        <p>For years, Danco Laboratories, the small private company that will distribute the abortion-inducing pill, mifepristone, has kept a low profile.</p>
        <p>The company's main telephone number is not listed. The receptionist does not mention the company's name as she picks up the phone. Instead, she says only, ''May I help you?'' As for its address, Danco's spokeswoman will say only that the company is  somewhere in ''midtown Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>Such discretion is understandable considering the volatility of the abortion debate. The company's employees would naturally want to work in relative peace.</p>
        <p>But with Thursday's regulatory approval of mifepristone behind it, the company said yesterday that it was coming out a bit. Danco, which calls itself a women's health company, has unveiled a Web site (www.earlyoptionpill.com), opened a toll-free telephone number (1-877-432-7596) and is now issuing press releases.</p>
        <p>''There are so many ways for people to get in touch with us,'' said Heather O'Neill, Danco's spokeswoman. ''We're definitely going to be out and about.''</p>
        <p>Danco plans to begin selling mifepristone, which it calls Mifeprex, in about a month, Ms. O'Neill said. Unlike most other drugs, mifepristone will not be available in pharmacies, she said. Instead, doctors will be able to order it from national distributors.</p>
        <p>There are still many things that Danco will not disclose, including the names of its investors. Ms. O'Neill said the group included wealthy individuals and foundations that supported abortion rights.</p>
        <p>''Our investors are very committed to making this available,'' she said. But they also hope to make a profit, she said.</p>
        <p>One investor is the David and Lucile Packard Foundation in Los Altos, Calif. Mr. Packard was a co-founder of the Hewlett-Packard Company.</p>
        <p>Sarah Clark, director of the population program at the Packard foundation, said yesterday that the foundation gave Danco a $10 million loan in 1998. ''This is an area that we're supportive of,'' Ms. Clark said.</p>
        <p>Another foundation, the Open Society Institute in New York, has not invested in Danco but has given grants to several groups that are working to help make mifepristone available.</p>
        <p>Ellen Chesler, a senior fellow at the institute, which is headed by the investor George Soros, said the foundation had given grants to groups like Planned Parenthood to help train employees in doctor's offices on the use of the drug. It has also given a $380,000 grant, Ms. Chesler said, to researchers studying whether a dosage lower than what regulators approved for the drug could be used.</p>
        <p>''We believe this offers women an important alternative,'' Ms. Chesler said.</p>
        <p>In 1994, Roussel-Uclaf, a French drugmaker, donated the rights to sell mifepristone in the United States to the Population Council, a large nonprofit group in New York City that conducts international research on reproductive health. The council tried to get large drug companies to develop and sell the drug, but all declined.</p>
        <p>Sandra Waldman, the council's spokeswoman, said the council then interviewed several groups that were interested in licensing the rights to the pill and distributing it once it was approved. In 1995, the council settled on a group headed by Joseph Pike, a lawyer turned entrepreneur. But the council filed a lawsuit against Mr. Pike when it discovered that he had been disbarred after pleading guilty to forgery.</p>
        <p>The rights to the drug were then transferred to Danco in 1997, Ms. Waldman said. She said many of the investors who had been supporting Mr. Pike's efforts were now backing Danco.</p>
        <p>Danco is essentially the same company that was operated by Mr. Pike, Mr. Waldman said, except its management was replaced in 1997.</p>
        <p>Danco is now managed by its chief executive, Roy Karnovsky, a drug marketing executive who worked at Merck, the pharmaceutical giant, for about 20 years. Mr. Karnovsky was not available for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Danco has hired another company to manufacture the drug. Ms. O'Neill said she could not disclose the name or country of that company. She said few drug companies would disclose such information about their manufacturers.</p>
        <p>Danco hopes to develop other products in the future, Ms. O'Neill said, although it now is focusing its efforts on mifepristone. Besides selling the pill for use in abortions, she said, the company is doing preliminary research to determine whether the drug could help patients with brain tumors or ovarian cancer.</p>
