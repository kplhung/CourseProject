        <p>They were headed for a rare weekend back home: Scott Frost to Nebraska, Victor Green to Atlanta, Al Groh to the 85th birthday party for his old coach at Chaminade High School in Mineola.</p>
        <p>Then there was Mike Nolan, the defensive coordinator of the 4-0 Jets. He is heading for Jacksonville, Fla., so he can watch the Jaguars play the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. It is rare for a high-ranking pro coach to scout an upcoming opponent, but Nolan is taking advantage of the Jets' idle weekend to see the Steelers, who will be at Giants Stadium a week later to face the Jets.</p>
        <p>When Nolan took over the defense, Green, the strong safety, recalled today: ''He said, 'Whatever it takes. I'll mop floors. I'll pick up paper.' Rather than spend time with his family on a bye week, he'll go to a game. That's unusual for a coordinator. You usually get your assistants to do that.''</p>
        <p>But this is not the first time Nolan has been willing to travel to see an opponent play. During another Jets' bye week, in the final week of the preseason, Nolan attended a Packers exhibition game at Green Bay. The Packers were the Jets' opening-game opponent.</p>
        <p>Nolan's willingness to travel on what would ordinarily be free time is his way of showing the defense that sacrifices must be made. Nolan, once a celebrated defensive assistant for the Giants, had a brutal time in Washington, where the owner Daniel Snyder quarreled with the Redskins' head coach, Norv Turner, over keeping him.</p>
        <p>So Nolan came to the Jets to replace Bill Belichick, who resigned after a day as the Jets' new head coach last January to coach the Patriots. Belichick had been the defensive coordinator and the coach for the defensive backs under Bill Parcells, and his tactical skills were widely admired by his players. They believed that in any situation, Belichick would find the answer. He usually did.</p>
        <p>''Now Mike has earned his position,'' Green said. ''He can say, 'This is my defense.' He's a lot more heard now than when he first came here. I watched. He was like a player coming into a new system. A lot of players knew more than he did.''</p>
        <p>Nolan is not expected to come away with a magical formula to use against the Steelers, who are 0-3. But he will most likely get a sense of how the Steelers move and how they perform under pressure.</p>
        <p>''Mike likes to go to get the pace of the game, the substitutions,'' said Groh, the Jets' head coach. And perhaps, Groh added, Nolan is superstitious; the Jets won their opener against Green Bay.</p>
        <p>'' 'If it makes you feel good about things, then go to Jacksonville,' I told him,'' Groh said.</p>
        <p>Although the Steelers are hardly the Men of Steel these days, they are in some ways an unknown quantity for the Jets, who have not faced them since 1992. The Jets' overall record against Pittsburgh is 1-12.</p>
        <p>''We're very deep into preparing for Pittsburgh,'' said Groh, who used this week to pore over film of the Steelers. ''This will mark the second consecutive game against an opponent we don't know very well.'' The Jets' last game was against Tampa Bay, a team they had not faced in three years. The Jets won, 21-17.</p>
        <p>The Jets might well be facing a familiar figure at quarterback in Kent Graham. He will start against Jacksonville, but there is always the possibility the Jets could face Kordell Stewart. Graham, a former Giant, is more susceptible than Stewart to the kind of pass rush that Nolan's defense has developed. The Jets are leveling quarterbacks at one of the highest rates in the league, having produced 11 sacks.</p>
        <p>Nolan has apparently been establishing his own identity, as well as a new one for the defense.</p>
        <p>''There's not too many clones around right now,'' Groh said. ''The only ones are sheep.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>AL GROH is one of five people without previous National Football League head-coaching experience to begin at 4-0 since the 1970 merger of the American Football League and the N.F.L. The others were CHUCK KNOX with the Los Angeles Rams in 1973 (they finished 12-2); RED MILLER at Denver in 1977 (finished 12-2); RICH BROOKS of the St. Louis Rams in 1995 (finished 7-9) and MIKE MARTZ of the Rams this year. . . . A key ingredient to 4-0: The Jets are the only team in the league that has not lost a fumble this season. . . . Groh was asked under what circumstances the rookie quarterback CHAD PENNINGTON might get into a game: ''There would have to be a multicar wreck on the way to Giants Stadium,'' Groh said.  . . . The Jets return to work Tuesday, trying to extend the league's longest current regular-season winning streak: eight games dating to last season. The Jets' longest winning streak was nine games in 1986, which ended with five straight losses as the team collapsed under the weight of injuries to key players.</p>
