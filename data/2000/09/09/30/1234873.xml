        <p>After some prominent Christian conservatives grumbled about Gov. George W. Bush's decision to skip the Christian Coalition's annual conference this weekend, the Bush campaign reversed itself today and announced that the governor would address the convention by videotape on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The announcement of Mr. Bush's change of heart came after Pat Robertson, the Christian Coalition chairman and founder, had complained earlier this week, and again today, that Mr. Bush was ''taking a risk'' by not speaking before the group.</p>
        <p>''I think it's up to him to encourage this base to come out and work,'' Mr. Robertson told reporters this morning. ''We'll do what we can. But if he doesn't, then he's taking a risk.''</p>
        <p>Responding to questions about whether Mr. Bush, who has tried to avoid being labeled as too conservative, was trying to distance himself from the evangelical organization, Mr. Robertson replied, ''He's not distancing himself, but he's taking a risk. He thinks that he has the Christian base all locked up.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he thought that Mr. Bush indeed had the Christian conservative vote in hand, Mr. Robertson smiled and said, ''We'll find out the first week of November.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Robertson's remarks echoed concerns he raised when aides to Mr. Bush said he would not attend the convention because he would be preparing for the debate with Vice President Al Gore next week.</p>
        <p>The Christian Coalition has been considered a powerful ally of the Republican Party and its presidential nominees since it was created in 1989. In 1992, President George Bush  spoke before the group. In 1996, Bob Dole made a surprise appearance at the conference -- though only after coming under sharp criticism for initially turning down an invitation.</p>
        <p>One presidential candidate who wanted to address the convention but was not invited was Patrick J. Buchanan, the Reform Party nominee.  An aide to Mr. Buchanan, a popular figure among Christian conservatives, said his campaign made repeated overtures to Christian Coalition officials seeking an invitation, but never got a response.</p>
        <p>Critics of the coalition said that snubbing Mr. Buchanan showed that the group had become an appendage to the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>There was little doubt in the convention hall today that Mr. Bush had the group's overwhelming support. The featured speakers included most of the Republican Congressional leadership, all of whom promoted Mr. Bush's campaign agenda.</p>
        <p>Lynne Cheney, wife of Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, used her afternoon speech to challenge the honesty of Vice President Al Gore.  Mrs. Cheney accused the Democrats of duplicity for criticizing the entertainment industry for marketing adult materials to children, and then accepting its campaign contributions, and of trying to mislead voters about their views on abortion.</p>
        <p>''They try to make it seem as though they want abortion to be rare,'' Mrs. Cheney said. ''But they celebrate when the Food and Drug Administration approves RU-486. They want to make it seem as though they are reasonable people, and then they support one of the most horrendous outrages against life, partial birth abortion.''</p>
        <p>Most of the speakers warned that a Democratic president would appoint federal judges that would tolerate abortion rights. But to an unusual degree, many of the speakers avoided the kind of heated words on contentious social issues that had typified past conventions. That is in keeping with the tone of Mr. Bush's campaign, which has focused on education and economic issues.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Robertson, who in 1996 complained that Mr. Dole seemed to be running for ''chief accountant'' by emphasizing economic issues over moral ones, devoted much of his speech to advocating tax cuts and smaller government.</p>
        <p>Many people here said that they would like to hear Mr. Bush talk more about his opposition to abortion, as well as other moral issues. But most said they understood that he might have to minimize those views to win centrist voters.</p>
        <p>''This way he won't offend people who are pro-choice,'' said Jeffrey P. Schneider, the chairman of the Christian Coalition in Kankakee County, Ill. ''He's making a smart political move.''</p>
