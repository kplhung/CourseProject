        <p>Rose Period. Blue Period. Cubist phase. Fuggedaboudit.</p>
        <p>In a curious collage of the worlds of fine art and organized crime, two men described by federal prosecutors as associates of the Gambino crime family and a New Jersey man who runs an offshore Internet gambling operation were charged yesterday with trying to sell five forged or stolen paintings, including two phony Picassos, for  about $35 million.</p>
        <p>Aside from the Picassos, the alleged Gambino associates, Dominick Curra and Kevin McMahon, and the businessman, Robert Walsh, were accused of trying to sell a fake Chagall, a canvas said to be by the Spanish artist Fernando Botero and a stolen painting falsely attributed to the Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens, federal prosecutors said. The three men loaded images of the canvases on to a computer disk and shopped the disk around to would-be buyers, according to court papers filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Their scheme, however, was as inept as the brushwork on their forgeries, prosecutors said. The first buyer they approached, the government said, turned them in.</p>
        <p>The buyer, an unnamed man who had pleaded guilty to securities fraud and was already cooperating with federal agents, called the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn in March and told investigators that Mr. Walsh had approached him trying to sell the five paintings. Mr. Walsh, the government says, told the buyer that the four fakes were worth more than $5 million and that the stolen painting was valued at $30 million and had once been owned by ''a real gangster.''</p>
        <p>Days later, Mr. Walsh delivered the buyer a squat-looking portrait of a bull that included a scrawled signature in the bottom-left corner that read ''Picasso.'' The same day, an art expert working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation examined the painting and pronounced it ''a blatant forgery'' that was virtually worthless, court papers say.</p>
        <p>Over the next two months, the buyer, working with federal agents, saw the other four paintings. According to court papers, Mr. Walsh told the buyer that the Rubens was an original piece that been stolen from an art gallery 30 years ago. But the government said that while the painting actually had been stolen, it was worth only $2,000 and had been created by an unknown artist who studied with Rubens.</p>
        <p>As for the Botero -- a portrait of a woman and child -- Mr. Curra informed the buyer that it was ''special'' because it came ''from a house in the Hamptons,'' court documents say. The government says Mr. Curra wanted at least $75,000 for the painting though it, too, was a fake.</p>
        <p>At one point, Mr. Walsh, Mr. Curra and Mr. McMahon concocted a scheme to give their forgeries additional cachet by placing them in expensive frames and trying to have them displayed at a tony Upper East Side gallery, federal prosecutors said. They enlisted the help of their would-be buyer, the prosecutors added, who told the three men that a gallery owner he knew could hang the paintings next to ''the best art in the world.'' But before the paintings could be hung, the scheme unraveled and the men were arrested.</p>
        <p>Jim Margolin, a spokesman for the F.B.I., said that it was unclear who painted the forgeries and that he did not know whether the mob had commissioned them. He added it was unusual for the gangsters to be involved in the art business. ''I can't recall another instance of this in my experience and recollection,'' he said. ''But it certainly stood to be a money maker.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McMahon, 35, of the Howard Beach section of Queens, and Mr. Walsh, 35, of Fort Lee, N.J., remained in custody yesterday. Mr. Curra, 56, of Lawrence, N.Y., was released on $750,000 bail.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Walsh's lawyer, Steven Brounstein, nor Mr. Curra's lawyer, Michael Schneider, would comment on the case. Mr. McMahon appeared in court yesterday without any legal representation. Prosecutors said Mr. Curra and Mr. McMahon are associates of Charles Carneglia, who was described in court papers as a Gambino soldier.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 9, 2000, Monday  An article on Sept. 30 about arrests in an organized crime scheme to sell forged paintings over the Internet included an erroneous reference from federal prosecutors to the nationality of Fernando Botero, one artist whose paintings were forged. He is Colombian, not Spanish.</p>
