        <p>Several new books about Robert E Lee and Ulysses S Grant offer new characterizations that differ greatly from long-held notions; Lee, long considered brilliant tactician fighting against overwhelming odds is now thought to have been overly aggressive and squandered limited resources; idea that he opposed slavery is discounted by James M McPherson, Princeton historian and author; Grant's military leadership and presidency are also re-evaluated and cast in better light and extent of his drinking is in doubt; John Y Simon, historian at Southern Illinois University and editor of Grant's papers confirms Grant's dedication to racial equality and contends his popularity dropped as country abandoned his Reconstruction policies; photo (M)</p>

        <p>For the better part of the last century the images of two of the greatest icons of the Civil War remained fixed in the American imagination: Robert E. Lee as the noble and tragic leader of the Confederate forces, the brilliant tactician fighting against overwhelming odds, and Ulysses S. Grant as the heavy-drinking butcher who used the North's superior resources to grind down the South, then became one of the worst presidents in the nation's history.</p>
        <p>Those characterizations are now being challenged by a string of books that are both more admiring of Grant and more skeptical of Lee than would have seemed imaginable only a short time ago.

        <p>For the better part of the last century the images of two of the greatest icons of the Civil War remained fixed in the American imagination: Robert E. Lee as the noble and tragic leader of the Confederate forces, the brilliant tactician fighting against overwhelming odds, and Ulysses S. Grant as the heavy-drinking butcher who used the North's superior resources to grind down the South, then became one of the worst presidents in the nation's history.</p>
        <p>Those characterizations are now being challenged by a string of books that are both more admiring of Grant and more skeptical of Lee than would have seemed imaginable only a short time ago. Some historians trace the change to broader shifts over the last few decades in scholars' attitudes toward the Civil War and Reconstruction and in public attitudes toward race.</p>
        <p>There is now what Gary W. Gallagher, a Civil War historian at the University of Virginia, calls a cottage industry in books criticizing Lee's generalship -- faulting him for his aggressiveness, accusing him of having squandered limited manpower and arguing that he needlessly prolonged the war. The long-held idea that Lee opposed slavery, at least at times, has also been discounted.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, several new books on Grant portray him as an extraordinary general who gave a new dimension to American military strategy, whose casualties were proportionally fewer than Lee's, who not only fought to save the Union and free the slaves but also worked hard to enforce Reconstruction and black equality in the South long after it ceased to be popular. Even the extent of his drinking is in doubt.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that a re-evaluation is under way,'' said Jean Edward Smith, a historian at Marshall University in Huntington, W.Va., whose biography, ''Grant,'' is scheduled to be published by Simon &amp; Schuster on April 9, the anniversary of Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House. ''And that has several roots. The first is the re-evaluation of the Civil War and the aftermath and the whole question of slavery and our reassessment of the white South.''</p>
        <p>James M. McPherson, a historian at Princeton and the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book ''Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era'' (Oxford University Press, 1988), said, ''The kind of romanticized sympathy-with-the-underdog attitude to the Confederacy has been increasingly outweighed by the recognition that what the Confederacy was fighting for was a society based on slavery. And what the North was fighting for, if not initially and always enthusiastically, was a society moving toward biracial democracy.''</p>
        <p>Though some earlier writers, like J. F. C. Fuller and Bruce Catton, had challenged the dominant perceptions of Grant and Lee, the current change in tone seems to have begun in 1991 with the publication of ''Lee Considered: Gen. Robert E. Lee and Civil War History,'' in which Alan T. Nolan, a now-retired labor relations lawyer, argued that Lee's aggressiveness led to his defeat.</p>
        <p>At least four other books have followed: ''Uncertain Glory: Lee's Generalship Re-examined'' by John D. McKenzie, ''How Robert E. Lee Lost the Civil War'' by Edward H. Bonekemper III, ''Robert E. Lee's Civil War'' by Bevin Alexander and ''Lee Moves North: Robert E. Lee on the Offensive'' by Michael A. Palmer.</p>
        <p>''I think there was a constituency out there that was kind of fed up with the Lee myth, and once somebody started nailing it, they all came out of the woodwork,'' said Mr. Nolan, whose book was favorably reviewed by historians but was also excoriated on the editorial page of The Richmond News Leader as ''a lawyer's brief'' against Lee.</p>
        <p>At least as many recent histories and biographies are reassessing Grant's military and political careers, among them: ''President Grant Reconsidered'' by Frank J. Scaturro, ''Ulysses S. Grant: Soldier &amp; President'' by Geoffrey Perret and ''Ulysses S. Grant: Triumph Over Adversity, 1822-1865'' by Brooks D. Simpson, a historian at Arizona State University who is working on a second volume.</p>
        <p>Three novels about Grant were published last summer. The PBS series ''American Experience'' is preparing a two-part biography of Grant. And Joan Waugh, a historian at the University of California at Los Angeles, is writing a book on the memorialization of Grant in the 19th century.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to unravel the puzzle of how someone could be literally equated with Washington and Lincoln in almost every memorial -- how could and why did his reputation fall so low?'' Ms. Waugh said in an interview. ''I think his reputation was under serious challenge as early as the 1890's. Because with the rise of Robert E. Lee and 'the Lost Cause' came the diminution of the Union cause.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Waugh and others trace the glorification of Lee to the turn of the last century and the attempt to reunify the country and move beyond the war. As Eric Foner, a historian at Columbia University, explained, Lee was held up as someone the entire nation could look back on with pride, an embodiment of the nobility of the South, courage against great odds and devotion to principle.</p>
        <p>To put the best possible spin on the war, Southern writers in the post-bellum years characterized the South's shattering defeat as an honorable effort against impossible odds, Mr. Gallagher said. And to distance the Confederacy from the taint of slavery, those so-called Lost Cause writers suggested that the war was not about slavery but about constitutional issues.</p>
        <p>''Lee as the exemplar of slave-owning aristocracy was romanticized by three generations of Southern historians,'' said Mr. Smith, the Grant biographer. ''Grant was denigrated by this same school of historiography, which really dominated American thought through World War II.''</p>
        <p>John Y. Simon, a historian at Southern Illinois University and the editor of Grant's papers, who in recent years has collected and published many documents that had previously been inaccessible, said Grant's reputation dropped to an all-time low in the 1930's, at the time of the country's complete abandonment of the Reconstruction policies  Grant had worked to uphold.</p>
        <p>Now, however, Mr. Smith in his new book emphasizes Grant's dedication to racial equality, his support for black suffrage and for Lincoln's policy of admitting black soldiers into the Army, his efforts as president to crush the Ku Klux Klan and his pursuit of a peace policy in the West, under which he reversed a planned war of extermination against the Plains Indians.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the current reassessments have not gone entirely unchallenged, especially with regard to Lee. Mr. Gallagher, who says that Mr. Nolan did a good job of getting people to look more realistically at important aspects of Lee's life, dismisses much of the criticism of Lee as a soldier. ''I think they're almost dead wrong in terms of Lee's impact on Confederate fortunes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''In many ways, much of the negative work on Lee is as much a caricature of him as the unabashedly hagiographic work was a caricature of him before,'' Mr. Gallagher said. ''But I think inevitably in the long run it's going to be harder and less likely that any Confederate figure could be as widely extolled as Lee was in the past.''</p>
