        <p>Re ''40 States Forfeit Health Care Funds for Poor Children'' (front page, Sept. 24):</p>
        <p>As one who has worked with low-income families for more than 20 years, I was deeply troubled to learn that my state, California, must return $590 million in unspent federal money that was meant to insure children in low-income families.</p>
        <p>To his credit, Gov. Gray Davis streamlined the enrollment process after taking office in January 1999. But the vast majority of eligible children have not elected to join.</p>
        <p>Now that 40 states have failed, the best way to get care to our country's 11 million uninsured children is to automatically enroll any child who qualifies for a free school lunch and further expand the safety net with neighborhood health centers and school-based clinics.</p>
