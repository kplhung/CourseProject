        <p>Ed Harris's powerful biographical film ''Pollock'' may be the first movie about a painter to transcend the gushy cliches found in movies that try to unravel the mysteries of artistic creation. It helps, of course, that Jackson Pollock, the Abstract Expressionist giant whom Mr. Harris portrays with a riveting blend of pent-up passion and unleashed physicality, threw his entire body into his work.</p>
        <p>And the scenes of Pollock standing over a giant canvas and creating his famous drip paintings in graceful swooping gestures as the camera discreetly dances around him offer a visceral thrill similar to watching a brilliantly choreographed action-adventure sequence.</p>
        <p>Because it's art that's being made, there's an added emotional kick. What we're witnessing isn't a succession of exploding cars, but an utterly convincing release of pure feeling deployed with the concentration and discipline of a natural athlete executing an unparalleled feat after years of preparation. There's also an added element of magic, of conjuring, as something emerges out of nothing, and the blank canvas at Pollock's feet is transformed into a thickening, swirling, emotionally charged tangle of color.</p>
        <p>No actor is better suited than Mr. Harris to portray the artist, who knew Tennessee Williams and was said to have been an inspiration for Stanley Kowalski, the instinctive brute who galvanizes ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' And in ''Pollock,'' the tense domestic clashes between the artist and his wife, the painter Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden), are subtly staged to recall the electrifying chemistry of Marlon Brando and Kim Hunter in the film of ''Streetcar.''</p>
        <p>More than any contemporary actor, Mr. Harris has always resembled the young Brando in his projection of an archetypal manliness devoid of vanity, the kind of guy whose swagger doesn't have a trace of affectation. This highly intelligent actor may lack the young Brando's poetic quality, but he is so good at embodying unself-conscious masculinity that he has often seemed imprisoned in stereotypes of the stoic, square-jawed all-American Joe.</p>
        <p>If Pollock was a man's man, he was also a walking tornado, a ferociously ambitious egotist, a surly, violent drunk, and as portrayed in the film, adapted by the screenwriters Barbara Turner and Susan J. Emshwiller from a biography by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, a tormented fatalist. The film is unsparing in its portrait of Pollock's self-annihilating benders and rages. At his lowest points, he is a gnarled, slavering, purple-faced beast growling, sobbing and shaking uncontrollably. When angry, he upends dining room tables piled with food and hurls the vilest profanity with a demonic viciousness.</p>
        <p>In the film's saddest scene, Pollock, who has been laboriously going through the motions of Action Painting for a film showing him in the throes of creativity, realizes that what's he's doing is phony and at that instant senses that his most important work is behind him. Then and there, he abruptly and deliberately ends two years of abstinence by pouring booze down his throat and turning into a monster in a matter of minutes.</p>
        <p>For the remainder of his short life he is both a celebrity and a self-loathing alcoholic. In making ''Pollock,'' Mr. Harris, like Robert De Niro for ''Raging Bull,'' put on more than 30 pounds and a beard to play the bloated, dissipated artist in his final years. Ultimately the movie suggests that the car crash in which he and one of two female companions died in 1956 was a deliberate suicide run.</p>
        <p>The official centerpiece of the New York Film Festival, which is showing it at Alice Tully Hall this evening and tomorrow afternoon, ''Pollock'' has the formulaic construction of a television biography. It begins late in Pollock's life with his introduction to Ruth Kligman (Jennifer Connelly), the survivor of the car crash, who fawningly asks the artist to autograph the Life magazine article that made him famous. From there it flashes back to the lean years in Greenwich Village; his meeting and marrying Krasner, with whom he painted in adjacent studios; and the couple's move to the Springs in East Hampton, followed by Pollock's meteoric rise and decline.</p>
        <p>Two of the major figures in Pollock's life make vivid appearances. As Clement Greenberg, Pollock's greatest critical champion and sometime thorn in the side, Jeffrey Tambor booms with puffed-up pronouncements. Amy Madigan plays Peggy Guggenheim, the wealthy art collector who became an early patron, as a shrewd, hard-edged bohemian. But there are many more characters than the film can comfortably handle. Pollock's family members, who troop in and out of the movie, remain shadowy, as do his fellow artists. (Val Kilmer's Willem de Kooning looks right but has only a sentence or two.)</p>
        <p>Although the movie does a handsome job of evoking Greenwich Village and eastern Long Island in much leaner times (Lisa Rinzler's cinematography conjures a mood of clean austerity) and has fine sense of period detail (the Gene Krupa and Billie Holiday music is just right) it concentrates most of its energy on Pollock's artistic and personal struggles. The screenplay succeeds in packing in a lot of artistic debate and theory without becoming too bloated.</p>
        <p>Besides its Action Painting sequences, the film's biggest triumph is its richly shaded portrayal of the complicated Pollock-Krasner relationship. A blunt-spoken bohemian woman from Brooklyn, Krasner, who instigated the affair, knew early on that Pollock was a genius and became his tireless champion and promoter even in the worst of times. But she was no doormat. She knew exactly what she wanted and didn't want and had no trouble standing up to her turbulent husband.</p>
        <p>In one of the film's most remarkable scenes, she ridicules his suggestion that they have a child with a scalding harangue in which she lists the reasons they shouldn't. Ms. Harden's performance is as uncompromisingly tough as Mr. Harris's. And the pleasure of watching these two superb actors play figures of such stature without a trace of sentimentality is enormous.</p>
        <p>Yes, the movie has flaws and inaccuracies. Presumably for reasons of economy, the discussion about painting from nature that elicited Pollock's famous retort, ''I am nature,'' becomes a conversation with Krasner instead of with Hans Hofmann. And the movie dubiously implies that Pollock's inspiration for his drip paintings was his accidental spattering of paint onto the floor while working on a nondrip canvas and having a visionary flash.</p>
        <p>But ''Pollock'' is, for the most part, admirable. It reminds us that great art isn't about creating beauty out of misty-eyed Hallmark moments but about discovering and communicating messy truths that spill all over the place, just like the lives of the artists driven to uncover them.</p>
