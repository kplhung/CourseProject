        <p>Mattel Inc. said yesterday that it was selling the Learning Company, its educational software unit, to the Gores Technology Group, a private equity buyout firm based in Los Angeles. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Mattel said it would take an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of about $430 million. Mattel paid $3.6 billion for the Learning Company in May 1999. The move was meant to broaden Mattel's reach, but instead it contributed to huge losses, a steep drop in the company's stock and the resignation of Jill Barad as chief executive. Mattel also said yesterday that it would cut about 350 jobs at its headquarters and reduce its dividend from a quarterly 9 cents a share to an annual 5 cents a share.</p>
