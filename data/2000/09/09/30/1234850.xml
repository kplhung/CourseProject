        <p>Baseball officials held lots of discussions, but made no decision yesterday on whether to change the plan to have the Yankees play a makeup game Monday, the day after the regular season is scheduled to end.</p>
        <p>''A lot of conversations are going on,'' said Gene Orza, the players association official who questioned the propriety of having the Yankees play the Florida Marlins on Monday at Yankee Stadium. ''We still have some talking to do.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees were notified Thursday to plan for the makeup game.</p>
        <p>The Oakland Athletics were told to plan for a game at Tampa Bay on Monday evening as a makeup of a game postponed on Sept. 17.</p>
        <p>There may be a real need for the Athletics to play their game, depending on the outcomes of games this weekend.</p>
        <p>If the Athletics and the Seattle Mariners were to be half a game apart in the American League West standing after tomorrow's games -- and both had not already made the playoffs -- the makeup game would be critical to their division's final standing and to the determination of which team went to the postseason.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, however, would be playing only to determine home-field advantage in the first round (Games 1, 2 and 5).</p>
        <p>Orza said games were not supposed to be made up the day after the regular season ended unless the games would determine playoff eligibility.</p>
        <p>The Mariners could benefit from the Yankees' game with the Marlins. If the Yankees are half a game ahead of the Mariners after tomorrow's games, and then lose to the Marlins, they would have the same record as Seattle.</p>
        <p>The Mariners, if they were the A.L. West champions, would gain the home-field advantage by having won their season series with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>The Yankees could gain the home-field advantage if they, the Mariners and the Athletics finish with the same record and the two A.L. West teams are assured of playoff spots.</p>
        <p>In that scenario, the Athletics would be declared division champions, because they beat the Mariners in their season series.</p>
        <p>The Yankees would get the home-field advantage, because they won the season series from Oakland.</p>
        <p>Compounding the bizarre makeup situation, the manager of the Marlins, John Boles, raised doubts yesterday that one of his team's best players, Preston Wilson, would appear in a Monday game at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Wilson has played every game this season and, after last night's opener of a three-game series with Philadelphia, he has 31 home runs, 119 runs batted in and 35 stolen bases, the only 30-30 player in the majors this year.</p>
        <p>But Wilson also has 186 strikeouts, three short of Bobby Bonds's major league record, and Wilson's manager seems intent on not having his outfielder become a negative record-holder. ''Preston Wilson is not playing after he gets two strikeouts,'' Boles insisted yesterday in Miami.</p>
