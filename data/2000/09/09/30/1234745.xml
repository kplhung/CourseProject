        <p>It's not often that choreographers serve audiences cake. But Reggie Wilson did that on Wednesday night when his Reggie Wilson/Fist and Heel Performance Group appeared at Dance Theater Workshop. The occasion was his 33rd birthday.</p>
        <p>He has had several 33rd-birthday parties this year for, as he explained in welcoming remarks, it is his custom to devote an entire month to such celebrations. In addition to the cake, he gave dancegoers another treat, a heartwarming program with the overall title of ''Wangena: The Birthday Concerts.''</p>
        <p>It began with ''Introduction,'' a little speech that developed into a solo dance as Mr. Wilson spoke of his devotion to studying the influences of African dances and cultural traditions in the United States and the Caribbean. Mr. Wilson punctuated his words with rhythmic sways, gentle stamps and meditative humming that filled the solo with a quiet fervor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson is deeply interested in how people of many faiths respond to what is often called the Holy Spirit. In ''Vanitystarts@home,'' Mr. Wilson, sitting on the floor, pushed himself laboriously forward with his arms, as if undergoing an arduous ordeal on a spiritual quest.</p>
        <p>Nicole Falloon, Penelope Kalloo and Stephanie Tooman appeared to be defying adversity in ''Rise Sally Rise.'' So, too, in ''Pang,'' Ms. Kalloo, Ms. Tooman, Paul Hamilton and Richard Rivera might have been summoning powers to guide them in a struggle to survive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson was not totally sobersided in his choreography. His ''Jumping the Broom'' also concerned a form of survival. But in this deadpan comic sketch, Rhetta Aleong and Mr. Hamilton portrayed two grumpy lovers who, after great efforts to stay together, decided it was time to part.</p>
        <p>The evening's accompaniment included recordings and fine vocal music from various folk traditions sung by Elaine Flowers, Lawrence Harding and some of the dancers.</p>
