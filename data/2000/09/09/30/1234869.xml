        <p>Violence erupted in the sacred, contested center of Jerusalem's Old City today as stones and bullets interrupted a day of prayer for Muslims and Jews, turning it bloody.</p>
        <p>Four Palestinians were killed at Haram al Sharif, known to Jews as Temple Mount, in a second day of rioting that began when Ariel Sharon, the rightist opposition leader, visited the Muslim compound on Thursday to assert Jewish claims to the site.</p>
        <p>Wearing full riot gear, Israeli police officers today stormed the Muslim area, where they rarely set foot, to disperse Palestinian youths who emerged from Friday prayer services to stone first a police post at the Moghrabi Gate and then Jewish worshipers at the Western Wall.</p>
        <p>By day's end, more than 200 people, including five tourists, were wounded -- including the Jerusalem police commander, Yair Yitzhaki, who was being held overnight in a hospital for observation.</p>
        <p>One 48-year-old Palestinian man was left brain-dead, a rubber-coated metal bullet lodged in his skull, according to his brother-in-law, Abu Walid, who hovered over his hospital bed with bloodstains on his own white shirt.</p>
        <p>Israeli-Palestinian tensions, heightened today by the violence at the holy site, were worsened by a breakdown in security cooperation elsewhere. In the West Bank, a Palestinian soldier who was working in a joint Israeli-Palestinian patrol shot and killed an Israeli colleague today. Palestinian officials said the Palestinian soldier was mentally unbalanced.</p>
        <p>And another Israeli soldier was buried today. He had been killed earlier this week near a Jewish settlement in the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip by a roadside bomb, one of two bombs that also wounded other Israeli soldiers.</p>
        <p>Contrasting smells and sounds filled the Holy City today. On the one hand, the wailing ambulances advertised the bloodshed; on the other, the wafting aroma of chicken soup communicated the approach of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, which usually blankets Jewish neighborhoods in a serene hush.</p>
        <p>This morning, both sides started out tense, after clashes on Thursday provoked by Mr. Sharon's visit. A bitter dispute over the site's sovereignty has deadlocked the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, awakening deep-seated religious tensions.</p>
        <p>The Temple Mount is always a powder keg, but a decades-old arrangement usually keeps conflict in check. Since Israel occupied the Old City in the aftermath of the Arab-Israeli war of 1967, it has claimed sovereignty over the entire huge stone structure. But it has permitted the Islamic authorities to exercise control over the two ancient mosques and the great stone plaza on top. The Western Wall beneath, guarded by Israeli soldiers, is the most sacred site of worship for Jews.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Mr. Sharon, who opposes Prime Minister Ehud Barak's efforts to explore such alternatives as international control of the mount, strode into a very fragile situation. His visit set off a dynamic of confrontation that, with funerals being scheduled for the Palestinian victims who will be viewed as martyrs, has now taken on a life of its own.</p>
        <p>At the holy site today, split-level chaos ensued among those not directly involved in the confrontations.  Down at the Western Wall, which was filled with Jews swaying in prayer to welcome Rosh Hashana, the police evacuated screaming men, women and children.</p>
        <p>''We were in the middle of the special prayers for the afternoon before Rosh Hashana,'' said Yosef Yacobovich, 28, who was visiting from England.</p>
        <p>''Suddenly, the police shouted that we must evacuate the compound,'' he said. '' 'Don't be nervous, don't be nervous,' they said. But the rocks were falling. The biggest barrage came once we were out of the plaza area, looking back.''</p>
        <p>Up above, after the shooting started, older Muslim men ran awkwardly, tripping over stones, into Al Aksa Mosque to seek shelter. Some youths were shouting, ''God is great!'' while one man seized the mosque's loudspeaker to yell: ''People are being massacred! Bring the ambulances!''</p>
        <p>The violence took place at an unfortunate moment for the Israeli leader. Mr. Barak, facing a vote of no confidence when Parliament reconvenes at the end of October, believes that he cannot afford to lose time on the peace track.</p>
        <p>Although the talks are stalemated, Mr. Barak and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, made a successful effort this week to re-establish a personal connection in order to cushion the tense negotiations. A late-night dinner at Mr. Barak's private home in Kochav Yair was the best meeting ever between the two leaders. But it will be difficult to build on the improved chemistry now.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, before the violence, Mr. Arafat telephoned Mr. Barak to express his sorrow for death of the Israeli soldiers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, on the other hand, issued a statement saying such attacks on Israeli soldiers ''require Palestinian activity to prevent them,'' and claimed that they endangered the peace effort. Later, in another statement, he urged the Palestinians and Muslim religious officials to work toward controlling the tensions.</p>
        <p>Today, Muslim officials tried at first to restrain the Palestinian youths, witnesses and the Israeli police said. But the police responded very quickly to the stones, surging into the mosque area and shooting rubber-coated metal bullets first in the air, then at the youths' feet, then directly at the rioters, a police spokesman said later.</p>
        <p>Then, according to witnesses and to the Israeli police, the Muslim officials lost control and stepped back as the confrontation between the youths and the officers took on an intensity of its own.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the violence ended, billowing smoke still darkened the classic Jerusalem image of the gilded Dome of the Rock, which hangs in Muslim homes around the world. The image usually does not include Israeli soldiers, M-16's in hand, just as the plaza of the mosque is not usually carpeted with flying stones. Palestinian protesters doused an effigy of Mr. Sharon with gasoline and lighted it, also burning pictures of the former general and defense minister.</p>
        <p>Dr. Khaled Qurei, director of the Makhased Hospital on the Mount of Olives, said the hospital had treated more than 150 men, women and youths, many of whom were wounded by rubber bullets and some by live ammunition. The Israeli police denied that live bullets had been used.</p>
        <p>''For all the years that I have been a commander and also when I was the Jerusalem police chief, I never prevented any prayers at the Temple Mount,'' said Yehuda Wilk, the Israeli police chief. ''But there cannot be a situation whereby the Muslims will pray on the mount and then attack policemen and try to stone Jewish worshipers below.''</p>
        <p>Adnan Husseini, director of the Islamic trust that controls the site, said: ''We warned the Israeli government that Sharon's visit would have dangerous consequences. Then, the presence of such a large number of Israeli forces one day after Sharon's provocative visit stirred up the worshipers. That is the reason for the confrontations today.''</p>
        <p>Chief Wilk, however, said Mr. Sharon's visit was ''legitimate.'' Other police officials suggested that the daily sermon at the mosque had riled up the worshipers. The sermon did denounce Mr. Sharon, and raise anxieties by talking about Jewish extremists who want to destroy the mosque and rebuild the ancient temple in its place.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Husseini said: ''They cannot blame us. We are not the ones who opened up fire.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 4, 2000, Wednesday  A picture caption on Saturday about fighting between Israelis and Palestinians in Jerusalem included an erroneous identification from The Associated Press for a wounded man shown with an Israeli policeman. He was Tuvia Grossman of Chicago, an American student in Israel, not an unidentified Palestinian. In some copies the caption also misidentified the site where Mr. Grossman was wounded. It was in Jerusalem's Old City, but not on the Temple Mount.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 7, 2000, Saturday  A picture caption on Page A6 last Saturday about fighting in Jerusalem gave an erroneous identification from The Associated Press for a wounded man shown with an Israeli policeman. He was Tuvia Grossman of Chicago, an American studying at a Jewish seminary in Jerusalem, not an unidentified Palestinian. In some copies the caption also included the news agency's erroneous reference to the site. The incident occurred in an Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem, not on the Temple Mount or elsewhere in the Old City.</p>
        <p>A correction in this space on Wednesday cited the errors incompletely and omitted an explanation of the scene. The officer was waving a nightstick at Palestinians, telling them to stay away from Mr. Grossman. He was not beating Mr. Grossman.</p>
        <p>An article about the incident and the photograph appears today, on Page A4.</p>
