        <p>The burly man with the powerful forearms and the peach-fuzz hair steered his kayak by the side of the dock, and came to rest. His chest swelled as he inhaled, before releasing the tension of another hurdle passed, another heat survived, and a doubling of the chances of living his dream.</p>
        <p>''Michael. . . . Michael,'' a voice called out from outside the water, from an Israeli journalists' contingent of one.</p>
        <p>''Mee-shel. . . . Mee-shel.''</p>
        <p>Michael Kolganov would not reply after qualifying for the men's K1 500 meters on Friday, would not so much as raise his head. He stayed motionless for several moments, until pushing off the dock and paddling away.</p>
        <p>''Before the Olympics, I tried to talk to him,'' said the Israeli television journalist, Amir Bar Shalom. ''He said, 'Until I win a medal, what is there to say?' ''</p>
        <p>When a country is watching, expectantly and judgmentally, what else can one do? In Kolganov's case, he has opted to go about his business, give everything, promise nothing.</p>
        <p>From the time he arrived in Israel five years ago from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, friendless and alone, 25-year-old Michael Kolganov has trained for this time, this weekend, the medal opportunities that awaited him. Today, he finished fourth in the final of the K1 1,000 meters, missing a bronze medal by 42-hundredths of a second.</p>
        <p>Sunday he gets another chance, Israel's last at a medal in these Olympics, in the 500-meter sprint, usually Kolganov's stronger event.</p>
        <p>Those who know him, like his teammate Rami Zur, say he has worked assiduously on the Kibbutz Degania in the Jordan Valley, near the Sea of Galilee. It has been his life, his reason for being, not only to become the world-class kayaker he now is, but to prove himself as an Israeli, justify the money he has received for repatriation, by winning an Olympic medal.</p>
        <p>Here at the Sydney Games, other former citizens of the Soviet Union have mounted the medal stand for adopted countries. Lenny Krayzelburg, swimming for the United States. Tatyana Grigorieva, pole-vaulting for Australia. For Russians and other immigrants in Israel from the former Soviet republics, there is more at stake. There is the court of public opinion, the issue of whether they have come to pursue individual glory, or autonomy as Jews.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, Israel had a weight lifter by way of Siberia, who, it turned out, wasn't Jewish, and had married a prostitute in order to compete at the Atlanta Games, a member of the Israeli delegation said. When the Olympics were finished, so was the weight lifter's life in Israel. It was an extreme case, but it contributed to the growing concern about athletes from abroad.</p>
        <p>Those who come for the right reasons naturally feel enormous pressure to excel for a country that has won three medals (a silver and a bronze in judo in 1992 and a bronze in sailing in 1996) in its entire Olympic history. Larissa Peisakhovitch, who competed for Russia at the Atlanta Olympics before immigrating to Israel three years ago, failed to advance yesterday in her women's K2 semifinal heat with Lior Carmi, a native Israeli. When the race was over, Pesahovic sobbed on the dock, while Carmi sat alongside, consoling her.</p>
        <p>''It is the sports fans' dream to have a gold medal,'' said Muli Epstein, an exercise physiologist with the Wingate Institute, an Israeli national sports center. ''The country has a lot of problems, not many unifying things to be happy about. We have problems with our neighbors, problems between the religious and nonreligious. But the athletes who come can get caught in the middle.''</p>
        <p>Kayaking is far from mainstream sport, but Kolganov has become well known in the last two years after successive first-place finishes at the world championships in the K1 200 meters, a non-Olympic event. How much of a national hero he would be if he won a gold medal, or any medal, might have more to do with politics and religion than with celebrity and skill.</p>
        <p>''Some people may say he's not a true Israeli, but I don't think so,'' said Zur, who was born in San Francisco but was adopted by an Israeli couple and raised on the same kibbutz where Kolganov trains. ''He wasn't a superstar when he came here. I remember him working as a lifeguard at a swimming pool. All his training, all his coaching, all his improvement has come in Israel. He is Israeli.''</p>
        <p>Training while living on the kibbutz, Zur believes, has contributed to Kolganov's rise. ''Everything is done by the group,'' he said. ''He has a place to eat, to sleep. He just trains.''</p>
        <p>Before the Games, Kolganov was offered the chance to appear in a television commercial for the state lottery with other leading athletes by Yael Arad, Israel's first Olympic medalist, in judo. No, thank you, he said, and paddled off to practice.</p>
        <p>''The Israeli crowd is not so understanding, and that's why I believe he stays quiet,'' Zur said.</p>
        <p>If there is ambivalence regarding Kolganov and the many Russians on the 40-athlete Israeli team, the country's largest ever, there was also a sense of desperation by this weekend. Having come to Sydney with high medal hopes, all of Israel's contenders had failed. There was a close call Thursday, when the women's 470 fleet sailors faded to fourth in the last 200 meters. A pole-vaulting hope, Alexander Averbukh, flopped Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Kolganov's disappointment in the K1 1,000 today was Israel's fifth fourth-place finish of the Games. Had he medaled, it would have come on Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year. That is less a concern back home than how to reconcile the possibility of the first medal for an athlete not Israeli-born.</p>
        <p>He pedaled away from a larger Israeli news media contigent today, without a word, competitor and country down to one race.</p>
        <p>''We just want a medal,'' Rami Zur said. ''Our fingers are crossed.''</p>
