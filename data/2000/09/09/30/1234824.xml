        <p>The nation's largest trash disposal company, Waste Management, was ordered by a city agency yesterday to continue its service to 3,300 businesses in the city to which it had sent termination notices.</p>
        <p>The order came from the Trade Waste Commission, which said it would investigate charges from the customers claiming that Waste Management was violating its contracts with them. Waste Management denies that accusation.</p>
        <p>The order from the Trade Waste Commission came a week after Waste Management, based in Houston, said it would discontinue service to businesses in Queens and Manhattan and on Staten Island that had become unprofitable. Waste Management sent them notice that it would stop picking up trash and recyclable material on Oct. 8.</p>
        <p>Edward T. Ferguson III, the chairman of the Trade Waste Commission, said yesterday that his office had received fewer than 100 complaints from business owners saying that Waste Management's intention to end service violated their trash-hauling contracts. Although some customers have nonbinding verbal agreements, Mr. Ferguson said, others have legally binding contracts lasting up to two years from now.</p>
        <p>Waste Management ''will be required to honor its contracts unless there is some legitimate excuse, and it is no excuse to say they are not making a profit,'' Mr. Ferguson said.</p>
        <p>George McGrath, a spokesman for Waste Management, said yesterday, ''We believe we are within our rights to discontinue service on routes that are not cost-effective.''</p>
        <p>He added that the company would honor all its written contracts that had not expired and that it would review its records to ensure that no customers with written agreements had been notified that their service would end. The customers dropped by the company made up 10 percent of its city clients.</p>
        <p>Waste Management entered the city trash-hauling market in 1996, shortly after the Trade Waste Commission was created as part of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's efforts to root out organized crime in the commercial trash industry. The crackdown was widely regarded as a success, and resulted in a steep decline in hauling costs.</p>
        <p>But the costs for both haulers and their customers have been rising over the last two years, prompting cutbacks in service. Waste Management's move to shed some customers followed a decision earlier this year by the IESI Corporation, based in Haltom City, Tex., to drop 6 percent of its New York City customers.</p>
