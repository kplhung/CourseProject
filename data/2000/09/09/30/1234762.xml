        <p>Even while the outcome of the Yugoslav presidential elections remains uncertain, Montenegro's leaders are sizing up the leading candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, and maneuvering for negotiations over the future of their republic.</p>
        <p>Slobodan Milosevic's departure would not immediately dissolve the differences between Montenegro and Serbia, the two last remaining republics of Yugoslavia. Such a move could herald a realignment in this tiny coastal republic, which largely boycotted the elections, and sharpen the debate over independence.</p>
        <p>President Milo Djukanovic laid out his position today in an interview with the leading daily here, Vijesti, welcoming the success of the Serbian opposition in the election on Sunday and the defeat of Mr. Milosevic's policies. ''I hope there will be change in Serbia, and a healing of relations between Montenegro and Serbia and stability in the region,'' Mr. Djukanovic said.</p>
        <p>Until Mr. Milosevic leaves, Mr. Djukanovic said, the most important thing is to avoid any conflict.</p>
        <p>At a news conference on Thursday, Prime Minister Filip Vujanovic called for Mr. Kostunica to fulfill promises he made in the campaign to redefine the status and relationship of the two republics. In particular, Mr. Vujanovic said, Mr. Kostunica should dissolve the federal Parliament, which is filled just by the pro-Milosevic parties from Montenegro. ''Kostunica has pledged to dissolve the federal Parliament and rectify the damage done to the Constitution,'' he said, referring to changes that Mr. Milosevic pushed through in July.</p>
        <p>In a meeting with the government in Montenegro before the elections, Mr. Kostunica and other leaders of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia agreed to dismiss the Parliament in 18 months. ''We hope it will be even shorter,'' Mr. Vujanovic said.</p>
        <p>The Montenegro government has not had representatives in the Parliament for two years. The government has also been shut out of federal bodies like the National Bank of Yugoslavia and the Supreme Military Council, which oversees the armed forces in war.</p>
        <p>Government ministers said Montenegro had advanced so much in recent years that even a return to the 1992 Yugoslav Constitution was no longer acceptable. They want a new relationship with Serbia based on the platform that they proposed last year to Mr. Milosevic, which he ignored. It is a plan for a very loose confederation, and refers to a union of separate sovereign states, each controlling the troops on its soil but conducting foreign and economic policy together.</p>
        <p>While the platform is a document for negotiation, it is, in the words of a Western diplomat, fairly extravagant and may not go down well in Serbia or Mr. Kostunica, a moderate Serbian nationalist and a lawyer. Mr. Kostunica showed his annoyance at the Montenegrin government, supposedly his democratic allies, for boycotting the elections and thus denying him the extra help of votes from Montenegrins.</p>
        <p>At a rally on Wednesday in Belgrade, he said he had won ''despite some democrats in Serbia and Montenegro who turned their back on us.'' He lumped the Montenegrins together with Vuk Draskovic, an opposition figure who heads the Serbian Renewal Movement and who had refused to back Mr. Kostunica.</p>
        <p>Mr. Djukanovic defended his boycott as a reaction to Mr. Milosevic's constitutional changes, which diminished Montenegro's standing in the federation. ''It was clear we had to boycott,'' he said. ''We were defending Montenegro's most important values.''</p>
        <p>He added that even while boycotting, the Montenegrins gave crucial assistance to the opposition on Sunday, supplying observers to monitor the vote and preventing large-scale fraud in Montenegro.</p>
        <p>Government aides said the Democratic Opposition of Serbia and the Montenegrin leadership had been in close contact over the election results.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Kostunica has also reportedly made overtures to the main Montenegrin opposition leader, Predrag Bulatovic, vice president of the Socialist People's Party, which supported Mr. Milosevic in the election. Mr. Bulatovic's party now commands all but one of the Montenegrin seats in the federal Parliament and is the largest party in the lower Chamber of Citizens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bulatovic, who commands considerable respect and popularity in Montenegro, said that he had not had any contacts with Mr. Kostunica but that he had also distanced himself from Mr. Milosevic since the election.</p>
        <p>''We are a party with our own program,'' he said in an interview. ''We are not tied to anyone. Milosevic is not written into our manifesto. We are fighting for equality of Serbia and Montenegro within a Yugoslav Federation, and everyone who respects this can be with us.''</p>
        <p>One sign of Mr. Bulatovic's influence is in press reports that Mr. Kostunica may offer him the post of federal prime minister. He may find in him an easier negotiator on Montenegro's future than Mr. Djukanovic. As if hinting at his greater flexibility, Mr. Bulatovic said this week that he saw no reason to change the Constitution as it stands.</p>
        <p>The Montenegrin government retains the one strong piece of leverage, a call for an independence referendum. But divisions exist even on that issue.</p>
        <p>''You will see a huge shuffle here,'' a minister said. ''Take away Mr. Milosevic, and then we will quarrel about many things.''</p>
