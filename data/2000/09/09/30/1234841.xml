        <p>For all the concern over campaign finance reform and rich businessmen buying elections, the sobering reality for wealthy candidates is that they are no more successful than anyone else.  From 1990 to 1998, 38 non-incumbents spent more than $1 million of their own money running for the United States Senate, and 32 of them ultimately lost.</p>
        <p>As the biggest spender of them all -- $50 million and counting -- Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for Senate from New Jersey, is providing a vivid glimpse of what money can and cannot do for rookie politicians. So far, in his first race for public office, he has insulted a quarter of the state's voters with an offensive joke about Italian-Americans, concealed a donation to a group of black ministers who later endorsed him, and allowed persistent questions about his tax returns and charitable giving to turn his money into a liability as well as a strength.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Corzine, a former investment banker worth $400 million, has been as prone to missteps as anyone with what political consultants like to call ''rich man's disease,'' he has skillfully managed to avoid the disastrous strategic mistakes that have sunk many of his affluent peers. He has also been extremely fortunate. He faced an unpopular former governor, Jim Florio, in the Democratic primary. He faces a little-known, underfinanced Republican congressman, Bob Franks, in November. And he is running in a state that has been particularly kind to wealthy candidates with bottomless budgets; indeed, he is trying to replace Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a millionaire who won a Senate seat in his first political race.</p>
        <p>But in addition to his ability to spend his opponent into oblivion, Mr. Corzine appears to have learned important lessons that were lost on some of the more extravagant failures of the past, most notably Michael Huffington and Al Checchi, Californians who squandered nearly $70 million between them on fruitless races for senator and governor.</p>
        <p>Of course, no two millionaire candidates are exactly alike, and they fail for different reasons. Mark Warner, a former Virginia State Democratic chairman with grass-roots support and more than $10 million of his own, may have erred only by challenging a popular senator, John Warner, in 1996, a year that favored incumbents. And some of them win, like Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, who had gained popularity as the man who kept the National Basketball Association's Milwaukee Bucks from leaving town.</p>
        <p>In his first few months after announcing his interest in the Senate race last year, Mr. Corzine quickly grew tired of hearing Mr. Checchi's name thrown around as a cautionary tale, his aides have said. But there was good reason. Mr. Checchi, the former chairman of Northwest Airlines, jumped into the 1998 California governor's race as a Democrat and burned through $38.9 million of his own money before placing a distant second in a three-way primary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, too, vowed to spend whatever it took to win his race. He also hired Mr. Checchi's media adviser, Bob Shrum, and his polling firm, Penn, Schoen &amp; Berland Associates, though both had been widely criticized for their work and their fees in the Checchi race. They seem to have learned from the experience, because Mr. Corzine has repeated few of Mr. Checchi's mistakes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Checchi ran at first as a centrist -- his early ads did not even identify him as a Democrat -- defying conventional wisdom that says Democratic primary voters tend to be more liberal. He started his television campaign six months before the primary, and began it not by introducing himself softly, but by trumpeting his business success and declaring his stands on the issues.</p>
        <p>''There were two different campaigns that could've been run,'' said Darry Sragow, Mr. Checchi's campaign manager. ''One was to say, 'I'm successful, I'm great, I want to be governor.' The other was to say, 'I'm a living testament to the American dream, and I'm running for office because I want every kid growing up in California to have the same opportunities.'</p>
        <p>''That last one would've been very complex,'' Mr. Sragow added, ''but it would've been successful.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine has done the exact opposite of Mr. Checchi. He ran as an unabashed liberal in the Democratic primary and has barely moved toward the center this fall. His television ads last spring began with gauzy autobiographical messages about his bootstraps rise from Illinois farmer's son to the head of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company. And at every step,  Mr. Corzine humbly acknowledges how he benefited from good public schools and cheap tuition at an affordable state university. ''America helped make me who I am,'' he said in a radio commercial broadcast today. ''Now I want to extend America's promise to everyone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Checchi faced two other Democrats in the 1998 primary: Jane Harman, a congresswoman who spent $16.3 million of her own, and Gray Davis, a veteran politician who ultimately was elected governor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Harman's pollster, Fred Yang, and her campaign manager, Kam Kuwata, both recalled Mr. Checchi's television ads as lacking a coherent, consistent theme. ''They were all over the board,'' Mr. Kuwata said. ''That's the problem, when you have so much money. You yield to temptation. Whereas when you have a more limited budget, you can't afford to.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's twofold message, hammered home in wave after wave of direct-mail ads and a blizzard of television commercials, is no less poll-driven. But it is focused, and it is consistent: Education. Health care. Gun control. Again and again.</p>
        <p>Even his attack commercials seem pressed from one mold.</p>
        <p>Jennifer A. Steen, an assistant professor of political science at Boston College who has studied self-financed candidates and their campaigns, cites several reasons that the candidates often lost. Millionaires  like Mr. Huffington, Mr. Checchi and Charles Owen, a Kentucky entrepreneur who lost races for Congress in 1994 and Senate in 1998, often rely too heavily on advertising, she said. As a result, they fail to meet, inspire and cultivate the party stalwarts, community group leaders, committee members and others who can marshal foot soldiers for the crucial get-out-the-vote phase of an election.</p>
        <p>''You have to have an air war and  a ground campaign,'' Ms. Steen said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine appears to have grasped that. Early on, he bought up the support of much of the state's Democratic Party in a courtship lubricated with more than $650,000 in political contributions. The payoff was a Primary Day get-out-the-vote effort planned and executed for about $4 million, which delivered record-breaking turnouts in key counties and precincts.</p>
        <p>At times, of course, little can be done to protect wealthy candidates from themselves. Mr. Checchi's visit to a San Francisco newspaper's editorial board became a disaster when he snorted at the notion of sending his own children to public schools. Mr. Huffington, who campaigned for tougher immigration laws, was revealed to have employed an illegal immigrant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's flubs have had less to do with the issues on which he is campaigning, but they have been abundant, and embarrassing. After admitting he slurred Italian-Americans, he made matters worse the next day, before a roomful of cameras, by recanting his admission even as he apologized. After he revealed he had given $25,000 to a group of black ministers who later endorsed him -- and had concealed the donation when asked -- he made matters worse by defending himself with hairsplitting and misstatements.</p>
        <p>''By definition, these guys are not slick career politicians who have a practiced answer for every question and can always figure out their way around every bend in the road,'' said Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster who worked for Mr. Lautenberg in 1988, Ms. Feinstein in 1992 and Mr. Davis in 1998. ''Voters understand that. They'll forgive them a few mistakes. But if Corzine gets to the point where people think that he might be a fish out of water, that he might be in the wrong venue, then people might wonder why he's doing this.''</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen whether Mr. Franks will be able to make enough of Mr. Corzine's mistakes to convince New Jerseyans that he is unworthy of or unready for a Senate seat. Polls show Mr. Corzine with a lead in the high single digits, indicating that he is clearly ahead but in a competitive race.</p>
        <p>New Jersey, to Mr. Corzine's good fortune, is a very forgiving place. Because the state has no dominant newspaper and no major television station of its own, none of his stumbles have yet bubbled up into the kind of full-blown crisis that captures attention and can sink a candidacy.</p>
        <p>A crowded political season and Mr. Franks's fund-raising problems also favor Mr. Corzine. Mr. Franks has yet to broadcast any television commercials this fall and is struggling to come close to raising the $6 million he says he needs.</p>
        <p>''This is the classic state where having the huge money advantage, and having your opponent frozen out of TV, is death to that opponent,'' Mr. Maslin said. ''Yeah, there's coverage in the papers. But it's dwarfed by the Olympics, the presidential race, the Hillary-Lazio race, the Pennsylvania Senate race and the World Series.''</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Franks can raise enough money to mount an effective, last-ditch television offensive building on criticism of Mr. Corzine in the newspapers, Mr. Sragow warned that it would not be enough merely to sully Mr. Corzine's image. ''Voters' expectations of politicians at this point are so low,'' he said, ''that if you get up on a stump and scream, 'Corzine's dishonest,' voters are going to say, 'So what?' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sragow said Mr. Corzine still could be vulnerable if voters perceive him as wobbly under fire. ''Thinking on your feet probably counts a lot for someone running for the Senate,'' he said. But he added that Mr. Corzine's campaign would probably respond by increasingly shielding him from reporters.</p>
        <p>Where Mr. Franks has gotten the most traction lately is by beginning to argue that Mr. Corzine is not up to the job of senator. ''There is a sense among the electorate that Jon Corzine isn't ready for prime time,'' said Charlie Smith, Mr. Franks's campaign manager. ''He's unprepared, and he's out of touch. And he will never have enough advertising to convince the voters of New Jersey that he best represents them.''</p>
        <p>Still, the ultimate advantage of money is that it can erase mistakes,  and for now, Mr. Corzine is the only candidate who can do that.</p>
        <p>''In many ways, campaigns are about who pays the most for the mistakes that they make,'' said Mr. Kuwata, the consultant who helped beat both Mr. Huffington and Mr. Checchi. ''When you have money, you can always make more mistakes, because you have options.''</p>
