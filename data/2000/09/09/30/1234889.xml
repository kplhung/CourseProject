        <p>He may not have earned a spot on the Islanders' roster -- yet. But the rookie Taylor Pyatt has earned himself a long, hard look.</p>
        <p>With a week remaining until the start of the regular season, Pyatt, 19, is the lone skater with no N.H.L. experience still left in the Islanders' training camp.</p>
        <p>The top prospects Branislav Mezei and Juraj Kolnick are long gone.</p>
        <p>Goaltender Rick DiPietro has been sent to the Chicago Wolves of the International Hockey League. On Tuesday, Raffi Torres, a left wing, was sent back to juniors, where he will play with the Brampton Battalion of the Ontario Hockey League.</p>
        <p>And Pyatt, the son of the former N.H.L. player Nelson Pyatt, is still here.</p>
        <p>''He's earned himself the opportunity to get a longer look,'' Coach Butch Goring said of Taylor Pyatt, the Islanders' second pick in the first round of the 1999 entry draft. ''Lucky for him he's a left-hander. This is his big chance to see if he's earned it. We're not looking for 19-year-olds to carry this team.''</p>
        <p>But the Islanders are looking closely at Pyatt. At 6 feet 4 inches, 220 pounds, Pyatt is built along the lines of a power forward, although he is not known for being a tremendously physical player.</p>
        <p>He is, however, a tremendous skater who can move like a a much smaller player.</p>
