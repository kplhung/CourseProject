        <p>In a trendy stretch of town called Buckhead, the seemingly frivolous business of clubbing and cruising has turned into a matter of civic soul-searching, revealing how easily the city's delicate fabric of race relations can tear.</p>
        <p>The focus of the tension is Peachtree Road, the main thoroughfare cutting through a largely white enclave of grand houses and million-dollar condominiums.</p>
        <p>Until recently, the Village, as the section of Buckhead is known, was a largely white scene. But in recent years, frustrated by the dearth of clubs and bars in their own neighborhoods, Atlanta's affluent young blacks, a growing community, have been drawn to Buckhead spots.</p>
        <p>And lately, the Buckhead revelry  has drawn the ire of some residents, which in turn has drawn accusations of racism. Civic groups have tried to roll back closing hours to 2 a.m. from 4 a.m., and pressed the police to enforce laws against cruising, loud music and other infractions.</p>
        <p>Well after midnight one recent Sunday morning, the Village throbbed with the beats of rappers like Juvenile and Lil' Kim. Girls in platform shoes and belly-baring tops walked, giggling, on the sidewalks as young men, cruising in cars, shouted  affectionately through sunroofs.</p>
        <p>Black and white youths lined up in front of the dozens of clubs in this tight, four-block enclave. At some  more upscale establishments, thirtysomethings in suits clinked martini glasses as they hunted for marriage prospects and business cards.</p>
        <p>Shayla Shaw, 21, complained about watching the police excuse white youths for driving erratically, playing loud music and yelling on the same streets.</p>
        <p>''If it was one of us, we would be stopped,'' said Ms. Shaw, who is black, holding a perfumed cigarette between jeweled and manicured fingers at Justin's, an upscale Buckhead restaurant. ''This has been an area strictly for them.''</p>
        <p>The Buckhead residents' most recent campaign followed the fatal stabbings of two men after a Super Bowl party in January attended by the Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis at the Cobalt Lounge, a popular night spot. Mr. Lewis, who is black, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge; two of his friends were acquitted of murder in June.</p>
        <p>Four killings have occurred in the Village this year. Earlier this month, a white police officer clashed with a black woman who the officer said was playing her car stereo too loud. In a fight each accused the other of starting, the woman suffered a fractured eye socket. And charges of racial profiling exploded.</p>
        <p>Black civil rights groups have vowed to investigate the charges. Mayor Bill Campbell, who is black and has been accused by white Buckhead residents of being unresponsive, has appointed a panel to look at race relations. And on the question of when to close the bars, the City Council voted recently along racial lines: Its eight black members voted against closing the bars early; the seven whites voted in favor.</p>
        <p>The leaders of the campaign to reduce crime, noise and traffic, most of them white, deny that race is behind the drive. ''It's been an ongoing effort to tame the night life,'' insisted Sam Massell, the white former Atlanta mayor who heads the Buckhead Coalition, an umbrella group behind the efforts. ''People that call me and tell me about noise at 3 o'clock in the morning a mile from the bars have no idea if the noise is coming from a black or a white.''</p>
        <p>That disagreement is a barometer of black-white relations in Atlanta, which the 1990 census records as about two-thirds black and one-third white. Having promoted itself as a cosmopolitan hub where blacks and whites get along, and get rich, better than anywhere else in the South, Atlanta, some here say, is finding that its favorite slogan -- ''too busy to hate'' -- is more cliche than truth.</p>
        <p>''This Buckhead incident is a microcosm of the very fragile race relations that exist in Atlanta as well as the rest of the country,'' said Robert Bullard, a professor of sociology at Clark Atlanta University. ''We are a very divided city, segregated along race and class lines,'' he said. ''Because of this myth -- 'too busy to hate' -- somehow we have not dealt with it face on.''</p>
        <p>The Village has long been a boisterous, crowded entertainment district. In recent years, a few older black professionals joined the scene. Clubs began promoting ''urban'' nights -- playing hip-hop, rhythm and blues and occasionally Latin music. Buckhead today not only draws a more mixed crowd but a younger crowd, whose members frequent the 18-and-over clubs, or simply cruise Peachtree until the dawn.</p>
        <p>Some blacks say that the influx of teenagers is the problem and that it could be solved by enforcing curfew laws. Some are convinced of racial profiling by the police, while others insist that does not happen with Atlanta's racially mixed force. And some believe the uproar reflects discomfort with large groups of young hip-hop fans.</p>
        <p>Miss Shaw and Carmen Bryant, also 21 and black and nursing a drink at Justin's, offered another perspective. They noticed that white youths who were acting boisterous were not being harassed by the police. But they also acknowledged their own dislike of some black youths. Once, Ms. Bryant recalled, a young black man stepped out of a car and started chatting with her. Within minutes, a young black woman, apparently his girlfriend, stepped up, eager to fight.  ''She didn't belong there,'' Ms. Bryant said, laughing.</p>
        <p>Nor is white opinion all the same. Some Buckhead residents, even those who live within a mile of the bars, said neither noise nor trouble usually spilled onto their streets. Others simply object to every issue being viewed through the lens of race. ''You're always tiptoeing,'' complained Dave Ehlert, a white Buckhead resident. ''If you criticize someone who is black, you're always open to that charge.''</p>
        <p>Kasim Reed, a black state assemblyman who represents largely black south Atlanta, said race was only part of the story of Buckhead. It was also about Atlanta's transformation, he said, from a small Southern city to a swiftly growing all-night destination for young people of all backgrounds. ''We're going through growing pains,'' Mr. Reed said. ''Not only is it happening, it's happening with a diverse group of people.''</p>
