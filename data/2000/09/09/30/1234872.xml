        <p>The Chengde Dixian Textile Company, the first privately owned Chinese company to sell shares to foreigners, gained 30 percent from its offering price on its first day of trading. Few of China's privately owned companies have been allowed to go public, and most have little access to capital. Many people see Dixian's share sale as a symbolic step toward broader government support for the private sector. Dixian sold $25.6 million worth of Class B shares, which are designated for foreign investors and are officially off-limits to Chinese citizens.</p>
