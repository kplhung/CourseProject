        <p>Natalie Ferrol spoke of the humiliation of a friend, a frightened young woman who went to have an abortion, but first had to walk past the pickets and protesters outside a clinic.</p>
        <p>''It was horrible,'' said Ms. Ferrol, a 22-year-old college student. ''She looked around, and worried that she would see somebody she knew.''</p>
        <p>The availability of an abortion-inducing drug, Ms. Ferrol believes, would have spared her friend the nightmare.</p>
        <p>''This way you go to a doctor, and nobody knows why you're there,'' Ms. Ferrol said. ''It's just the doctor and the patient -- nobody else's business.''</p>
        <p>In the view of many people in this north-central Illinois college town, abortion is bound to become a much more private matter, now that the abortion-inducing drug, mifepristone, or RU-486, has won approval of the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
        <p>On the merits of the pill itself, however, there was scarcely consensus. Perhaps most striking, judging from two dozen interviews, was the number of people who strongly support legal abortion, but feel uneasy about the apparent simplicity of taking pills.</p>
        <p>''I'm pro-choice, but this just doesn't sit well with me,'' said Kathy Bresson, a 53-year-old secretary, who was waiting for a bus on the campus of Northern Illinois University. ''Taking a pill seems too easy, as if getting an abortion is no different than treating a headache.''</p>
        <p>People who oppose abortion tended to see the approval of the pill as a sign that American culture was becoming blase about the issue, and that the number of abortions would increase.</p>
        <p>''People won't have to think it through as much,'' said Kristie Beitler, a 21-year-old student who is against abortions but believes the procedure should be legal. ''They'll just be able to take a pill. It seems obvious. I mean, if I was going to get an abortion, this would certainly be the way to do it.''</p>
        <p>Others scoffed at the notion that women would take lightly the decision to have an abortion, with or without the pill. A woman who opts for a drug-induced abortion first takes mifepristone, which blocks the action of a hormone required to maintain pregnancy, then 36 to 48 hours later takes a second drug, misoprostol, which makes the uterus contract, expelling the fetal tissue.</p>
        <p>''Nobody has an easy time deciding whether to have an abortion,'' said Gigi Beaird, 26. ''It's not like something that people want. It's just that sometimes, it's simply the best decision.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''Taking a pill seems a lot better way to go than having an invasive surgical procedure, and it's probably going to be cheaper, too.''</p>
        <p>To Iun Kirimania, a 20-year-old student from Kenya, the pill would likely take pressure off physicians who aid women in ending a pregnancy.</p>
        <p>''It seems that doctors who perform abortions here really have a rough time,'' she said, referring to violence at abortion clinics. ''Now the anti-abortion people won't be so sure who to target.''</p>
        <p>David Woodsmall, a 22-year-old radio repairman, said he believed it only made good sense to give women more options.</p>
        <p>''Since it's legal, shouldn't we give women their choice of how to do it?'' he said. ''In a perfect world, we wouldn't need abortion. We wouldn't need a lot of things. But it's not a perfect world.''</p>
        <p>To Stephanie Surber, a 20-year-old student, the emergence of the pill will mean women being harmed by making hasty decisions.</p>
        <p>''I have a friend who had an abortion, and now she's going to a counseler, because she's got so much guilt,'' she said. ''If you're going to make it so that people can make a snap decision, then I'm afraid a lot of women are going to make choices that they're going to regret for the rest of their lives.''</p>
        <p>To Krystal Curda, a 22-year-old student, the issue should scarcely be debated at all.</p>
        <p>''When you walk into your doctor's office, nobody needs to know why you're there,'' she said. ''Hopefully, this is going to take a medical issue off of the public view.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''Women don't come to this decision lightly. And when they do, they don't need to be harassed.''</p>
        <p>A similar view was expressed by Christine Backus, a 22-year-old college student who added that concerns about rash decision-making smack of sexism.</p>
        <p>''I personally would never have an abortion,'' said Ms. Backus, sitting in a restaurant with her 2-year-old son, Trevor. ''But who am I to tell somebody else to do something? How can anyone say some woman can't be trusted to make a decision for herself? That's ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''I know it's a pill, but trust me, nobody is going to think it's like taking an aspirin.''</p>
