        <p>Gov. George W. Bush outlined a wide-ranging energy plan today that called for more domestic fuel production, better relations with foreign oil suppliers and opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling, all of which he framed as potential remedies for rising oil and gas prices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said the plan, which also included incentives for developing alternative energy sources and clean-burning fuels, reflected his determination to limit the country's vulnerability to the international oil market and to avert escalating prices and energy shortages.</p>
        <p>But it also gave Mr. Bush, the Texas governor, an opportunity to attack Vice President Al Gore on the heels of Mr. Gore's call last week for the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Mr. Bush characterized this step, which President Clinton indeed took, as proof of how shortsighted the Clinton administration had been.</p>
        <p>''They have had seven and a half years to develop a sound energy policy,'' Mr. Bush said. ''They have had every chance to avoid the situation that confronts us today. And now they have nothing but excuses, bad ideas and -- as the clock runs out -- one last ploy.''</p>
        <p>In a sign of the issue's sudden potency, Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, rearranged their schedules so they could deliver their own remarks on energy and the environment. Both said Mr. Bush's plans for the Arctic refuge would cause irreversible environmental damage. [Page A13.]</p>
        <p>The political cross-fire was intense. Mr. Bush, in a speech to workers at a plant here that produces machinery for car manufacturers, cast Mr. Gore as a liberal extremist -- and a slightly loopy one at that. The terms he used were tailored to Michigan, a swing state economically dependent on the automobile industry.</p>
        <p>''The administration seems never to have concerned itself with the domestic energy supply, except to tax, regulate and therefore diminish it,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The vice president likes electric cars -- he just doesn't like making electricity. In speeches, he calls autoworkers his friends. In his book, he declares the engines they make an enemy.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bush had drawn the contours of his positions on energy issues before, he filled them in with new details today, and he put the price of his proposals at $7.1 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>Of Mr. Bush's proposals, the most contentious is the opening of the Arctic refuge, about 19 million acres of wilderness in northeast Alaska that is home to caribou, bears, musk oxen and migratory birds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush specified that he wanted to allow oil exploration in only 8 percent of this federally owned land and insisted it could be done in an environmentally sensitive manner.</p>
        <p>Environmental watchdog organizations vigorously disagreed, and said the polluting effects of drilling would spread wide and far.</p>
        <p>Adam Kalton, the Arctic campaign director of the Alaska Wilderness League, likened the opening of the refuge for oil drilling to ''damming the Grand Canyon for hydroelectric power or capping Old Faithful in Yellowstone for geothermal power.'' And Mr. Kalton said it would not produce a significant amount of oil for American consumers for more than five years.</p>
        <p>While portions of the wildlife preserve are spectacularly beautiful, the coastal plain -- the 1.5 million-acre section along the Beaufort Sea where the drilling would take place -- is flat, largely featureless and frozen much of the year. But to environmentalists, its unspoiled desolation, and its role in the complex ecosystem of the North Slope, argue for leaving it untouched.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also said he would instruct the Department of Energy to identify other federal lands that could be opened to oil and natural gas exploration, which many environmentalists also oppose.</p>
        <p>He did not call for more offshore oil drilling and had previously indicated his opposition to new leases for such drilling along the coasts of Florida and California, two states with many electoral votes and pockets of strong opposition against the practice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush repeatedly alluded today to the administration's move to release 30 million barrels of oil from the strategic reserve, a resource usually seen as a fallback during times of war or major supply disruptions. Mr. Bush called the current release ''a calculated political move'' and noted its timing ''just weeks before an election.''</p>
        <p>But his speech and plan were much broader than that accusation. They criticized what he said was an increasing dependence in this country on foreign oil, forecast rapidly rising demands for energy and delineated a variety of ways to meet those demands.</p>
        <p>''This administration tries to take credit for our economy,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But they seem too have forgotten what makes it run. Even today -- in our new, high-tech economy -- America runs on oil and gas and coal gained from the earth and water held behind our dams.''</p>
        <p>Continuing a weeklong effort to wrest the issue of prosperity from Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush warned that the absence of a comprehensive energy plan, which he said the Clinton administration had never developed, was an invitation to economic gloom.</p>
        <p>''Our nation has had three recessions in the last generation,'' Mr. Bush said, ''and each one was tied to an energy shock.''</p>
        <p>His plan also contained an array of other proposals intended to please a variety of constituencies. Mr. Bush called for an additional $1 billion over 10 years for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps low-income people with their heating and cooling costs. He also called for $1.4 billion over 10 years in additional federal financing for federal and state programs that encourage energy conservation.</p>
        <p>Expressing a concern for clean air, Mr. Bush proposed an investment of $2 billion over 10 years for research into ''clean coal'' technologies; tax credits of $1.4 billion over 10 years for companies that produced electricity from renewable and alternative fuels, and legislation requiring electric utilities to reduce harmful emissions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he would channel the billions of dollars the federal government would receive from the oil companies that went into the Arctic refuge toward land conservation efforts and research into alternative energy resources.</p>
        <p>One advocacy group, Environmental Defense, even while voicing opposition to drilling in the Arctic refuge, praised Mr. Bush for suggesting steps to cut down on pollution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also sought to tailor his plans to the high-tech world. He said  the equipment needed to power the Internet consumes 8 percent of all the electricity produced in the United States, and he pledged to promote the production of more electricity to meet that demand.</p>
        <p>But he also promised to use diplomacy to persuade OPEC to pump more oil and to increase oil imports from other areas of the world. He also called for an annual meeting of the energy ministers of the leading industrialized nations to ''encourage international energy cooperation.''</p>
        <p>Democrats have characterized both Mr. Bush, a former oilman in Texas, and his running mate, Dick Cheney, the former chief executive of the world's largest oil-fields services company, as pawns of the oil industry.</p>
        <p>Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, charged today that portions of Mr. Bush's plan were ''of big oil, by big oil and for big oil.''</p>
        <p>But in an interview today, Mr. Cheney said that his experience in the oil business convinced him that it was possible to explore for oil without harming the environment.</p>
        <p>''For us to fall into the trap that either we develop energy resources or you have a clean environment -- I think is a mistake,'' he said in an interview on Political Points, a Webcast produced by ABC News and The New York Times.</p>
        <p>''One of the things I learned during my time in the private sector over the course of the last several years,'' Mr. Cheney said, ''is that technologies have become very good at allowing us to develop resources that we couldn't have developed a few years ago, in ways that are environmentally safer than they were a few years ago.''</p>
        <p>And part of what Mr. Bush was trying to accomplish today was the portrayal of his and Mr. Cheney's professional backgrounds in a positive light.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush's wife, Laura, introduced him to the crowd in Saginaw, she said that because he had grown up in Midland, Tex., and later worked in the oil business there, he had an especially keen understanding of the energy industry.</p>
        <p>In His Own Words</p>
        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH  Remarks in a speech in Saginaw, Mich., yesterday outlining his energy policy:</p>
        <p>''So America must have an energy policy that plans for the future, but meets the needs of today. Here, as elsewhere, the voters have a clear choice. Here, as elsewhere, the contrast is stark. My plan opens the door to more energy to fuel a growing economy and a new economy. We take the path of exploration and innovation and national self-reliance.</p>
        <p>My opponent takes a different path. In a long Washington career, he has supported higher energy taxes and higher energy prices, more regulation and more central controls. In 1993, my  opponent cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate to raise gasoline taxes.</p>
        <p>He is proud of that vote and everything else he has done to place limits on energy. That year, he wanted an even greater tax -- the so-called B.T.U. tax -- one that his own administration figured would cost the typical consumer $320 a year.</p>
        <p>All this comes from a certain view of the world.</p>
        <p>See, my opponent believes the consumption of energy is the problem and must be discouraged -- by taxes and regulations. It helps explain why he has never made energy production a priority. It is the reason he views American oil producers as adversaries and the automobile as a threat.''</p>
