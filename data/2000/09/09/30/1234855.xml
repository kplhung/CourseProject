        <p>Along drab Kebon Kacang Raya Avenue, where street vendors eke out a living by hawking clove cigarettes and meat kebabs, talk was of little else today but the court decision that set off riots on Thursday with its ruling that former President Suharto was too ill to stand trial on charges of embezzling $590 million.</p>
        <p>''Suharto has done so many horrible things to this country that he does not deserve to go free no matter how bad his health,'' said Nuryaei, 20, who makes about $1.50 a day selling fried vegetables.</p>

        <p>Along drab Kebon Kacang Raya Avenue, where street vendors eke out a living by hawking clove cigarettes and meat kebabs, talk was of little else today but the court decision that set off riots on Thursday with its ruling that former President Suharto was too ill to stand trial on charges of embezzling $590 million.</p>
        <p>''Suharto has done so many horrible things to this country that he does not deserve to go free no matter how bad his health,'' said Nuryaei, 20, who makes about $1.50 a day selling fried vegetables.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nuryaei, who has a primary school education, was familiar with crimes associated with Mr. Suharto's 32-year rule. He cited the killing of 500,000 people in an anti-Communist purge in 1965, the massacre of at least 50 Muslim protesters in the Tanjung Priok district of Jakarta in 1984, the oppression of separatists in the oil-rich province of Aceh, and the 1998 economic crisis that Mr. Nuryaei said was especially hard on ''common people,'' he said, like himself.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying that the judges were corrupt, but there's something about this decision that just doesn't feel right,'' Mr. Nuryaei said. ''Instead of dismissing the case outright, why couldn't they have waited until Suharto's condition improved and then tried him?''</p>
        <p>Though the streets of this capital city of 11 million people were strangely quiet today, Mr. Nuryaei was not alone in his anger and his sense of helplessness and betrayal that Mr. Suharto would not be held accountable for his abuses.</p>
        <p>Across the street from where Mr. Nuryaei worked from his small blue cart, in the Gucci store of the trendy Plaza Indonesia, Dian Supriana also expressed frustration with the court's finding that Mr. Suharto, 79, was medically unfit to stand trial after suffering three strokes.</p>
        <p>''It's too dangerous for me to protest in the street, but I am very upset,'' said Mrs. Supriana, an interior decorator. ''I just don't know what to do about it.''</p>
        <p>Even President Abdurrahman Wahid, who is on a state visit to Brazil, told the state news agency Antara that he thought the verdict was biased and that his government would appeal the decision. Mr. Wahid, who is known for curt comments that he later has difficulty clarifying, said that he had asked the Supreme Court justice to provide judges who were ''clean, determined and cannot be bought'' to adjudicate the appeal.</p>
        <p>''We have been too lenient,'' the news agency quoted Mr. Wahid as saying. ''Even a thief stealing a chicken can end up in jail, but Mr. Suharto was confined only to his own house,'' he said, referring to Mr. Suharto's court-ordered house arrest, which has now been lifted.</p>
        <p>Losing the Suharto case was yet another severe blow to the credibility of Mr. Wahid's government, which also failed to control sectarian violence that has flared in parts of Indonesia.</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Suharto is widely regarded as a dictator who brutally consolidated Indonesia under a single banner, he is also credited with initiating reforms that led to the country's economic awakening, and he is revered here as much as he is despised.</p>
        <p>Still, many Indonesians interviewed today, including some fans of Mr. Suharto, said that they were taken aback by the abrupt ending of the trial. They said the trial itself was desperately needed to establish a new precedent in Indonesia: that no one, including the once all-powerful Suharto, was above the law.</p>
        <p>''I think Suharto did some good things for this nation, but I also think he should have been tried because this country needs to formally acknowledge his mistakes,'' said Chaerudih, 30, who manages a picture frame store. ''How can we raise our children to respect us or our laws if they don't apply to everyone equally?''</p>
        <p>For Martin, a 17-year-old high school student, who was hanging out with friends at the Pasar Baru shopping district, the Suharto case was all about morals and ethics, which he said very few people seem to have anymore in Indonesia. ''We learn about the concept of morality in school, but no where around us do we see it displayed,'' he said. ''None of this makes sense.</p>
        <p>''Suharto commits crimes but cannot be tried for them because he is too old and sick,'' he said. ''So then what happens: student protesters commit more crimes and then the police retaliate and more people die.''</p>
        <p>Albert Hasibuan, head of the Concerned Citizens Movement for State Assets, a government watchdog group, said that most Indonesians are forgiving and would rather move forward than reopen past wounds. But he said that mentality does not apply to Mr. Suharto, who he said was the most important figure in the country's modern history.</p>
        <p>''I think that most Indonesians feel very strongly about this case although they won't participate in violent acts like the student protests,'' Mr. Hasibuan said. ''People are very disappointed because they had high hopes that the case would set a standard for eradicating corruption.''</p>
        <p>The huge shadow that Mr. Suharto cast over practically every aspect of Indonesian society is so dark that it must be firmly eradicated before the country can begin to practice true democracy, Mr. Hasibuan said.</p>
        <p>Warto, a 27-year-old rickshaw taxi driver, said that while he was unfamiliar with the specifics of the Suharto case, he was outraged to learn that the former president may have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. Warto said that he makes about $1.20 a day ferrying people around town in a 12-hour shift. He said he rents the rickshaw for 30 cents a day, and the remainder of his pay goes to care for his wife and baby daughter.</p>
