        <p>In a major defeat for Boeing, Airbus Industrie won an $8.6 billion order today for 25 superjumbo aircraft from Singapore Airlines.</p>
        <p>The airline, whose profitability, service and modern fleet have made it an industry benchmark, said it was placing orders for 10 Airbus A3XX's and was taking an option to buy 15 more. It said it would use the aircraft, which seats 555 passengers, for flights to London, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney, Australia. The first airplanes are expected to be delivered in 2006.</p>

        <p>In a major defeat for Boeing, Airbus Industrie won an $8.6 billion order today for 25 superjumbo aircraft from Singapore Airlines.</p>
        <p>The airline, whose profitability, service and modern fleet have made it an industry benchmark, said it was placing orders for 10 Airbus A3XX's and was taking an option to buy 15 more. It said it would use the aircraft, which seats 555 passengers, for flights to London, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney, Australia. The first airplanes are expected to be delivered in 2006.</p>
        <p>The decision ends months of intense lobbying by the two rival manufacturers and brings Airbus within sight of the orders it needs to justify producing what would be the largest aircraft ever built. The company said it must have 40 to 50 firm orders by the end of the year to make the $11 billion A3XX project feasible.</p>
        <p>Airbus said Singapore Airlines, though only the fourth company to order the new plane, would be the first to operate it.</p>
        <p>''Our decision to be a pioneer for this latest aircraft type is further evidence of S.I.A.'s determination to stay ahead of the field in product and service,'' said the deputy chairman and chief executive of Singapore Airlines, Cheong Choong Kong.</p>
        <p>Because the latest order comes from such an influential airline, it puts pressure on other carriers to consider whether to add the A3XX to their fleets, analysts said.</p>
        <p>''Once someone starts this process, everyone has to follow,'' said Jean-Louis Morisot, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs in Singapore. ''This is an aircraft that allows airlines to completely redefine the airline experience.''</p>
        <p>The order appeared to deliver a rebuke to Boeing, which has derided the new aircraft as unnecessary in an industry striving to become more versatile. Boeing has instead offered a larger version of its 747, the plane whose familiar profile has dominated air travel for the last 30 years.</p>
        <p>In the end, said Airbus's commercial division chief, John J. Leahy, Singapore Airlines was swayed by the chance to own the latest technology. ''The 747 is a very fine airplane, but it's built on 1960's technology,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The message to Boeing was clear, Mr. Leahy said: ''Spend the money, start out with a clean sheet of paper and build yourself a new airplane.''</p>
        <p>But Boeing said it remained committed to its 747X family of airplanes.</p>
        <p>Alan Mulally, the president of Boeing's commercial airplane division, said that the new 747X would be equipped with the latest technology and would be more economical to operate than the A3XX, especially by airlines that already own 747's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulally added that Singapore Airlines was still interested in buying the freighter version of the 747X. The airline is already a major Boeing customer, with more than three dozen 747's and 18 777's in its fleet. Last year it agreed to buy 12 more 777's after Boeing agreed to buy 15 of its older Airbus A340-300's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulally also left open the possibility that Singapore Airlines might eventually buy the passenger version of the 747X despite yesterday's announcement. ''If they want to change their fleet plan, if new news comes out and commitments can't be made, we are going to be there for them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Airbus envisions its A3XX as a flying cruise ship, capable of accommodating bars, restaurants and even a casino. Even with the extravagant options, the company said its new aircraft would be able to fly more people farther for less money than a 747.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leahy said Singapore Airlines had yet to decide just what amenities to put in its A3XX's and was planning to devote years of research to customer preferences.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leahy said each plane was priced at $220 million to $240 million. Singapore Airlines arrived at its $8.6 billion total for the deal by factoring in adjustments for inflation customary in such long-term purchases. But the airline is likely to have received a steep discount from the list price for being one of the first customers for the plane.</p>
        <p>Though the Singapore order does not immediately clinch the A3XX's feasibility, it raises the ante for the airlines' competitors. Though it is by no means one of the world's largest airlines (Alaska Airlines flies more passengers), Singapore Airlines is a leader in the market for international air travel. And despite hailing from a country of less than four million people, the airline has earned a reputation for expanding without something common to most airlines: debt.</p>
        <p>Singapore's flag carrier is sitting on almost $600 million in cash. ''It's got more cash than any other airline,'' said Peter Harbison, managing director of the Center of Asia Pacific Aviation in Sydney.</p>
        <p>Analysts said it was possible the airline could pay for its giant new airplanes without borrowing any money, which gives the airline's endorsement even more impact.</p>
        <p>''A larger aircraft also means a lower operating cost per seat,'' Mr. Cheong said today. ''This confers a competitive advantage to the operator, enabling it to earn higher profits with the same or even more attractive fares.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leahy said Airbus was confident of meeting its sales target. So far, it has won 32 firm orders, including earlier commitments from Air France, Emirates Airlines and the International Lease Finance Corporation, a unit of the American International Group. Other airlines are already seriously considering adding their name to the aircraft's list of future owners, Mr. Leahy said. They include Cathay Pacific, Qantas Airways, Virgin Atlantic, British Airways and Lufthansa.</p>
