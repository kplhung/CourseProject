        <p>At times ''Seven Men From Now,'' the compact and efficient 1956 Budd Boetticher western starring Randolph Scott, plays like a work by  Harold Pinter. Oh, sure, there's the revenge motif that always put the fire in Scott's belly in his collaborations with Boetticher, a series of saddle-bum dramas in which the star looks bronzed and healthy even in a rainstorm in the dead of night.</p>
        <p>Which is how ''Seven,'' a tribute to Mr. Boetticher at the New York Film Festival, starts: the former lawman Ben Stride (Scott) comes upon two men huddled away from the driving rains of the plains. He makes it known to them, in that formidably courtly and unusually accented diction of his, that he happens to be looking for a couple of guys and . . .  well, it's not hard to guess where this scene leads. Perhaps it's why Scott looked so impassive in the westerns  he made with Boetticher. He always set off on a trail that led to the settling of scores, so why waste time cracking a smile?</p>
        <p>The Pinteresque spareness -- when what's being discussed is really not what's on the table at all --  takes place when Masters (Lee Marvin, who was apparently born with gray hair at his temples) insinuates his way through a scene involving Stride and Annie Greer (Gail Russell), the young wife of a tinhorn (Walter Reed) whom Masters dismisses as ''half a man.''</p>
        <p>''Love, that's a mighty fancy word,'' Masters drawls while not so subtly demeaning Greer's masculinity in front of his wife. Eventually, we learn that Stride is out to find the seven men who killed his wife while robbing a Wells Fargo office. Masters joins up with Stride on his vengeance trail so that he can pick up the money the outlaws scored in their robbery.</p>
        <p>Marvin's contemporary sportiveness versus Scott's terse misanthropy is the real undercurrent here. Marvin's well-oiled orneriness -- his sneer was always at the ready -- complements Scott's acid stone face. Scott is so set on fulfilling his quest that he doesn't even seem to be looking at the person he's speaking to; you wonder if he's thinking ahead to the next camera setup. That is, except in his scenes with Marvin, who was more resolute in his squint than Scott, and able to get more out of it. Marvin's sly line readings played like a state of grace in action films; he's one of the best foes that Scott, with his rusting nobility, ever played off.</p>
        <p>The westerns that Scott made with Boetticher -- written by the marksman-plotter Burt Kennedy, who later went on to direct his own westerns -- have a tidy simplicity and brevity. ''Seven'' clocks in at 78 minutes, which today feels like the amount of time theaters seem to devote to trailers before the main attraction begins. If you go into one of the Scott-Boetticher westerns while the sun is out, no doubt you'll be leaving the theater while it's still light outside.</p>
        <p>They liked to work fast, and their economy has a ruthless righteousness. And as they prove in ''Seven Men From Now,'' conciseness has its value -- it's a thrill to watch a filmmaking team that knew exactly what they wanted, and for them, practice made perfect.</p>
        <p>The American Museum of the Moving Image (34-12 36th Street, at 35th Avenue, Astoria, Queens) will present two other Boetticher films, ''Comanche Station'' and ''The Tall T,'' tomorrow starting at 2 P.M. Mr. Boetticher will introduce the films.</p>
        <p>SEVEN MEN FROM NOW  Directed by Budd Boetticher; written by Burt Kennedy, based on his story; director of photography, William H. Clothier; edited by Everett Sutherland; music by Henry Vars; art direction, Leslie Thomas; produced by Andrew V. McLaglen and Robert E. Morrison. Running time: 78 minutes. This film is not rated.
