        <p>The farmers I buy hay from said it wasn't frost, the other morning. I saw them walking across high rocky ground, beyond a barbed wire fence and an old truck body, driving heifers from one pasture into another. Each man carried an old, smooth stick with a wide crook in the end. The elder farmer walked as though he hated cattle -- would like for just one autumn morning to sleep in and not have to wonder what spooked the cows through the fence during the night. He was hunched, sore from what might be Lyme disease or what he calls ''sugar'' -- meaning diabetes -- or just lingering stiffness from the ribs he broke when he fell from a hay wagon in June. He looked cold, as if the frost had gotten into him.</p>
        <p>Except that it wasn't frost, just heavy dew. The barn roof on that dairy farm had turned white, and on my deck at home the wood was grease-slick. But the thermometer had only read 36 degrees overnight. All the cold air had slid downhill into a basin of fog. From my place I could see its limbs, and from the hillside where those two farmers work, I could see the body of the fog slowly dissolving down in the hollow on what would turn out to be a bright fall day, the first day that truly felt like fall. Where moths had tented the tree limbs along the road, it looked as though the fog had torn off in rough shreds as it shouldered downhill toward town.</p>

        <p>Except that it wasn't frost, just heavy dew. The barn roof on that dairy farm had turned white, and on my deck at home the wood was grease-slick. But the thermometer had only read 36 degrees overnight. All the cold air had slid downhill into a basin of fog. From my place I could see its limbs, and from the hillside where those two farmers work, I could see the body of the fog slowly dissolving down in the hollow on what would turn out to be a bright fall day, the first day that truly felt like fall. Where moths had tented the tree limbs along the road, it looked as though the fog had torn off in rough shreds as it shouldered downhill toward town.</p>
        <p>I had driven across the valley at 7:30 and up onto the skyline farm for a load of hay, the fifth or sixth in a week of 14-mile round trips for hay. We'll stack 800 bales in our barn by the time we're done, and the pickup holds 52 bales. Sometimes both farmers stack hay in the truck, and sometimes I take the place of one and climb onto the hay wagon and toss bales down. The running gear creaks as I work my way, kneeling, across the top row of bales. I can smell the smoke from the woodstove that burns year round in the milk room across the barnyard. The emergency-services radio in the coveralls of one of the farmers scratches out an unintelligible phrase from time to time. How an actual emergency sounds is hard to tell. Perhaps the pitch is higher or the unintelligible words run closer together.</p>
        <p>At home, I ease an orange hay elevator -- rusted, battered -- onto the stack in the pickup. It starts with a whine that never lets up, kicking loose hay into the air, throwing dust into the sunlight. The bales catch on the chain-teeth and shudder upward at an angle into the darkness of the mow, where my wife's hands and my father's hands catch them. The horses stand by the barnyard gate and watch philosophically, deeply satisfied with the proceedings. The barn dog lies by the horse trailer and watches too. His house is filled with last year's hay, swept down from the mow when we began stacking a few days ago. We are all bone tired. Real frost will come tonight, and it will bring down the garden, which was doing a good job of bringing itself down already. We should stack wood or lift tomato cages or till ground for next year's garlic. Instead, we will sit in the autumn sunshine and enjoy being bone tired, harvesting our fatigue.</p>
