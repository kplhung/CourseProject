        <p>Federal regulators said today that they had opened a second investigation into Firestone tires, this time involving Steeltex tires used on the largest sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans.</p>
        <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department, said that it had received 169 complaints of problems with the tires, involving 8 crashes, 12 injuries and 2 deaths. The complaints covered many tires on Suburban sport utility vehicles and large vans made by General Motors as well as Excursion sport utility vehicles and F250 and F350 pickup trucks made by Ford.</p>
        <p>Regulators said they had received only two complaints from the beginning of 1998 until the end of July of this year, with the rest of the complaints arriving in the last two months. This would appear to suggest that consumers, lawyers, law enforcement agencies and others have been more willing to raise concerns after the recall on Aug. 9 of 6.5 million Firestone ATX and Wilderness tires that have been blamed in complaints for 101 deaths, most of them in Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>Much remains unclear about the new investigation, however. Regulators said that they did not know how many Steeltex tires had been produced, when or where.</p>
        <p>Safety defect investigations by regulators are common, and many end with no finding of a defect. This is the 40th investigation regulators have opened this year.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., a unit of Bridgestone of Japan, said that it had only learned today of the new investigation. The company said in a statement that it would be ''open and responsive.''</p>
        <p>G.M. and Ford said they would cooperate with the investigation.</p>
        <p>A computer analysis by The New York Times of a federal database covering all fatal automobile crashes in the country from 1991 to 1999 found 26 tire-related deaths in Chevrolet Suburbans and 13 more in the similar GMC Suburbans. There was not one listed in an Excursion, which went on sale last year, or in the F250 and F350, but there were 14 in Ford light trucks for which no model was specified.</p>
        <p>By contrast, there were 93 tire-related deaths in Ford Explorers during this period. The numbers of each kind of vehicle in use is not clear, so the death rates by model are unknown. Ford sold 428,772 Explorers last year, while G.M. sold 183,863 Suburbans. Explorers have been sold since 1990 and Suburbans, in small numbers, since 1936.</p>
        <p>C. Tab Turner, a lawyer in Little Rock, Ark., who is handling many lawsuits against Firestone and Ford, said that Suburbans and Excursions were so much longer than Explorers that they were somewhat less likely to roll over when they lost a tire. It was not clear tonight how many motorists in other vehicles might have been hit by large light trucks having problems with Steeltex tires; regulators often hear less about deaths and injuries in vehicles other than the one in which the defect occurred. The Excursion is the world's largest sport utility, weighing as much as two Jeep Grand Cherokees.</p>
        <p>Ford has put Steeltex tires on 40 percent of its largest, latest pickups and vans and all of the 75,760 Excursions produced so far, said Michael Vaughn, a Ford spokesman. G.M. did not have comparable figures.</p>
        <p>Robert Knoll, an auto consultant who is the retired director of auto testing at Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine, said that people with Steeltex tires should check them promptly. Tires should be inflated to the pressure recommended by the automobile's manufacturer, and should not have any bumps that suggest they are coming apart inside.</p>
        <p>''If you run your hand over the shoulder of the tire and feel steel pieces coming up, you're in trouble,'' Mr. Knoll said. A tire's shoulder is the corner where the tread meets the sidewall.</p>
        <p>There were some parallels today with the tires already recalled. For example, the regulators' written description of the new investigation noted that, ''The majority of the complaints occurred at highway speed and allege a blowout, tread separation or other major failure.''</p>
        <p>The Steeltex tires are all certified to the government's light truck tire standards, which are less stringent than car tire standards. For example, the high-speed driving test prescribed by the regulations is run at a top speed of 80 miles an hour, compared with 85 miles an hour in the car test. Automakers typically run more difficult tests on their own.</p>
        <p>Light trucks, a category that encompasses sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans, have been subject to more lenient safety, air pollution and fuel efficiency standards than cars ever since the United States began regulating vehicles in the late 1960's. Most light trucks in those days were pickups and nearly windowless vans used by small businesses for fairly low-speed driving.</p>
        <p>But light trucks now account for half of all sales of new vehicles, and are bought by families that drive them as fast or faster than cars. Surveys by the auto and insurance industries have found that sport utility vehicle buyers are more likely than the buyers of any other class of vehicles, including sports cars and pickup trucks, to say that they exceed speed limits and shout or make hand gestures at other motorists who get in their way.</p>
        <p>The elimination in 1995 of the national speed limit of 55 miles an hour has resulted in people driving faster, which puts extra strain on tires, particularly if the tires are mounted on heavy vehicles.</p>
        <p>In testimony before Congress about the failures of tires on Ford Explorers, Firestone officials have repeatedly said that they had not understood the significance of the shift in the market from cars to light trucks. They have suggested tougher regulations for light truck tires.</p>
        <p>Current standards for light trucks, ''do not address this vehicle population, a population which has exploded in the past 10 years,'' said John Lampe, Firestone's executive vice president, in testimony about the recalled tires on Sept. 12. ''These issues have been difficult for us. We are not vehicle experts. And these issues may have made it harder for us to see the problems we had and that we now recognize in our tires.''</p>
        <p>The federal investigation is classified as a preliminary examination, the same stage of review that the recalled tires were in from May 2 until Aug. 31, when that investigation was upgraded to an engineering analysis. Regulators are studying both Steeltex R4S and Steeltex AT tires, both of which come in 15, 16 and 16.5-inch sizes.</p>
