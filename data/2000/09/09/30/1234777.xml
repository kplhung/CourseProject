        <p>Vice President Al Gore today sharply criticized his opponent's proposal to open Alaska's protected wilderness to oil drilling, saying it would bring ''decades of environmental damage to reap just a few months of increased oil supply.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore delivered his stinging critique from the wooded 40-acre grounds of the Audubon Naturalist Society, soon after Gov. George W. Bush unveiled a $7.1 billion energy plan in Michigan.</p>
        <p>Eager for a face-off with the Republicans over oil and the environment, Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, changed their schedules today to react to Mr. Bush's plan. Mr. Lieberman even journeyed to Houston, to attack Mr. Bush's environmental record in his home state.</p>
        <p>From a lectern set up in a glade on a glorious fall day, Mr. Gore called the 19-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge one of the nation's ''greatest treasures'' and said that allowing oil drilling on its coastal plain would be ''bad environmental policy and bad energy policy.''</p>
        <p>''The other side now proposes to misuse high oil prices as an excuse to let oil companies invade precious natural treasures like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,'' the vice president said. ''If you entrust me with the presidency, I will not let that happen.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore called the preserve a ''fragile'' area and said, ''It would take years and years of development, which would cause decades of environmental damage, to reap just a few months of increased oil supply. I oppose it.''</p>
        <p>He defended his call last week to use oil from government strategic reserves to try to stabilize oil prices. A day after Mr. Gore made his proposal, President Clinton ordered the release of 30 million barrels of oil, prompting charges from Mr. Bush that the nation's national security was being jeopardized for short-term political gain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who had spoken out against tapping the oil reserve over the winter when oil prices were lower than they are now, defended his recommendation as an example of the kind of leadership needed to be steward of the strong economy.</p>
        <p>''A spike in oil prices can have the potential to set off inflationary pressures, lead to slower growth and impose higher production costs on business,'' he said. ''Strong economic leadership demands swift and decisive action to deal with emerging threats to our prosperity -- even when that action is controversial.''</p>
        <p>He said President Clinton's decision to release the oil had already lowered oil prices about 20 percent, or $6 a barrel. But he also said the nation must cut its dependence on oil.</p>
        <p>''We don't have to build our lives around a fuel source that is distant, uncertain and too easily manipulated,'' said Mr. Gore, who has long been interested in environmental issues. He called for investments in light rail and mass transit, in the development of cleaner cars and in new energy technologies.</p>
        <p>''If we do things right,'' he said, ''if we make responsible choices, if we invest in the job-creating, environment-protecting technology of the future, then we can have cleaner air, more reliable energy and a more prosperous economy all at the same time, with millions of good new jobs for Americans.''</p>
        <p>It was left to Mr. Lieberman to play the attack dog, in Houston's Hartman Park, a ball field in the shadow of the Valero company oil refinery where the air was thick with the smells of industry.</p>
        <p>''To me the refinery behind us represents, unfortunately, what Governor Bush has done for the air and water in the state of Texas,'' the Connecticut senator said. ''No child in America should be forced to play in a park like this with air that is hard to breathe.''</p>
        <p>He pointed to the past ties of Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, to the oil industry, as well as Mr. Cheney's recent attendance at an $8 million fund-raiser that drew oil company executives. And he pointed to Houston's standing as the nation's smog capital. The city had 38 days this year in which smog levels exceeded federal standards, and the Environmental Protection Agency is threatening sanctions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman added, ''I want to ask the American people to ask themselves, 'Does Governor Bush now want to do for America's environment what he's done here in Texas?' ''</p>
