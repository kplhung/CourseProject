        <p>The company that makes the genetically modified corn linked to the recent recall of taco shells agreed with the government yesterday to buy back this year's entire crop to prevent the grain from getting into the food supply.</p>
        <p>The Agriculture Department and the Environmental Protection Agency announced the deal in a joint statement after negotiating with Aventis CropScience, part of Aventis S.A., a big European drug company. The Agriculture Department estimated the entire crop would cost about $90 million to $100 million.</p>
        <p>The Aventis corn, known as StarLink, is approved for use as animal feed but not for human consumption because questions about whether it could cause allergies cannot be definitively answered. Recently, biotechnology opponents reported discovering the StarLink corn in Taco Bell brand taco shells made by Kraft Foods, a subsidiary of Philip Morris. When Kraft confirmed the findings, it recalled millions of the shells, and the Taco Bell restaurant chain also began replacing its shells.</p>
        <p>Susan McAvoy, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department, said buying an entire crop was rare but not unprecedented. A cranberry crop found to have illegal chemical residue was purchased in the 1950's to keep the berries out of circulation.</p>
        <p>Aventis earlier this week said it would suspend sales of StarLink seeds, which means that StarLink will not be grown next year. Yesterday's action seeks to take care of the StarLink corn that is now growing and being harvested. StarLink is grown on about 315,000 acres, or less than 0.5 percent of the nation's corn acreage, making it one of the least popular of the nation's genetically engineered crops.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, the Agriculture Department will actually buy the corn from farmers and then take direct control of the corn's storage and distribution. The corn will not be destroyed but will be sold under government supervision to animal feed lots or for industrial uses such as making ethanol, a gasoline additive.</p>
        <p>Aventis CropScience will reimburse the Agriculture Department but will be able to keep the proceeds from the sale of the corn. So it is unclear what the financial impact will be on Aventis. A spokesman for Aventis CropScience declined to comment on the program's costs.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. and the Agriculture Department called the plan ''a prudent and responsible step.''</p>
