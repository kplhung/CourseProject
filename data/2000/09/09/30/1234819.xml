        <p>Materials used to make the bombs, which were constructed with pipes about 12 inches long, were still being analyzed yesterday by the Police Department's bomb squad, officials said.</p>
        <p>There was no apparent connection between the two cars, which were parked 12 blocks apart, the police said, and detectives said the incidents appeared to be random.</p>
