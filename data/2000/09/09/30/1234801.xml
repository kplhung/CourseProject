        <p>Just four months after he claimed re-election in a vote widely seen as flawed, President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru implored senior Clinton administration officials today to give him the backing necessary to put Peru on a track toward full democracy, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori, who jumped on a plane to Washington this week after making a sudden request to confer with administration officials and the secretary general of the Organization of American States, told officials that he now wants to restore the very democratic institutions he is seen as having undermined during his decade in office.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright appeared to oblige Mr. Fujimori after meeting him, if only by voicing moral support. Her spokesman said she had told Mr. Fujimori he had ''done the right thing'' in announcing plans on Sept. 16 to hold new elections in which he would not be a candidate, and to abolish the National Intelligence Service headed by his disgraced adviser, Vladimiro Montesinos.</p>
        <p>''He really seems determined that this will be his legacy: the return to full democracy in Peru,'' said one American official who met with Mr. Fujimori. ''He knows he's finished, and now the question is, how does he go out?''</p>
        <p>American officials said they were encouraged by the results of a dialogue between government and opposition leaders in Peru. With an official of the Organization of American States standing as mediator, both sides agreed to set a date in October for legislative and presidential elections next year, and to establish a multiparty commission to investigate how public money is spent in political campaigns.</p>
        <p>The panorama has brightened further for Mr. Fujimori this week because Alejandro Toledo, who was the leading opposition candidate for president until this spring, appeared on Thursday to drop his demands that Mr. Fujimori resign immediately and make way for a transitional government until elections can be held.</p>
        <p>''We shouldn't distract from the progress made in the dialogue,'' said Mr. Toledo, who dropped out of the presidential race after a first round, in which he polled about 40 percent of the vote, compared with nearly 50 percent for Mr. Fujimori. Mr. Toledo, who is the best-known opposition leader, has not yet said whether he will run in the new elections.</p>
        <p>But officials at the Organization of American States warned that conditions in Peru remain unstable, particularly because Mr. Montesinos's status remains unresolved. He fled to Panama last week after the broadcast of a videotape that apparently showed him trying to pay a $15,000 bribe to an opposition lawmaker.</p>
        <p>Military leaders loyal to Mr. Montesinos have repeatedly warned of a coup if he is not granted political asylum in Panama, the officials said. Panamanian authorities are studying his request, but so far have granted him only a 30-day tourist visa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori's government has asked for help in keeping Mr. Montesinos out of Peru, said O.A.S. officials, who warned that the spy chief must be made to feel secure in Panama.</p>
        <p>Cesar Gaviria, the O.A.S. secretary general and a former president of Colombia, defended his efforts to find a haven for Mr. Montesinos, who is widely unpopular among Peruvians and notorious among human rights advocates.</p>
        <p>Last week, the senior army officers who support Mr. Montesinos sounded out Mr. Fujimori's vice presidents as to whether they would lead a post-coup government, and used invitations to an armed forces day ceremony to keep the civilian government off balance until Mr. Montesinos had fled over the weekend, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori's invitation to the ceremony was at first withdrawn, which was taken as a threat to his government. The invitation was later reinstated.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Montesinos was a major hurdle for the democratic agenda,'' Mr. Gaviria said. ''This is something nobody can deny in Peru. We believe it's very important to go ahead with this process.''</p>
        <p>American officials, who acknowledge an informal intelligence-sharing relationship with Mr. Montesinos, are ''strongly supportive of the Panamanian government'' for accepting him, according to the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher.</p>
