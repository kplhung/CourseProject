        <p>For the first time this season, the Devils are not including Scott Niedermayer and Jason Arnott as members of the team.</p>
        <p>The Devils trimmed their roster to 23 players yesterday as they assigned 25 players to the Albany River Rats of the American Hockey League.</p>
        <p>Lou Lamoriello indicated that negotiations with Niedermayer and Arnott, who are restricted free agents, have come to a standstill again, even though Niedermayer expressed willingness earlier in the week to settle for less than he was proposing at the start of negotiations.</p>
        <p>''It's like going shopping for a house and you cannot afford to pay more than you have,'' Lamoriello said yesterday. ''I said before training camp what the team can afford and I'm sticking with that.''</p>
        <p>It now appears unlikely that either Niedermayer or Arnott will be with the team on Oct. 6, when the Devils open against Montreal.</p>
        <p>The team will begin the season with six players who were not with them during the playoffs last season.</p>
