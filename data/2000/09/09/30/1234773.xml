        <p>At this time of year, intermarried Jews feel the tug of their traditions, but too often feel there are no religious services accessible to their non-Jewish spouses and to their children.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Little Bad News, a Little Good News'' (Arts &amp; Ideas pages, Sept. 23):</p>
        <p>At this time of year, intermarried Jews feel the tug of their traditions, but too often feel there are no religious services accessible to their non-Jewish spouses and to their children. Outreach by Jewish organizations is excellent, but by its nature, it misses those who wish to balance two traditions and avoid marginalizing one spouse.</p>
        <p>For more than a decade, I have seen involved with a neutral space designed to honor both faiths: the Interfaith Community. Our Jewish High Holy Days services are filled with Jewish-Christian families. Our offerings similarly encourage those who wish to pursue one tradition in depth, while celebrating the distinctiveness and authenticity of each faith and the value of nurturing both traditions in a mixed family.</p>
