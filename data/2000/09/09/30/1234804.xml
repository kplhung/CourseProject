        <p>NOBODY on the Dream Team ever wailed, ''Oh, God, stop this,'' the way Mia Hamm did to inject a note of levity during her team's cry-a-thon yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Dream Team still hasn't lost, although it's getting closer what with the close call last night, but the United States soccer team did lose to its worthy opponent from Norway, which only adds to its luster as the greatest American women's team -- ever.</p>
        <p>On the morning after, they wept and passed the tissue box. This is no cliche about women, no stereotype of female athletes, just a straight reportorial fact. They love each other much more than their silver medals, and they cried when they talked about it.</p>
        <p>They were back at the Nike Center, where they had met their families Thursday night after the crushing 3-2 loss in sudden death to Norway in the Summer Games final, a game that can legitimately be put on a list of great sports events.</p>
        <p>It is always fascinating to watch athletes take defeat. The Boys of Summer, the Brooklyn Dodgers, once lost a baseball playoff game on Oct. 3, 1951, to their own worthy opponents -- only nobody in Brooklyn called the New York Giants exactly that. It took the Dodgers a decade or two to come to grips with what Bobby Thomson had done to them.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was far too soon for the American women to deal with the goal Dagny Mellgren produced in the 102nd minute. There was only time to focus on the big picture.</p>
        <p>''Imagine having Jordan and Bird and Magic and Ewing on the same team,'' said April Heinrichs, the coach with the red eyes. ''We did. For 14 years.''</p>
        <p>Some of them have been together practically since women's soccer was invented. There are children either born or projected, second careers to be pursued. Carla Overbeck, the captain who never got on the field here, noted, ''I am the only one who has said I'm retiring, but it's not like we won't see each other.''</p>
        <p>They were there for each other Thursday night. With their silver medals around their necks, they repaired to the Nike Center in an industrial park.</p>
        <p>''At least my family loves me,'' said Kristine Lilly, one of the old hands. ''They told us how proud they are. We had a chance to reflect. My family had a great time here.''</p>
        <p>Steve and Brenda Mullinix were there for their daughter, Siri. When she was a little girl back in North Carolina, her father would kick soccer balls at a goal in their backyard, or she would bounce on a trampoline, ''where I learned to dive.'' It always felt right having the other side take potshots at her, rather than romping around the field like the Milbretts and Foudys of the world.</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, three balls crossed the line, including the ball that plunked to earth, was kicked and then skimmed the ground, touching her fingertips, skittering into the net.</p>
        <p>''It's hard,'' Mullinix said yesterday. ''Particularly because I got a touch on it. You wonder, did I do everything I could? I think I replayed that last goal 1,000 times last night.''</p>
        <p>And on one of those 1,000 times, did Mullinix stay just a tad closer to home?</p>
        <p>''Some balls get through you,'' Mullinix said. ''You get down. You get a hand on it. You hope you would stop it. But I wouldn't change anything.''</p>
        <p>Heinrichs did not want to talk tough on this day of days, but she hinted at other retirements and allowed as how there were great young athletes in the system. She talked about learning from the energy of Nigeria, the relentlessness of Germany, and the gold-medal status of Norway.</p>
        <p>''It was a great game,'' Heinrichs said. ''If we'd won, it would have been even greater. But the fact that we lost, and I'm considering it was a great game, tells you how great it was.''</p>
        <p>Tiffeny Milbrett, who jumped higher than a 5-foot-2-inch woman is supposed to in scoring the Americans' second goal on a stunning header, used the word ''numb.'' They were operating on little sleep, and no gold medals, and they needed each other. The only trouble was, whenever one would start talking about each other, the box of tissues would start flying.</p>
        <p>Hamm started it, as she often does on the field, her voice catching, her eyes tearing, her nose suddenly red. When she finished talking, she rubbed her face with both hands and the box of tissues came her way.</p>
        <p>They passed the tissues with the generosity and precision of a great team, coach to keeper to defenders to midfielders to forwards and back to the subs. They played like a team. They lost like a team. They cried like a team.</p>
