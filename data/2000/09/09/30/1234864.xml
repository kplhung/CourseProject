        <p>Camille Andia, an office manager for a lighting company, visits the Manhattan Mall on 33rd Street and the Avenue of the Americas almost every day during her lunch hour. The shopping center has seven levels, but Ms. Andia has never traveled above the fourth floor.</p>
        <p>It is not worth the bother, she said. The escalators are not aligned with one another on every floor, so customers have to make time-consuming detours between levels. And the elevators take too long. ''By the time I look for what I'm looking for, get on the checkout line and come back down, it's just too high,'' said Ms. Andia, 49, of Sandy Hook, N.J.</p>

        <p>Camille Andia, an office manager for a lighting company, visits the Manhattan Mall on 33rd Street and the Avenue of the Americas almost every day during her lunch hour. The shopping center has seven levels, but Ms. Andia has never traveled above the fourth floor.</p>
        <p>It is not worth the bother, she said. The escalators are not aligned with one another on every floor, so customers have to make time-consuming detours between levels. And the elevators take too long. ''By the time I look for what I'm looking for, get on the checkout line and come back down, it's just too high,'' said Ms. Andia, 49, of Sandy Hook, N.J.</p>
        <p>Vertical shopping centers like the Manhattan Mall are rare in New York, where time and patience are also scarce and people are more accustomed to the convenience of street-level stores.</p>
        <p>In the 11 years since the mall replaced a Gimbels department store that had stood in Greeley Square for more than seven decades, it has had a lackluster image, with a number of familiar tenants like Foot Locker and Lechters Housewares that are hardly in short supply elsewhere in Manhattan. Many of the 80 or so businesses are cramped, like the tiny Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore on the sixth floor.</p>
        <p>Built around an atrium that can be seen from the elevators, the mall has an 80's look. And it is all business. Unlike suburban shopping malls, it has no movie theaters, live music, special events or places to hang out, apart from a food court on the seventh level.</p>
        <p>But these days, people in the real estate industry predict that the Manhattan Mall -- just like the 34th Street district itself -- will take a trendier turn now that the anchor tenant, a Stern's department store, has announced that it plans to move out in March. ''The effect will be absolutely positive,'' said C. Bradley Mendelson, the executive managing director of Insignia/ESG, a real estate company.</p>
        <p>The shopping center is expected to be reconfigured, with the upper floors being converted into office space and several national retailers taking the place of the single anchor store.</p>
        <p>Mark Teitelbaum, one of the owners of Argent Ventures, a New York real estate company that acquired the Manhattan Mall in 1997 by buying up its debt, said various ideas were being weighed and nothing had been ruled out. ''But right now,'' he said, ''it looks like it would be hard for one retailer to fit in the space, so it will probably be split into multi users, which we think is a good idea.''</p>
        <p>The anchors found in newer shopping centers -- the Costcos and Home Depots -- generally require the kind of cavernous space that the mall does not offer.</p>
        <p>Among the many names being mentioned as suitable tenants are Borders Books and Music, Crate and Barrel, Target, and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, as well as apparel stores like Zara and Banana Republic, which already have stores on 34th Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Teitelbaum said adding offices was an attractive option because there is an intense demand for them. Also under discussion is whether to add a tablecloth restaurant to the food court, now a mix of fast-food kiosks that fills up at lunch time even though it is on the top level.</p>
        <p>He points out, however, that although Argent would like to see the Manhattan Mall do better, by one standard, it is not doing badly. It has annual sales of $650 a square foot, more than double the average for other enclosed malls, $323. Stores on the lower floors like Express, a clothing retailer, and Modell's Sporting Goods are more successful than the shops on the higher levels, Mr. Teitelbaum acknowledged. ''But even our upper levels do more than most,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, retail experts said they expected more from a mall that sits directly on top of half a dozen subway lines and is only a block from Macy's bustling flagship store. With such a choice location, the mall is a missed opportunity, said Robert K. Futterman, the chief executive of Robert K. Futterman &amp; Associates, a retail leasing company. ''They need to target the Macy's customer,'' he said. ''Right now they're getting below the Macy's customer.''</p>
        <p>These days, several prominent retailers are eager to move to the 34th Street corridor, where Gimbels once battled Macy's and other department stores, like Saks-34th Street and Orbach's, were major shopping destinations.</p>
        <p>After a long slump, the shopping strip has made a striking comeback over the last five years and is now attracting established chains like Old Navy and trendy newcomers like Skechers and the soon-to-open H &amp; M clothing store and Sephora, a cosmetics retailer. Iron gates and cluttered windows are giving way to large, brightly lighted displays that draw the attention of passers-by even at night.</p>
        <p>Real estate brokers and retail experts credit the 34th Street Partnership, the local business improvement district, for improving the corridor by cleaning up the sidewalks, adding street lamps and renovating the two small triangle parks in Herald and Greeley Squares.</p>
        <p>With garment factories in the area being replaced by Internet companies, office buildings undergoing renovations and new luxury apartments going up in nearby Chelsea, Argent says the timing is good for attracting more affluent shoppers to the mall. ''The occupants of those apartments will love to have a nice place to shop,'' Mr. Teitelbaum said.</p>
        <p>The departure of Stern's represents an unusual opportunity because it is not very often that 300,000 square feet of Midtown commercial space -- about the size of 30 neighborhood supermarkets -- becomes available. Mr. Teitelbaum said other leases were set to expire soon, creating other vacancies.</p>
        <p>Originally known as A &amp; S Plaza, after Abraham &amp; Straus, its first anchor store, the mall resembles the postmodern hotels designed in Atlanta by John Portman in the late 1960's and copied all over the country. Converting a 1910 department store into a shiny new mall cost $450 million, a price so high that the original developers ultimately defaulted on $175 million worth of debt. From the outset, many people questioned whether a mall could work in an environment like New York.</p>
        <p>After R. H. Macy &amp; Company and Federated Department Stores merged in 1994, Federated dropped  the A &amp; S name. That store, which had been only marginally profitable, was converted into a Stern's. Stern's, which had not had a store in Manhattan since 1969, did little to promote itself, and was hampered by being spread out over eight floors.</p>
        <p>The store seemed a bit fuddy-duddy for Manhattan, real estate brokers said. ''Stern's is a little long in the tooth,'' said Benjamin Fox, the executive vice president of Newmark New Spectrum Retail.</p>
        <p>In announcing that Stern's was closing, Federated acknowledged that the store was unable to bring in enough sales to offset the high cost of operating in that location.</p>
        <p>Shopping at the mall on a recent weekday, Sandra Persaud, a longtime customer, compared Stern's unfavorably with A &amp; S ''At first it was good,'' said Ms. Persaud, a children's nurse who lives in Queens. ''But after a while -- I'm sorry to say so -- I was disappointed. Some of the staff members don't treat you well. You have to wait on line for half an hour or even more.''</p>
        <p>Retail experts say the department store's poor performance was a drag on the other stores, so its departure was no surprise. Argent, the mall's owner, recently bought out the store's lease. ''We've been talking to them about several alternatives,'' Mr. Teitelbaum said. ''It all came together.''</p>
        <p>About a year ago, Argent hired Urban Retail Properties, a company based in Chicago, to manage the mall. The company is known for operating upscale shopping centers, including San Francisco Center and Water Tower Place in Chicago, which have stores like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Brookstone.</p>
        <p>It was not so long ago that another vertical mall in the neighborhood, Herald Center on 34th Street and Broadway, went after the carriage trade.</p>
        <p>Financed by Ferdinand E. Marcos, the president of the Philippines, and his wife, Imelda, Herald Center was built in the early 80's on a site that was once home to Saks, and later to an E. J. Korvette's appliance store.  Early tenants included Charles Jourdan, Alfred Dunhill of London, Ann Taylor and Brookstone, but they did not last long.</p>
        <p>Herald Center, which is wrapped in uninviting dark mirrored glass, was reconceived as a discount mall, with tenants like Toys ''R'' Us, Daffy's and Payless Shoes. The State Department of Motor Vehicles has offices in the building.</p>
        <p>Herald Center will also undergo changes. Six levels of space occupied by Toys ''R'' Us will empty out because the toy retailer is building a much bigger store in Times Square. A retail tenant is being sought for the lower floors, but space on the upper floors may be leased to telecommunications companies, said Joseph L. Jerome, the president of JEMB Realty, which has owned the building since 1989.</p>
        <p>Trying to cater to the wealthy in a place like Herald Square was eventually recognized as a colossal miscalculation. But Mr. Teitelbaum said he did not intend to bring a taste of Madison Avenue to the Herald Square area, as the Marcoses tried to do. ''You won't see a Tiffany's or Hermes,'' he said. ''Our existing customers are people who want good-quality merchandise at a fair price. We want to expand the base we have.''</p>
