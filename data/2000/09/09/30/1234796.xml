        <p>As the MetroStars prepared today for what could be their final game of the season, Lothar Matthaus said he planned to play next year, but no one is saying where he intends to be plying his trade.</p>
        <p>Matthaus, who joined the MetroStars on a one-year contract this year, has provided some of the skills and ability that were  expected. He helped to lift the team from the bottom of the Major League Soccer standings to the league's championship semifinals.</p>
        <p>But he has also provided far more headaches than expected, leaving the question open as to whether he will want to return next season, or, for that matter, if the team will seek to retain his services.</p>
        <p>''I play for sure next year,'' Matthaus said after the team's practice session at Kean College for Game 2 of their semifinal series against the Chicago Fire on Saturday night at Giants Stadium. ''My career is not over. I have only a contract for one season. Next year, I don't know at this moment. I am concentrating on the games against Chicago. I think, I hope, we have two games with Chicago and a final game on the 15th of October. After I can speak for my future.''</p>
        <p>MetroStars Coach Octavio Zambrano said: ''I think Lothar is in a very enviable position that he can choose what his future is going to be. I have no doubt that he will have options to chose from.</p>
        <p>''At the end of the day, whatever we decide, there will definitely be a decision that he would have to make as well.''</p>
        <p>The two sat down for a meeting today after practice, focusing more on the immediate task of changing the fortunes of a team that showed little intensity in a 3-0 loss in Game 1 on Tuesday. But with the 39-year-old Matthaus, there is always more than just the game to consider, which has been the case since his arrival from Germany in March.</p>
        <p>Matthaus has been the center of attention since arriving, speaking bluntly in frustration about the quality of play by the team early in the year, then returning to Germany to play for the national team in the European Cup in June.</p>
        <p>His return to the MetroStars at all was in question after he was photographed in early July relaxing on a St. Tropez beach when he was supposedly rehabilitating an injury. That prompted meetings between Matthaus, Zambrano and General Manager Nick Sakiewicz.</p>
        <p>But Matthaus and Zambrano said those troubles have been put behind them.</p>
        <p>''I only had trouble with the coach and with Nick, only this problem,'' Matthaus said. ''The rest was O.K. This was an important experience for myself. There was only one problem, with the photo in St. Tropez. It was a problem with communication, not between me and the MetroStars, but with the office of the MetroStars. Each day from Europe I made a telephone call to New York.</p>
        <p>''I don't look behind. I look forward.''</p>
        <p>Zambrano added: ''This has been a very odd year. We didn't really have Lothar for a full year. It's really hard to make an evaluation on 16 games, especially when you factor in so many other things. I really believe that his game was impacted by all the things that surrounded him leading up to his retirement from the Bundesliga. There was a lot of commotion that impacted him. It's really hard to gauge from 16 games and all the things that I've just mentioned what his contribution has been or how great or not it has been.</p>
        <p>''I have no problem with Lothar. He's been a good pro. I have no problem with him, personally. All the decisions I make are based on what is best for the team, and that's my first and foremost concern. The only time I think of St. Tropez is when I'm thinking that I'd like to go there.''</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>The MetroStars may be without TAB RAMOS, who strained his groin early in Thursday's practice. Ramos received treatment Friday and said that he would not know his status until game time.''I'm going to have to wait until tomorrow,'' he said. ''I know how much the game means, so if I can play at all I'm going to play.''</p>
