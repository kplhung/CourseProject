        <p>The Federal Aviation Administration reported yesterday that delays at La Guardia Airport in August were more than double what they were during the same period last year, a jump mostly caused not by weather or mechanical problems but because the airport simply has too much traffic.</p>
        <p>August is usually one of the busiest months for air travel, which means delays that month serve as a good gauge for capacity problems at the nation's airports.</p>
        <p>And at La Guardia, officials said, the capacity problem appears to be worsening at an alarming rate. Over the last year, as a result of a federal law intended to expand service between New York and smaller cities by creating more take-off and landing slots for smaller regional carriers, airlines have added as many as 200 flights a day to the airport, which had handled about 1,200 flights on a busy day before the change.</p>
        <p>The airlines had said that in addition to the 200 regional flights, they also might begin as many as 400 more a day under the law. But last week the Port Authority announced that it was temporarily banning new flights during the airport's busiest times, in the morning and evening, because delays had grown to an unacceptable level as a result of the quickly increasing traffic.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Port Authority officials announced that the airlines serving La Guardia had agreed to abide by the moratorium until the two sides, along with the F.A.A. and the federal Department of Transportation, could begin fixing the airport's problems.</p>
        <p>The numbers released yesterday by federal aviation officials display those problems in sharp relief. While the airport had 2,505 delayed flights last August, or about 8 percent of all its flights that month, this August there were 6,654 delays, or about 20 percent of all flights.</p>
        <p>That means that about one in five planes was delayed 15 minutes or more past the time they were supposed to take off. And while precise numbers were not available yesterday, La Guardia officials have said that the length of delays is also growing, as jets often idle for more than an hour on the runway waiting to take off.</p>
        <p>Frank D. Hatfield, the air traffic division manager for the F.A.A. eastern region, said that all three major New York area airports experienced more delays this summer than they did last summer. But this year, La Guardia's delays far surpassed those of Newark, which had long been the nation's leader in flight delays. And the delays at La Guardia that could be attributed to excess volume reached into the quadruple figures -- hitting 1,004 in August -- the first time ever at a New York-area airport.</p>
        <p>In addition, very preliminary figures for September that include flights up to this Wednesday show that volume delays at La Guardia more than doubled -- to 2,091 -- just in the last month. The total number of delays in September through Wednesday was 9,021, according to the preliminary figures, or nearly 29 percent of all flights.</p>
        <p>As an example of how such delays can happen, Mr. Hatfield said that on La Guardia's tentative schedule for October, 10 flights were scheduled to leave and 12 were scheduled to arrive almost at the same time, from 7 to 7:04 p.m. on a typical day. The airport can safely handle only about seven total arrivals and departures at La Guardia during that four-minute period, if the weather and other conditions are perfect.</p>
        <p>''You don't have to be the sharpest knife in the drawer to know that I'm going to have aircrafts left over that I can't accommodate,'' Mr. Hatfield said. Those planes are delayed and then those delays cause other flights to be late, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hatfield added that one figure that struck him was that La Guardia, which is one-tenth the size of Kennedy, has handled more takeoffs and landings than Kennedy has during several months in the last two years.</p>
        <p>He added that because flights must be spaced out in the air at all airports for safety reasons, there was no way to speed up the process of moving planes at La Guardia, which has only two runways, one for arrivals and one for departures. ''We've never shortened the spacing between aircrafts, and that is why people can expect to have more delays,'' Mr. Hatfield said. ''I'm not going to compromise the intervals.''</p>
        <p>The federal law allowing more regional service at La Guardia was the first time in 30 years that the government had eased the rationing of landing and takeoff slots at La Guardia and at Kennedy. The limits had been put in place to prevent the busy airports from becoming overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>Since the change went into effect last year, creating more slots for planes that carry fewer than 71 passengers, airlines have moved aggressively to take advantage of it. The problem is that most had planned to add service in the morning and evening hours, when passengers, especially business travelers, want to fly. But that is also when La Guardia is the most overbooked.</p>
