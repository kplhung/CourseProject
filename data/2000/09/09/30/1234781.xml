        <p>It really was a beautiful thing: presidential candidates making nice to a black woman and meaning it. You don't see that every day in America. But when Oprah calls, even would-be presidents answer.</p>
        <p>Appearing on ''Oprah'' gave George W. Bush and Al Gore the chance to reach out to the oh-so-important-but-only-at-election-time women's vote. Only during campaign season do you hear this many pundits and politicians talking about the ''power of women.'' Especially about the power of black women. Our 15 minutes are here -- we'd better grab them before it's lights out until 2004.</p>
        <p>For candidates, black women are a logical constituency to pursue. Of 2,500 Americans polled from April through July for the Markle Foundation and Oxygen Media, whose programming is aimed at women, black women expressed the highest interest in politics of all the women. Thirty percent said they were ''very interested,'' with 43 percent agreeing with the statement: ''I have a moral responsibility to be involved politically.'' For all women in the survey, conducted by Penn, Schoen and Berland Associates, the comparable figures were 25 percent and 38 percent.</p>
        <p>Because black women are more likely than American women generally to be at the economic and social margins, many have compelling needs to be addressed. In focus groups of black women organized after the survey, participants spoke of the need for schoolbooks without missing pages, health care beyond the emergency room, affordable housing that is habitable and jobs that pay living wages. Indeed, 27 percent of black women surveyed counted the economy and jobs as among the top concerns they want candidates to talk about, compared with 17 percent of white women.</p>
        <p>Some 76 percent of black women also reported their intention to vote, putting them just ahead of white and Hispanic women. And while their turnout in the 1998 elections was about 42 percent -- the same as for voters generally -- that figure may well be in higher in November: According to the Census Bureau, black voters were the only demographic group to defy the trend of declining turnout from 1994 to 1998. The black vote increased in the same period.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore want to capitalize on this, they must focus on developing trust. Only 9 percent of black women in the survey agreed that ''most people who run for office are committed to what they think is right,'' compared with 17 percent for white women and 20 percent of all respondents. Black women also said they see little difference between Republicans and Democrats once they're in office. Come time for governing, they said, compromises too often come at the expense of what is important to black women.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it's those feelings that explain another survey finding: Some 40 percent of black women -- almost twice the portion in any other group (of women or men) -- said they ''prefer a politician who will keep his campaign promises no matter what,'' over one who ''will do what's right for the country, even if it means breaking a campaign promise.''  Asked why in focus groups, black women made it clear that when politicians talk about the ''greater good,'' they usually don't include what's good for black Americans.</p>
        <p>And herein lies part of the reason for black women's considerable interest in politics: We don't have the luxury of ignoring it.</p>
        <p>The message for Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush? Concentrate on a greater good that includes black women. Starting with Oprah is great. Just don't end there.</p>
