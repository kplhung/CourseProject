        <p>They had gone to school together, worked together, traveled together. And in death, with caskets lined up side by side, three of the four St. Vincents Hospital nurses who died in a freak car accident were honored together.</p>
        <p>Nearly 1,600 mourners, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, filled the pews of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan yesterday to pay respects to Mary Ann Going, 60, Kathleen Mollick-Kelly, 63, and Joan Ellen Walsh, 56, who died earlier this week in the accident while vacationing in Virginia Beach.</p>
        <p>The archbishop of New York, Edward M. Egan, was the principal celebrant at the mass and praised the women for their ''selfless dedication.''</p>
        <p>''They cured, and when they couldn't cure, they soothed,'' Archbishop Egan said. ''New York was blessed by the presence of these good and gifted women.''</p>
        <p>The fourth woman, Mary Ann Dono, 60, who also died in the accident, will be honored in a private service at a Brooklyn church tomorrow to accommodate her elderly mother, who is unable to travel far from her Bay Ridge home.</p>
        <p>Because the women had been such close friends, family members had requested that they be honored together in one funeral mass. They asked if the archbishop would preside over the mass and he accepted, according to Mark Ackermann, the senior vice president of corporate affairs at St. Vincents Hospital, who helped organize the service.</p>
        <p>''His excellency reached out to the hospital in support,'' said Mr. Ackermann, who had worked with the women for the past 18 years. ''This was a situation that touched all of New York's hearts, and the archbishop was touched as well.''</p>
        <p>As the caskets were carried into the cathedral, hundreds, some of whom had never met the women, shivered outside in the morning cold to pay their own respects.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ackermann said that as soon as the news of their deaths hit local newspapers, police officers and former patients of the nurses left bouquets of flowers at the hospital's chapel.</p>
        <p>''During their lifetime, they helped many people through difficult times,'' said Mr. Giuliani. ''All four of these women were heroes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani described their deaths as a ''tragedy for the city of New York,'' and thanked the women for treating and caring for the children of New York.</p>
        <p>Ms. Going's brother, James P. Going, who delivered the eulogy, pointed out that while these women helped saved the lives of many children, they never had any of their own.</p>
        <p>''We know you're in heaven looking down, and we hope you're enjoying your send-off,'' Mr. Going said to the women, bringing laughter amid tears.</p>
        <p>The women had worked nearly 36 years together at St. Vincents Hospital in Manhattan as pediatric nurses, caring for sick children. Before working at the hospital, the four had studied together at St. Vincents Nursing School.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dono had managed the pediatric and neonatal intensive care unit and had worked at the hospital since 1960. Ms. Going, who joined the staff a year later, was the unit's nursing care coordinator. Ms. Walsh, who worked at the hospital since 1964, had been the pediatric case manager. Mrs. Mollick-Kelly, the only one of the women to marry, had been the head nurse of the pediatrics and obstetrics outpatient clinic. She was divorced and had worked at the hospital since 1957.</p>
        <p>The four women were killed last Sunday when their 1999 Honda Accord plowed through a concrete wall and fell 41 feet from the top floor of a five-story parking garage next to the hotel where they were staying. The car landed on its roof on a walkway that connects the street to the boardwalk, and although thousands of pedestrians were milling in the area, no one else was injured.</p>
        <p>Virginia Beach police are still investigating the crash, but a preliminary investigation has shown no signs of mechanical problems with the car or alcohol use by the driver.</p>
