        <p>The Politics of the Euro  Denmark's rejection of a single European currency may imperil a plan by Prime Minister Tony Blair to persuade Britons to abandon the pound, and it has undermined Mr. Blair's efforts to cast Britain's euro debate in mainly economic terms.</p>

        <p>Bush Energy Plan Favors More Domestic Exploration  Gov. George W. Bush, saying the Clinton administration has been shortsighted, outlined a broad energy plan that calls for more domestic fuel production, better relations with foreign suppliers and the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling, all of which he framed as potential remedies for rising oil and gas prices. He also offered incentives for developing alternative energy sources and clean-burning fuels.</p>

        <p>Gore Sees Danger in Bush Plan  Vice President Al Gore criticized the Bush proposal to open Alaska's protected wilderness to oil drilling, saying it would bring ''decades of environmental damage to reap just a few months of increased oil supply.''</p>
        <p>A13</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, went to Texas to deliver a blistering assault on Governor Bush's environmental record, depicting Texas as choking in smog and Mr. Bush as bent on ravaging the Alaskan wilderness for oil.</p>

        <p>Dispute on Drug Ad Campaign  The White House is withholding millions of dollars in payments to a major advertising firm, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, because of accusations that the firm may be overbilling the government for its work on a huge media campaign intended to discourage young people from using drugs.</p>

        <p>Ineligible Children to Leave Health Plan for Medicaid  Roughly half of all children in New York State who are enrolled in a special government health care plan do not actually qualify for the plan and will be removed from it in the next several months. The plan, the Children's Health Insurance Program, was intended to insure children from low-income families that could not afford private insurance and made too much money for Medicaid. But thousands of the New York children in the plan should be in Medicaid, officials and experts say.</p>
