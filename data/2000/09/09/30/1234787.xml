        <p>In the fractured city where the old Communist Yugoslavia played host to the 1984 Winter Olympic Games, Bosnia's Serbs, Croats and Muslims are making a different kind of Olympian effort.</p>
        <p>Bosnia has sent a united team of athletes to the Games for the first time since the bloodshed and ethnic cleansing that tore its communities apart. Just as remarkably, the Games are being covered live in Sydney by a multiethnic team of sports commentators, a dash of social engineering that uses television to blunt political and ethnic tension.</p>
        <p>Bosko Budisa, 54, a Bosnian Serb, was recruited from the main network operating in the Serbian sector of Bosnia to be the pool director for the Olympic coverage in Sarajevo, at the largest station of the Muslim-Croat federation that makes up the rest of the country.</p>
        <p>From the control room inside a war-scarred cement building that bears a plaque naming the 39 employees who died in the 1992-1995 siege of Sarajevo, Mr. Budisa supervises six reporters -- two Serbs and four Muslims -- in Sydney and 68 pool producers and technicians -- Muslim, Serb and Croat -- at the station.</p>
        <p>Mr. Budisa, who transferred to a Serbian station when the war broke out, had not been back in the building until this fall. ''It is like Sarajevo in 1984 when we all worked together,'' he said. ''My people are not thinking about each other's ethnic identities. They are focusing totally on their jobs.''</p>
        <p>The 2000 Olympics are being brought to Bosnia by the fledgling Public Broadcasting System, Bosnia's first nationwide public television network since war started in 1992. The station is the latest, most visible effort by the foreign diplomats who have effectively run Bosnia since the 1995 Dayton accords to force ethnic integration back into a still bitterly divided society.</p>
        <p>Bosnia's two main networks, one mainly serving Bosnian Serbs and the other the residents of the Muslim-Croat federation, were forced to run Olympic coverage simultaneously under the station's logo, sharing costs and personnel. But the Olympic package is only the first, and easiest, step.</p>
        <p>In a nation that now has three parliaments, three postal systems, two armies and more than 80 local television stations, the diplomats intend to use the station to create a unified national evening news program that will inform Muslims, Serbs and Croats.</p>
        <p>''It was television and radio propaganda that led Yugoslavia into the war, and quite cynically, I want to use media propaganda to build a democratic, multiethnic Bosnia,'' Wolfgang Petritsch, who heads the international administration in Bosnia, said in his office, a newly erected white building that gleams amid bombed-out cement blocks.</p>
        <p>''I am the final authority for the interpretation of Dayton, so what I say is the law, so to speak,'' said Mr. Petritsch, an Austrian diplomat who has removed dozens of Bosnian officials from office for ''obstructing'' the principles of Dayton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Petritsch hopes to introduce new programming after November parliamentary elections in which he and his diplomats predict that nationalist parties will lose support. He is preparing to fire hundreds of television employees to strip down and reorganize the networks of the two entities that make up Bosnia, obliging them to broadcast an evening news program jointly.</p>
        <p>To sweeten that pill, the fledgling network has signed an exclusive contract with the main European organization that broadcasts international sports events across the world, ensuring that Bosnians who want to watch the World Cup will have to watch its programming to do so.</p>
        <p>The plan is the West's boldest effort yet to depoliticize television news and blur the differences among three ethnic communities.</p>
        <p>The international administration has already moved to dismantle the most flagrantly nationalist television and radio broadcasts. In 1997 NATO peacekeepers tore down the transmitters of the Bosnian Serb television station, and in 1998 an international commission was created to license radio and television throughout Bosnia.</p>
        <p>Some local politicians, accustomed to more easily controlled news media, have expressed resentment over the interference, protesting that the process is too slow and that they are not being consulted.</p>
        <p>''There is a lot of arrogance,'' complained Mirza Hajric, an adviser to Alija Izetbegovic, the chairman of the multiethnic presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. ''All we hear is, 'I, the good Big Brother, will do this.' It is true we need experts from elsewhere, but they cannot do the job for us.''</p>
        <p>Referring to a commercial network started with Western expertise and millions of dollars of American and European funds, and which is faltering now, Mr. Hajric added, ''If Western expertise is so great, why is OBN TV such a failure?''</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Petritsch took over in August of last year, his office has shifted its focus to a public service system. After an initial infusion of about 14.5 million euros -- about $12.75 million at current exchange rates -- in Western funds over two years, it is expected to sustain itself on viewer fees without foreign or state subsidies.</p>
        <p>He has a new media team, with scores of Western advisers hired to reorganize Bosnia's television system, among them Shelley Hack, a former television actress (''Charlie's Angels'') who has worked as a media consultant for American and European diplomats and is now helping Mr. Petritsch mold his Public Broadcasting System.</p>
        <p>''The Olympics help make PBS real,'' she explained. ''I told the sports desks at both networks: 'This is television. We can talk all we want, but reality is what is on TV -- people want to see the Olympics.' ''</p>
        <p>There were not many viewer complaints. A few non-Serbs were irritated by the announcements in Cyrillic letters flashing at the bottom of their screens -- reminders of what they now recall as the Serbian domination of the old Yugoslav days. When a Muslim viewer called in to complain that one Bosnian Serb commentator had referred to volleyball players from neighboring Yugoslavia as ''our team,'' Mr. Budisa reviewed the tape to prove the viewer mistaken.</p>
        <p>In Pale, the ski resort above Sarajevo that Bosnian Serb leaders made their wartime capital, ethnic grievances still fester, and some people there were vexed by what they viewed as a forced neutrality in coverage of their fellow Serbs in Sydney.</p>
        <p>''It's not good,'' complained a technician at a Kanal S, a small, nationalist Bosnian Serb television station. ''You feel their restraint -- they cannot express their sympathy for Yugoslavia. You feel that the reporter is biting his tongue.'' She said a nationwide television network could never work.</p>
        <p>In Sarajevo, most people seemed happy and relieved by the changes. ''We need a unified institution we can trust,'' said Radovan Vignjevic, 54, a lawyer who is on the board of the Serbian Civic Council, a private association. ''We cannot go on having three different interpretations of the same news event.''</p>
        <p>Amir Tajic, 43, a Bosnian Muslim police officer, said much the same thing as he lay in his hospital bed, recovering from heart trouble by watching the Olympic women's high jump competition on a television set he brought from home. ''We need one common truth to be known to everyone,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Whether PBS can transfer its success to news coverage remains to be seen. Rade Budalic, 56, a Serb who works at the Bosnian Croat station, warned: ''Sports is easy. It's a celebration of individual achievement. Politics is essentially about loss.''</p>
