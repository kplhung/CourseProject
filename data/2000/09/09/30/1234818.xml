        <p>Marion Jones stood on the runway, blew air from her cheeks and shook her arms as if she were shivering on this hot, windy night at the Olympics. This was her sixth and final long jump. She crouched and swung her arms, and then she leaned back, hopped slightly and began her final urgent sprint toward history.</p>
        <p>Her form on the runway was awkward as usual, her strides chopped, her technique unreliable. She looked exactly like what she was, a sprinter trying to master the long jump. No other woman possesses her immense speed, however, and when Jones landed with a sandy jolt she was 24 feet from the takeoff board. She had hoped for one big jump and this was it, clearly the longest of the competition. But was it legal?</p>
        <p>Jones turned and hoped to see an official waving a white flag, but it was red and she scrunched her face in the smile that comes with incredulous defeat. Half of her foot had been planted beyond the takeoff board and the jump was a foul, her fourth on sixth attempts. Gone was any chance of becoming the first female track and field athlete to win five gold medals in one Olympics.</p>
        <p>The gold medal went to Heike Drechsler, the former East German champion who was once as versatile as Jones is now. Her winning jump was a modest 22 feet 11 1/4 inches, the shortest to bring Olympic victory since 1984. Having won the long jump for a unified Germany in 1992, Drechsler won again in 1996. At 35, she is the oldest woman to win the Olympic long jump.</p>
        <p>The silver medal went to Fiona May of Italy, who jumped 22-8 1/2. Jones traveled the same distance, but she took the bronze because her next best jump, 21-11, was shorter than May's. For most people, perhaps for everyone but Jones, a pair of gold medals at 100 meters and 200 meters, with two more possible in Saturday's relays, would be a satisfying achievement at an Olympics. Among women, only Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands in 1948 has won four gold medals in track and field at one Olympics.</p>
        <p>But this defeat will linger like a pulled muscle. The winning distance would not even have won a medal at the last three Olympics. Jones has jumped a foot farther; at the Olympic trials, she had jumped 23- 1/2. The gold medal was there for the taking but Jones could not find her timing. Her critics said she had been too proud, stubborn and loyal to seek outside help for her undependable technique.</p>
        <p>''Marion is a great fighter,'' Drechsler said. ''She has so much speed. When she handles the speed in the jump, we have no chance. She is the future. She has to work on the runup. With good rhythm, she can jump very far.''</p>
        <p>Asked if she could consider these Olympics fun, given that her husband, the shot-putter C. J. Hunter, had tested positive for steroids and that her attempt to win five gold medals had failed, Jones said, ''Fun is winning, that's what it comes down to.</p>
        <p>''I'm disappointed in myself,'' she added. ''I felt I let myself down today. I'll be able to look back at this Sydney experience and say it was a good experience, but fun is winning.''</p>
        <p>The United States took an unexpected gold medal in the pole vault tonight -- the first by an American since Bob Seagren in 1968 -- when Nick Hysong of Phoenix set a personal best of 19-4 1/4 and won on fewer misses over his teammate Lawrence Johnson. When the American record-holder, Jeff Hartwig, failed to clear a height at the Olympic trials, few believed the United States had a chance to win any medal in Sydney, much less the gold and silver, which had not been done in 40 years.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people thought Jeff was our only chance, but Lawrence and I came out here with the goal of saying, 'We're out here, we're ready to jump, we can do it too,' '' Hysong said.</p>
        <p>This was not a kind night for expected champions.</p>
        <p>In perhaps one of the biggest upsets of the Olympics, Hicham el-Guerrouj of Morocco lost in the men's 1,500 meters to Kenya's Noah Ngeny in 3:32.07. El-Guerrouj is the world record-holder at 3:26.00, and he had lost only one race since 1996, when he fell at the Atlanta Games just as he was about to take the lead entering the final lap. For four years, he had kept a picture of himself, crying into his hands, as a token of self-flagellation and motivation. This would never happen again. But, essentially, it did.</p>
        <p>Paced by a teammate, el-Guerrouj went through the first 400 meters in 54.14 seconds, running near the front so that he would not be spiked as he had been in an earlier round. Still, something was wrong. El-Guerrouj had been feeling the pressure of redemption, his coach said, and he had hardly slept more than two hours a night in the last week. After one lap, the pace was too fast and he asked his teammate Youssef Baba to slow down, said his coach, Abdelkader Kada.</p>
        <p>The second lap took a minute, and at 800 meters el-Guerrouj moved into the lead. It was a long time to stay in front on a windy evening, especially when he was bothered by a thigh injury. El-Guerrouj could not shake Ngeny, and off the final turn he glanced sideways as the Kenyan prepared to make his move, drawing away in the final 15 meters.</p>
        <p>El-Guerrouj finished second in 3:32.32 and sat on the track in disbelief. Four years ago, King Hassan II of Morocco had phoned him in the Olympic Stadium in Atlanta to comfort him in his inconsolable defeat. Recently, the new king, Mohammed VI, phoned to wish him well, but the expectation of an entire country had been a heavy load to shoulder. El-Guerrouj began sobbing at his postrace news conference.</p>
        <p>''It's very difficult to face this pressure,'' he said. ''Before I got into the stadium, I already started crying.''</p>
        <p>There was pressure in the long jump, too, as Jones struggled through an uncertain season, seldom able to convert her searing speed into a propulsive leap, as Carl Lewis did with such efficiency. She grew defensive earlier in the season when Mike Powell, the world record-holder, and others suggested that she needed refinement in her technique. She stood by her coach, Trevor Graham, a former Jamaican quarter miler, saying she would not abandon him because he had never abandoned her.</p>
        <p>Tonight Jones said she never considered hiring a long-jump coach. Graham said that Powell and others only wanted ''a piece of the pie.'' Tonight Jones never felt comfortable on the runway, Graham said, slowing down one time, then speeding up the next as she attempted futilely to find her rhythm as the wind swirled.</p>
        <p>''I tried to tell her to keep it under control,'' Graham said, ''but it's hard to tell the fastest woman in the world to slow down.''</p>
        <p>Instead, it was Drechsler who possessed the most secure balance of speed and technique. She has been on the top of her game since she first won a world championship in 1983 at age 18. Competing for East Germany at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, Drechsler won a silver medal to Jackie Joyner-Kersee in the long jump and bronzes to Florence Griffith Joyner at 100 meters and 200 meters. Four years later, the outcome was reversed and Drechsler defeated Joyner-Kersee to win the long jump at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.</p>
        <p>''She's powerful; she's still got some speed and she's got the most sound technique,'' said Willie Banks, the former world record-holder in the triple jump and a contemporary of Drechsler's. ''She's quick off the board and holds her position to the landing. Marion's biggest problem is that she doesn't attack the board with force. She uses all speed without technically lifting off the ground. You can see it because she falls forward when she lands.''</p>
        <p>Drechsler had jumped 23-8 1/4 and 23-5 1/4 at those previous Games, results that were far beyond her tonight. Much has changed since Seoul. The Berlin Wall opened in 1989 and, later, so did the secrets about East Germany's state-sponsored system of doping. Five years ago, Drechsler was fined $4,300 for committing perjury regarding a denial of drug accusations made against her in a book by the German author Brigitte Berendonk, a former West German discus thrower.</p>
        <p>Former East German athletes were granted amnesty, however, and were not suspended after the system of doping was uncovered in documents and court cases. Drechsler has never failed a drug test and has become a popular athlete in Germany for her success and perseverance. Tonight she declined to speak about her past, except to say that the German Olympic team felt truly unified even if the country did not yet.</p>
        <p>''The team is really a team; it doesn't feel like East and West,'' Drechsler said. ''It's not so easy for the people, East and West, to have this history in their heads. That will be a generation problem. In the team, I feel we have no distance.''</p>
        <p>Divorced now, Dreschler is the mother of a 10-year-old son named Toni, who prefers the decathlon to the long jump. She thought she might give up the sport last year. After missing the Atlanta Olympics with an injury, she tore a calf muscle a year ago and sat out the 1999 world track and field championships. Because the Sydney Games were only a year away, she decided not to retire.</p>
        <p>''When I was a little girl, I painted pictures of me with a gold medal around my neck,'' Drechsler said. ''The Olympic Games are always special for me. As a child, I always wanted to compete. I was able to win this time. This accomplishment is the greatest at the end of a long career.''</p>
        <p>SYDNEY 2000: TRACK AND FIELD  Correction:  October 1, 2000, Sunday  Because of an editing error, a sports article yesterday about Heike Drechsler's victory in the Olympic women's long jump referred incorrectly to her participation in the 1996 Games. She did not win the event that year, but missed the Games with an injury.</p>
