        <p>Few American orchestras have been so closely associated with their concert halls, and for as long, as the Boston Symphony.

        <p>Few American orchestras have been so closely associated with their concert halls, and for as long, as the Boston Symphony. Its home, Symphony Hall, was built in 1900, in time for the orchestra's 20th season, and this year the orchestra is celebrating the hall's centenary, and by extension, its relationship with an auditorium that has been revered for its warm, enveloping acoustics since the night it opened.</p>
        <p>The celebration includes the publication of two commemorative books and a 10-CD set of broadcast recordings, as well as a plan to renovate the hall, which has just been given national landmark status. No dollar figure has been put on the renovation, and public discussion of what is to be done has been vague. Sprucing up the hall's exterior and social spaces has been mentioned, but although the management is understandably wary of tampering with the hall's acoustics, there is work to be done in the hall itself.</p>
        <p>The stage floor needs replacement, but there is talk of doing that a few boards at a time in the hope of avoiding a dramatic change. The notion of uncovering windows that were filled in during World War II -- for blackout purposes, not acoustical reasons -- is under discussion as well.</p>
        <p>At any rate, the Boston Symphony has learned something from Carnegie Hall: instead of renovating before the centenary, and risking having the celebration marred by worries about what had happened to the acoustics, it is having the party first and doing the maintenance work later. The centenary party, in the form of a ball, a rededication ceremony, a starry gala concert and an open house, takes place in two weeks, in the days leading up to the anniversary of the hall's opening, Oct. 15.</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, though, Seiji Ozawa opened the Boston Symphony's season by revisiting Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, the first work the orchestra played in Symphony Hall. This grand, solemn Mass must have seemed perfectly suited to the occasion in 1900, as it would today, although probably for different reasons. Now an orchestra opening a new hall has reason to pray, solemnly and at length, that it will not be saddled with a white elephant with mediocre acoustics.</p>
        <p>Symphony Hall opened in a different age, when acoustical engineering was still regarded as an art rather than a science and when great halls were being built around the world.  Chances are the Missa Solemnis was chosen in 1900 partly because its rich, regal textures, in which the orchestra, chorus and vocal soloists are tightly interwoven, make it a sublime work with which to consecrate a new hall, and partly because those qualities, along with Beethoven's alternation of thunder and rumination, show off the sound of both the room and the ensemble.</p>
        <p>It still does that. Mr. Ozawa is coming to the end of his tenure as the Boston Symphony's music director, but he has led the orchestra for more than 30 years -- nearly a third of the time it has performed at Symphony Hall -- and he is responsible to a great degree for its current sound. That has not always been for the best. Reports of dispiritedness from within the orchestra go a long way toward explaining any number of tepid performances this reviewer has heard over the last dozen years.</p>
        <p>But on Thursday night Mr. Ozawa was in his element, and the orchestra and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus performed with the vigor, unanimity of purpose and timbral lushness necessary to define the emotional peaks and valleys of Beethoven's great Mass. The choral singing was consistently fine, and the soloists -- Emiko Suga, soprano; Anna Larsson, contralto; Kurt Streit, tenor; and Willard White, bass-baritone -- sang powerfully and persuasively on their own and cohesively as an ensemble.</p>
        <p>There were some truly magical moments. The stabbing Amen chords in the Credo, for example, had a solidity that made them seem explosive. By contrast, the melancholy meditation in the Sanctus had an almost Mahlerian breadth. And at the moment of the performance, it was hard to think of anything lovelier than the section of the Benedictus in which the four vocal soloists blended gorgeously, with Malcolm Lowe's solo violin weaving around them, supported by pizzicato strings.</p>
