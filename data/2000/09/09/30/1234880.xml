        <p>Winning the Tour de France has proven easier than winning an Olympic gold medal for Lance Armstrong.</p>
        <p>Armstrong, the double winner of cycling's great marathon, finally won a Summer Games medal on his fourth attempt today but it was a bronze. He finished behind Viacheslav Ekimov of Russia, the gold medalist, and Jan Ullrich of Germany.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Mari Holden of the United States stunned just about everybody, including herself, by winning a silver medal in the time trial.</p>
        <p>Holden, 29, was second behind Leontien Zijlaard of the Netherlands, and finished ahead of her idol and training companion, the venerable 41-year-old Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli of France.</p>
        <p>Zijlaard won her third gold medal of these Games, having won the road race on Tuesday and setting a world record in individual pursuit. She also won a silver in the points race.</p>
        <p>Armstrong, who turned 29 on Sept. 18, finished 12th in the road race in the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, sixth in the time trial in Atlanta and finished 13th in the road race on Wednesday. He felt his best chance was in the time trial but was beaten not only by Ullrich, who won the road race Wednesday, but also by his U.S. Postal Service teammate from the tour, Ekimov, who normally works in Armstrong's service.</p>
        <p>Ekimov finished in 57 minutes, 40 seconds on the 29.08-mile course, while Ullrich finished in 57:48 and Armstrong finished in 58:14.</p>
        <p>The race came after yet another setback for Armstrong. He had been told that he had testicular cancer in October 1996 and underwent surgery and 12 weeks of chemotherapy. He took a year off and began racing in 1998 and won the Tour de France in 1999 and 2000.</p>
        <p>In August, he was hit by a car while cycling outside Nice, France, and was found to have a fractured vertebra in his neck. But he persevered to come here to pursue his childhood dream.</p>
        <p>''I came here to win the gold,'' Armstrong said after today's race. ''When you prepare, and do your best, you have to say, 'I didn't deserve to win.' ''</p>
        <p>Holden had an almost opposite reaction to her silver medal. She was dropped from the U.S. team before the last Summer Games.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday she crashed her bicycle all by herself and eventually fell out of the road race.</p>
        <p>After growing up in California, Holden now trains in Colorado, along with Longo-Ciprelli.</p>
        <p>''I always come second to her,'' Holden said today, sitting just to the right of her hero. ''I always said that one of these days I would beat her. I can't believe it happened here.''</p>
        <p>Asked if she can imagine racing at 41, as her friend does, Holden giggled and said, ''No.''</p>
        <p>She has a silver medal; Lance Armstrong, a legend of the sport, has only a bronze.</p>
