        <p>Nagisa Oshima's elegant historical film ''Gohatta'' recycles a familiar metaphor -- male homosexuality as a symbol of decadence -- that is so loaded with dramatic implication it simply refuses to die. Most of the movie is set in a school for samurai warriors in Kyoto in 1865, a moment when the samurai tradition was  crumbling with the advent of more efficient weapons technology. At this strict academy where minor infractions of the samurai code are punishable by death there suddenly appears an effeminate 18-year-old warrior whose seductive appeal wreaks havoc.</p>
        <p>From the moment he appears in the film, to be released commercially on Friday under the title ''Taboo,''  Sozaburo Kano (Ryuhei Matsuda) sets off disturbing vibrations. Although he proves himself such a gifted fighter that his superiors recognize him as a rising star, in interacting with his fellow students Kano deploys the wiles of an icy, enigmatic coquette.</p>
        <p>With his cold, cunning eyes set in a doll's face and his hair worn long in a fluffy pony tail (unlike his short-haired fellow soldiers), Kano wafts an androgynous sexual ambiguity that ignites an erotic brush fire in this monastic environment. The passivity he exudes when not fighting is  tinged with a coy hauteur; you wouldn't be surprised if he pulled out a fan and started batting his eyes.</p>
        <p>No sooner has Kano won an entrance test match against his opponent, Tashiro (Tadanobu Asano), than Tashiro falls madly in love with him and begins a relentless pursuit that is soon successful.</p>
        <p>But Kano, for all his apparent delicacy, is as capable of coldblooded brutality as the next soldier. In an early test of his mettle, he is ordered to carry out an execution (a beheading) and discharges his assignment with a poker-faced efficiency that pleases his superiors. Later in the film, when he is ordered to kill Tashiro, he agrees without betraying the tiniest flicker of emotion. The only outburst we hear about (it isn't shown) is his wailing protest when he is taken to a brothel for his sexual initiation with a woman and refuses to participate.</p>
        <p>''Gohatta'' isn't the first film by the Japanese director to dwell on the chaotic forces of unleashed sexuality in a repressive environment. His most famous film, ''In the Realm of the Senses'' (1976), probed the scary extremes of (heterosexual) passion and obsession. In this new film, the story is told formally, using a narrator (Kei Sato) and between-scene titles to maintain a studied distance. Much of ''Gohatta'' is bathed in shades of blue, and this painterly  ambience contributes to the film's otherworldly ethereality. It is set in the 19th century, but it could almost as easily be the 15th.</p>
        <p>Although his character hardly speaks and remains virtually expressionless, Mr. Matsuda's Kano conveys an ominous willfulness. Even during the film's one love scene  (with Tashiro) he seems entirely detached and unfeeling; beyond passively giving his body, he barely participates in the lovemaking. But this very passivity, which makes him seem ultimately unpossessable, only inflames his suitors.</p>
        <p>The film coolly gauges Kano's effects on everyone from the top brass  down. Even his avowedly heterosexual superiors (Beat Takeshi and Shinji Takeda), who are in awe of Kano's physical beauty, must admit to one another that they treat him more gently than the other soldiers.</p>
        <p>Although ''Gohatta'' isn't overtly political, the movie, which the New York Film Festival is showing today and Monday at Alice Tully Hall, subscribes to the same view of homosexuality as an inevitably disruptive force that is held by opponents of allowing openly gay people to serve in the military. It illustrates the underlying fear that when energies that should be directed toward warfare are diverted into passion, unity is impossible.</p>

        <p>FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW  Correction:  October 4, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, a film review on Saturday and its list of credits misspelled the original title of a movie that was screened at the New York Film Festival on Saturday and Monday. The film, directed by Nagisa Oshima and being released commercially on Friday as ''Taboo (Gohatto),'' was first called ''Gohatto,'' not ''Gohatta.''</p>
