        <p>Pavel Brendl finally scored last night. The question is whether Brendl's first goal of the preseason is enough to convince Rangers Coach Ron Low that the forward is ready to play in the National Hockey League.</p>
        <p>The Rangers lost to the Atlanta Thrashers, 4-2, at Madison Square Garden last night and will finish their preseason schedule tomorrow when they play the Islanders in Hartford.</p>
        <p>The Rangers will open the regular season next Saturday night in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''I know I can score,'' Brendl said. ''Hopefully, the people here know I can score.''</p>
        <p>Low said: ''We'll answer all those questions on Tuesday.''</p>
        <p>The 19-year-old Brendl had been a long shot to make the team, with some in the organization believing that Jamie Lundmark, the Rangers' other 19-year-old in camp, was better prepared to play in the N.H.L. Both players were selected in the first round of the 1999 entry draft. And, for the second consecutive camp, Lundmark was the most impressive in the eyes of the Rangers' staff.</p>
        <p>Brendl contributed a nifty goal last night, scoring from just off the left post on the power play.</p>
        <p>Brendl, who can play all three forward positions, also assisted on Petr Nedved's power-play goal in the first period.</p>
        <p>''Last year I had no clue,'' Brendl said. ''I wasn't in good shape. This year, I think I did my best.''</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, no Rangers were selected in the waiver draft.</p>
        <p>The Rangers did select Andreas Johansson, a 27-year-old left wing, from the Calgary Flames.</p>
        <p>The move was made simply to acquire Johansson's rights because Johansson, who has played for the Islanders, the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Ottawa Senators and the Tampa Bay Lightning, is expected to play in Switzerland this season.</p>
