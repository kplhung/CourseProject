        <p>An art review in Weekend on Sept. 1 about the history and collections of seven small museums in Maine commented briefly on a temporary exhibition that had recently opened at the Ogunquit Museum of American Art, ''Painted Air: American Impressionism,'' on view through Oct. 15. After listing some artists represented in the show, the reviewer wrote, ''It needs pruning.''</p>
        <p>The show had not yet been installed when the reviewer visited the museum, and the review should have made it clear that the opinion was based on the catalog alone.</p>
