        <p>For more than a decade, the varsity football teams at Edgemont High School in Westchester have spent the night before games eating together at a player's house and watching game films.</p>
        <p>It's a tradition that Edgemont, like many other successful high school programs, has followed rigorously to cultivate a winning atmosphere and a family environment.</p>
        <p>''We do it to let everyone know -- the players, the parents and the coaches -- that we're all in it together,'' said head coach Brian Connelly, whose teams have won 30 of 31 games the last three seasons.</p>
        <p>Edgemont, the two-time defending Class C champion, is coached by Connelly and his younger brother, Tim, the defensive coach, and boasts a roster in which one-third of the players are related.</p>
        <p>Edgemont (4-0) has been outscoring its opponents by a 50-point margin this season and had shutouts in three of its four games. The team has suited up four sets of brothers each week this season. The Bernsteins (Alex, Ben and Matt), the Brookses (Cameron and Jessie), the Andrewses (Billy and Joey) and the Ananias (Greg and Matt) account for 9 of the team's 27 players. Six sets of brothers are considered likely to make next season's varsity squad.</p>
        <p>''We have great chemistry on this team,'' said Connelly, who has compiled a record of 83-25-3 midway through his 13th season. ''I'm not sure if it's because we have so many brothers on this team or not. All I know is that we treat them all the same, as brothers, like a family.''</p>
        <p>The Bernstein brothers have attracted the most attention, largely because Matt, a fast and powerful running back, has signed with Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>Matt, a senior, is 6-foot-2 and weighs 250 pounds. He can run over defenders or use his speed to dart around them. He runs the 40-yard dash in 4.6 seconds. Matt is the Panthers' first player to earn a scholarship at a major Division I-A school.</p>
        <p>In the first four games this year, Matt, playing mostly in the first half because of Edgemont's dominance over opponents, has amassed 606 yards on 140 carries, while scoring 8 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>''He's the best player I've ever coached and the best player I've ever seen,'' Connelly said.</p>
        <p>Matt's younger brother, Alex, a junior, is a starting guard and linebacker. Alex, who played halfback last season, volunteered during the off-season to move from the backfield to the offensive line because he recognized a team need.</p>
        <p>Alex is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 175 pounds. He has used his speed (he runs the 40 in 4.8 seconds) to help clear the way for Edgemont's backs to rumble for more than 450 yards per game.</p>
        <p>At linebacker, Alex has recovered three fumbles, and he returned an interception 55 yards for a score in the team's most recent game, a 61-0 rout of Irvington on Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Ben Bernstein, a freshman, is expected to claim the starting halfback position next season, after Matt  graduates. Connelly said Ben is a quick learner who has adapted well to the varsity team.</p>
        <p>Matt said he had really enjoyed having Ben join the team. ''It's been great seeing my little brother, Ben, on the field, running sweeps and blocking people while I'm on the bench in the second half, enjoying a big lead,'' he said. ''It's real cool to share everything you do with your family.''</p>
        <p>The Brooks brothers are also having fun contributing to Edgemont's drive for a third consecutive championship.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, Cameron Brooks, a junior defensive back, was voted the game's most valuable player after making two interceptions in the Panthers' 55-0 victory over Pleasantville.</p>
        <p>Jessie Brooks, a freshman, is known as ''The Phenom.'' He handles the tailback duties (121 carries for 409 yards, 6 touchdowns), covers receivers dutifully (3 interceptions) and even takes care of the kicking responsibilities (25 of 30 conversions).</p>
        <p>''Playing on the same team has definitely brought us closer together, because we're sharing the same experiences,'' Cameron said.</p>
        <p>The Andrews brothers -- Billy and Joey -- figure to spend the next two seasons as Edgemont's bookend offensive tackles.</p>
        <p>Billy, a sophomore who plays defensive as well as offensive tackle, lines up to the left of Alex Bernstein to form a potent combination on the offensive line.</p>
        <p>Joey, a freshman, is projected to be a starter next year.</p>
        <p>Greg and Matt Anania, identical twins who are sophomores, do not start, but hope to claim the starting tight end and fullback positions, respectively, next season.</p>
        <p>So does all this brotherly love influence the team's chemistry?</p>
        <p>''I think that we're a closer team because of all the brothers,'' Billy Andrews said. ''We can yell at each other when we make a mistake in a way that only brothers can do. Usually, the brothers correct each other by picking him up, or yelling at him, or doing whatever it takes.''</p>
