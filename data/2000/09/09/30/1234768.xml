        <p>Thursday night's ''Classic Ellington'' concert at Carnegie Hall had Sir Simon Rattle conducting the Orchestra of St. Luke's through grand and frequently hokey rearrangements and orchestrations of Duke Ellington's music by Luther Henderson. Ten excellent jazz musicians were on hand, too. But you can't really out-arrange Ellington, who had so much classical music within him in the first place. Aside from the record-business instinct that crossovers are good, what could have been the theory behind this?</p>
        <p>A clue was in the concert's program notes -- and in the liner notes for the accompanying album, also called ''Classic Ellington,'' on EMI Classics -- where Mr. Henderson writes: ''Rooted in the African culture, which informs its disciplines and persuasions, jazz directly reflects the heartbeat and primal sounds of nature.''

        <p>Thursday night's ''Classic Ellington'' concert at Carnegie Hall had Sir Simon Rattle conducting the Orchestra of St. Luke's through grand and frequently hokey rearrangements and orchestrations of Duke Ellington's music by Luther Henderson. Ten excellent jazz musicians were on hand, too. But you can't really out-arrange Ellington, who had so much classical music within him in the first place. Aside from the record-business instinct that crossovers are good, what could have been the theory behind this?</p>
        <p>A clue was in the concert's program notes -- and in the liner notes for the accompanying album, also called ''Classic Ellington,'' on EMI Classics -- where Mr. Henderson writes: ''Rooted in the African culture, which informs its disciplines and persuasions, jazz directly reflects the heartbeat and primal sounds of nature.'' Raise your eyebrows a bit? If not, read on: ''Jazz is folk art and Ellington is the quintessential jazz composer.''</p>
        <p>Looking at the jazz soloists on stage -- who included the saxophonists Joe Lovano and Bobby Watson, the pianist Geri Allen, the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon and the flugelhornist Clark Terry -- I saw practitioners of a closely guarded, increasingly nonvernacular music with its own professional hierarchy, many of whom had university degrees in their musical background. So these were folk musicians?</p>
        <p>Throughout the Henderson-Rattle project runs the insistence that jazz is over here, with an African postmark, and classical music over there, with European cologne. But they've been mingling naturally for at least 80 years; that's what American culture is all about. This fusion-from-without of ''Classic Ellington'' is a very literal-minded not to mention out-of-date way of dealing with Ellington, who wrote music that was a natural fusion from within.</p>
        <p>The concert reflected its shaky conceptual grounds. The jazz had little breathing room and no vitality under these circumstances; the orchestra, when reduced to a mere backing role, had no grandeur. At its worst each part was fussy and inefficient window dressing for the other.</p>
        <p>The first half had the most problems. Mr. Henderson's orchestrations skillfully combined bits and pieces of Ellington performances, but in the older songs -- including versions of ''It Don't Mean a Thing,'' ''Take the A Train'' and ''Sophisticated Lady'' -- there was no meaningful integration between band and orchestra; the jazz parts that broke away from the orchestra sounded homely and straitjacketed.</p>
        <p>Things improved in the second half. Mr. Henderson's rearrangement of Ellington's ''Harlem'' was by far the most thoroughly conceived piece: rapidly changing, through composed (as Ellington's original was), with the jazz rhythm section playing in a style hardly at all resembling jazz; the jazz horn soloists remained offstage. What followed certainly was not great improvisation, and the rearrangement washed out most of Ellington's more biting and original harmonies, in a sense making it less classical than before.</p>
        <p>Some selections from Ellington and Billy Strayhorn's ''Far East Suite'' worked, too, because they are such unusual jazz pieces, made of many parts with greatly contrasting moods, and because some jazz musicians finally had a moment to breathe: Geri Allen got at Ellington's percussive piano rhythms for more than a two-bar break.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, ''Classic Ellington'' was Ellington redone in Mr. Henderson's metier: Broadway music. But it seemed a strangely naive project, unconscious of its shortcomings, illustrated perfectly when Sir Simon, introducing a version of ''It Don't Mean a Thing,'' mimicked English schoolchildren singing that famous refrain without putting any swing on it. ''One of the more serious examples of missing the point,'' he said. Minutes later, the French horns were doing exactly what he had been poking fun at.</p>
