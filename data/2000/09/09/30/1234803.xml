        <p>In a case watched closely by advocates of press freedom and human rights, a Turkish journalist was acquitted today of charges that she insulted the military in a book about the war against Kurdish separatists.</p>
        <p>The journalist, Nadire Mater, wrote ''Mehmet's Book,'' an oral history based on interviews with 42 army veterans, many of whom expressed disillusionment with their role in fighting Kurdish insurgents in southeastern Turkey in the 1980's and 1990's.</p>

        <p>In a case watched closely by advocates of press freedom and human rights, a Turkish journalist was acquitted today of charges that she insulted the military in a book about the war against Kurdish separatists.</p>
        <p>The journalist, Nadire Mater, wrote ''Mehmet's Book,'' an oral history based on interviews with 42 army veterans, many of whom expressed disillusionment with their role in fighting Kurdish insurgents in southeastern Turkey in the 1980's and 1990's.</p>
        <p>The words of the anonymous conscripts were explosive in Turkey, where criticizing the military is a crime, and the book was banned and confiscated in June 1999. Criminal charges against Ms. Mater and her publisher, Semih Sokmen, followed three months later, and they faced up to 12 years in prison.</p>
        <p>But as the pair stood in a small, packed courtroom this afternoon, a three-judge panel ruled unanimously that no crime had been committed, and the charges were dismissed. The judges also lifted the ban on the book, with a one-week delay to give the prosecutor time to appeal.</p>
        <p>On the courthouse steps, Ms. Mater expressed relief for herself, but concern for other journalists who face criminal charges in Turkey. ''This is a good step, but it doesn't solve all the problems with freedom of expression in Turkey,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Kati Marton, an author and board member of the Committee to Protect Journalists in New York, attended the hearing and praised the court's decision. ''This is a good day for journalists and a good day for Turkey,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Turkey has been under pressure from the European Union to ease its tight limits on speech as part of its effort to win membership. People can be jailed for insulting the military, advocating an Islamic regime or inciting ethnic or religious hatred.</p>
        <p>A former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan, faces prison for a political speech, and the former mayor of Istanbul was banned from politics for five years. Journalists and human rights advocates have also been jailed for writings and speeches. Among those at the hearing were Akin Birdal, a leading human rights advocate released from prison this week, and Oral Calislar, a prominent columnist imprisoned for publishing an interview with a jailed Kurdish military leader.</p>
