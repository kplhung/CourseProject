        <p>A 41-year-old Brooklyn woman was arrested yesterday morning after she robbed a Sheepshead Bay bank with a pellet gun and made her getaway on a crowded city bus, the police said.</p>
        <p>The woman, Valerie Coletti of 2256 Ralph Avenue, was arrested a few blocks from the Banco Popular at 1619 Sheepshead Bay Road, the police said. They said a teller flagged a police van and told the officers that a blond woman wearing brown gloves and sunglasses had just robbed the bank and boarded the B-49 bus.</p>
        <p>When the officers boarded the bus a few blocks away at a traffic light at Ocean Avenue and Avenue Z, they found Ms. Coletti sitting in the back, clutching a blue plastic bag filled with $8,300 in unmarked bills, a pair of sneakers, a plastic beverage cooler and two pellet guns, they said. She has been charged with armed robbery and weapons possession, the police said.</p>
        <p>The officers said that Ms. Coletti, whom they described as a frail woman about five feet tall, told them that she used a disability pass to board the bus because she did not have enough money for a cab.</p>
        <p>The officers said that as they escorted her off the bus, Ms. Coletti told them, ''Going to jail is better than home.''</p>
