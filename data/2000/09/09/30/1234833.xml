        <p>In a rare moment of national unity, Canadians suspended political and regional differences yesterday to take stock of how much their nation, and their lives, had been molded in the image of their prime minister of 16 years, Pierre Elliott Trudeau.</p>
        <p>On city streets, newspapers with special Trudeau supplements sold out, quietly but quickly. In Parliament, members on both sides of the aisle placed red roses, a Trudeau signature, in their lapels. And in Quebec City, after several hours of debate, separatist politicians finally lowered the province's blue and white fleur-de-lis flag, grudging homage to a Quebecois who, time after time, had checkmated their nationalist aspirations.</p>
        <p>For Canadians over 30, it was a realization that their nation's strong father figure, one they alternately loved and cursed, was gone.</p>
        <p>''In an odd way, our childhood really has ended,'' reflected Catherine Annau, a 35-year-old who last year directed an award-winning movie, ''Just Watch Me: Trudeau and the '70's Generation.'' ''He reshaped the country profoundly. This whole ideal that we could be bilingual, sophisticated, romantic, came about because he was bilingual, sophisticated, romantic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Trudeau's passing in his sleep Thursday afternoon at 80 surprised few Canadians. Two years ago, the nation watched as their once muscular and charismatic leader appeared frail and shaken at a memorial service for his youngest son, Michel, who was killed at 23 by an avalanche in British Columbia.</p>
        <p>''Many wept with him that cold day, in large part for the loss of youth, but in no small part -- and we must now acknowledge this -- for the loss of our own youth,'' Roy MacGregor, a veteran political reporter, wrote today in The National Post, a conservative newspaper.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a leathery politician toughened by parliamentary battles stretching over almost four decades, seemed on the verge of tears Thursday night when he announced Mr. Trudeau's death to reporters traveling with him in Jamaica. He cut short his foreign trip and flew back to Ottawa, where he said Friday of his political mentor, ''Pierre came to love this land as he climbed its mountain peaks, conquered the rapids of its rivers and wandered the streets of its cities.''</p>
        <p>After leaders of Canada's five political parties offered tributes, parliamentary sessions were suspended until Wednesday. In Parliament's Hall of Honor, Mr. Trudeau's body is to lie in state on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
        <p>A state funeral, Canada's first in almost a decade, is planned for Tuesday in Montreal. Planners expect thousands of mourners and dozens of foreign dignitaries. Were it not for Mr. Trudeau's eloquence and his incarnation of a bilingual, bicultural society, the ranking head of state next week at Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica might well have been of an independent Quebec.</p>
        <p>La Presse, Quebec's most prestigious French-language daily, headlined on its front page yesterday, ''A love-hate relationship'' and ''A hero for English Canada.'' Crediting Mr. Trudeau for panache and charm, the newspaper said he had ''erased the idea that Canada was an uninteresting, backward country.''</p>
        <p>The survival of Canada as a nation is perhaps Mr. Trudeau's greatest legacy. Others include removing British control over the Constitution; adopting a charter of rights similar to the American Bill of Rights; officially setting French and English on equal footing across the land; and promoting multiculturalism, prompted by the opening of doors to immigrants from Asia, Africa and Latin America.</p>
        <p>During the Nixon presidency in the United States, Mr. Trudeau's liberal, tolerant vision of society was a magnet for many Americans who emigrated to Canada, said Ms. Annau, the filmmaker. ''We were going to create this incredibly open and tolerant society,'' she said.</p>
