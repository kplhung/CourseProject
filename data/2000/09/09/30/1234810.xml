        <p>FUN is winning.</p>
        <p>Losing is no fun.</p>
        <p>Someone has to win; someone has to lose.</p>
        <p>These Olympics have so many versions of winning and losing -- five or six a day, depending on the event, the athlete, the expectations.</p>
        <p>Marion Jones gave another variation last night when her quest for a unique place in history ended where many thought it would: in the long-jump pit.</p>
        <p>Heike Drechsler of Germany won the event in what has become a typical Sydney performance: not record-breaking, not especially beautiful. Tough, grueling, Olympian.</p>
        <p>Fiona May of Italy won her second consecutive silver, and Jones finished third.</p>
        <p>When someone asked Jones if, given all that has happened here -- including her husband's positive drug tests -- she was having fun at her first Olympics, Jones said: ''Fun is winning. That's what it comes down to.''</p>
        <p>She came to Sydney with a goal of becoming the first female track-and-field athlete to win five gold medals in an Olympics. She has had a pretty special Olympics: gold in the 100 meters, gold in the 200, a bronze medal in the long jump. A bronze medal in her part-time sport.</p>
        <p>Jones took six jumps and fouled on four of them. Her last jump would have been the best of the competition, but she fouled. The red flag went up on the jump, on her place in history.</p>
        <p>''On the last jump, you have to lay it all on the line,'' Jones said. ''This is what every athlete dreams of: coming back on your last jump and jumping further than you ever have in your life.</p>
        <p>''I was very aggressive down the runway, very fast. Thought I took off well, looked around and saw I was around that seven-meter mark; unfortunately I turned around and saw the gentleman flip up that red flag and kind of dashed all my hopes.''</p>
        <p>Going into these Sydney Games, Jones knew that the downside of setting her goals so high was that her first Olympics might seem hollow if she missed reaching even one of her hoped-for five gold medals. Now she was admitting she felt that way.</p>
        <p>''I'm disappointed in myself,'' she said. ''I let myself down today and over all. I'll be able to look back on my Sydney experience and smile and say it was a very good experience, especially if we win two golds tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Had Jones won the bronze in the 100 meters or 200 meters, you could reasonably call it a failure -- a star who did not live up to her potential when it mattered most. But for all the criticism of Jones's technique, she did not lose the long jump: the 35-year-old Drechsler won it.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you separate yourself from a riveting narrative and detour to a compelling side story. Drechsler is such a story.</p>
        <p>She is a single mother who has lived several Olympic lives, and competed through the reunification of a country.</p>
        <p>Drechsler is the last of the old German Democratic Republic stars, from an era of great performances and suspect methods. When someone brought up the old system, Drechsler was curt: ''Not going to talk about that.''</p>
        <p>Drechsler was 18 when she won the long jump at the 1983 world championships, the year her rivalry with Jackie Joyner-Kersee began. Drechsler's first Olympics was the 1988 Seoul Games, when she was outdueled by Joyner-Kersee, who set an Olympic record in the process.</p>
        <p>Four years later in Barcelona, Drechsler won the gold medal, Joyner-Kersee won the bronze.</p>
        <p>Drechsler missed the 1996 Games. Competing there in her last Olympics, Joyner was hampered by a right hamstring injury but leapt from seventh to third on her final attempt. She wept; winning bronze was like winning gold.</p>
        <p>Last night, after a year of tight competition with Jones and May, Drechsler was right at the right time.</p>
        <p>She spoke about the difference between winning on this day and in 1992, when her country was just beginning the mending process.</p>
        <p>''Just 11 years ago and now, we're coming together,'' she said. ''The team is really a team and I don't feel like East or West. We are a team.</p>
        <p>''It's not so easy for the people,'' she added. ''East and West have other history and it's not so easy pulling together; this will be a generation problem, but I feel we have now distanced ourselves and we are really a team.''</p>
        <p>In the eyes of a global audience, Marion Jones has gone from spectacular and historic to merely tremendous. She goes from possibly winning five golds to winning ''just four.''</p>
        <p>She can take heart in the fact that Wilma Rudolph -- one of the greatest female sprinters of all time -- won ''only'' three gold medals at the 1960 Games, and we still invoke her name.</p>
        <p>Jones knows all this and knows that the further she goes from Sydney, the more special her first Olympics will be. For now, the bottom line is the bottom line. ''Fun is winning,'' Jones said last night.</p>
        <p>''I'll just leave it at that.''</p>
