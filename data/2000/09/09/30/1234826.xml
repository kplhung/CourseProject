        <p>There have long been two competing visions of Europe's future. The first envisages a loose association of democratic nations; the second dreams of a federal United States of Europe, a power that the French see balancing American ''hegemony.''</p>
        <p>In the last week, two seemingly disparate events -- the Danish rejection of Europe's common currency and the new challenge to Slobodan Milosevic's hold on power in Yugoslavia -- appear to have shifted the balance away from the ''deep'' European federation dear to many German and Gallic hearts, and toward a ''wide'' quilt of democracies.</p>
        <p>For if Mr. Milosevic is removed from power, as now seems more likely than at any time in the last decade, the last major obstacle to a Europe of democracies and market economies from the Atlantic to the Urals would disappear. Such liberty, for the whole continent, would be unprecedented, and would effectively achieve what former President George Bush called ''a Europe whole and free.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, the Danes have given a clear signal by their vote that ''deep Europe'' -- the idea of eventually forging a federal European government and parliament with real authority, as suggested this year by the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer -- faces severe problems because attachment to national identity is resurgent in some areas.</p>
        <p>Most ministers from the 15-nation European Union tried today to put a brave face on the Danish vote, pointing out that the Danish economy is small. The euro held steady at its low level of 88 cents, reflecting the fact that a Danish rejection had already been factored in. But Karl-Heinz Grasser, the right-wing Austrian finance minister, put the situation bluntly: ''This is certainly a step back for European integration.''</p>
        <p>Five years ago, Helmut Kohl, as German chancellor, made clear his determination to compel Europe toward that integration. ''We will make the process of unifying Europe irreversible in the next two years or so,'' he declared in 1995.</p>
        <p>His chosen weapon was the euro, and the ''Europe'' he referred to was the narrow Europe of the European Union. Throughout the 1990's, Western European governments focused on the creation of the euro even as a ''velvet curtain'' was quietly established keeping post-Communist states like Poland and Hungary outside the European Union.</p>
        <p>That policy had several consequences: post-Communist states joined NATO before linking with their European neighbors; the European Union long paid scant attention to the violent upheavals that swept southeastern Europe; and signs of suspicion began to emerge between Western Europe and its cold-shouldered Central European neighbors.</p>
        <p>In an article titled ''Who will defend the cause of an enlarged Europe?'' four European intellectuals asked that question in Le Monde this week: ''Why, more than a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, have Western European leaders done so little to convince their populations that the extension of the the European Union to the center, east and southeastern Europe is in their long-term interest?''</p>
        <p>After the Danish vote, a shift of focus toward answering that question seems inevitable. European ''deepening'' has been battered. At the very least, as Jonathan Eyal, a British strategic analyst, observed, ''the Danes have ensured that those European countries that want rapid political integration will be obliged to do it alone.''</p>
        <p>In other words, if Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium want a single European defense, a single foreign policy, a single economic policy and ultimately some sort of pan-European government behind the euro, they will probably have to go ahead and do it without Denmark, Britain and other states more suspicious of the ''unification'' that was always the political project that the euro masked.</p>
        <p>A ''two-speed'' Europe would result, one potentially more attractive to the likes of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, countries daunted by the budgetary and other demands of joining the euro and suspicious of any abandonment of the sovereignty they have only just recovered from the defunct Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>But there are problems in the path of a victory of European ''widening'' over ''deepening.'' Some of the very forces propelling a reaction against European federalism are nationalist movements suspicious of immigration and of what they portray as a potential ''invasion'' of cheap labor from the east if countries like Poland, let alone Balkan republics, are allowed into the European Union.</p>
        <p>Pia Kjaersgaard in Denmark and Jorg Haider in Austria are among the politicians who have won a strong following with such a mesage. Their appeal is likely to be accentuated if Europe's current upbeat economic mood sours.</p>
        <p>Another obstacle to Europe looking east rather than inward is the euro's problematic path. Markets see a common currency unbacked by the coherent fiscal policies that a single government provides, so pressure exists for more political integration. ''A politically weak Europe produces a weak euro,'' said Dominique Moisi, a French political analyst. ''It's as simple as that.'' What is not simple, especially after the Danish vote, is to know what to do about that conundrum.</p>
        <p>Far clearer, in recent days, is the European conviction that Mr. Milosevic must go. The governments of the European Union, which long compromised with Mr. Milosevic, have been swift and trenchant in backing the Yugoslav opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, in his electoral victory. A ''Europe whole and free'' seems to have become a realistic goal.</p>
        <p>For the United States, this ''wide'' Europe is appealing. Although the Clinton administration has always said European unification is in America's interest, and formally supported the euro, the strategic attraction to Washington of a federal United States of Europe has never been entirely clear.</p>
        <p>But a democratic Europe at peace, cooperating economically without integrating politically, heterogeneous rather than monolithic, poses no such problems. For it offers the United States a vast and stable market, without the European political cohesion that might one day counter or offset American strategic dominance.</p>
