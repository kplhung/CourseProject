        <p>A mistrial has been declared in the trial of Pedro Espada Jr., the Democratic State Senate nominee for the 32nd District in the Bronx, because a defense lawyer in the case had a death in the family.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada is charged with second-degree grand larceny. He is accused of using $221,000 from the Universal Health Plan, a health maintenance organization for Medicaid-eligible patients that he established in 1994, to pay campaign expenses for him and his son.</p>
        <p>The health plan was paid for with city and state money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada is also facing lesser charges related to accusations that false reports were filed with the state. He has two co-defendants, Sandra Love, who was on the board of the Universal Health Plan, and John P. Connors, who was the executive director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada has long maintained that his indictment was politically motivated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada defeated the incumbent, David Rosado, in the Democratic primary Sept. 12, and his trial began soon afterward. After the wife of Murray Richman, one of the defense lawyers, died, the trial was suspended. The judge in the case, Justice Steven L. Barrett of State Supreme Court in the Bronx, then declared a mistrial.</p>
        <p>The selection of a new jury is to begin Monday.</p>
