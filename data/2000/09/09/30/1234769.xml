        <p>When trucks laden with corn roll up to the gate of the huge Azteca flour mill here at the base of the Texas Panhandle, they must stop at a little shack. A long thin probe is inserted into the truck and 10 to 15 pounds of corn is sucked through a tube into the shack, where the corn is tested for a fungal toxin, moisture, color, cracks and broken kernels.</p>
        <p>But there is no test for the corn's variety and whether it has been genetically modified. ''We don't see a feasible way to positively ID the genetic composition of every corn that comes into the plant,'' said Dan Lynn, the president of Azteca Milling.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the mill wishes it had. Last week, Kraft Foods, a unit of Philip Morris, recalled millions of taco shells after its tests showed that some contained a type of genetically modified corn unapproved for human consumption because of concerns it might cause allergic reactions. And the flour in those taco shells was made at this big mill, the nation's largest production plant for the type of corn flour used in tortillas and tacos.</p>
        <p>The incident has raised questions about the regulation of genetically engineered crops and has cast an uncomfortable spotlight on Azteca, which is controlled by Gruma S.A. of Mexico, the world's largest tortilla producer, but is partly owned by Archer Daniels Midland, the giant Illinois grain processor.</p>
        <p>Azteca Milling, based in Irving, Tex., is now scrambling to confirm whether the unapproved corn, known as StarLink, is indeed in its flour and, if so, how it got there, while also trying to reassure customers.</p>
        <p>The company says it buys corn only from farmers under contract, who grow only varieties on a list issued by the company. No genetically modified corn, let alone the unapproved variety, was on its list.</p>
        <p>People who supply corn to Azteca agree that the company is strict in controlling the corn it uses. But with most corn looking alike and huge amounts of it moving around, accidental mix-ups or deliberate attempts to pass one variety as another cannot be totally avoided. Corn buyers rely to some extent on the honesty of farmers.</p>
        <p>''We don't do a blood test on everybody who comes across the scales,'' said Chuck Dorrity, a farmer who sells corn to Azteca through a local grain elevator.</p>
        <p>Still, conversations with farmers here indicate that Azteca might be somewhat exaggerating the extent of its controls. Some people say Azteca stopped accepting genetically modified crops this year but accepted some in 1999, the year in which the corn used in the suspect taco shells was grown.</p>
        <p>''Everything I grew for them was Bt, but it was approved varieties,'' said Bill Hayes, a farmer near Plainview. Bt, or Bacillus thuringiensis, refers to genetically modified corn that produces a bacterial toxin that kills the corn borer.</p>
        <p>Mike Harder, a manager of Southwestern Grain Inc., a grain elevator here, said the elevator sent Bt corn to the Plainview mill last year while sending nonmodified grain to another Azteca plant in South Texas to serve export markets.</p>
        <p>Asked about these comments, Mr. Lynn and Sarah Wright, Azteca's spokeswoman, repeatedly and vigorously denied that any Bt corn was ever on Azteca's approved list, although they said some had been grown as a test.</p>
        <p>In any case, Bt corns other than StarLink are approved for human consumption and permeate the nation's food supply. The big mystery is how the StarLink, approved for use as animal feed, got into the flour.</p>
        <p>Some think it was just a mix-up. Others believe a farmer passed off cattle feed as human corn to get a higher price. Still others say StarLink corn might have cross-pollinated other corn in a nearby field. Or the mill could have made a spot purchase from a grain elevator to relieve a temporary shortage. It is also unknown whether the contamination was small, such as a single truckload, or more extensive.</p>
        <p>So little StarLink is grown in this area that most farmers interviewed said they had never heard of it until it appeared in the news. The Garst Seed Company, the main distributor, estimates that there are only 300 acres of StarLink within 100 miles of the mill, less than the acreage of a single typical farm.</p>
        <p>Garst would not release the names of the growers but said they were being contacted. So far, ''we have no growers that have indicated in any way, shape or form that they sent any corn down the wrong channel,'' said W. David Witherspoon, the president of Garst.</p>
        <p>So maybe the corn came from elsewhere. Azteca buys some corn from Kansas. Moreover, the Texas Panhandle imports corn by the train  load from the Midwest to feed all its cattle. The question then would be how cattle feed that came by train would get to Azteca, which contracts directly with farmers for its corn.</p>
        <p>It turns out that the mill does not always deal directly with farmers. It sometimes contracts with grain elevators, which in turn contract with farmers. These elevators also handle cattle feed, introducing the possibility for a mix-up.</p>
        <p>Perhaps significantly, Azteca goes through elevators more for yellow corn than for white corn. StarLink is a yellow corn, and it was flour made from yellow corn that was used in the recalled taco shells. Most cattle feed is yellow corn, while white corn is grown almost exclusively for food.</p>
        <p>Still, most of the yellow corn used by Azteca has a white cob, grain elevator operators said. StarLink has a red cob, so it is possible to tell the difference. But the Azteca mill does use some red cob corn, so a shipment of StarLink might not automatically have been suspect.</p>
        <p>Farmers say that when they send grain to Azteca they are asked to state its variety on a form. Azteca officials say they often inspect fields before harvest and also look at the farmer's receipts for the purchase of seed.</p>
        <p>But there are apparently some cases in which Azteca did not look at seed receipts, and it is now becoming more vigilant, people here say.</p>
        <p>Gladwin Gillispie, a farmer in Dumas, north of Amarillo, said he and his sons were asked by Azteca about a week ago for their year-old seed purchase receipts. ''They hadn't asked for the receipts before,'' he said. He said he was puzzled because he grows only white corn for Azteca, not the yellow corn involved in the incident.</p>
        <p>The Plainview mill, with a capacity of 225,000 metric tons a year, opened in 1989. With 220 employees, it is one of the larger employers, though far from the largest, in this city of 22,000, which celebrates itself as the hometown of Jimmy Dean, the entertainer and sausage maker.</p>
        <p>Azteca, saying its production method is proprietary, did not allow a reporter into the mill, showing only the corn inspection station outside.</p>
        <p>Some farmers here worry that the taco shell incident will hurt Azteca's business. The mill is one of the biggest buyers of corn for food, which can fetch a price of as much as 70 cents a bushel more than corn for cattle feed.</p>
        <p>''They are about the only one left that's buying food corn,'' said David Ford, a farmer in Dumas. Frito-Lay, which once bought corn in the Panhandle, moved to Nebraska, he said.</p>
        <p>Many farmers here say that because of low corn prices and a declining water table, they are shifting from corn to cotton, which uses less water. The recent rise in energy prices, which will increase irrigation costs further, will accelerate the trend. ''This will probably be the last year I grow corn,'' Mr. Hayes said.</p>
        <p>Some farmers here grow Bt corn and say it saves them money needed to spray for the corn borer. Others do not use Bt corn because the seed is more expensive or because they still have to spray for other pests anyway. But all farmers interviewed said they supported biotechnology and said the biotechnology opponents, who first discovered the StarLink in the taco shells, were raising baseless fears.</p>
        <p>''Ninety percent of the people in the world would love to have those taco shells,'' said Jerry Harder, president of the Southwestern Grain elevator. ''Those environmentalists should have to go to Russia and stand in line for two hours for a loaf of bread.''</p>
        <p>Aventis, the European drug company that developed StarLink, suspended sales of the seeds this week. The Plainview mill has stopped making and selling yellow flour, which accounts for about 15 to 20 percent of its output. That production has been shifted to other Azteca mills, and Azteca has not lost any business, said Mr. Lynn, the president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynn said the company's tests for StarLink, performed by outside laboratories, were inconclusive. Sometimes the corn tests negative and the flour tests positive. Sometimes multiple samples from the same lot of flour give different results.</p>
        <p>The company is about to begin testing corn arriving at the mill for the presence of StarLink, using a new test introduced this week by Strategic Diagnostics. Shipments of yellow flour should resume soon. The whodunit, however, might remain unsolved.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure we'll ever know what happened,'' Mr. Lynn said, ''if it happened.''</p>
