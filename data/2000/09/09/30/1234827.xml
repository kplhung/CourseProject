        <p>A state judge sentenced the president of the Buffalo teachers' union to 15 days in jail and fined him $1,000 yesterday for defying a court order barring teachers from striking during this month's tumultuous contract negotiations.</p>
        <p>In announcing the sentence, Justice Kevin M. Dillon of State Supreme Court said the president, Philip Rumore, 58, had shown no intention of obeying the order and that his actions hurt students and the city. ''You did a disservice to your members,'' Justice Dillon said.</p>
        <p>The judge also ordered two other union officials, Edith Le Win, the vice president, and Barbara Bielecki, the secretary, to each pay a $1,000 fine.</p>
        <p>The 3,800 members of the Buffalo Teachers Federation went on strike Sept. 7 and 14 after reaching an impasse with the school district over issues like salaries and health care provisions.</p>
