        <p>Cuba won its 24th and 25th Olympic boxing gold medals since the 1972 Olympic Games today when the bantamweight Guillermo Rigondeaux and the lightweight Mario Kindelan easily won their finals in the 2000 Olympic tournament.</p>
        <p>Rigondeaux and Kindelan represent two phases of the mighty Cuban boxing program. Rigondeaux, who turned 20 years old today, is part of the new blood on the Cuban team: young and fluid with a host of ring skills.</p>
        <p>Kindelan is 29, a reigning world champion who has been boxing for Cuba for 15 years. He exemplifies the Cuban boxing tradition: a strong, powerful counterpuncher with a good defense and ring presence.</p>
        <p>Rigondeaux rallied to overcome Raimkoul Malakhbekov of Russia for an 18-12 victory in his final bout. Malakhbekov had been scoring consistently against Rigondeaux in the first two rounds, but Rigondeaux eventually found openings in Malakhbekov's defense and exploited them repeatedly to take a comfortable lead in the third and fourth rounds.</p>
        <p>Clarence Vinson of the Unite States, whom Rigondeaux defeated in his path to the finals, was one of two bronze medalists, along with Serguey Daniltchenko of Ukraine.</p>
        <p>''The gold medal is not just for me, but for Cuba,'' Rigondeaux said after his victory. ''I want to go for the gold again in four years.''</p>
        <p>Kindelan defeated Andriy Kotelnyk of Ukraine on points, 14-4. Kindelan was never behind in his fight, getting through Kotelnyk's defense with lefts and rights to build a large, early lead.</p>
        <p>The lightweight bronze medals went to Cristian Bejarano of Mexico and Aleksandr Maletin of Russia.</p>
        <p>Cuba's gold medal tally is the most of any country in the last 30 years of Olympic boxing, and Cuba did not participate in two recent Olympics -- Los Angeles in 1984 and Seoul in 1988.</p>
        <p>Brahim Asloum of France, who first came to prominence in the 2000 Olympic boxing tournament when he upset the American world champion Brian Viloria, concluded his march through the light flyweight division today with a convincing final to win the first gold medal awarded at the boxing site.</p>
        <p>Asloum defeated Rafael Munoz of Spain, 23-10, taking command of the bout early and never trailing. The bronze medalists were Maikro Romero of Cuba and Un Choi Kim of Korea.</p>
        <p>Asloum, 21, used a steady jab to pile up points, but it was his defense that won the gold medal. Viloria was the pre-tournament gold medal favorite but found Asloum difficult to hit. Meeting in the second round, Asloum upset Viloria on points, 6-4.</p>

        <p>SAILING: BRITON WINS -- Iain Percy secured Britain's third sailing medal of the Sydney Games when he secured an unbeatable lead in the men's Finn dinghy class today after the 10th race of the 11-race series. Percy, the 1999 European Finn champion, went into the final day of competition with an almost unassailable lead of 20 points over last year's world champion, Fredrik Loof of Sweden.</p>
        <p>With each competitor allowed to discard their worst two finishes in the 11-race series, Percy placed 14th in Race 10.</p>
        <p>The 24-year-old from Southampton did not start in the final race and discarded both results to stay on a net 26 points.</p>
        <p>Loof could manage only an 11th placing in Race 10, giving him a minimum possible total of 41 points even if he won race 11.</p>
        <p>Loof will battle the Atlanta gold medalist Mateusz Kusznierewicz of Poland and Italy's Luca Devoti for the bronze medal over the final race.</p>
        <p>Percy dominated the early stages of the men's single-handed dinghy class, claiming three firsts among six top-five placings in the first nine races and never finished outside the top 10 before today.</p>
        <p>Britain's best previous Olympic sailing performance was a four-gold haul in the 1908 Games. Shirley Robertson, a Scot, won the women's Europe dinghy class yesterday and Ben Ainslie took the gold in the open Laser dinghy class. (Reuters)</p>
        <p>CANOE-KAYAK: PEREZ AND U.S. FALTER -- Angel Perez beat the system to get into the Olympics. But he was not able to help the United States' four-man kayak team beat the best in the world today. The United States finished sixth in the 1,000-meter K-4 finals, never leading in a race filled with world champions. Making the finals was a first for the Americans.</p>
        <p>The United States boat, which had been ahead halfway through its qualifying heat, was fifth after 500 meters and dropped to sixth by 750. The foursome crossed the finish more than four seconds behind the gold-medal winner, Hungary, and was 2.28 seconds behind Poland for the bronze. Germany won the silver.</p>
        <p>The Cuban-born Perez was a big reason the Americans were even in the finals, although as recently as last week he did not expect to be in the boat. He was so convinced he had lost his eligibility battle that he packed his suitcases.</p>
        <p>Perez's problem was being a United States citizen for only one year, two fewer than Olympic rules require. But the Court of Arbitration for Sport let him in after he argued that he gave up his Cuban citizenship when he defected in 1993.</p>
        <p>Perez represented his homeland in the 1992 Olympics, but his medal chances were shattered by a broken paddle. He fled a year later and became a United States resident in 1995. He started competing internationally again in 1997.</p>
        <p>The K-4 featuring Perez, Peter Newton, Stein Jorgensen and John Mooney was considered the best chance for the United States to win its first kayaking medal since 1992.</p>

        <p>WRESTLING: AMERICANS ADVANCE -- Sammie Henson and Brandon Slay completed a perfect day for United States wrestlers, each winning twice yesterday to move into gold-medal matches today. Among them, the six American wrestlers were 8-0.</p>
        <p>Henson pinned German Kontoev of Belarus in the 119-pound semifinals. Earlier, Henson -- the 1998 world champion -- fell behind Oleksandr Zakharuk of Ukraine, 4-0, before rallying to win, 8-4. Henson will fight Namig Abdullayev of Azerbaijan in the final.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Slay, a 25-year-old Texan who is wrestling in his first major international competition, upset the four-time world champion Bouvaissa Saitiev at 167 1/2 pounds. Yesterday, Slay won two close matches, a referee's decision over Gennadi Laliyev of Kazakhstan after the two tied, 2-2, and a 3-1 victory over Adam Bereket of Turkey. The decision was protested by Turkey, but the protest was not upheld. Slay meets Alexander Leipold, who pinned Eui-jae Moon of South Korea while trailing by 1-0 with 10 seconds left in overtime. Leipold, of Germany, was a 1994 world champion and is a five-time world medalist.</p>
        <p>Terry Brands, the brother of the 1996 gold medalist Tom Brands, won, 6-0, over Abil Ibragimov of Kazakstan at 127 3/4 pounds. Lincoln McIlravy, who was second in last year's world championships at 152 pounds, won by injury default over Ibo Oziti of Nigeria. Kerry McCoy won, 3-0, in overtime over Merabi Valiev of Ukraine at heavyweight. Charles Burton won by 4-0 over Alioune Diouf of Senegal at 187 1/4 pounds. (AP)</p>
        <p>SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING: RUSSIAN TEAM WINS -- Russia won the team competition with a witch-themed routine yesterday, adding to the gold medal it won in the duet earlier. The Russians earned two perfect 10's for technical marks, and two 10's for artistic impression. (AP)</p>
        <p>TAEKWONDO: GOLD TO SOUTH KOREA -- Angel Fuentes of Cuba defeated Faissal Ebnoutalib of Germany in the men's welterweight class. Lee Sun-hee won South Korea's first gold medal in the sport over Trude Gundersen of Norway in the women's welterweight. (AP)</p>
        <p>EQUESTRIAN: DUTCHWOMAN WINS -- Anky van Grunsven and Bonfire of the Netherlands overtook Isabell Werth and Gigolo of Germany in the Grand Prix Special test, continuing a rivalry the two have had over six years. Christine Traurig, of Carlsbad, Calif., riding Etienne, and Susan Blinks, of Wellington, Fla., on Flim Flam, were in 10th and 11th place. (AP)</p>
