        <p>The Birmingham Royal Ballet has clearly won many American friends in its season at City Center. Cheers, mid-ballet applause and appreciative laughter greeted the company on Thursday night when it presented ''Jazz Triple,'' the second of two programs in this first American tour.</p>
        <p>There was talk in the audience of the exuberance of the dancers and of the choreographic style of David Bintley, the company director, who contributed two of the evening's three ballets. Many in the audience were charmed by the verbal give-and-take those in the first several rows enjoyed with musicians of the Royal Ballet Sinfonia and the program's conductor, Paul Murphy. And the stage was awash with bright, elaborate-looking costumes and sets.</p>

        <p>The Birmingham Royal Ballet has clearly won many American friends in its season at City Center. Cheers, mid-ballet applause and appreciative laughter greeted the company on Thursday night when it presented ''Jazz Triple,'' the second of two programs in this first American tour.</p>
        <p>There was talk in the audience of the exuberance of the dancers and of the choreographic style of David Bintley, the company director, who contributed two of the evening's three ballets. Many in the audience were charmed by the verbal give-and-take those in the first several rows enjoyed with musicians of the Royal Ballet Sinfonia and the program's conductor, Paul Murphy. And the stage was awash with bright, elaborate-looking costumes and sets.</p>
        <p>But the program left some dance aficionados wanting more in ways that the company could not have intended. Founded in 1946 as a touring adjunct to the Sadler's Wells Ballet (now the Royal Ballet), the troupe has a distinctive look and style that were revealed only in glimpses of elegant body line, classically pure dancing and intense dramatic conviction. At the same time the dancers blend attractiveness and a look of practical-minded solidity in a way that suggests they would be great fun over beers in a local pub.</p>
        <p>It is understandable that Mr. Bintley, a leading choreographer in England but relatively unknown here, would want to showcase his own work in this debut. Certainly the two pieces he presented, both set to music by Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, must have looked like a good fit with George Balanchine's ''Slaughter on 10th Avenue,'' which opened this jazz program. But Mr. Bintley's 1999 ''Shakespeare Suite'' and 1996 ''Nutcracker Sweeties'' were nearly indistinguishable in several ways. The most interesting piece was the Balanchine ballet, choreographed for the Broadway musical ''On Your Toes'' and now a New York City Ballet staple.</p>
        <p>One of the interests of ''Slaughter on 10th Avenue'' was how different it looked from the cheerful near-cartoon, giddy yet soulful, with which New Yorkers are familiar. Given that it was taught to the troupe by the admired Balanchine re-stager Susan Hendl, that look was probably mostly the effect of Kate Ford's new set and stylized costumes.</p>
        <p>The Birmingham dancers gave the ballet a smooth, low-key Broadway look rather than the crispness of the City Ballet or the thrust of much jazz dancing. David Justin was a boyish, amiable young Hoofer. Monica Zamora was fascinating as the Striptease Girl, looking more like a brassy Liliane Montevecchi than a vulnerable Suzanne Farrell in her black bodystocking, but gradually revealing a more poignant warmth.</p>
        <p>The lead cast was completed by Jonathan Payn as the jealous Morosine, Dominic Antonucci as the Gangster, Lee Fisher as the Big Boss and Samuel Armstrong and Timothy Cross as creepy Bartenders. James Grundy, Christopher Larsen and Toby Norman-Wright gave the Policemen's trio an antic spin.</p>
        <p>There is much fun to be had in figuring out which character is which in the vignettes that make up ''The Shakespeare Suite.'' Robert Parker's Hamlet gives himself away with his indecisive pacing and head-tapping. The deliciously pugnacious Carol-Anne Miller, a pint-size bride in high-top sneakers, is immediately recognizable as Kate and Mr. Antonucci is an amusingly feckless Petruchio. The next segment mystified most, but the program disclosed that Ms. Zamora was playing Lady Anne to Kevin O'Hare's suavely limping Richard III.</p>
        <p>An extended push-pull duet for Catherine Batcheller and Wolfgang Stollwitzer as Lady Macbeth and her hapless husband, suggested that Mr. Bintley had too literal a streak in him. One missed, over all, the kind of witty commentary on styles that animated a jivey duet for a natty Bottom, danced by Mr. Justin, and Ambra Vallo who looked suspiciously like a sendup of several Titanias in Sir Frederick Ashton's ''Dream.''</p>
        <p>It was back to choreographically bland business, however, with the closing dances for an endlessly cruel Othello and his Desdemona, danced by Joseph Cipolla and Victoria Marr, and a generic Romeo and Juliet, played by Tiit Helimets and Leticia Muller. Best of all was Colin Skinner's lush, heart-rending saxophone solo in Ellington's ''Star-Crossed Lovers,'' to which the second duet was danced.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bintley's ideas tend to be more interesting than his choreography. Two Bintley jazz pieces set to rather similar scores by the same composers may have been just too much. ''The Nutcracker Sweeties'' seemed as impoverished imaginatively as the Ellington-Strayhorn re-envisioning of Tchaikovsky to which the ballet was set. There were flashes of wit and choreographic invention and commentary, but they emerged only fitfully. Busy, mostly mystifying costumes by Jasper Conran and set elements by Peter J. Davison overwhelmed the suite of meager dances that alluded, too often unintelligibly, to aspects of the ballet classic.</p>
        <p>Still, the Birmingham company is immensely likable. May it soon return, with more inspired programming. For the moment it performs  through tomorrow at City Center and then moves to Chicago.</p>
