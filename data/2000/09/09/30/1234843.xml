        <p>The cars stretched down the street outside the bigger-than-average tract house in the San Fernando Valley suburb of Northridge, and the sound of ''Misty'' drifted from speakers in the backyard.</p>
        <p>Inside, the famous Cali-Thai chef, Tommy Tang, was cooking lunch. And a sign at the edge of the scrubby brown hillside warned, ''Caution: Rattlesnakes.''</p>
        <p>It was a world away from Westchester County, but Hillary Rodham Clinton was making the scene Thursday at the home of Rehman Jinnah, an entrepreneur. This was one of six stops on Mrs. Clinton's latest California fund-raising tour, which also featured a bagels-and-lox breakfast with the producer of ''Pulp Fiction,'' dinner with the billionaire financier Marvin Davis, and today, a tea with Cher in a posh beach-side hotel.</p>
        <p>Less than a week after an agreement with her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, to restrict the use of the unregulated party campaign funds known as soft money, Mrs. Clinton was back on the money trail in ZIP code 90210 and its affluent environs, raising what her aides said was about $450,000 in hard money for her own campaign, plus an unspecified amount of hard and soft money for the Democratic Party's Senate campaign committee.</p>
        <p>Her campaign went out of its way not to publicize the events, and aides said the appearances had been scheduled well before the agreement with the Lazio campaign to forswear the use of soft money for television campaign advertising.</p>
        <p>''I'm mostly raising money for my own campaign,'' Mrs. Clinton said outside the Jinnahs' house, where she posed for pictures beside a miniature Statue of Liberty. ''But I'm, you know, fulfilling the obligations that I set. If there are people who want to make contributions to the Democratic Party, you know, I think until we have total campaign finance reform, that's appropriate.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, referred questions about the amount of soft money raised on this trip to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in Washington. But a spokesman there, David DiMartino, said it was the Clinton campaign that set such goals, and the committee did not know the amounts.</p>
        <p>The Clinton-Lazio agreement allows the continued use of soft money for voter drives and direct mail, and does not bar the candidates from raising money to help other candidates in their parties. Mrs. Clinton's aides defended her efforts here, even as they attacked Mr. Lazio's plan to appear at a New York State Republican Party soft-money fund-raiser next month where the top ticket costs $100,000, after he pledged not to raise or spend soft money for his campaign.</p>
        <p>''Rick Lazio is a soft-money hypocrite,'' said Mr. Wolfson. ''He repeatedly told New Yorkers that he wasn't raising or spending soft money. Now New Yorkers know that was a lie. Mr. Lazio's 11th-hour election-year conversion to reform is nothing more than a pathetic fraud.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, campaigning today in Watertown, N.Y., insisted that he, too, was merely operating under the agreed-upon rules. He said he would have preferred a total ban on soft money, which Mrs. Clinton resisted.</p>
        <p>''If you begin to look at the difference between what we're referring to here and the fact that the Clinton campaign has raised and spent over $10 million in soft money and used that money to air commercials attacking my record, I think that's the real story here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In fact, several local Democratic campaign operatives here, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said  the Clinton campaign had sent out the word that it would prefer to raise hard money on this trip, to help counter Mr. Lazio's surprisingly large war chest. He had $10.2 million in cash on hand, compared with her  $7.1 million, as of Aug. 23. But they said that many potential donors had already contributed the maximum allowed to Mrs. Clinton's campaign.</p>
        <p>By law, individuals may give up to $2,000 -- $1,000 in a primary and $1,000 in a general election -- directly to candidates for the United States Senate, and up to $20,000 to party campaign committees in so-called hard money. They can also give an unlimited amount of soft money.</p>
        <p>Like President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton has been extraordinarily successful in raising money in California, with percentages more akin to those of a candidate for national office than for a Senate seat in a single state.</p>
        <p>A review of her contributions from individual donors through June 30 showed that about 40 percent came from New Yorkers, and 16 percent from Californians. The California figure is more than five times the percentage she has raised from residents of either New Jersey or Connecticut. By contrast, two years ago, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York raised just 4 percent of his individual contributions from Californians, with three-quarters coming from New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>If the soft money she has raised for the Democratic Party -- most of which gets spent in New York -- were counted, California's tally would be even higher.</p>
        <p>On this trip, Mrs. Clinton relied on the hospitality of a diverse group, from Mr. Jinnah, an investor in the international exposition business, to Cher, who entertained at a fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton during the Democratic National Convention last month.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also attended a reception on Thursday at the Beverly Hills home of Morris Pynoos, a businessman who was an overnight guest at the White House before the 1996 presidential campaign, and a lunch today at the home of Marc Nathanson, a cable television executive whom Mr. Clinton appointed chairman of the board that oversees the Voice of America.</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, her hosts were Mr. Davis and his wife, Barbara, who held a $5,000-a-couple dinner in their home. The Davises are among the leading socialites of Beverly Hills, and sponsors of the Carousel of Hope charity ball for juvenile diabetes, at which Mr. Clinton is to appear next month.</p>
        <p>Thursday morning, Mrs. Clinton was the guest of honor at ''a good New York Jewish breakfast,'' in the words of her host, Lawrence Bender. Mr. Bender, who was born in the Bronx, has produced movies including ''Pulp Fiction,'' ''Anna and the King'' and ''Good Will Hunting,'' which he screened for the Clintons at Camp David.</p>
        <p>''I'm a New Yorker, you know, even though I live here,'' Mr. Bender said, ''so the things she stands for, like education, the environment, gun safety and women's right to choose, those are all very important to me.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''I don't think I'm supposed to give details,'' of the number of guests or the amount raised at the breakfast.</p>
