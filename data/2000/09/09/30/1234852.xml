        <p>Perhaps the main intrigue involving the Mets last night came a little more than an hour before the start of the game with Montreal, when Benny Agbayani and Derek Bell stepped into the batting cage at Shea Stadium and came out healthy and ready to play this weekend. It was the lone clue that the Mets would supply as to just who would be participating when their division series begins next Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The game itself lost what little allure it held when the Mets piled on six runs in the first inning on the way to an 11-2 victory over the Expos, making Mike Hampton's start little more than a bullpen work session.</p>
        <p>It is Hampton's next start that holds a bit of mystery because the Mets have not disclosed who will be the starting pitcher when the playoffs open.</p>
        <p>While Hampton joined the Mets this season to be the ace of the staff, Al Leiter did not surrender the title so easily. Their performances make the decision a tough one for Manager Bobby Valentine and his staff, but the two left-handers have maintained that they have lost little sleep wondering about their place.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't care less,'' said Leiter, who has been lifted from his scheduled start tomorrow. ''As long as I get to pitch.''</p>
        <p>Hampton stated his case in the easiest of manners, hurling five shutout innings and making only 64 pitches before calling it a night with a 10-run lead against the Expos. He earned his 15th victory, allowing just three hits and one walk while striking out four, and he got more run support in the first two innings than he had received in a five-game stretch earlier this month.</p>
        <p>Montreal's starter, Mike Thurman, surrendered an infield hit to the leadoff batter Timo Perez, then walked the next three batters, resulting in a Mets' run.</p>
        <p>An infield hit by Robin Ventura brought in a second run, and then, on a 2-1 pitch, Jay Payton crushed his first career grand slam. The Mets tagged on four more runs in the second inning, capped by Ventura's two-run homer.</p>
        <p>''We want to get through this where we have good health, physically and mentally, and move forward,'' Valentine said. ''Mike got a good workout in. He threw all his pitches, had his aggressiveness and command, didn't get extended and he got another win. Those things are good.''</p>
        <p>Before the game, the Mets held a meeting, with Valentine, his coaching staff, and General Manager Steve Phillips sorting through the decision-making process. They debated the merits of major questions such as, ''Who will start Game 1?'' and potentially minor ones, such as, ''Who will be the 25th man on the roster?'' or, ''Do we keep nine, 10 or 11 pitchers?''</p>
        <p>While the hourlong session settled the questions, the Mets are not ready to make their findings public. ''We talked about how many pitchers, nine, 10 or 11,'' Phillips said. ''We have an idea about what we'd do there. We have an idea about how to line up the starting pitching, but it's subject to revision. We want to wait and see who we're playing to help make some of those decisions.''</p>
        <p>While the best news of the day for the Mets was that Agbayani and Bell were believed to be ready for the playoffs, the Mets still had to wait to see who they would be facing as the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals go to the wire to see who has the better record.</p>
        <p>Either matchup would seem to have little effect on whether the Mets would throw Leiter or Hampton in Game 1, making either available to start a potential fifth game. Leiter would seem to make sense because he is skipping his start tomorrow and last started last Tuesday against Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''Whether I pitch Wednesday or Thursday, I've always been a guy who enjoys having the extra day or two,'' Leiter said. ''I would still throw Sunday, no matter what. I think the way I pitch, I'm kind of a max effort guy. I have a tendency to want the extra rest and then I feel stronger.''</p>
        <p>Leiter threw a two-hit shutout in his only outing against the Giants this season, on Aug. 13. Against St. Louis, he won his only start, a 3-2 decision on July 28. But Hampton also threw seven innings without allowing an earned run in his last start against the Giants and allowed just four runs in 16 innings against the Cardinals this season.</p>
        <p>Hampton finished the season at 15-10 with a 3.14 earned run average, while Leiter boasts a 16-8 record with a 3.20 E.R.A. The Giants were 17-20 against left-handers this season, and the Cardinals were 17-22.</p>
        <p>''That's all part of it, but statistics aren't necessarily the end-all either,'' Phillips said. He added that the pitchers were not consulted for a preference.</p>
        <p>''They may have shared their thoughts with the coaches, but they were not at the lunch. You take into account player's strengths, weaknesses, preferences, but you have to do what you think is right for the team. Sometimes that is in accord with the player's opinions and sometimes it's not.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>In addition to batting practice, BENNY AGBAYANI did agility drills and believed he would be ready to play. ''I felt good today,'' said Agbayani, who strained his right hamstring. ''I'm going to run the bases tomorrow, do what I need to do to see if it's 100 percent. And if it is, then I'll be able to play.''</p>
        <p>The grand slam by JAY PAYTON was the Mets' eighth of the season, matching the team record set last year. It was also the 12th surrendered by Montreal pitchers, setting a National League record.</p>
