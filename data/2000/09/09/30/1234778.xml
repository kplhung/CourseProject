        <p>I entered the candidate's hotel suite in the mid-afternoon. The room was silent. As I quietly walked over to a table to retrieve some files we had been using as preparation for that evening's televised presidential debate, the candidate's sister and her small child entered the room, laughing and talking. ''What the . . . ?'' John Kennedy called out, indignant at being roused from sleep. Later I was to marvel that he had been taking a nap only hours before what we now know to have been the most important moment of his campaign for the presidency in 1960.</p>
        <p>We staffers had never prepared for such a debate before. But neither had anyone else: This was the first.</p>
        <p>Since Kennedy was already familiar with the issues after years in the Senate and months of primaries, we tried to compress each issue -- health insurance, Cuba, education -- down to the most relevant and telling facts. In practice sessions, Kennedy would read from cards we had prepared, occasionally practicing the language he planned to use. Sometimes he would ask questions that sent us rushing off for additional research.</p>
        <p>No one ''played'' Richard Nixon. (Who could?) Instead, we had a thick bound volume we called the ''Nixopedia'' that contained, we hoped, everything the vice president had ever said or done over his already long political career. We used this to anticipate his answers or find contradictions between his past and present positions.</p>
        <p>Then, late in the afternoon, as Kennedy reclined on the bed, we stood, cards in hand, and posed some last-minute questions, suggesting modifications to answers. Gradually Bobby Kennedy and a few other relatives joined us, along with the ''television adviser,'' who asked the candidate if he wanted to wear makeup. ''I don't think so,'' Kennedy answered. Then he went into the bathroom, where he patted talcum on his cheeks, and left for the studio where Nixon and the American presidency awaited.</p>
        <p>Later, some commentators would argue about the debate's winner. But we had no doubts. The next day's crowds along the campaign trail doubled, even tripled. There was a new level of intensity. Kennedy had become a celebrity. And even though he would begin to slip in the closing weeks of the campaign, he retained just enough of the edge given him by that first debate to win the election.</p>
        <p>It wasn't about the issues. As Kennedy would say later in the campaign, when I brought him an ''issue'' speech I'd prepared, ''Remember, Dick, I don't want to make policy, I want to make votes.''</p>
        <p>That same desire is what will animate George W. Bush and Al Gore when they face off on Tuesday in Boston: not to make debating points, win arguments or uncover contradictions, but to make votes. That is why we won't know the winner of the debate until Election Day. Columnists will express opinions, but the outcome of a debate depends on something larger -- something not susceptible to logical analysis.</p>
        <p>Every quadrennial set of debates, like every presidential campaign, is different from the ones that have gone before. The people are different, the problems are different, the country is different. There are, however, a few lasting verities.</p>
        <p>Among them is that preparation is everything. This is not because it's important to show that a candidate is better informed or ''smarter'' than his opponent; there is no opportunity to demonstrate this, at least if both men are prepared. Instead, a candidate rehearses answers so he can make his points in a compressed, forceful and occasionally humorous fashion. You don't need to be fast on your feet if you've already run the race.</p>
        <p>Still, even though there is no reason to lose a debate on the issues, there will be a winner. He will be the candidate who better conveys the abilities needed to deal with problems of national concern, not who better conveys the particulars of policy. People can evaluate these qualities. They do so in daily life. So candidates have to dissolve apprehensions already present in the public mind: that Mr. Gore is stiff, for example, or that Mr. Bush is a lightweight.</p>
        <p>Back in 1960, Nixon's biggest advantage -- and he made it a crucial issue in his campaign -- was Kennedy's youth and inexperience. Simply by holding his own against the wily statesman, Kennedy took those issues away from the Republicans.</p>
        <p>Eight years later, when Bobby Kennedy debated Eugene McCarthy in the Democratic primary debates, their very closeness on the issues sent the really important message: that the contest was not between the old-style politics (Kennedy) and the new (McCarthy). Homing in on voters' apprehensions about this and dispelling the distinction with his vigorous debating style, Kennedy saved victory in the California primary.</p>
        <p>This year's election is shaping up as the closest since 1960, if the polls are to be believed. In such a tight race the debates -- particularly the first one -- may be decisive. It is unlikely that either candidate will make a televised error on the issues -- as when, say, Gerald Ford seemed to deny Soviet control of Eastern Europe. In any case, such misstatements are of more concern to the media than to the public.</p>
        <p>The most important issue for the coming debates is whether Mr. Bush can erode the perception, widespread but only tentatively held, that Mr. Gore is a man of greater competence and command. If Mr. Bush does his homework, and if he holds his own on the dais, he may accomplish that.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, if you want to know who won the debates, ignore the ratings of the commentators. They are only evaluating the words, while the rest of the country is listening to the music.</p>
