        <p>Robert W. Blanchette, a former head of the Federal Railroad Administration and a former chief executive of the Penn Central Transportation Company, died Monday at Georgetown Hospital in Washington. He was 68 and lived in Bethesda, Md.</p>
        <p>He died after an extended illness, said a friend, John DePodesta.</p>
        <p>As administrator of the railroad agency from 1981 to 1983, Mr. Blanchette was in the forefront of the Reagan Administration's plan to take the government out of the railroad business.</p>
        <p>The effort led to deep cuts in federal spending on Amtrak, the passenger operation, and a plan to end federal sponsorship of Conrail, the freight company, and sell its components to private industry.</p>
        <p>Earlier, from 1970 to 1978, he had an important role in the affairs of Penn Central, after its 1970 bankruptcy, then the biggest corporate bankruptcy in American history.</p>
        <p>In 1970, a judge named him counsel to the court-appointed trustees of the company. He went on be a trustee and then chairman of the board. He was chief executive of the company from 1975 to 1978, when a plan to restructure it received court approval.</p>
        <p>In 1969 and 1970, he was the executive director, chosen by the railroad industry, of America's Sound Transportation Review Organization, which recommended ways to enhance the industry's financial health.</p>
        <p>From 1963 to 1968, he was general counsel of the New Haven Railroad, which was absorbed by Penn Central.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blanchette was born in New Haven and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Connecticut and a law degree cum laude from Yale, where he was editor in chief of The Yale Law Journal. He served as an Air Force lieutenant in France from 1958 to 1960.</p>
        <p>After stepping down from the Federal Railroad Administration, he was a vice president and general counsel of the Association of American Railroads from 1990 until he retired in 1997.</p>
        <p>He was also a trustee of Assumption College in Worcester, Mass.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blanchette is survived by his wife, the former Marna Madelaire Nielsen, whom he married in 1969; a son, Pierre deJordy Blanchette of Ossining, N.Y.; and a daughter, Valerie Claude Blanchette of Bethesda.</p>
