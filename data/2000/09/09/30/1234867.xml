        <p>They are the Yankees. Proud and feisty, talented and competitive, they are a team that expects greatness and a team that has achieved it by securing three of the last four World Series titles. They are the Yankees. That phrase is usually enough to describe a team that succeeds.</p>

        <p>They are the Yankees. Proud and feisty, talented and competitive, they are a team that expects greatness and a team that has achieved it by securing three of the last four World Series titles. They are the Yankees. That phrase is usually enough to describe a team that succeeds.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees have not looked like the Yankees usually do as this season grinds through a revealing September to a merciless conclusion. The Yankees have been complacent, a team plodding toward the postseason while the regular season unfolds and they unravel. Did anyone ever speculate that Joe Torre would want to switch places with Bobby Valentine in late September? Yesterday afternoon, Torre would have.</p>
        <p>Once upon a time, maybe three weeks ago, the Yankees seemed dangerous and their pursuit of a third straight championship was not doubted. They were waiting for their injuries to heal, their offense to explode and their relievers to resurrect themselves. It sounded simple because, after all, they are the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Yankees limped into Camden Yards as an embarrassed team last night and those queasy feelings remained as the Orioles thumped Andy Pettitte, 13-2, and shoved them to their 13th loss in the last 16 games. But the inferior Red Sox, who were alive only because the Yankees have played dead, succumbed to the Devil Rays, 8-6.</p>
        <p>So the Yankees finally clinched the American League East on a night when their personal collapse continued. The Champagne could have remained untouched, but Torre realized that the Yankees had suffered long enough. He held a meeting after the coupling of a dreary loss and a clinching and implored the Yankees to celebrate the season by splashing and spraying the bubbly.</p>
        <p>''We're not celebrating for the last two weeks,'' said Derek Jeter. ''We're celebrating something we've worked on since the middle of February.''</p>
        <p>There were about a dozen reporters around Torre in the third-base dugout before the game when he said: ''Every year has its own story. This has been the strangest in five years. Don't you think?''</p>
        <p>Everyone nodded. No doubt it has been strange and that was before the Orioles scored 10 runs in the second inning to instantly deprive Pettitte of his 20th victory.</p>
        <p>This was not the first time the Yankees were vulnerable this year. It was just the most noticeable one. The Yankees were an ordinary team for huge chunks of the season, but the Red Sox and the Blue Jays never challenged them. Maybe first place came too easily for the Yankees, who went to sleep and waited for the postseason. Torre met with his players before the game and reminded them of who they are. Is this who the Yankees are?</p>
        <p>''I don't think we've thrown our gloves on the field and expected to win,'' said Bernie Williams, which is how it often looked.</p>
        <p>Last week, Torre said the Yankees only needed four days to get crisp for the postseason. With that approach botched, Torre claimed that he did not think this slump would carry over. That is a curious thought. How could this stretch not have an impact on the Yankees?</p>
        <p>Pettitte said, ''I think it's going to be tougher than in year's past'' to forget the sluggish play leading to the postseason.</p>
        <p>The Yankees still have three dominant starters in Orlando Hernandez, Roger Clemens and Pettitte, plus a superb closer in Mariano Rivera and a sturdy nucleus of Williams, Jeter, David Justice and Jorge Posada. They have won 22 of their last 25 postseason games.</p>
        <p>But these Yankees are also perplexing because they are starved for runs and they are desperate for middle relief. Paul O'Neill has one extra-base hit since Sept. 6, Scott Brosius has no runs batted in over the last 17 games, and Tino Martinez has not knocked in a run in 13 of the last 14 games. The bullpen has allowed 48 earned runs in the last 57 1/3 innings.</p>
        <p>Once feared, the Yankees might wind up with the worst record of the eight teams bound for the postseason. The Yankees have 87 victories, which is not an overwhelming number. Only four teams have won fewer than 90 games in a complete regular season and snared a title -- the 1926 Cardinals, 1945 Tigers, 1959 Dodgers and 1987 Twins -- so the Yankees, who cling to their history of success, could have history working against them.</p>
        <p>They are the Yankees. But, this season, being the Yankees might be the reason for their incredible plunge. Being the Yankees, these Yankees, might be the reason they do not win a third straight championship. Because they are the Yankees, these flawed Yankees.</p>
