        <p>Two of the oldest clubs in New York City are combining this weekend. In the 70's, there was the Colony, on the Upper West Side, and the Colony East in Midtown. The first became the Manhattan Club and the second the Beverly Club. The proprietor of the Beverly, Joan Dziekanski, recently moved to the City Club, 50 West 54th Street, and starting tomorrow, the Beverly will become part of the Manhattan at 27 West 72nd Street.</p>
        <p>Dziekanski and Lydia Galton were North-South on the diagramed deal  recently at the City Club, and were happy with their result. With a total of 12 high-card points, they bid and made a doubled game when their opponents could have made a slam.</p>

        <p>Two of the oldest clubs in New York City are combining this weekend. In the 70's, there was the Colony, on the Upper West Side, and the Colony East in Midtown. The first became the Manhattan Club and the second the Beverly Club. The proprietor of the Beverly, Joan Dziekanski, recently moved to the City Club, 50 West 54th Street, and starting tomorrow, the Beverly will become part of the Manhattan at 27 West 72nd Street.</p>
        <p>Dziekanski and Lydia Galton were North-South on the diagramed deal  recently at the City Club, and were happy with their result. With a total of 12 high-card points, they bid and made a doubled game when their opponents could have made a slam.</p>
        <p>South showed both her suits, and North took the plunge in four spades. With a double fit, the lack of high cards was no obstacle. All the defense could take was three aces, and North-South scored 590.</p>
        <p>It is easy to see that East-West could have made 11 tricks in a heart contract, or 12 if East is the declarer and protected from a club lead. After trumps are drawn, a club can be discarded on the fifth round of diamonds. Six diamonds can be made similarly, with East as declarer.</p>
        <p>So what was wrong with the East-West bidding? The two-diamond bid after the two-club overcall was ambiguous. It was intended as a transfer, showing hearts, and was understood as such.</p>
        <p>The transfer should have worked brilliantly. It made it certain that hearts would be played from the desirable East position. But if two diamonds was understood as a transfer, East should have bid three hearts, showing a good heart fit and a maximum hand. That would no doubt have silenced South and the spade fit would have stayed hidden.</p>
        <p>As it was, West should have taken the opportunity to bid diamonds on the second round. If hearts had been shown by the transfer, there was no need to emphasize that suit. If East had known that his partner held length in both red suits, a bid of five hearts over four spades would have been clearly indicated. Even as it was, the double of four spades was a poor decision. A pass would have been forcing, indicating a willingness to continue to the five level.</p>
        <p>So East-West should certainly have bid five hearts, with five spades doubled down one the most likely of several possible outcomes.</p>
