        <p>In an 11th-hour attempt to rescue their $20 billion joint venture from rejection by European regulators, Time Warner and the EMI Group have offered to sell off EMI's Virgin record label to win approval, people close to the companies said today.</p>
        <p>It is by far the biggest compromise the companies have offered, and came one day after antitrust regulators at the European Commission had tentatively decided to prohibit the joint venture.</p>
        <p>It remains unclear whether the proposal would satisfy European concerns, which center on the fact that the joint venture would reduce the number of worldwide music distributors from five to four.</p>
        <p>But Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the commission, said officials had received new proposals and that they might reconvene a meeting between Mario Monti, the commissioner in charge of competition issues, and the national antitrust regulators from individual countries.</p>
        <p>At the very least, European officials say it is now extremely unlikely that the commission will reach a final decision on either the EMI deal or the much bigger but related merger between Time Warner and America Online.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, according to European officials, Mr. Monti recommended to the national regulators that the commission block the deal between Time Warner and EMI but approve the merger between Time Warner and America Online.</p>
        <p>European officials had been hoping that Time Warner would simply abandon the EMI deal, and they have let it be known that the merger with America Online would be much easier to approve if Time Warner were not trying to expand its grip over the worldwide music business.</p>
        <p>Selling Virgin would be a dramatic overture to the regulators. Virgin is one of EMI's most important music companies and has rights over a range of music from the Rolling Stones and David Bowie to younger stars like Robbie Williams, the Vengaboys and the Spice Girls.</p>
        <p>The deadline for a decision on the EMI deal is Oct. 18 and the deadline for the AOL merger is Oct. 24.</p>
