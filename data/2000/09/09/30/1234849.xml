        <p>White House and Congressional negotiators agreed today on a plan to set aside $12 billion over six years for a sweeping federal land conservation effort.</p>
        <p>White House officials and lawmakers who cobbled together the agreement after two years of debate said the money would be fenced off in a special conservation account, similar to the Highway Trust Fund, intended to assure a steady, if not completely guaranteed, flow of money for protecting sensitive lands.</p>
        <p>The money would be used for activities like buying land for national parks and national monuments, grants to cities for parks and green space, buying and maintaining historic sites like Civil War battlefields, and establishing wildlife refuges.</p>
        <p>Under the new program, federal spending on conservation would more than double in the next fiscal year, to $1.6 billion from the $742 million allocated in the past 12 months. The amount would grow to $2.4 billion by the 2006 fiscal year.</p>
        <p>''This is, by far, the greatest increase in conservation spending in the history of the country,'' said Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington, who helped negotiate the agreement.</p>
        <p>The compromise bill is a scaled-back version of a proposal pushed by President Clinton and by environmentalists that would have guaranteed $45 billion for conservation efforts over the next 15 years. That measure, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, has been stalled in the Senate.</p>
        <p>The legislation announced today would require that the money be used only for conservation. In the past, money allocated to programs like the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund could, and frequently was, used for other purposes.</p>
        <p>Congress would still have to act each year before the money would be spent on specific projects. But if Congress decided not to spend the amount annually placed in the fund, the money would remain in the account and could be allocated the next year. White House officials and some lawmakers said the popularity of conservation programs would all but guarantee that the money would be spent every year.</p>
        <p>''I'm quite confident that this regime is one that will last for a long time,'' said George Frampton, chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, a White House agency. ''I think it's going to be very popular. I think it's going to work.''</p>
        <p>The program would be established under an $18.8 billion spending bill that finances the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency and related agencies. The compromise worked out by Congressional and White House negotiators will be voted on by the House early next week and the Senate soon thereafter.</p>
        <p>White House officials said they hoped the accord reached today would propel the effort to reach agreement on the remaining spending bills that must be enacted to keep the government functioning.</p>
        <p>''In the broader sense, the way we engaged on the Interior bill reflects a different approach than we saw from Congress through most of the last month,'' Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said. ''For most of last month we've been running from meeting to meeting without any sense that there was any direction. This Interior bill was the first time we saw a willingness to compromise.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lew said there would probably be a meeting next week between White House officials and Congressional negotiators. The administration would like the discussions to center on the mammoth spending measure that finances government labor, health and education programs, traditionally one of the most contentious spending bills.</p>
        <p>Reaction among environmental advocates to the deal on the Interior bill was mixed. Some groups supported the idea of the conservation fund, but said they could not endorse it without seeing the legislation's fine print.</p>
        <p>''This is a big deal,'' said Anna Aurilio, legislative director for U.S. PIRG, the Washington lobbying office for state Public Interest Research Groups. ''This is a very big deal, but the devil is in the details.''</p>
        <p>Many environmental groups had favored the proposed $45 billion conservation program, which sketched out how much money would be allocated to federal and state conservation programs over the next 15 years.</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists felt that, in addition to its larger size, it was  preferable because it guaranteed specific amounts for specific programs, rather than leaving it to Congress.</p>
        <p>''The great challenge is to ensure that we have permanent funding,'' said Tom Cassidy, senior policy advisor at The Nature Conservancy, an environmental group. ''From what I've seen thus far, it does not seem that we have that in the proposal that was reached today.''</p>
        <p>Several lawmakers had threatened to filibuster the bigger bill in the Senate. Among the reasons for their opposition is that the bill would take away the ability of Congress to channel money to specific projects. The compromise reached today would set up seven broad accounts in the conservation fund and allocate a specific sum that could be spent in each.</p>
        <p>The compromise also left it up to the appropriations committees to determine how the money in each account would be spent.</p>
