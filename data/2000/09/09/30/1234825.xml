        <p>From his corner ringside perch tonight, the United States boxing coach, Tom Mustin, watched the first round unfold between his fighter, Ricardo Williams Jr., and Cuba's powerful Diogenes Luna and had just one thought: we're in trouble.</p>

        <p>From his corner ringside perch tonight, the United States boxing coach, Tom Mustin, watched the first round unfold between his fighter, Ricardo Williams Jr., and Cuba's powerful Diogenes Luna and had just one thought: we're in trouble.</p>
        <p>Inside the ring, Williams had already tested the prefight plan and come to a similar conclusion. ''I tried to counterpunch over his right hand like we talked about,'' Williams said afterward. ''He ducked it and threw a quick right that hit me right in the forehead. I said to myself, 'It's going to be a long night.'</p>
        <p>''The plan was to stick and move; don't slug it out. But I knew right then my only chance was going toe-to-toe for four rounds.''</p>
        <p>Williams willingly took on the hardy, more experienced Luna, who had knocked out his previous opponent, but by the midpoint of their semifinal, things weren't looking much better for the American. Williams, a 139-pound light welterweight from Cincinnati, had a sore left cheekbone and was behind in the official scoring by 6 points.</p>
        <p>It was at this juncture that the referee separated the fighters after a clinch. Williams dropped his hands because the referee had shouted to stop punching. That's when Luna hit Williams on the side of the head. Luna got a warning.</p>
        <p>Williams said: ''I got mad.''</p>
        <p>What followed was the most spirited round and a half of the 2000 Olympic boxing tournament in what became the most vigorous and entertaining fight of the 286 fought so far in Sydney.</p>
        <p>With a merciless torrent of lefts and rights, Williams backed Luna onto the ropes, then pounded him into a corner, outscoring the Cuban by 16-8 for the remainder of the third round to take the points lead. Then, in an extraordinary final round, with both exhausted fighters winging dozens of power punches, Williams and Luna traded the lead with every exchange. Williams rallied last, a left and a right put him ahead, and he held on to win on points, 42-41.</p>
        <p>The total of punches scored, 83, was 33 more than in any other bout in these Olympics.</p>
        <p>Williams will fight Mahamadkadyz Abdullaev of Uzbekistan for the gold medal Sunday. Joining Williams in the gold medal round today was the American featherweight Ricardo Juarez, who defeated Kamil Dzamalutdinov of Russia on points, 23-12. The United States light middleweight Jermain Taylor was defeated by Yermakhan Ibraimov of Kazakhstan, 29-14.</p>
        <p>Ibraimov was too determined for Taylor, who for the first time in the Olympics looked sluggish. Taylor will still receive a bronze medal.</p>
        <p>Juarez, who will also face a Kazakh fighter, Bekzat Sattarkhanov, in the finals, is a reigning world champion and was expected to get to the gold medal round. Juarez is the team's smartest fighter, its most disciplined and tenacious. He has won 68 consecutive bouts and, among his teammates, should make the most immediate impact as a professional.</p>
        <p>But Williams, 19, was not considered a top American medal contender in part because he had a history of undertraining. And he was hardly favored against Luna, especially after Luna won his quarterfinal fight with a one-punch knockout. ''I had to dig deep in a lot of ways,'' Williams said.</p>
        <p>Mustin has called Williams the most talented American fighter on the team because of his hand-eye coordination and foot speed. But his training habits, while adequate, at one time were not exceptional. That has changed.</p>
        <p>''I figured I had talent and I could get by with that,'' Williams said today. ''But the other guys had talent and determination. I had to fix that.''</p>
        <p>It was a loss in last year's world championships to Abdullaev, whom he will face again for the gold, which was the turning point for Williams. Eleven years earlier, his father, Ricardo Sr., who had a brief professional boxing career, had taken his son to the gym to learn to fight.</p>
        <p>''I had three sisters,'' Ricardo Jr. said. ''They didn't want me playing with Barbie dolls all the time. My dad taught me the sport, and I liked it.''</p>
        <p>But last year, the father, a part-time artist and a full-time painter for the Cincinnati housing authority, took the son aside and suggested he make the most of his ring skills. ''This is an important time in my life,'' Ricardo Jr. said. ''It was time to see just how much I could make of my boxing. It was conditioning and ring work.''</p>
        <p>Williams has charged through the Olympic tournament, with no performance more convincing than tonight's. Luna and Williams were trading bombs in the middle of the ring and on the ropes.</p>
        <p>Or as Mustin said: ''That was no boxing match. They were tossing some luggage out there.''</p>
        <p>In the fight's final seconds, Williams finally thought the extra work was going to pay off. He heard his father yelling from his ringside seat.</p>
        <p>''He was yelling, 'Stick and move,' '' Williams said. ''The original plan. He probably knew I was ahead.''</p>
        <p>With 15 seconds to go, Williams had a 1-point lead.</p>
        <p>''I got my track shoes on,'' Williams said. ''I think I would have beat Michael Johnson late in that round.''</p>
        <p>Luna threw a left hand with six seconds left that Williams danced away from, though it grazed his face. It was the last punch in the fight of the tournament. But the judges, perhaps with fatigue in their fingers, did not score it as a landed punch. Williams had won.</p>
        <p>So it is that the two Ricardos -- Williams and Juarez -- are the last gold medal hopes for the Americans. No United States boxing team has failed to win at least one gold medal since 1948.</p>
        <p>''I'm relieved that we've got two guys left,'' Mustin said. ''I sure don't want to be the first coach not to win one in 52 years.''</p>
        <p>But the day's events, especially Williams's surprising and heroic victory, had bolstered Mustin.</p>
        <p>''I'm pretty lucky to be going to war with these two guys,'' he said.</p>
