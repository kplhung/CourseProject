        <p>NAGASHIMA-Hideo, M.D. The President and Board of Trustees of Montefiore Medical Center and the entire Montefiore community are deeply saddened by the death of Hideo Nagashima, M.D. An esteemed member of our Department of Anesthesiology for more than 4 decades and director of Anesthesiology Research, Dr. Nagashima was highly regarded as a pioneer in the use of anesthesia during open heart surgery. A revered teacher, he founded a fellowship program which for 30 years trained many of the leaders of academic and anethesiology in Japan. Dr. Nagashima will be remembered by his colleagues, students, patients and friends as a man of warmth and grace who fulfilled the highest tenets of medicine. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to his wife, Sachiko; his sons, Robert, Hidalgo and Richard, his grandchildren and entire family. Spencer Foreman, M.D., President Jay B. Langner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center</p>
