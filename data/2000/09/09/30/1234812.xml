        <p>HOLY DAYS</p>
        <p>TIME OFF FOR OBSERVANCE -- In the home stretch of the presidential contest, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut is leaving the campaign trail for several days to observe the Jewish High Holy Days. This weekend is Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year, with observances beginning at sunset on Friday and lasting until sunset on Sunday. Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, begins at sundown on Oct. 8 and ends 24 hours later. Sukkot, which marks the fall harvest, is observed on Oct. 14 and 15. A week later, on Oct. 22, is Simchat Torah, the day on which the annual reading of the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, is completed and begun again. It starts the day after the Sabbath, beginning at sundown on Saturday. Mr. Lieberman, the first Jew on a major party's national ticket, already misses campaigning one day a week because he observes the Sabbath, from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.</p>

        <p>POLITICS ON TV</p>
        <p>CBS STATIONS EXPAND COVERAGE -- Starting on Monday, 17 CBS television stations, including WCBS in New York and KCBS in Los Angeles, will devote five minutes each night to political coverage on their news programs, the network announced. In making the decision, CBS joined broadcasters like the Belo Corporation., Hearst Argyle Television and Bloomberg Business News in accepting the recommendation of a presidential commission that local stations set aside five minutes for political discourse each night in the 30 days before an election. CBS Television, whose president, Leslie Moonves, was a commission chairman, became the first major network to involve its stations. Under the plan, the network said, each station will produce five-minute segments each night from 5 p.m. to 11:35 p.m. that concentrate on local and national elections. In addition, the network has invited Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush to appear on the ''CBS Evening News'' for one-on-one interviews on election eve.</p>

        <p>THE SHTICK</p>
        <p>CHENEY ON COMEDY TRAIL -- Joseph I. Lieberman isn't the only candidate trying out a comedy routine. Dick Cheney offered up some jokes this week. ''Putting Al Gore in charge of campaign finance reform,'' Mr. Cheney told Republican senators and contributors at the Senate Majority Dinner, ''is a lot like putting Bill Clinton in charge of abstinence.'' Then he turned to oil. ''The vice president, lately, has especially gotten worked up about gasoline prices,'' he said. ''It bothered him to hear the other day that some people are having to pay more than two dollars a gallon. But he really got mad when he found out his dog is getting it for only a buck.'' Judging from the laughs, the crowd had followed the twists and turns of Mr. Gore, prescription drugs, his mother-in-law and his dog Shiloh.</p>

        <p>THE TRAVEL LOG</p>
        <p>The candidates ended the week with a debate about about how best to deal with high energy prices. But that debate was conducted across hundreds of miles. In a few days they will be standing side by side in Boston for the first of three debates. And this weekend, both will be practicing at their respective debate camps. Vice President Al Gore heads to Sarasota, Fla., with 13 ''regular folks'' in tow to watch him face off against an aide, Paul Begala, flashing a George W. Bush smile and Texas drawl, while Governor Bush will square off with his surrogate rival, Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, at the Bush ranch outside Crawford, Tex.</p>
        <p>The candidates are cutting back their public appearances for the next few weeks of debates, and the Travel Log will do likewise. Here are the stats:</p>
        <p>Length of the Official Day: Gore, 11 1/2 hours; Bush, 11 1/2 hours  States Visited: Gore, 2; Bush, 2  Events: Gore, 1; Bush, 1  Press Conferences/Press Availability: Gore, 0; Bush, 0  Press Interviews (Includes Newspaper and TV Interviews): Gore, 4; Bush, 3  Diners visited/unscheduled drop-bys: Gore, 0; Bush, 0  Debate preparation: Gore, 1 hour; Bush 4 hours  Debate Camp: Gore, Sarasota, Fla.; Bush, Crawford, Tex.  Main message: Gore, environment; Bush, energy independence</p>
