        <p>A rail tanker carrying more than 27,000 gallons of butane derailed near a residential neighborhood in Woodbridge, N.J., yesterday morning, prompting officials to evacuate 300 people from their homes as a precaution.</p>
        <p>Officials said none of the butane escaped and no one was hurt in the incident, which officials said occurred at 4:55 a.m.</p>
        <p>Residents were allowed back into the 163 houses that had been evacuated in the township's Sewaren section about four hours later, after Chief John Scarpa of the Woodbridge Fire Department declared the area safe. Most of the people went to friends' homes or to work, according to a statement from Mayor James E. McGreevey. A few took advantage of a temporary shelter set up by the Red Cross at Woodbridge High School.</p>
        <p>Human error was blamed for the derailment, which remained under investigation yesterday, said Robert Lipkind, a spokesman for Conrail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lipkind said the accident occurred as the tanker was being pushed along a spur that runs off the Chemical Coast Line through Essex, Union and Middlesex Counties.</p>
        <p>The train rolled over an automatic derailer designed to prevent rail cars from accidentally rolling back from the spur onto the main line. Mr. Lipkind said the train was moving at less than 10 miles per hour, with the tanker in the lead, and a member of the train crew was supposed to walk ahead to manually shut off the derailer.</p>
        <p>''For whatever the reason, the person who is supposed to do it did not do it,'' and the tanker derailed, Mr. Lipkind said. ''We need to find out why.''</p>
        <p>He said there was no damage to the track or the tanker, which was delivering the highly flammable liquid from Ontario to the Motiva distribution center in Woodbridge.</p>
        <p>The tanker was righted just before 9 a.m., and continued on to the Motiva center.</p>
        <p>New Jersey Transit trains do not use the Chemical Coast Line, which runs roughly parallel to the New Jersey Turnpike, and transit officials said commuter service was not affected.</p>
