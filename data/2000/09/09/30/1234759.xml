        <p>As Lydia DeLucca, the working class heroine of ''That's Life,'' Heather Paige Kent carries herself with the wary toughness of an attractive woman accustomed to deflecting leers.</p>
        <p>She's a 32-year-old bartender who, in the pilot episode of this new dramatic series, decides to break off her engagement to a lumpish local and return to college. Her family, working-class Italian-Americans living in New Jersey, finds this notion the ultimate in foolhardiness (''You want to find yourself, go to Mass,'' advises her father.)</p>
        <p>The premiere has the halting -- and perhaps limited -- charm of a little independent film, complete with black-and-white montages of Lydia's childhood, shot in slow motion. Determined Lydia will undoubtedly succeed in school, but will audiences want to watch her inevitable struggles with her family and her ex-fiance, continuing confrontations with the age and class differences between her and her fellow students, fights and flirtations with her professors? It's hard to predict the durability of these potential scenarios.</p>
        <p>Uncertainty abounds. Almost all the relationships and characters seem to be in flux, as if the show's creators haven't yet decided whether the tone should be realistic or caricature, poignant or farcical. It's hard to know how to react to Lydia's sentimental line: ''I'm the only person I know who's literally dreamed of cramming for an exam.''</p>
        <p>Still, there may be hope for a female character who knows how to fix her clunker of a car by sticking a pencil in the engine -- and without fuss, the way Lydia does. She's supported herself since she was 18, and she seems authentically grown-up, especially when she shows up on campus. When a boy in the college bookstore brags to her about his frugality at being able to hike three months through Europe on $500, she's impressed only that he could take so much time off and have that much cash to spend on a vacation.</p>
        <p>But to her family she is still a girl. She may have her own apartment, but she returns to her parents' home regularly, where her police officer brother (Kevin Dillon) creepily wrestles with his sexy sister and slaps handcuffs on her for fun, and her mother (Ellen Burstyn) nags and scolds. Yet wouldn't you know it, her mother is actually (and predictably) proud of her daughter, contrary to her professed sour reaction to the college idea.</p>
        <p>Lydia's neighborhood also seems familiar, perhaps because we've seen it before in Martin Scorsese movies, but here minus the gangsters. The show's writers bluntly make this connection, just in case the audience doesn't get it. When Lydia stops to talk to her father (Paul Sorvino), a highway toll collector, he tells her he's listening to a tape sung by Joe Pesci (who appeared with Mr. Sorvino in Mr. Scorsese's ''Goodfellas''). The point, whatever it is, feels labored.</p>
        <p>If the show manages to settle on a consistent tone, much still rides on the slender shoulders of Ms. Kent. The first episode is staged as a long monologue, with the bartender-coed unloading her story on one of her regular customers. Ms. Kent is game but not always steady as she begins to negotiate the tough-but-tender course the show's producers and writers have set for Lydia.</p>
