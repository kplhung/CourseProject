      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The shot left his hands an instant before the final horn blared, an arching rainbow from 22 feet.</p>
        <p>''Don't foul, Antonio,'' Antonio McDyess, the United States forward, told himself when Sarunas Jasikevicius of Lithuania curled around a screen and went up for the shot of his life. McDyess jumped and flailed at the ball. ''Don't foul.''</p>
        <p>Twelve of the world's greatest players watched the 3-point attempt float toward the rim and wondered: Is this really happening?</p>
        <p>Jasikevicius' shot needed to travel 22 feet. As a piercing sellout crowd of 15,000 at the Super Dome shrieked, the ball went slightly more than 21 feet, to the left and short of the iron. About 10 inches; that's how close the United States men's basketball team came to infamy. They would have been the victim of one of the most astounding upsets in international team sports, perhaps more shocking than the Soviet hockey team in 1980 or the United States men's basketball team at the 1972 Munich Games.</p>
        <p>If the ball went in, ''it would have haunted us for the rest of our lives,'' Ray Allen said after Team USA escaped with an 85-83 semifinal victory.</p>
        <p>The United States will play for the gold medal against France on Sunday because Vince Carter made the most important shot of his career with 31 seconds remaining -- a running floater along the baseline -- to give the Americans an 82-81 lead; because Kevin Garnett employed his 7-foot reach to steal the ball in the backcourt with 25 seconds remaining; because McDyess put back Garnett's missed free throw for an 84-81 lead.</p>
        <p>Jasikevicius, the former University of Maryland guard who finished with 27 points, then scored a layup to draw Lithuania to 84-83 with 11 seconds remaining. Jason Kidd was fouled with nine seconds left. He made the first free throw but missed the second. The ball squirted off the rim and a scrum ensued. Jump ball. McDyess was whistled for a jump-ball violation, so with 5.2 seconds remaining, Lithuania had the ball at midcourt with a chance to accomplish the unthinkable.</p>
        <p>''My knuckles were white,'' McDyess said. ''I was nervous sitting on the bench before I went in. People can say what they want, but we were stunned.''</p>
        <p>When the shot fell short, Jasikevicius fell to his knees and put his hands on his head. Team USA Coach Rudy Tomjanovich pumped his fist into the air. The assistant coach Larry Brown, irate at the officiating, went after the referees as they left the court and had to be restrained by the team trainer.</p>
        <p>Few American players acknowledged the Lithuanians after the buzzer, huddling at center court instead of engaging in the traditional postgame handshakes.</p>
        <p>''I didn't get a chance to say, 'Thanks, good luck in the finals or whatever,' '' said Darius Songaila, the Lithuanian forward who will be a junior at Wake Forest.</p>
        <p>''They just got in a huddle in the middle and walked away,'' he added. ''I don't know what they were trying to say by doing that.''</p>
        <p>For two weeks, Australians have cheered most all the Olympians, but the United States men's basketball team has not been not embraced. Perhaps it was because of the numerous altercations on the court with opponents, the trash talking, the posing by Carter after each sensational dunk or the general disrespect they showed their inferior opponents. Even international journalists were standing and applauding for the Lithuanians to pull the upset.</p>
        <p>Twelve Eastern Europeans, none of whom had ever set foot in an N.B.A. training camp, refused to allow uncontested layups, siphoning the 30-second shot clock on each possession. ''We were essentially five guys, moving the basketball,'' said Donn Nelson, the Lithuanian assistant coach and son of the Dallas Mavericks' coach, Don Nelson, who has been working with the Lithuanians since 1991.</p>
        <p>''As the Russians proved the other night, you could run on these guys,'' he added. ''They're not the greatest at getting back. Make them guard. Shorten the game. Get them into a shooting contest. Then maybe you give yourself a chance.''</p>
        <p>The Lithuanians barely stayed in the game in the first half, falling behind, 48-36. But they shocked the United States with a 20-4 run early in the second half. Packing in a zone and forcing the Americans to trade jumpers from the outside, they were playing their game and succeeding.</p>
        <p>Neither team trailed by more than 4 points over the final 16 minutes, though the Lithuanians had a grand opportunity to create distance with 43 seconds left. With the game tied, the Lithuanian shooting guard Ramunas Siskauskas was fouled by McDyess on a 3-point attempt.</p>
        <p>Having made all 16 of his free throws in the tournament, Siskauskas stepped to the line and missed the first two before converting the last one. Carter followed with his dazzling baseline move over the Lithuanian frontline.</p>
        <p>Oddly, the American players felt pressure as Lithuania refused to roll over. With less than two minutes remaining, Allen walked on the court as a substitute, not realizing McDyess was being asked to go in the game after Alonzo Mourning had fouled out.</p>
        <p>''Tim Hardaway turned around and went on a tirade,'' Allen said. ''I went back out of the game. I thought somebody was telling me to go in while I was sitting on the baseline.''</p>
        <p>At least two members of the USA Basketball traveling party privately acknowledged they were thinking of changing their travel plans because they could not imagine flying with the team on the charter plane back to America.</p>
        <p>''About 12 guys would have to change their identities,'' Kidd said. ''We'd all have to move as far away as possible. New Zealand would be my pick.''</p>
        <p>Lithuania's performance was not surprising. Eight days ago, it came within 9 points of the United States before losing, 85-76, in a preliminary game, the closest any team had come to United States professionals since they were first allowed to compete at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992.</p>
        <p>In those supernova days of Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, the authentic Dream Team would be asked for autographs after demolishing players who worshiped them by an average of 43 points a game.</p>
        <p>Until Sydney, no team had come closer than 22 points of Team USA.</p>
        <p>But the swagger had been building for more than a week. Jasikevicius refused to be intimidated and jawed with Gary Payton during that preliminary game. There was clutching and grabbing on both sides.</p>
        <p>''I think they're going to lose a game,'' Jasikevicius said afterward. ''I think they're going to lose a game here. They're treating this like a vacation.''</p>
        <p>Carter was restrained after verbally challenging at least one Lithuanian player. He raised his index finger toward the rafters, the universal sign for No. 1 almost ringing hollow after what had happened.</p>
        <p>''Maybe that's not telling me about American basketball players,'' Songaila said. ''Maybe that's more like, European basketball is getting closer to Americans.''</p>
        <p>Nelson maintained his stance from last week. ''It won't happen in my lifetime,'' he said, before adding, ''If we did pull off a miracle, I would have never coached against the United States again. I'm as red-blooded American as they come.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he wanted the shot to go in, he declined to answer. Just a few feet away, Kidd wiped a bead of sweat from his brow and smiled.</p>
        <p>''If someone had come out of the stands and told them to put a few more seconds on the clock so they could have a second chance to shoot it, you guys would have said it was probably Munich all over again,'' he said.</p>
