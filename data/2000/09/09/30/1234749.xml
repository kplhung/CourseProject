        <p>BRITAIN: PRINCE CONDEMNS DIANA BOOK -- Prince William, speaking for himself and his younger brother, condemned a new book about his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, saying, ''Of course, Harry and I are both quite upset about it -- that our mother's trust has been betrayed and that even now she's still being exploited.'' The book, by her former private secretary, Patrick Jephson, portrays Diana as a scheming rebel who lied, plotted, indulged herself in alternative health therapies, binged on candy and loved crude humor. William, 18, made the comments in an interview with reporters.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: FUGITIVES CAN RETURN -- Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said fugitives from British jails will be free to return to Ulster and remain out of jail under the early-release provisions of the Belfast peace pact. Some 430 paramilitary fighters have been freed since the 1998 accord. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, had been seeking the move, and some of those affected are I.R.A. members who have been fighting extradition from the United States.</p>

        <p>IRELAND: BODY ORGANS INQUIRY -- The government has opened an inquiry after continuing revelations that Irish hospitals removed organs from the bodies of dead children without parental consent. The investigation, which is likely to begin in November, will be conducted with the cooperation of Parents for Justice, a group campaigning on behalf of more than 2,200 parents. The organs were used for transplants and to create hormone treatments.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: SEEKING ARGENTINE'S EXTRADITION -- Cabinet ministers approved a request by Judge Baltasar Garzon to seek the extradition from Mexico of a former Argentine military officer, Ricardo Miguel Cavallo, on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism. The charges stem from acts that Mr. Cavallo, who is in a Mexican jail, is accused of committing under Argentina's military junta two decades ago.</p>

        <p>BURUNDI: MANDELA MOVING OFFICE -- Nelson Mandela, saying that the people of Burundi wanted to be closer to the leaders deciding their political future, told the United Nations Security Council he would move his Burundi peacemaking office from Arusha, Tanzania, to Bujumbura, the Burundi capital. Burundians signed a peace pact on Aug. 28, but fighting continues, with at least 18 civilians killed yesterday in clashes between ethnic Hutu rebels and the army.</p>

        <p>MOROCCO: WESTERN SAHARA TALKS END -- Moroccan officials in Berlin said another round of talks on the future of the disputed territory of Western Sahara had ended without progress. The talks, directed by James A. Baker III, a former secretary of state now representing the United Nations, have been trying to narrow differences between the Moroccans and the Polisario Front, which claims the region.</p>

        <p>ZAMBIA: OPPOSITION BID FAILS -- The governing party, the Movement for Multiparty Democracy, beat back a challenge by a new political group that hoped to use a special election to position itself as a bona fide opposition force. Solidifying its standing a year ahead of presidential and full parliamentary elections, the governing party won all eight seats up for election in this week's balloting, including seven seats being contested by the new party, the Republican Party.</p>

        <p>CANADA: NEW DEFECTION TO LIBERALS -- The governing Liberal Party has won its fourth defection this month, Andre Harvey, a former Conservative from Quebec, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. With an election possible in November, the switch would bolster the Liberals to 161 seats, meaning the party would have to lose 11 seats in the next election to give up its governing majority.</p>

        <p>CANADA: GAY ACTIVIST A CANDIDATE -- Stockwell Day, leader of a conservative party that has been accused of homophobia, has recruited a gay activist to run for Parliament from a Montreal district with a large homosexual population. Stephane Prud'homme said he would run for the Canadian Alliance because the party ''truly wants to show that it accepts gays and lesbians, people who differ from the majority.'' Mr. Prud'homme will run against Gilles Duceppe, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois.</p>

        <p>INDIA: EX-PREMIER CONVICTED -- Former Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, 79, was convicted of conspiring to buy the votes of members of Parliament in 1993 before his minority government faced a no-confidence motion. Mr. Rao, who resigned from the Congress Party leadership in 1996, is the first Indian prime minister or former prime minister to be charged in a criminal case. Sentencing was set for Oct. 11.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: REBEL WARNING -- Separatist Tamil rebels told civilians in areas of the northern Jaffna Peninsula, including those in the town of Koddikamam, to leave their homes and move to safer areas. There was heavy fighting on the peninsula as the Tamil Tigers made a series of strikes against military forces. The government said 32 soldiers and 120 rebels had been killed in the past four days.</p>

        <p>IRAQ: FRENCH FLIGHT ABORTED -- A French flight carrying anti-sanctions protesters to Baghdad had to be called off when organizers of the trip could not strike a deal with a Belgian air charter company. An attempt to find a plane in Italy also had to be aborted. The organizers blamed both the French and Belgian governments for effectively blocking the flight; France said the plane's papers were not in order.</p>
