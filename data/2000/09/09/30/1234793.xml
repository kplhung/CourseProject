        <p>After months of delay, the E-ZPass toll-collection system goes into effect today on the New Jersey Turnpike, along with both a toll increase and a new three-tiered structure of fees intended to reduce rush-hour traffic.</p>
        <p>''That's a sea change,'' the highway's executive director, Edward Gross, said of the biggest one-day switch in the toll-collection procedure since the highway opened in 1952. ''Our system has been tested and retested, and it really is high quality and will work. Now motorists have to get accustomed.''</p>
        <p>To help the befuddled, and, officials hope, to prevent any major congestion along the 148-mile turnpike after the new system begins at 4 a.m., 150 workers will be added to the toll plaza staff until next weekend to answer drivers' questions and ease any frayed tempers.</p>
        <p>The completion of E-ZPass on New Jersey's two big state toll roads (installation on the Garden State Parkway was finished recently) closes a big gap in electronic toll collections intended to let motorists travel from points in western New York and eastern Massachusetts as far south as Maryland without waiting in lines or fumbling with cash at toll plazas. Instead, computers handle the transaction, first scanning an electronic toll tag affixed to the driver's windshield and then deducting the toll from an E-ZPass account.</p>
        <p>New York finished installing E-ZPass on the Thruway three years ago. All the tunnels and bridges in New York City are equipped. Massachusetts and Maryland have comparable systems. And now New Jersey joins them, years after Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and state transportation officials started trumpeting the idea. In 1996, they talked about the system starting on the turnpike and parkway by 1998.</p>
        <p>But several problems disrupted that timetable. The losing bidder for the $500 million contract to install and operate E-ZPass in New Jersey spent a year and a half in court trying unsuccessfully to overturn the contract, Mr. Gross said. Then the parent company of the winning bidder, Adesta Transportation, was beset with financial problems for a time. Another element in the delay was the need to activate the entire system on the turnpike at one time because its toll system is based on length of travel on the highway. E-ZPass came to the Garden State Parkway at staggered times in recent months because its tolls are fixed at 25 or 35 cents between toll plazas. The parkway's tolls have remained stable with E-ZPass. But the turnpike's will change today.</p>
        <p>For drivers not enrolled in E-ZPass, tolls will increase 20 percent, pushing the cost of a trip between the turnpike's northernmost plaza, 18W, and its southernmost, Interchange 1 near the Delaware River, to $5.50 from $4.60.</p>
        <p>For those with E-ZPass, tolls will go up 8 percent for trips on weekends and during weekday rush hours from 7 to 9 a.m. and from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. Motorists who enter a toll plaza between those hours face the 8 percent increase, which raises the toll between Interchanges 18W and 1 to $4.95 from $4.60.</p>
        <p>E-ZPass users who travel the turnpike on weekdays in the 20 hours not classified as rush hours will not face an increase.</p>
        <p>Truckers will face a 13 percent increase across the board. Mr. Gross said the higher rush-hour tolls were intended to increase travel during so-called off-peak hours. He said that rush-hour traffic was near capacity on the turnpike, but that traffic during nonrush hours was considerably below the highway's capacity.</p>
        <p>The rate increase, which is expected to produce $35 million a year, is not linked to the installation of E-ZPass. Turnpike officials approved it to pay for a five-year, $917 million capital improvement program for the highway. The work is to include construction of new toll plazas at Interchange 1 and on the turnpike's eastern spur between Interchanges 15E and 16E in Bergen County, Mr. Gross said.</p>
        <p>The money for building and operating E-ZPass will come from fines collected from toll-evading motorists who are not enrolled in E-ZPass but zip through its lanes, Mr. Gross said.</p>
