        <p>Moving to a new phase of the Lockerbie trial, Scottish police officers described today how they had acquired the personal diary of one of the two Libyans accused of putting a bomb aboard Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988.</p>
        <p>But their testimony had hardly begun when it created an unusual and intriguing legal tussle.</p>
        <p>One entry in the diary, which was on or in Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah's desk at a Malta travel agency when the police obtained it in April 1991, is believed to be crucial to convicting him.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors have not described it because the trial is taking place under Scottish law, and Scottish criminal courts do not allow opening statements. But it has been reported to say, ''Pick up Air Malta luggage tags'' or words to that effect, on a date shortly before Dec. 21, 1988.</p>
        <p>On Dec. 21, prosecutors contend, an unaccompanied suitcase with a bomb inside was loaded onto Air Malta flight KM180 to Frankfurt, tagged to transfer to Pan Am 103 to London and New York. The plane exploded shortly after leaving London and crashed over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground.</p>
        <p>Luggage tags are, obviously, not normally picked up before a passenger checks in for a flight, but Mr. Fhimah, as station manager for Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta, might have had access to them.</p>
        <p>But the entry was never read out today because the defense objected that the diary had been illegally obtained from Mr. Fhimah's Maltese business partner and therefore could not be used as evidence.</p>
        <p>To determine whether that is so, the court quickly shifted into a ''trial within a trial,'' the equivalent of an evidence hearing in the United States, but unusual in that the three Lockerbie judges are also acting as the Lockerbie jury.</p>
        <p>The three are essentially holding a hearing about the diary, as judges, to determine whether they, as the jury, will be allowed to hear about the diary. ''We shall therefore move into a trial-within-a-trial mode,'' ruled the presiding judge, Ranald I. Sutherland. ''We shall put ourselves out as far as a jury is concerned.''</p>
        <p>They may even hear testimony next week from Mr. Fhimah as to where the diary was or whether he gave his partner permission, after the fact, to turn it over.</p>
        <p>Defendants often do not testify at their own trials because it opens them up to damning cross-examinations. But a defense lawyer, Richard Keen, argued that Mr. Fhimah's testimony can be ''ring-fenced'' to the trial-within-a-trial without opening him up to cross-examination on the main trial's issue -- whether he conspired to blow up an airplane.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Keen succeeds in getting the diary excluded, there is little other evidence connecting Mr. Fhimah to the plot. Only his co-accused, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi, has been linked to buying bomb timers.</p>
        <p>The two Scottish detectives, Henry Woods Bell and Peter Avent, testified that they, an F.B.I. agent and a Maltese police sergeant met with Mr. Fhimah's Maltese partner, Vincent Vassallo, on April 22, 1981, at the office of Medtours, which the prosecution calls a front company for Libyan intelligence.</p>
        <p>After a five-hour interview, they both testified, Mr. Vassallo was collecting stationery samples to give them, when he looked in or on Mr. Fhimah's desk and found his 1988 diary. They paged through it, found it was in Arabic, and asked if they could keep it to have it translated.</p>
        <p>''There was slight hesitation in the sense that it was Mr. Fhimah's diary,'' Detective Bell testified, ''but as I suggested to him that as Mr. Fhimah wasn't available and he was in charge of the office and a shareholder, that he had the authority to give us the diary, and he agreed.''</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Vassallo later told him he had spoken to Mr. Fhimah in Libya, and Mr. Fhimah ''had said there's no problem, to give them anything they wanted.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Keen pressed them hard, trying to show that they already considered Mr. Fhimah a suspect and so should have had a warrant.</p>
        <p>They knew that someone at 3 St. John's Flats, Spring Street, in the Maltese town of Mosta, had received a phone call from Mr. Megrahi just before the bombing. They had already asked for the lease, and then Mr. Fhimah's police files, immigration records, work permit and utility bills. They had also, without a warrant but with the landlady's permission, searched the apartment, which by then had been vacated. They photographed it and took a briefcase and a stray lump of household putty for forensic analysis -- a decision that gave Mr. Keen a chance to vent his talent for sarcasm.</p>
        <p>''Why did you remove somebody else's putty from the flat, Mr. Bell?'' he asked again and again, as Detective Bell waffled, trying to avoid saying that he had suspected that it might be a plastic explosive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Keen also put it to them that the Maltese sergeant had said Detective Bell himself had searched Mr. Fhimah's desk during the Medtours visit and found the diary, which both police officers vigorously denied. He also suggested that they had simply told Mr. Vassallo they were taking it, which they also denied.</p>
        <p>Mr. Keen did get Detective Bell to admit that he had not filled out a receipt label for the diary and given it to Mr. Vassallo until several days later, but had written Mr. Vassallo's statement as if he had received one.</p>
        <p>That happened, the detective, said, because it was already late at night; he intended to make a label and give it to Mr. Vassallo in the next few days, he said.</p>
