        <p>Machines have always seemed to possess imposing and threatening powers.

        <p>Machines have always seemed to possess imposing and threatening powers. Their clanking, humming energy and inhuman abilities have promised utopia -- a world of leisure and convenience and plenty. But they have also threatened apocalypse: a world in which their brutish, infernal mechanisms demolish everything we cherish. The Industrial Revolution gave us these machines; then 20th-century science amplified both their promise and their menace.</p>
        <p>But humanity, during the last century, has also tried to put machines in their place. What if these mechanical monsters were shrunk to a manageable size? What if their operations were mimicked and mocked? What if they were stripped of all possible use?</p>
        <p>What if, that is, they were humiliatingly turned into toys? These once-intimidating hulks would then be seen for the awkward creations they are: stilted imitations of the human, going through geared contortions to perform their appointed tasks. Machinery, shorn of its aura, becomes the object of satire.</p>
        <p>The Swiss sculptor Jean Tinguely, for example, once spent weeks building a machine whose sole function was to destroy itself. The cartoonist Rube Goldberg sketched implausible mechanisms constructed from spoons and string and other sundry materials whose needless complexity increased with the simplicity of the task to be performed.</p>
        <p>Now something different is taking place. Old-style machines, of course, have not disappeared. There are still countless factories with grinding gears, conveyor belts and chimneys belching smoke. But technological fears and hopes are focused less on machines with moving parts than on electronic objects that don't have any moving parts at all. Open a remote control, peek at a circuit board: nothing moves or changes; their powers seem due more to magic than to mechanism. And these are the objects that inspire contemporary nightmares: the computer villains of ''The Matrix'' or the fluid, self-replicating Exterminator. Meanwhile, machinery -- real, moving, mechanical machinery -- has come to seem almost amiably old-fashioned, less like something out of Charlie Chaplin's ''Modern Times'' and more like the fussy C-3PO of ''Star Wars.'' Machines now seem closer to the human world than the technological one.</p>
        <p>Such thoughts came to mind recently at an exhilarating exhibition of mechanical constructions by Steven Gerberich at the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, Mass., on view through Oct. 22. Push oversize red buttons and his contraptions begin to move.</p>
        <p>In one, a ''bowling pin factory,'' various robots constructed out of old office furniture and junk metal work other machines that shape and paint the pins. One robot must have wandered into the wrong factory: he's cutting the pins in half and turning them into mini-mandolins. This is not a satire or a polemic about automated labor; it is not a big pronouncement. It is a life-size toy, a tribute paid to technology in play.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerberich has even provided a recipe for his technique. It requires, he says, 1 cup Duchamp,  1/2 cup Cornell, 3 teaspoons  Calder, 2 tablespoons Kienholz, 1 lb.  Rauschenberg and a sprinkle of Tinguely. He doesn't indicate how the mixture is to be prepared, but here it seems briskly stirred, with all sediment of solemnity and monumentalism drained away.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerberich works out of a studio in Brooklyn and gathers scrap metal and bottle caps and tea kettles and battered suitcases to create his machines. A man fishing, a dog going for a walk, an ensemble of musicians, three critics gabbing in front of microphones -- these are figures that come to life, their skeletal mechanisms on gleeful display. But they don't actually accomplish anything: bowling pins aren't really made (the robots gesture over their materials), fish aren't caught (the line is just continuously tossed), the dog doesn't get his bone (it hangs just beyond his reach). No goal is actually attained. The machines keep trying but never succeed. The inventiveness is teasing; the toys toy with us and we laugh.</p>
        <p>The attempt to reconsider machines and their powers is not just Mr. Gerberich's preoccupation. About an hour's drive north of Pittsfield, at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams, the machine is also confronted in  ''Unnatural Science,'' an exhibit on view through March 15. One room-size construction, ''Apparatus for the Distillation of Vague Intuitions'' by Eve Andree Laramee, contains laboratory tables filled with interlooping networks of blown glass. At first it seems to be a ''machine'' of intricate complexity. But the laboratory is actually useless: nothing is really connected; no experiment is possible. And the labels on the beakers are not precise numbers but words like ''blunder'' or ''error'' or ''dither.'' The apparatus is, in other words, a 20th-century-style attempt to strip the scientific lab-machine of its oppressive authority.</p>
        <p>This cutely implemented polemic has a dated flavor. And many of the exhibit's other pieces succumb to annoyingly facile pronouncements (Eugenics is bad! Genetic experimentation is scary!). But there is at least one charmingly peculiar object that completely occupies a 300-foot-long, two-story room. Constructed by Tim Hawkinson, it is called an ''Uberorgan'' -- literally an organ whose ''pipes'' are 13 bulbous, bus-size balloons wrapped in red netting. They are fitted with reeds and attached by umbilical tubes to a mechanical bellows that pumps air to produce bleating bursts. Motion detectors modify the pitches while a roll of player-piano paper programs the organ to play plodding, unrecognizable hymns that emerge as stomach-rumbling blurps of sound.</p>
        <p>The organ is almost offensive in its immense, growling indigestions. It is as if one had somehow entered the alimentary canal of a hippopotamus. The instrument is the size of the old machines that promised heaven and hell. Yet it is not something alien and beyond our ken. We are at home with it. The organ alters the boundary between organic and inorganic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hawkinson's construction is overdone and less whimsical than Mr. Gerberich's inventions, but, like them, it celebrates a new relationship between human and machine, one that resonates far outside northwestern Massachussetts. Leave utopia and the apocalypse to electronics and digital technology. A comic, nostalgic and admiring accommodation now seems to be developing between moving contraptions and their creators.</p>
