        <p>In the long struggle over abortion, each side has periodically changed tactics to adapt to an altered political or legal climate.</p>
        <p>When the anti-abortion movement was stymied in its efforts to outlaw abortion in the 1970's, its allies in Congress succeeded in blocking federal financing for it, a barrier that is still largely in place.</p>
        <p>When the Supreme Court appeared on the verge of overturning the Constitutional right to abortion in 1989, thus reopening the political struggle on the issue, abortion rights groups mobilized their supporters and had some important victories at the polls.</p>
        <p>And when the great blockades of abortion clinics occurred a decade ago, supporters of abortion rights won passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which substantially reduced the protests.</p>
        <p>The government's approval this week of RU-486, the French abortion pill, was a major victory by the abortion rights side and will almost certainly prompt another shift in tactics, advocates on both sides agree.</p>
        <p>But nobody was quite sure what it would be, in part because so much depends on the outcome of the November election, and whether the White House is occupied by Gov. George W. Bush, who opposes legalized abortion in most cases, or Vice President Al Gore, who supports abortion rights.</p>
        <p>''I don't think anything happened yesterday that is irreversible,'' said Gary Bauer, the conservative who leads Campaign for Working Families.</p>
        <p>Another conservative strategist said, ''It's always two steps forward, one step back, whether its pro-choice or pro-life -- you always get a victory followed by a setback.''</p>
        <p>The public message from many anti-abortion leaders today was fairly consistent and reflected the more complicated nature of the abortion debate these days: RU-486 carries risks, they argued, and doctors and women should be educated about them.</p>
        <p>It is not a simple solution to an unwanted pregnancy. And, these leaders said, it will work against the Clinton-Gore promise to make abortion ''safe, legal and rare.''</p>
        <p>The anti-abortion message seemed aimed at the enduring American ambivalence on the issue: In a New York Times/CBS News poll taken in early September, 35 percent of those polled said they wanted abortion to be generally available. But a plurality, 42 percent, said that while they wanted abortion to be available, they wanted stricter limits governing it than it has today. Twenty-one percent said abortion should not be permitted at all.</p>
        <p>A New York Times poll on abortion two years ago showed that Americans were more comfortable with early abortions, which the abortion pill would produce, but also that nearly half thought abortions were already too easy to get.</p>
        <p>Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster, said today, ''I think a good Republican message is we don't think abortion should become more available or more easily available.''</p>
        <p>The remarks, in fact, were carefully calibrated from the anti-abortion side. Asked about RU-486 by reporters at the Christian Coalition convention here today, the Rev. Pat Robertson replied, ''I think that release of the RU-486 from the F.D.A. looks to me like an election ploy that is right up with 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''I think frankly this is a trap. I'm hoping that Mr. Bush will avoid the trap. I think his statement was good, I think what's needed is medical evidence to make sure we don't damage American women.''</p>
        <p>Some in the anti-abortion movement disagreed that Mr. Bush's careful statement -- saying he thought the F.D.A.'s decision was wrong but stopping short of promising its reversal -- was the right approach.</p>
        <p>But after eight long years without an ally in the White House, social conservatives have given Mr. Bush considerable running room this year in his bid for the center, which includes many women who support legalized abortion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robertson was urging his audience today to stay focused on the Supreme Court, and the power that the next president will have to reshape it. That reflects part of what many analysts see as the new political pragmatism of conservatives.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, anti-abortion forces said they were focusing on ''education.'' Judie Brown of the American Life League, an anti-abortion group, said that ''grass-roots people have to be encouraged to identify who these physicians are who are going to distribute this drug, and then try to educate them about the problems.'' Ms. Brown dismissed the notion that this would translate into the harassment of doctors.</p>
        <p>Olivia Gans of the National Right to Life Committee said her organization was trying to spread the word to ''the medical community and women at large'' not to ''buy the rhetoric'' of the abortion rights side about the abortion pill.</p>
        <p>Depending on the political lay of the land next year, the anti-abortion movement can push for Congressional hearings, more restrictions and reviews of the drug.</p>
        <p>Some analysts note that since the Supreme Court upheld the Constitutional right to abortion in 1992, the struggle has been a kind of trench warfare, state by state and session by session in Congress over restrictions on the practice.</p>
        <p>''I think there are a lot of people who would like a magic solution to the abortion debate in this country,'' said Vicki Saporta, executive director of the National Abortion Federation, which represents clinics and other abortion providers. ''While an incredibly important breakthrough for women,'' Ms. Saporta said, RU-486 is not that magic fix.</p>
        <p>If history is any guide, the anti-abortion movement will adapt.</p>
