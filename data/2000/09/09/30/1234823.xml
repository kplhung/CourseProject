        <p>When Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, chose Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his running mate, the decision made history, as Mr. Lieberman became the first Jew on a major party presidential ticket.</p>
        <p>So, earlier this week, before the Jewish High Holy Days (Rosh Hashana began at sundown yesterday), it seemed appropriate to ask a few people prominent in Jewish religious circles what they would like to hear said from the pulpit about Mr. Lieberman's new status.</p>
        <p>As Rabbi Norman Lamm, president of Yeshiva University in New York, said, it might be ''almost impossible not to'' mention Mr. Lieberman in coming sermons.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Lieberman, Dr. Lamm is an Orthodox Jew, and also shares with him the distinction of belonging to Orthodoxy's Modern, or Centrist, wing. So it is not surprising that he regards the selection of Mr. Lieberman, who is open about being religiously observant, as the shattering of a glass ceiling in politics. ''It gives a great infusion of spirit and optimism to those of us'' who hold that it is possible to live an observant life in the secular world, Dr. Lamm said.</p>
        <p>He offered two other thoughts about what he would like to hear. First, Dr. Lamm said, ''we should not get carried away; there are things even more consequential than politics.'' But, he added, Mr. Lieberman's selection offered a measure of inspiration that would seem universal. ''We should never give up on goals that are seemingly unattainable or elusive,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yeshiva is only a few miles north of the Jewish Theological Seminary, which is affiliated with Judaism's Conservative movement. The seminary's chancellor, Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, said any sermon mentioning Mr. Lieberman should note ''that what is significant about his nomination is that he's a practicing Jew.''</p>
        <p>''His commitment to Judaism is upfront, and I think that's a reflection of the degree to which Judaism has become mainstream in American society,'' Dr. Schorsch said. And as a religious man in politics, Mr. Lieberman has, at least of late, ''struck the right balance'' between the personal and the political, he said.</p>
        <p>What then did Dr. Schorsch think about the recent speech in which Mr. Lieberman advocated a greater place for religious convictions in public life, for which he was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith?</p>
        <p>''Personally, I think there's too much religious rhetoric in the public square,'' Dr. Schorsch replied. ''This kind of rhetoric seems to be a badge we must wear. It borders at times on 'atheists and agnostics not welcome.' ''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Paul J. Menitoff would like to hear concerns about the possible negative effects of Mr. Lieberman's controversial speech included in a sermon that mentioned the vice-presidential nominee. ''I share the concern of some that that kind of rhetoric will encourage some who would tear down the barriers of church and state,'' said Rabbi Menitoff, executive vice president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, which represents rabbis in Judaism's Reform movement. ''The barriers between church and state ought to be guarded, because they are our best friend.''</p>
        <p>And yet, Rabbi Menitoff said, anyone who speaks from the pulpit about Mr. Lieberman also needs to convey ''the pride in how far we've come as American Jews.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Menitoff also offered another suggestion: a sermon mentioning Mr. Lieberman might also assert that rabbis themselves have played a role in making his political ascent possible. Rabbi Menitoff said that would be because, in many communities, rabbis have long supported civil rights and promoted understanding between religious and ethnic groups, stands he said have helped opened the door for a greater role by Jews in public life.</p>
        <p>Even when these suggestions are taken into account, it is possible that one of the more resonant statements about Mr. Lieberman's nomination has already been made -- and by a non-Jew. It happened after the news broke that Mr. Lieberman was to be Mr. Gore's running mate.</p>
        <p>The moment was recalled by Dr. Schorsch, who said, ''I must confess that I thought Jesse Jackson's comment was wonderful: 'When a barrier falls for one, it falls for all.' ''</p>
