        <p>The kid from Adelaide finally caved in three weeks ago. Between the interview requests, the slippage in her game and the mounting expectations of a nation, Lauren Jackson no longer felt like the star of the Australian national basketball team.</p>
        <p>Three weeks ago, she was just another overwhelmed 19-year-old.</p>
        <p>''I probably shouldn't think about the pressure, but before the Olympics I just collapsed in a crying heap,'' Jackson said. ''It was everything I guess, the Olympics and everything else. I was worried.''</p>
        <p>She spoke moments after leading Australia to its first appearance in a gold medal game, where Jackson and the Australians would finally get their Olympic wish: a date with Lisa Leslie and Team USA.</p>
        <p>Before nearly 15,000 of their chanting fans at the Super Dome in Olympic Park, Australia beat Brazil, 64-52. Jackson's 16 points and 9 rebounds led the way. The United States struggled early against South Korea before rallying for a 78-65 victory.</p>
        <p>Sheryl Swoopes scored 19 points before leaving the game with about four minutes left while holding her left knee. She was expected to play against Australia. Leslie added 15 points and 12 rebounds, and Natalie Williams contributed 11 rebounds and 10 points.</p>
        <p>The gold medal matchup on Saturday between the Americans and the Australians has been anticipated for two and a half weeks after a spirited exhibition between the teams in Melbourne.</p>
        <p>The Australians opened an 18-6 lead in the opening minutes of that game and trailed by only 38-37 at halftime. They were run off the floor in the final minutes, losing, 83-62. The game featured a minor altercation between Jackson and Leslie, who chest-bumped Jackson after Jackson had scuffled with Swoopes under the basket.</p>
        <p>''I realized what she was doing,'' Jackson said. ''I came back to her and said: 'What do you want? Do you want a piece of me?' She ran off. I won't stand for that.''</p>
        <p>The American women are seeking their second straight gold medal. They will have to battle not only Jackson, Michele Timms and their teammates but also a loud, partisan crowd that would die happy if Goliath went down.</p>
        <p>''For some reason, we're the team you love to hate,'' Leslie said. ''We have a saying back home: Don't player hate. Celebrate. We play hard, is all. If they want to play clean, we'll play clean. If they want to fight, we will fight. We can go any way.''</p>
        <p>She smiled. ''Why we're the bad guys, I don't know. Can't we all just get along?''</p>
        <p>The game will also mark the end of Teresa Edwards's 16-year international career. Edwards, the five-time Olympian and starting United States point guard, will finish her career against Australia.</p>
        <p>''This is it, the end of my blessed career,'' she said. ''My family is ready for me to come home. Am I thinking about it? I don't have time to worry about Teresa Edwards's last game. I have to worry about the gold medal.''</p>
        <p>Australia won its first women's basketball medal in Atlanta four years ago, taking home the bronze. With the development of Jackson and the maturing of Timms, Kristi Harrower and Michelle Griffiths -- players with Women's National Basketball Association experience -- the Opals have become one of the world's strongest teams.</p>
        <p>They move the ball around the perimeter, wait for Jackson to come open on the blocks and get back to play transition defense. Australia swept through the preliminary games and is 7-0 over the past two weeks.</p>
        <p>Jackson entrenched herself as one of the game's pre-eminent players, backing her way in for layups, spotting up for 3-pointers and rejecting shots back to the floor.</p>
        <p>''We engulfed her with confidence,'' Timms said. ''She was just young and going through a lot. She's back now, though.''</p>
        <p>Jackson said: ''I was crying after every game. I wasn't playing well. I was getting really scared. After playing America in Melbourne, it lifted a little bit, and after that I was confident, back to my old attitude.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''I really think we can beat the Americans. We showed we could play with them. Now we just have to take the next step.''</p>
