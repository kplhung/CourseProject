        <p>This town about 40 miles north of Chicago is prime territory for Democrats. Economically downtrodden and racially diverse, it has problems including pollution in Lake Michigan and crime in the streets.</p>
        <p>But Waukegan happens to be part of one of this year's closest Congressional elections, so on a crisp day recently the Republican candidate, Mark Steven Kirk, opened a satellite campaign office here and talked about environmental cleanup and poverty in ways that sometimes made him sound like a candidate from the other side.</p>
        <p>''Waukegan is not a dumping ground,'' Mr. Kirk told a small crowd. ''It is our home, and we are going to make it better. We are going to go into the public housing projects and talk about community renewal.''</p>
        <p>In a district with some of the state's wealthiest suburbs as well as several poor communities, Mr. Kirk is in a dead heat with the Democrat  candidate, Lauren Beth Gash. They are seeking the seat that has belonged, for the last 21 years, to John Edward Porter, a moderate Republican who always won re-election easily but decided not to run this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kirk, who is on leave as counsel to the House International Relations Committee and was Representative Porter's chief of staff from 1987 to 1990, has never held elective office. He is running on the idea that he knows Washington and will uphold Mr. Porter's legacy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gash, a four-term state representative known as a moderate, independent Democrat, is emphasizing her legislative experience and the fact that she has lived for years in the district, in Highland Park, not in Washington.</p>
        <p>For a race that both parties consider one of the most critical in the country, there have been remarkably few fireworks. Even some longtime political experts say they see only a few significant differences between the candidates.</p>
        <p>''I don't think you're going to get, quite frankly, dramatically different policy outcomes no matter who is elected, Republican or Democrat,'' said Alan R. Gitelson, a political science professor at Loyola University in Chicago. ''That district is not going to allow for somebody who's going to be either extreme to the left or the right. Right now no one's taking bets about who's going to win.''</p>
        <p>But if no one is putting money on the race, plenty of people are putting money in it, with Ms. Gash having raised about $1.3 million and Mr. Kirk close to $1 million.</p>
        <p>Both Marit Babin, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, and John Del Cecato, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said they would contest the seat vigorously.</p>
        <p>For two decades, the 10th District, which includes towns like Wilmette, with the highest level of postgraduate education in the country, has been comfortable with Representative Porter, a fiscal conservative and social moderate. But in recent years, it has become more hospitable to centrist Democrats like Bill Clinton -- and Ms. Gash.</p>
        <p>''When Porter was first elected, the district wasn't growing the way it is now,'' said John Pelissero, another Loyola University political science professor. ''You have younger, more active families in which women are part of the work force, have significant views about politics and are going to be a significant part of the election.''</p>
        <p>Professor Pelissero thinks that could give Ms. Gash an edge, along with her record on issues like suburban sprawl and health insurance, and her occasional breaks with her party to support Republican bills.</p>
        <p>''My voting record is very moderate,'' Ms. Gash said. ''On a regular basis people tell me they're Republicans and I'm the only Democrat they vote for.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gash, 39, suggested that being a mother of two teenagers and Jewish in a district with a large Jewish population helped her identify with many voters here. Mr. Kirk, 40, who is engaged to be married, said his advantages included being a lieutenant commander in the United States Naval Reserves and his background in foreign affairs. He now lives in the district, in Wilmette.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gash, whose campaign manager left last month amid concerns that she was not getting enough exposure, has a new manager who has helped Democrats win open seats, and a new press secretary on loan from Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, the chairwoman of the House women's caucus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kirk, who won a hotly contested 10-way primary, is distancing himself from Gov. George W. Bush, his party's nominee for president, whom polls show losing ground in Illinois.</p>
        <p>While both candidates favor abortion rights and gun control, they differ somewhat. Mr. Kirk opposes late-term abortions and public financing for them, while Ms. Gash supports abortion rights in all cases. Ms. Gash opposes a flat income tax, while Mr. Kirk said he would support one if taxpayers could deduct mortgage payments and charitable interest.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gash supports using the federal surplus for Social Security. Mr. Kirk proposes that Social Security be held in individual accounts. He says the funds would not be privatized and people would not be allowed to invest the money, but the government would have to ask their permission to borrow it.</p>
        <p>''I do not believe the government should be able to borrow against Social Security,'' Mr. Kirk said. ''The average African-American man is a net contributor to Social Security but passes away before he sees any of it. I want him to have an estate to pass on to his family.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gash called that proposal odd.  ''His response to the mortality rate of African-American men is not to fix the health care system, but to establish a risky scheme for Social Security,'' she said.</p>
        <p>That is about as close as the race has come to a bare-knuckled brawl.</p>
