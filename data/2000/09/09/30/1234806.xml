        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman came here today to deliver a blistering assault on Gov. George W. Bush's environmental record, depicting him as hellbent on ravaging the Alaskan wilderness, and Texas as choking in smog.</p>
        <p>John Cobarruvias came away pleased at how positive it had all been.</p>
        <p>''He talks about the record and sticks to the facts,'' Mr. Cobarruvias, 44, a computer engineer at NASA, said of Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic candidate for vice president. ''I'm a rocket scientist, but it doesn't take one to see that it's the other side that's going negative, not this guy.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Cobarruvias and 150 others, standing in a forlorn little park in the shadow of an oil refinery, had just heard Mr. Lieberman attack Mr. Bush and belittle Texas for a full 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>''Houston, where we are today, is now the smog capital of America,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''Texas is our most air-toxic-polluted state. Texas is No. 3 in water pollution and, sadly, No. 1 in air pollution.''</p>
        <p>He derided Mr. Bush's program that emphasizes self-policing by industrial polluters, and said the governor's proposal to drill for oil in an Alaskan wilderness ''would cause irreversible damage to one of God's most awesome creations.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lieberman has a rare talent for making attacks that do not come across as attacks. His criticisms, often prefaced by phrases like ''I'm sorry to say,'' or ''sadly,'' and delivered with a litany of supporting detail, sound less like those of an aggressive politician than of a concerned neighbor leaning over a back fence, sharing a troubling bit of gossip.</p>
        <p>''He can deliver these pretty hard-hitting messages without any sense of rancor,'' said Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University, ''and have the listener walk away feeling like he was throwing garlands of flowers. It's a tremendous asset at a time when people are clearly tired of strident attacks.''</p>
        <p>Critiques of Mr. Bush's policies are a regular part of Mr. Lieberman's pitch, in keeping with the traditional role of the No. 2 man on the ticket, going on the offensive while the presidential candidate tries to float above the fray. He routinely says that Mr. Bush would wreck the economy, return the government to deficits and endanger Medicare; that his record on children's health care in Texas has been disastrous; and that the Republican nominee's promises are hollow because he cannot pay for them.</p>
        <p>In the last week, the senator has stepped up his attacks, twice accusing the Republican ticket of trying to deceive voters, and attacking the Congressional voting by the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Dick  Cheney, against programs like Head Start and subsidized school lunches.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman often delivers barbs that his running mate, Vice President Al Gore, avoids, as when he suggested that Mr. Bush was evading debates and coddling the oil industry.</p>
        <p>''Governor Bush and Dick Cheney, as you know, have spent most of their professional lives in the oil business,'' Mr. Lieberman said today. ''In fact, within the last 48 hours, I gather that Dick Cheney attended a fund-raiser mostly among oil executives that raised $8 million. That's an awful lot of $2-a-gallon gasoline.''</p>
        <p>In surveys, voters often say they do not like negative campaigning, but of course, whether it is perceived as negative or just a recitation of the facts can depend on the listener and the way the gibes are phrased.</p>
        <p>Where Mr. Cheney, who has taken the lead in attacking Mr. Gore, comes across as reserved on the stump, even dour, the main impression Mr. Lieberman leaves is that he is enjoying himself. Even on the offensive, his relaxed tone never varies, his voice never rises, no hint of distaste crosses his face.</p>
        <p>And even Mr. Lieberman's recent, more charged remarks have lacked the sharp, sometimes personal, edges wielded by some other vice-presidential nominees, in a long, bloody, bipartisan tradition. Last week, for example, Mr. Cheney charged that Mr. Gore ''simply makes some things up out of whole cloth.''</p>
        <p>In 1988, Senator Dan Quayle said of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, ''He's taken off his Halloween mask'' and ''exposed'' himself as a liberal, while Senator Lloyd Bentsen called Vice President George Bush's campaign ''a carnival sideshow of nonsense and negativism.'' Eight years earlier, Vice President Walter F. Mondale said, ''At least when Ronald Reagan rode off in the movies into the fiery sunset, he didn't take us with him'' -- a not-so-subtle play on fears that Mr. Reagan would drag the country into war, while George Bush accused President Jimmy Carter of ''inciting hatred and division among Americans'' by running a ''low road, hatchet road'' campaign.</p>
        <p>The low point for vice-presidential vitriol in modern campaigns may have been reached by Spiro Agnew in 1968, when he accused Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey of being ''squishy-soft on Communism,'' a comment that even Mr. Agnew's fellow Republicans denounced as echoing McCarthyism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, who has made a point throughout his career of working with Republicans, has a reputation as a gentlemanly, relatively nonpartisan politician, though he won his Senate seat in Connecticut in 1988 with relentless attacks on the record of the Republican incumbent, Lowell P. Weicker Jr.</p>
        <p>This campaign does not appear to have dented Mr. Lieberman's positive image, much to the frustration of the Bush campaign, which has accused him of hypocrisy in assuming the mantle of bipartisanship while going on the attack.</p>
        <p>His aides say Mr. Lieberman can pull it off because he sticks to substance, and his criticisms are well grounded. The candidate himself suggests as much, saying repeatedly, as he did last week at a rally in Fresno, Calif., ''Al Gore and I are not going to say a negative personal word about our opponents, but we are going to talk about their policies and where they're wrong.''</p>
        <p>At stop after stop on the campaign, people who encounter Mr. Lieberman say they do not believe he engages in negative campaigning, even when he has just done so in front of them.</p>
        <p>''He's so upbeat,'' Audrey Kaufman, a retired teacher who said she is not wedded to either party, said after hearing Mr. Lieberman on Tuesday at a center for the elderly in Union, N.J. ''I haven't heard anything negative from him.''</p>
        <p>Actually, she just had. Mr. Lieberman had sought at some length to tear apart, piece by piece, the Bush and Cheney plans for Medicare.</p>
        <p>''Their plan is not a real plan, it's a real problem for real people and particularly for real seniors,'' Mr. Lieberman had said, mocking Mr. Bush's campaign slogan ''Real plans for real people.''</p>
        <p>''America deserves, Al Gore and I believe, better than a plan that takes the care out of Medicare, and the trust out of the Medicare trust fund,'' Mr. Lieberman said.</p>
        <p>When asked about such darts, Ms. Kaufman said: ''Those are just the facts. He doesn't exaggerate or say anything personal.''</p>
        <p>As disputes have arisen in this contest, the harshest words out of the Democratic camp have often come from Mr. Lieberman -- a pattern repeated in today's responses to Mr. Bush's energy plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has said little publicly about Republican criticism over the last week that the Democrats should not raise money from the entertainment industry while attacking it. But last week, Mr. Lieberman said the attacks smacked of desperation by a losing campaign, noting that while he and Mr. Gore had a plan to address violence and vulgarity in popular culture, the Republicans did not.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking forward to the day when I see George Bush and Dick Cheney stand up to their friends in the oil industry,'' he added, ''or stand up to the tobacco industry or the N.R.A.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, when Mr. Bush balked at the proposed presidential debates, Mr. Lieberman implied that Mr. Bush was afraid of facing Mr. Gore on national television, and he likened the governor's stance to a football team trying to change the location and rules of the Super Bowl just before the game. Mr. Bush eventually agreed to the debates, though with some changes in format.</p>
        <p>In the last week, Mr. Lieberman has taken to poking fun at the many slogans Mr. Bush has used. ''He says that we should leave no child behind,'' Mr. Lieberman said in Albuquerque. ''But I am sad to say that in Texas, the fact is that he has left more than one million children who need health insurance behind. That's Governor Bush's real record, what that real record has meant to real people, real children, in the state of Texas.''</p>
        <p>Professor Baker spent time in  close quarters with Mr. Lieberman early this year, when he joined a bipartisan Congressional delegation that traveled to Russia and Germany.</p>
        <p>''He has almost a pastoral quality to him,'' even when expressing an opinion strongly, Professor Baker said. ''If he were Roman Catholic, he'd be a great parish priest.''</p>
