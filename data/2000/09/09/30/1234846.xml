        <p>White House and Congressional negotiators agreed on a plan to set aside $12 billion over six years for a sweeping federal land conservation effort.</p>
        <p>White House officials and lawmakers who cobbled together the agreement after two years of debate said the money would be fenced off in a special conservation account, similar to the Highway Trust Fund, intended to assure a steady flow of money for protecting sensitive lands.</p>
        <p>The money would be used for activities like buying land for national parks and monuments, giving grants to cities for parks and green space, buying and maintaining historic sites like Civil War battlefields, and establishing wildlife refuges.</p>
        <p>''This is, by far, the greatest increase in conservation spending in the history of the country,'' said Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington, who helped negotiate the agreement.</p>
