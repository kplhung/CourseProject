        <p>On Sunday, Brazilians from the heart of this city to the depths of the Amazon will step up to a beige, toaster-sized terminal and punch a number on a keypad that corresponds to the candidate of their choice. The face of the potential mayor or city council member will pop up on the screen, and with a simple tap of a key, the candidate will be one vote closer to victory.</p>
        <p>The municipal elections will be the first voting in Brazil that is completely automated. For a country almost as large as the United States, with 323,000 polling places in areas that often do not have access to electricity, pulling off such a feat seems daunting. But for Procomp Industria Eletronica, the local electronics company that snared the $106 million contract to supply the voting machines, meeting challenges like these is business as usual.</p>
        <p>''The product was developed in a little less than six months from start to finish, thanks to Procomp's flexibility and capacity to work with partners,'' said Carlos Henrique Assuite, coordinator of the team that worked with Procomp on the project at the Fundacao Certi, a nonprofit foundation. ''That is not very common in Brazil.''</p>
        <p>The original mission of Procomp, which was founded 15 years ago, when the Brazilian market was virtually closed to the outside world, was to create bank teller networks.</p>
        <p>''At the time, there were a few companies that wanted to do many things in order to take advantage of the protected market,'' said Eric Jan Roorda, chief executive and one of the four founders of the company. ''We thought exactly the opposite. We wanted to work in the very specific niche of bank automation. As a result, we were able to manufacture a product that was much cheaper and generated larger margins.''</p>
        <p>Procomp was so committed to working its niche that Mr. Roorda was initially worried about getting too big too quickly.</p>
        <p>''When I entered the company, three years after it was founded, Eric came to me quite seriously and said that the company could never have more than 100 employees,'' said Joao Abud Jr., director of marketing and sales for Procomp.</p>
        <p>Now there are about 3,000. The company, the largest provider of teller systems and automated-teller machines in Brazil, had revenue of $341 million last year. Growth has averaged about 30 percent a year since the company was founded.</p>
        <p>''The market has behaved differently than we expected,'' Mr. Roorda said. ''The banks came to us and said: 'I have the terminals, now I need a cash dispenser. Now I need a machine to pay bills. Now I need a machine with a coin dispenser.' You have to make all of the machines in the package, or you are out.''</p>
        <p>Procomp's success has come largely from its ability to find unusual solutions for Brazil's particular automation needs. With the voting machines, for example, the company needed to offer visual cues to accommodate a population with a low literacy rate.</p>
        <p>With the A.T.M.'s, it had to be responsive to the quirks of how Brazilians handle their money.</p>
        <p>Take salaries. Because only about half of the 80 million working Brazilians have bank accounts, employers often pay workers through a magnetic card that can be swiped through a special bank machine that will dispense the entire value of the paycheck in cash. But the machines carry only big bills, and clients using the machine often then wait in line at the teller for the change. So Procomp designed a machine that dispenses small bills and coins.</p>
        <p>Procomp has since expanded its repertory of solutions to such products as the voting machines, known as electronic urns, and bank security systems. And it recently won a contract to automate the federal government's health care system.</p>
        <p>The company has also started thinking globally. Mr. Roorda says that Procomp has an edge in meeting the needs of other developing countries. ''Our systems would adapt more easily,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And they are not the only ones who think so.</p>
        <p>After years of serving as its distributor, Procomp was bought last October for $225 million by Diebold Inc. of North Canton, Ohio, the largest A.T.M. provider in the United States, as part of both companies' international expansion strategy.</p>
