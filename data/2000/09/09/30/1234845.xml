        <p>The violent clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians in the center of Jerusalem's Old City yesterday were disheartening. Just when Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, need to make another attempt to conclude a peace agreement, renewed tensions prevail. Ariel Sharon, the Likud leader, did Israel no favor by provocatively leading his supporters to the Temple Mount on Thursday, asserting Jewish claims to the Muslim holy site at a moment when authority over the area is the most sensitive remaining issue in the peace talks. The Sharon visit led to a series of confrontations that culminated in bloodshed hours before the beginning of the Jewish High Holy Days.</p>
        <p>The Israeli political calendar leaves little time for further delay in negotiations with the Palestinians. Four weeks from tomorrow Israel's Parliament will return from its recess, bringing renewed pressure on Mr. Barak's minority government for new elections or a more right-leaning coalition cabinet. Israeli, Palestinian and American negotiators must try to use the weeks ahead to resolve the relatively few but highly charged issues blocking a final peace agreement.</p>
        <p>The Camp David meeting in July pointed toward progress on a number of previously intractable issues. But it broke down over questions of political authority in Jerusalem, particularly sovereignty over the Old City's principal religious sites. The Temple Mount contains two of Islam's holiest mosques, the Dome of the Rock and al-Aksa. Along one side of the Mount is the Western Wall, a remnant of the ancient Second Temple and Judaism's most sacred place of worship. Finding a creative formula for international sovereignty over the Temple Mount is the key to a final settlement.</p>
        <p>At Camp David, for the first time, Mr. Barak signaled that Israel would consider giving up some of the sovereignty it now exercises over all Jerusalem for the sake of a comprehensive peace. He is willing to let some of the city's Arab residential areas be transferred to Palestinian control. For the Old City and its religious sites, Israel rejects Palestinian sovereignty but is prepared to consider more flexible formulas. One idea currently being considered is to let the United Nations Security Council exercise sovereignty over the Temple Mount. None of Israel's proposed compromises have drawn a positive response from Mr. Arafat, who declares that the entire Arab and Islamic world supports his demand for full Palestinian sovereignty over the Temple Mount.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Arafat maintains this unhelpful rigidity there will be no agreement. If Israeli politics then shifts in a more hawkish direction, the Palestinians will have lost a historic chance for an internationally recognized state with substantial American and international financial assistance.</p>
        <p>Although most of the burden for compromise now lies with Mr. Arafat, Mr. Barak can help. The personal relationship between the two leaders has been chilly. Mr. Barak is making efforts to establish a better rapport, including a cordial meeting the two men held in Israel this week. American diplomacy can also help.</p>
        <p>But in the end, if negotiations are not undermined by a new round of unrest, Mr. Arafat must decide if he is ready to make a deal with an Israeli government willing to offer the most generous compromise terms possible under current political circumstances. If he passes up this opportunity, the result could be many more years of stalemate and conflict.</p>
