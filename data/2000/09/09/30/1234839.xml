        <p>A federal magistrate judge has reversed himself and ruled that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani does not have to submit to questioning under oath in a lawsuit over the emergency demolition of a Lower East Side apartment building in 1998.</p>
        <p>But the magistrate, James C. Francis IV of Federal District Court in Manhattan, criticized the city for what he called the ''cavalier manner'' in which the city had treated the initial request for a deposition of the mayor, and for failing ''to provide a persuasive'' reason to block it.</p>
        <p>The city had initially objected to the deposition by filing only a one-paragraph letter, Magistrate Francis wrote in the ruling, issued Thursday. He said it was only after he gave the city a second chance -- what he called a ''do-over'' -- that he was convinced that Mr. Giuliani lacked knowledge about the demolition.</p>
        <p>In six years as mayor, Mr. Giuliani has never been deposed in a lawsuit, city officials said.</p>
        <p>This suit was filed by owners and tenants who had lived in a five-story building at 172 Stanton Street, which was demolished on Jan. 24, 1998, after the rear wall collapsed. No one was injured, but Mr. Giuliani went to the scene and gave an impromptu news conference, saying the building was unsafe and had to be taken down.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs claimed that the demolition was illegal because the city failed to follow the proper procedures or give notice to the tenants and owners, and that the demolition cost them thousands of dollars.</p>
        <p>Daniel C. Marotta, one of the plaintiff's lawyers, said the decision against requiring the mayor's deposition will be appealed. ''We are confident that the decision will be reversed,'' he said. Lorna B. Goodman, a senior lawyer in the corporation counsel's office, said the city was pleased with the ruling, but called the magistrate's criticism of the city ''gratuitous.''</p>
        <p>''It adds nothing to the decision,'' Ms. Goodman said, ''and it was unnecessary.''</p>
        <p>Magistrate Francis had initially ordered that Mr. Giuliani submit to a deposition last February after the plaintiff's lawyers said that they had interviewed 16 witnesses but could  not identify who had made the demolition decision.</p>
        <p>The city appealed to Judge Richard M. Berman, who was presiding in the case and had asked Magistrate  Francis to handle pretrial discovery.</p>
        <p>It was then that the city filed a statement by Mr. Giuliani in which he denied knowledge of how the decision was made.</p>
        <p>''I do not know the details of how the decision to vacate the building or the decision to demolish the building were made,'' the mayor said. He also said he did not recall who had told him the building was unsafe.</p>
        <p>Judge Berman then asked Magistrate Francis to reconsider the matter. Magistrate Francis said in his ruling that it was a ''close question'' but that he was now convinced that Mr. Giuliani ''lacks knowledge'' of the details of the decision.</p>
