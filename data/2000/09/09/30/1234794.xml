        <p>Denmark's rejection of a single European currency has brought home two sobering messages here to a government that probably figured that it had enough to worry about as it was.</p>
        <p>First, the resounding outcome of a Danish referendum on Thursday threatens to jeopardize, or at least delay, Prime Minister Tony Blair's proposal for a similar plebiscite, a cornerstone of his plan to persuade reluctant Britons to abandon their cherished pound in favor of the euro.</p>
        <p>Second, the passions highlighted by the Danish vote undermine Mr. Blair's efforts to cast Britain's debate in primarily economic terms. In the end, and for all the huge differences between Britain and Denmark, what counted was the politics. Danes, skeptics here say, simply saw the euro as the stalking horse of a European superstate that would submerge their sovereignty. The government's fear is that Britons, given half the chance, would do the same.</p>
        <p>''The Danes saw what Tony Blair denies, that the euro is a political project whose final goal is a European state,'' Lord Lamont, a euro opponent, said. ''I have no doubt that the British people will show the same courage as the Danes.''</p>
        <p>Trevor Greetham, a stock market strategist with Merrill Lynch here, said the Danish outcome, 53.1 percent against the euro to 46.9, ''makes it much less likely'' that Britain and Sweden, another holdout, will even join the single currency.</p>
        <p>Since the euro was conjured into existence 20 months ago, Britain has been the principal heretic to challenge a Franco-German orthodoxy, insisting that Europe's future lay in ever closer monetary and political union. When 11 nations formed the currency, Britain remained aloof, along with Denmark, Sweden and Greece, which has now qualified to join the currency. Since then, with the euro's plummeting against the pound and the dollar, the number of Britons opposed to the euro has, at least in public opinion, risen to 75 percent.</p>
        <p>Throughout that period, though, the supporters, including Mr. Blair and some cabinet ministers, notably Foreign Minister Robin Cook, have seemed to imply that euro membership was somehow inevitable if Britain was to avoid a perilous isolation from European decision making.</p>
        <p>The vote among the Danes, thus, came to be seen as an oracle of Britain's destiny, a perception that spilled over into front-page headlines from the overwhelmingly skeptical press. ''There ain't nothin' like a Dane,'' The Sun proclaimed.</p>
        <p>Others drew broader conclusions.</p>
        <p>''We are not now isolated,'' said Michael Portillo, a leading financial spokesman for the opposition Conservatives, who want no talk of a referendum for at least five or six years. ''Other people in Europe have taken the same view.''</p>
        <p>As government officials and others point out, many differences, political and economic, separate Britain and Denmark. In Denmark, the press, business and political powers all favored a yes vote. In Britain, business leaders and politicians are deeply divided, and the mass readership newspapers oppose the euro.</p>
        <p>Denmark's small economy, moreover, has been a de facto extension of the euro zone, and its predecessor, the Deutsche mark zone, for years. By contrast, most British economic indicators, from interest rates to unemployment, show a marked divergence from continental Europe, and there are much broader economic implications for Britain's economy than there were in Denmark's case.</p>
        <p>Britain's ability to persuade foreign companies to invest here as a springboard for continental Europe, the government argues, is closely linked to its prospects of joining the euro. And well over half of Britain's trade is with the European Union.</p>
        <p>''Those are critical, crucial questions that will weigh with the British people, who will make the decision what is right for Britain, not what is right for Denmark,'' Mr. Cook said.</p>
        <p>But the lesson from Copenhagen was that those will not be the most telling arguments, said people like Mark Miller, an economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''Britain might do well to learn from the Danish experience and leave economics, or at least detailed economics, out of the debate,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>
        <p>Rather, some people say, the issue will be decided on questions of sovereignty and national interest. The Danish vote, Mr. Greetham said, ''was a pure test of the political will to become part of the Franco-German vision of a large superstate.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Blair, Denmark's rejection adds one more woe after bruising protests against high fuel prices and other setbacks that have stripped his aura of invincibility.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair insists that Britain's membership of the euro will be determined in a two-phase approach. First, the government will decide whether the euro's performance meets various economic criteria beneficial to Britain. If it does, a referendum will be held four months later to put the same question to Britons that the Danes answered on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The government has long insisted that the entire process will not begin until after a general election that is widely forecast for May, resisting Conservative efforts to make the euro the central issue of a populist campaign that plays on hostility to the euro.</p>
        <p>The Danish vote has, however, confronted the government with a new problem. If the government seeks to swing opinion toward the euro with a high-profile campaign, it could allow the Conservatives to turn the election into a perilous referendum on the euro. Yet, if Mr. Blair remains low key on the euro, hostility, particularly after the Danish vote, could deepen. ''Britain should be in,'' a Financial Times editorial said today. ''But the Danish 'no' vote suggests that without a vigorous and imaginative campaign, the euroskeptics may win by default. Mr. Blair cannot afford to dally.''</p>
        <p>An upshot of those factors is that Britain's referendum is quite likely to be further delayed, as the government awaits as the moment to pronounce whether the single currency has met its criteria for British membership. In practical terms, Britain might take only the first definitive step toward joining the euro in 2004, at the earliest, Mr. Miller said. ''And the likely time horizon is even further out than that.''</p>
