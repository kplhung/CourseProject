        <p>THE greatest show in the sky, on the seas, even on earth with side trips to the underworld, is playing on the stage of the McCarter Theater here. It is about a royal hero's very long, spooky and supernatural voyage home. It takes 10 years but he's been away for 20, having served with glory as a warrior and a general for the first 10.</p>
        <p>The hero,returning from the Trojan War, is Odysseus, presumed to be dead, though his loyal wife, Penelope, and son Telemachus say he's just been detained.</p>
        <p>They're right, but what do they know about his post-war perils: encounters with sea monsters with six heads and 12 arms, one-eyed earth monsters who eat people and gods, goddesses and lesser divinities?</p>
        <p>In their long wait, they have to ward off more mundane monsters, like the malevolent, inhumane but technically human devils of superman dimensions. ''Ignorant of civility,'' these macho men are Penelope's so-called suitors.</p>
        <p>But on the level of immediacy, ''The Odyssey,'' in Mary Zimmerman's accessible adaptation and astonishing staging of the Homeric epic (based on a translation by Robert Fitzgerald), is about a man's grand reunion with his son, his wife and finally his father. It is the most dramatic homecoming in world literature.</p>
        <p>And though there have been innumerable efforts to put 300 or so pages, or parts thereof, of an adventure 3,000 or so years old, on film, television and stage, the theater can rightfully claim Ms. Zimmerman's retelling on its own terms.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zimmerman's special creation evolved from a thesis production when she was a graduate student at Northwestern University more than 10 years ago. It was produced at the Goodman Theater in Chicago last year and is to move on to Seattle Repertory Theater after the McCarter run. Such resourceful, brainy theater that honors the power of imagination defines the heart, soul and mission of regional theater.</p>
        <p>Mercifully, Ms. Zimmerman has no pretensions about being scholarly, definitive or complete. This crafty theater artist has made it quite clear that she is out to entice everyone who has ever been bored to death by coercive school assignments and anyone who is likely to recoil at the mention of Homer.</p>
        <p>Last Sunday's matinee lasted more than three hours -- short hours -- and was attended by many evidently enraptured youngsters, escorted by grown-ups similarly in the thrall of a panoramic yet simple display of stagecraft.</p>
        <p>Magical properties do not make for the magic of theater and a great, ripping story is no guarantee that children or adults will listen. But Ms. Zimmerman, the acting ensemble of 21 who appear to be playing at least a thousand roles, and the stage designers and technicians have been blessed by the gift to impart this magic to an audience.</p>
        <p>Daniel Ostling's flowing settings and Michael Bodeen's sound design encompass the renewing calm of Odysseus' homeland, conveyed by the gentle lowering of a lone tree branch with a sprig of leaves, after enveloping sea waves and thunderbolts. Mara Blumenfeld's costumes embrace shimmering ancient tradition and contemporary Sirens in flaming red who could well burst into ''Hey, Big Spender.'' The sight of Aiolos, King of the Winds, decked out in blinding yellow, with sky blue lining, entitles Ms. Blumenfeld to her own revisulaization of ''The Wiz.''</p>
        <p>Even though the seductive Circe's greeting is ''Welcome to my home; don't mind the swine,'' and the almighty blase Zeus observes the proceedings from a stage seat on high, martini in hand, gratuitous anachronisms do not drive the show. Athena (the delightful, extraordinarily agile Mariann Mayberry) drives the plot, and that tells you this is not a standard narration but a real dramatization, an actual play of wit and resonance. Indeed, it is the art -- and the origins -- of storytelling, adorned by theatrical ingenuity, that inform a sumptuous production.</p>
        <p>The victorious Odysseus, whose triumph is truly ''a staggering thing beyond imagining'' is an eternal testament to the possibilities of one man's victory over evil forces. Granted, he has but two allies, ''but their names are Zeus and Athena''.</p>
        <p>Mixing slyness, vulnerability and grace, Christopher Donahue's everyman depiction of a royal hero who has endured unspeakable suffering and humiliation speaks clearly to everyone who is thwarted by the Philistinism of arrogant authority or the banality of bureaucracies in the modern world.</p>
        <p>It is no stretch to feel ''The Odyssey'' -- with the seamless unfurling  of themes of endurance, faith, revenge, healing and redemption -- is an essential morality play and a wondrous love story for today. That's entertainment. And don't forget the children.</p>
        <p>THE ODYSSEY  McCarter Theater, 91 University Place, Princeton.</p>
        <p>Through next Sunday. Today at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Friday at 8 p.m., next Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m. and next Sunday at 2 p.m.  (609) 258-2787.</p>
