      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The city's largest drop-in shelter for the homeless is itself on the brink of homelessness.</p>
        <p>The shelter is run by the Grand Central Neighborhood Social Services Corporation. For more than a year, it has operated from the basement of the Church of St. Agnes on East 43rd Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, near Grand Central Terminal.</p>
        <p>But last week, Msgr. Eugene V. Clark, pastor of the church, returned the shelter's $1,729 rent check, causing shelter officials to wonder if they would be forced onto the street.</p>
        <p>''We don't know what's going to happen to us,'' said Jeff Grunberg, executive director of the corporation. ''We're hoping that we'll find a space.''</p>
        <p>Although the church would like to reclaim its basement, which is used as a lecture hall, Monsignor Clark said Mr. Grunberg's fears were unfounded.</p>
        <p>''We've taken no action, and we've threatened no action,'' Monsignor Clark said. ''Obviously, they're not going to leave until they find a place, and we understand that. We're going to be as patient as possible.''</p>
        <p>The 24-hour drop-in shelter, which serves 200 people a day, opened in 1989 as part of the city's effort to combat homelessness in the area around Grand Central Terminal. It was originally housed in the church's school a block away on 44th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, but was evicted last year when the school was sold to a developer for luxury housing. At that point, the church agreed to house the shelter in its basement temporarily.</p>
        <p>Monsignor Clark said he refused to accept the shelter's rent check because the church had no contract with the shelter for use of the basement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grunberg has been looking for a year for a permanent home. His likeliest option is a building at 34th Street near Lexington Avenue. But residents and business owners in the neighborhood say the shelter is unwelcome.</p>
        <p>''We have more social services than any other community board in the city of New York,'' said Linda Nevins, vice president of the Rosehill Community Association, a local group. ''I think it's too much for our community to absorb. We've done our fair share.''</p>
        <p>The area is home to eight medical institutions, two homeless shelters and nine methadone clinics. Residents fear that another shelter would increase the numbers of homeless.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grunberg disagrees.</p>
        <p>''We know we could help that neighborhood a lot,'' he said.</p>
