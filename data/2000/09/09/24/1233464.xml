        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>As a usually enthusiastic follower of the Olympics, I am so turned off by the incessant advertising breaks that seem to come every five, six minutes, followed by condescending commentary that seeks to make sensational news out of the most mundane facts, I find tuning in simply unbearable. Taping should have made seamless coverage all the easier this year. And, as Australia is 15 hours ahead of New York, why is it so impossible to bring us some events live?</p>
