        <p>THE students march into Atara Serle's weekly dance class with their bodies itching to groove and their feet laced up in gym shoes. But for all their energy and grace, these dance students are not part of the nightclub set. For starters, there are no men allowed here; this mostly Orthodox Jewish troupe frowns upon men and women dancing together. Then there is the unusually modest attire: long skirts, loose fitting blouses, and wigs or hats, in accordance with Orthodox custom. To top it off, the music blaring from the stereo is not on any top hits list, except perhaps that of Hasidic rockers who croon Hebrew or Yiddish numbers.</p>
        <p>Clearly there will be no macarena performed here.</p>
        <p>Instead, these dancers kick up their heels in a complicated series of steps, hops and spins in perfect rhythm with the upbeat music. They are engaged in what is referred to in Jewish circles as simcha dancing. Simcha (pronounced SIM-kuh), which means joy or happiness in Hebrew, also refers to the weddings and bar and bat mitzvahs where the dances are performed.</p>
        <p>Simcha dancing, which updates Israeli folk-dancing steps with lively music and complex choreography, combines tapping, hopping, whirling and clapping with stepping, often at a frantic pace. The style has been around for nearly two decades but has boomed recently. As simcha dancing has gained popularity in Orthodox circles, classes like Ms. Serle's have popped up in Jewish communities around the globe.</p>
        <p>In Long Island, many can be found at synagogues like Congregation Kneseth Israel in Far Rockaway, Beth Shalom in Lawrence and Young Israel of North Woodmere. Other simcha dance classes are taught to boys and girls at elementary and secondary yeshivas such as the Hebrew Academy of Five Towns and Rockaway and Hebrew Academy of Long Beach. And some are taught in the living rooms and basements of simcha dance teachers and choreographers like Ms. Serle, who also leads some 30 classes a week at synagogues, schools, parties and camps.</p>
        <p>On a recent Tuesday night at Congregation Beth Shalom, Ms. Serle led her crew through some intense warmup moves before introducing a new dance, featuring a complex series of kickball chain, grapevine and heel-toe combinations. At first, many kept their eyes glued to their feet until they gained enough confidence to lift their heads and hum to the music. But when the group got rolling -- with feet in perpetual motion and arms swinging in sync -- the enjoyment was unmistakable.</p>
        <p>''It's like kosher aerobics,'' said Carol Lebovic, a West Hempstead grandmother who attends two simcha dance classes a week in addition to regularly playing tennis, swimming and running the treadmill. ''It's a great form of aerobic exercise,'' she said -- a common refrain among the students.</p>
        <p>Participants -- not necessarily Orthodox, and not even necessarily Jewish -- cite a variety of other reasons to join simcha dance class, among them the sheer joy and spirit of the dance routines and the easy camaraderie among students. In Ms. Serle's class, many of the students have studied together for 13 years and giggle at each other's missteps, exchange photos of children and grandchildren, and invite one another to their simchas.</p>
        <p>''I'm not that religious and the people I associate with don't do simcha dancing but I love this class,''. said Joan Vegosen, a special education teacher from Valley Stream. ''It's a very friendly group and the teacher is so enthusiastic.''</p>
        <p>Debby Rosenfeld, a homemaker from Woodmere, chimed in: ''It's a night out with the girls. It's time away from the kids. We sit and schmooze.''</p>
        <p>Lillian Steinberg of West Hempstead said she was drawn to the class because she felt like she had two left feet in a world of Jewish Ginger Rogerses. At simchas, she spent too much time sitting at her table, enviously watching other women glide across the dance floor. ''I really wanted to dance but you don't want to feel like you are fumbling over your feet,'' said Ms. Steinberg, a librarian.</p>
        <p>Today, after 10 years of simcha dance lessons, Ms. Steinberg can seldom be found at her table when the band is playing. More likely, she is on the front lines of the dance floor, lifting her legs high to the music as others follow her lead. ''If any dance comes up, I am comfortable doing it,'' she said proudly.</p>
        <p>Dance has ancient roots in Jewish culture, dating to an era when it was important in celebrating rituals, holidays and weddings. Before the advent of simcha dancing, guests at Jewish weddings often raced around in monotonous circles or performed simple folk dances.</p>
        <p>With the birth of Jewish rock music, which put lyrics from Jewish liturgy to contemporary rhythms, came the cheek-reddening, heart-racing, sweat-inducing Jewish line and circle dancing. Largely choreographed by New York dance teachers and dancers, many simcha dances borrow from Israeli folk, Spanish and Western dance steps and even the Irish tradition made famous by Riverdance. The hottest simcha dances reach other parts of the country through videos, teachers and students who perform them at simchas.</p>
        <p>Although contemporary steps are frequently incorporated into simcha dance, ''certain things (like the macarena) we try to stay away from because they're too provocative,'' said Sima Gefen, a dance teacher and choreographer from Far Rockaway.</p>
        <p>New dances are made up every week. ''As soon as a new song hits the stores or radio, there's a mad rush to create a unique dance to accompany it,'' said Tzirel Goldschmiedt of Far Rockaway, a longtime simcha dance teacher and choreographer.</p>
        <p>While many simcha dancers swear that their hobby is the best prevention for a heart condition, Ms. Goldschmiedt claims its appeal is as much the boost for the body as it is adrenaline for the soul.</p>
        <p>''This is a lot more meaningful than aerobics,'' she said. ''When I sing and dance to these songs, I know what they mean and they have a deeper meaning than other songs.'' For example, when she swings her body to the words ''Modim anachnu lach,'' a Hebrew prayer that means ''We thank you God,'' she ponders her gratitude for the Almighty.</p>
        <p>''Most of these songs praise God or refer to our love for Jerusalem and Israel,'' she said. ''When I dance to this, I can really feel the music.''</p>
