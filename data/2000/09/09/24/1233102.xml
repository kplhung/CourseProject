        <p>IN Mystic in the 1840's, the general store carried all sorts of things, including flour (3 cents a pound), gin (6 cents a pint), green paint (17 cents a pound) and red flannel (40 cents a yard).

        <p>IN Mystic in the 1840's, the general store carried all sorts of things, including flour (3 cents a pound), gin (6 cents a pint), green paint (17 cents a pound) and red flannel (40 cents a yard). Sometimes people paid cash, but often they bartered goods and services. They could get a penny in credit for each egg they brought in, or tar some sled runners for 12 cents.</p>
        <p>Many local people were farmers; others worked in shipyards by the Mystic River. Amos Clift, a carpenter who built several houses in the area, had recently completed the Mystic Fifth District School, or Portersville Academy. There a male schoolmaster was paid $56 a month, while a female teacher made about half as much.</p>
        <p>These days people can get right into all that. The Mystic River Historical Society is offering free, hands-on history programs at its 1839 Portersville Academy building, Sundays through Oct. 8. The aim is to show people what life was like in the first half of the 19th century, but not to be stuffy about it. ''This is informal, participatory,'' said Dorrie Hanna, president of the historical society.</p>
        <p>Besides viewing informative signs and 19th-century artifacts, visitors can select and weigh general store merchandise, assemble a chair, or sew, among other things. Upstairs, in a schoolroom where desks are painted green (the color reported in the local paper when the new district school opened), they can write on slates, play old-fashioned games and meet Miss Williams, the teacher.</p>
        <p>Historical society members portray Miss Williams, and at the first hands-on program, Betty Tylaska, clad in a long blue dress and a tidy white cap, briskly carried out the professional duties of a 19th-century schoolmarm. ''Fold your hands!'' she ordered all who sat down at the green desks. ''Keep your feet on the floor!''</p>
        <p>Actually, she was having a very good time, as were her students. Sara Halsey, 5, even played pickup sticks with her. David Porter, a retired mathematician, wisely stood at attention as soon as he entered the schoolroom. ''You know how to behave,'' observed Miss Williams, who drew a line on the blackboard. Anyone who didn't behave, she said, would have to stand with his or her nose pressed against that line.</p>
        <p>Downstairs, visitors eyed the adz, awl, clamps and other old tools in the area called Amos Clift's Workshop.</p>
        <p>Donald Simpson, a historical society volunteer, noted pieces of wood joined with wooden dowels. ''Nails were hard to come by and very expensive,'' he said. ''Wooden dowels were used a lot.'' According to a sign on the wall, ''Boys as young as 8 or 9 would have been proficient in the use of all the tools dislayed here and would have been responsible for many carpentry repairs in their homes.''</p>
        <p>In the Sally Ann Fish sewing room -- actually, a small area packed with quilting patterns, sewing supplies and tables where visitors can get to work -- Keith Hall also faced a challenge. Carefully threading a big needle with yarn, he gave a brief sewing demonstration for his wife, Tonya, and their daughters, Isabella, 5, Arianna, 2 1/2, and Evaliese, 7 months. The quilting patterns displayed, donated by a local family, were from the 1840's and were made mostly of scrap paper that had apparently been used for practice in penmanship and arithmetic as well.</p>
        <p>At the general store (complete with an apothecary), big barrels contain flour, rice, beans and seed. But unlike such barrels in an actual 19th-century store, these have shallow bottoms, and the merchandise is only inches deep. Bins hold some onions, apples and squash; a washtub and washboard hang on the wall; shelves hold rolls of flannel and other fabric. Also available are candy, tobacco and baking equipment. Sara Halsey tried out a rolling pin. ''Can we buy this?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>''No, it's just pretend,'' her mother, Sally Halsey, explained.</p>
        <p>While many things are for display, others are there to be handled. Mrs. Hanna noted that while 19th-century folks sometimes paid cash for what they needed, ''More commonly, they would barter, or they could work it off.'' Price sheets, recorded from the daybook of a local general store of the period, provide information (bushel of oats, 37 cents; pair of suspenders, 10 cents) for visitors who want to get into the swing of things.</p>
        <p>Sara, Caroline and other children tried to weigh candy, beans and more on the balance scale, a tricky business. ''I think, if you put this in a certain place . . .'' said Caroline, as she tried to center a metal weight on one side of the scale.</p>
        <p>Hands-on history is the brainchild of Helen Keith, a historical society member who thought that some aspects of local history were a bit neglected and who also figured that youngsters and adults alike would be more interested in actually doing things than in just peering at tidily arranged artifacts.</p>
        <p>''We're concentrating on the early part of the 19th century, when Mystic went from being a dozen scattered farmhouses to being a thriving, shipbuilding metropolis. That's not much touched upon,'' said Mrs. Keith.</p>
        <p>She added that Mystic's maritime history is well represented at Mystic Seaport, so historical society members have focused on other topics. They've also aimed to show people Portersville Academy itself, so long a fixture in Mystic -- though a move in 1887 put it a few blocks southeast of where Mr. Clift built it. After its years as a school, it was used as a District Hall, but it had fallen into disrepair by 1975 when historical society members raised money to buy and restore it.</p>
        <p>They began hands-on history on Labor Day weekend, as they planned, even though other projects kept them from starting to work on it before July. ''We really did a lot in two months,'' said Mrs. Keith, adding that about a dozen people did the actual work. Several local residents lent or donated material; a historical society member made games and the society spent about $1,200, mostly to buy reproduction items, like the balance scale in the general store, for visitors' use.</p>
        <p>''This is a trial run,'' said Mrs. Keith, of the new program at Portersville Academy. The unheated building isn't used during the winter, but if all goes well, the historical society hopes that hands-on history will continue next spring and summer.</p>
        <p>Hands-on history programs are at the Portersville Academy, 74 High Street, Mystic, (860) 536-4779, from 1 to 4 p.m. on Sundays through Oct. 8. Admission is free.</p>
