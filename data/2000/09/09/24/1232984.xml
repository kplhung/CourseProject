        <p>Eve MacSweeney interviews Max Wigram, co-curator of London's Royal Academy of Arts new 'Apocalypse' show; photos (M) (special section, Men's Fashions of The Times) (part 2 of 2-part section)</p>

        <p>It's that time again. London's Royal Academy of Arts, which generated the much-ballyhooed ''Sensation'' exhibition in Brooklyn last year, has now unveiled the equally throat-grabbing ''Apocalypse,'' a show cheerily subtitled ''Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art.''</p>
        <p>Instrumental in picking the 13 international artists whose worldview fit this description was Max Wigram, chosen by the academy's Norman Rosenthal to be his co-curator. An artist, art history graduate and former Bruce Weber model who ran a noncommercial artists' space in the mid-90's, Wigram, 34, is used to navigating the choppy waters of shock and pop culture that flow through the current landscape of contemporary art. ''Artists use shock as a material now,'' he says. ''It's a dangerous game to play because if you can't back it up with content, it's just gratuitous. Good art has to stand up to every form of criticism.''</p>

        <p>Instrumental in picking the 13 international artists whose worldview fit this description was Max Wigram, chosen by the academy's Norman Rosenthal to be his co-curator. An artist, art history graduate and former Bruce Weber model who ran a noncommercial artists' space in the mid-90's, Wigram, 34, is used to navigating the choppy waters of shock and pop culture that flow through the current landscape of contemporary art. ''Artists use shock as a material now,'' he says. ''It's a dangerous game to play because if you can't back it up with content, it's just gratuitous. Good art has to stand up to every form of criticism.''</p>
        <p>Wigram sought out fresh pastures of apprehension in the work of Gregor Schneider, a German artist who builds gruesomely suggestive rooms within rooms, and a debut artwork about sex and domestic violence by Chris Cunningham, the video director known for his work with Madonna, Bjork and Aphex Twin. ''Apocalypse'' is not without its ambiguous charms -- witness the Turner Prize contender Wolfgang Tillmans's brooding sunsets, below right -- but the show is clearly not for the faint-hearted.</p>
        <p>Is he concerned about the response? ''It depends on how I wake up in the morning,'' Wigram says. ''Sometimes I think, Oh my God, what on earth's going to go off this time? But this work is so good. And if I really wanted to shock people, I could do it, let me tell you.''</p>
