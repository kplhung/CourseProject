        <p>THE HORSE FAIR</p>
        <p>Poems.</p>
        <p>By Robin Becker.</p>
        <p>University of Pittsburgh, paper, $12.95.</p>
        <p>In her previous book, ''All-American Girl'' (1996), Robin Becker wrote with blistering honesty about her Judaism, complicated relationships and unconventional sexuality. She proved to be a poet who fearlessly plumbed the kinds of events and emotions most of us spend our days trying to forget. In ''The Horse Fair,'' which takes its name from a painting by the 19th-century French painter Rosa Bonheur, Becker seems to have found a kind of bittersweet peace for herself. Throughout this collection, Becker offers paeans to animals, lovers and family members; to the civic-minded friend who teaches her ''the artfulness of love's responsibilities''; and to the ''unlovely'' basset hound, ''legless as a walrus,'' that teaches her ''to pursue my life with devotion.'' She even expresses gratitude for middle age, for ''a body that could feel / this simple balance, some might call indifference, / a form of moderation unfamiliar to the angry and ambitious.'' The poet is in a forgiving state of mind, yet old wounds linger. In ''Late Words for My Sister,'' Becker recalls the abuse the girls once suffered at the hands of their father. ''How our four thin legs danced / up and down on the bed like / the jointed limbs of marionettes / while the burning lariat of his anger / seared our legs.'' Becker is just as bold when venturing into erotic terrain, as in ''Sonnet to the Imagination,'' where she addresses a female lover: ''I want your mouth / on my mouth and wonder where this wanting will lead / if we let it wander, darling, as I wonder who / you will be after my imagination has ravished you.'' This generous poet is never less than attentive and responsive to the world that surrounds her.</p>
