        <p>THE man sitting in the comfortable, plush chair was dressed in black. His graying hair was longish, and when he smiled there was a knowing twinkle in his eyes. Behind him in the large room was a complete view of the bay and a table overflowing with framed photos spanning numerous decades. Though British, he has made his home in Oyster Bay for some 20 years.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's, he spent a good deal of his time in England, surrounded by international intrigue, adventure, exotic women and other elements associated with the world of Her Majesty's Secret Service. His initials are J. B., but he's not James Bond. The name is Barry, John Barry.</p>
        <p>Beginning with the first Bond movie, ''Dr. No,'' in 1962, through 1987's ''Living Daylights, John Barry supplied almost all the music. And that represents only a portion of his career.</p>
        <p>Starting with ''Beat Girl'' in 1959, Mr. Barry has been scoring, composing, producing and creating the overall musical sound for many films. Nominated for seven Academy Awards over the last 40 years, Mr. Barry won for his work on ''Born Free,'' ''The Lion in Winter,'' ''Out of Africa'' and ''Dances With Wolves.'' He also won the Anthony Asquith Award for Original Film Music in 1968 from the British Academy Awards for the ''The Lion in Winter.''</p>
        <p>The films and directors with whom Mr. Barry has been involved includes ''The Knack'' with the director Richard Lester, ''The Chase'' with Arthur Penn, ''Midnight Cowboy'' with John Schlesinger, ''A Clockwork Orange'' with Stanley Kubrick, ''The Tamarind Seed'' with Blake Edwards, ''Shampoo'' with Hal Ashby, ''The Deep'' with Peter Yates, ''Night Games'' with Roger Vadim, ''Body Heat'' with Lawrence Kasdan, ''Hammett'' with Wim Wenders, ''The Cotton Club'' with Francis Ford Coppola and ''Chaplin'' with Sir Richard Attenborough. In addition, Mr. Barry has worked on television shows, commercials and scores of instrumental albums. He has made appearances at concerts and has worked such diverse musical talents as Shirley Bassey and Chrissie Hynde. He is an artist who has quietly become one of the giants of music and film in the last 40 years.</p>
        <p>Meeting Mr. Barry in his large living room -- surrounded by the piano at which he has written all of his music for the past 20 years, a small selection of his gold records, shelves bursting with compact discs and a huge coffee table piled high with current hard-cover books -- is an unusual experience. Unusual because Mr. Barry seems almost unaware of his importance in the music world.</p>
        <p>Film-music making was something Mr. Barry always knew he would do. ''I never knew anything else,'' he said in his easygoing way. His father owned movie houses in England and since he was a little boy, he, his brother and sister were always around them, often working in them. ''I didn't think anyone did anything else,'' he said with a chuckle. ''That was the life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barry began studying piano at age 9, and eventually took up the trumpet. That led to his playing trumpet in dance bands and, eventually, in his John Barry Seven. Then musical composition studies and his playing in the military band in the British Army enhanced his musical education. As a result, he knew early on what his destiny was. ''I always wanted to be a movie composer,'' he said, and cited the composers Max Stern, Erich Korngold and Franz Waxman, as well as the jazz band innovator Stan Kenton, as early influences.</p>
        <p>Following his work producing English pop acts like Adam Faith and writing music for several small movies, Mr. Barry was asked to write an arrangement for the James Bond theme song for ''Dr. No,'' composed by Monty Norman. As a result of the success of that work and his work on the second Bond film, ''From Russia With Love,'' he quickly became one of the most demanded film composer in England in the 60's.The British film industry was coming into its own with directors like David Lean Tony Richardson, Jack Clayton, John Schlesinger, Karel Reisz and Lindsay Anderson and such young actors as Sean Connery, Peter Sellers, Peter O'Toole, Richard Burton, Dudley Moore, Oliver Reed, Robert Shaw and his friend Michael Caine.</p>
        <p>''Michael and I are still very close,'' Mr. Barry commented. ''Back then Michael and Terry Stamp and I hung together. It was a terrific time.''</p>
        <p>But the center of Mr. Barry's early success was the James Bond films, of which he is still very proud. ''It became the most successful series in movie history,'' he remarked. ''It was so fresh. The Bond girls, Ken Adams's sets, the tongue-in-cheek humor. It was a terrific mix and it just kept going on and on. They didn't preview the movies because they knew what they had. It was the first time an English movie had broken out on a world market. It was terrific to be associated with.''</p>
        <p>In contrast with his work on the Bond films and such thrillers as ''The Ipcress File'' and ''The Quiller Memorandum,'' Mr. Barry has also had success with films dominated by the grandeur of nature, like ''Born Free,'' ''The Lion In Winter,'' ''Out of Africa'' and ''Dances With Wolves.''</p>
        <p>''I'm drawn to that kind of subject,'' Mr. Barry said. ''Those kinds of movies are great for music. The music is the language of the spirit of the animals. When you get involved in a movie like that, the opportunity is very broad and very unrestricted.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barry enjoys translating emotions into music. ''I like to score the inner feelings of a character -- get into their shoes in an imaginative way and take the audience there and enlighten them in a poetic rather than realistic way.''</p>
        <p>Despite his having roots in Britain and being much in demand in Hollywood, Mr. Barry has been quite content living in Oyster Bay since 1979. He and his wife, Laurie, were looking for a place in Manhattan and visited Alan Jay Lerner, with whom Mr. Barry had worked on a musical stage version of ''Lolita,'' and lived nearby. They live here with their son, and although they also have a flat in London, they appear to have no plans of ever leaving the area.</p>
        <p>As to whether Mr. Barry will ever be involved with James Bond films again, he said: ''I doubt it. They've changed so much. I think it would be wrong to go back. They were what they were.''</p>
        <p>When asked about the recent Austin Powers films, Mr. Barry appeared amused. ''How do you spoof a spoof?'' he asked. Despite the inclusion on the soundtracks of many 60's sounds, lots of music influenced by Mr. Barry and even music by Burt Bacharach, a contemporary, Mr. Barry was not approached to be involved. His next project will be a nonsoundtrack instrumental album of Celtic music (coincidentally, the next James Bond movie is to be filmed in Ireland), a follow-up to ''The Beyondness of Things'' and ''Playing by Heart.''</p>
        <p>Also, in October ''Somewhere In Time'' will be released in a special 20th anniversary edition. The haunting soundtrack is Mr. Barry's best-selling score.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barry feels the use of music that has nothing to do with a particular film, or of music ''inspired by the film'' as part of a film's soundtrack, makes no sense. He believes, however, that film music may become more of an art form again. When asked about his feelings on the growth of independent film in the past 10 years, he mentioned a Woody Allen film that he considers the best recent moviehe has seen: ''I enjoyed 'Sweet and Lowdown.'' I laughed, and it was beautifully made. It was terrific, especially Sean Penn.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barry said that next year he may be very busy with some film projects in England. He admitted, ''I still get excited to get the chance to do music for a great movie.''</p>
