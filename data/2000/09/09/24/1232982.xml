        <p>Today, the celebration of youth is completely ingrained in our culture, and many men seem determined not to grow up at all. For years, designers have paraded increasingly adolescent styles down the runways. The cropped pants and sleeveless T-shirts of last summer seemed to represent a new low in pandering to our craving for the Fountain of Youth.</p>
        <p>But given the perversity factor in fashion, now is exactly the moment for designers to have a big change of heart.</p>
        <p>Inspired by an interest in all things from the 80's (remember ''Dynasty,'' ''Wall Street'' and power suits?), the fashion flock has reconsidered the concept of dressing like a grown-up. Suits and ties are back, and even sportswear is dressier and more put together. Whether this change on the runway is for real or just a quirky turn of events doesn't matter. We decided to seize the moment.</p>
        <p>There are countless rituals associated with coming of age. We've touched upon some of them in this issue, from the first shave to the first set of wheels. In our fashion feature with Jamie Foxx, we examine some of the more significant moments in a man's life. And what man has not endured the eighth circle of hell when, like Griffin Dunne, he bought his first gift for a lady -- and it was wrong?</p>
        <p>Tests of manhood, once an important part of the growing-up process, are no longer required in most Western countries. But we've found a few good men determined to carry on the tradition. The writer Stanley Bing tackled boxing to get a jump on the corporate competition, and Andrea Tremolada, an advertising executive at Versace, lived to tell Sarah Raper Larenaudie what it's like to fly close to the sun.</p>
        <p>Then, too, why do explorers endure incredible hardships, if not to prove their manhood in the most basic way? In ''Lost Horizons,'' the artists and photographers Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick have imagined an expedition to Iceland, requiring guts and a caravan of manly clothes, from sporty tweeds to functional gear. Ironically, Kahn and Selesnick, both in their 30's, have found a profession that allows them to play make-believe for a living.</p>
        <p>Of course, acting is even more about make-believe, but some actors do graduate from playing boys to portraying men, as evidenced by Tobey Maguire, who donned a very grown-up suit for our cameras.</p>
        <p>Finally, we thought it would be interesting to observe the aging process firsthand, so we drove over to Astoria, Queens, to visit with three generations of the Acierno family. Growing up -- and old -- has affected all of their lives, and for the better, they say.</p>
        <p>So to the question: to grow up or not to grow up? I'll venture my own opinion. Personally, I'd vote for a youthful outlook, concealed by a more sophisticated -- dare I say adult? -- exterior. When you dress like a grown-up, you not only look better but you also improve the quality of life for those around you.</p>
