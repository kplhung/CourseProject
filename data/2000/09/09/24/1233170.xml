        <p>MORE often than not, people complain about real estate. Everything is too expensive or not good enough; brokers are duplicitous or uncaring. It's so common for even privileged New Yorkers to make whiny, ironic or cynical comments that it's surprising to hear Bill and Georgia Levis talk about their new place in Chelsea.</p>
        <p>Finding it was fun. ''We looked all over,'' said Dr. Bill Levis, a physician. ''There were so many nice places.'' They loved their broker, Lisa Wong of Douglas Elliman, and the three have become good friends.</p>
        <p>''She's the reason we're here,'' said Dr. Georgia Levis, a research scientist, with obvious gratitude, sitting in the elegant high-ceilinged living room of their new loft. The couple admire the workmanship that went into the building, the Chelsea Mercantile at Seventh Avenue at 24th Street.</p>
        <p>And they can't give enough compliments to the professionalism of the staff. ''The doorman picks up my packages and walks me in and pushes the bell of the elevator,'' she said. ''I've never been so spoiled in my life. They couldn't be any nicer.'' To prove just how wonderful the staff is, they ask the superintendent to come by to meet their guests.</p>
        <p>With their boundless energy, the couple are in some ways typical of immigrants to Manhattan. They're smart and ambitious and seemingly ready to consume everything the city has to offer. He has found a regular pickup basketball game at the McBurney Y around the corner; she has flung herself into art, and some of her work -- frescoes and gold-leaf paintings on glass in the Renaissance style -- line the sill of one window.</p>
        <p>But unlike many immigrants, they did not leave behind lives in Ohio or Omaha or Odessa. They've lived in the city for 20 years, in Staten Island, where they worked and raised three children. A year ago, they began thinking about the fact that their big house would soon be much quieter.</p>
        <p>The youngest child, Laura, was starting her final year of high school and would be going away to college. Staten Island had been a great place to live, but they felt it was time to move on. ''We like concerts, we like plays,'' said Bill Levis, a dermatologist who runs the Hansen's Disease program, which treats about 500 people who have leprosy, at the Staten Island University Hospital. ''We just like the city.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Georgia Levis is a cellular immunologist at the New York State Institute for Basic Research for Developmental Disabilities, in Staten Island, and studies the interaction of the brain and the immune system. ''We fell in love over a microscope,'' she said, when they were doing a project on cancer-causing genetic diseases at the National Institutes of Health.</p>
        <p>With the help of their friend the broker, they started looking last fall for a place in the city, a place that would put them near the Village, where after two years with a pied-a-terre on Mercer Street, they knew they felt comfortable. ''We like wearing our shorts and flip-flops,'' she said.</p>
        <p>THEY looked at the lofts in the Chelsea Mercantile when the building still required visitors to wear hard hats, and they selected a 2,400-square-foot condo on the second floor for $1.225 million, with monthly carrying costs, including taxes, of about $2,200. They moved in during July, and by the end of August, when their daughter was getting ready to go to college at Emerson College in Boston, they were settled.</p>
        <p>Much of the decorating had been done by Georgia Levis's mother, Mary Jo Barnett, who for years had worked as a disk jockey in a small town in West Virginia. When her husband died, she packed a suitcase and headed for New York, where she spent two years getting a degree in interior design before moving back home. It is that gumption that her daughter finds inspiring, and instructive in her move toward a different kind of life.</p>
        <p>When they left Staten Island, Georgia Levis said, she gave away most of her possessions and furniture, because although their loft is large, it's less than half the size of their house. ''It felt great, like I was freeing myself up,'' she said. Her mother's move to New York two weeks after her father's death taught her a lesson, she said: that ''you're not your stuff.''</p>
        <p>Although both of them seem eager to take on Manhattan, her passion for art seems to have driven much of their move. The pied-a-terre -- found by Ms. Wong -- was ''my way to get Bill into Manhattan, to soften him up for the kill,'' Georgia Levis said. He seems to have survived the pressure; they sit close to each other on the couch, and their broker, who is engaged to be married, marvels at how they still act like teenagers in love.</p>
        <p>When they are home, he spends much of his evening reading medical journals, often related to his specialty in leprosy. Science has not lost its lure for her; she started cutting up worms at age 3, and still remembers her first try at a date. ''I was 12,'' she said. ''I brought him to my house to dissect a bat. I was madly in love. He ran off. My mother told me it wouldn't work.'' These days, she is an expert in an amino acid called taurine and its modulation of the immune system.</p>
        <p>Still, her new passion is art, and in her free time she paints in the third bedroom, her studio. She always painted as a child, but only in the last two years did she singlemindedly pursue it, seeking out teachers and trying a variety of techniques. She does works on glass and on canvas, often making her own materials just as they were made in the 14th century.</p>
        <p>''Because of my background in science, what I really like is the process,'' she said. Creating materials is like working in the lab. ''I'll come in and she's cooking rabbit-skin glue,'' her daughter Laura said.</p>
        <p>On a tour of the apartment, Georgia Levis pointed out the art she collects by West Virginia painters, a Rembrandt etching she found in an auction in Europe, and her own varied works, of angels and Jesus, of nudes, and most recently, of American Indians, because she is part Cherokee.</p>
        <p>The couple still have a few things to do before they are totally settled; in the den they plan to build shelves to house his collection of armadillos in many materials, including one real shell. ''That's the animal model for leprosy,'' she said. ''It's the only animal it grows in. We have a major collection of armadillos.''</p>
        <p>The master bedroom looks out onto a planted area with a fountain, which seems like it would have helped sell the place. But it almost sent her running. ''I was afraid it would be like a drip, like a Chinese water torture,'' she said. Fortunately, the sound is very soothing, because the bedroom is important to her. ''Sleeping is my third hobby,'' she said, only partly joking. ''I really believe that sleep and meditation give you energy.''</p>
        <p>Her daughter's departure, she said, is a mixed blessing. ''You teach them to walk, and walk away.'' But for her, it's also a new phase. ''I can't wait to see every art gallery,'' she said, ''and to go to my science meetings without feeling guilty. It's so great here. To be anonymous. It's thrilling.''</p>
