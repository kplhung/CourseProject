        <p>Larry Dierker managed Houston to division championships in each of his first three seasons with the Astros. In this, his fourth season, the Astros have played badly, and Dierker is said in baseball circles to be in danger of losing his job.</p>
        <p>Buck Showalter managed the Arizona Diamondbacks to a division championship in their second season, making them the most successful baseball expansion team in history. The Diamondbacks, however, have not only failed to repeat, but have also played too poorly to make the playoffs as the wild-card team, and Showalter is said to be in danger of losing his job.</p>
        <p>Johnny Oates managed the Texas Rangers to division championships three of the past four seasons. This season, however, the Rangers are in last place, and rumors say Oates is in danger of losing his job.</p>
        <p>As the regular season begins its final week, more than half a dozen managers, Dierker and Showalter among them, are perilously perched on the precipice of dismissal. Oates, however, is not teetering there. Tom Hicks, the Rangers' owner, said recently that Oates would continue as the manager.</p>
        <p>Felipe Alou, the venerable manager of the Montreal Expos, is another whose status was rumored to be in question, but Jeffrey Loria, the team's managing partner, said that was news to him.</p>
        <p>''I've never said that,'' Loria said. ''I've never said I want to make a change. Felipe's the manager. He's under contract, an enormous contract. I've never entertained any other ideas other than saying we'll take a look at everything at the end of the season.''</p>
        <p>Loria added, ''He's not in trouble.''</p>
        <p>Dusty Baker and Lou Piniella are not in trouble, either. In fact, they are managers in the enviable position of being free agents after the season. Their contracts expire, and they have not signed extensions.</p>
        <p>San Francisco wants Baker to remain, and he most likely will stay. He has been wise, though, to see how far the Giants go in the postseason before signing. The farther they go, the higher his salary figures to go.</p>
        <p>''Dusty has made it clear he prefers to wait until the end of the season to focus on his business issues,'' Jeff Moorad, Baker's adviser, said. ''We're acutely aware of his attraction around the major leagues and I'm certain if he showed himself to be available that we'd have a number of teams interested. I'm not sure that's the intent. In fact, it's fair to say he's inclined to stay in San Francisco as long as the terms of a deal were fair and appropriate.''</p>
        <p>The only negative aspect of continuing the relationship was suggested by another club's executive. ''I've heard rumblings that Dusty doesn't want to be with Barry Bonds,'' the executive said.</p>
        <p>Piniella is not so certain to remain in Seattle, where he has managed for eight years. He has not said what he prefers, but the most popular speculation has him desiring to manage at home, meaning Tampa Bay. The Devil Rays, however, are not the contending team Piniella has become accustomed to managing.</p>
        <p>''His focus is totally on winning the pennant and hopefully getting to the World Series,'' said Alan Nero, his agent. ''We've all agreed not to think about it or talk about it now. Lou has incredible loyalty to the Seattle ownership and fans. He would like to hear what they have to say first and then decide what he's going to do.''</p>
        <p>Seattle's Pat Gillick sounded like a general manager who wanted to retain his manager.</p>
        <p>''If you're grading guys on the type of season they've had,'' Gillick said, ''Lou's had a great season, not only from the standpoint of handling players but running the games. He's had an all-star year. I've never seen him so much under control. He has mellowed and matured.''</p>
        <p>Part of the Piniella speculation involves Jimy Williams of Boston. Piniella, the scenario goes, would leave the Mariners, whose general manager, Gillick, has a good relationship from their Toronto days with Williams, who would ask out of the remaining year of his contract with the Red Sox or be fired because he and the Boston general manager, Dan Duquette, are less than friendly.</p>
        <p>When the scenario was mentioned to Williams recently, he said he knew nothing about it. ''I have a contract for next year,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the relationship between Williams and Duquette became more strained in recent days when Duquette defended Carl Everett, Boston's center fielder, after he arrived late for a game. ''If I was the general manager, I would back the manager,'' Williams told reporters in Boston yesterday, ''and if you can't, you probably need to get rid of me.''</p>
        <p>In about every instance where a manager's position is precarious, the team owner or general manager has said the club will evaluate or address everything at the end of the season. That statement covers Dierker, Showalter, Gene Lamont of Pittsburgh, Terry Francona of Philadelphia, Larry Rothschild of Tampa Bay and Davey Johnson of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Jim Bowden, the Cincinnati general manager, offered a variation on the theme when asked about Jack McKeon. ''Jack's our manager, and I have no other comment,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Baseball executives would consider it a major upset if McKeon, Francona, Rothschild, Johnson or Lamont survived. In Lamont's case, Kevin McClatchy, the owner, has reportedly already told him he will not remain in the Pirates' job.</p>
        <p>''We'll address Geno's situation at the end of the season, which is not that far away,'' McClatchy said. ''Any discussions between Gene and me are confidential.''</p>
        <p>Ed Wade, general manager of the last-place Phillies, said the club had ''had high expectations coming off our offensive performance last year,'' adding: ''Things have not developed the way we expected. We're hugely disappointed.''</p>
        <p>The situation in Los Angeles is interesting because the apparent desire of General Manager Kevin Malone to change managers is compounded by the possibility that Malone himself could be fired.</p>
        <p>''Our situation is being evaluated at this time,'' Malone said. ''There's been no decisions made. We're pleased with the way we've performed the last week or two. Unfortunately, we waited until this late date.''</p>
        <p>Gerry Hunsicker of Houston sounded like a general manager who wanted to keep his manager, but Dierker's future will be determined by the owner, Drayton McLane Jr.</p>
        <p>''I think sometimes we can jump to conclusions before we know what the real issues are,'' McLane said. ''We want to take everything into consideration. We'll make a decision very quickly, in the first week after the season.''</p>
        <p>Dierker's position could be undermined by reports that some of his players don't take him seriously and don't want to play for him.</p>
        <p>''It's not any different from any clubhouse,'' Hunsicker said when asked about the reports. ''I think it's the nature of the beast. These things surface when you lose.''</p>
        <p>Players do not apparently like Showalter in Arizona, even though, like Dierker, he managed them to a first-place finish. Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondbacks' managing partner, has said he will wait until the end of the season before making a decision, but the team's collapse the last five weeks can't help Showalter.</p>
        <p>Even the elder statesman among managers is not certain of his status. Tom Kelly has managed the Minnesota Twins for 14 seasons, winning the World Series in 1987 and '91, but does not know if he will make it to 15.</p>
        <p>''They haven't informed me if they want me to come back,'' said Kelly, who is in the last year of his contract and wants to stay with the Twins. ''Three years ago, they asked me to stay and take on this undertaking. Now we're starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel and I feel like I'd like to do this some more. But we haven't heard anything. I'm hoping to hear something in the next few days, because I have some coaches I need to take care of. Whether we're staying or leaving, I'd like to get it resolved in the next few days or a week. If they don't want us back, fine; we'll get along. If they do, good; let's get going.''</p>
        <p>No In-Season Changes Yet</p>
        <p>Barring an unexpected development, the season will end without any teams changing managers. It would be the first time since 1942 such a development occurred, and there were only 16 teams then.</p>
        <p>Jim Bowden of Cincinnati attributed the novelty to baseball economics.</p>
        <p>''I think a lot of it has to do with the economic disparity we have right now,'' he said. ''The expectations for each manager are different from what they have been in the past. Small-market teams can't have the same expectations for those managers as you once did. Before, most of the teams had a chance to win, and expectations were greater for each manager. People are more realistic now.''</p>
        <p>Gerry Hunsicker of Houston said clubs might be viewing the job more rationally than before.</p>
        <p>''Maybe they're realizing that firing managers doesn't change a whole lot of the results,'' he said. ''It's amazing how managers become extremely smart when they have talent and extremely stupid when they don't have talent.''</p>
        <p>Doug Melvin, the Texas general manager, suggested that some clubs might not have acted because they could not come up with suitable replacements. ''A lot of guys don't want to take jobs on an interim basis,'' Melvin said. ''They want the job from Day 1 of spring training.''</p>
        <p>It is entirely possible that if one team had fired its manager sometime this season, others would have followed. Often in the past clubs wanted to make a change but did not want to be the first to do it. When another team fired its manager, those other teams then did likewise.</p>
