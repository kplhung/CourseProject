        <p>A 52-year-old man from Greenridge, Staten Island, has tested positive for the West Nile virus, the 12th case reported so far this year in New York City, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday in a news conference at City Hall.</p>
        <p>The man, whose identity was not revealed, was hospitalized on Tuesday after complaining of flu-like symptoms, including fevers, headaches, joint and muscle pains and dizziness as early as last month. He remained in stable condition yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The man was the ninth resident of Staten Island to test positive for the virus, though it is unclear where he may have been infected. ''The virus is so prevalent in Staten Island that certainly it could be anywhere,'' said the city's health commissioner, Neal L. Cohen, who appeared with the mayor.</p>
        <p>Of the 12 people infected with the virus, 8 have returned home while 4 remain hospitalized, the mayor said. He added that the city would continue spraying to counter mosquitoes carrying the virus until at least mid-October.</p>
        <p>The spraying in Central Park was completed Friday night.</p>
