        <p>THE man who by many accounts was the most innovative, respected and controversial executive in modern aviation until his retirement in 1998 -- Robert L. Crandall -- is now re-entering the business from a new angle, tackling the fallout from one of his best-known brainchildren.</p>
        <p>In 1981, Mr. Crandall oversaw development of the first frequent-flier program as president of American Airlines, where he  later became chairman and chief executive. The program, an immediate hit, went on to  transform airline marketing.</p>
        <p>Today, the mile has become a sort of shadow currency, awarded or honored by many businesses, including hotels, car rental agencies and even phone companies and credit card issuers. With the boom in travel,  the number of unredeemed miles outstanding has shot up into the trillions, by some estimates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crandall, 64, is now affiliated, as an investor and adviser, with MilePoint.com, a new venture meant to help mop up some of those miles. The service, due to start next month, lets participants in the loyalty programs of Delta, Northwest, Continental, U S Airways, America West, T.W.A. and Hilton Hotels redeem their miles for discounts on merchandise instead of airline tickets or hotel rooms. MilePoint will earn fees from both the loyalty program sponsors and participating retailers. (American Airlines, part of AMR, plans its own miles-for-merchandise offering with America Online.)</p>
        <p>In a series of telephone conversations, Mr. Crandall spoke from his homes in Gloucester, Mass., and in Dallas about the evolution of frequent-flier programs and the future of travel marketing. Here are excerpts.</p>
        <p>JANE L. LEVERE</p>
        <p>Q.  How have mileage programs changed the way people fly?</p>
        <p>A.  For infrequent fliers, miles continue to be an enormously powerful incentive to travel on a particular airline; by putting all their travel in a single place, they can accumulate enough miles for a trip. However, for frequent fliers who belong to lots of plans, it's less important to be on airline A or airline B for a particular trip. But the concept of getting something for nothing continues to have a great fascination and is a powerful incentive for people to join programs.</p>
        <p>Q.  Have the accumulations of unredeemed miles taken airlines by surprise? Are they a  serious problem?</p>
        <p>A.  I don't think anyone anticipated the overwhelming success of the plans. I don't think airlines are concerned about it. But I do think they're anxious to find ways to liquidate their liability.</p>
        <p>MilePoint charges airlines to liquidate their miles much less than it would cost them to deliver seats. And the commission that retailers pay us is a whole lot less than they would have to spend on advertising to find qualified customers.</p>
        <p>Q.  Programs run by American Express, Diners Club and others let customers redeem points or miles for the full price of goods. So will American and AOL in their new joint program. Why would consumers use MilePoint and settle for just a discount?</p>
        <p>A.  Those programs have a catalog approach -- you can trade in your miles only for items in their catalogs, and you have to pay a lot more for them than you otherwise would. With MilePoint, you use miles as real dollars to buy things for publicly stated prices.</p>
        <p>Q.  Is the Internet transforming the marketing of travel the way loyalty programs did?</p>
        <p>A.  As the Internet gets faster and more reliable and becomes easier to use, as Internet-access appliances get more reliable and cheaper, people will buy more and more of what they buy online. Travel is likely to be a category of consumption where virtually all transactions will be online; it's hard to imagine why anyone would use paper.</p>
        <p>Q.  Do you miss running an airline?</p>
        <p>A.  I had a terrific time running American. I was very fond of the high energy level and of the rapid pace of change of the airline business. But it was a very consuming kind of thing. I grew very weary of the conflicts with the unions and of the uninformed, politically-inspired commentary of folks in Washington. I reached a point where I'd rather be doing this than that.</p>
