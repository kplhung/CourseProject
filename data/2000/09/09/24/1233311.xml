        <p>EDDIE IRVINE, winner of four Formula One Grand Prix races, left no doubt at Saks Fifth Avenue's breast cancer benefit on Tuesday night that he is one of the fastest men on earth. In less than 20 minutes, he hit on Christy Turlington and Miss Universe.</p>

        <p>EDDIE IRVINE, winner of four Formula One Grand Prix races, left no doubt at Saks Fifth Avenue's breast cancer benefit on Tuesday night that he is one of the fastest men on earth. In less than 20 minutes, he hit on Christy Turlington and Miss Universe.</p>
        <p>''Are you Miss World?'' asked Mr. Irvine, who is Irish and not shy.</p>
        <p>''No, I'm Miss Universe.''</p>
        <p>''Oh, I was a judge at the last Miss World,'' he said. ''I'm Eddie.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Irvine, 34, was without a doubt the biggest celebrity at the Saks party whom nobody knew. The 17 Formula One Grand Prix races this year will be watched by a cumulative audience of five billion people. But here in this fishbowl of New York media and society he went virtually unrecognized. Ms. Turlington knew who he was: supermodels and Formula One drivers belong to the same global V.I.P. club. They had met once, in Dublin eight years ago. Eager to renew their acquaintance, Mr. Irvine elicited a promise from her to watch him race his Jaguar in the first Grand Prix in the United States since 1991.</p>
        <p>The race is today. A sinuous Formula One track has been cut into the big oval of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where a sold-out crowd of more than 200,000 will fill the stands. Cable's Speedvision and the Fox Sports Network will cover the event live at 2 p.m.</p>
        <p>How many viewers will tune in is another question. And will a country that let Grand Prix racing fizzle out nine years ago and that has no American-born Formula One drivers care?</p>
        <p>Mr. Irvine's appearance at Saks during Fashion Week and on ''The Late Show With David Letterman'' the previous week are part of a promotional push by Jaguar, Formula One and some of its major sponsors into the only market that has eluded them: the United States. Auto racing has never been bigger in the United States, but Nascar and Indy-style ovals have eclipsed road racing.</p>
        <p>Strange. Formula One may be the most glamorous, extreme and richest sport around, and yet it is literally foreign to a nation that prizes all those things. These are the most technologically sophisticated race cars. Their screaming roar is the unforgettable sound of engines running at 19,000 revolutions per minute, that go from 0 to 125 miles an hour in less than seven seconds and decelerate so fast the carbon brakes glow red. In 200-mile-an-hour turns, drivers sustain a G-force almost as great as a fighter pilot's. A Village Voice article on the death of the great Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna in 1994 noted that Formula One cars generate enough downforce in theory to be driven upside-down across a ceiling.</p>
        <p>The drivers' heart rates can pound at more than 200 beats a minute; a driver can lose 10 pounds in a 90-minute race. And like bullfighters, drivers chance death every time they step in front of a crowd. Michael Schumacher of the Ferrari team, considered by many  the sport's best driver, was listed in March by Forbes magazine as the highest paid athlete in the world, at  $49 million a year.</p>
        <p>What more, a Formula One proselytizer might ask, do you want from a sport?</p>
        <p>To distinguish itself from Nascar's good-old-boy following, the current Formula One campaign in the United States has been very high end. Luxury brands are pushing the Grand Prix as the LMVH of motor racing, polo on wheels.</p>
        <p>Tag Heuer, the official timekeeper for Formula One, took out a six-page advertising spread in the September issue of Vanity Fair, juxtaposing images of its sports watches with the McLaren-Mercedes racing car. At this year's Oscars, Tag Heuer gave out 100 of its $1,700 Formula One 2000 Grand Prix Chronogaphs to performers and presenters. And this summer, Tag Heuer, Hugo Boss and Mercedes were the hosts of parties at the Guggenheim Museum and in Southhampton. The guest list aimed at the kind of young, rich, beautiful people who have always been moths to the Formula One flame in Europe. A McLaren show car was on display, so people could gawk and marvel at the surprising smallness and coolness of the fastest car on the circuit.</p>
        <p>Before today's race, Ferrari, the only serious competitor for McLaren, will run its usual exhibition race with amateur drivers wealthy enough to own Ferrari sports cars.</p>
        <p>By far the most aggressive campaign to raise Formula One awareness in this country has been Jaguar's, which is in its first year of competition. On the morning of the Saks party, Mr. Irvine drove a Formula One Jag down Broadway -- traffic had been cleared from 48th Street to 44th. A Formula One team can cost $200 million to $300 million a year to run. For Jaguar -- and its parent company, Ford -- the expense is part of a long-term plan to build a winning team. For the moment, it's a loss leader.</p>
        <p>''We are moving Jaguar toward a performance-oriented brand, trying to appeal to a slightly younger customer,'' said Simon Sproule, vice president of public affairs for Jaguar North America. ''There's no better platform than Formula One, with the caveat that the U.S. is the best market for our cars but the one that knows the least about Formula One.''</p>
        <p>The challenge for Jaguar, Mercedes and Honda, companies that use Formula One as a platform to promote their consumer lines, is to penetrate beyond ''the guys who are watching Speedvision at 3 a.m.,'' said Mr. Sproule. ''What we as a car manufacturer are concerned with is the nonpetrolheads.''</p>
        <p>Hence, Mr. Irvine's appearance on the Letterman show. David Letterman declined to be interviewed for this article, but he's the only late-night talk-show host who books Formula One drivers. David Cronenberg, the film director and a fellow racing fanatic, said Mr. Letterman once told him, ''I only care about two things: broadcasting and Formula One.''</p>
        <p>Between Mr. Irvine's Irish accent and offhand jokes about a sport most viewers haven't a clue about, he and his host seemed almost to be speaking in code. Mr. Irvine said his father was such a racing nut that he had almost named his son ''Moss Irvine.'' Mr. Letterman chuckled, getting a reference to the legendary British driver, Stirling Moss, that probably sailed clear over his millions of viewers.</p>
        <p>Cocky, charming and stylish in his black suits and bleached hair, Mr. Irvine is an America-friendly celebrity. As a rookie he once provoked Senna, at the time the champion, to take a swing at him. At Ferrari, he publicly complained that being the No. 2 driver to the exacting, teutonic Mr. Schumacher was like being hit every day on the head with a cricket bat. He seems like the kind of bad-boy toy Madonna might seek out to father a love-child.</p>
        <p>Sexy stars aside, there are still a few roadblocks to winning over the United States market. Aside from the Letterman show, mainstream media coverage has been minimal. And most fans of international sport are more likely to watch the Olympics right now, especially with a local hero to root for.</p>
        <p>Mario Andretti, who raced Formula One from 1968 to 1982, was the last American champion, but he was born in Trieste and never fully lost his Italian accent. Michael Andretti, Mario's son, competed in 1993, unsuccessfully. The last United States Grand Prix was held in Phoenix in the dead of summer.</p>
        <p>''Totally the wrong place,'' said Thomas L. Bryant, the editor in chief for Road &amp; Track. The Indy speedway ''is probably the best place to do it,'' he said. ''It's the mecca of automobile racing in America.''</p>
        <p>Roger Werner, the president of Speedvision, said his channel usually gets 150,000 to 300,000 viewers for a live Grand Prix telecast. Today's race, he said, could attract 400,000 to a million. ''It's never going to be as large an audience as Nascar,'' he said. But it is a desirable audience for advertisers because Formula One fans have higher income and education levels and ''tend to be skewed toward the major metropolitan markets -- its more cosmopolitan.''</p>
        <p>To the uninitiated, Formula One is not the most accessible of sports. Two teams, Ferrari and McLaren, are laps ahead of the pack technologically, and their drivers almost always win. (After 14 races, Mika Hakkinen of Finland, who drives a McLaren, leads Mr. Schumacher by 2 points in the drivers' standings.) Passing is too difficult, and too dangerous, and so the car that starts out in front, in the pole position, which is determined by time trials, and wins the drag race into the first turn, frequently finishes in the same position.</p>
        <p>Nascar drivers, like country music stars, spend hours signing autographs. Formula One drivers are hermetically sequestered from their fans. Entry to the Paddock Club, the equivalent of box seating, is restricted to corporate sponsors or the very rich. Admittance to the paddock itself, the sanctum sanctorum of the drivers and their teams, is akin to a papal audience.</p>
        <p>Even media access can be difficult. This restrictiveness is a deliberate strategy of Bernie Ecclestone, the man who runs Formula One racing, to enhance its exclusive aura. Mr. Ecclestone controls Formula One Management, which in June was granted all commercial rights to Formula One by the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (of which he is vice president) until the year 2110 for about $360 million. This is roughly his company's revenues in a single year. There were no other bidders, according a recent article in The Economist about Formula One's murky finances, which can make professional boxing, by comparison, look like a union shop. (The European Union is investigating whether racing concerns owned by Mr. Ecclestone broke competition laws.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Ecclestone has a reputation as an obscure and eccentric figure. In a telephone interview from London, he started whistling when asked about The Economist story, calling journalists ''fiction writers.''</p>
        <p>The assertion that he has monopolistic control over Formula One is ''probably true,'' he said, adding, ''What it amounts to in reality is that I've been able to do the things I want to do with the sport.'' But, he said, ''I'm not a criminal, no.''</p>
        <p>Sylvester Stallone alluded to Mr. Ecclestone's controlling influence as the reason he changed the hero of his next movie, ''Champs,'' from a Formula One driver to an Indy-style driver. ''There is a certain person in charge of that series who has his own agenda,'' Mr. Stallone said in February. ''Making an F1 movie has become impossible.'' Mr. Ecclestone offered no comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cronenberg, the film director, has written a script called ''Red Cars,'' about the American driver Phil Hill's championship season for Ferrari in 1961, but he can't find anyone to produce it. ''People seem to love to read it,'' he said on the phone from his home in Toronto. ''I've been asked to turn it into a novel.'' But not a movie.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cronenberg, who raced cars as an amateur, named Jeff Goldblum's scientist in ''The Fly'' after the British driver Martin Brundle.</p>
        <p>How does he rate the sport's chances of finding an audience in the United States? ''America likes extremes and Formula One is the most extreme sport there is,'' he said. ''The missing piece of the puzzle is a brilliant American driver.''</p>
        <p>Until then, Mr. Irvine offers another reason to watch today's race:</p>
        <p>''It's the thrill, isn't it?''</p>
