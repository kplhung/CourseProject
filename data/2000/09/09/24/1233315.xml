        <p>A $55 million renovation plan for the Brooklyn Museum of Art was unveiled this week, but a much more modest museum in another borough is looking forward to an ambitious face-lift of its own.</p>
        <p>The Bronx Museum of the Arts, which focuses on modern and contemporary work by international and local artists, plans to double and possibly triple its size during the next decade. Studies of the site are under way, and the museum hopes to choose an architect soon.</p>
        <p>The aim of the project, which was announced two weeks ago, is to renovate and expand the museum, which now has five galleries in 31,000 square feet of space. The first phase of improvements, expected to begin in June 2002, will involve renovating the existing building on 165th Street and the Grand Concourse to make the glass facade more inviting and to upgrade the interior.</p>
        <p>A second phase will involve erecting a new structure next door that would contain new gallery space, classrooms, a technology center and an auditorium. Other improvements would include an upgraded cafe and gift shop and better access for the disabled.</p>
        <p>The Bronx Museum, the borough's only major art institution, was founded in 1971 and originally camped out in the rotunda of the Bronx County Courthouse on 161st Street. In 1983, the museum found a permanent home in the former Young Israel Synagogue, which houses its permanent collection of about 1,000 pieces.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the museum has sought to promote the work of such artists as the sculptor Bryon Kim, the painter Glenn Ligon, the installation artist Tomie Arai, and Tim Rollins and K.O.S., Bronx artists whose specialty is public art.</p>
        <p>Currently, the museum uses one of its five gallery spaces as an auditorium because it has no lecture or performance hall. It has four studios for workshops, but each holds just a few dozen students.</p>
        <p>''Museums aren't just places where people go to view art anymore,'' said Eathon G. Hall Jr., the museum's curator of education. ''So you want to have a place where you can see art, learn about it, get involved in art-making activities and then have some entertainment built in.''</p>
