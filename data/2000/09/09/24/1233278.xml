        <p>Two dozen ''green monsters,'' nearly half of which have been occupying sidewalk space in a landmark neighborhood for nearly two years, will soon be removed, some possibly within a month. The boxes house electronic and fiber optic equipment for Time Warner Cable.</p>
        <p>''It takes a while to actually make the change,'' said Harriet Novet, a Time Warner spokeswoman. ''Remember, these are working technological facilities that are servicing people right now. But once they're moved, we're going to completely restore the sidewalk.''</p>
        <p>Time Warner began installing the boxes throughout the city two years ago as part of its new high-speed Internet access service called Road Runner. The boxes are about four feet square and sit on one-foot-high concrete pedestals. In Jackson Heights, they sit along 37th Avenue and surrounding streets.</p>
        <p>Because part of Jackson Heights is a landmark district, the installation of the boxes was supposed to be approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. But no request for landmarks approval was filed.</p>
        <p>Last October, Time Warner admitted it had acted improperly, and the company promised that the boxes would be moved to less visible places soon. In June, when none had been moved, a meeting was called at Borough Hall to resolve the issue.</p>
        <p>Time Warner says it has found less obtrusive places for the 10 boxes in the landmark district, and is seeking new sites for the 14 other boxes nearby.</p>
        <p>The moving of the ''green monsters,'' as critics call them, can't be too soon for Karl Christensen, president of the Jackson Heights Neighborhood Association. ''They're ugly, disgusting,'' he said. ''People put trash on top of them.''</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Saunders, president of the Jackson Heights Garden City Society, is just pleased that action is being taken. ''They're doing what they should have done in the beginning,'' he said.</p>
