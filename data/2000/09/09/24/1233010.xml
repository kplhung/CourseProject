        <p>THE MILE HIGH CLUB</p>
        <p>By Kinky Friedman.</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster, $23.</p>
        <p>You don't read a Kinky Friedman mystery for the plot. No, as with the work of Raymond Chandler, Walter Mosley and countless other practitioners of the genre, you read it for the attitude, the voice. Of course, in Friedman's case, that voice is less hard-boiled than smart-alecky and ribald, like a 1960's prankster turned millennial survivor -- which is a decription that suits its creator pretty well. An irreverent and frequently off-color country music singer (his best-known band was called the Texas Jewboys), Friedman writes with something of a similar spirit, casting himself as his own central character not so much to blur the line between fact and fiction as to have a little fun. His 13th novel, ''The Mile High Club,'' opens on a flight from Dallas to New York, where Friedman meets a beautiful woman, only to end up with her carry-on bag when she mysteriously disappears. From there, reality falls quickly down the rabbit hole as the luggage and its contents become the most sought after commodities in Manhattan, and the Kinkster (as he's affectionately known) must fend off everyone from a squad of Arab terrorists to the State Department. Like the author's previous novels, ''The Mile High Club'' begins to unravel if you look at it too closely; as a detective, for instance, Friedman is awfully passive, spending much of his time smoking cigars in his downtown Manhattan loft, waiting for the bad guys to come to him. Far more problematic, though, is that, this time out, even Friedman's wit seems two-dimensional, a string of one-liners that don't quite add up to anything, as if he (and we) have seen it all before.</p>
