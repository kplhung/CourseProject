        <p>PATRONS of the old Spaccarelli's, a shabby place in the A.&amp;P. shopping strip here, have probably seen its brand new structure just around the corner. The restaurant has been reinvented as a contemporary spot,  with gauzy curtains covering a sweep of glass on one wall and a honeycomb stacked with wine bottles on another. Subtle lighting and dusty rose walls make the room glow. Although still a neighborhood eatery, it's not the Spaccarelli's we remember, and hooray for that.</p>

        <p>PATRONS of the old Spaccarelli's, a shabby place in the A.&amp;P. shopping strip here, have probably seen its brand new structure just around the corner. The restaurant has been reinvented as a contemporary spot,  with gauzy curtains covering a sweep of glass on one wall and a honeycomb stacked with wine bottles on another. Subtle lighting and dusty rose walls make the room glow. Although still a neighborhood eatery, it's not the Spaccarelli's we remember, and hooray for that.</p>
        <p>Fans have been delighted to follow the restaurant to its new digs. Patrons are greeted not only by name but often also with questions about family or a recent vacation.</p>
        <p>We wish the kitchen were as consistent as the service and decor. In general, however, pasta was properly cooked and sauces nicely turned out. The menu pairs sauces with particular pastas, but the kitchen seemed willing to match almost any pasta with any sauce. For example, a blackboard special listed rigatoni with broccoli rape; we asked for gnocchi instead, and the result was a rave. Silky, smooth gnocchi, cut on the bias and made, it seemed, within the last 10 minutes, came mingled with the delicious vegetable, the sweetness of fresh garlic countering the tangy broccoli. A special of cavatelli was also treated to broccoli rape, this time with roasted garlic and thick slices of juicy sausage.</p>
        <p>Perhaps in a backlash to designer sauces, good old bolognese seems to be making a comeback. Here it was thick, meaty and needing only the acidic complexity more tomato would have imparted. Because the stout, satisfying noodle requires careful cooking, perciatelli appears on few menus. It is offered here, however, and went splendidly with bolognese sauce.</p>
        <p>Spiked with bits of prosciutto, rich, warming tortellini alla nonna -- a perfect choice for cool evenings -- brought the fat little pasta rings with peas and artichoke heart in cream-pinked tomato sauce. And simple penne alla vodka was all it should be.</p>
        <p>Clams posillipo need only two things for success: tender (not rubbery) clams and light, naturally briny (not overly salted), garlicky tomato sauce. Spaccarelli's passed the test on both counts. The dish made a good opener. Or have the mixed house salad. Greller salad was basically the house salad topped with a dice of Gorgonzola, which had little flavor.</p>
        <p>Two entree specials were excellent. Served in so few restaurants these days, tripe Napolitana bore the perfume of aromatic vegetables, which added sweetness to the luscious sauce -- a must for diners longing for this dish. Osso buco, less a rarity, proved meltingly delicious.</p>
        <p>Other entrees were less engaging. But for minor additions, chicken scarpariello and three tiny overcooked quail were treated to the same basic brown sauce. Meat and sauce lacked integration, the sauces seemingly added to the birds just before they were served. Shrimp proved tough and flavorless, except for salt, the dominant flavor in the styles scampi and oreganato. Unless especially noted, most entrees lacked a green vegetable, leaving some plates looking pallid.</p>
        <p>Crumbly yet moist, almond-flavored ricotta cheesecake was an ideal to which other ricotta cheesecakes only aspire. Creamy tiramisu held no surprises, but dry apples made apple tart unacceptable. Strawberries were unripe, and other baked desserts on the cart looked sleekly commercial.</p>
        <p>A three-course dinner averages $30 without drinks, tax and tip. Spaccarelli's is on Route 100 north of Route 133.</p>
