        <p>THE quiet residential town of Trumbull, founded in 1797, arguably tops the list of battle-scarred Connecticut municipalities that have lost legal skirmishes  with developers of luxury housing who attempt to increase the allowable size of their projects by including lower-income apartments.

        <p>THE quiet residential town of Trumbull, founded in 1797, arguably tops the list of battle-scarred Connecticut municipalities that have lost legal skirmishes  with developers of luxury housing who attempt to increase the allowable size of their projects by including lower-income apartments. These projects use a Connecticut law permitting higher density in exchange for offering some units at lower cost to people with lower incomes.</p>
        <p>Developers whose projects were denied by Trumbull and other communities around the state have taken the towns to court under the Connecticut Affordable Housing Appeals Law of 1989, winning the right to build market-rate housing at negotiable densities that are greater than allowed by existing zoning regulations. In return, the developer sets aside a percentage of the units at below-market rates for qualified buyers or renters.</p>
        <p>Almost invariably, the towns were not able to mount effective defenses, which the law limited to proof that such projects should be rejected as detrimental to the community or that the town's interests outweighed the need for moderate-income housing or that the project could not be altered to meet the town's interests.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 1, a new amendment to the law becomes effective allowing towns that have added 2 percent to their moderate-income housing stock since 1990 to declare three-year moratoriums on construction of moderate-income housing. (After each 2 percent increase, a town may declare additional moratoriums until it reaches the state's goal of 10 percent of a town's dwellings, when it is exempt from the law.) Despite Trumbull's history of resistance, it has complied with court orders to build enough low-cost units to qualify for relief by declaring a three-year moratorium on such housing.</p>
        <p>The term affordable applies to housing that costs up to 30 percent of the tenant's or owner's income, which cannot exceed 80 percent of the area or state median, whichever is lower. The state's median income is $66,000. In the Trumbull-Bridgeport area it is $67,700 and in the Stamford-Greenwich-Norwalk area it rises to $102,400.</p>
        <p>Only 32 of Connecticut's 169 towns and cities have moderate-income housing of 10 percent or more. Trumbull, in eastern Fairfield County, had been one of the remaining 137 towns with little or no such housing. But during more than eight years of litigation with various developers it acquired under court orders one apartment complex and four single-family developments with a total of 312 affordable units. With 11,500 dwellings in town, 1,150 units would make up the  target of 10 percent, and 312 brings it past the 2 percent level.</p>
        <p>Over the years growing dissatisfaction with the law prompted the formation more than a year ago of Gov. John G. Rowland's Commission to Study Affordable Housing. Recommendations promulgated by the commission in February are being put into regulations by the Department of Economic and Community Development. They then must be ratified by the Legislature.</p>
        <p>In addition to the moratoriums, the amendment contains features that may appease some opponents of the law by serving to curb development, but developers and advocates of moderate-income housing are concerned that production of such units will be curtailed when the need is high and the cost of market-rate housing is at a peak.</p>
        <p>A report earlier this year by the Connecticut office of Fannie Mae, the nation's largest provider of mortgage funds, says that 68,000 new units are needed to meet current demand in the state and that 48,000 households pay half or more of their income for housing.</p>
        <p>The amendment is expected to increase the number of affordable units in a development from the current 25 percent level to 30 percent. The income ceiling for half of those units would be 60 percent of the area or state median, while the rest would stay at the 80 percent ceiling. Income limits would remain in effect for 40 years, up from 30.</p>
        <p>Some who are familiar with the efforts to deliver more affordable housing have expressed concern about some changes being brought about by the amendment. ''With the increase to 30 percent of units and 40 years' duration,'' said Timothy Hollister, a Hartford lawyer who specializes in affordable housing law, ''you are decreasing the amount of rent and reducing the amount realized from sales. In Fairfield County, with land prices going up, that is not likely to produce more affordable housing.''</p>
        <p>''Changes in the statute,'' said Mark Forlenza, vice president for development for the Connecticut-New York region in the Wilton office of AvalonBay Communities of Alexandria, Va., one of the most active developers in the New York City suburbs,  ''were definitely directed at the larger developer. They just make it harder to create an economically viable project. Originally, the affordable housing law was put in place to get around exclusionary zoning. The more they fool with it, the less affordable housing will be provided in Connecticut.''</p>
        <p>UNDER the Connecticut regulations, Mr. Forlenza said, ''In some of the more affluent communities we would not even be able to build all market-rate housing because of zoning that restricts rental housing.''</p>
        <p>Resistance to the affordable housing law has been strongest in affluent suburban towns, where it is seen as an assault on the traditional independence of Connecticut's local planning and zoning commissions. Last year the law suffered its first substantial setback when state courts upheld the positions of Glastonbury, Newtown and Bridgewater against developers. The three towns had successfully argued that applications they had received for moderate-income housing under the law should be denied for reasons involving potable water, septic tanks and open space.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the law charge that it has not been having the effect it was designed to bring about. ''Developers have been coming in and zone-busting areas for windfall profits,'' said Kenneth S. Halaby, Trumbull's first selectman. ''My own daughter makes $40,000 a year and couldn't afford an 'affordable' apartment here,'' he said, adding that Trumbull's teachers, firefighters and police could not afford to live in the town. ''It isn't that the people don't want affordable housing,'' Mr. Halaby said. ''They object to a well-intentioned but flawed state mandate.''</p>
        <p>Martin Shapiro, a Trumbull resident who has opposed the law from the start, said the flaws mainly involved density and unaffordability. ''There are no affordables at Avalon Springs,'' he said, referring to the 340-unit AvalonBay apartment complex, where market-rate rents for 180 units are $1,100 to $1,900 and rents for the 68 reduced-rate units are $800 to $1,050 plus utilities. It is one of 19 similar projects built in the state by AvalonBay and described as ''beautiful'' by Mr. Shapiro.</p>
        <p>But, he said, ''it's a shame for the state to force the suburbs into high density.'' Under a 1992 court order, the town was obliged to accept the 340 units or comply with AvalonBay's original plan for 600 units.</p>
        <p>Mr. Halaby's solution is ''to discourage for-profit developers by doing it ourselves.'' He ended six years of litigation over a 66-unit project proposed by the nonprofit Mutual Housing Association of Stamford by striking a deal with it for two affordable housing developments. ''Doing it nonprofit,'' Mr. Halaby said, ''fills the need with units that are less expensive than any for-profit developer can build and they are 100 percent affordable.''</p>
        <p>According to Larry Kluetsch, executive director of the Mutual Housing Association, the project was negotiated down from 66 to 43 town houses in seven two-story buildings and it will break ground in March on a six-acre site. Completion is scheduled for the end of 2001 at prices ranging from $105,000 for one-bedroom, one-bath units to $150,000 for three bedrooms and two baths. Garages, patios, landscaping, the standard number of kitchen appliances and a community clubhouse are included. Buyers will get their own mortgages and form an association to maintain landscaping and common areas.</p>
        <p>With strong town support for the project, Mutual Housing has obtained site acquisition and construction financing from People's Bank, and an application for subsidies is pending at the state's Department of Economic and Community Development. The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a nonprofit organization chartered by Congress in 1978 to assist other nonprofit groups on housing projects, will be a joint-venture partner with Mutual Housing.</p>
        <p>The second project, to be undertaken at an undetermined date, is to be a 25-unit complex for older adults on a 3.4-acre site given to the town by the state.</p>
        <p>Mutual Housing has created 117 units of low-cost housing in Stamford and 76 units in Bridgeport since 1990. Median rents for the group's homes in both towns are $600 to $700 a month. Mr. Kluetsch believes that the Trumbull development will be a model. ''Planned development with the town as an active partner,'' he said, ''gives the town more control and can create 100-percent affordable units, moving toward more affordables and a moratorium.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hollister, who represented Mutual Housing for six years in its bid to build in Trumbull, said: ''For-profit developers are not going to follow that model, and nonprofits can't follow anything else. It may not be a breakthrough, but it's a good result for everyone concerned.''</p>
