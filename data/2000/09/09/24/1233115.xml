        <p>THE Sleep-Tite Pajama Factory is all aflutter. Besides union trouble (workers want a seven-and-a-half cent raise), there are a few romances brewing.</p>
        <p>And so goes the plot for ''Pajama Game,'' the latest musical presented by the Cultural Arts Playhouse in Old Bethpage. And, as with other regional theaters, the preparation can be even more dramatic than the production itself.</p>
        <p>The classic 1950's musical features a plot involving the rise of labor unions, a brewing love affair, a hummable score (''I'm Not at All in Love,'' ''Steam Heat,'' ''Hernando's Hideaway'' and ''Hey There'') and a few perky dance numbers.</p>
        <p>While the Sept. 9 premiere might have run like clockwork, it took weeks of intense preparation to get there. And to add extra tumult, the director, Denise Greene, underwent vocal cord surgery four days before opening night.</p>
        <p>It was much different several months earlier when the play was selected (through a subscriber survey). The production crew was chosen and auditions began. The production manager, Brian Barteld, who works at the playhouse full time along with Ms. Greene, began sifting through his mother's garage for 1950's memorabilia. Besides overseeing the production, he coordinates the sound, lighting, stage managers, ushers and concessions. He was in charge of assembling five sets and collecting props.</p>
        <p>Next job: hire the actors. Since it was summer, auditions were light, and the male lead part was not filled. Ms. Greene approached the playhouse's owner, Bruce Grossman, and he volunteered for the lead role of Sid. Since most of the other lead characters were performing in ''Hair,'' another playhouse production, Ms. Greene said, scheduling was ''a major headache.''</p>
        <p>Because of the various productions and classes held at the 265-seat theater, the cast met in small groups at a local Y. They had to learn the blocking in the theater lobby.</p>
        <p>A week before opening night, much still needed to be done, from shooting publicity photos to run-throughs on the set of ''You're a Good Man Charlie Brown.''</p>
        <p>The first scene, to an outsider, seems to run perfectly. There's lots of on-stage action -- ensemble members pushing brooms, carrying make-believe packages and sewing at invisible sewing machines. Ms. Greene, who calls this a ''rush-through,'' moves actors around, diplomatically explaining that they are blocking the view of the star.</p>
        <p>Barbara Kirby, the costume designer, walks among the actors who are not on stage, selecting some for fittings. One of the few costume designers on Long Island, with 30 years of experience, she works for numerous local playhouses. She has already done her ''Pajama Game'' research, reading about 50's apparel, watching videotapes and gleaning descriptions from the script. She had already visited thrift shops, and checked in with her designer friends for specific items. It won't be unusual, she said, if she's altering costumes as the actors walk on stage opening night.</p>
        <p>''There's rarely a minute to breath,'' said Ms. Kirby, a former math teacher. ''But it's not boring.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Greene confers with everyone. The music director. The person who will open the curtains. The sound and lighting technicians. The actors. The pace is picking up. Mr. Grossman flubs his line. He curses at the music director. ''We're under a lot of pressure,'' an anonymous voice stage whispers from the back of the dark theater.</p>
        <p>As the ensemble performs ''Racing With  the Clock,'' Ms. Greene sits, stopwatch in hand. Dawn Slawitsky and Jen Buonomo, the choreographers, take notes.</p>
        <p>Most of the show's cast began in community theater, and hope to move on from regional theater to off-Broadway, Broadway and eventually television and film.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Kane, 23, of Bethpage is one of those hopefuls. She is the embodiment of one of the play's most famous lyrics: ''Hey there, you with the stars in your eyes.'' She plays Babe, the union's grievance committee representative. Written at a time when a character named Babe could be played by Doris Day (she starred in the film version), the musical brims with naivete. During rehearsal, Ms. Greene directed Ms. Kane to hold back on ''playing it sexy.''</p>
        <p>Like the other cast members (none of whom get paid), Ms. Kane, a former voice major, is focused on moving up the professional ladder. ''I love the atmosphere here,'' she said. ''We're like a family. There's never a sense of jealousy or competition. You don't want to leave.'' But she will.</p>
        <p>One standout is Brenda Festo, 20, of Commack. She has star potential, and hopes to use it to get to Broadway to play character parts like her ''Pajama Game'' role of Mabel. A day-care worker, she practices when she can, especially in her car.</p>
        <p>''People stare at me while I drive on Northern Parkway, and I'm reciting lines out loud,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Leslie Pellegrino, a union medical representative, plays Gladys, secretary to the Sleep-Tite president. She's nervous because though she has been performing since she was 6, this is her first dancing role, with one of the show's biggest dance numbers.</p>
        <p>Another character role, Hines, the time-management consultant, is played by Fred Tubello, a 44-year-old business consultant from Deer Park.</p>
        <p>''I just fell into acting,'' he said. His main concern is singing out loud on the train while listening to the score on headphones.</p>
        <p>Joe Danbusky, 24, of New Hyde Park plays Prez, the union head. Serious about acting as a career, he hopes to attend more Manhattan auditions. Meanwhile, he sits at lunch at work (as a member representative for the American Automobile Association), as his co-workers run through lines with him.</p>
        <p>Some cast members are happy to be in the background. Gerard Weber, 62 a former college history professor, plays Pops, a small role. ''Where else can a tone-deaf guy like me get to sing on stage?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lisa Meckes, a 45-year-old mother, is in the ensemble. She got the bug when her daughter took acting classes. They performed in several plays together, but this is Ms. Meckes's first on her own.</p>
        <p>As opening night approached, rehearsals became more frantic. Ms. Kane admitted: ''I'm not able to sleep, the nightmares have started. It's a very tense time. ''But when you get on stage, it's indescribable. Amazing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Green said: ''It's always nerve-racking. But when that adrenaline kicks in on opening night, there's nothing like it.''</p>
        <p>''Pajama Game'' runs through Oct. 14 at the Cultural Arts Playhouse, 712 Old Bethpage Road, Old Bethpage, (516) 694-3330.</p>
