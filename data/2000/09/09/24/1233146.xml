        <p>John Henry letter on Daisann McLane's September 3 notes Amtrak now has one train daily that carries bicycles to Providence, Rhode Island (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Daisann McLane's fine story omitted one detail that could save bicycle-owning travelers money if they take Amtrak to Providence as she did. There is now one train a day that carries bicycles to that city. It's the Twilight Shoreliner, which runs between Newport News, Va., and Boston.</p>
        <p>There's a $5 service charge for taking a bike on the train, and if passengers don't have boxes, they must buy them from Amtrak for $7 each. Passengers should have the tools needed for turning the handlebars on the bike and for removing the pedals so that they fit into the boxes.</p>

        <p>To be sure, the train's schedule is inconvenient: the northbound train leaves New York at 1 a.m. and arrives in Providence at 6 a.m.; the southbound train leaves Providence at 9:03 p.m. and arrives in New York at 1:14 a.m. But passengers can send their bikes ahead on the Twilight Shoreliner and take a train at a more reasonable hour. (They can collect them at the baggage counter at their destination.)</p>
        <p>The saving to be gained by taking one's own bike is not to be dismissed. The maximum outlay for transporting a bike on Amtrak would be $24 round trip, less than half what Ms. McLane spent to rent one in Rhode Island.</p>
