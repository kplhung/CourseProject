        <p>IN 1629 Rembrandt was 23. He had tousled, curly hair, a bulbous nose, a small mouth and round, staring eyes. He shared a studio in his birthplace, Leiden, with Jan Lievens. Two years later, having achieved fame and some fortune, to a large extent from experimenting with images of his own face, he moved to Amsterdam, the commercial and artistic center of the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Many self-portraits of the artist appear in ''Rembrandt Creates Rembrandt: Art and Ambition in Leiden, 1629-1631,'' opening today and running through Jan. 7 at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum here. The exhibition examines how Rembrandt managed his career during those critical years.</p>
        <p>Once again, a little show at the Gardner addresses large themes. The museum's exhibition gallery, painted a warm gray, is hung with 9 etchings and 11 paintings, including 2 by Lievens and 2 with tentative attributions. The show, conceived by the Gardner's former curator of collections, Hilliard Goldfarb, and organized by its current curator, Alan Chong, touches on the major issues of Rembrandt scholarship: attribution, the evolution of his experimental techniques and his historical, critical and cultural context.</p>
        <p>It also asks a broader question: what values, what lessons, do we take from his art today? The exhibition and its scholarly catalog reveal as much about contemporary attitudes toward art and artists as they do about Rembrandt.</p>
        <p>At first glance it would seem difficult for such intimate works to carry heavy arguments. (The largest, barely 35 inches high, is a 1629 self-portrait from the Gardner's own collection.) But these are the images Rembrandt used to make his reputation and to proclaim his presence in Leiden and beyond.</p>
        <p>Each is arresting, each is suggestive and each conveys the sense of a man fulfilling his powers and ambition. Rembrandt was learning how to give emotional impact to shadows, attitudes, even architecture. In the 1630 etching ''Christ Disputing With the Doctors,'' he stages the drama on a theatrical platform set off by curved steps. Joseph and Mary watch as their young boy holds his own in a discussion of the law with wise men in the temples. An outsize column emphasizes the sense of upset proportion as the grand doctors, arranged in an arc, consult their books incredulously or bend to listen to the boy, his face glowing, his back in foreboding shadow. Looking on from the wings on the right, the featureless figures of Mary and Joseph are stand-ins for Rembrandt's Protestant audience.</p>
        <p>Rembrandt also used etchings to practice portraiture. When he was starting out, he lacked lucrative portrait commissions, so he found anonymous models, old men and women, and he used himself, experimenting with expression, with character, casting himself in different roles. For centuries critics have compared him with Shakespeare for his ability to conjure the gamut of human experience. Rembrandt portrayed himself in a beggar's cloak with his toes protruding from broken shoes, then in a dignified cape and velvet hat; he presented himself laughing, raging, dejected.</p>
        <p>There is a ruthlessness to these images; Rembrandt refused to make himself attractive, to dilute with beauty his exploration of anger, or weariness, or pride. He also did not contradict the attractive myth, already in circulation, of his youthful poverty. (He was, indeed, a miller's son, but his father was well off and well connected, able to send his youngest boy to Latin school and enroll him in the University of Leiden.)</p>
        <p>In a portrait by Lievens, however, Rembrandt appears handsome; his nose is not quite so protuberant; his eyes gaze less fiercely from under his arched brows. Lievens paints his lips full and young; Rembrandt always gives himself the thin, hardened mouth of an older man. Constantijn Huygens, a contemporary connoisseur, visited the two young artists and recorded astute impressions: ''It is as if you were looking at old men of many years, who were already tired of frivolous diversions.''</p>
        <p>If Lievens's portrait, for all its refinement, lacks a level of intensity, that painting, along with his ''Head of an Old Woman (Rembrandt's Mother),'' demonstrates that Rembrandt worked beside a master of surface elegance, an artist whose paintings collectors confused with Rembrandt's as early as 1633. But as Huygens observed, ''Rembrandt is superior to Lievens with regard to judgment and in the power to affect feelings.''</p>
        <p>REMBRANDT painted ''Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem'' in 1630. The city is burning; Rembrandt brushed smoke in thin, wild strokes over a dark ground; against this violent holocaust the prophet rests in a disorienting diagonal. His right arm is hidden (a reference to Psalm 137, ''If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand lose its cunning). Flames illuminate his aged face in a web of brush strokes catching exhaustion and despair.</p>
        <p>Did Rembrandt choose his subjects and the small scale of these works from a canny sense of what the market would bear -- his self-portrait etchings found eager buyers -- or from an inner need? Ambition, in our skeptical and materialistic age, is a worldly quality. We view artists very much in market terms: we ask how they positioned themselves for success, how they figured out and delivered what the public would buy. Yet ambition can also be private, and that is the true subject of this show.</p>
        <p>''Rembrandt Creates Rembrandt'' arrives in armor. Like the artist's ''Man in Military Costume,'' the show's carapace is a formidable and informative catalog. But the works themselves are hung without labels; a free descriptive brochure provides identification and brief commentary. ''We wanted people to look,'' Mr. Chong said. ''To see these images unencumbered, and to think about the existence of genius.''</p>
        <p>In 1629, Rembrandt painted ''Artist in his Studio.'' The easel, seen from the back, takes up most of the shabby room and dominates the panel, which is only slightly bigger than a sheet of typing paper. The artist stands in the background, a tiny figure overdressed for work in a big hat and heavy robe with cumbersome sleeves.</p>
        <p>Holding his brushes, he stares -- round, dark eyes under arched brows -- in an expression of profound and utter surprise. Is he staring at us, at himself, at what he has created? His gaze -- his astonishment -- encompasses all the world.</p>
