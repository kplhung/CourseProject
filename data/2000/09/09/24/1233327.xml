        <p>ON a stormy evening last May, silvery voices could be heard floating down the halls of Public School 321 in Park Slope.</p>
        <p>''To-may-to! To-mah-to! Po-tay-to! Po-tah-to! ''Let's call the whole thing off . . . ''</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>ON a stormy evening last May, silvery voices could be heard floating down the halls of Public School 321 in Park Slope.</p>
        <p>''To-may-to! To-mah-to! Po-tay-to! Po-tah-to! ''Let's call the whole thing off . . . ''</p>
        <p>As the children sang, their parents drank coffee and ate Pepperidge Farm cookies in the auditorium.  Standing among them, a youthful-looking man in a dark suit, suspenders and wire-rimmed glasses eagerly shook hands. As parents drifted over, he passed around photographs of his new baby daughter, Shaina Isabel.</p>
        <p>Mark G. Peters, 35, was upbeat that night, but he was also anxious. The combined P.T.A. meeting-choral performance was starting late, and he still had to speak at another parent meeting in Cobble Hill. As president of the District 15 school board, which covers a large chunk of brownstone Brooklyn, he had a message to deliver, and, these being the year's final P.T.A. meetings, he had to get it out tonight.</p>
        <p>A woman rushed up to him.</p>
        <p>''My daughter got a 675 on the E.L.A.!'' she announced, referring to the English Language Assessment test given at the end of elementary school. The score was just high enough to permit early admission to Middle School 51, one of the district's best. ''She got into her first-choice school!'' the mother said.</p>
        <p>''Great!'' Mr. Peters responded, spotting an opening. ''And in a couple of years, John Jay will be ready for her.''</p>
        <p>The woman hesitated.</p>
        <p>''Well,'' she said, ''we have three years to worry about that.''</p>
        <p>The meeting started, and Mr. Peters stepped up to the podium to describe to that woman and 60 other parents the renaissance he hoped would take place at John Jay High School and the changes he hoped would persuade local parents to send their children there.</p>
        <p>John Jay, a stately, century-old red-brick structure, takes up a full block of Seventh Avenue between Third and Fourth Streets in Park Slope. It is surrounded by signs of gentrification: restaurants like Sotto Voce across the street, a Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore a block away. Every weekday afternoon, hundreds of students pour out of the school's front doors and into the neighborhood. But they do not hang around.</p>
        <p>''Come on, ladies and gentlemen, you've got to move!'' yells one of the security guards, herding them off. ''Go on! Go somewhere! Get out of here!''</p>
        <p>The scene is not untypical near city high schools. Still, a longtime resident strolling down the other side of the street looked up at the sight.</p>
        <p>''I've never actually been inside of the school,'' she said. ''Are there bars on all the windows?''</p>
        <p>The answer to that is no. But if Mr. Peters had been there, he would have hurried over to address her concerns. He contends that along with quality of teachers and breadth of curriculum, a critical component in a school is people's beliefs about it.</p>
        <p>''If there are a bunch of negative perceptions about a school,'' Mr. Peters said, ''even if they are untrue or exaggerated, you are not going to get parents to invest in it or send their kids there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Peters grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, graduated from Horace Mann High School, Brown University and University of Michigan Law School. He is deputy chief for civil rights for the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer. He moved to Park Slope 10 years ago, but it was not until 1996, when he was elected to District 15's school board -- he became  president last year -- that he became aware of an  anomaly. The district's 38 elementary and middle schools, which ranked a presentable 11th among the city's 33 districts, were attended largely by local students. But with high school, everything changed.</p>
        <p>''Very few of our middle schoolers were going to John Jay,'' Mr. Peters said. To keep the academic and safety standards they had been accustomed to, he said, they felt forced to leave the district to go to high school. ''That we lavished all this time and care on our kids in elementary school,'' he added, ''and then they didn't have anywhere to go locally, was a real problem.''</p>
        <p>John Jay is the main high school earmarked for students from District 15, which includes Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Boerum Hill, Red Hook, Sunset Park, Windsor Terrace and Kensington. Its larger catchment zone includes parts of other neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>According to a recent District 15 report, only 220 of the district's 1,346 eighth graders enrolled in John Jay last year. School records show that only a fourth of John Jay's total student body comes from the district, with 43 percent from outside the catchment zone. Some of the latter group were accepted to John Jay's well-regarded Law and Justice program. Others were displaced when their high schools closed. Still others were suspended from their own schools and redirected to John Jay.</p>
        <p>Some parents and administrators say this arrangement has transformed John Jay into a dumping ground. Early in the 20th century the school served local children and, back when it was called Manual Training High School, it produced eminent graduates, including a future Nobel physicist, Isadore Rabi, and the actresses Peggy Wood and Thelma Ritter. But these days, the numbers tell a dismal story.</p>
        <p>The school's test scores and the rates of attendance and graduation are below the city average. The number of suspensions and brushes with the law are higher. Few students stay for four years. Last year, the freshman class had 1,278 students, the 12th grade 332.</p>
        <p>Improvements Made,  But Mixed Feelings Remain</p>
        <p>LAST year, some improvements were made under a new principal. But many parents still have mixed feelings. When Annette Hendrickson of Sunset Park learned that her son didn't get his first two choices last year and had been assigned to John Jay, she marched into the guidance counselor's office.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'He's not going to John Jay,' '' Ms. Hendrickson recalled. As an aide at P.S. 172, her neighborhood elementary school, she had heard horror stories.</p>
        <p>''One of the security guards at P.S. 172 got transferred to John Jay,'' she said. ''The first day she goes in, she gets slashed with a knife. And I've got a friend, her ninth grader went there and got asked for money. He didn't have any, and they pulled a knife on him.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hendrickson's son was eventually reassigned. But the problem persisted, along with a wistful understanding of the school's local potential.</p>
        <p>''Every year when it came time for people to select a high school, I would hear these little mutterings about, 'Isn't it too bad they can't go to John Jay?' '' said Marge Raphaelson, a P.S. 321 parent and a member of the P.T.A.'s executive board. Lately, she said, the grumbling has gotten louder. ''Now it's, 'Well, why can't they go in their district? Why is this process so horrible?' ''</p>
        <p>With Mr. Peters's plan, it doesn't have to be. The plan, which needs the approval of the Board of Education and the local school board and would go into effect next fall, would transform John Jay from a four-year high school with up to 3,000 students into a 6th-to-12th-grade school with 2,000 students. Two District 15 middle schools, the Manuel De Dios Unanue Journalism Academy in Red Hook and the New School for Research in the Natural and Social Sciences in Kensington, would move into the building, so their students could grow up in small-sized high school institutes, a formula that has been successful in other high school turnarounds. John Jay's Law and Justice program would expand down into the middle school grades, creating a third institute.  Current John Jay students would finish their studies there, but eventually the school would restrict the flow of new students from outside the catchment zone.</p>
        <p>Parents Worry:  Would the Students Be Safe?</p>
        <p>AS Mr. Peters explained this plan, hands went up. Most were from parents who wondered whether their children would be safe in a population of older and supposedly rougher students.</p>
        <p>''Let's not joke about it,'' Mr. Peters said. ''If parents don't feel safe in the building, this is not going to be a go.'' To alleviate fears, he said, middle and high schoolers might be housed in separate areas. They  might also have different starting and dismissal times.</p>
        <p>''Nothing is written in stone,'' he said. ''At this point they aren't even written in wet cement. But if this all works out, by September 2001 we will have a world-class high school, a local high school that we can all send our children to.''</p>
        <p>One day not long ago, sitting in a Park Slope cafe, his daughter asleep in her stroller beside him, Mr. Peters scribbled details of the plan on a pad of lined paper. He talks quickly, as if to get out all his ideas before anyone can object.</p>
        <p>''We can design the greatest program in the world,'' he said. ''But if kids don't go there, it's not going to work. We've got to get a community that's fearful of John Jay into John Jay.''</p>
        <p>And many District 15 parents view John Jay as dangerous and academically weak. Some John Jay students and teachers fear they will be pushed aside under a reorganization. (The displacement issue also involves race: reorganization would bring in a broader mix, including more white students.) There is also a fear  the revamped school could become a ''Park Slope phenomenon'' that ignores  needs of children elsewhere in the district.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peters said the fears of a ''Park Slope phenomenon'' should be quelled by the fact that the incoming middle schools will bring in students from other areas. The Journalism Academy, for example, will create a ''natural funnel'' for students from Sunset Park, he said.</p>
        <p>Waking in her stroller, Shaina started to fuss. Her father picked her up and jostled her. ''This will be your school someday, sweetheart,'' he cooed.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Peters will not be one of the parents whose child is a John Jay pioneer. And not every District 15 parent is thrilled about the plan.</p>
        <p>''There is no way in hell I would send my daughter to John Jay during the transition period,'' said Fran Levy, a Kensington mother who attended the meeting at P.S. 321. Of Mr. Peters's suggestion that incoming middle school students could be separated from outgoing high school students, she said: ''If you think that's going to protect them, that's ridiculous. It's class warfare being presented as educational improvement.''</p>
        <p>But, said Alyson Vogel, a Park Slope mother of two, ''I would love to see children from this community walking together to school.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Raphaelson, a member of the committee that drafted the plan, added: ''We feel our children are in a way being displaced by not being able to use John Jay as their high school. John Jay has to be reinvented for District 15.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the perception that District 15 was trying to wrest the high school from the Board of Education caused a political flap that threatened to jeopardize the entire plan. Throughout most of the city, local districts oversee elementary and middle schools while the Board of Education oversees high schools.</p>
        <p>In December, an article in The New York Times and local newspapers said Mr. Peters had said the district hoped to take control of John Jay. The statement infuriated officials at the United Federation of Teachers and at Basis, the group that administers high schools in Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''We got ahead of ourselves,'' Mr. Peters admitted. ''They should have found out about this through me picking up a phone and telling them about it, long before it went public. They won't buy into it if you say, 'Hi, here's our plan for John Jay, start doing this,' nor should they. We had to think of a way to involve them.''</p>
        <p>So, he and Francis DeStefano, the district superintendent, turned to coalition-building. It helped that both David Sherman, vice president of the United Federation of Teachers, and Rose Albanese-DePinto, the Basis superintendent, had had experience with school turnarounds. And Ms. DePinto had another impetus.</p>
        <p>''I'm a graduate of John Jay High School,'' she said. ''No one could feel closer to John Jay High School than I do.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, with Mr. Sherman and the U.F.T. president, Randi Weingarten, moderating, it was decided that the school would be run by both Basis and the district. Mr. Peters says he now considers this collaboration one of the proposal's strongest selling points. In the past, he said, when other groups had tried to turn John Jay around, they had failed because they did not have credibility among educators or lacked a strong connection to the community. This group would have both.</p>
        <p>Committed to the Plan,  But Careful to Share the Credit</p>
        <p>PARENTS tend to describe Mr. Peters as the ''passionate,'' ''committed'' and ''devoted'' force behind the plan. But he is careful to share the credit.</p>
        <p>''If this all works, and I think it will,'' he said, ''David Sherman is a hero. There are huge pieces of this that nobody but David could have pulled off.'' And, he said, Ms. DePinto was instrumental in getting the support of teachers and administrators.</p>
        <p>''Now, if any of us falls away, you're driving a wagon missing a wheel.''</p>
        <p>They haven't smoothed out all the kinks. Some teachers are worried about the impact of an influx of middle school teachers and a decrease in students, even though Ms. Weingarten has said no teachers will lose jobs. ''Because there's no definitive plan right now,'' said Harold Lipitz, principal of John Jay, ''they're nervous, and rightfully so.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, coalition members are working to overcome negative perceptions.</p>
        <p>''It's a wonderful old building with a forensic science lab and supposedly a great swimming pool,'' Ms. Raphaelson said. ''The next time Marty Markowitz holds a public meeting,'' she suggested, referring to the state senator from the area, ''he should do it at John Jay,'' in its newly refurbished auditorium.</p>
        <p>Since the arrival of Mr. Lipitz as principal a year ago, changes are already taking place. The school hired 15 new teachers (bringing the total to 147), installed a greenhouse and garden, and initiated new after-school clubs. Students say discipline and academic standards have improved since Mr. Lipitz arrived.</p>
        <p>''Certain people around here feel that all the students in there are bad,'' said Anneza Ollivierre, a sophomore. ''If there were some way to help them realize that we are a good school, we are good kids, we want to achieve something. We just need a little help.''</p>
        <p>So will Ms. Raphaelson send her seventh grader, a student at the Research Academy, to a new John Jay?</p>
        <p>''If his program moves intact, with the directors and teachers that he's had, I have no problem moving him there,'' she said. But, she added, ''I would have to be assured that he would be safe, because I too have heard the rumors of lots of incidents in the school.'' If the plan goes through, she said, ''At that point I'll have to make a decision whether to put my son where my mouth is.''</p>
        <p>Even Ms. Hendrickson, who refused to let her oldest son to go to John Jay, said she was optimistic about what the school could offer her two younger children.</p>
        <p>''There's really no high school for us,'' she said. ''The parents want it bad.''</p>
        <p>And so, on a breezy morning earlier this month, Mark Peters was back at P.S. 321, talking to parents as they dropped off their children on the first day of school.</p>
        <p>''Next year,'' he was saying to Ms. Raphaelson, ''instead of being here on the first day, I'm going to be standing in front of John Jay High School talking to some of the same parents I'm talking to today.''</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' she replied. ''I was talking to my son and saying next year on this day you might be at John Jay. It's exciting. It's scary.''</p>
        <p>Rosemary Graham, the mother of a kindergartner at P.S. 321, chimed in: ''It's great,'' she said, beaming. ''You know, my husband was in the first first grade in this school, back in 1966. A group of parents came and helped this school become what it is today. I believe that can happen with John Jay.''</p>
