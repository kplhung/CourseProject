        <p>ONE thing you can say about us baby boomers is that there sure are a lot of us. Some people say that's the only thing that makes us special, but I suspect that they are just sick of hearing about us. Still, when we lock onto a trend, we make it ours, whether it was having the children who are now packing our schools to bursting or, eventually, when we begin dying in droves. In life or death, we make an impact.</p>
        <p>If you have tried, as I have, to buy a second home, you know  what I mean. It is another of life's pleasures that boomers have discovered, taken over and bid up to the stratosphere. The National Association of Realtors says that about 377,000 such homes were bought last year, up 31 percent from 1989. Prices have jumped 29 percent over the same period, with the median for a second home climbing from $99,200 to $127,800, though the increase may vary by region.</p>
        <p>No one should have to ask who is driving this. Goaded by the continuing promise of the expanding economy, boomers are buying the majority of second homes -- 63 percent of the total last year, according to the real estate group. And the median age of buyers was 43.</p>
        <p>''My guess is that purchases are at three or four times the rate of the previous generation,'' said Gary W. Eldred the author of ''The Complete Guide to Second Homes for Vacation, Retirement, and Investment'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999). ''There are many people with small children who are far wealthier than other generations were at a comparable age. These kinds of salaries were unheard-of in previous generations. This second-home phenomenon didn't exist then, because people didn't have the money.''</p>
        <p>All this buying has soaked up the supply and raised the prices of second homes in many areas. When I tried to jump on the trend last year and began looking for a weekend place in northwestern Connecticut, I was surprised to find prices almost as high as that of my primary residence. After weeks of looking, my wife and I gave up, realizing that we could not afford much more than a cabin in the woods. There went my dream of becoming a gentleman farmer.</p>
        <p>''You have to go back to the 60's to get this kind of robust economic expansion and low mortgage rates,'' said David A. Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors group. ''Take the strong economy and the fact that there are 75 million boomers entering their peak earning years -- that is giving rise to the increased demand for second homes.''</p>
        <p>But more than new wealth is driving boomers into second homes, Mr. Eldred said. Previous generations tended to buy second homes as they neared retirement or when the children were grown, he said. Boomers, too, are looking to retirement, but they are planning for it earlier, buying second homes in their 40's in anticipation of retiring, say, at 55. They are also buying them to give their young children a place to play and to gain a sanctuary from a stressful world.</p>
        <p>Karen Whitby, 50, who works for Salomon Smith Barney, said that she and her husband, Paul, 53, a lawyer, bought their second home at Woodridge Lake in Goshen, Conn., to be able to get away from city life for a while.</p>
        <p>''We both agreed that we wanted a place to go where we could completely relax,'' she said. ''We needed a break. We needed a change of scenery because of what we do five days a week. As much as we love Manhattan, we need to spend time away from it on the weekends.''</p>
        <p>Elaine LaRoche, also from Manhattan, isn't waiting for 55. Now in her late 40's, she recently retired as a managing director at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and bought a summer home in Connecticut to get away from the city. ''Quite frankly, with three children, the ability for them to be outside, have a circle of friends and be able to walk out the door without any issues is part of the family cycle,'' she said.</p>
        <p>WHEN there is the eternal pursuit of status, a stereotypical boomer trait. ''In my own conversations, people always want to drop where they have their second home -- 'I have a home in Siesta Key or Longboat Key' '' in Florida, Mr. Eldred said. ''They just love to drop the name -- 'Our home on the Vineyard' or in Aspen. They're all the cachet, name-brand locations.</p>
        <p>''When I was a kid, maybe families had an Airstream parked by the lake somewhere,'' he said. ''That was their vacation home.''</p>
        <p>Sounds like a retro trend. I'm sure Airstream prices have skyrocketed already.</p>
