        <p>I read with interest Adam Nagourney's article about the coming revival of ''The Best Man'' [''The Bard of American Politics, Still Campaigning,'' Sept. 3], in which he mentions that Gore Vidal had not made any changes in the original play to account for the intervening 40 years.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read with interest Adam Nagourney's article about the coming revival of ''The Best Man'' [''The Bard of American Politics, Still Campaigning,'' Sept. 3], in which he mentions that Gore Vidal had not made any changes in the original play to account for the intervening 40 years.</p>
        <p>Recently, Theater Forty in Los Angeles performed a staged reading of the play. The cast discovered at the first reading not only that they had a different version of the play from the one the director had, but also that the play had been revised four times since 1960. The version used was the one performed at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles in October 1987, produced by Robert Fryer and Martin Manulus and directed by Jose Ferrer, in which the ''frumpy'' Mrs. Gamadge was described as ''tall, elegant, black.''</p>
        <p>It appears that someone made the play more relevant to today's world. Let's hope it was Gore Vidal!</p>
