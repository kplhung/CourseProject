        <p>BILLY PAUCH cringes in the passenger's seat. He is a cautious rider, and as another car approaches about 100 yards down the road in this rural Hunterdon County town, he says  ''Oh, oh.''</p>
        <p>This timidity might seem surprising, given that Mr. Pauch spends much of his time driving cars as fast as he can. Since he started racing modified and sprint cars on Flemington Raceway's dirt track when he was in high school in the mid-70's, Mr. Pauch has won more than 500 races at anywhere from a few laps around a  3/8-mile track to more than 200 miles.</p>
        <p>He is one of about a half-dozen drivers who make their living racing dirt-track cars primarily on the New Jersey-eastern Pennsylvania circuit. He is the top driver this year at New Egypt Speedway, having won 13 of that track's Saturday night summer modified stock car series, and has won another 4 on Friday nights at East Windsor Speedway.</p>
        <p>And he is doing this at 43, when most dirt-track drivers have either taken to merely tuning someone else's engine or spending Saturdays in the stands with a Coke rather than choking down a couple of hours worth of dirt and clay behind the wheel.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking forward to doing this as long as I can,'' said Mr. Pauch behind a cheeseburger and birch beer lunch at a local pub.  ''It's all I've really ever done for a living for the last 20 years, and I think it's a whole lot of fun.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pauch's father, Roy, raced at dirt tracks from the 1950's through the 1970's, but never made a living from it (Billy's mother and brother were also amateur racers). There was the 100-acre dairy and vegetable farm near Stockton to tend to and, in winter, an auto mechanic business.</p>
        <p>But Billy Pauch got a little more serious about his cars.</p>
        <p>''I think farm boys have an advantage, being around tractors and trucks all the time, plus I had my dad racing a lot of weekends,'' Bill Pauch said. ''We raced on the streets, too. But from the time I was 17, I did it on tracks and really found it was going to be for me.''</p>
        <p>At the time, you couldn't race in New Jersey until you were 18, so Mr. Pauch started on Pennsylvania tracks. But each day he went to Hunterdon Central High, he saw the Flemington track a few hundred yards away and it became his home track for the next couple of decades.</p>
        <p>Flemington, which opened in 1915, was a legendary  5/8-mile dirt track, and Mr. Pauch said he loved negotiating its tight turns, sliding and skidding on the dirt. He won dozens of races there, but when the owners decided to cover the dirt with asphalt in 1991, Mr. Pauch reluctantly departed his home track.</p>
        <p>''Asphalt is O.K., a little harder on tires, but just not as fun,'' he said. ''I love sliding on the dirt track. There is more to it. You have to know more about track conditions, which change with rain, wind, temperature, time of the race. The dirt all changes and it takes more knowledge and experience.</p>
        <p>''On the other hand, I always say that the race is often won in the garage, before you even go out onto the track.''</p>
        <p>If that is so, Mr. Pauch gets most of his wins at the Pit Stop, the garage on the 100-acre spread he and his wife, Barbara, bought a few years ago along rural Route 519 between Frenchtown and Stockton. Mr. Pauch converted an old two-story chicken coop and outfitted it with several rooms, each dedicated to vital parts of his cars.  There is the big garage room for the chassis of his three main racing cars; an extra-clean engine room, which is mostly home to his father, an engine expert; a storage room for extra-wide racing tires, which Mr. Pauch sometimes sells at race sites; and another room for parts, to which other drivers sometimes come to buy Mr. Pauch's extras.</p>
        <p>In two upstairs rooms looking over the back acreage, is Mr. Pauch's cache of trophies. Auto racing trophies are often man-sized, so he needs all the wall and floor space he can to hold his dozens of trophies and smiling-at-the-pit photographs.</p>
        <p>''Someday, someday, maybe when I retire, I'll have time to catalog them, put them in their right places,'' he said. ''But right now, I have to keep at the cars.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pauch estimates he logs 12-hour days during the main March-to-October racing season, either tinkering with the cars during the week or racing. He said he often stayed late at the tracks, signing autographs or just talking to race fans.</p>
        <p>''You can't meet the big Winston Cup racers, but you can always talk to us,'' he said. ''The fans are why we make some money.''</p>
        <p>Most of the races at East Windsor and New Egypt pay $2,000 to $3,000 to the winner, with a scale sliding quickly downward to runners-up, so only winning is lucrative.  But since Mr. Pauch's tire and parts bill last month was $5,000 and he needed a new $32,000 motor this year, he stays in business by getting sponsors. They are not the big names that Winston Cup champs like Jeff Gordon get, but outfits like Art's Radiator in Flemington or Shammy Shine Car Washes and Greenfield Dodge in Lawrenceville.</p>
        <p>''Billy could have been one of those big guys,'' said Buffy Swanson, who with her husband, James, runs the races at New Egypt Speedway. But by the time he would have started traveling, he was getting a little older and it would have been tougher.  And now in his 40's, he is the best racer around here, which is apparently good enough for him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pauch thinks so. In the winter, some owners fly him to races in Florida, California and the Southwest just to have him drive their cars. He goes to the big trade shows and gets his own cars ready for the season, which starts in earnest around Easter. He gives some seminars to prospective drivers and then does on-track schools for novices.</p>
        <p>''And I sell cars sometimes to other drivers,'' he said. Then he chuckled and added,  ''And then I go out and beat them, so I know it's not just the car.''</p>
        <p>''I don't worry about what could have been,'' he said. ''It's been good for my family to always be around.</p>
        <p>''I don't know; I'm a little anxious for my son,'' he added, referring to 13-year-old Billy, who has been racing go-karts for the last three years. ''But it's nice to have three generations in a family doing something together. You can't ask for much more.''</p>
