        <p>One way for mutual fund investors to keep their heads above water this year has been to own a money market fund.</p>
        <p>Now yielding about 6 percent at an annual rate, money funds are paying almost as well as the average stock or bond fund -- without those markets' jarring ups and downs. The average stock fund tracked by Bloomberg is up 5.1 percent this year, through Wednesday, and the average bond fund has gained 4.7 percent.</p>
        <p>Against such modest competition, money funds have proved more popular than ever. Their assets have climbed to a new high -- $1.75 trillion, according to the Investment Company Institute.</p>
        <p>That is more than twice the $800 billion that investors now have in bond funds. Just seven years ago, bond funds were bigger than money funds, which specialize in securities with lives of less than a year, like commercial paper.</p>
        <p>Although money funds are not federally insured, they are considered safe. But they still have their drawbacks: their yields may fall very quickly in periods when short-term interest rates decline, and their long-term returns can be disappointing after taxes and inflation.</p>
        <p>Investors seem protected for now: inflation remains tame and the Federal Reserve has been leaving interest rates steady after raising them several times since the middle of last year. But the trend could change if the economy slows more than expected.</p>
