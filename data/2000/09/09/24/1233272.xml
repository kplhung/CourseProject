        <p>Olympic athletes in second-skin swimsuits are not the only ones coming out of Australia sporting racy styles. Ned Goodwin, a sommelier from Sydney who moved to New York four years ago, has his own full-bodied style. When working at Veritas, a restaurant in the Flatiron district known for its extensive wine list, he sticks to an all-business look, but after hours he uncorks his wild-and-crazy fashion sensibility. ''I was brought up in a city that's very body-conscious,'' said Mr. Goodwin, 31, who grew up surfing at Bondi Beach, where the Olympic volleyball games are being held. ''I like clothes that are bright, flamboyant and bawdy.''</p>

        <p>Olympic athletes in second-skin swimsuits are not the only ones coming out of Australia sporting racy styles. Ned Goodwin, a sommelier from Sydney who moved to New York four years ago, has his own full-bodied style. When working at Veritas, a restaurant in the Flatiron district known for its extensive wine list, he sticks to an all-business look, but after hours he uncorks his wild-and-crazy fashion sensibility. ''I was brought up in a city that's very body-conscious,'' said Mr. Goodwin, 31, who grew up surfing at Bondi Beach, where the Olympic volleyball games are being held. ''I like clothes that are bright, flamboyant and bawdy.''</p>
        <p>Here, Mr. Goodwin wears an outback style: a cow print hat and a tan nylon vest with orange lining, both from Camouflage, at 141 Eighth Avenue (17th Street). His pants, snug, straight-legged, in olive plaid, are from Tokyo, where he is the occasional host of a cable television show called ''Vintage.'' On air, Mr. Goodwin goes for strait-laced suits, though he prefers his global Crocodile Dundee image. ''That whole rock star, swagger thing is cool again,'' Mr. Goodwin said. ''The new hustler look is my version of the rock star.''</p>
