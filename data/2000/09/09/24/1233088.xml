        <p>Six ships from Premier Cruise Lines abruptly halted service on Sept. 14 after they were seized by creditors, cutting short the vacations of about 2,800 passengers in ports from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Nassau, the Bahamas, to Cozumel, Mexico.</p>
        <p>Five ships -- the Big Red Boat III, Oceanic, Rembrandt, Seabreeze and Seawind Crown -- were seized on orders from Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the investment banking firm that holds the mortgages.

        <p>Six ships from Premier Cruise Lines abruptly halted service on Sept. 14 after they were seized by creditors, cutting short the vacations of about 2,800 passengers in ports from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Nassau, the Bahamas, to Cozumel, Mexico.</p>
        <p>Five ships -- the Big Red Boat III, Oceanic, Rembrandt, Seabreeze and Seawind Crown -- were seized on orders from Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the investment banking firm that holds the mortgages. It said it acted after learning that other creditors might try to impound the vessels. A sixth ship, the Big Red Boat II, under charter to Premier, was taken from service by another creditor, Oceanic Marine Ltd.</p>
        <p>Premier and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette both said that all passengers were provided transportation home. The cruise company added that fares and deposits were covered by the Federal Maritime Commission. A phone message at Premier, (800) 327-9766, said procedures for refunds would ''be available in the near future,'' through existing Premier phone numbers.</p>
        <p>Premier, based in Port Canavaral, Fla., has struggled for almost a decade. It lost $20 million last year and laid off almost 10 percent of its work force in June. Alan Twaits, a Premier senior vice president,  said the company had not yet decided whether to file for bankruptcy protection.</p>
