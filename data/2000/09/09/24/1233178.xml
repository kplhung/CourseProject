        <p>ROBERT E. GREER is serving his third term on the White Plains City Council. He's learned a lot about politics, and now he is passing it on in a course called ''So You Want to Run for Public Office.''</p>
        <p>Offered by the Purchase College Continuing Education Department on Wednesdays, Oct. 4 through Nov. 1, from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., classes will be held at the Social Sciences Building, Room 1002, at Purchase.</p>
        <p>The 63-year-old Mr. Greer, a Democrat and a retired vice president for finance of an insurance company, will address a variety of issues, beginning with the basic question: Are you the type who can psychologically handle running for office?</p>
        <p>''It's the old adage -- If you can't stand the heat, don't go in the kitchen,'' Mr. Greer said. ''You have to be able to face criticism and rejection. You've got to be able to take it if you're knocking on doors, asking for votes, and someone tells you to shove off.''</p>
        <p>You should also ask yourself honestly what your reasons for running are, he said.</p>
        <p>''Do you really want to serve the community?'' Mr. Greer asked. ''Or are you just running because you're angry about one particular issue? In local politics, citizens sometimes get so enraged about one issue that they decide to run for office themselves. That's not a very good reason.''</p>
        <p>The councilman will also address practical issues: how to get information from the Board of Elections; how to determine the demographic makeup of your community and its voting patterns; how to find volunteers. Also covered will be budgeting, fund-raising, preparing speeches and devising schedules for public appearances.</p>
        <p>''You want to find out when there are parades, festivals, holidays where there will be a big crowd,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Greer will deal not only with what happens when one wins but also with defeat.</p>
        <p>''On election night,'' he said, ''plan for a celebration but be prepared with both a victory and a concession speech.</p>
        <p>''But remember, win or lose, you will have participated in a process which is the cornerstone of our democracy, made a lot of new friends, seen parts of your community you might never have known and learned a great deal about yourself.''</p>
        <p>He said he was teaching the course because he thought it could familiarize people with aspects of political life.</p>
        <p>To register for the course, call (914) 251-6500 or send an e-mail message to Purchase College at conted@purchase.edu; the cost is $50.</p>
