        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio reached a tentative agreement yesterday to forgo the use of millions of dollars in soft money for advertising in the New York Senate race. But the deal included several conditions and provisions that could derail it and came just a day after talks on a similar proposal collapsed.</p>
        <p>''We have an agreement -- it appears,'' Mr. Lazio said at his headquarters last night. ''I said that yesterday, I know.''</p>
        <p>In a separate statement after Mr. Lazio's acceptance of a new offer made by Mrs. Clinton earlier in the day, her spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said: ''Nine months ago Hillary Clinton called for the elimination of soft-money issue advertising and independent expenditures from this race. We hope that today we have finally achieved her goal.''</p>
        <p>Under the proposal made by Mrs. Clinton during a campaign appearance in Manhattan, both sides would place a ban on television and radio advertisements paid for by political parties with so-called soft money, largely unregulated contributions that enable candidates to circumvent legal limits on fund-raising.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio would also appeal to independent groups like abortion-rights organizations or police unions to refrain from broadcasting ads on their behalf, which would leave the campaign committees as the only advertisers in the contest. But no one knows whether all of the groups will comply.</p>
        <p>Few other campaigns nationwide have barred the use of soft money, or commercials financed by it. Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin forsook soft money in his campaign two years ago. And in the 1996 Senate race in Massachusetts, Gov. William Weld and Senator John Kerry agreed to limit overall spending, including a ban on most soft-money.</p>
        <p>If the agreement in New York holds, Mr. Lazio will have succeeded in eliminating from the race a major source of financing for Mrs. Clinton's campaign at a time when he has surpassed her in the last few months in direct fund-raising. In addition, Mr. Lazio is likely to claim vindication for his decision to aggressively promote this issue during their contentious debate on Sept. 13, having seized on something that could give his campaign new heft.</p>
        <p>For her part, Mrs. Clinton managed to limit the scope of the agreement sought by Mr. Lazio while claiming the issue as her own because she first called for a ban in December 1999.</p>
        <p>Her counteroffer yesterday was not the extensive ban first proposed by Mr. Lazio. It does not include other popular uses of soft money, for activities like get-out-the-vote campaigns and direct mailings, and does not require campaigns to refund soft-money gifts. She said the voter campaigns were legitimate activities of political parties, while direct mailings would be too difficult to restrict.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's plan also rests on a vague and potentially uncontrollable means of enforcement: If one side breaks the ban with an ad, the other is entitled to do so ''proportionately'' -- that is, by spending the same amount of soft money for an ad of its own. Mrs. Clinton has consistently rejected a suggestion by Mr. Lazio that a bipartisan group, led by the architects of campaign finance reform -- Senators John McCain and Feingold -- monitor compliance. She said all New Yorkers could keep track themselves by watching television and listening to the radio.</p>
        <p>''It is simple,'' Mrs. Clinton said at the Bank Street College of Education. ''We will keep soft-money-issue ads off the air if they keep theirs off the air. Just the two campaign committees should be on the air advertising their campaigns. If any supporters of either candidate should violate this, the other side could respond proportionately.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said she had secured the commitments of the various Democratic Party organizations that would be affected by the prohibition, as well as the Working Families Party and Liberal Party, which have also endorsed her candidacy. She said Mr. Lazio needed to do the same among Republicans and Conservatives by tomorrow, a deadline Mr. Lazio said he could and would meet.</p>
        <p>The deal would not take effect until Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton said, because the state Democratic Party has already bought television ads  that run through Wednesday. Mr. Lazio's campaign initially objected to the Wednesday deadline, saying the state ads must be withdrawn by tomorrow, but Mr. Lazio backed off that demand. He also wanted an  agreement drafted by lawyers, but he relented on that as well.</p>
        <p>''What is important here is that it appears we have an agreement in principle to ban soft money from both campaigns and keep all outside groups out,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''But it is important, in the words of former President Ronald Reagan, that we must trust and verify.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign said it favored this deal because Mrs. Clinton  no longer insisted that he alone had to stop advertisements by groups that support him. On Friday, Mrs. Clinton suggested that Mr. Lazio should get written assurances from those groups, but insisted she did not need to do the same.</p>
        <p>She said yesterday that she still believed there was a difference between most groups that back her candidacy, such as the environmental group Sierra Club, and those that support Mr. Lazio's, particularly those, like the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton, that were created for the sole purpose of opposing her Senate run. But as a start, she added, it was more important to focus on the political parties' involvement.</p>
        <p>Henry Berger, a prominent Democratic election lawyer in New York City, said enforcing the deal could prove to be its downfall. Mrs. Clinton has always maintained that she does not have the power to stop independent groups from advertising on her behalf. Until yesterday, Mrs. Clinton had never called on such groups to step aside and some, like the National Abortion Rights Action League, previously had indicated that they  had no intention of doing so.</p>
        <p>''The plus is that it is a first step that may limit soft-money expenditures; it may in fact work,'' Mr. Berger said. ''The downside is, if the advocacy groups simply don't go along with it, it may break down.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berger said the ban might also have come too late to have a big effect on the election, to be held Nov. 7. ''It is now just over six weeks before the election,'' he said. ''It is very late. It is sort of like trying to turn the Queen Mary around.''</p>
        <p>Soft money, which is raised by party committees for get-out-the-vote and other party-building activities, is separate from the so-called hard money raised directly by political campaigns. Hard money is subject to federal limits -- $1,000 per person in the general election.</p>
        <p>If the agreement should stick, it would be extremely beneficial to Mr. Lazio by depriving Mrs. Clinton of a disproportionately large amount of money. She has collected millions of dollars in soft money, and Mr. Lazio generally has not. And in recent months, her fund-raising of hard-money has grown sluggish. New campaign finance reports indicated she took in just $3.3 million in a seven-week period this summer, while Mr. Lazio raised $10.7 million.</p>
        <p>Both have benefited from political party ads, but Mrs. Clinton has relied far more heavily on her party for commercials that criticize Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>In many respects Mr. Lazio stood to gain even if there were no agreement, as he has chosen to exploit Mrs. Clinton's reliance on soft money as evidence of her close links to special interests groups and her association with President Clinton's often-criticized fund-raising tactics.</p>
        <p>Unable to shake the perception that she has been unenthusiastic about the soft-money issue since Mr. Lazio called for restrictions at the close of their debate, Mrs. Clinton made her counteroffer yesterday after declaring that ''enough is enough.'' She said her campaign would suffer because of the ban, but cast her willingness to take that risk as a sign of her integrity, particularly since she has gotten no indication among voters that New Yorkers consider soft money an important issue.</p>
        <p>''Well, I made a commitment to this principle over a year ago, and disadvantaged or not, I will honor it because it is the right thing to do,'' she said.</p>
