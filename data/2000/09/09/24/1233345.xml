        <p>BY the end of next year, airline passengers may be able to send and receive e-mail, trade stocks, surf the Internet and watch television -- using just one screen -- at 40,000 feet and 500 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>That is when Connexion, a two-way broadband service announced in April by the Boeing Company, is expected to be operating on North American routes of major airlines.</p>
        <p>''People on airplanes have always been a bit disenfranchised,'' said Kenneth A. Medlin, vice president and general manager of commercial information systems at Boeing. ''Watch people in airports, trying to get one more thing done. Watch them rushing down the runway on their cell phones. We think people want to stay informed'' while they are in the sky.</p>
        <p>The system, which Boeing expects will cost passengers about $17.50 an hour, uses 1,000 tiny antenna modules, joined in a single grid, to steer radio beams to different satellites. A cable connects the antennas to a computer in the aircraft, and the computer is linked to a conventional Web and e-mail server.</p>
        <p>The service has been tested over the last three years and is already available on some private jets and government planes. No deals have yet been made with major airlines, but Connexion does have agreements with CNN and CNBC for live broadcasts.</p>
        <p>A similar service, called In-Flight Network, is being developed by the News Corporation, and others are being proposed. Connexion says it is the only one that will provide two-way broadband service.</p>
        <p>''We've really blended our business and personal lives together, Mr. Medlin said, adding that if he could have been online during a business trip last week, he could have done some work and freed up some weekend time for his family. ''I think giving people time back is an incredibly powerful force.''</p>
