        <p>Four years ago, the Atlanta Games played on with them in the audience, not on the track. Marion Jones was recovering from a broken foot, Maurice Greene from a bruised ego, having failed to qualify for the 100 meters at the United States track and field trials. Sitting in tears as Donovan Bailey of Canada won the gold medal, Greene told himself, ''This will never happen again without me.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, Greene ran a wonderfully patient and blistering race to win a gold medal in the 100 meters in 9.87 seconds. He did not threaten his world record of 9.79 seconds, but his time was superb into a headwind and he demonstrated a consistency and technical mastery that not even Carl Lewis could equal. This was the 31st time that Greene had run the 100 under 10 seconds, twice as many as Lewis had during his own brilliant career.</p>

        <p>Four years ago, the Atlanta Games played on with them in the audience, not on the track. Marion Jones was recovering from a broken foot, Maurice Greene from a bruised ego, having failed to qualify for the 100 meters at the United States track and field trials. Sitting in tears as Donovan Bailey of Canada won the gold medal, Greene told himself, ''This will never happen again without me.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, Greene ran a wonderfully patient and blistering race to win a gold medal in the 100 meters in 9.87 seconds. He did not threaten his world record of 9.79 seconds, but his time was superb into a headwind and he demonstrated a consistency and technical mastery that not even Carl Lewis could equal. This was the 31st time that Greene had run the 100 under 10 seconds, twice as many as Lewis had during his own brilliant career.</p>
        <p>Moments earlier, in the women's 100 meters, Jones burst from the starting blocks and accelerated with a bounding spring as if the track were a trampoline. Essentially, the race was over in the first five meters. She accelerated into her long searing stride and skipped across the finish line in 10.75 seconds, the fastest time in the world for a woman this year and the preamble to her attempt to become the first female athlete in track and field to win five gold medals in the same Olympics.</p>
        <p>This was the first time American athletes had won the men's and women's 100-meter sprints since Lewis and Florence Griffith Joyner were awarded first place at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea. Lewis actually finished second in that race but was later declared the winner after Ben Johnson of Canada was stripped of his gold medal for testing positive for anabolic steroids.</p>
        <p>So dominant was Jones's performance tonight that her margin of victory -- 37 hundredths of a second -- was the greatest in the Olympic 100 meters since Marjorie Jackson of Australia won a hand-timed race in 1952. Tonight, Ekaterini Thanou of Greece finished far behind in 11.12 seconds for the silver, and Tanya Lawrence of Jamaica won the bronze in 11.18. This was the 35th consecutive victory at 100 meters for Jones over the past three years, and even before tonight's race began, there was no doubt even among the competitors who would win.</p>
        <p>''I was running only for the silver medal,'' Thanou said.</p>
        <p>Jones reached the finish line with an ecstatic vault but soon broke into tears as she hugged her mother, Marion Toler, and grabbed a flag of Belize, her mother's home country. She had been anticipating this moment since the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. As an 8-year-old, she had traveled with her family from their suburban Southern California home to see the torch relay. That night, she went to her room and wrote on a chalkboard, ''I want to be an Olympic champion.''</p>
        <p>Finally, at age 24, she is. Before her senior year of high school, Jones declined a spot on the American 4 x 100-meter relay at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain. Depending on who is telling the story, Jones either wanted her first gold to come in an individual event or her mother would not let her participate because her grades were insufficient.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, a broken foot sustained in her second favorite sport, basketball, prohibited her from competing in the Atlanta Games and she had to watch as her boyfriend, now husband, C. J. Hunter, competed in the shot-put.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Jones crossed the finish line in a tangle of emotions -- joy, relief, the shedding of her Olympic frustrations, the expectation that four more gold medals are possible in the 200 meters, long jump, 4 x 100-meter relay and 4 x 400-meter relay.</p>
        <p>''This is 16 years of believing and dreaming about this,'' Jones said of her emotional outburst at the finish. ''It comes down to one moment and one race. There's a lot of pressure. To have it all realized is a huge relief.''</p>
        <p>She felt the burden of expectation of her attempt at five gold medals, and a swarm of moths bothered her at the start, but it became clear to the 110,000 at Olympic Stadium tonight that she won the race shortly after she left the starting blocks.</p>
        <p>Jones's starts had been troublesome this year, but tonight she drove low and hard from the blocks, hands open, chopping the air, the exertion of breathing in her cheeks, a calm insistence in her face, an exquisite fluidity in her stride as her knees piston-pumped her toward the finish line in silvery spikes.</p>
        <p>''It was beautiful,'' said Karen Dennis, coach of the American women's track team. ''Marion did what she does best -- explode out, lift her knees, finish strong. She looked like she was having fun.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, it appears that Jones's attempt to win five gold medals has been seriously threatened by uncertainty in the American relays. No other American woman reached the final of the 100, compared with three from the Bahamas and two from Jamaica. And no American woman even advanced to the semifinals of the 400 meters. Inger Miller of Los Angeles, the only real challenger to Jones in the sprints, withdrew from the 100 with a strained hamstring, and remains questionable for the 200 and the 4 x 100 relay.</p>
        <p>''I feel we are still going to be in the hunt,'' Dennis said. ''It takes four people to run a  relay. I don't think we're going to lead the whole way. If we can keep it close for Marion, I think we can still win.''</p>
        <p>Greene, who is 26, has now demonstrated a reliability on the track that only Lewis and Johnson had previously achieved. With a mastery of the science of sprinting that belies his playful behavior, Greene has now won two consecutive world championships and an Olympic gold medal at 100 meters. He will attempt to win a second gold by anchoring the American 4 x 100-meter relay on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Greene dedicated his victory to his coach, John Smith, with whom he began training after the Atlanta Games. Determined to improve after sitting on the sidelines, Greene packed his things into a sport utility vehicle and drove to Los Angeles with his father from his hometown of Kansas City, Kan.</p>
        <p>He was a talented but largely unknown sprinter and it was Smith who turned him into the world's fastest man.</p>
        <p>Smith also coaches Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, who won the silver medal tonight in 9.99 seconds. Obadele Thompson of Barbados took the bronze in 10.04. Athletes trained by Smith have now produced six gold medals in the sprints. The victories serve as consolation for the fact that Smith had been a favorite at 400 meters at the 1972 Munich Olympics only to become injured before those Games and to withdraw 80 meters into the race.</p>
        <p>''I know he has a big hole in his heart,'' Greene said. ''I can't fill the hole he has, but I hope I can put a little back for him. There's nothing like winning a gold medal in the Olympics. I owe him a lot.''</p>
        <p>Greene has become the embodiment of Smith's coaching style. He emerged from the blocks calmly, keeping his head down for half the race, instead of popping up and accelerating immediately at full speed. The idea was to delay his top-end speed until he reached 70 meters, leaving himself a shorter distance to the finish line.</p>
        <p>The cords in his neck bulging, Greene finally became fully upright after 23 strides and he took control of the race with tactical brilliance.</p>
        <p>''When everyone wants to get up and run, he stays down and drives,'' said Boldon, who trains with Greene at U.C.L.A. and who won the bronze medal at the Atlanta Games.</p>
        <p>After touching hands with Greene during the semifinals, Boldon slowed slightly, hoping to draw an outside lane for the final. Both sprinters tend to drift slightly, and, in an outside lane, Boldon would avoid more contact with Greene.</p>
        <p>He drew Lane 8, but, on the outside, he did not have Greene to drag him along toward the finish.</p>
        <p>''The way he ran tonight, he destroyed us,'' Boldon said.</p>
        <p>Greene wished Jones luck, saying he would not try such an ambitious feat. He said he had grown tired after running four rounds apiece of the 100 and 200 meters, plus the 4 x 100 relay, at the 1999 world track and field championships in Seville, Spain. Jones won the 100 but pulled up with back spasms in the 200 in Seville.</p>
        <p>''I wish her the best because I wouldn't try it,'' Greene said. ''She's a phenomenal athlete, and it's going to take a phenomenal athlete to accomplish this. I think she can do it. I hope her body holds up and doesn't break down like in Seville, so everyone can see her reach her goals.''</p>
