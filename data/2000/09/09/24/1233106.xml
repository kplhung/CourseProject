        <p>THEY number in the hundreds, the scattered vacant lots that like ugly bruises mar the streets of this city's South Ward, which sits in the shadow of Newark International Airport. But that situation may soon change.</p>
        <p>Under a redevelopment plan approved by the Newark City Council last spring a majority of the lots -- 680 of 923 -- are to be redeveloped into mostly two-family homes, with some one-  or three-family houses. The 680 lots, of varying sizes, are to yield 625 homes.</p>
        <p>The city owns the lots -- some contiguous ones make up nearly entire blocks -- and has designated 17 private developers for the rebuilding.</p>
        <p>(Two-thirds of the remaining lots are owned by the city's Public Housing Authority and are to be used for public housing. Most of the other lots are to be used for industrial development.)</p>
        <p>All the homes are to be developed in the next two to three years without any public money. They will be sold at market-rate prices, generally ranging from $135,000 to $200,000, with the three-family homes rising to $249,900. Potential buyers will not be subject to any income eligibility requirements.</p>
        <p>Planners said that the houses would be affordable to families with annual household incomes of $50,000 to $60,000 and would draw interest from both Newark residents and others. Among the reasons cited for the interest is the area's location next to several highways, including I-78 and I-95, the New Jersey Turnpike. The local Routes 1-9 and 22 are nearby as well.</p>
        <p>The city's hope is that the housing will help bring new economic life to the neighborhood, which is still struggling to recover  from the flight of residents and businesses after the 1967 race riots.</p>
        <p>''It's been 30 years in the coming,'' Donald Bradley, who represents the South Ward and is the president of the Newark City Council, said of the redevelopment plan. ''Except for some sporadic building of low- and moderate-income housing there has been no real new development in the South Ward since the 1967 disturbance.''</p>
        <p>The new housing is the centerpiece of the South Ward redevelopment plan. Mr. Bradley, a 36-year resident of the neighborhood, said that future phases included renovating abandoned buildings as well as helping existing homeowners improve their homes. There are also plans for a new high school and an athletic center. An industrial park, with 100,000 square feet of space, was also recently completed in the neighborhood, at Bergen Street and Hawthorne Avenue, and up to 80,000 more square feet of space is planned for the park. ''This development is a jump start,'' Mr. Bradley said, ''but in order for the neighborhood to come back we can't just build new housing, or just low- and moderate-income housing.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Sharpe James, who lives in the South Ward, said the plan was ''all part of a holistic approach'' to reviving Newark, as well as to increasing the homeownership rate in the city, which has risen since 1984 to 26 percent from 16 percent. The goal is 50 percent, Mayor James said, without indicating a deadline.</p>
        <p>The new market-rate homes in the South Ward, the mayor said, are part of the city's plan to encourage the development of 2,000 such homes citywide this year. He said that to ensure that the South Ward houses are built, the lots will be released to the developers in clusters, and the developers will be required to build the homes in those clusters within a year to 18 months.</p>
        <p>''If they succeed they will get more lots,'' he said, noting that after the South Ward, the intent is to move into the West Ward.</p>
        <p>Of the 680 lots in the South Ward, Summit Real Estate Developers of Westfield is to  develop 302 into up to 280 mostly two-family homes, with possibly a few one-family houses. The rest of the lots are divided among the remaining 16 developers, including A&amp;A Construction of Colonia and Triple A Developers of Newark. Most of the developers have signed contracts with the city and are moving forward to secure site plan approvals for the homes from the city.</p>
        <p>Model homes are expected to begin to take shape as early as next month, with initial construction to start before year's end. Some of the houses will be traditionally constructed, while others will be developed using panelized construction or manufactured in a factory and assembled on site.</p>
        <p>Alfred L. Faiella, the city's deputy mayor  for housing and economic development, said that to keep the homes affordable the city would sell most of the developers the lots, which average 33 by 100 feet, for $1 a square foot, or $3,300 each. Summit, which is planning to put up modular homes, has agreed to pay more.</p>
        <p>BECAUSE most of the homes are two-family, he said, the rental apartments will provide buyers with income to help with mortgage payments and other expenses.</p>
        <p>Real estate taxes on the houses, Mr. Faiella said, will be abated for the first five years, reducing them on average to $3,000 a year from the $4,500 to $5,000 they would be without the abatement. The abatement may also be extended for up to 20 more years, he said. And mortgages at or below market-rate interest and with low or zero down payments will also be made available to qualified buyers through several banks.</p>
        <p>The sale of the lots is expected to generate about $5 million, and their redevelopment to bring in about $1.8 million in tax revenues a year to Newark, Mr. Faiella said. He said the lots had reverted to city ownership because of nonpayment of taxes. The tidy row houses that once stood on the lots were razed long ago.</p>
        <p>Through the 1960's the South Ward was primarily a residential neighborhood where many professional families lived in grand houses, mainly in the Clinton Hill and Weequahic areas. Today, many middle-class black families live in well-kept parts of the neighborhood. Other parts, such as the far eastern sector, where many of the vacant lots exist, have suffered greatly from abandonment.</p>
        <p>In recent years, as the national and state economies blossomed, Newark's long-awaited revival started to take hold. Much activity has centered on the city's downtown, with the construction of its new performing arts center, a minor league baseball stadium and the promise of more, including a sports arena, residences and shops.</p>
        <p>The development push has filtered into the neighborhoods, primarily the Central Ward, which was ground zero for the riots as well as hub for much of the city's high-rise public housing. Many of those towers have been or are being demolished and replaced with low-rise town houses. That replacement program, along with new construction, has brought some 1,400 new housing units into the Central Ward over the last two years, Mr. Faiella said.</p>
        <p>The concentration of residential activity in that area was done by design to ''show enough of an impact to start a ripple effect in commercial development,'' he said, pointing to possible plans by Kmart to open a store on an 11-acre triangular site bounded by Jones, Springfield and South Orange Avenues. The objective is to have the same thing happen in the South Ward, he said.</p>
        <p>That approach appealed to the principals of Summit Real Estate Developers. ''Bringing so many houses to an unproven area will create a critical mass and, in turn, reduce the risk,'' said Arthur Fefferman, a partner in Summit with Peter Weissbrod, Stuart Fuchsman and Richard Goldberger.</p>
        <p>The partners are no strangers to such projects. They are developing 69 scattered lots in Plainfield into one- and two-family homes and plan to build similar projects in other cities. Mr. Fefferman said the partners were also drawn to Newark because ''the city is going through a renaissance, and the demand for housing is strong, but there is a lack of supply, especially of affordable housing.''</p>
        <p>The two-family homes, generally with 2,400 to 2,500 square feet, will cost $184,900 to $200,000, depending on house and lot size. The one-family houses, with 1,350 square feet, will sell for $149,900. They will take shape in 18 clusters, each with 7 to 20 homes.  All the houses are two stories, with garage, and will be built in a factory, mainly by Simplex Industries of Scranton, Pa., and assembled on site. The overall cost of developing the up to 280 homes is in excess of $60 million, Mr. Fefferman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Faiella said Summit was designated to develop so many lots because ''they have a good track record and are well financed.'' He added that because Summit wanted the opportunity to test selling modular homes in Newark at market prices, the developer had  agreed to pay more for its 302 lots: five percent of the selling price of each home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fefferman said that Summit, as it has done in Plainfield, would develop two model homes to use to market the rest of the homes, which are to be built as they are sold. The model homes are to go up on Hillside Avenue at Runyon Street and are scheduled to open in mid-October.</p>
        <p>The homes being planned by Triple A Construction and A&amp;A Developers are to be traditional construction. Triple A is to build 33 two- and three-family homes, and A&amp;A is to build 25, said Manny Rosa, who is a consultant for both developers and runs the Rosa Agency, a residential real estate company in Newark.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosa said that the two-family homes would generally have 3,000 square feet and, depending on lot size, cost from $165,000 to $224,900, and that the three-family houses would have 4,500 square feet and sell for $239,000 to $249,900. All the homes will have brick facades, either front or back balconies and one- or two-car garages.</p>
        <p>He said that both developers are expected to start construction in January and will build the houses in phases even before they are sold. ''We believe in the Newark market and that there is a demand in the South Ward for new housing from middle-class families,'' Mr. Rosa said. ''This is a new era for the city.''</p>
