        <p>WHEN the idea of tapping the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve was floated last winter, in the face of high home heating prices in the Northeast, no one was more skeptical than Vice President Al Gore. Oil-producing nations, he explained to a Massachusetts audience in February, could easily counter the move. ''All they would have to do is cut back a little bit on supply and they'd wipe out any impact from releasing oil from that reserve,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>That analysis of the realpolitik of the oil market rings as true today as it did then. But the approach of a presidential election has a way of altering the way candidates parse the laws of supply and demand. Thus the decision, announced on Friday, to tap the reserve for 30 million barrels.</p>
        <p>There is no question that Mr. Gore, stung by Gov. George W. Bush's criticism that the administration has stumbled along with no energy policy, feels he is facing a political crisis. Inventories of oil are running low and everyone from truckers to commuters in S.U.V.'s is getting angry. The Energy Department predicted early this month that home heating oil bills would be 30 percent higher than last winter, and today that looks conservative. Inconveniently for Mr. Gore, the people most dependent on oil for heat live in many of the swing states in the Midwest, which are likely to determine the outcome of the election, now only 44 days away.</p>
        <p>But is there an oil crisis?</p>
        <p>If you ask the oil experts, the answer is no, or at least not yet. Rather, there is a mismatch between supply and demand that is causing prices to spike upward and has begun to prompt hoarding.</p>
        <p>''What we have here is a classic price shock, and it goes back to the Asian financial crisis,'' said Daniel Yergin, who has tracked the oil markets since the Arab embargoes and sees today's problems as very different.  After the financial crisis hit, in 1997, he said, ' companies cut back on their investments around the world..''</p>
        <p>At the time, everyone was guessing that it would take Southeast Asia years to pull itself out of the hole it had dug. Few expected the boom in the United States to last this long, or for Europe to be posting strong growth.</p>
        <p>So in an industry where profits depend on managing the cost of exploration and inventory, caution prevailed. Exploration firms dug fewer holes and scaled back on new storage facilities. The result, as calculated by Mr. Yergin's firm, Cambridge Energy Associates, is that ''world productive capacity is seven million barrels a day less than we would have otherwise expected.'' And last year, with the price of oil low, OPEC began cutting back production. Even so, by most estimates, the world  produces two or three million barrels a day more than the 77 million barrels it burns. But even if it were being distributed and stockpiled with precision, there would not be much left over. And meanwhile, demand is strong -- even in places that a few years ago most experts expected would still be fighting off recession.</p>
        <p>That's not necessarily a crisis -- but it could become one fairly quickly. The Pentagon warns that  Saddam Hussein might cut off some of Iraq's production or that his renewed threats against Kuwait may force it to cut it off for him. And if any kind of natural or man-made disaster -- hurricane, earthquake, a further political meltdown in Indonesia or a confrontation in the Taiwan Straits -- there is little margin for error.</p>
        <p>Or, as Mr. Yergin puts it, ''We're at the extreme end of a market cycle. That is always when risk is highest.''</p>
        <p>All these realities collided in the Roosevelt Room of the White House the other day with the political demands of two campaigns -- Al Gore's and Hillary Rodham Clinton's. Just as Mr. Gore is worried about the Midwest, Mrs. Clinton is worried about upstate New York. And neither could make a convincing case that the administration was easing anyone's pain.</p>
        <p>So with prices rising and the election ever nearer, a furious debate broke out within the administration about whether to tap the 570-million-barrel strategic reserve, a legacy of the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.</p>
        <p>That put the ball in the court of Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who had had a bad year in Washington,  blamed for doing too little to keep oil flowing in and nuclear secrets at Los Alamos labs from flowing out. Mr. Richardson wrote President Clinton arguing for the release of 60 million barrels of oil.</p>
        <p>Yes, he acknowledged, the emergency reserve was created in case of major supply disruptions, not to manipulate prices. But those who live in Michigan or Pennsylvania and are paying exorbitant amounts for  heating oil, he argued, probably don't care whether the cause of the problem is Saddam or Exxon. Voters just want it solved.</p>
        <p>Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, a veteran of many currency market interventions (some that worked, some that flopped) took the other side. Mr. Richardson's proposal, he said in a memo that was almost instantly leaked in an effort to embarrass Mr. Summers, would ''set a dangerous precedent.'' Echoing Mr. Gore's point last February, he noted that OPEC could easily neutralize the release of the stockpiled oil. He suggested that oil traders, seeing the approach of an election, might dismiss any action as a political ploy rather than a commitment to reverse oil prices.</p>
        <p>He even invoked the name of Washington's other great power, Alan Greenspan, declaring that ''Chairman Greenspan and I believe that using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at this time, as proposed by D.O.E., would be a major and substantial policy mistake.''</p>
        <p>Maybe so, but in Washington losing an election is also considered a major mistake. So on Thursday the vice president stood in front of some oil tanks in southern Maryland and publicly called on his boss to  begin opening the spigots on the reserve. That hardly came as a surprise to Mr. Clinton, who had gotten a call from Mr. Gore two days earlier, informing him of the new campaign initiative.</p>
        <p>And on Friday, a happy-looking Mr. Richardson announced the release of the 30 million barrels, about 5 percent of the reserve, a far larger amount than Mr. Gore had sought in public. The White House hopes that it is enough to drive down prices without leaving Mr. Gore  vulnerable to Mr. Bush's charge that the release ''threatens national security.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush may have a hard time arguing that the release leaves America in peril, but he has a point in his criticism of the Clinton-Gore administration's energy policy. When oil was trading at $20 a barrel, as it was a few years ago, few in Washington worried about the oil market. The administration focused on the economic problems in front of it -- keeping the world economy on an even keel -- and didn't spend much time looking at what might happen if demand for oil picked up while inventory and production capacity were still low.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush is almost certainly right when he says the administration is redefining the purpose of the  reserve, which was created to protect against real supply disruptions. ''We think this is a rainy day,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''We think that between now and winter, because of the low stocks of home heating oil, we're in danger of potential disruption.''</p>
        <p>And, by remarkable coincidence, the 30 days of government-led oil infusions will end just two weeks before the election. Then, Mr. Richardson said, there will still be time to ''reassess.'' Whether he meant reassessing the oil supplies, or the polls, or both, was not entirely clear.</p>
