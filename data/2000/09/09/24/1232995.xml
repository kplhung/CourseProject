        <p>This House</p>
        <p>Has Fallen</p>
        <p>Midnight in Nigeria.</p>
        <p>By Karl Maier.</p>
        <p>327 pp. New York:</p>

        <p>The crisis in Nigeria is as old as Nigeria itself. The giant of Africa began its life as an arbitrary federation of ethnic groups that owed its shape more to the short-lived designs of British colonialism than to the preceding centuries of local development. It was born diverse, unstable, already primed to explode.</p>
        <p>With four major ethnic groups -- the Hausa and Fulani in the north, the Yoruba in the west and the Igbo in the east, plus an almost countless number of minority tribes -- Nigeria has always had an embarrassment of human riches and possibilities. The way the state has dealt with this potential has been shameful and often bloodcurdling. During its four decades of independence from colonial rule, Nigeria has mostly known military dictatorships, drawn from the north, that took power by coup, drained petrodollars from the country, signed draconian structural-adjustment agreements with international banks and answered protests with prison and death.</p>
        <p>Yet vitality has never ceased to stream from Nigeria, often in the form of emigrants frustrated by the situation at home, and hope has been perennially attached to the troubled giant. Once, Nigeria was widely expected to become the African superpower. Now it is more often seen as the last gasp of West Africa, the region's only bulwark against the anarchy of Sierra Leone and Liberia. With the United States now training ''peacekeeping'' troops in Nigeria, the country has been stripped of its superpower cape and handed a badge, becoming a sort of beleaguered, corrupt cop on the West African beat.</p>
        <p>Why should anyone care? It's a callous but essential question, and Karl Maier attempts to answer it in ''This House Has Fallen.'' Nigeria matters, he says, because it's the United States' major trading partner in Africa and our fifth largest supplier of oil. Its dynamic body population, besides being a headache to its leaders, is a huge potential market. (A former Africa correspondent for The Independent in London, Maier puts the money first, though he also acknowledges the country's ''rich ethnic mosaic'' and even takes a detour in search of ancient sculptures.) And Nigeria should be of especial concern, he argues, because it's at the breaking point, as close to dissolving as it has been since the Biafran war ripped it apart in the late 60's.</p>
        <p>Maier promises ''to portray the most intractable crisis points'' facing the country, and, at times, he does just that, with great skill. The annulment of the 1993 election, which deprived the controversial Yoruba millionaire Moshood Abiola of the presidency and landed Gen. Sani Abacha in power instead, is recounted in a Chapter 1 page turner. But Maier does not sustain this narrative drive and focus. The second chapter is devoted to his experiences as an international observer at the 1999 elections, which were won by the current president, Olusegun Obasanjo, a former general. Although the elections helped restore a semblance of democracy to Nigeria, Maier's discussion reads not like the portrait of another crisis point but like drab pages from a reporter's diary.</p>
        <p>Maier's ambition is admirable. He has visited every region of the country, and he has interviewed some of Nigeria's most prominent figures, including Ibrahim Babangida, a former dictator who lurks in much of recent Nigerian history; Ganiyu Adams, a Yoruba lawyer and agitator; and Chief Jim Beesom Wiwa, the father of Ken Saro-Wiwa, the martyred leader of the Ogoni people who rose up in protest against Shell Oil.</p>
        <p>The list of notables goes on -- which is another problem. Maier is a top-down reporter who moves from palace to police station to bank headquarters. Very seldom does he mingle with those he calls ''the teeming, impoverished masses.'' And when your subject is a corrupt African state sliding into anarchy, much of your story will be found in the streets and the villages, where desperation is looking for an answer, or a victim. Maier doesn't go there, not for long, and so he doesn't really find his story, which is a shame. Because Maier is right: this story does matter.</p>

        <p>Correction:  October 15, 2000, Sunday  A review on Sept. 24 about ''This House Has Fallen: Midnight in Nigeria,'' by Karl Maier, misidentified a prominent Yoruba lawyer interviewed in the book. He is Gani Fewehinmi, not Ganiyu Adams.</p>
