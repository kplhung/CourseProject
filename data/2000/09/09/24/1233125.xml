        <p>AN arts organization that has been active for a hundred years deserves a party, and the New Haven Paint and Clay Club is throwing itself one in the form of a 100-work exhibition. The John Slade Ely House, where the club has been exhibiting regularly since 1961, has been spruced up for the occasion. The art is all from club's collection and many objects have also just been cleaned.</p>
        <p>An initial impression is that the show looks very fresh. The art is grouped in three distinct periods. The early period, from 1900 to 1945, is in part a reminder that landscape was an major genre before World War II, and many sturdy landscapes and seascapes possess masterly and nuanced atmospheric effects.</p>
        <p>''October Afternoon,'' painted by Samuel Franklin Hershey in 1932, features lengthening shadows in rural New England and it echos effects that Edward Hopper was mining. ''Looking East'' (1930), by Carl Lawless, contrasts faint pink clouds with an intensely blue mountain, as if Lawless had understood Matisse's freedom with color.</p>

        <p>AN arts organization that has been active for a hundred years deserves a party, and the New Haven Paint and Clay Club is throwing itself one in the form of a 100-work exhibition. The John Slade Ely House, where the club has been exhibiting regularly since 1961, has been spruced up for the occasion. The art is all from club's collection and many objects have also just been cleaned.</p>
        <p>An initial impression is that the show looks very fresh. The art is grouped in three distinct periods. The early period, from 1900 to 1945, is in part a reminder that landscape was an major genre before World War II, and many sturdy landscapes and seascapes possess masterly and nuanced atmospheric effects.</p>
        <p>''October Afternoon,'' painted by Samuel Franklin Hershey in 1932, features lengthening shadows in rural New England and it echos effects that Edward Hopper was mining. ''Looking East'' (1930), by Carl Lawless, contrasts faint pink clouds with an intensely blue mountain, as if Lawless had understood Matisse's freedom with color.</p>
        <p>A line-up of three snow scenes covers separate environments. This summer we have been treated to more than our share of cows, so it is surprising to report that a painting featuring bovines is the most captivating of the three. In ''Winter Quarters'' (1933), by Edward Charles Volkert, several cows walk toward viewers and look them in the eye. The boldness of the animals is disarming, but so is the way their white muzzles and the snow they trod on have almost the same look.</p>
        <p>Harry Leith-Ross, in a painting from 1935, emphasizes ships' masts reflected in water, and he makes the squiggly reflections into bravura abstract elements that become a main focus of the composition.</p>
        <p>''The Old Man's Son'' (1939), by Frederick Lester Sexton, is a pared-down composition of a young man dressed for foul weather at the wheel of a ship. The background is tempestuous water, and the painting's strength is in its elemental quality.</p>
        <p>One of the earliest works on exhibit is one that is hanging on the staircase all the time, John Henry Niemeyer's 1906 portrait of Dr. John Slade Ely. Dr. Ely was professor of the theory and practice of medicine at Yale University, and he built the house in 1905. The doctor has an open, humane face, one that befits an arts patron, even an accidental one. In her will, the doctor's widow, who died in 1960, said the house should become an art gallery for the city. The club had been exhibiting at the Yale School of Fine Arts and then, for 33 years, at the New Haven Free Public Library.</p>
        <p>Another early portrait is compelling for a different reason. ''Head of Rochelle,'' painted by Robert Brackman in 1935, focuses on the face of a young women who is glancing upward, deliberately away from the viewer. She seems to have been caught in a reverie. This portrait serves as a reminder of an era that was slower than the present one, and one that allowed such unapologetic self-absorption.</p>
        <p>The middle period, from 1945 to 1970, is the feeblest one, something the show's organizers must have known since there are few works representing it. Landscapes and seascapes persist, but they are more slick than heartfelt. The strongest works are sculptures, especially a blocky piece of marble that William Kent has embellished in relief with the head, wings and legs of a locust. The well-articulated work (from 1962) is evocative of pre-Columbian sculpture.</p>
        <p>Also deliberately primitive is Christine M. Purdue's alabaster ''South Wind'' (1961). The work, a head only, is surely a symbol and the artist made its hair appropriately windswept .</p>
        <p>Some work from the final years of the middle period presages a wider acknowledgment that Paint and Clay club members could be of their time. The early 70's saw some novel versions of abstraction. ''Fly By,'' by Leonard Everett Fisher, is a colorful arrangement of squares and rectangles interrupted by the pointy shapes of paper airplanes. Leo Stanton Stoutsenberger contributes an updated version of a landscape. His ''Recrementia'' (1971) is an arrangement of squares, each containing a different feature of the landscape, such as clouds, fence posts or bare tree branches. The artist might have made a sort of crazy quilt to emphasize the disconnectedness associated with modern life.</p>
        <p>The proceedings come to life again in the final period, in part because this is the most populated section and there is feeling of incessantness. Oddly it is throwbacks that are the most appealing, such as Virginia M. Burgess's ''Morning on the Avenue'' (1996), which easily recalls Hopper. A large watercolor celebrating the anatomy and the movement of a locomotive wheel by Suzanne McWhinnie is a reminder of Precisionism, the art movement that celebrated industry and technology.</p>
        <p>Many of the more recent pieces are on the small side, but with several of them a close look brings rewards. They include a complex atmospheric drawing combining pencil and watercolor by Alice Kleinman Chaikin. The three flowers limned in this work are meant to evoke music, for it is titled ''Sonatina.''</p>
        <p>Another species of organic life is investigated by Dolores M. Gall. From a distance her pastel and collage drawing might look like the earth seen from outer space, but the swirling ball is largely composed of artichokes, scissored and drawn.</p>
        <p>The New Haven Paint and Clay Club's ''100th Anniversary Exhibition'' is at the John Slade Ely House (51 Trumbull Street, New Haven) through Oct. 22.</p>
