        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>LONGING, by J. D. Landis. (Harcourt, $26.) A penetrating fictional biography of Robert Schumann, the Romantic composer who died in a madhouse in 1856 after a life of sometimes violent obsession with music and with Clara, the piano teacher's daughter who became his wife.</p>
        <p>BLOOD OF THE LIBERALS, by George Packer. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $26.) Liberalism, under one or another definition, is the force that shaped and eventually failed the author's grandfather (a congressman from Alabama), his father (a legal scholar and student of procedure) and himself (once a Peace Corps volunteer, now a writer).</p>
        <p>ARMING AMERICA: The Origins of a National Gun Culture, by Michael A. Bellesiles. (Knopf, $30.) A historian finds that far from packing old Betsy everywhere to defend their freedoms, Americans before the Civil War were averse to gun ownership; guns cost more than they were worth.</p>
        <p>NYPD: A City and Its Police, by James Lardner and Thomas Reppetto. (John Macrae/Holt, $27.50.) An absorbing, though uncomfortable, history of a famous force that has always, periodically, suffered from brutality, incompetence and corruption; and is nevertheless one of the world's best, superior in crime control, technology, detection and, of all things, the management of violence.</p>
        <p>THE LILY THEATER: A Novel of Modern China, by Lulu Wang. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $25.) A sprawling, fictionalized account of the author's own childhood during China's Cultural Revolution; a daughter of professionals sent to be re-educated in Maoism, she acquired an honest schooling from other learned inmates of the camp.</p>
        <p>THE BLACKWATER LIGHTSHIP, by Colm Toibin. (Scribner, $24.) Three generations of an Irish family are summoned to a clash of old views with new in this novel whose immediate crisis concerns a gay man's death from AIDS but which looks back to some earlier Ireland in which gay consciousness and central heating were equally unknown.</p>
        <p>THE INFORMANT: A True Story, by Kurt Eichenwald. (Broadway, $26.) The author, a reporter for The Times, makes clear and concise the complexities of the 1990's price-fixing scandal at Archer Daniels Midland, the feed makers, and the fascinating part played in the affair by a government informant whose core of truth was surrounded by a truly baroque facade of lies.</p>
        <p>COLLECTED POEMS IN ENGLISH, by Joseph Brodsky. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $30.) All the poems that appeared in English while Brodsky (1940-96), Nobel laureate, scourge of liberal pieties and embattled proponent of a formal poetics, was still alive to supervise their appearance.</p>
        <p>PROPERTIES OF LIGHT: A Novel of Love, Betrayal and Quantum Physics, by Rebecca Goldstein. (Houghton Mifflin, $23.) The author of ''The Mind-Body Problem'' explores the darker side of the conflict of ideas in physics between relativity and quantum mechanics, both of which find expressions in the structure of the novel itself.</p>
