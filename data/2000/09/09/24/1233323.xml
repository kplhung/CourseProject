        <p>ONE man's poison is another man's meat. At least that's what they say.</p>
        <p>And there is a certain logic to it. Just now, for example, some big American multinational corporations are moaning that the weak euro will crimp profits. Shouldn't it follow, then, that big companies based on the other side of the pond would see a corresponding increase in earnings when the dollars they make here are turned into cheaper euros?</p>
        <p>Maybe. But maybe not. Robert Friedman, portfolio manager of the Mutual European fund, part of Franklin Templeton Investments, took time last week to discuss the weak euro, the strong dollar and investing. Here are excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>Q.  A number of companies have said that the weakness in the euro will hamper their profitability. Are they telling the truth?</p>
        <p>A. Whether you are talking about strong dollars or weak euros, there is a difference between a transactional gain or loss and a translational gain or loss. In other words, there is a difference between something that really hurts you and an accounting translation.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola, for example, is not selling less or more soda based on what the value of the euro is. That should have a minimal impact on sales. And the cash those sales generate is probably not repatriated. But for accounting purposes it has to come back. So that is a purely translational loss.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Corrus, the old British Steel, probably has 80 percent of its business on the Continent. Now, the British pound is very weak against the dollar, but it is strong against the euro. That will really hurt them.</p>
        <p>So companies that export are going to be truly impacted by the weakness of other currencies against the dollar. On the other hand, if you are a multinational and manufacture in local markets, in my view the weakness of the currency is an excuse to cover up some fundamental problems.</p>
        <p>Q. But doesn't it follow that if American-based companies are going to book lower profits because of the euro, European companies should book higher profits because of the strong dollar?</p>
        <p>A. They will indeed report better numbers. But I would look beyond that and ask if they are telling you the business is better.</p>
        <p>Take Nestle, for example. They are a Swiss company in name only and probably don't repatriate a lot of cash. And when a consumer products company analyst looks at the company, he or she is not looking at currency fluctuations but at how unit sales are doing and how pricing per unit is doing. That will truly tell you how business is doing. The strength of the U.S. economy, not the strong dollar, is what has aided the companies that do lots of business over here.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you worry about currency fluctuations?</p>
        <p>A. We have hedged our currency positions since 1993, so I pay minimal attention to currency movements. Also, a lot of the companies we are interested in are midcap companies that tend to have localized businesses, which means they do most of their business either inside their own borders or in the euro zone.</p>
        <p>Q.  Do most mutual funds hedge currency positions? What made you start to hedge?</p>
        <p>A.  There are about 157 European funds in the United States right now, and of those I believe most do not hedge. Some may feel it is an added expense or that the fluctuations in currency values will even out over time.</p>
        <p>We started hedging based on our experience with SmithKline Beecham, a stock we bought in late 1992 and early 1993. At the time, the stock was trading at 11 times earnings, which was ridiculously cheap.</p>
        <p>It went up nicely, only to give back a huge chunk of the gain due to the strength of the dollar relative to the pound. Since then we have largely hedged currencies.</p>
        <p>Q. Has hedging helped your performance?</p>
        <p>A. We have retained our profits by hedging. But we haven't made money that way. If I thought I was going to buy a stock and hold it for 20 years, I wouldn't hedge my position, because the cost of hedging might more than evaporate the savings I might realize.</p>
        <p>Q.  What stocks are you buying now?</p>
        <p>A. About 20 percent of the European fund is in cash right now, which is higher than usual because most of the big-cap names are much too expensive at the moment.</p>
        <p>But we have been putting some money into some of the British engineering companies that have been beaten up, like Spirax. We have bought into a U.K. chemical company called Ellis &amp; Everard, as well as Cardo, a Swedish general engineering firm.</p>
        <p>Some of the Irish financial firms, like Irish Life and Anglo Irish Bank, have been beaten up. And some Spanish construction companies, like ACS and Acciona.</p>
        <p>We own a lot of French companies, like Vivendi and Total. But the only company we own in Germany is Dickerhof, a building materials company.</p>
