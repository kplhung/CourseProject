        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I cannot let the review of my book ''Ghosts of the Titanic'' (Aug. 27) pass without comment. For a start, Michael Parfit's belief that the abyssal plains are biological deserts would be correct if based on textbooks dating back 20 years. All the textbooks have been rewritten, of course. Life down there is just not obvious at first glance, because the vast majority of the organisms are smaller than an aspirin.</p>
        <p>Parfit writes that I ''actually give . . . an impression'' of being there with Robert Ballard from the beginning, planning the search for the Titanic. Parfit then goes on to state that my on-site involvement with the Titanic was restricted entirely to work with ''a salvage organization called RMS Titanic.''</p>
        <p>On the latter point he is correct. On the former, I never state that I was present for the 1985 discovery of the Titanic or the dives in 1986. I did, however, participate with Ballard directly in the Melville expedition to the Galpagos Islands, which immediately followed the September 1985 discovery of the Titanic and during which we analyzed Ballard's photographic reconnaissance of the ship. Parfit claims that I falsely paint myself as a colleague of Ballard's, yet readers of Ballard's ''Discovery of the Titanic'' will note that he cites me for my ''downblast theory.''</p>
        <p>It is true that Ballard and I went in separate directions after artifact recovery expeditions commenced in 1987. Parfit, for his part, seems sympathetic to the nonrecoverists, and it must be this that explains much of the venom in</p>
        <p>his review.</p>
