        <p>DAMIAN WOETZEL, 33,  principal dancer,  New York City Ballet</p>
        <p>Then: Age 8, 1975, in his family's backyard in Boston.</p>
        <p>''My family believed in dressing nicely for any and all occasions,'' Woetzel says. ''It seemed natural.'' Classmates ''thought we were a little bit over the top, my brother and I, taking it a bit seriously. But I guess that sort of feeds into the sense of theater.''</p>

        <p>DAMIAN WOETZEL, 33,  principal dancer,  New York City Ballet</p>
        <p>Then: Age 8, 1975, in his family's backyard in Boston.</p>
        <p>''My family believed in dressing nicely for any and all occasions,'' Woetzel says. ''It seemed natural.'' Classmates ''thought we were a little bit over the top, my brother and I, taking it a bit seriously. But I guess that sort of feeds into the sense of theater.''</p>
        <p>Now: ''There are so few occasions to get dressed up.''</p>
        <p>The Clothes: Cashmere flannel peacoat, made to order, cashmere turtleneck, $650, and wool tartan pants, made to order, Tommy Hilfiger. At Tommy Hilfiger, Beverly Hills, Calif. Grooming by Dennis Devoy for Atlantis NY.</p>
        <p>CRAIG BIERKO, 36,  actor, starring in ''The Music Man'' on Broadway</p>
        <p>Then: Age 18, 1982, at the senior prom for Blind Brook High School in Ryebrook, N.Y. His date recently resurfaced. ''She came to see the show. She still looked beautiful. And she was married and -- what can I say? -- the search continues.''</p>
        <p>Now: As Bierko has matured, so has his style. ''I've grown up despite myself. I have a couple of suits that I really like.'' But, he says, ''on my worst days, I will still pick off the top of a laundry pile if I'm in a rush.''</p>
        <p>The Clothes: Worsted wool full-dress tuxedo with silk grosgrain lapels, $4,350, and Swiss cotton pique tuxedo shirt with French cuffs, $265, Oxxford. At Bergdorf Goodman Men, by special order. Oxxford, 36 East 57th Street. Grooming by Fred van de Bunt for Nubest &amp; Company Salon, Manhasset, N.Y.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL TONG, 55,  restaurateur, Shun Lee Palace  and Shun Lee West</p>
        <p>Then: Age 41 1/2, 1949, at China's national track and field competition in Shanghai. ''My mother liked to buy clothing for me,'' he says. ''Even when I was a little boy I liked to dress up.'' And since his father was a city official, the whole family would get into the act, ''because wherever we go, people have to notice.''</p>
        <p>Now: ''I like to see beauty, pretty things -- even the food,'' Tong says. ''I never dress down. I guess it's a hobby, so usually my customers give me a compliment.''</p>
        <p>The Clothes: Suede and cashmere sweater, $795, Bergdorf Goodman Private Label. At Bergdorf Goodman Men. Pants, Tong's own, Brioni. Shoes, Johnston &amp; Murphy. Grooming by Fred van de Bunt.</p>
        <p>TINO MARTINEZ, 32,  first baseman,  New York Yankees</p>
        <p>Then: Age 9, 1976, posing for his fourth-grade picture at St. Joseph Catholic School in Tampa, Fla. ''We wore a uniform to school every day,'' he says. His boyhood preference? ''Basically a shirt and T-shirt, and you go outside and play, and that's it.''</p>
        <p>Now: His preference today? ''Easy wear'' -- a sport coat and pants, or a nice shirt and jeans. ''It depends where I'm going and what the situation is. I'm not a real flashy dresser. I'm more conservative, I guess.''</p>
        <p>The Clothes: Cashmere shirt, $850, Polo by Ralph Lauren. At Barneys New York. Polo Ralph Lauren, selected stores nation-wide. Pants, property of George Steinbrenner and the New York Yankees. Belt, Martinez's own. Air Slam MCS cleats, Nike. Grooming by Fred van de Bunt.</p>
        <p>BOBBY SHORT, 76,  cabaret performer</p>
        <p>Then: Age 9, 1934, with his dog, Pal, outside his family's home in Danville, Ill. (His pal these days is Chili, below.) ''We were all very, very much affected by what grown-ups wore, and a little boy longed for the chance to wear long trousers, to dress up like his daddy dressed or like his big brothers.''</p>
        <p>Now: ''I suppose by today's standards I am somewhat conservative, except that I like to play around with clothing and mix and match. I like jeans. But on the other hand, my tailoring is all bespoke, and a good shirt and tie suits me just fine.''</p>
        <p>The Clothes: Merino-blend cardigan, $480, over long-sleeve wool sweater, $245, and corduroy knickers, from a past season, Holland &amp; Holland. Sweaters at Holland &amp; Holland, 50 East 57th Street. Knickers, in the fall collection, at Saks Fifth Avenue. Shirt, Short's own. Socks, Holland &amp; Holland. Shoes, Johnston &amp; Murphy. Grooming by Fred van de Bunt. Set design by Jill Nicholls at Magnet NY.</p>
