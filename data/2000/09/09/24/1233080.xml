        <p>When asked to describe ''Lifegame,'' the newest import from the Improbable Theater in London, the show's creators tend to use words like unfinished, imperfect and, most commonly, scary.</p>
        <p>''It's terrifying,'' said Lee Simpson, a performer and co-director. ''It is, without a doubt, the show that remains the most frightening of all.''</p>
        <p>Why? Well, every night, the troupe takes a ''guest,'' preselected from a group of volunteers and not (producers stress) a member of the audience, and gently quiz them about the important events of their lives. Then, from whatever the guest tells them, the seven-person troupe makes theater about that guest's life. On the spot. For two hours. In front of a paying audience.</p>
        <p>On top of that, the actual dramatic methodology also changes from night to night. Sometimes the troupe might act out a guest's first kiss with puppets; other times the guests might actually play themselves in a scene. Sometimes, the guest literally plays God talking to an actor playing the guest. (Confused?)</p>
        <p>In short, no show is ever the same. ''There's a point before we go on where we say: 'Is this actually a show? Is this going to be of any interest to anyone?' '' Mr. Simpson said with a laugh. ''And there's no clue because the protagonist isn't there yet.''</p>
        <p>For all of its actors' trepidation, ''Lifegame,'' which opens at the Jane Street Theater on Thursday, comes to New York having wowed audiences in London in 1998, and more recently, having sold out a five-week run at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego over the summer. In both incarnations, the show was also praised in reviews, including the one in The Los Angeles Times, which described ''Lifegame'' as ''an ingenious twist on improvisational theater.''</p>
        <p>That ''Lifegame'' comes from the Improbable Theater is not a complete surprise, considering the company's history of spooky and ecclectic work, including ''70 Hill Lane,'' a 1998 play that dealt with a pesky poltergeist. Two of the group's artistic directors, Mr. Simpson and Phelim McDermott, also directed last year's ''Shockheaded Peter,'' a hilariously subversive puppet show featuring death, dismemberment and the world's creepiest sideshow barker.</p>
        <p>''Lifegame'' grew out of an exercise developed by Keith Johnstone, the founder of the Royal Court Theater in London and an expert in improvisation (or ''impro,'' as the Brits call it).</p>
        <p>In 1986, Mr. McDermott took part in a workshop with Mr. Johnstone in Dorsett, England. He was surprised, he said, at the effect of the exercise on the actors and  the small audience of workshop participants.</p>
        <p>''It was impro, but it was things that were really memorable,'' Mr. McDermott said. So memorable, in fact, that Mr. McDermott said he was committed to doing the show for a larger audience, though not in the type of surroundings usually equated with improvisational theater. ''I wanted to do it as a proper theater show, rather than on the second floor of a pub,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, much of the challenge of ''Lifegame'' has been avoiding the pitfalls associated with improv, including treacle or easy laughs.</p>
        <p>''The worst thing in the world is seeing people improvise and thinking they're being really meaningful,'' said Mr. Simpson. ''It's just silly.''</p>
        <p>And mindful of improv's lightweight image, producers have also made a point of calling the piece ''spontaneous theater.''</p>
        <p>At a recent preview, the volunteer was Alisa Kwitney, a novelist and editor from the Upper West Side who watched as the seven-member troupe glided through re-enactments of her mother's early hippy days (incense, bongos), of Ms. Kwitney's  first love (heartbreaking, of course), and even of her imagined death (a shark was involved).</p>
        <p>Afterward, the troupe hung out at the theater's bar, chatting with about three-dozen audience members, many of whom spontaneously offered up their own life stories. It is a phenonmenon Mr. McDermott says is both common -- and fascinating.</p>
        <p>''It's funny, it really stops you from seeing people in a certain way,'' he said. ''After you've done the show, you walk down the street and you see people's faces, and it's like a lens or something. You just see all these stories.''</p>
        <p>THEATER  Correction:  October 15, 2000, Sunday  An article on Sept. 24 about the performance work ''Lifegame'' referred incorrectly to Keith Johnstone, who developed the improvisational exercise on which the show is based. He was not the founder of the Royal Court Theater in London; George Devine was.</p>
