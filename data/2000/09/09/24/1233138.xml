        <p>Westport Awards</p>
        <p>Each year about this time Westport honors a group of artists, writers, actors, musicians and photographers who have lived or worked in the town during the course of their careers.</p>
        <p>The seventh annual public awards presentation will be held today at 2 p.m. in the Westport Town Hall, 110 Myrtle Avenue.</p>
        <p>On the list of living recipients is the composer and musician Norman Dello Joio; the actress Haila Stoddard; Max Wilk, the writer, producer and teacher; and George Silk, the photographer.</p>
        <p>Posthumous recognition will be given to Lucille Lortel, one of the theater's most dedicated advocates and producers; the artist Kerr Eby; the musician Heida Hermann; and the children's writer P. D. Eastman.</p>
        <p>A short video presentation will precede the awards ceremonies and a performance of a Dello Joio work will end the program, followed by a reception at the Westport Historical Society.</p>
        <p>The event is open to the public free of charge.</p>
        <p>Appraising Collectibles</p>
        <p>You did save those Pez dispensers, and some of that Silly Putty you used to have, didn't you? Your mother's tin school lunch box? All manner of junk might now be worth the price of at least one pair of Manolo Blahniks.</p>
        <p>Pack up one prized thing and take it to the Connnecticut Historical Society in Hartford on Wednesday at 7 p.m., when Gary Sohmers, an appraiser for the ''Antiques Roadshow'' television show, will tell you its worth.</p>
        <p>During his lecture on ''What's Hot, What's Not,'' Mr. Sohmers will offer sage advice on the collectibles craze and where you might find a fortune among the detritus in the attic, basement and garage.</p>
        <p>The society is at 1 Elizabeth Street, and admission is $5, $5 for people over 64 and children 6 through 17 years of age. The number to call for more information is (860) 236-5621.</p>
        <p>Mark Twain</p>
        <p>It took Samuel Clemens seven years to write ''Huckleberry Finn'' with the help of his wife, Olivia, only to face scorn and verbal abuse from many quarters when it was published. The public library in Concord, Mass., for example, called it trash and refused to have the book on its shelves. To which the author's response was, ''that will sell 25,000 copies for sure.''</p>
        <p>All this will be brought to life in a program of dramatic readings on Thursday at 7 in the Carriage House of Samuel and Olivia Langdon Clemens' Hartford home, now a museum, at 351 Farmington Avenue.</p>
        <p>''Mark My Words: Twain and the Creative Process'' will be performed by the actors John Pogson and Lisa Steier as the 19th-century writer and and his wife. The material was gleaned from the couple's personal correspondence and private papers.</p>
        <p>The book remains among the top five titles on the ''100 Most Challenged Books 1990-1999,'' a list compiled by the American Library Association. ''Mark My Words'' has been appropriately scheduled during the association's 16th annual Banned Book Week. Admission is $10. The number to call for reservations or more information is (860) 247-0998, extension 23, or charge reservations to Visa or MasterCard by e-mailing rachel</p>
