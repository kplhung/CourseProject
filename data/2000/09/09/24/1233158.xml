        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I gladly share Philip Leider's sentiment, expressed in his interview with Amy Newman [''An Art World Figure Re-emerges, Unrepentant,'' Sept. 3], that there are Israeli artists ''as good as any similar group in the world.'' I share less his sentiment regarding ''security'' issues being an obstacle to international exposure of Israeli art. Indeed, unfortunately, for many years the focus on the Middle East conflict has diverted attention from Israel's remarkably vibrant cultural life and its intense creative scene. A need for extra security at venues was not the reason for the modest presence of Israeli art outside Israel. (Hamas and Hezbollah don't reveal great interest in the consumption of art and culture.) The challenge has always been to bring the attention of the ''decision makers'' to the ''periphery.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I gladly share Philip Leider's sentiment, expressed in his interview with Amy Newman [''An Art World Figure Re-emerges, Unrepentant,'' Sept. 3], that there are Israeli artists ''as good as any similar group in the world.'' I share less his sentiment regarding ''security'' issues being an obstacle to international exposure of Israeli art. Indeed, unfortunately, for many years the focus on the Middle East conflict has diverted attention from Israel's remarkably vibrant cultural life and its intense creative scene. A need for extra security at venues was not the reason for the modest presence of Israeli art outside Israel. (Hamas and Hezbollah don't reveal great interest in the consumption of art and culture.) The challenge has always been to bring the attention of the ''decision makers'' to the ''periphery.''</p>
        <p>And this challenge is being met. A group exhibition of contemporary Israeli art, ''Desert Cliche,'' was presented at venues including the Grey Art Gallery in New York in 1997 and 1998. The following year the Jewish Museum in New York presented ''After Rabin,'' which featured works created by Israeli artists in the period following Prime Minister Rabin's assassination. Exhibitions such as these, as well as the participation of Israeli artists in the Venice Biennale, Documenta and similar events, generate increased interest and visits by curators and art dealers to Israel.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 9, Artists Space opened its fall schedule by dedicating all four of its galleries to the Israeli artist Uri Tzaig. The coming season, despite Mr. Leider's trepidation regarding sudden acclaim, will feature Israeli artists at P.S. 1, Deitch Projects, the Whitney and Art in General, to mention just a few.</p>
