        <p>BRIX in Cheshire inhabits the space (with the same ownership and chef) that once housed the Pavilion, but the proprietors Onella and Bernard Gayraud (he is also the chef) have changed the cuisine, menu and decor dramatically, evoking a more casual Mediterranean image, which seems to have taken hold very nicely. With good reason. The bright, stylishly mustard walls, parquet floor, Windsor-style chairs, banquettes and booths are a simple backdrop for some delicious, fresh-tasting food on a menu that also features a few pastas and pizzas.</p>
        <p>We were optimistic from the moment the aromatic Liuzzi Italian extra-virgin olive oil was poured in individual saucers, served along with a basket of wholesome whole wheat bread.</p>

        <p>BRIX in Cheshire inhabits the space (with the same ownership and chef) that once housed the Pavilion, but the proprietors Onella and Bernard Gayraud (he is also the chef) have changed the cuisine, menu and decor dramatically, evoking a more casual Mediterranean image, which seems to have taken hold very nicely. With good reason. The bright, stylishly mustard walls, parquet floor, Windsor-style chairs, banquettes and booths are a simple backdrop for some delicious, fresh-tasting food on a menu that also features a few pastas and pizzas.</p>
        <p>We were optimistic from the moment the aromatic Liuzzi Italian extra-virgin olive oil was poured in individual saucers, served along with a basket of wholesome whole wheat bread.</p>
        <p>Our high hopes for the rest of the meal quickly accelerated when our appetizers arrived. A big plate of ethereal house-made gnocchi al telefono (with thin strands of mozzarella, melted to resemble telephone wires, hence the name) was enveloped by and contrasted happily with a garlicky fresh tomato pesto. Delicious as this earthy dish was, there was enough of it to qualify as a main course, making the thought of an entree daunting. Sauteed sea scallops, also a hefty portion, were fat, juicy and golden-browned. They came with braised Belgian endive, red and yellow sweet pepper strips in a pleasing sweet-tangy thyme sauce, tantalized with lemon, a pinch of sugar and endive broth.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, our entree servings were even more generous than the starters, too much for a normal appetite to handle at one sitting. We did as much justice as possible to a humongous serving of osso buco Milanese, but fell short. Yet the dish was much too zesty to discard. The solution: a doggy bag and dinner the next day, thus making two meals out of the tastiest osso buco we have enjoyed in ages. The veal was falling-off-the-shank-tender and the robust sauce, made with tomatoes, onions, celery, carrots, bay leaves and veal broth, was so succulent we scooped some on to our garlic mashed potatoes (which we requested as a substitute for the saffron rice that normally accompanied the veal).</p>
        <p>Maple Leaves duck breast was an avalanche of tender slices, enhanced by a sweet-tart dried plum and apple sauce, along with an unusually flavorful mixture of wild and white rice. Two individual-sized pizzas also made appleaing entrees. Both pizza Popeye, a congenial assemblage of spinach, ricotta, caramelized onion and black olives, and pizza Margherita, a pairing of fresh tomato, mozzarella, herbs and Parmesan, were oven-hot and fresh-tasting, though the thin crust was more cake-like than the crust of a brick-oven-fired pie.</p>
        <p>At both lunch and dinner, desserts, obviously house-made, almost stole the show.</p>
        <p>A standout was the incredibly rich chocolate mousse cake, served with a dollop of fresh-made whipped cream. A close cousin was chocolate raspberry mousse cake, floating in a sea of creme anglaise. Strawberry shortcake in a cake dotted with poppy seeds was a modern take on an old-fashioned favorite. Even the cake-like slice of tiramisu, with embroideries of chocolate sauce, was  rich and satisfying, proving that a creative chef can revive even such a cliched number as this.</p>
        <p>Along with freshly made and satisfying dishes, Brix boasts abundant servings and moderate prices. Dinner for two, three courses each, costs  $57, before tax, tip or drinks.</p>
        <p>The name Brix connotes a method used for measuring the sugar content of grapes. This might suggest an ample repertory of wines. But the reality is a medium-small, well-priced list of wines from California, Italy and Frence, beginning at $18. There are also some satisfying microbrewery beers available.</p>
        <p>Brix is neither fancy nor pretentious, but provides freshly made dishes in a part of the state where culinary creativity should be very welcome.</p>
