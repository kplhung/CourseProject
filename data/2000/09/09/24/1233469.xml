        <p>Robert W. Ray, the independent prosecutor, ended a six-year, almost $60 million investigation by delivering a report that cleared both President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, of criminal wrongdoing in connection with the Whitewater real estate deal.</p>
        <p>The failed Arkansas real estate venture was the beginning of an inquiry that broadened into wholly unexpected areas, including Mr. Clinton's relationship with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky, which led to the impeachment drama in Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray's conclusion was that there was insufficient evidence ''to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt'' that Mr. or Mrs. Clinton committed any crimes, though Mr. Clinton could still be indicted after leaving office over his sworn statements in connection with his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.</p>
