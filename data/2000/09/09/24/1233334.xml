        <p>China's imminent entry into the World Trade Organization, made possible by the agreement we negotiated to open its markets and Congress's passage of permanent normal trade relations, can be the most important development in our relationship with that country since we normalized ties in 1979.</p>
        <p>The most immediate benefits will be economic. Chinese tariffs from telecommunications to autos to agriculture will fall by half or more. We will be better able to sell and distribute American-made goods in China without relocating our factories, or selling through the Chinese government, or transferring technology. In return, we have agreed only to maintain the access China already enjoys to our market.</p>

        <p>China's imminent entry into the World Trade Organization, made possible by the agreement we negotiated to open its markets and Congress's passage of permanent normal trade relations, can be the most important development in our relationship with that country since we normalized ties in 1979.</p>
        <p>The most immediate benefits will be economic. Chinese tariffs from telecommunications to autos to agriculture will fall by half or more. We will be better able to sell and distribute American-made goods in China without relocating our factories, or selling through the Chinese government, or transferring technology. In return, we have agreed only to maintain the access China already enjoys to our market.</p>
        <p>But if we viewed the passage of permanent normal trade relations solely as an economic opportunity, we would be missing the main point. At stake is how China evolves over a decade or more. Will it resist globalization, or harness it to meet human needs? Will it reject popular demands for more freedom and accountability, or achieve the stability that comes only from letting people shape their own lives? Will it disregard global rules, or work within them?</p>
        <p>Trade with China will not automatically bring freedom or peace. But opening China's markets can influence the choices it is making at this important moment in its history.</p>
        <p>In the last 20 years, China has established the right to own property and lifted more than 200 million people from poverty. Yet the state still dominates China's economy. Environmental damage is hurting the quality of life and economic growth. Some 800 million Chinese still live off the land; many millions want to migrate to cities, where unemployment already is high.</p>
        <p>Hard-liners in China opposed W.T.O. membership because China's closed economic system reinforces their political control. More reform-minded leaders understand that in a global economy, the system must become more open and competitive -- that despite political risks, this is the only way for China to meet its mounting challenges and avoid internal upheaval and disintegration.</p>
        <p>In other words, there is a debate under way in China, as elsewhere, about how to adapt to globalization. We have a stake in the course China chooses. Membership in the W.T.O. puts China on a course that will diminish the role of government in its economy and its people's lives, while bringing China into an international system of rules and responsibilities.</p>
        <p>As tariffs fall, competition will speed the dismantling of China's state enterprises, meaning that tens of millions of Chinese citizens will no longer depend on the government for everything from their paycheck to their housing to their health care. There will also be tensions -- more short-term unemployment, labor and political activism -- and China's leaders will face hard political choices. We don't know how they will choose when the moment of truth arrives. But there will be great pressure to accommodate popular demands, by expanding local elections, letting workers take grievances to court, and broadening outlets for dissent.</p>
        <p>Open markets will also accelerate the information revolution in China. In the past year, the number of Internet addresses in China has more than quadrupled to nine million. This year, the number is expected to grow to more than 20 million. China's effort to restrict access to some Web sites only proves how these changes threaten the status quo.</p>
        <p>By agreeing with us on its terms of entry into the W.T.O., China has chosen to work within the international system. By enacting permanent normal trade relations, we have validated that choice, bolstering leaders who favor cooperation, taking an emotional issue away from hard-liners who seek to stoke anti-American nationalism. We still have significant differences with China, but through engagement we have a better mechanism to resolve them. This includes working toward a peaceful resolution of tensions between China and Taiwan. Taiwan will join the W.T.O. immediately after China. Their economic ties will deepen further, and so will the costs of confrontation.</p>
        <p>To seize these opportunities, we must clearly understand our interests in China's future. We do not want to see a strong China that seeks confrontation. Nor do we want to see a weak China, beset by internal conflicts and social dislocation, becoming a vast zone of instability in Asia. Ironically, the one sure path to stability for China, as for any nation in this global age, lies in change: in liberating the potential of its people economically and politically, and reducing barriers to international cooperation. We must encourage China to see its success in those terms. How can we do that?</p>
        <p>First, China must make enormous changes to meet its W.T.O. obligations -- restructuring industries, publishing long-secret laws and regulations, establishing formal procedures to adjudicate disputes, and leveling the playing field for foreign companies. It has asked us for help in building the expertise to make these changes, developing its legal system, and in addressing its devastating environmental problems. It is in our interest to provide it.</p>
        <p>Second, we should continue to bring China into international regimes and institutions that set global rules. China has been more willing to adjust its conduct to meet international standards it has freely embraced than to respond to unilateral demands. For example, it has joined the Nonproliferation Treaty, the Chemical and Biological Weapons Conventions, and has strengthened its export controls in accordance with each. We are encouraging it to join the global regime that limits the transfer of missile technology, and to ratify the international human rights treaties it has signed.</p>
        <p>That is not a substitute for direct efforts to press China on the transfer of dangerous technology, or peaceful resolution of differences with Taiwan.  And America must continue to support from the outside the struggle for human rights on the inside -- as we have by sponsoring resolutions at the United Nations Human Rights Commission and by shining the spotlight on violations of religious freedom -- as we will by working with the new commission Congress has established to monitor China's progress on human rights. But we will be even more effective if we act in concert with others in the context of international rules.</p>
        <p>Finally, we must maintain our military presence and our alliances in Asia. There remain enough uncertainties that we must be ready if there is a crisis. If tensions between North and South Korea decrease and if China continues to open up, we may be tempted to draw back. We must not do so. For we are not in Asia simply to respond to danger, but to be a balance wheel for stability that prevents danger from arising. We can play that role even better if adoption of P.N.T.R. and China's entry into the W.T.O. reduces mutual suspicion, while accelerating the pace of constructive change in China.</p>
        <p>Of course, that is only an opportunity, not a guarantee. We cannot control the choices China makes. But we do have control over what we do. With permanent normal trade relations, we have made the right choice, to extend our hand rather than merely clenching our fist. Now we must build on it. The 21st century world will be a far better place with China moving in the right direction.</p>
