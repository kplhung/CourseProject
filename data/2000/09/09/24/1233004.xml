        <p>UPDIKE</p>
        <p>America's Man of Letters.</p>
        <p>By William H. Pritchard.</p>
        <p>351 pp. South Royalton, Vt.:</p>
        <p>Steerforth Press. $27.</p>
        <p>Back in the universally exciting 60's, before soccer moms and the advent of the home gymnasium, there used to be sex in the suburbs as well as in the city and the White House. In those years its greatest chronicler was John Updike, and ''Couples,'' his novel of small-town Massachusetts key parties and wife-swapping, made its author a hot million. In April 1968, William H. Pritchard reminds us in this somewhat old-fashioned and for that reason rather endearing critical appraisal of Updike's massive oeuvre, the novelist was featured on the cover of Time magazine, accompanied by the headline ''The Adulterous Society.''</p>
        <p>Updike's reputation as a racy author never peaked in this way again, as we know, although he continued to plot the confusions of desire and their ensuing sexual calamities and abrasions among middle-class white folk on the Eastern Seaboard and in Pennsylvania. In ''Rabbit at Rest,'' Updike's brilliant conclusion to his Rabbit Angstrom tetralogy, begun in 1960 and finished a decade ago, Harry Angstrom, now 56 and all fired up on his first day home from the hospital after angioplasty, cuckolds his cokehead son, Nelson, by sleeping with Pru, his daughter-in-law. ''For some readers,'' Pritchard remarks, ''the event is simply too much to take,'' although at the time we didn't hear a peep from the likes of Messrs. Lieberman and Bennett (perhaps Rabbit's subsequent purgatorial drive from Pennsylvania to Florida silenced would-be critics), and Time that year had nothing to say about the incestuous society.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, while happily we still hear a lot from the unflaggingly prolific Updike, we're more likely to hear about him in discussions that focus on a changing of the literary guard, or the declining sales and abilities of senior big-name male authors. Pritchard opens his book by quoting from an assault that was launched on Updike, Bellow, Roth and Mailer in the fall of 1997 by the novelist David Foster Wallace and the critic Sven Birkerts in The New York Observer under the heading ''Twilight of the Phallocrats.'' According to Wallace, Updike in particular is guilty of ''radical self-absorption'' and ''uncritical celebration of this self-absorption'' both in his self and in his characters. Pritchard wants to reverse this judgment, or at least to appeal the case on the grounds that Updike's self-absorption is both a ''mark of aesthetic power'' and the sine qua non for ''book after book full of artistic, human satisfaction.'' To this end Pritchard offers a critical appreciation of Updike's work, taking us more or less chronologically through his poetry, fiction, memoirs and literary criticism, and neglecting only Updike's writing on art as beyond the scope of the book.</p>
        <p>The first thing to be noted is that William Pritchard is a modest guy. In his introduction he not only announces that he ''would be pleased'' if his readers ''were moved to put down my book and substitute for it one of the subject's stories or poems'' but also recommends Nicholson Baker's remarkable tale of obsession and literary envy, ''U and I,'' as the best book on Updike that has appeared. It's hard to imagine a culture-clued, or theory-laden, or identity-politics-fueled, baby boom or Generation X academic diverting attention so graciously from his or her own work (Pritchard, like Updike, was born in 1932). The contemporary push is for the critic to establish him or herself as a supreme, confident arbiter of the zeitgeist, in the manner of Camille Paglia or Marjorie Garber. On the other hand, Pritchard is right to be modest about his own achievement. His book, certainly when compared with any of Updike's or with ''U and I,'' or even with his own literary biography of Robert Frost, is a little flat: a perfectly adequate collection of descriptions, judgments, biographical snippets and occasionally delightful insights (''Food as an irresistible poison is related to the sense of doom that keeps descending on Harry''), useful for students of Updike to dip into but hardly a book to excite the general reader. However, it does seem significant in this regard that Pritchard's publisher is the innovative Steerforth Press (which brought back Dawn Powell) and not a university press, as one might have expected. This may signal an interesting shift in who publishes what. ''Updike: America's Man of Letters'' will test where, outside a vastly altered academic market, an audience might be found for Pritchard's type of thoughtful but not exactly au courant critical study.</p>
        <p>PRITCHARD is at his best when countering the familiar knock on Updike that he owns a bejeweled style but has ''nothing to say.'' This criticism, patently absurd to anyone who has read even a handful of Updike's more than 40 books, nevertheless has been made so often that it is worth Pritchard's long rebuttal. The problem is that, geared up to praise, Pritchard sometimes goes too far in his enthusiasm, and this leads him astray. For example, he vastly overstates the case for Updike's poetry. His comment on Updike's ''Beautiful Bowel Movement,'' in which the poet celebrates his excretion of a ''flawless coil,'' runs as follows: ''I know no better instance of an artist's belief that form counts, that everything natural has its ideal or spiritual fulfillment.'' Hmm. John Updike's extraordinary output of criticism and reviews, and his willingness to take on a vast array of authors and subjects, once led Martin Amis to refer to him as ''Iron John.'' Pritchard's take on Updike as ''indefatigable reviewer'' is to point out his unusual generosity, especially in a culture that seems to crave and enjoy seeing people bashed. This is undoubtedly true, and Updike has been particularly brave and generous in assessing his peers, including Roth and Bellow, without writing an advertisement for himself.</p>
        <p>All in all, Pritchard's book is a gentle and intelligent request for a little more thought and a little less cranky let's-move-on speed in judging the work of one of America's pre-eminent writers. He makes a solid case, although I wish he had gone a little deeper into the psychological peculiarities of the Bech books and what is perhaps Updike's greatest act of generosity: his awarding of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Literature to Henry Bech.</p>
