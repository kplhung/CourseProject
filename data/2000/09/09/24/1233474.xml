        <p>When he was appointed the top antitrust cop at the Justice Department, Joel Klein was sharply criticized for being too soft, particularly on telecommunications mergers.</p>
        <p>''We've got an antitrust fellow here who rolls over and plays dead,'' Senator Ernest Hollings said at the time.</p>
        <p>Bill Gates would probably disagree.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein has now announced his intention to resign, after compiling a formidable prosecutorial record that included the order to break up the Microsoft Corporation, the dissolution of a global vitamin cartel and the compilation of a list of proposed corporate mergers that were abandoned or restructured after the government's antitrust objections.</p>
