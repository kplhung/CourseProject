        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''What Local Control?'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 19), Leon Botstein argues for national education. I agree with his conclusion, but not some of his reasons. He says that under local control, children frequently end up the victims of voters frustrated ''over their own powerlessness in other aspects of politics.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''What Local Control?'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 19), Leon Botstein argues for national education. I agree with his conclusion, but not some of his reasons. He says that under local control, children frequently end up the victims of voters frustrated ''over their own powerlessness in other aspects of politics.''</p>
        <p>Our schools arise from an enduring coherence in educational theory promulgated by a small group of education schools, notably Harvard's and Columbia's, and put into effect by nationally organized teachers who lobby at every level of government. There is no effective countervailing force.</p>
        <p>The theoreticians and the practitioners work nationally, but school boards and parents work locally. Most parents can be involved only part time and only during the years their children attend school.</p>
        <p>National education is the right idea, but only if it can counterbalance the forces that have produced our current system.</p>
