        <p>President Clinton said today during a visit to a bookstore that he had read books about his impeachment but did not plan to write one of his own.</p>
        <p>He stopped at Willow Glen Books during a fund-raising visit to the San Jose area and saw a display featuring ''The Breach,'' an account of the impeachment by Peter Baker, a reporter for The Washington Post. But Mr. Clinton said that he did not plan to buy it or read it.</p>
        <p>When asked by reporters, Mr. Clinton said that he had read and liked two books about the impeachment -- ''The Hunting of the President,'' by Joe Conason and Gene Lyons, and ''A Vast Conspiracy,'' by Jeffrey Toobin. Both are sympathetic to his position.</p>
        <p>President Clinton did buy two books in the shop, ''The Bear and the Dragon,'' by Tom Clancy and ''Spirit Matters,'' by Michael Lerner.</p>
