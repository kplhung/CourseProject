        <p>THE DIAGNOSIS</p>
        <p>By Alan Lightman.</p>
        <p>369 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Pantheon Books. $25.</p>
        <p>Bill Chalmers, the protagonist of Alan Lightman's strong new novel, works in a Boston high-rise in a high-pressure job that involves the processing of ''all kinds of information. It's mostly business information. Not all.'' As a junior partner, he is a man in a hurry and therefore entirely dependent on cell phones, pagers, computers and the Internet. Paradoxically, these time-saving devices leave him with so little family time that he communicates with his only son, Alexander, largely by e-mail. Alexander is a precocious adolescent so weaned on the Net that his fingers jump like ''minnows over his keyboard.'' Chalmers's wife, Melissa, meets her needs for intimacy in a virtual affair in a chat room. The family is not just wired; its dialogue and consciousness, and so a good part of its manifest existence, take place in cyberspace.</p>
        <p>We first encounter Chalmers running for the subway, having calculated to the minute how long it will take him to get through the turnstile and onto the platform. The sight of a woman speaking on a cellular phone, ''a new model, considerably smaller and sleeker than his,'' prompts him to check his voice mail. As he does, his eye is caught by a digital display promising ''stock quotations on your pager, minute by minute'' and he tries to copy down the Web address before it disappears. He finds that he has three unplayed messages but can't retrieve them because the system is down. Suddenly, he's faced with a problem far more serious: he forgets who he is and where he is going. His briefcase might hold clues to his identity, but he has lost it. Paralyzed with fear, he rides until the police come for him; he has disrobed and is curled up in a fetal position, desperately clasping his cell phone.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Chalmers, his memory returns in a day. He is left with tingling and numbness in his limbs as well as anxiety because he is hopelessly behind at work. He knows his company cares much more about his productivity than his health.</p>
        <p>''&gt;&gt;&gt; MAIL 50.02.04</p>
        <p>Just when the reader's vicarious anxiety for Chalmers reaches an intolerable level, there is a radical shift in the story. Alexander has signed up for a ''really cool college course'' on the Internet on Plato. As he e-mails his dad: ''It costs $90, but yotu don;t have tot pay for the whole thing if you don't do the whole thing. . . . Mom saidd to ask you. I don't have anything else to do today.''</p>
        <p>Alexander breaks the copy-protect lock and downloads the entire course and sends it to his father. So it is, in chapters interspersed between the main narrative, that we find ourselves in Athens in 399 B.C. as the city braces itself for the execution of Socrates. Anytus, a wealthy tanner fearful of Socrates' ideas and responsible for prosecuting him, is in a bind because Socrates refuses exile and instead insists on accepting the alternative: death by ingestion of hemlock. Anytus, who does not want this on his conscience, decides to hire an assassin, who is mysteriously murdered just when he is about to kill Socrates.</p>
        <p>Back in Boston, Chalmers visits a Dr. Petrov. In the waiting room another patient tells him: ''On my last visit, a month ago Tuesday, Dr. Petrov hinted to me that he might be ready to proceed to a provisional diagnosis, also called the diagnosis pro tem. But then, just when I was leaving his office, he ordered another group of tests. . . . I once heard that when Petrov was a young physician, years ago, he occasionally made definite diagnoses, and these were often quite correct. But with the vast increase in medical technology, and with it so many new considerations to take into account, he's limited himself.''</p>
        <p>Petrov, when he finally sees Chalmers and is pressed for a diagnosis, says: ''Please, Mr. Chalmers. I would only be speculating. There is so much to learn. We should now just be gathering information and ruling things out. Your eyes are a bit glassy. You have numbness. It could be any number of things.'' Petrov refers him to specialists in neurology, plasmapheresis and psychiatry and orders a laundry list of tests. Petrov e-mails him: ''Your myleogram is back, and I see nothing askew int he reslts. We have a number of options. There is good informatin to be gained by abiopsy, although this is an invasive procedure and contains some risk. . . . There is no reason to come in to my office. I look forward to hearing from you by e-mail, which is the best way to reach me. In the meanwhlke, I atach an intersteing article from Brain.''</p>
        <p>The mysterious illness progresses relentlessly, and Chalmers is soon fired. Melissa, busy remodeling the house and keeping up with the Joneses, is less than sympathetic. ''You're throwing everything away. Everything we've worked for. Your job, your health, our family. We'll lose the house. I don't know what will happen to us. Don't you get it, Bill? It's all in your head. . . . You just can't hack it, so you're self-destructing.'' As Chalmers grows weaker and becomes dependent on a wheelchair, Alex and Melissa take to reading him the last installments of the Internet course. He hears that Socrates, on his deathbed, said: ''Death is only the separation of the soul from the body. After that the soul is pure and free. . . . Men who fear death love the body, and probably power and money as well.''</p>
        <p>Lightman, a lecturer in physics and a professor of humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the author of the delightful novel ''Einstein's Dreams.'' Both there and here, he reveals himself to be a highly original and imaginative thinker. We realize with some alarm that Chalmers's world is not that far removed from our own, except that in Chalmers's case the technological excess has caused a mysterious disease. Neither the story of Chalmers's decline nor the Socrates story comes to a satisfying resolution. This is perhaps Lightman's intent: that we should weave the two strands together and come up with a manifesto, an interpretation of Socrates in the context of our modern world. If you put vanity or the accumulation of material possessions before care of your soul (Socrates and Lightman seem to say), you risk ruining your life. Or perhaps Lightman meant simply to write a novel that forcefully captures the great confluence of our times: information overload, unimaginable prosperity and spiritual bankruptcy. In either case, he has succeeded.</p>
