        <p>The top financial officials of the United States, fresh from an unprecedented synchronized plunge into world oil and currency markets, joined other rich nations today in vowing to fight what they described as double jeopardy for the global economy.</p>
        <p>In a communique issued after Group of 7 financial leaders met here, ministers said they would monitor currency markets to see whether they needed to follow Friday's coordinated central bank action to shore up the euro, Europe's battered common currency, with further interventions. But they used stronger language on oil prices, saying it was ''crucial for the world economy'' that oil-producing nations take steps to reduce prices, which have tripled since early 1999.</p>
        <p>''Oil prices are the largest dark cloud in the blue sky of the global economy,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said after the Group of 7 meetings, speaking of a recent run-up in the price of crude oil to a 10-year high of more than $30 a barrel. ''Prices need to return to a more historical range.''</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration's decision on Friday to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help dampen oil prices won praise in the communique. Other Group of 7 nations are considering releasing oil from their reserves, and ministers discussed ways of breaking oil distribution bottlenecks and ways of putting diplomatic pressure on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, officials said in describing the talks.</p>
        <p>The attempts to correct currency and oil prices cast the United States, which often argues that such markets should take care of themselves, as an aggressive interventionist, evoking expressions of surprise from other Group of 7 ministers. Several said Friday's concerted buying of euros and selling of dollars, yen and other currencies had gone smoothly, though some traders expressed doubts that the American, British, European, Canadian and Japanese central banks would continue to do whatever it took to push the euro up against the dollar if sentiment turned negative again. ''It was surprising how well the action went,'' said Germany's finance minister, Hans Eichel. ''Especially before the U.S. election, it was surprising the U.S. even participated.''</p>
        <p>The high-level talks on how best to corral market prices underscored how officials had come to view the euro's weakness and oil's strength as major inflationary threats that pose an immediate and largely unanticipated danger to global growth, which according to recent forecasts was keeping the fastest annual pace in more than a decade.</p>
        <p>Broad political considerations also played a role. The relentless decline of the euro challenged the concept of European integration generally, especially as Denmark prepares to vote on Thursday on whether to join the euro zone.</p>
        <p>Longer term, Europe faces a paradox: Its drive to expand both the geographical and political reach of the European Union depends in good measure on the euro, the showpiece of the region's economic common interest. But currency traders increasingly lost faith in the euro, European Central Bank officials argued to their Group of 7 counterparts, because they saw insufficient political weight behind the currency, which was introduced 21 months ago.</p>
        <p>American officials largely accepted those arguments when discussing whether to join the European Central Bank in defending the currency in the open market, a decision that Mr. Summers and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, made in the middle of last week. It was the first such intervention the United States has undertaken since it helped Japan raise the value of the yen in 1998.</p>
        <p>The United States has long lent its support to European integration because it is seen as a way of ensuring stability in a region where America has fought two world wars.</p>
        <p>The attempt to rescue the euro was closely intertwined with the Clinton administration's decision to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Several European nations, including Britain and France, have had sustained protests by truck drivers and others hurt by oil prices.</p>
        <p>Prices at the pump, already far higher in Europe than the United States because of heavy tax, have risen even more sharply here than across the Atlantic because oil is bought and sold in dollars, which have been rising in value against the euro almost in tandem with the oil price spike. American officials were counting on an uptick in European growth rates to extend the American-led economic expansion of recent years, something that seems less likely if Europe is hit by an inflationary shock.</p>
        <p>There was also growing trans-Atlantic concern that the weakness of the European currency and the inflationary impact of high-priced oil gave Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, his best opportunity since the Persian Gulf war to wreak havoc on his Western adversaries. With oil supplies already short, the Western world depends on Iraq continuing crude production, something he could cut off at any time.</p>
        <p>Group of 7 ministers in effect dismissed a French proposal to organize a summit meeting between the Western powers and OPEC. But they agreed to pursue bilateral contacts with OPEC counterparts, including a coming French session with Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Summers said he hoped that the United States' decision to provide 30 million barrels of oil from its reserves would persuade traders to stop snapping up forward contracts for oil in anticipation of severe winter shortages, a key factor behind the rising price.</p>
        <p>In comments the currency markets will have to decipher this week, Mr. Summers also stressed that there was ''no contradiction'' between his decision to sell dollars to buy euros and his oft-repeated view that a strong dollar is vital to American interests. His insistence that America has not changed its currency policy suggests that Mr. Summers does not foresee the euro's rising sharply against the dollar -- and, further, that any continued United States intervention in currency markets would be limited unless the euro resumes its plunge.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, as the Group of 7 ministers met in private sessions, President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic invited about 100 people representing charity and pressure groups concerned about globalization to debate the heads of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund at Prague Castle. The officials and protesters have gathered here for the annual meetings of the Washington-based lending agencies, which will continue for several days.</p>
        <p>During the two-hour session, followed by a walk through the gardens of the sprawling Prague Castle, many environmental and social activists peppered the World Bank president, James D. Wolfensohn, and the International Monetary Fund managing director, Horst Kohler, with an extensive list of demands.</p>
        <p>Several called for the complete abolition of the two Washington-based lending agencies, which were founded just after World War II to finance the reconstruction of Europe and stabilize world currencies. They have recently been under heavy pressure to improve the economic performance of poor and middle-income nations that receive most of their loans.</p>
        <p>On the streets, where protest organizers have vowed to stage major demonstrations beginning on Sunday, the biggest march today was by some 500 anarchists, many dressed in black with black masks.</p>
        <p>The crowd briefly blocked a highway. There was also a skirmish between anarchists and neo-Nazi skinheads, who were staging a rival demonstration near Prague's main railway station. At least one person was injured before the police arrived.</p>
