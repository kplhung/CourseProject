        <p>When Joel Klein steps down from the Justice Department this week, he will leave enforcement of the nation's antitrust laws in better shape than when he took over the antitrust division in 1996. He will, of course, be remembered most for taking on Microsoft. But beyond that celebrated case, Mr. Klein brought new energy and credibility to a division whose enforcement arm had lain dormant since the Reagan administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein's tenure did not start well. As acting head of the antitrust division, he approved unconditionally the merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex, eliminating the benefits that would come from future competition between these regional phone giants. But Mr. Klein made sound judgments in subsequent cases, showing that mainstream antitrust principles can be effectively applied to modern markets.</p>

        <p>When Joel Klein steps down from the Justice Department this week, he will leave enforcement of the nation's antitrust laws in better shape than when he took over the antitrust division in 1996. He will, of course, be remembered most for taking on Microsoft. But beyond that celebrated case, Mr. Klein brought new energy and credibility to a division whose enforcement arm had lain dormant since the Reagan administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein's tenure did not start well. As acting head of the antitrust division, he approved unconditionally the merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex, eliminating the benefits that would come from future competition between these regional phone giants. But Mr. Klein made sound judgments in subsequent cases, showing that mainstream antitrust principles can be effectively applied to modern markets.</p>
        <p>He went after Microsoft for using its dominant market position to thwart entry by competitors and  won a court order to break the company in two. Mr. Klein brought another challenging case against Visa and MasterCard for using their dominant position in credit cards to stifle innovation and block rivals. He also charged American Airlines with engaging in predatory practices. The ultimate outcomes of these cases are uncertain, but Mr. Klein deserves credit for bringing potentially abusive tactics by dominant firms under judicial review.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein blocked a series of mergers -- between Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, WorldCom and Sprint, and Northwest and Continental -- that had the potential to harm consumers. He also broke up price-fixing cartels, notably between international vitamin companies. He has not forged bold new antitrust principles or direction. What he has done is take antitrust enforcement seriously. For that alone he warrants the nation's gratitude.</p>
