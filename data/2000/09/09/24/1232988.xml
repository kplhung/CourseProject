        <p>YOU can't pick up a newspaper today without feeling deluged by reports on miraculous medical discoveries. The authority of science is as much a part of our worldview as an even higher authority was for our grandparents. So intense is the belief in the medical profession's ability to cure our ills that it is striking to note it was only 75 years ago that a medical scientist first entered American literary consciousness in the exalted role of hero. Sinclair Lewis's 1925 novel, ''Arrowsmith,'' is the story of a physician's relentless search for truth. Unlike in other novels of this period or before it, the main character is no cleric, writer or philosopher. He is not even a particularly great doctor. Lewis, aware of the wide public interest in medical progress (not unlike our current fascination with all things genetic), introduced millions of readers to a young man who dedicates himself to the hottest field of his day: bacteriology.</p>
        <p>The novel's influence extends far beyond its immediate critical and popular success. I well recall how as a first-year medical student I raptly read about the adventures of Martin Arrowsmith when I should have been committing to memory the intricacies of the brachial plexus. Somehow it was comforting to recognize the same traits in Martin and his fellow students and teachers, from the purely mercenary to the honorable, that I saw daily in lecture halls and hospital wards. Indeed, my battered copy of ''Arrowsmith'' is annotated throughout with a repeated pen-scrawled comment: ''Still true!'' I am hardly alone: countless people have been inspired to research careers because of Martin's intense devotion to science. More significant, the novel records and predicts both many of the medical profession's successes and the problems that still torment it today. For all these reasons, I teach the novel every year to my medical students.</p>

        <p>In the autumn of 1922, the celebrated author of ''Main Street'' and ''Babbitt'' was introduced to a bacteriologist named Paul de Kruif by the critic H. L. Mencken and Dr. Morris Fishbein, the editor of The Journal of the American Medical Association. De Kruif, who'd earned his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, had just been dismissed from the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now Rockefeller University) because it had become clear that his hands itched for a fountain pen instead of test tubes. Lewis and de Kruif (who was still several years away from his string of best-selling books, including ''The Microbe Hunters,'' popularizing health topics ranging from germs to sex hormones) agreed to collaborate on a medical novel; they soon booked passage on a steamship to the West Indies, where they could work without distractions. By January 1923, Lewis was exclaiming that de Kruif was ''perfection. . . . In all of this there's a question as to whether he won't have contributed more than I shall have.'' De Kruif was essential to the novel. Nearly all the scientists, physicians and medical institutions portrayed in ''Arrowsmith'' were drawn from his experience. The result is a remarkably accurate (if not always complimentary) historical document.</p>
        <p>Lewis, the favorite son of Sauk Centre, Minn. (and the actual son of a doctor), had a genius for mining the rich quarry of the American Midwest, and there much of ''Arrowsmith'' is set. Martin's medical school, the University of Winnemac, ''a Ford Motor Factory'' where ''buildings are measured by the mile,'' is a precise pen portrait of the University of Michigan. Martin becomes a general practitioner in a small town in North Dakota and a public health officer in Iowa, then is called to a post at the prestigious McGurk (read Rockefeller) Institute in New York City.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the novel's greatest strength is its veracity of detail about a life in medicine, from the conflicts that arise between commerce and altruism to the design of scientific experiments. Nowhere is this more clearly seen than when a plague epidemic raging on a Caribbean island affords Martin an opportunity to test his newly discovered magic bullet, bacteriophage. Martin's wife, Leora, insists on joining him on the dangerous trip. Soon enough, Martin immerses himself in a meticulous experiment where half the island's inhabitants receive bacteriophage and the rest a placebo. Bacteriophage was no fictional device. A viral parasite that kills bacteria, it was the talk of the bacteriology world soon after its discovery by Felix d'Herelle of the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1917. One of many marchers in the parade of great medical hopes, bacteriophage was eventually cast aside for something even more miraculous: antibiotics.</p>
        <p>Late one night, a lonely Leora finds a cigarette Martin left behind on his makeshift laboratory bench. Unaware that the housekeeper had accidentally spilled some plague culture on the cigarette, she smokes it in an effort to be closer to her absent husband and dies a miserable death before sunrise. Overwhelmed with grief, Martin damns science and gives bacteriophage to all who want it. While he receives international acclaim, he knows he botched the experiment. Again we encounter de Kruif's touch. In February 1901, de Kruif's bacteriology professor, Frederick Novy, returned to Ann Arbor with some specimens after investigating a plague epidemic in San Francisco's Chinatown. Some weeks later his laboratory assistant, a medical student who rolled his own Bull Durhams, unknowingly contaminated a cigarette he was about to smoke. He developed plague but survived.</p>
        <p>Integral to ''Arrowsmith'' was Lewis's insistence that Martin be both a physician and a scientist, personifying a conflict that continues to trouble doctors and their patients. Who is more important in the conquest of disease: the compassionate, sympathetic healer or the cold, obsessive investigator trying to ascertain the cause of disease, who, if successful, would render the doctor obsolete?</p>
        <p>The other best-selling book about medicine published in 1925 was Dr. Harvey Cushing's painstakingly detailed ''Life of Sir William Osler.'' It was published only a few years after Osler's death, but Osler had already entered the pantheon of medical heroes. Both books won a Pulitzer Prize in 1926 (though Lewis, famously, turned his down). To the forward-thinking scientists revered by Lewis and de Kruif, the frock-coated Dr. Osler (1849-1919) was a quaint relic. As Michael Bliss notes in his recent biography of Osler, ''William Osler: A Life in Medicine,'' Cushing accepted his prize hoping Osler's benevolent bedside manner would overshadow the glorification of medical research in ''Arrowsmith.'' But Cushing misinterpreted the exquisite tension that Martin negotiates. Martin understands the imperative to conduct objective experiments that definitively prove a hypothesis. But unlike many of his laboratory-based colleagues, he often sides with the healers when confronted by the demands of the sickbed.</p>
        <p>While hilariously assailing the babbittry of the medical profession, Lewis captures the absolute passion for discovery required of a successful scientist. This is no mere job. It's a religion. In one of the book's most moving scenes, Martin prays in his laboratory: ''God give me a quiet and relentless anger against all pretense and all pretentious work and all work left slack and unfinished. God give me a restlessness whereby I may neither sleep nor accept praise till my observed results equal my calculated results or in pious glee I discover and assault my error. God give me strength not to trust to God!''</p>
        <p>A satire of Judeo-Christian expressions of the ideal life, perhaps, yet sadly, today it's difficult to imagine a research scientist praying for anything so noble when there are patent applications for newly discovered genes to fill out and stock options to consider. As medical scientists and the biotechnology industry become increasingly intertwined, the doctor in me wishes he could prescribe a page or two of ''Arrowsmith'' each day to his more profit-driven colleagues. Perhaps Dr. Lewis could restore some health to the ailing condition of scientific idealism.</p>
