        <p>Although prices at the gas pump have soared this year, it could be worse.</p>
        <p>With state budgets in good shape, legislators and governors saw little need to raise excise taxes on gasoline and cigarettes this year, or sales taxes in general, according to CCH Inc., a provider of tax and business law software in Riverwoods, Ill., that recently released results of its annual consumer tax survey.</p>
        <p>''Cigarette taxes went through a round of increases in 1997 and 1998, and some states raised gas taxes in 1999 when prices were low, but with a strong economy, states haven't been pressed to find additional sources of revenue,'' said John Logan, a senior tax analyst at CCH.</p>
        <p>The survey, conducted in July, found that Connecticut, Nebraska and Nevada actually lowered per-gallon gas excise taxes from a year earlier. North Carolina and Maine raised their gas taxes.</p>
        <p>Maine, meanwhile, cut its sales tax by half a percentage point, to 5 percent.</p>
        <p>The vast majority of states also stuck to the same cigarette tax rates, though New York and New Hampshire raised theirs.</p>
