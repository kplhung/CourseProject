        <p>Q: Everyone seems to hate political ads. As a veteran of commercial advertising, what do you think are the worst sins of political advertising?</p>
        <p>Well, it's pretty abysmal, and it's getting worse as more money's thrown toward it. There's so much emphasis on the buy, and airing the spot a ridiculous number of times, and so little emphasis on production values.</p>
        <p>In the commercial arena, we know that if a commercial isn't interesting enough to engage people, it's wasted money. In politics, it seems to be the exact opposite. Like it doesn't matter how bad the commercial is, if you spend enough money on the buy, it will somehow annoy people into voting for your candidate.</p>

        <p>Q: Everyone seems to hate political ads. As a veteran of commercial advertising, what do you think are the worst sins of political advertising?</p>

        <p>In the commercial arena, we know that if a commercial isn't interesting enough to engage people, it's wasted money. In politics, it seems to be the exact opposite. Like it doesn't matter how bad the commercial is, if you spend enough money on the buy, it will somehow annoy people into voting for your candidate.</p>
        <p>Commercial ads are getting more varied. Why do campaign ads all seem the same?</p>
        <p>There's a fierce insistence that there are special rules for political commercials, things that we found out didn't work in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>What sort of rules?</p>
        <p>Mention the brand name at least three times, make sure that the package appears for X number of seconds -- all these types of things, which to me basically telegraph the fact that an ad is an ad. And if you're anti-advertising, which most normal people are -- we certainly don't need more of it in our lives -- you have a tendency to avoid it. So the more that you tell people upfront that an ad is coming, the less likely they're going to be around to receive it.</p>
        <p>Some advocates of cleaner campaigns say ads should focus only on the candidate. What do you think of that approach?</p>
        <p>Other people would like to see cleaner advertising. I would like to see better advertising. I don't think you bring people back into the process by having another white guy in a suit standing in front of a camera trying to look sincere. It would drive people out of the process out of boredom instead of out of distaste. I don't know which is worse.</p>
        <p>Are there any restrictions on advertising that do make sense to you?</p>
        <p>Oh, I'm constantly amazed at the toothlessness of the F.E.C. and the way that people can get away with twisting, distorting or outright lying in political ads. I can remember when we were working on Wellstone's first campaign, people said, You can do this and you can do this. And I said, You can lie in political advertising? Because in commercial advertising you've got all sorts of people looking over your shoulder: your competitors, who would file suit immediately if you put a false claim in the ad; the F.C.C. regulating things; your customers. It just doesn't work that way in politics.</p>
        <p>Your candidate is a serious guy. Are there special obstacles to marketing someone who's anti-glitz, anti-pretense, even, in a sense, anti-marketing?</p>
        <p>There were obstacles just in getting Ralph Nader to consider doing advertising. And remember Joe Isuzu? You'd never be able to do that with Ralph because he'd say, That guy's on TV telling lies. We'd say, Well, yeah, that's the joke. And Ralph would say, But he's on TV telling lies. There are a couple of other specific things that he said that he won't do, but I can't tell you what they are because I'm going to still, hopefully, talk him into doing them.</p>
        <p>But we should assume that subliminal advertising is way out of the question.</p>
        <p>We were going to do a subliminal ad for Wellstone. I always thought it would be the perfect test to figure out if it really works or not. But we were going to make fun of the whole idea. Wellstone was going to tell you that you're about to see a subliminal ad and then make fun of it. It's been an idea that's intrigued me for a long, long time.</p>
        <p>What are you working on now?</p>
        <p>We just finished something called ''The Ballad of Ralph Nader.''</p>
        <p>Can you sing a bit of it?</p>
        <p>I wouldn't do it justice.</p>
        <p>O.K., fine. But can you give me any idea of the things you're still hoping to talk Nader into? Do they involve some kind of imagery?</p>
        <p>No, it has nothing to do with silliness, like having him be an action figure or walk around in a barrel or anything like that.</p>
        <p>Not that those would be bad ideas.</p>
        <p>Ah, the action figure's been done. I don't know where that idea of having him walk around in a barrel comes from. Maybe that's not a bad idea.</p>
