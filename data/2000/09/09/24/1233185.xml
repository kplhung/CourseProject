        <p>TONY ORLANDO called the other day about show tickets. Joe Pesci wanted a good place to eat after playing a few rounds of golf. Bobby Rydell was simply looking for a quiet place to rest his vocal chords.</p>
        <p>All three celebrities dialed the same number, the one number many entertainers call when they want to be entertained.</p>
        <p>Johnny Mathis on line 1? Pick up the phone, John Boyle. ''I try to create a personal relationship with everyone and accommodate them,'' said Mr. Boyle. ''Hey, that's my job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyle, 44, is the senior host at the new Atlantic City Hilton Casino, where he ''represents the property,'' or tries to sell people, famous or otherwise, on the idea of spending their time, and their money, at the Hilton.</p>
        <p>''I just got off the phone with John Oates's parents,'' Mr. Boyle said recently, referring to half of the musical duo Hall and Oates. ''They said they were coming in from Philadelphia for a day trip, and they asked me if I could line up a few things for them to do.''</p>
        <p>Before taking his job at the Hilton last year, Mr. Boyle, who lives with his wife and 17-year-old daughter in the town of Palermo, had already made a name for himself as a star among stars in the Atlantic City area, having worked for 13 years as the maitre d'hotel at the Showroom in the nearby Tropicana Hotel, where his palms were greased nightly for helping celebrities and high rollers, as well as their families and friends, get the best seats in the house to concerts, theater performances, boxing matches and other events.</p>
        <p>When Whitney Houston came to town wanting to see Dionne Warwick perform, she called John Boyle. When Jackie Mason arrived to see Wayne Newton, he called John Boyle. And when the musical group Chicago showed up to see the Moody Blues, guess who they called?</p>
        <p>''It was a powerful job,'' said Mr. Boyle. ''I had the ability to get things done.''</p>
        <p>From the words scribbled across hundreds of photographs by the celebrities he dealt with over the years, it appears Mr. Boyle did indeed get things done for the rich and famous:</p>
        <p>To John, Best of the best</p>
        <p>Best Wishes, Ray Charles</p>
        <p>To John: You're the best</p>
        <p>Best Always, Sam Kinnison</p>
        <p>''And this one, I'll always cherish,'' said Mr. Boyle, holding a photograph of himself and Frankie Valli, in which the singer is cutting a piece of cake at his 60th birthday party.</p>
        <p>Of course, there were those nights when even the maitre d', the most powerful man in the house, couldn't please everyone.</p>
        <p>''I remember the night when Patti LaBelle stood up on stage and told a packed house 'thanks to the maitre d', my family is sitting way in the back,' '' said Mr. Boyle. ''It was pretty embarrassing.''</p>
        <p>There were also those nights when Mr. Boyle watched in amazement as Hollywood giants flexed their muscles, sending members of their entourage scurrying to run the zaniest of errands.</p>
        <p>''One night, I watched as Jerry Lewis sent out his limousine driver for a certain brand of Kleenex tissue that he needed to blow his nose,'' said Mr. Boyle. ''I don't think I'll ever forget that one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis heads a short but noteworthy list of celebrities that Mr. Boyle has put together and stamped ''not much fun to work with.''</p>
        <p>That list includes Miss LaBelle, Miss Warwick and Harry Belafonte, each of whom, said Mr. Boyle, ''was no pocketful of roses.''</p>
        <p>There were those nights when Mr. Boyle really earned his tips, having to juggle seating for famous husbands and wives, whose secret lovers had showed up unannounced.</p>
        <p>''I put one very famous singer's wife in the front row of the Showroom one night, and I made sure to put his mistress way in the back,'' said Mr. Boyle, who would not divulge the name of the singer.</p>
        <p>Shortly thereafter, just when he thought things couldn't get more sticky, Mr. Boyle looked down at his long list of celebrities and their guests one evening to find that another famous singer had his wife -- and his boyfriend -- on the same list.</p>
        <p>''He just screwed up the planning that evening,'' remembered Mr. Boyle. ''Somehow, I pulled him through it, and he was very thankful that I did.''</p>
        <p>Atop Mr. Boyle's list of favorite celebrities and finest tippers are Mr. Oates -- ''John is cool, Darryl's a little wacky,'' he jokes -- and other singers like Tony Bennett, Tom Jones, Robert Palmer and Barry Manilow, as well as the country singer Vince Gill, the comedians Joan Rivers and Scott (Carrot Top) Thompson, and the pro basketball player Anthony Mason.</p>
        <p>''Mason always get a bad rap,'' said Mr. Boyle, ''but he's a really nice guy.''</p>
        <p>An athlete himself who is training for the Ironman Triathlon World Championship in Hawaii on Oct. 14, a race that requires swimming 2.4 miles, cycling 112 miles and running 26.2 miles, Mr. Boyle has fond memories of friendly, large-tipping athletes like Charles Barkley and Sugar Ray Leonard, but he was a bit surprised when one of New York's former baseball heroes, Lenny Dykstra of the New York Mets, arrived at the Showroom one winter night in 1987 to celebrate the Mets' World Series championship.</p>
        <p>Apparently, Mr. Dykstra had left his grease home that evening, leaving the helpful hands of Mr. Boyle quite dry.</p>
        <p>''He ordered two bottles of champagne, and basically stiffed everyone,'' said Mr. Boyle.</p>
        <p>But getting stiffed, Mr. Boyle has learned over the years, is just as much a part of his business as getting a $50 bill stuffed in his front pocket.</p>
        <p>''Years ago, I was on the golf course with Fabian, just hanging around, and he told me 'I'm going to call you at home, we'll play golf together,' '' said Mr. Boyle.</p>
        <p>''I'm still waiting for the phone to ring.''</p>
