        <p>The $11 billion banker?</p>
        <p>When Credit Suisse First Boston closes its acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, one of the prize assets it will gain will be the firm's junk-bond underwriting group, for years the market leader. One of the most prominent executives involved with that team is Kenneth Moelis, the firm's corporate finance chief.</p>
        <p>The key asset on Wall Street is the people. In fact, Credit Suisse tried in August to acquire Mr. Moelis, a 10-year Donaldson veteran, directly, but he turned down the job offer. But he had not heard the last of the Credit Suisse bankers: just weeks later, they were back, but this time buying his whole firm.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure had they been able to buy the banking business on its own, they would have,'' said one friend of Mr. Moelis, who was amused by the timing of the job offer. ''Kenny is worth a lot, but I don't think he's worth $11 billion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moelis will still do well, as co-head of investment banking for the Americas at the merged entity. Neither he nor his new colleagues would comment.</p>
