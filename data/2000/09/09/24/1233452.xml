        <p>Daren D. Turman, one of the bike officers, said that in one instance a man had had a seizure behind some parked cars and his companion flagged Mr. Turman down. ''If I hadn't been riding the bike, the person would have had a hard time getting help,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another benefit: ''I've lost an inch and a half on my waistline.''</p>
