        <p>It wasn't supposed to be this way.

Knifing through the jet stream at 50,000 feet, I would put up my stockinged feet, take my good wife's gloved hand, beam at our Cleaver-perfect children across the wide aisle and doze as we rocketed safely into our future at 600 miles per hour.

        <p>It wasn't supposed to be this way. We were told to expect medium-rare chateaubriand and exotic fondues and white linen antimacassars gentling our dreamy heads and fancy French wine all around and the bell ring of sterling flatware. These I was promised. Knifing through the jet stream at 50,000 feet, I would put up my stockinged feet, take my good wife's gloved hand, beam at our Cleaver-perfect children across the wide aisle and doze as we rocketed safely into our future at 600 miles per hour. This is what we were sold. Promises were made, the ancient newsreel promises of commercial jet travel, circa 1960. The new magic carpet for the new American leisure class.</p>
        <p>Forty years later, we receive instead a $1,200 coach seat half the width of a human pelvis, a mismatched pair of circus peanuts and the in-flight director's recut of ''Bicentennial Man.'' Behold, air rage.</p>
        <p>This has been the season of discontent for enraged passengers and the various carriers who brand, herd and ship them from point to point. Record delays and flight cancellations; flight attendants marching for more security and fewer airborne cocktails; air-traffic experts and the secretary of transportation convening summits to noodle out why all these thunderstorms make the darned planes so darned late. Some airlines are even handing out free frequent-flier miles to compensate disgruntled passengers. Which is pretty gallingly rich: ''Now that you're sure you'd rather rot in a Jalalabad prison than ever fly with us again, c'mon back!''</p>
        <p>There is blame to be laid everywhere, of course. Overcrowding lies at the root of most in-flight incivility: more people going more places means more people in line, more people at the gate, more people trying to lever their washer-dryer combos into the overhead bin while more people trapped in the aisle behind them hiss more obscenities. More missed connections, more friction, more heat, more anger. More media coverage. We love our easily cataloged two-syllable catch phrases like ''road rage'' and ''air rage,'' and we lump them together even though they have nearly opposite causes. In the former case, people go crazy with the illusion of vehicular control; in the latter, they're driven crazy because they have no control at all.</p>
        <p>The entire system is ''maxed out,'' say the experts. Why? Didn't the feds or the airlines see this coming? Once you deregulate and start offering discount fares, how can you feign surprise when we all show up? Shouldn't air supply meet air demand? Haven't they been begging us for half a century to fly with them? To think of flying as something fun and accessible and safe? And those beaches! Don't forget the island beaches in the airline television commercials, powdery white and perfect and reachable only by air! Or the loving, apple-cheeked, sweater-clad grandparents hugging their reunited families in empty holiday terminals!</p>
        <p>No mention in the fine print, though, of supercilious flying waitresses or hostile counter clerks or belligerent, drunken seatmates or the complex nature of the hostage-kidnapper relationship that begins once that airplane door is closed. To say nothing of the subminiature dinners and the fictional timetables and the arcane calculus whereby your seat always costs $700 more than the one next to it. And why are we bargain-hunting for every seat, anyway? Shouldn't the prices all be the same, like movie tickets? No wonder some of us are putting up our dukes.</p>
        <p>But we, the traveling public, are culpable, too. We are still a nation of suckers after all, greedy rubes trapped in the feedback loop of the advertising cycle, forever consuming goods and services in the half-witted belief that the new soap or the new soup or the aisle seat on the exit row will deliver not only scads of lather, beefy goodness and an on-time arrival rate of 98 percent, but a slimmer, sexier, more fully self-actualized identity as well. The worm at the core of it all, as always with humanity, is want. We want what we were promised -- ease and speed and gentility, exoticism and elegance. We want the transcendent fantasy world technology keeps failing to deliver.</p>
        <p>Spoiled by our prosperity, our sense of consumer entitlement and our newly computerized myth of the instantaneous, in which Bill Gates shrinks the planet to the size of a mouse pad and global travel seems to require no more effort than clicking, dragging and dropping ourselves on faraway destinations, we become insufferable. We are boorish, childish passengers with outrageous expectations, self-important, ill behaved, underdressed, overpacked and sublimely oblivious to the fact that a jumbo jet was never intended as a high-altitude dinner theater. We seem to have forgotten that travel takes place in the actual, not the virtual, world and suffers reality's exigencies. That 100,000 pounds of aluminum and resort wear and bad manners can haul itself into the night sky and fly safely to Cleveland should, until they invent those damn transporter beams they keep promising us, be enough. Don't get so worked up if you're late. It's Cleveland.</p>
        <p>And while you're all going no place special in such a hurry, try to remember that what you're really trapped in is your own perceptions, and that your anger comes from the common American convictions that the laws of physics and the rules of commerce and their consequent indignities apply to everyone but you. That's why it's O.K. for me to sneak an extra duffel full of frozen shoulder roasts on board for the folks back home, but it's not O.K. for you. And don't drink so much when you fly -- it makes you bloated and ornery. And take your elbow off my arm rest! And cover your mouth when you cough, for God's sake!</p>
        <p>Because only by recognizing your flaws can I ever hope to overcome them.</p>
