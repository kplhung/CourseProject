        <p>WHAT first catches the visitor's eye on entering the Connecticut River Museum in Essex is a group of architectural models, the heart of the exhibition ''Framing the Past.'' Graceful, lean skeletons of historic barns and houses, crafted of vintage wood at a scale of one inch to one foot, they complement the spare beauty of the exhibition space and allow glimpses of the river sparkling outside the windows.</p>
        <p>Yet looks are not the major thrust of the show. ''Framing the Past,'' which is subtitled ''The Shipwright, Housewright and Barnbuilder in the Connecticut River Valley,'' seeks to preserve the knowledge of centuries-old building crafts and to explore the relationship between them by examining the tools and methods used. Above all, the display aims to instill an understanding of the past and of the value of protecting its landmarks.</p>
        <p>''The Connecticut River was used early on for commerce and played an important role in the settlement of the colony,'' said Jeffrey L. Bradley, the show's guest curator. ''The shipwright, housewright and barn builder of the 17th, 18th and 19th century needed trees, and the virgin forests of Connecticut provided a wealth of material to work with.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Bradley guided a visitor through the exhibition, he suggested that the timbers needed to frame a ship could have been felled and hand hewn by house and barn builders and then hauled to shipyards to be joined by ship builders, who possessed similar skills.</p>
        <p>''They used many of the same tools and, at times, they worked together,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley, a self-taught architectural historian and conservator, has been a student of New England's architectural heritage for more than 25 years. During this period, he said, he has had ''the rare opportunity to examine, measure, photograph, document, restore, dismantle, re-erect or preserve'' hundreds of historic structures, particularly in the New Haven and Connecticut River Valley areas.</p>
        <p>''Everything that I am doing is attributable to Eric Sloane and to his ability to draw the past,'' he said, referring to the artist and author of several illustrated books on Early American antiques, tools and barns.</p>
        <p>''Before I knew it, my love for the American barn had grown to the point where, even as a teenager, I wanted to own one,'' he recalled, describing his distress as he watched barns and houses being torn down one by one, and farmland in his home town of Branford turn into housing developments. In time, he was able to acquire threatened barns, store them in the former warehouse he calls his art studio, and re-erect them when a willing customer was found. He also took to collecting antique tools and architectural fragments, crafting furniture and accessories out of salvaged barn parts, building authentic reproduction kits, creating educational exhibits and constructing the structural models that enliven the present exhibition.</p>
        <p>''You're looking at all my junk right now,'' he said, sweeping his arm in the direction of a display of tools that included lumber saws, broad axes, adzes, hatchets, draw knives, cant hooks, burl mallets and a particularly handsome chisel with a carved wooden handle.</p>
        <p>''I truly make a living from these ancient tools,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>Alongside the tools is an authentic, full-scale replica of a scarf joint -- a traditional method, used by shipwrights as well as barn builders, of joining two timbers together to produce a beam long enough for a ship's keel or the plate of a barn.</p>
        <p>A diminutive scarf joint is in evidence in the scale model of a Dutch barn, the largest and most detailed of the models he has been building for the past three years, and the only one on display to come from outside Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''It was built in New York State, outside Albany,'' Mr. Bradley said, ''an area originally settled by the Dutch, and it's very reflective of their building techniques -- a whole different world of architecture from that of English settlers. Dutch barns are among the finest in America,'' he continued. ''They are now very popular and desirable and have become an endangered species. There is even a Dutch Barn Preservation Society.''</p>
        <p>The model is constructed with removable wooden pegs -- 220 of them, one for each intersection, just as the original barn had been.</p>
        <p>''You sit right here and I'll pull it apart for you'' he proposed, an offer that immediately drew the attention of several young visitors.</p>
        <p>''I often take it apart with kids and then we have a barn-building party,'' he said, referring to the frequent hands-on demonstrations held on weekends during the run of the show.</p>
        <p>Each of the models is identified and each has a story to tell. A Connecticut barn, originally 24 by 32 feet, framed in chestnut and oak, was built in Killingworth in the early 1800's.</p>
        <p>''It was termite-infested, its chances of survival almost nil,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''Last year, I approached the woman who owned it and she agreed to sell. I had a client who was determined to get an old barn. So I dismantled it and re-erected it on his land in Chester. It cost a lot of money, more than building a new one. But it becomes an emotional thing, a preservation thing,'' he continued. ''Some people want to be involved in that; others, not at all.''</p>
        <p>Another model celebrates the outdoor privy. One of few such outbuildings still extant can be seen at the Killingworth Historical Society.</p>
        <p>Each model sits atop a table custom made for the purpose. Crafted out of hand-hewn beams and wide boards, with legs of chestnut timbers and aprons of 200-year-old pine, the tables are, in Mr. Bradley's words, ''a testament to the early settlers who cleared the land and built the barns and farmhouses.''</p>
        <p>''Framing the Past'' remains on view at the Connecticut River Museum (67 Main Street, Essex) until Oct. 31. The museum (once a passenger and freight depot for steamboats) is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Admission is $4, $2 for children. The number to call for information about gallery demonstrations is (860) 767-8269.</p>
