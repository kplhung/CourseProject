        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Lisa Zeidner's excellent article on film adaptations of Henry James's novels [''It's Hard Adapting Henry James. Still, They Keep Trying,'' Sept. 10] overlooks the fact that James himself did not share the ''assumptions about money and manners'' that he treated in his books. His keen eye for the way corrupt psychological and social forces lead to ruthless manipulation of others is one of his claims to modernism. Perhaps his notoriously elliptical style was an attempt to shield his audience or maybe even himself from his insights into the workings of society.</p>

        <p>''The Wings of the Dove'' may be the most successful James film because this novel most directly expresses that idea, and the film follows suit, albeit in slightly watered-down form. Under the genteel surfaces of ''The Golden Bowl,'' Adam Verver and his daughter even more unabashedly use their money and power to exploit and crush others; let's hope the film acknowledges that. Moviemakers might do well to see the hard-edged themes that are going on under those ''lacy parasols.''</p>
