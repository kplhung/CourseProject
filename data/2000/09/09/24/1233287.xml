        <p>The evening was one of doom and gloom. The rain rolled off the roof of Rosenberger's Boat Livery and collected in a silver puddle in front of the open door.</p>
        <p>The signs nailed to the building's wooden walls promise skiffs for hire, sand worms for sale and cold beer. It is, perhaps, the oldest boat rental house in America, its denizens like to say. They affectionately call it the Worm Hole, and it stands on wood pilings and landfill in the waters off City Island.</p>
        <p>Inside, it was warm and comfortable, a museum of fishing rods and crab pots and stuffed animals. Four crusty pelicans sat at the pine: Tommy the Irishman, Trader John the owner, Walshie the pile driver and Billy the carpenter.</p>
        <p>Tommy Reilly said he is 110 years old, which of course is a fish tale, but his time could be measured by the ring stains left by the cans of beer. On this dreary evening, Tommy had been at the bar for six Budweisers and this did not include his morning drinking session.</p>
        <p>Tommy is a stout, rheumy-eyed man with a square head of closely cropped hair. He can be found in the left hand corner of the bar next to the rickety stool. At the Worm Hole only beer and wine are served because anything more would be dangerous. A can of Budweiser costs $1 to go and $1.50 to stay.</p>
        <p>''You're paying for the ambience,'' Tommy said. ''And I'm the ambience.''</p>
        <p>The place closes for nothing. Take the big northeaster of 1992, for instance. It wiped out the piers and sucked the skiffs to the bottom of the sea. But inside the Worm Hole, there were four men and eight cats sitting on the bar watching the cars float by.</p>
        <p>''Oh, sure, we drank plenty of beers that day,'' Tommy said. ''We got priorities here.''</p>
        <p>Then there was the fire of '97 that ate the roof off the place, which opened 110 years ago. The fireman were upstairs dousing the flames. Downstairs, with water cascading through the floor boards, Tommy and Trader John were drinking draft beer.</p>
        <p>''Like any gin mill, you can get in trouble,'' Tommy philosophized. He has seven sons, two daughters and an ex-wife. He knows something about trouble. ''But trouble don't really happen here. It's a secret spot.''</p>
        <p>The best time to come to the Worm Hole is now, the off season, when the weekenders and suburbanites are anchored to shore. What the visitor is likely to hear is the Yankee game and an augury of the impending winter.</p>
        <p>The men quote liberally from ''The Old Farmer's Almanac,'' a sort of handbook for life on the lowlands. The almanac portends a mild winter with a slightly higher than normal snowfall for the New York region.</p>
        <p>But, if that's true, the City Islanders want to know, why have the autumn fish runs been paltry and why have the mussels moored themselves high on the banks?</p>
        <p>''No telling with nature,'' Billy said. ''The almanac has been screwy for three years now.''</p>
        <p>''Only one thing's for certain,'' Tommy said. ''Round here, we don't die. We just dry up and blow away.''</p>
