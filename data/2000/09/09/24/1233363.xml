        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Teresa Smalls, the main figure in your article, could be a poster woman for Planned Parenthood. At age 27, as she sits impatiently for the Family Court to address her case, she is seen with her beautiful 1-year-old daughter and the baby's 22-year-old father. As of now she has five children under age 10 by four different fathers.</p>
        <p>The baby sleeps, but the other children are in foster care because they bite and abuse one another.</p>

        <p>Teresa Smalls, the main figure in your article, could be a poster woman for Planned Parenthood. At age 27, as she sits impatiently for the Family Court to address her case, she is seen with her beautiful 1-year-old daughter and the baby's 22-year-old father. As of now she has five children under age 10 by four different fathers.</p>
        <p>The baby sleeps, but the other children are in foster care because they bite and abuse one another.</p>
        <p>Your article eloquently describes the plight of mothers like Ms. Smalls but fails to ask how these cycles of fatherless, young children at risk can stop. Ms. Smalls has a lawyer, a caseworker, a foster care system and a Family Court that will slowly address these problems. But who among these professionals will teach and help her with birth control, disease protection and legal abortions? And what measures apply to serial runaway fathers?</p>
