        <p>FOR David Densberger, who last week hauled canned tuna from New Orleans to Chicago in his 18-wheeler and then took a load of fresh vegetables on the much shorter hop across Wisconsin to St. Paul, the building energy crisis has a precise cost: the extra $300 that he now spends each week on diesel fuel.</p>
        <p>That was the $300 that Mr. Densberger, who is 53, had been putting aside to buy a new rig, which he does every three years. His current tractor, in fact, will turn three in February, but as the price of a barrel of crude oil has climbed to its highest level in a decade, Mr. Densberger can no longer save for a down payment. Unable to raise the rates he charges to haul freight as fast as his fuel prices have climbed, he sees no choice but to keep the old rig rolling and his fingers crossed that oil prices will fall soon. ''What else can I do?'' he asked. ''I can't stop driving and let my truck go back to the finance company and ruin my credit and not have a way to make a living.''</p>
        <p>Ask about the impact on the American economy of the prolonged rise in petroleum prices and the more recent spike in natural gas -- both now at levels that provoked previous energy shocks -- and Mr. Densberger pops up among the hardest hit. On a scale of 1 to 10, he is close to 10, along with  tens of thousands of other owner-operators  in trucking who have not been able to offset the steep rise in diesel fuel prices. Corporate America in general, registering 4 or 5 on this scale, is struggling with the energy crisis much more than consumers, who appear to view higher prices for gasoline and heating fuel as more of a nuisance than a threat to their living standards. That puts them at 1 or 2 on the scale, so far.</p>
        <p>''It is not that people think they are immune to higher energy costs, but they don't believe the higher costs will persist,'' said Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey. ''That is the key to their indifferent behavior. They expect the spike in prices to be a temporary phenomenon, so they don't give it much attention.''</p>
        <p>Businesses certainly do. Worried about profits, many companies have found or are trying to find ways to offset the impact: They use less energy, obtain discounts on their energy purchases, charge a bit more when they can, or operate more efficiently.  And some companies, of course, are profiting from this latest energy crisis, which began stealthily about 18 months ago.</p>
        <p>But the economy is not profiting, even though economists are not forecasting doom, either. Each of the three other crises since 1973 ended in a recession, but this one appears unlikely to do so. It is, however, gradually taking some steam out of the nation's booming prosperity.</p>
        <p>''Without the energy crisis, the economy would have expanded at close to a 6 percent rate this year,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, an economics research firm. ''Now the consensus forecast is 5.2 percent growth.''</p>
        <p>If oil and natural gas prices remain stubbornly high through next year, economic growth will be reduced by an additional half percentage point, by some estimates.</p>
        <p>As the higher energy prices ripple through the economy, the big, early beneficiaries are obvious: the integrated oil companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron, Texaco and Conoco. They not only pump crude oil -- now selling for $32.68 a barrel, more than double the price during the spring of last year -- but they also refine it and sell it as gasoline, aviation fuel and heating oil. Net income at some of these giants has almost doubled this year, their best performances since the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>Oil companies are not the only winners. The airlines, already flooded with passengers in a booming economy, have raised fares 14 percent this year, more than covering the extra fuel costs. Delta enhanced profitability by investing, months ago and more than the other airlines, in futures contracts -- in effect, buying fuel in advance at well below the current market price.</p>
        <p>Some companies are even using the spike in heating fuel prices as a selling opportunity. The Carrier division of United Technologies, for instance, is pushing a remote thermostat control that it makes for utility companies. Three utilities are beginning to use the control to adjust the thermostats of homeowners, with their permission. ''A family hardly notices if its utility supplier, using an Internet connection, lowers the thermostat setting by a single degree in winter,'' said Matt Chadderdon, a Carrier spokesman, ''but across hundreds of homes there is a saving.''</p>
        <p>For most companies and industries, though, high energy prices are a risk. FedEx, a huge consumer of aviation fuel as well as gasoline, has added a 4 percent surcharge to its rates. That has just about offset the increase in fuel costs -- without costing the company business so far, the company said. In the auto industry, sales of sport utility vehicles stopped rising over the summer, while sales grew for smaller vehicles that are more fuel-efficient but less profitable. Higher gasoline prices played a role in this shift, analysts said, but so  did a weaker stock market, whose earlier gains had helped people pay for S.U.V.'s.</p>
        <p>The chemical industry is particularly pressed to adjust. Natural gas and petroleum are basic raw materials in making chemicals, which in turn are the raw materials for all sorts of everyday products and parts, especially those made of plastic and fiber. Companies are using many strategies to nullify their rising energy costs and even gain a leg up. Nova Chemicals, for one, had fortuitously bought futures contracts that guaranteed natural gas for well under $3 per thousand cubic feet, or roughly three days of consumption in a single-family house. When the price shot up in the spring and summer to $4.50, the company sold the contracts at a profit of $100 million and bought gas on the spot market, gambling that prices would fall sharply before the money was used up in late October.</p>
        <p>''My personal view is that natural gas prices will come down in the next quarter,'' Jeffrey M. Lipton, Nova's chief executive, said last week.</p>
        <p>He is more optimistic than almost every forecaster. The price of natural gas is still a very strong $5.29 at the wellhead, while crude oil fell below $35 a barrel on Friday as President Clinton announced the staggered release of 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Gasoline, averaging $1.53 a gallon, is up 50 percent in two years. Natural gas prices began to rise sharply only last spring, but have doubled since then. Most homes use natural gas for heating, and household heating bills will rise by $200 or more this winter, according to an Energy Department estimate.</p>
        <p>When will prices drop significantly? Well, production cutbacks in 1998 and early 1999 by the oil-producing nations brought on the crisis, and only now is production revving up by enough to replenish inventories to the point that prices can begin to move back toward noncrisis levels. ''Rather than $25-a-barrel oil by Christmas,'' said Martin Bailey, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, ''we will get down to that level a year from now, or maybe 18 months from now.''</p>
        <p>The Consumer</p>
        <p>Impact Felt Mostly At the Gas Pump</p>
        <p>So the energy crisis is at high water today, but while companies struggle to adjust, the American consumer looks more like a spectator than a player.</p>
        <p>When consumers have become involved, they have done so mainly at the gas station, by buying regular rather than premium gasoline, for example, or by driving a few extra blocks in search of cheaper gas, particularly in California where it often tops $2, or by vacationing closer to home, or by leaving the S.U.V. in the garage and driving the family's more fuel-efficient second car. That is what Travis Wells, 32, a security guard in Chicago, did for a while over the summer, when gasoline prices in the upper Midwest jumped briefly above $2 a gallon.</p>
        <p>''For a while, I had to cut down on riding around altogether,'' said Mr. Wells. The reaction in Europe was much more demonstrative. Protesters in Britain blocked fuel deliveries there, disrupting commerce. Gasoline in Europe starts at more than $3 a gallon even in the least expensive countries because of high fuel taxes. The protesters sought tax relief to offset their extra outlays for fuel itself, but got it only in France.</p>
        <p>If the American consumer seems blase, that is partly because the impact of high energy prices on the robust American economy has been relatively minor so far. But it is there, economists say. Americans are spending an additional $115 billion, nearly 1 percent of the gross domestic product, on energy this year, according to an estimate by Larry Goldstein of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.</p>
        <p>That is $115 billion diverted from other spending, although some of that money is being recycled into the economy. Rising tax revenue from the sale of oil pumped in Oklahoma, for example, has helped to pay for a $3,000 across-the-board raise for the state's teachers. But more than half of the diverted $115 billion is going abroad to pay for imported oil, shrinking spending at home and gradually acting as a drag on the economy. The slowdown is becoming evident in falling retail sales, weaker job growth, a decline in industrial production, a drop in home construction permits and a mild decline in freight traffic.</p>
        <p>Still, there are good structural reasons that this energy crunch, as opposed to those in 1973, 1979 and 1990, seems unlikely to bring on a recession -- even if energy prices stay high into next year.</p>
        <p>For one thing, the old impact is no longer there; energy plays a smaller role in the economy. Americans have already made the shift to more fuel-efficient cars, energy-saving appliances and easier-to-heat buildings. Service companies and computer technology play a bigger role in the economy, shrinking the role of oil and natural gas. And consumers have learned a lot. In the Northeast, for example, some homeowners and landlords, stung by sharply higher heating oil prices last winter, have borrowed a tactic that is common in business: They have negotiated caps on what they will pay for heating oil this winter, using futures contracts bought by their oil suppliers.</p>
        <p>As a result of all these changes, the nation's spending on oil has declined to just above 3 percent of the gross domestic product this year, from 8.7 percent in the late 1970's, Mr. Goldstein estimated. Moreover, many fuel prices, high as they are, are really not much different than they were in the 1980's and early 1990's, adjusted for inflation. Even among  families with incomes of less than $40,000 a year, energy spending, measured as a percentage of a family's total spending, declined by two percentage points or more from 1985 to 1998, the latest year for which data is available, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
        <p>Still, these are the households, often living from paycheck to paycheck, that are hit hardest by the rise in the overall inflation rate after companies pass through some of their increases in energy costs. That rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has risen nearly a full percentage point over the last 12 months, to 3.4 percent, with nearly all of the increase attributed to higher energy costs.</p>
        <p>As inflation rises, workers find that their incomes buy less. And policy makers at the Federal Reserve worry that these workers will soon agitate successfully for higher wages. As wages rise, so will prices, as companies seek to cover their higher labor costs.</p>
        <p>That was the pattern in the last three oil shocks, and the Fed's response -- sooner or later raising interest rates to discourage the wage pressure and the price increases --  helped each time to push the economy into recession. This time, however, there has been relatively little wage pressure from a more subdued work force with less bargaining power. And in the absence of wage acceleration, the Fed seems willing to leave interest rates alone for now.</p>
        <p>''Without the wage pressure, it is pretty much a no-brainer for the Fed to wait out the higher oil prices,'' said Ben Herzon, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting and consulting service in St. Louis. ''If you don't get the wage-price spiral, then the inflation disappears when oil prices decline.''</p>
        <p>The Corporation  Raising Prices Now, Rather Than Later</p>
        <p>While the Fed waits, the nation's companies don't. The potential damage to earnings is too painful.</p>
        <p>That is especially the case in trucking, and particularly for the David Densbergers, whose single-truck operations are everywhere in the industry. Only in the last three months, he said, has he been able to add a 2 or 3 percent surcharge to his rates, a surcharge that ''only one in five customers actually pays.'' Even if all did so, he said, the extra income would not offset the rise in diesel fuel. He paid $1.57 a gallon in Arkansas last week and $1.71 in Wisconsin -- up from 90 cents to $1.10 before prices began rising 18 months ago.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Densberger, who lives in Berwick, Pa., grosses enough to continue to maintain a family income of $35,000 a year. To stay at that level, he, like most other truckers, puts in the maximum 70 hours a week of driving time allowed by federal law. When he rests, he turns off the engine and the air-conditioner, no matter the outside temperature. And he cuts other corners. His truck has a refrigeration system that runs on diesel fuel, so he tries to carry dry cargo on long hauls, like the canned tuna he took from New Orleans to Chicago.</p>
        <p>But there is that new rig he wants, and he also has to be concerned about emergencies. ''The $300 extra that I am spending on diesel fuel,'' he said, ''is the profit that would go to buy new tires, when I need them, or a new engine if the one I have blows up. Engines cost $15,000.''</p>
        <p>Bigger trucking companies, like C. R. England in Salt Lake City, which operates 2,600 tractor-trailers, are also feeling squeezed by higher fuel costs, but much less so than owner-operators like Mr. Densberger. The surcharges they impose on their rates are higher and stick better, and such companies buy huge amounts of fuel at a discounted price, averaging $1.50 a gallon, said Dan England, the chief executive.</p>
        <p>But workloads have risen for the nondriver staff, which has been trimmed to 700 from 820 two years ago. And during periods of peak demand, like the current harvest season, the company is more selective about whose business it takes.</p>
        <p>''Customers that have not granted us our full surcharge, we don't haul for them,'' Mr. England said, adding, ''Our profit margins have eroded, but they would be eroded a lot more if we had not taken the steps we have taken.''</p>
        <p>Dow Chemical has become similarly agile. The company buys naptha, ethane and other petroleum and natural gas-based ''feed stocks'' to make ethylene, which in turn is a chief building block of plastics from which so many consumer products and parts are made. With ethylene in abundant supply, raising its price is hard. So a big goal for Dow is to pay as little as possible for the ever more costly feed stocks. To do this, the company has installed new processing equipment that allows it to switch feed stocks on a dime, going to naptha, for example, if it is less costly than ethane or something else.</p>
        <p>''We are constantly running computer models that show us, literally on a daily basis, which raw materials are best to use,'' said William S. Stavropoulos, Dow's chief executive. He added: ''Our feed stock costs were up 60 percent in the second quarter, and that dinged our bottom line by 50 cents a share. Without all of these systems in place, we would have been dinged by half again as much.''</p>
        <p>For Enron, based in Houston, an energy crisis offers opportunity, particularly when prices are volatile, as they have been so far in this squeeze. Enron owns a natural gas pipeline and makes money in that business, but it also does well helping other companies manage risks. One client, the United Illuminating Company in Hartford, sold off its electricity generating plants under deregulation. Still, it is required for the next five years to charge customers only 5.5 cents a kilowatt hour, about what a 100-watt bulb consumes in 10 hours.</p>
        <p>''They decided that they did not want to take the risk of being forced to buy electricity for more than 5.5 cents,'' said Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron. ''So we agreed to deliver the electricity for less than that amount.''</p>
        <p>Enron does this by juggling a whole bunch of similar clients. On any given day, the electricity delivered to Hartford might cost too much, say 10 cents a kilowatt hour. But there is an offsetting profit elsewhere, say in the delivery of natural gas to a generating plant in Michigan. On balance, there has been enough profit from risk management in this energy crisis to contribute significantly to Enron's growing revenue and profits, Mr. Palmer said.</p>
        <p>Electricity has been a sideshow of this energy shock. Most electricity rates have remained fairly steady. But the combination of deregulation and not enough generating power has resulted in spot shortages and price spikes, particularly in the West. In this situation, the Ormet Primary Aluminum Corporation found that it could make more money by selling some of the electricity that it had bought to make aluminum, rather than make the aluminum itself.</p>
        <p>Using futures contracts, Ormet had bought the electricity at a discount and has sold some at a profit while shutting down some aluminum production at a smelter in Hannibal, Ohio. Aluminum production in the United States has dropped sharply in recent months, and prices have risen. Ormet's experience helps to explain why this is happening, said  John Mothersole, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's DRI, a data gathering and consulting service.</p>
        <p>The one great gift of an energy crisis should be the stimulus it provides for exploration and new drilling, to increase the production of oil and natural gas and thus take advantage of the higher prices. The growing supply then moderates prices. But exploration and drilling have picked up only recently in the United States, reflecting concern that new production will come on line just as prices fall.</p>
        <p>''Our philosophy with respect to capital spending is 'constancy of purpose,' '' said David O'Reilly, the chairman of Chevron, adding that ''oil and gas prices go up and down, but it's counterproductive to overreact to prices that are either atypically low or high.''</p>
        <p>That is why Charles Goodson, chairman of PetroQuest Energy, in Lafayette, La., is not throwing his hat in the air. His is one of the many small companies that account for most of the actual oil drilling and new production in the United States. Mr. Goodson said PetroQuest was  just getting back on its feet after the blow it suffered in 1998, when crude oil prices fell to as low as $10 a barrel, and his employees -- 25 then, 40 today -- all took pay cuts.</p>
        <p>''We've been consistently drilling wells through the ups and downs of this,'' Mr. Goodson said. ''You've got to weigh the prices we are getting now with the prices we were getting a year and two years ago. So when you average those things out, they don't look nearly so rosy.''</p>
