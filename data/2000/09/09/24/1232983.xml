        <p>Harry Shearer, voice of dozen characters on The Simpsons and co-creator of soon-to-be-rereleased This Is Spinal Tap, rails against what is expected of him as he grows older; photos (M) (special section, Men's Fashions of The Times) (part 2 of 2-part section)</p>

        <p>So, let me get this straight. I'm supposed to wear a tie. I'm supposed to take up golf. My musical boundaries are supposed to retract to the space between soft rock and smooth jazz. I'm supposed to, at some mysterious moment, start hitching my pants up to a point just below my armpits. Thanks, but no thanks.</p>
        <p>America has been offered a fine model of a grown-up for the last two months, and we'll be seeing quite a bit more of him. Dick Cheney, all the politerati tell us, is a quintessential grown-up, by which they mean he looks like he could be his own father. The man stands next to George W. Bush, and the idea that the two of them are but five years apart in chronological age seems as absurd as the idea of Dick Cheney's playing the sax on ''The Arsenio Hall Show.'' In fact, you look at Dick Cheney long enough, and the whole concept of ''The Arsenio Hall Show'' seems absurd.</p>

        <p>I know that seems like a good thing, but hear me out.</p>
        <p>My onetime girlfriend had a younger brother who was in a Beverly Hills punk band (this was when punk bands were only five years out of date, and Beverly Hills was much as it is now). She used to give him grief, along the lines of, ''That's just noise, not music.'' I pointed out to her that she was saying the same things our parents had said to us about the Rolling Stones, and she smiled a thin-lipped little acknowledgment, a grown-up smile that said, ''I've seen the other side, and it's calm over there, and ordered, and neat, and I live there now.''</p>
        <p>There is a commercial on television these days for a brand of adult diapers -- a brand that changed its name from a plural to a singular so as to suggest, one surmises, less a collection of ultra-absorbent underpants and more a state of mind. In the spot, a broad-beamed, middle-aged waitress talks about ''our'' generation, and how, when ''things'' happen, we ''deal with them.'' This is the face of the baby boomers really grown up, and, as a baby boomer to whom that particular ''thing'' has not yet happened, I say, ''No deal.''</p>
        <p>This whole ''growing up'' theme has emerged as a response to the forthcoming end of the Clinton Era, at least the Bill Clinton Era. We are preparing to separate from our Peter Pan President, so the focus groups have told the advertisers and the consultants, and so we're pretending to move on to more adult pursuits. The political parties duly, and dully, have obliged our proxies behind the one-way glass, serving up a guy who's been a grown-up since he finished teething and a guy who was a college sophomore until he suddenly decided to grow up at the age of 40. We have had it with charisma. We crave calm, we are told. Calm and extra absorbency.</p>
        <p>It probably doesn't come as news to you that America has a weird relationship with the Ages of Man. Our culture keeps trying to shrink the list down to two -- young enough to get laid, and old enough to belong to the A.A.R.P. The tectonic plates keep pushing us, slowly, inexorably, in one direction or another -- either prolonging our adolescence unbearably (as if it's such a nice age to begin with, if you're living inside it) or writing us off as, to use the current Hollywood term of contempt, ''grays.'' The only allowance for nuance is on the cable-TV selector, with which we're allowed to pass gracefully from MTV into the Docker-dom of VH1 before we succumb to the droning siren call of C-SPAN.</p>
        <p>I guess that it's the rejectionism of ''growing up'' that rankles me, the rejectionism exemplified by George W. Bush's approach to life: be dangerously dissolute during the first half, and prissily haughty during the second. When I was in college, working on the newspaper, my colleagues would hold regular parties. Every week I'd watch them drunkenly line up in front of the bathroom door at about 11 p.m., waiting to pay heaving homage to the porcelain god. That was all it took to convince me that teenage dissolution wasn't all it was cracked up to be. So, sorry, I have no years to reject. I've even integrated the photos of my shocking hair misjudgments into my current persona.</p>
        <p>We're supposed to be ''growing up'' all along. If I'm not mistaken, it also bears a close resemblance to ''growing.'' But I'll wager that none of the writers in this magazine praising the virtues of being a grown-up put on a suit and tie and took a train or grinding car commute into an office to tap out their paeans to maturity while the boss secretly monitored his computer's keystrokes. If I'm wrong, I'll buy each of them a box of Depend.</p>
