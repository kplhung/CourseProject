        <p>Our subject today is artistic suffering, and Malibu -- so bronze and sandy, so L.A. -- might seem like an odd place to muse on it.

        <p>Our subject today is artistic suffering, and Malibu -- so bronze and sandy, so L.A. -- might seem like an odd place to muse on it. Yet as I sit in Ed Harris's lushly planted yard listening to him talk about Jackson Pollock, it seems quite logical that the story of New York bohemia would gravitate toward sunny California. As we know, there are no second acts in American lives. But for those whose first acts are artfully tormented, there is always a movie.</p>
        <p>''Pollock'' will have its American premiere next Saturday as the centerpiece of the 38th New York Film Festival. Harris is in the title role, and the picture marks his directing debut. He gives us a Pollock with so much pain beneath his shy exterior that even when he's eating breakfast or buying milk at the grocery store, he appears monumentally doomed.</p>
        <p>No artist has more Hollywood promise than Pollock, a big, unbuttoned talent whose Drip paintings put America on the world art map and whose self-destructive ways were taken as added proof of his greatness: he was 44 when he died in a Long Island car wreck on a summer night in 1956.</p>
        <p>Harris is probably known best for his substantial performance as the astronaut John Glenn in ''The Right Stuff.'' Pollock, by contrast, did all the wrong stuff. He drank like a fish, spewed obscenities and startled rich collectors by relieving his bladder in public. And yet Glenn and Pollock were spiritually in sync. One flew in space, the other drew in space, and they both achieved hero status by living out the American yearning for adventure and freedom.</p>
        <p>''I get overwhelmed thinking about how much pain Jackson was in,'' Harris says, puffing on a cigarette and appearing attractively wounded. At 49, he resembles Pollock, with a reticent manner, blue eyes and a bald cranium. ''This is a guy who needed a mother. Lee didn't give him love or warmth. She nurtured him as a professional artist, but she didn't nurture him as a man.''</p>
        <p>Is he kidding? Lee Krasner (played in the movie by Marcia Gay Harden) was the archetypal long-suffering wife. She orchestrated her husband's career and nursed him through his hangovers and depressions, only to have him run off with a woman half her age.</p>
        <p>''There's the baby thing,'' Harris insists, his eyes brimming with sensitivity. ''Jackson loved children, but Lee refused to have a child with him.'' Harris is very much a guy's guy, it's clear. Can't he see why a woman would hesitate to have a baby with a bossy, alcoholic husband whose idea of a cozy evening at home was to upend the dinner table and send the dishes crashing to the ground?</p>
        <p>''Jackson would have been a good father,'' Harris loyally says. ''He appreciated innocence.''</p>
        <p>But could he have changed a diaper?</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' Harris drawls. ''Yeah. I think he might have. He would have seen patterns in the poop stains.''</p>
        <p>To prepare for the role, Harris actually had to learn how to paint. Of course, mastering the Drip requires an unconventional course of study. It's not much use to take an art class, draw from the figure or learn to render a bowl of fruit. No, art school can't teach you how to paint the experience of psychic release.</p>
        <p>So instead Harris did the following: he went to museums and looked hard at Pollocks. He read everything on the subject. He visited the Pollock-Krasner House in East Hampton, N.Y., sleeping in the artist's bed and flirting with mental disintegration in the studio-barn. He switched his cigarette brand to unfiltered Camels. Finally, he built a studio of his own on his property in Malibu, where he simulated Pollock's technique, laying a sheet of canvas on the floor and walking around all four sides as he tossed and flung liquid pigment from a stick.</p>
        <p>The Drip, by the way, is one of the grand misnomers in art history. Much as there are no cubes in Picasso's Cubism, there are few drips in Pollock's Drip paintings. Sure, it might look easy as pie. And we've all heard the sneering philistine charge that any 5-year-old could do it. But it took Harris several years of hard art labor before he was able to control his paint flow and reasonably duplicate the looping arabesques and linear tautness of a Pollock painting. He produced lots of duds; they went out with the trash. ''The bad ones have no rhythm or cohesiveness,'' he says. ''I think I did a few good things, but, compared to Jackson's, they don't have the same emotional need behind them.''</p>
        <p>Movies have always glamorized artists as moody geniuses with a knack for courting ruinous ends. ''Pollock'' ushers the artist into a bio-pic pantheon that includes Caravaggio, Artemisia Gentileschi, Vincent van Gogh, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Michelangelo (watching Charlton Heston slowly paint the Sistine ceiling is its own source of agony in ''The Agony and the Ecstasy''). I don't know that artists suffer more than writers, but they do spawn more films, probably because art and the movies are about the same thing: visual seduction.</p>
        <p>Besides, an artist's studio is a picturesque place, and no studio is more iconic than Pollock's. In contrast to the garrets of Paris, the ateliers with low, sloping roofs, Pollock opted for a country barn, redefining the modern artist as a guy who doesn't like to climb stairs. ''Pollock'' recreates his studio in splendiferous detail, down to the labels on the gallon-size cans of house paint -- though the glop inside them isn't authentic. As Harris says, ''We couldn't use oil paint because we all would have died from the fumes.'' An ecologically correct, health-conscious Pollock: only in the movies.</p>
