        <p>MUSCULAR dystrophy slowly makes its way through Terrence Stevens's body, shutting down muscle after muscle. But his continued imprisonment is equally contorting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stevens is in the eighth year of a prison sentence of 15 years to life for cocaine possession and conspiracy, imposed by a judge who has acknowledged he wished the state's rigid Rockefeller-era drug laws allowed him to hand down a lighter punishment. Nearly quadriplegic, Mr. Stevens, 33, relies on others to dress him, put him on the toilet and turn him in his bed every two hours. When he is taken out of Green Haven Correctional Facility here to see a specialist, he is shackled in chains that he is too weak to lift, never mind break. Prison officials have denied his request for a motorized wheelchair -- which doctors recommend -- saying inmates can push him.</p>
        <p>The daily struggle sometimes turns cruel. Mr. Stevens said that last month, after he argued with a corrections officer about telephone privileges, the officer accused him of exposing his genitalia. He was kept locked in his cell for a few days until a prison doctor and a nurse testified at a disciplinary hearing that Mr. Stevens could not have exposed himself. ''They had given testimony that he was unable to perform such an act because of his physical disability,'' said Linda Foglia, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Correctional Services. He was found guilty of harassment, but the exposure charges were dropped.</p>
        <p>It was reminiscent of a 1994 incident in which Mr. Stevens was kept in solitary confinement for 40 days for not complying with a strip search -- something else he could not do. Those charges were eventually reversed. A subsequent strip-search policy referred to Mr. Stevens as ''the one inmate in the facility who is unable, medically, to spread his buttocks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stevens now seeks a more dignified distinction. He recently applied to Gov. George E. Pataki for executive clemency. As one of his lawyers, Vincent F. Gugino, said: ''You have a human being imprisoned in his own body. What do the bars do?''</p>
        <p>HIS petition reflects how criminal justice has been contorted by 30-year-old laws that mandate longer minimum sentences for some lower-level drug crimes than for rape, manslaughter and armed robbery. Politicians from the governor on down have advocated easing the laws, but the will to change them collapses year after year in Albany.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stevens, who first showed signs of muscular dystrophy while growing up in a New York City housing project, was already in a wheelchair when he was arrested on a bus in Buffalo in 1990. He was charged with possessing just enough cocaine to draw a stiff mandatory sentence.</p>
        <p>He maintains his innocence, but an officer said he saw Mr. Stevens toss a bag containing drugs into the aisle of the bus. A friend traveling with Mr. Stevens testified against him. According to court documents, Mr. Stevens's friend, Patrick Sullivan, said that a state trooper involved in the drug transaction advised him ''to put it all on Terrence, to tell them that it was all Terrence's drugs.'' Mr. Sullivan received probation in exchange for testimony that helped convict Mr. Stevens and the trooper on drug charges.</p>
        <p>John V. Rogowski, the Erie County judge who sentenced Mr. Stevens, said in an interview in April that he regretted imposing the mandatory term. ''It's a sad commentary that the law doesn't permit for the proper relief that should be given a human being,'' said the judge, who is now retired.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stevens lives in a cellblock for handicapped inmates, where he receives physical therapy and constant care from nurses and other prisoners. ''They're handling the activities of daily life quite well for someone who's almost totally paraplegic,'' said Stanley Holstein, a Westchester County neurologist who examined Mr. Stevens recently.</p>
        <p>But ''the proper relief that should be given a human being'' remains beyond Mr. Stevens's grasp. A compressed lung makes breathing painful. It takes all the strength of his two hands to brush his teeth. Two fingers on his right hand, his stronger hand, have recently gone rigid. ''I feel like eight years should be enough time for taking a bus ride,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One day last week, Mr. Stevens's mother, aunt and grandmother visited him. His 85-year-old grandmother, Annie Mosley, said she had heard that Darryl Strawberry, the former New York Yankee, had been given house arrest for violating his probation. ''Why can't they do that for Terrence?'' she asked ''Strawberry can get away. Terrence can't.''</p>
