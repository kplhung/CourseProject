        <p>Q What practical recourse does a buyer have when a seller who has already signed a contract of sale nevertheless sells the property to someone else for a higher price? Is it true that trying to enforce a contract on a property that has already been sold is an exercise in futility? Would recording the contract at the county clerk's office have prevented this problem? . . . Julie Tara-Slater, East Hampton, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A Stephen Seldin, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that recording the contract would likely have protected the rights of the letter writer since the title company hired by the eventual purchaser would have considered the recorded contract a cloud on title.</p>
        <p>''And no one is going to close without that being cleared,'' he said.</p>
        <p>However, Mr. Seldin said, contracts are rarely recorded since doing so could create a cloud on the seller's title that does not disappear even if it is the buyer -- rather than the seller -- who defaults. Accordingly, he said, many lawyers include a clause in their contracts that specifically prohibits recording the contract.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seldin said that once property has been conveyed to a ''bonafide purchaser'' -- that is, a buyer who is acting in good faith and who has no knowledge of the prior contract -- the property cannot be reclaimed by the first purchaser. As a result, he said, if the letter writer decided to start a lawsuit against the seller, she would be limited to claiming money damages.</p>
        <p>In this situation, Mr. Seldin said, the amount of damages the letter writer could recover would probably be the difference between the original contract price and the actual value of the property. Since the property was sold to the second purchaser for more than the original contract price, he said, the difference would likely be the amount the letter writer could collect.</p>
        <p>In deciding whether to file suit, the letter writer should consider that in New York, as in most states, the winning party in most civil suits is not entitled to reimbursement from the losing party for legal fees.</p>
        <p>''The letter writer should remember that most lawyers want $3,000 to $5,000 to start a lawsuit,'' Mr. Seldin said. ''And fees can easily reach $10,000 to $20,000 quite quickly.''</p>
        <p>For that reason, he said, rather than becoming embroiled in an expensive lawsuit, most buyers accept the return of any deposit, even though they may be legally and morally right.</p>
        <p>Landlord's Liability On Security Deposits</p>
        <p>Q Is a landlord who acquired a multifamily house by foreclosure liable for security deposits that were paid to the previous landlord? . . . Daniel Sortrich, Yonkers.</p>
        <p>A David Ng, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said that generally speaking, a landlord who acquires a property by foreclosure is liable for security deposits paid to the previous landlord.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ng explained that under the state's General Obligations Law, buyers of buildings with rent-stabilized apartments are always responsible for security deposits paid by the rent-stabilized tenants. For apartments that are not rent-stabilized, he said, the purchaser would be responsible for deposits paid to a prior owner only if the buyer had actual knowledge of the payment of the deposit.</p>
        <p>''There is a presumption in the law that a purchaser has actual knowledge if the deposit was made less than six months before the closing, if it is acknowledged in the tenant's lease, or if the tenant can prove he or she paid it,'' Mr. Ng said.</p>
        <p>Proof of payment can be in the form of a canceled check, a receipt from the prior owner, or reference to the deposit in a prior lease.</p>
        <p>''Most leases will have reference to the security deposit,'' Mr. Ng said.  ''So in my estimation it would be quite difficult for a purchaser to claim not to have knowledge of the deposit.''</p>
        <p>He said that the fact that the property was purchased at foreclosure would have no bearing on the buyer's responsibility for security deposits.  ''The purchaser steps into the shoes of his predecessor,'' Mr. Ng said.</p>
