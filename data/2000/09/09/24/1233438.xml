        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio made no mention of campaign finance reform in his speech accepting the nomination as the Republican Senate candidate on May 30. In eight years in Congress, he was never closely identified with the issue, although he did vote on House bills advocating it. And he barely mentioned the subject until August, after two months of aggressive and fruitful fund-raising showed him catching up to his rival.</p>
        <p>But in the last few weeks, he began talking like a crusader about rooting out soft money, which political parties and interest groups use to allow candidates to skirt legal limits on political fund-raising. It is, Mr. Lazio said, ''the kind of money that has distorted the political process, the kind of money that has kept young people from having more confidence in the political system, the kind of money that is unregulated, unlimited and creates a great deal of cynicism for the public.''</p>
        <p>Six weeks before Election Day, Mr. Lazio's advisers believe they have finally found the issue that gives their candidate a recognizable public profile.</p>
        <p>The advisers, and some outside strategists, say Mr. Lazio's embrace of campaign finance reform has given him a way to stand toe-to-toe with Mrs. Clinton, to put her on the defensive and show, despite his obscurity as a little-known Long Island congressman, he can play in big league politics. There is also a practical side; Mr. Lazio is outraising her in strictly regulated hard-money contributions and stands to benefit financially from an agreement, which the two candidates tentatively reached yesterday.</p>
        <p>But Zenia Mucha, senior adviser to Gov. George E. Pataki, a patron of Mr. Lazio's candidacy, said Mr. Lazio stood to gain even without an agreement. Merely raising the issue plays into Mr. Lazio's line of attack that Mrs. Clinton, any Clinton, cannot be trusted. His advisers say polling shows that a key weakness for Mrs. Clinton is her trustworthiness, not only stemming from association with White House scandals but also from the belief she is in this race more out of self-interest than out of concern about New York.</p>
        <p>But it is also true Mr. Lazio has made his boldest strokes on the issue at times he or his campaign came under scrutiny. His only appearance with Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has championed campaign finance reform, came Aug. 4, a few days after Mr. Lazio's brief appearance at the Republican National Convention fed a round of ''Where's Rick?'' articles (not offered a prime-time speaking role, he turned down an opportunity for a short daytime speech).</p>
        <p>He initiated his soft-money pact at a news conference at Planet Hollywood in Manhattan 10 days later -- the day Mrs. Clinton appeared at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, where Hollywood fund-raisers were held on her behalf.</p>
        <p>And he brandished the pact again a month later at the candidates' first debate, on Sept. 13 in Buffalo, with his actions seen as a pivotal opportunity to make a stamp on voters' minds after Republican murmurs about a lethargic campaign had grown worrisome.</p>
        <p>From that point on, Mr. Lazio has pushed the issue relentlessly, raising it to deflect questions about whether he was too aggressive with Mrs. Clinton during the debate.</p>
        <p>Some analysts believe that whatever the motive, Mr. Lazio has finally demonstrated an ability to stand up to Mrs. Clinton, to cast off questions over whether he belongs in the same arena as the first lady.</p>
        <p>''He is showing he is as big as she is,'' said Rick Wilson, a Republican consultant who advised Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani on his aborted Senate bid. ''He is showing he can take on a national issue and be a national player. He has not been able to score on her with anything else.''</p>
        <p>But few see Mr. Lazio, who stepped into the race after Mr. Giuliani quit, as morphing into Mr. McCain, who reserved judgment on how this issue might affect Mr. Lazio's standing. ''I can't make the argument if this helps or hurts his political campaign, although I am a supporter of his,'' Mr. McCain said Friday in an interview. ''I believe this is the highest-visibility race in two centuries, and it would be great if both candidates say, 'We won't have anything to do with this dirty money.' But whether it helps or hurts Rick, I just don't know.''</p>
        <p>A number of people from Mr. McCain's staff joined Mr. Lazio's campaign, notably Michael Murphy, Mr. Lazio's senior strategist.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Lazio is somewhat of a latecomer to Mr. McCain's signature issue, which played into the senator's maverick style. And although campaign finance reform is closely identified with Mr. McCain, whatever campaign success he garnered stemmed from a variety of factors. Mr. McCain's war record -- he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam -- and his swashbuckling reputation deeply impressed voters, some say more so than his talk of political reform.</p>
        <p>Even absent the style, Mr. Lazio's aides believe the issue can give his campaign some of the verve by pushing the Clinton camp's buttons.</p>
        <p>As Mrs. Clinton addressed editors and reporters Wednesday at a conference in Albany, Mr. Murphy, who had attended Mr. Lazio's speech to the group an hour earlier, sat a couple of rows away. When Mrs. Clinton said she was encouraged by Mr. Lazio's producing signatures from outside groups promising to stay out of the race, Mr. Murphy had a brainstorm. He picked up his cell phone and called his communications director to find out whether Bill Dal Col, Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, would be available to go over to Mrs. Clinton's Manhattan office that night to press for a meeting.</p>
        <p>He was and he did, facing off with Bill de Blasio, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, before a gaggle of reporters.</p>
        <p>Whether the theatrics of confrontation will sway voters, or whether the issue is a touchstone for voters, is debatable.</p>
        <p>Up in Erie County, and many other parts of the upstate battleground, it is improving the economy, not banishing soft money that voters want to hear about, said James E. Campbell, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at Buffalo.</p>
        <p>''Soft money is probably an issue not really highly salient for voters,  but on the other hand it doesn't divide voters,'' Mr. Campbell said.  ''Everybody is for cleaner campaigns. And so it is kind of a no-lose issue for Lazio, and it also provides a chance to bring up the character issue. If Mrs. Clinton is not forthcoming on this, her image will be hurt with swing voters. It's going to be an extremely close election, so anything that puts a dent in Mrs. Clinton's public image is helpful to Lazio.''</p>
