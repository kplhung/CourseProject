        <p>MUCH has been made in the presidential campaign about Vice President Al Gore's stint with the Army in Vietnam, but one striking fact has gone largely unnoted: If elected, Mr. Gore would be the first president in a century to have served as an enlisted man and one of only four ever.</p>
        <p>The presidency, of course, has been replete with men who served their country in uniform -- 27 of the 42 presidents -- but the overwhelming majority did so in the  officer corps.</p>
        <p>There have been 12 generals (Washington, Jackson, Harrison, Taylor, Pierce, Andrew Johnson, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, Harrison and Eisenhower), though no admirals. And there has been a colonel (Theodore Roosevelt), a commander (Lyndon B. Johnson) and a lieutenant commander (Ford), a major (Truman), a captain (Reagan) and three lieutenants (Kennedy, Nixon and Bush).</p>
        <p>But not since William McKinley, who was president from 1897 until his assassination in 1901, has there been a president who served in the humbler ranks.</p>
        <p>McKinley enlisted as a private in the 23rd Regiment of the Ohio Volunteer Infantry during the Civil War. (He went on to receive a battlefield promotion to lieutenant after the Battle of Antietam from a colonel who went on to become a general and a president, Rutherford B. Hayes.)</p>
        <p>In addition to McKinley, only two other presidents had served in the enlisted ranks, according to several presidential reference books.</p>
        <p>James Buchanan served in a company of dragoons -- essentially cavalrymen -- in the defense of Baltimore during the War of 1812. And Abraham Lincoln volunteered as a private when the  Illinois militia mobilized to fight in the Black Hawk Wars in 1832. His company promptly elected him captain, but when that unit stood down, he reenlisted as a private.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Gore, in August 1969, he walked into a draft center in Newark, N.J. and enlisted as a private. And a private he remained through basic training at Fort Dix, a tour at Fort Rucker, and five months as an Army journalist in Vietnam. (He was granted an early discharge to attend divinity school.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, of course, was no ordinary buck private. His father was a senator, and G.I.'s  like him were on what one Army general and Vietnam veteran called ''a watch list,'' a sort of unwritten order to keep them out of trouble.</p>
        <p>Charles C. Moskos, a sociologist at Northwestern University who has long studied the military, said that the dearth of enlistees among the presidents reflected the social and economic backgrounds of the nation's politicians and officers, who with few exceptions were of the educated elite.</p>
        <p>''The typical military experience is to be an enlisted man,'' he said. ''It has not been shared by our presidents.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's campaign has made the most of his military record, which starkly contrasts to the lack of service by President Clinton, but it remains to be seen how much it will help him on Election Day.</p>
        <p>His opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, scores higher in the polls on military matters, and in recent years people in uniform, particularly in the officer corps, have tilted increasingly toward the Republican Party. The tradition in which the majority usually considered themselves independent is weakening, a trend that has raised concerns about the increasing politicization of the military.</p>
        <p>A survey last year of up and coming officers found that 64 percent identified themselves as Republicans, compared to only 8 percent who were Democrats.</p>
        <p>As if to underscore the point, an array of veterans, including senior officers who served under Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, last week endorsed Mr. Bush, who served as a fighter pilot in the Texas National Guard during the Vietnam War and was, for the record, a lieutenant.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 1, 2000, Sunday  Because of an editing error, an article last week about the military service of United States presidents included an incomplete list of those who served as officers. James Monroe was a lieutenant colonel under George Washington, John Tyler a captain in the Virginia militia, and Jimmy Carter a lieutenant in the Navy. Millard Fillmore served as a major in the New York Home Guard during the Civil War, but only after he left the presidency.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the number of American presidents. Because Grover Cleveland's two terms were nonconsecutive, there have been 42 presidencies, but only 41 presidents.</p>
