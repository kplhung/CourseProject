        <p>IT used to be hard for opera fans to find recordings of historic live performances on commercial labels. No longer. As record companies continue to flood the market, live opera recordings from the past turn up in all the larger record stores. Some hold historical interest for more than musical reasons: a recently issued recording of Wilhelm Furtwangler conducting Wagner's ''Meistersinger von Nurnberg'' at the Bayreuth Festival in 1943 on the Arkadia label, for example, a fascinating relic of Nazi Germany. Others are nothing special, just routine nights at important opera houses that record companies stumble on and release, hoping that susceptible buffs will buy them anyway.</p>
        <p>In some cases the copyrights to these recordings have been properly obtained and paid for. More often these releases are ''pirated,'' obtained illegally, though the injured individuals are usually long gone, and the ripped-off opera companies have more pressing claims on their budgets than fighting legal battles in copyright court.</p>

        <p>IT used to be hard for opera fans to find recordings of historic live performances on commercial labels. No longer. As record companies continue to flood the market, live opera recordings from the past turn up in all the larger record stores. Some hold historical interest for more than musical reasons: a recently issued recording of Wilhelm Furtwangler conducting Wagner's ''Meistersinger von Nurnberg'' at the Bayreuth Festival in 1943 on the Arkadia label, for example, a fascinating relic of Nazi Germany. Others are nothing special, just routine nights at important opera houses that record companies stumble on and release, hoping that susceptible buffs will buy them anyway.</p>
        <p>In some cases the copyrights to these recordings have been properly obtained and paid for. More often these releases are ''pirated,'' obtained illegally, though the injured individuals are usually long gone, and the ripped-off opera companies have more pressing claims on their budgets than fighting legal battles in copyright court.</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan Opera is an exception. The company's legal department has vigorously enforced the copyright laws protecting recordings of performances at the house, at least in the United States, where laws are stricter than in Europe. So you seldom come across a pirated recording of a Met performance in an American store.</p>
        <p>This is why the Met's own series of historic recordings has been so valuable. Since 1974 the company has released 23 recordings of historic radio broadcasts in deluxe boxed sets with extensive program notes, essays, biographies of the singers and pictorial histories of all productions of the opera at the Met. The latest release is a lovely performance of Strauss's ''Rosenkavalier'' from Feb. 24, 1951, conducted by Fritz Reiner, with a splendid cast headed by Eleanor Steber as the Marschallin: apparently the only complete recording of this beloved American artist in that touchstone role.</p>
        <p>These albums are limited-edition collector's items, available only by special order from the Met (212-362-6000). Just 2,500 copies of each set are produced. Technically, they are not for sale, but are sent as gifts to anyone contributing $150 or more to the Metropolitan Opera Fund. All those with a potential stake in the project have waived their fees: the artists, their families and heirs, the Met orchestra and chorus, the local musicians' union and the television and radio union. So the recordings are scrupulously legal. And this performance of ''Der Rosenkavalier'' is an important addition to the discography.</p>
        <p>There are several classic studio recordings of Strauss's most popular opera, and this live account is not likely to displace them. But it is a distinguished performance. In October 1949, the Met opened its season for the first time with ''Der Rosenkavalier,'' and Steber moved from the role of Sophie to that of the Marschallin. The reviews were admiring but qualified. Olin Downes in The New York Times praised the tenderness and charm of Steber's singing but said it lacked ''the color, the sensuousness, the outbursts of passion and of vain regrets.''</p>
        <p>But Steber's conception of the role grew quickly. The 1951 performance captured here is still not as impassioned and overtly emotional as some portrayals. Yet the restraint and dignity are refreshing and deeply moving. And Steber's singing is typically sumptuous, with lovely pianissimo passages, effortlessly sustained high notes and rich, full sound in long lyrical phrases. Though she performed the role only 24 times with the Met, 14 times at the house and 10 on tour, many Steber connoisseurs consider this role among her most important.</p>
        <p>On the day of this broadcast the acclaimed American mezzo-soprano Rise Stevens was scheduled to sing Octavian, one of her favorite roles. Forced by illness to withdraw, she was replaced by Jarmila Novotna, the great Czech soprano. The character is an adolescent, lovesick count, who is 100 percent hormones. Novotna was 47 at the time, and she sounds it. Her voice is husky and mature. Still, this is an admirable and sensitive portrayal.</p>
        <p>Sophie, the other impetuous adolescent in the story, is sung by another veteran, the German lyric soprano Erna Berger, then 50. Yet her singing is wonderfully youthful and fresh. Fritz Krenn, the Austrian bass who plays Baron Ochs, was first encouraged to sing the role by Strauss himself. It became one of his great achievements. By the time of this Met performance Krenn was 63, and his voice sounds patchy and worn. Still, he brings great character and stylistic authority to his portrayal.</p>
        <p>Steber's Marschallin aside, admirers of ''Der Rosenkavalier'' will want this recording for the conducting of Reiner. The performance offers a revealing glimpse of the Met orchestra in its workaday mode during that period, just one year into Rudolf Bing's tenure as manager. The playing is careless here and there. It makes clearer the achievement of James Levine, who over the last quarter-century has turned the orchestra into a wonder of technical skill and glorious sound. But Reiner conducts a fleet, supple and thoroughly engaging performance, bringing shape and sweep to the phrasing, without a trace of self-conscious effort. It is all natural, buoyant and beautiful. And he allows the bittersweet moments to linger just enough. The interpretation is never indulgent or sentimental.</p>
        <p>By now, all 2,500 copies of some exciting releases in the Met's historic broadcast series have been scooped up: a classic performance of Wagner's ''Walkure'' from 1944, for example, with Lauritz Melchior as Siegmund, Rose Bampton as Sieglinde, Helen Traubel as Brunnhilde and Herbert Janssen as Wotan, with George Szell conducting. So unless the Met reissues them, this recording and others are gone. Several remarkable albums from the series, like a performance of Puccini's ''Manon Lescaut'' from 1949, are still available.</p>
        <p>The ''Manon Lescaut'' performance was just one of those times when everything went right and everyone was at his or her best. The legendary tenor Jussi Bjoerling, as Des Grieux, is in stupendous voice. His singing is ardent, vibrant, clarion and, where called for, meltingly expressive. But the surprise, for some, will be the performance of the soprano Dorothy Kirsten in the title role. Sadly, Kirsten was taken for granted at the Met, as were other American singers during the 1940's and 50's. Hers was not a glamour voice. She was not Renata Tebaldi. But she had a lovely, warm and quite full sound, solid technique, affecting artistry and keen dramatic instincts. She was also a strikingly handsome woman. Today she would have a major Met career.</p>
        <p>The supporting cast is strong, especially Giuseppe Valdengo as Le scaut. Giuseppe Antonicelli conducts an idiomatic performance.</p>
        <p>There is also an electrifying recording of Puccini's ''Turandot'' from 1961, with Birgit Nilsson in the title role and Franco Corelli as Calaf, conducted by Leopold Stokowski. This was one of Ms. Nilsson's signature roles, and her 1959 studio recording for RCA Victor, with Bjoer ling as Calaf, is justly prized. But she sings here with an extra degree of spontaneity and intensity that was very likely provoked by her tenor.</p>
        <p>During his day, Mr. Corelli was criticized for his often hammy singing. He was a famously lusty tenor, and no score marking, let alone a mere conductor, was going to limit how long he held his ringing high notes. Today, when we lack tenors with his kind of vocal charisma, it is exciting to hear someone with such an enormous, vibrant voice unleash it so confidently. He and Ms. Nilsson, who appeared together often in this opera, had a love-hate partnership. In their final scene they engage in some pretty competitive singing.</p>
        <p>Anna Moffo portrays Liu. This gifted American soprano's prime did not last long, but the Met performance captures her in the midst of it. The bass Bonaldo Giaiotti is a fine Timur. No doubt the other reason Ms. Nilsson and the cast sing with such vigor is Stokowski, who conducts with bold dramatic pacing and a keen ear for orchestral color.</p>
        <p>Among the other albums still obtainable are an exceptional recording of a 1963 broadcast of Bellini's ''Sonnambula'' with Joan Sutherland and Nicolai Gedda, conducted by Silvio Varviso, and a 1946 recording of Ponchielli's ''Gioconda'' with a glittery cast, including Zinka Milanov, Ms. Stevens, Richard Tucker and Leonard Warren.</p>
        <p>Of course, when these Met releases sell out, the performances may still be available for determined collectors undeterred by legal technicalities. Though the Met does a fairly thorough job of keeping pirated Met recordings off the American market, it is less diligent in Europe, as its legal department readily admits. In Europe you can easily find pirated recordings of Met performances. E-commerce has made it much easier for buyers to find them and, consequently, much harder for companies to crack down on illegal sales. A couple of Web sites offer lengthy lists of recordings of Met broadcasts that have even been released on CD, both complete operas and excerpts, with sound quality ranging from good to wretched. One Web site has nearly 200 items.</p>
        <p>Though many of these pirated recordings are not currently available, quite a few are. This is just one matter that will have to be straightened out as lawyers in the field of intellectual property rights undertake the enormous task of totally revamping copyright laws, which are so outdated that they barely take into account the photocopy machine, let alone the Internet.</p>
        <p>For now, the $150 cost to obtain the newly issued ''Rosenkavalier'' and other historic Met performances may seem a lot. But contributors can at least rest assured that they are acquiring the only legal recordings of live Met broadcasts.</p>
