        <p>FOR high school juniors, summer vacation should be something special, the last of the truly carefree times before senior year and the intrusion of college or the real world. A time for fun and laughter.</p>
        <p>For Sara Gonzalez, Lakeland High's standout field hockey forward, this has been a time of work and pain, when determination left no room for tears and pessimism.</p>
        <p>It started in the spring. ''April 3,'' Sara said with conviction. ''It was the first varsity soccer game of the season. The field was wet. A girl on the other team made a move and I turned to get to her.''</p>
        <p>The left knee turned. The left foot and cleat stayed planted in the soft turf.</p>
        <p>''I heard something pop,'' she said. ''I thought I'd broken my kneecap. I told the coach to call the ambulance.''</p>
        <p>Early X-rays showed nothing torn, but the next day, a magnetic resonance imaging exam brought the bad news. The anterior cruciate ligament -- the A.C.L. which stabilizes the knee -- was torn, irreparably. The miniscus -- the soft cartilage cushioning the kneecap -- had a tear, not irreparable.</p>
        <p>''The doctor said it was bad,'' Sara recalled. ''That I'd have to work hard but I could come back.''</p>
        <p>Sara had been one of the field hockey standouts in New York State, the leader of the Hudson Valley champions in the Empire State Games, the high scorer (16 goals, 9 assists) on a Class B Section 1 state championship Lakeland team as a junior.</p>
        <p>But the summer would be lost forever, for fun and for cementing college scholarships.</p>
        <p>''The timing couldn't have been worse,'' Lakeland's coach, Sharon Sarsen, said. ''The summer before senior year is critical for college recruiting. Sara's greatest skill is her creativity with the ball. You never know what she's going to do. Her stick skills are as good as anyone in the state, and many of the college coaches would not get to see them. She missed those events where college coaches look at all the top players.''</p>
        <p>Instead there were two-hour workouts three times a week.</p>
        <p>''The doctor said I would have to work hard,'' Sara said, ''but that didn't scare me.  I've always worked hard.''</p>
        <p>Courtney Collins, another Lakeland star, agreed. ''At first I was very nervous for her,'' she said. ''But I knew no one would work harder.''</p>
        <p>The conditioning started even before the April 25 surgery in which a kneecap tendon was transplanted to replace the A.C.L., and the miniscus was sewn. Soon the workouts were up to two hours.</p>
        <p>''They tied a ligament from elsewhere with screws and it had to be taught to act like an A.C.L.,'' she explained. ''First there were 10 minutes on the bike -- that wasn't too bad once the swelling from the operation went down -- then 10 minutes running uphill on a treadmill, 5 minutes forward and 5 minutes back. Then 8 minutes on the Nordic track followed by balancing exercises with ankle tubing. Next was working with weights, lifting the leg. And, of course, stool pulls.''</p>
        <p>In that innocent-sounding exercise, one puts the healthy leg on the stool side bar -- and pulls oneself across the floor with the other leg. Then pushes backward to the original position. Big football players have been reduced to tears. This 5-foot-4, 135-pound girl was not.</p>
        <p>''Next came 15 minutes on the Stairmaster,'' Sara said. ''And leg presses, and ways to work on hip strength and a computerized bending and straightening the leg. And wall slides, and more.''</p>
        <p>Sara did it all every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. ''And,'' she said, ''I went to my prom with my leg in a brace under my dress.''</p>
        <p>Lakeland's field hockey practice started on Aug. 21. Sara, wearing a lightweight brace made of plastic, was on the field.</p>
        <p>Coach Sarsen said, ''She was ready to go.''</p>
        <p>''She's just as dangerous as ever on the field,'' the coach said. ''I have no problem with her getting back to 100 percent. Her mobility isn't there quite yet, but she's very close.''</p>
        <p>She has arranged for Sara to play on a Saratoga Springs team in the National Hockey Festival in November so that college coaches can see her. ''She definitely could play at the Division I level,'' Ms. Sarsen said. ''And she's a 90-plus student.''</p>
        <p>Lakeland opened its season two weeks ago with a tight, 2-0 tournament triumph over a tough J.F.K. squad. A corner shot by Sara set up the first goal with 17 minutes to go in the first half. She then assisted on a second-half goal.</p>
        <p>In the next game, Sara scored a goal. Then, last weekend, she led Lakeland to the Briarcliff Invitation championship, scoring in overtime to win the semifinal and scoring three goals in the final and walking off with most valuable player honors.</p>
        <p>''I'm with her on the field every day,'' Courtney said, ''and I think she's even better than last year.''</p>
