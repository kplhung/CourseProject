        <p>IN film after film, the diva's role is not an easy one. She may portray a countess or a woman of the people, be lodged in a chateau or a fisherman's shack, appear covered in furs, a Neapolitan shawl or a nun's habit; but her characters are always haunted by terrible secrets and fearful of ghosts from the past. With her arabesque gestures and her gaze turned toward heaven, she recalls the dark-eyed heroines of 19th-century melodrama; yet she also plays the New Woman, who smokes cigarettes, wears pants, flirts with men and rides in hot-air balloons. The camera loves her beauty, but on screen her charms may draw unwanted attentions, perpetual suspicions and even a jealous lover's knife.</p>
        <p>The diva transforms suffering into cinematic spectacle. As a lady, she drips with jewels, but in dreams she hears the wailing of the child she abandoned years ago; as a laundress, she toils ceaselessly, but with a faraway look she recalls the aristocrat who once toyed with her. The vamps she portrays are never entirely heartless, and they usually atone for their wanton behavior with self-immolation. Her solitary magnificence afflicts her, even as it cloaks her in an air of mystery. She's not just another pretty face; whether femme fatale or mater dolorosa, she seems to embody the pleasures and torments of an entire people.</p>

        <p>The diva transforms suffering into cinematic spectacle. As a lady, she drips with jewels, but in dreams she hears the wailing of the child she abandoned years ago; as a laundress, she toils ceaselessly, but with a faraway look she recalls the aristocrat who once toyed with her. The vamps she portrays are never entirely heartless, and they usually atone for their wanton behavior with self-immolation. Her solitary magnificence afflicts her, even as it cloaks her in an air of mystery. She's not just another pretty face; whether femme fatale or mater dolorosa, she seems to embody the pleasures and torments of an entire people.</p>
        <p>''Passion and Defiance: Silent Divas of Italian Cinema,'' a series of 15 rare silent films, opens today at the Walter Reade Theater and runs through Oct. 6, as part of the New York Film Festival. Francesca Bertini, Lyda Borelli, Pina Menichelli and other divas may be unknown to all but film historians and a few octogenarian cinephiles. But their images once captivated a nation with fantasies of feminine triumph and victimization, creating larger-than-life personalities to coincide with the birth of a new medium.</p>
        <p>Divas and divisimo (the cinematic culture that surrounded them) flourished in the chaos of Italy's regionally based film industry between 1910 and 1920. These were years of enormous Italian migration to the United States and Latin America and of imperialist expansion, with Italy's conquest of Libya.</p>
        <p>The diva's exotic accouterments and otherworldly aura fed the public hunger for images of far-off places. A curious hybrid of 19th-century manners, fin-de-siecle decadence and 20th-century technology, she crystallized the anxieties of a newly unified republic, reluctantly confronting the challenges of modernity.</p>
        <p>Diva means goddess in Italian. The term comes from the world of opera; Italian film divas inherited the mantle from Puccini's prima donnas, from theatrical personalities like the ''divine'' Sarah Bernhardt and from Scandinavian screen idols like the Danish actress Asta Nielsen.</p>
        <p>What distinguishes a diva from a star? For Angela Dalle Vacche, the co-curator of this series with Gian Luca Farinelli, it's a matter of mystical exaltation. ''Something happens to certain stars -- Greta Garbo, Louise Brooks, Marlene Dietrich,'' she said by telephone from Atlanta, where she teaches film studies at Emory University. ''Whether in their careers or physiognomies, in the alchemy between their faces and the screen or in the kind of directors they choose work with, and from a mortal, starlike quality, they escalate into an essential, transcendental, divine sphere.''</p>
        <p>The diva acts, but she doesn't really need to; her mere presence guarantees dramatic consequences. Scaling cinematic peaks of rapture and anguish, she rises to the ranks of saints and martyrs. It's no accident, Ms. Dalle Vacche points out, that divas blossomed in a culture that also gave us Bernini's sculpture of Saint Teresa in ecstasy. This was a time when Italian women could neither vote nor divorce. Some supplemented their meager incomes as laundresses or teachers with prostitution. For these and others, the divas provided dreams of release, of freedom and expiation.</p>
        <p>In these films, the diva usually plays the daughter of a single parent, or an orphan. Her character is inevitably disappointed in love by a man who is either overly possessive or indolently prey to his mother's machinations; an illegitimate child is frequently the fruit of their affair.</p>
        <p>Whether an aristocrat, an adventuress or a self-made woman, she comes accompanied with ropes of pearls, day dresses trimmed with monkey fur, enormous Russian sables, evening gowns by Worth and Poiret and a Cleopatra costume, to be worn at masked balls where she performs Orientalist dances a la Loie Fuller. Her natural habitat appears to be a palace filled with rococo furniture, though if she falls in with bad company (like the marvelously perverse Pina Menichelli in ''Storia di una Donna'') she may land in an assassins' den decorated with chinoiserie and intricate  screens modeled on the Alhambra.</p>
        <p>Yet she is just as likely to be found in humble circumstances. Francesca Bertini plays the daughter of a poor fisherman in the romantic melodrama ''Assunta Spina,'' with the Bay of Naples as her backdrop and her sole accessory a large fringed shawl, which she transforms into a supremely expressive instrument. The great Italian theater actress Eleonora Duse, making her first and only film appearance at age 59, in ''Cenere,'' chose to portray an illiterate mother living in a stone hut in Sardinia, deprived of all possessions except a dark cloak and her regal dignity.</p>
        <p>THE divas were among the first creations of the modern publicity mill. Lyda Borelli's influence on fashion was so pervasive that the term ''borellisimo'' developed to describe young women who dieted to emulate her sinuous form or adopted her mannerisms, sighing and staring off into the distance with their chins in their hands.</p>
        <p>Publicly these actresses maintained a delicate balance between scandal and propriety. How could it be otherwise? Audiences tended to conflate Borelli with the women she portrayed: wildly aggressive creatures caught in society's web. In ''Fiore di Male,'' she plays a prostitute who reforms with the help of an elderly count and becomes the head of her own fashion empire, finally inheriting his wealth and title; yet she dies at the hand of the son she abandoned in infancy. In ''Malombra,'' she's a noble woman who becomes possessed by the ghost of a vengeful ancestor and murders both her uncle and fiance.</p>
        <p>In ''Rhapsodia Satanica'' (1917), as an aging aristocrat, she bargains with the devil, who promises to restore her youth if she will renounce love. He emerges from a tableau above her sofa, sporting a manifestly fake nose and painted eyebrows. The canvas, the devil and the miraculously rejuvenated woman all shimmer with hand-tinted color, each one identified with that potentially sinful new medium that can make the hourglass run backward and preserve a diva's beauty forever.</p>
        <p>Traditional Italian film historians tended to blame the divas' imperious manners and  ruinous salaries for hastening their own demise and the Italian film industry's crisis in the 1920's. But that sounds like the plot of a diva film. Certainly Italian Fascism, with its ideology of feminine subservience, found the diva no longer serviceable.</p>
        <p>Did she expire from chagrin on the coffin of her only son, like Leda Gys in ''Figli di Nessuno''? Did she commit suicide by electrocution, like Italia Almirante Manzini in ''L'Inamorata''? More likely, she gave a toss of her tresses, threw her pearls over one shoulder and stepped lightly into history. Luckily, she left behind these films, now marvelously restored, for all to see.</p>
