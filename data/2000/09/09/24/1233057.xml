        <p>TWO years ago, Americans arriving in Paris or Brussels or Frankfurt would routinely be shocked at the high cost of nearly everything: dreary hotels that cost nearly $200 a night; $10 to develop a roll of film; and clothes that often cost 50 percent more than in the United States.</p>
        <p>But thanks to the seemingly endless decline of the euro, the common currency adopted by 12 European countries, things here are cheaper in dollars than they have been in years. The euro has lost more than 25 percent of its value against the dollar since its launch in January 1999, and it has repeatedly defied expert predictions that it was ripe for a rebound.</p>
        <p>From its opening value of about $1.17, the euro has fallen to one record low after another, and was down to 85 cents early last week. Most of this is invisible to ordinary consumers, who will not be able to use euro bills and coins until 2002.</p>
        <p>But the decline is very real, because national currencies like the French franc and Italian lira are locked to the euro and mirror its movements exactly.</p>
        <p>On balance, the euro's decline translates into a huge discount for American travelers in Europe because their dollars are worth so much more. Major airlines report that their trans-Atlantic flights were packed solid throughout the peak vacation period as Americans appear to have jumped at the prospect of cheaper prices (in dollars) from Spain to Finland.</p>
        <p>''For European tourism, it is the best we have had in years,'' said Walter Leu, executive director of the European Travel Commission in Brussels, an umbrella group of national travel organizations from Europe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leu estimated that 12 million Americans would visit Europe this year and spend about $25 billion. That is a 6 percent increase in the number of travelers and a 10 percent increase in the amount of money they are spending, compared with last year.</p>
        <p>But as has become clear in the last few weeks, there is no such thing as a purely ''good'' exchange rate, even for American tourists. Thanks in part to the euro's weakness, the price of oil has climbed even more sharply in Europe than in the United States and led to protests that made gasoline hard to find in parts of England, France and Belgium.</p>
        <p>Soaring gasoline prices caused widespread anger in the United States, too, of course. But the European problem was different in two big ways.</p>
        <p>The first difference is that oil is priced and paid for in dollars on world markets. So when the euro declined at the same time that oil prices were surging, Europeans were faced with a compounded price increase because their currency bought far fewer dollars than before.</p>
        <p>The second big difference is taxes. Across Europe, including Britain, gasoline taxes account for as much as 75 percent of the price that consumers pay. That is why Britain, which did not adopt the euro and has not seen the pound decline as much against the dollar, nevertheless produced the angriest gasoline protests in Europe.</p>
        <p>But the protests are dying down, as governments have vowed to provide at least some relief to truckers and other key groups. Assuming the blockades continue to be disbanded, gas station supplies should return to normal.</p>
        <p>To be sure, airline prices are starting to climb in Europe as a result of higher jet-fuel prices. KLM, the Dutch airline, recently said it would raise prices by 4 percent to offset higher fuel prices. But most of the big airlines have held back so far, in part because they are under increasingly intense pressure from scores of new budget-priced airlines.</p>
        <p>For all kinds of products, prices vary considerably within Europe. Great Britain is more expensive than most parts of the United States, because the British pound is much stronger than the euro and because London is in the midst of a long-running economic boom as a financial center. Thanks to phenomenal economic growth for the last five years, Ireland has also experienced substantial inflation and is expensive, even though it is part of the Euro zone.</p>
        <p>The big question is whether the euro will recover any time soon. Eighteen months ago, most economists were predicting that the euro would settle at well above $1.10. Now, few think it will get anywhere close to parity with the dollar in the next year, and some predict it will sink as low as 80 cents.</p>
        <p>But given how wrong the expert predictions have been so far, anything is possible.</p>
