        <p>CIVIL WARRIORS</p>
        <p>The Legal Siege on</p>
        <p>the Tobacco Industry.</p>
        <p>By Dan Zegart.</p>
        <p>358 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Delacorte Press. $25.95.</p>
        <p>When his mother was dying from emphysema in 1984, the product liability lawyer Ronald Motley made a promise to her. ''I'm going to get 'em, Mom,'' he said, referring to the tobacco companies. ''I swear to you before God, if it's the last thing I do, I'll get 'em.'' And, as we know, he did. In late 1998, when a multistate settlement agreement was finally concluded, the tobacco industry pledged to pay the 50 states more than $200 billion for the increased Medicaid costs attributed to smoking-related diseases. (The companies promptly raised their prices nearly 26 percent to enable them to pass along this new tariff to their addicted customers.) Shortly after the first version of the settlement was concluded, Dan Zegart reports in ''Civil Warriors,'' one of the many beautiful female paralegals and lawyers Motley hires to assist him with his public-spirited work saluted her employer, cooing, ''Your mom's smiling down at you right now.''</p>
        <p>But there have always been troublesome knots in the logic behind the litigation that Motley led, which is scheduled to earn his small firm in Charleston, S.C., more than $1 billion in fees. The litigation did not -- and was never intended to -- shut down the tobacco companies. On the contrary, for the companies to make good on the new debts Motley and his numerous co-counsels have helped impose upon them, they must continue to sell cigarettes to people like Motley's mother, who will presumably still become addicted to them and who will still eventually die horrible deaths from smoking-related illnesses. (In May, according to Legal Times, Motley's partner Joe Rice and co-counsel Richard Scruggs split from the rest of the plaintiffs' bar and sided with the tobacco companies. In July, Motley's former colleagues and the industry won passage of a Florida law that enabled the companies to stay out of bankruptcy after they were hit, as anticipated, with a $144.8 billion punitive damages verdict in a Miami suit brought by rival anti-smoking lawyers. Scruggs explained to Legal Times that he didn't want the tobacco companies to go bankrupt, because ''it kills the goose, so to speak.'')</p>
        <p>If the reader is looking for a book that grapples with ambiguities like these, ''Civil Warriors'' is not it. Zegart, a freelance journalist, generally preaches to the choir, taking it as a given that Motley earned his colossal payday by doing God's work. If, on the other hand, the reader is looking for a highly readable overview of the sprawling tobacco litigation, told briskly, comprehensively and comprehensibly by an excellent storyteller, then ''Civil Warriors'' is a good pick. Zegart succeeds in his ambitious goal of condensing the details of seven litigations, including three trials, into a single strong narrative populated by vivid characters. Along the way he provides numerous surprising portraits, including that of a decent but apparently gullible Harvard scientist, Gary Huber, who discovers, after a decade of industry-financed research, that he had been ruthlessly manipulated by industry lawyers whom he viewed as friends -- in some instances performing experiments that the industry had already secretly performed. Zegart also provides a rare, provocative depiction of David Hardy, who until his death in 1976 was the industry's chief outside lawyer. Knowing that he was dying, Zegart says, Hardy told Huber: ''I bought 'em an extra 20 or 30 years. . . . But you know, it's temporary. One of these days, we're going to have to pay up.''</p>
        <p>But while Zegart was well placed to tell Motley's story -- he spent six years traveling with him as a de facto member of his team -- he was poorly placed to tell it objectively. (He calls Hardy a ''latter-day Rasputin,'' while characterizing Motley's first wife's feelings this way: ''The problem with Ron was you loved him even when you wanted to hate him.'') I frequently wished that ''Civil Warriors'' could have been written by a Connie Bruck or a Janet Malcolm or a Marshall Frady -- someone less smitten by his subject and more brutally loyal to the reader.</p>
