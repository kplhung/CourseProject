        <p>Steve Nash was dribbling away as the shot clock wound down, taking care of the basketball and -- as ridiculous as it sounds -- unsure whether to preserve an 18-point loss to Russia.</p>
        <p>Nash, the Canadian point guard, had at times been spectacular over the last week, directing his team, the most surprising of the Olympic tournament, to three straight victories before today's 77-59 loss. In the last 30 seconds at the Dome in Olympic Park, he dribbled maybe 10 seconds off the shot clock before looking over at the bench for instruction.</p>
        <p>His coaching staff told Nash to run a play, but the Canadians were unsure whether they needed to avoid losing by more than 18 points, to maintain a point-differential advantage over Australia for medal-round seeding purposes.</p>
        <p>The goal for Russia (2-2), Canada (3-1) and Australia (2-2) was to avoid a quarterfinal matchup with the United States, which routed New Zealand, 102-56, today. With the possibility they all might finish 3-2 in preliminary play, the Canadians at least needed the tiebreaker over Australia.</p>
        <p>But then something inexplicable happened, something Team Canada may regret for four years. Moments after Coach Jay Triano explained to the news media that the rules needed to be changed to avoid point-shaving and admitted his players did not attack the basket in the final moments, new math came to the Sydney Games.</p>
        <p>The Canadians apparently misunderstood the rules. Under the regulations of FIBA, basketball's international governing body, goal-average, and not point differential, is used as the tiebreaker when three teams are knotted. A team's points against the other two teams are divided by the opposition's points, to arrive at a goal average.</p>
        <p>Russia won out, with a 1.10447 average. Australia nipped Canada by the slimmest of percentages, 0.9593 to 0.9581. Should the three teams wind up with identical records, the Canadians will take no solace in this brutal statistic: One point would have put them ahead of Australia. A free throw. One point.</p>
        <p>''It's a little bit weird to find that out after the game,'' John Lee, the Canadian team trainer, said. ''If we had just made one free throw, there would be no controversy.''</p>
        <p>The Canadians still have a chance to win Group B if they can upset unbeaten Yugoslavia on Monday or if Australia is upset by Spain. But should all three teams finish 3-2, Nash and his teammates will forever bemoan the confusing end to tonight's game. The way the Yugoslavians have been playing, an upset by Spain over Australia, which held off Angola, 86-75, is more plausible.</p>
        <p>The United States men cruised past New Zealand to move to 4-0 in this tournament. Vince Carter dunked often, ending with 18 points. Allan Houston contributed 17 points, burying four of the five 3-pointers he attempted.</p>
        <p>Sean Marks, who played in the National Basketball Association for two seasons with Toronto, led New Zealand with 10 points. Unlike some of the more unfriendly competitions between the United States men and their opponents here, a genuine respect between the teams developed.</p>
        <p>At the end of the game, the New Zealanders paid the Americans the ultimate form of homage in their sporting culture. Putting their hands on their knees in the center of the court and bending down slightly, they suddenly broke into the Haka, a legendary war dance used by the Maori people to respect to their opponents.</p>
        <p>Carter, Kevin Garnett and the American players hugged and high-fived the New Zealand players after their baritone chant and dance was complete. The crowd of 8,392 erupted as the two teams walked off together toward the locker room. ''I didn't know what they were doing,'' Garnett began, ''but I thought it was pretty cool. They asked for the floor and for us to turn around. So I just sat back and watched.''</p>
        <p>The United States men played for the first time without Alonzo Mourning, who left Sydney on Friday to return home to Miami for the birth of his daughter. Flying commercial to Los Angeles, Mourning was met at the airport by a charter jet belonging to Micky Arison, the Miami Heat owner.</p>
        <p>He arrived at the Miami hospital 17 minutes before his wife, Tracy Wilson-Mourning, gave birth to the couple's daughter, Myka Sydney. Mourning is expected to return to Sydney on Monday night and play in the medal-round games, completing a round trip of 18,660 miles.</p>
        <p>Back in the Olympic Village, the Canadians were ruing their misfortune.</p>
        <p>In the final six minutes against Russia, they scored only five points. Todd MacCulloch missed a free throw with 1:04 left. Nash missed a field goal with 1:43 remaining. And then came the final seconds, when Nash, the Dallas Mavericks' point guard, may have unknowingly dribbled Canada's medal chances away.</p>
        <p>One point: possibly the difference between leaving with a medal and being run off the floor by Team USA in the quarterfinals.</p>
