        <p>HUGO CHAVEZ spent his first 18 months as president of Venezuela  consolidating his power on the domestic front. Now, with the price of oil nearing $40 a barrel and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries scheduled to gather here this week for a conference of its heads of state, he is about to step out onto the world stage in a big way.</p>
        <p>For those unfamiliar with Venezuela's president, a 46-year-old former paratrooper who in 1992 led an unsuccessful coup attempt, the experience promises to be overwhelming. When it comes to international relations, Mr. Chavez is a whirlwind of ideas, plans and visions (as he is with every other subject that interests him), and many of these are intended to reshape the world order. This leaves him often critical of or even hostile to American positions.</p>
        <p>''Venezuela is just too small for him,'' said Michael Shifter, senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy analysis group. ''He fancies himself as a regional and hemispheric leader, wants to play a major role on the global stage, and is testing the limits of how far he can go in terms of pushing his ideas and showing off his posture in global politics.''</p>
        <p>Such ambitions may seem messianic and way out of proportion in a country of modest size and huge economic and social problems. But Venezuela has twice as many people as Cuba, and Mr. Chavez has a pair of arrows in his quiver that his friend and mentor Fidel Castro could never claim: the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East and a long history as a main supplier of gasoline and heating oil to the United States.</p>
        <p>That situation of mutual dependence gives Venezuela considerable leverage in its dealings with the United States, and Mr. Chavez, by arranging to have his energy minister named the president of OPEC, has been skillful in using oil as an instrument of foreign policy. As befits a former soldier, his own view of the world and how it should be shaped is strongly colored by geopolitical and strategic considerations.</p>
        <p>''The 20th century was a bipolar century, but the 21st is not going to be unipolar,'' he vowed in a speech here in August. ''The 21st century should be multipolar, and we all ought to push for the development of such a world. So long live a united Asia, a united Africa, a united Europe.''</p>
        <p>On this, as in several other areas, Mr. Chavez's views are similar to those of one of his early advisers, a neo-fascist Argentine theorist named Norberto Ceresole, who contends that Latin America must forge alliances with the Middle East and Asia to counterbalance the power of the United States and what he (but not Mr. Chavez) calls ''the Jewish financial mafia.'' In its opposition to American hegemony, this view  has something in common with those of  countries like France and above all China, with whom Mr. Chavez has sought closer ties.</p>
        <p>''Soviet power has collapsed, but that does not mean that neoliberal capitalism has to be the model followed by the peoples of the West,'' he said during a visit to Beijing last fall. ''If only for that reason, we invite China to keep its flag flying, because this world cannot be run by a universal police force that seeks to control everything.''</p>
        <p>In more concrete terms, Mr. Chavez believes that ''his mission in the world is to restore some sort of equilibrium that favors less developed countries,'' said Janet Kelly, a professor at the Institute of Higher Administrative Studies in Caracas who is working on a book about Venezuelan-American relations. ''When you combine that with his liking of the center stage, it means he is going to be acting constantly to promote any movement in the world that goes against what he would perceive as the U.S.-dominated agenda.''</p>
        <p>One key to pursuing that goal is closer ties with what he calls ''our 10 partners, friends and brothers in OPEC.'' In August, Mr. Chavez visited all the OPEC countries to invite their leaders to the summit meeting this week, raising hackles in Washington when he became the first head of state to call on Saddam Hussein in Baghdad since the gulf war and when, during a stop in Libya, he described Muammar el-Qaddafi as his ally.</p>
        <p>''In geopolitical terms, the OPEC tour was masterful,'' said Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere Program at Johns Hopkins University. ''It demonstrated that Venezuela was not just a Latin American backwater.'' He added that while the State Department may have complained about the Iraq trip, ''more people in the third world now know about Chavez than they do about any other Latin American leader except Fidel Castro.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez's relationship with the Cuban leader is complex. While he said last year that Venezuela and Cuba are swimming together ''towards the same sea of happiness and of real social justice and peace,'' he also seems to realize that Mr. Castro's star has faded, leaving a vacuum that he, with all his eloquence, exuberance and personal warmth, can perhaps fill.</p>
        <p>''There is admiration for Fidel, but it is linked not so much to Cuba's domestic system, which I do not think Chavez is interested in trying out, as it is adopting some of Fidel's style, such as the David against Goliath stance and the sense of humor that galls the other side,'' Dr. Kelly said. ''He is more a student of Fidel the defiant than Fidel the Communist.'' Like Mr. Castro, Mr. Chavez seems to enjoy nothing more than tweaking the United States, which Washington, in a reflection of Venezuela's importance as an oil supplier, thus far has generally endured with patience.</p>
        <p>But there are real policy differences, too. Mr. Chavez has withdrawn the Venezuelan military from regional naval exercises in the Caribbean and refused to allow United States planes monitoring drug trafficking to fly in Venezuelan airspace. Washington's decision to use $1.3 billion to support Colombia's government in its war against guerrillas and drug dealers promises to make the relationship even more difficult.</p>
        <p>SOME of Mr. Chavez's former associates accuse him of supplying guns to leftist Colombian insurgents known as the FARC. He has denied that, but has also made it clear that he dislikes the American-sponsored Plan Colombia, warning that it may lead to ''the Vietnamization of the entire Amazon region'' and describing the helicopters Washington is sending to the Colombian government as ''death machines.''</p>
        <p>''In reality, Hugo Chavez and his government are on the side of the FARC,'' Richard Gott writes in ''The Shadow of the Liberator: The Impact of Hugo Chavez on Venezuela and Latin America'' (Verso), a new and flattering biography. ''Chavez wants the FARC to win, or at any rate to be so successful in the peace negotiations that its incorporation into the government will entirely change the political complexion of Colombia.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez's principal intellectual hero is Simon Bolivar, the hero of South American independence who dreamed of and fought for a united continent. Mr. Chavez has argued for the formation of a South Atlantic Treaty Organization, a Latin American counterpart to the International Monetary Fund and a single currency for all of South America, but he clearly wants more.</p>
        <p>''The idea of a reunified America, of a Bolivarian America, has arisen again,'' he said in a speech in July on the Liberator's birthday. And to Hugo Chavez, there is a natural leader of that movement -- himself.</p>
