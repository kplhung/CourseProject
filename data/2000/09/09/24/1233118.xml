        <p>PHILADELPHIA elementary school students are learning grammar with software that listens and talks back. North Carolina parents are holding confidential chats with teachers about high school seniors online. And Texas school administrators are planning curriculums with the click of a mouse.</p>
        <p>Each of these ideas was developed in a Westchester County laboratory, where scientists from the International Business Machines Corporation gathered after spending months on the road, brainstorming with teachers, students and administrators.</p>
        <p>Since 1994, more than 500 sites have asked for the company's help. I.B.M. specialists responded with technology ideas in 21 cases. Together, scientists and educators found solutions through a program called Reinventing Education, a cornerstone of the company's philanthropic effort, which has invested $40 million in programs in 16 states and in Brazil, Ireland, Italy and Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Leaders in business, government and education say the initiative stretches the idea of traditional corporate philanthropy, which usually involves legions of volunteers or money and gifts.</p>
        <p>Stanley Litow, the vice president of corporate community relations and president of the I.B.M. Foundation, the company's philanthropic arm, said Reinventing Education captures the firm's philanthropic goal not merely to pour out cash. Rather, he said, I.B.M. views philanthropy as a way to prove how technology can make a difference in people's lives.</p>
        <p>''Grant money, even in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, is not going to change what you do for children,'' Mr. Litow said. ''It can be helpful. It can provide supplemental services. On the other hand, what school systems really need is the tools that will make more valuable what they do with their own money.''</p>
        <p>Of the $125 million in total contributions by I.B.M. last year, 66 percent, or $82 million, was given in the form of technical assistance compared with 34 percent, or $43 million, given in cash.</p>
        <p>Of all the issues I.B.M. has earmarked for charity -- the environment, health and culture -- education receives the largest share. Three-quarters of the company's corporate philanthropy was directed to education beneficiaries last year, up from 70 percent in 1998, I.B.M. officials said.</p>
        <p>Rosabeth Moss Kanter, the Ernest L. Arbuckle professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, said I.B.M. is blazing a new trail in the world of corporate giving.</p>
        <p>''What is different about what I.B.M. does -- and I think it should be a model, they are definitely pioneers -- is not just that they are putting in volunteer labor of a casual kind,'' she said. ''They are putting talented scientists and professionals on large-scale, full-time problems to create an innovation. I.B.M. is trying to change things.''</p>
        <p>Providing volunteers to do manual labor like painting walls or landscaping has a purpose, but using what Ms. Kanter called the ''highest skills'' a firm has to offer is also valuable, because it creates long-term solutions to problems.</p>
        <p>Peter G. Fairweather, an I.B.M. scientist who was also a public school teacher in Chicago in the 1970's, put it this way:</p>
        <p>''If a school district is having trouble teaching people to read,'' he said, ''if we simply drove a truck full of computers there and dropped them off, we would never be able to get to the technology to remedy the reading problems.''</p>
        <p>Of course, helping educators is good for business, I.B.M. officials said. A well-educated community will invest in technology, and partnerships with academia could pave the way for some Reinventing Education ideas to be marketed to a wider audience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fairweather has made more than 100 trips to schools around the country, gathering information to take back to the T. J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights. In developing one program, called Watch Me Read, he and others recorded the voices of 1,800 children to capture a variety of intonations and accents to enable the computer program to communicate with children from a wide range of backgrounds.</p>
        <p>The Watch Me Read program was used in 1995 at the Will Rogers Elementary School in Houston, where school officials applied for an I.B.M. grant because they saw that students needed help understanding language, Ronald M. Dominy, the school principal, said. In four years, Mr. Dominy said he has watched first graders' test scores edge upward. Bilingual students' English-speaking ability has also improved, since the children are asked to repeat words they have mispronounced and can hear themselves saying things correctly.</p>
        <p>''The bilingual students, economically, don't have the resources the other families have and don't have access to computers at home,'' Mr. Dominy said. ''They took to it.''</p>
        <p>At Vance High School in Charlotte, N.C., Ann B. Clark, the principal, said that another I.B.M. program, called Wired for Learning, has been in place since 1997 and has gotten everyone more excited about education. The program helps pull teachers out of isolation and gets parents and students more involved, she said.</p>
        <p>''We have survey results from teachers and parents and students that definitely attribute the technology to better ongoing communication,'' Ms. Clark said. ''Parents feel more informed. And I think the teachers feel the instructional planning tool has enhanced their ability to plan and collaborate with other teachers and have a planning template.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Dominy and others said that computerized lessons cannot replace the traditional school setting of classrooms and teachers. Instead, skilled, caring teachers in combination with computer technology provide the best learning scenario, he said.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Litow said he stood in a first-grade classroom in Philadelphia as a Vietnamese girl who had been in the country for about a year read aloud the story of her life, which she had written earlier and loaded into a classroom computer.</p>
        <p>The girl's grandfather was there to watch her read the story as the rest of the children in the class read along with her. In simple, stark sentences, the girl talked about how her grandfather walked her to school, and Mr. Litow said the older man was clearly proud. The children were learning, on many fronts, he said.</p>
        <p>''The story was so poignant,'' Mr. Litow said. ''You think, 'What would have happened to this girl?' Somebody would have walked in and she would have been labeled as someone with a learning problem and that would get carried to grade three or four. And now, you have a new way of doing things.''</p>
