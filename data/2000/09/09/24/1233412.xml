        <p>Four straight losses at the end of last college football season cost Bob Sutton his coaching job at Army. Sutton's firing also marked the end of the run-oriented wishbone offense that Army had used for 16 years.</p>
        <p>Although the new head coach, Todd Berry, has instituted a wide-open passing offense, the result has not changed. Army lost, 26-16, to Memphis in a Conference USA game before a crowd of 38,375 at Michie Stadium. With the loss, the Black Knights matched their season-ending streak of four in 1999.</p>
        <p>With Memphis leading in the fourth quarter, 20-14, quarterback Curtis Zervic's pass into the end zone was picked off in the left corner by defensive back Idrees Bashir, who ran the ball back 105 yards for a touchdown with 3 minutes 49 seconds left in the game.</p>
        <p>Not only was it the longest pass interception run back in the 76-year history of Michie Stadium, but it also sealed Memphis's third victory in four games.</p>
        <p>That put a damper on an otherwise superb performance by Zervic, a third-string quarterback who a year ago was the manager of the Army men's lacrosse team after quitting the football team after his freshman year.</p>
        <p>Zervic entered today's game after quarterback Joe Gerena injured his right shoulder. The team's first-string quarterback, Chad Jenkins, has been sidelined since injuring an ankle against Boston College two weeks ago. Zervic completed 28 passes for 246 yards to tie a record set by Leamon Hall in 1976. He had four completions on Army's ill-fated drive. Army was on the Memphis 14-yard line when Bashir ended the Black Knights' hopes with his interception.</p>
        <p>''I thought I had Bryan Bowdish open when I threw the pass, but the safety made a great play,'' said Zervic, who also threw two other interceptions while connecting on 28 of 38 passes. ''Maybe I should have thrown the ball a bit shorter than I did.''</p>
        <p>That drive was just one of Army's many missed opportunities.</p>
        <p>Memphis led at halftime, 14-7, because the Black Knights did not score on two goal-line situations.</p>
        <p>Memphis tailback Sugar Sanders opened the scoring by sprinting 62 yards for a touchdown on the Tigers' first possession. Army, on its third possession, drove from its 19-yard line to the Tigers' 2. But the Black Knights came away empty when Brendan Mullen's 24-yard field-goal attempt sailed wide to the left.</p>
        <p>Army then squandered another scoring opportunity when, on the ensuing Memphis possession, Randy Mitchell blocked the punt by Ben Graves and Anthony Miller recovered the ball at the Tigers' 30.</p>
        <p>With Zervic connecting on four straight passes, the Black Knights advanced to the Memphis 1. Zervic was stopped for no gain on a quarterback sneak on fourth down.</p>
        <p>Army finally tied the score, 7-7,  when the 5-foot-7-inch Omari Thompson, who is used as a wide receiver, running back and kick-return specialist, took a punt at the Army 28-yard line and raced 72 yards down the left sideline just under six minutes into the third quarter.</p>
        <p>But Memphis soon regained the lead. Aided by a 15-yard roughing-the-passer penalty, Memphis followed with a 15-play, 78-yard drive that consumed almost seven minutes and ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by fullback Darche Epting with 3:03 left in the half.</p>
        <p>''We made too many mistakes today, and didn't play up to our capabilities,'' Berry said of Army, which duplicated a feat of the 1973 team.  That group lost its first four games and dropped all 10 games it played that season. The eight-game losing streak is the longest that Army has endured since the 1975 team lost its final nine games after winning its first two.</p>
