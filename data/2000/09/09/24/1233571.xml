        <p>Manager Tommy Lasorda insists he was not playing politics when he said he wanted his United States baseball team to win its preliminary game tonight against Cuba for Cuban exiles in Miami. He was not rattling sabers, he said; he was making a baseball pledge to friends.</p>
        <p>''I've played there,'' he said. ''I have friends who evacuated their homes. But it wasn't anything political, I was just thinking about winning the game. I wanted to win the game before for my cousin. I'll try to win one tomorrow for my brother Smokey.''</p>

        <p>Manager Tommy Lasorda insists he was not playing politics when he said he wanted his United States baseball team to win its preliminary game tonight against Cuba for Cuban exiles in Miami. He was not rattling sabers, he said; he was making a baseball pledge to friends.</p>
        <p>''I've played there,'' he said. ''I have friends who evacuated their homes. But it wasn't anything political, I was just thinking about winning the game. I wanted to win the game before for my cousin. I'll try to win one tomorrow for my brother Smokey.''</p>
        <p>Lasorda's team delivered for his cousin on Friday, beating Italy. But Cuba beat the United States, 6-1, behind 14 strikeouts by pitchers Jose Ibar and Pedro Luis Lazo. With their hitting in a funk, the Americans never recovered from the Cubans' four-run first inning off Rick Krivda, whose major league experience did not help him keep his pitches down in the strike zone.</p>
        <p>''I know one thing: we're not hitting the way we're supposed to'' Lasorda said.</p>
        <p>But as ordinary as the game was, things happened to cast it in a political light. Anything untoward between the teams of two geopolitical enemies whose national pastimes are baseball is destined for overinterpretation, if not as an ideological duel then as evidence of endemic animosity.</p>
        <p>In the fourth inning, Ibar plunked right fielder Ernie Young on the left shoulder. Cuba already led by 4-0, and Ibar was making American batters look like the minor leaguers they nearly all are.</p>
        <p>''The guy had pinpoint control and I get the benefit of a 94-mile-an-hour fastball on my shoulder blade,'' Young said. ''Yeah, I'm upset. I know he did it on purpose.'' As he stepped toward the plate, Young and Cuban catcher Ariel Pestano bumped into each other, clearing both benches.</p>
        <p>''The catcher crossed paths with me and I politely nudged him out of the way,'' Young said. He offered no reason that Ibar would hit him but added: ''I didn't think he'd want to fuel a fire with us. It didn't work this time, but maybe next time it will.''</p>
        <p>Ibar said he intended no ill will toward Young, who was leading the team with a .533 batting average going into the game. ''There were no intentions,'' Ibar said through an interpreter. ''It was badly interpreted, badly understood.''</p>
        <p>Jon Rauch, who struck out eight Cubans in four innings of relief for Krivda, said he contemplated retaliation, but the umpires warned him he would be ejected if he tried. ''The thought goes through your mind,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lasorda said, ''It's too bad that the team that gets warned can't do anything.''</p>
        <p>A second incident inflamed passions anew. In the eighth inning, pinch runner Yobal Duenas scored Cuba's sixth run by sliding hard into catcher Pat Borders, who caught a relay throw far up the third base line. Rodriguez's left foot flew between Borders's legs and spiked his left ankle. The ball flew out of Borders's glove. It was a meaningless run but a meaningful episode in this pseudo-political drama. Borders said later that he felt the slide was designed to injure.</p>
        <p>''It was a strong play, but not a dirty play,'' said Servio Borges, Cuba's manager. ''The runner has the right to go and get the base and he was being blocked. It was a strong play and the one who's protected is the catcher. He wears the gear to protect himself at the plate.''</p>
        <p>Borges said there was no political overlay to the game, nor anything special to playing the United States. ''On our part, there is no time for any antagonism,'' he said. ''We just go out and play.''</p>
        <p>The American team will play Australia to end the preliminary round, but with its 5-1 record it is already guaranteed a spot in the semifinals. Cuba, also with a 5-1 record, will face Japan.</p>
        <p>Lasorda said he refuses to think publicly about playing Cuba again. But after tonight's game, he may rethink his claim that he has seen no better team in this tournament than his own.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if we will play them again,'' he said. ''Do you know for sure if we will? 'Cause I don't. I don't answer hypotheticals. Should we face them again? That's a hypothetical.''</p>
        <p>Asked about Lasorda's trying to win the game for his Cuban exile friends, Borges declined to involve himself in a debate about those who have left the island since Fidel Castro became president. ''This victory is dedicated to the Cuban people, the 11 million who saw us train and supported us,'' Borges said. ''This is for the people of C-U-B-A.''</p>
