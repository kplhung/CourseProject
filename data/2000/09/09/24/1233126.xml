        <p>EVERYTHING that was new at the Westport Country Playhouse this past summer is new again.</p>
        <p>Or as Jeff Provost, the theater's press and marketing director put it last Tuesday, his second day on the job, ''It feels like a start-up theater with a 70-year history.''</p>
        <p>That history, reflected to the passerby in photographs and window cards all over the lobby, up and down the staircase and backstage is awesome indeed. Theater lovers, especially those with memories of glory days past, gape at the faces and the names on the walls: Shirley Booth, Maureen Stapleton, Geraldine Page, Burgess Meredith, Lillian Gish, Dorothy Gish.</p>
        <p>''And there are hundreds more in the catacombs,'' Mr. Provost said, referring to the theater's archives. ''It's a goldmine.''</p>
        <p>In talking about the future building on the past, he mentioned four new full-time positions, including his own, as a sign of the theater's new direction.</p>
        <p>''It's a giant step for a summer theater to make that year-round commitment,'' said Mr. Provost, a Southport resident, who remembers being an usher at the theater for seven summers in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>But along with new positions came the resignation last week of the chief executive officer and executive director, Elissa O. Getto, who moved to Westport from Cincinnati, where she had been president of three performing arts centers.</p>
        <p>Since Ms. Getto, once head of the Wilton High School music department, returned to Fairfield County possessed with considerable presenting (in contrast to producing) experience, she clearly expected that the playhouse would book a certain number of touring companies, in dance, for example, off season.</p>
        <p>For it seems clear that summer is still the operative word when one talks of the playhouse, plans for a year-round producing theater having been postponed.</p>
        <p>Though the playhouse is not adequately equipped for winter operation, outside groups, primarily dance companies and children's theater groups, use the space intermittently. These do not represent productions under the Westport Playhouse banner, merely bookings that are a source of rental income for the theater. That, simply put, explains the difference between producing and presenting.</p>
        <p>The playhouse's artistic manager, Janice Muirhead, said that Ms. Getto ''made sure the theater got underway.'' That was more a day-to-day matter, with an emphasis on technology. ''We had an archaic computer system and she galvanized efforts to propel us into the modern world,'' added Ms. Muirhead, who lives in New Haven.</p>
        <p>But it became increasingly clear, as the summer went on, that art was the product, Ms. Muirhead added. A playhouse statement said that Ms. Getto would be available as a consultant in its expanding education programs, and to whatever extent outside companies and attractions are presented.</p>
        <p>The statement went on to emphasize the playhouse's primary commitment ''to produce artistically driven theatrical programming'' and quoted Elizabeth Morten, the board president, as commending Ms. Getto for leading the theater's revitalization.</p>
        <p>Joanne Woodward is continuing as a chairwoman of the theater's artistic advisory council, along with Anne Keefe, who also serves on the board.</p>
        <p>The search for a new executive director has begun and Ms. Muirhead appears to be the primary hands-on year-round official at the moment.</p>
        <p>Ms. Muirhead described the season just ended as a good one. It consisted of one revival (directed by Ms. Woodward), one new play (''Orson's Shadow'') in collaboration with Williamstown Theater in Massachusetts, two brand new plays and one new musical. And there was ''Ancestral Voices,'' more a staged reading than a play by A. R. Gurney, which was the season's biggest draw, given two starry casts, including Ms. Woodward and Paul Newman.</p>
        <p>Reached at her Manhattan office, Ms. Woodward said, ''This has been an extraordinary learning process -- but it happened so quickly.''</p>
        <p>About the season, she said, ''I'm totally pleased,'' emphasizing that even though the Williamstown import was problematic, it was an experiment that succeeded, and that such an alliance, which ''contributes to the vitality of theater'' will go on.</p>
        <p>So, too, will Ms. Woodward's involvement with theater in general and Westport in particular. ''I was never much of a movie buff. It wasn't my favorite thing to do,'' she said. ''Theater is where I started and it's where you're really working.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Woodward, who is well known for directing Odets revivals, added, ''And we'll continue to do at least one play a year that reflects the history of the theater.''</p>
        <p>''We ran the gamut,'' was Ms. Muirhead's summary of the season. Subscription figures were up by 50 percent, she said, to 5,700 this year from 3,900 the previous year. Shows played to 81 percent capacity, on average, up from last year's 60 percent rate. ''We have proved we are a viable producing summer theater,'' she said. ''And we still have a sense of rebirth and renewal. But we have to concentrate on quality. We're not yet ready for the rest of the year; yes, we've got heat, but the wind whistles through the building. Now we are focused on next summer, from June through September.''</p>
        <p>And next summer's plans include expanded runs: 21 performances instead of 16 for each production. That will provide actors with 20 extra rehearsal hours. ''But we will produce five shows, not six,'' Ms. Muirhead added.</p>
        <p>As for year-round plans, Ms. Muirhead explained, renovations are a slower process. ''We have to build a staff to support the work of the theater, as opposed to confusing the issue.''</p>
        <p>By that, Ms. Muirhead meant that the theater did not wish to send mixed messages ''about what's ours and what's not.''</p>
        <p>''And I'm elated,'' she added. ''We have a gem of a theater, a little oasis of the imagination off Route 1.''</p>
