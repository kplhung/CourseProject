        <p>BOCA CHICA RESTAURANT +++  (212) 473-0108; 13 First Avenue, at First Street; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, Mexico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic are just some of the countries whose cuisines are juxtaposed on the enticing menu of this little pan-Latin restaurant. Appetizers include coconut shrimp; several quesadillas; tropical yam salad; avocado salad; green chili soup; and black bean soup. Entrees include shell steak; arroz con pollo; Cuban sandwich; camarones chipotle, which is shrimp in a tomato, chili and cilantro sauce; and pinones, which are sweet plantains stuffed with a savory mixture of ground beef and pork.

        <p>BULGIN' WAFFLES +  (212) 477-6555; 49 1/2 First Avenue, at East Third Street; $; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>In the East Village, this little Belgian fast food restaurant is making the case that the waffle is every bit as Continental as its more glamorous cousin, the crepe. Waffle batters include whole wheat, hazelnut, buckwheat, pecan, pumpkin, banana, carrot-raisin, peanut butter, nondairy  and rice flour. Toppings include pure maple; whipped cream; vanilla yogurt cream; mocha cream; fresh blueberries; lemon cream; and spinach-ricotta. ($25 and Under: 7/5/00)</p>
        <p>FLOR'S KITCHEN +  (212) 387-8949; 149 First Avenue, between Ninth and 10th Streets; $; no smoking; all major credit cards; www.florskitchen.com.</p>
        <p>Flor Villazan, the owner and chef of this little Venezuelan storefront,  traces many of her recipes back to her grandmother in Caracas, and the restaurant itself has an almost maternal glow to it. Appetizers include shredded beef, chicken or cheese arepas (filled corn cakes); deep-fried corn-flour empanadas; cauliflower and mango salad; and chupe, which is chicken in broth with chopped potatoes, peeled corn, chopped white cheese and milk. Entrees include shredded beef with rice, plantains and black beans; grilled fish with green plantains and rice; eye round of beef cooked in sauce; and hallacas, a plantain leaf wrap with meat filling. Desserts include caramel pudding; three-milk cake; and rice or bread pudding.  ($25 and Under: 2/3/99)</p>
        <p>LUCIEN +  (212) 260-6481; 14 First Avenue, between First and Second Streets; $$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards. ($25 and Under: 12/30/98)</p>
        <p>This crowded, smoky, somewhat disheveled little French place serves  old-fashioned homey meals, and for the most part the cooking is well executed. Appetizers include salmon tartare; mussels with white wine, shallots and cilantro; seared fresh goose liver on toast; escargots with garlic and parsley; and sweetbreads with garlic and parsley. Entrees include cassoulet toulousain with duck confit, garlic sausage and lamb shank; spring rack of lamb with flageolets and mushrooms; rabbit in Dijon mustard sauce; grilled salmon with Moroccan rassel hanut spice; duck, half confit and half magret, with candied turnips and figs; and  shell steak with French fries. ($25 and Under: 12/30/98)</p>
        <p>XUNTA +  (212) 614-0620; 174 First Avenue, near 11th Street; $; smoking permitted; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Xunta (pronounced SHOON-tuh) has the authentic feeling of a Spanish tapas bar. The owner and staff members are all Spanish. The music is also Spanish, from flamenco to Spanish pop. It's informal, crowded, smoky and loud, with dozens of tapas like grilled sardines, pickled octopus salad, pork with potatoes and onions, shrimp in garlic sauce and little clams in a marinade of wine and garlic. Xunta also offers a good selection of Spanish wines, including white albarinos. ($25 and Under: 2/ 21/97)</p>
