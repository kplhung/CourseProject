        <p>Under the mirror-ball effect from the sudden flurry of flashbulbs in the aquatic center, beneath the thundering sound of the foot-stomping Australians erupting at the buzzer, the American Maureen O'Toole finally pulled herself out of the pool.</p>
        <p>It was hard to let go, especially like this. Stunned by the controversial game-winning goal that gave the 4-3 victory and the gold medal in women's water polo to the Aussies tonight, crestfallen to see her amazing career in this sport end with a cruel twist, there was no way to disguise her sadness. A few yards away, her 8-year-old daughter, Kelly, was empathizing with tears in her eyes.</p>

        <p>Under the mirror-ball effect from the sudden flurry of flashbulbs in the aquatic center, beneath the thundering sound of the foot-stomping Australians erupting at the buzzer, the American Maureen O'Toole finally pulled herself out of the pool.</p>
        <p>It was hard to let go, especially like this. Stunned by the controversial game-winning goal that gave the 4-3 victory and the gold medal in women's water polo to the Aussies tonight, crestfallen to see her amazing career in this sport end with a cruel twist, there was no way to disguise her sadness. A few yards away, her 8-year-old daughter, Kelly, was empathizing with tears in her eyes.</p>
        <p>''I don't think she understands the full perspective of it, but she understands that we lost and I was sad,'' said the 39-year-old O'Toole, fidgeting with the silver medal the United States received after its loss. ''Losing the way we did, I think it just makes it hurt a little bit more. It's pretty painful.''</p>
        <p>One moment, their spirits were soaring after Brenda Villa scored a game-tying goal with 13 seconds left. The next moment, they were devastated. With only 1.3 seconds left, the bizarre end unfolded. Just after a foul was called on the American Julie Swail, Australia's Yvette Higgins quickly whirled a shot that was deflected outside the outstretched arms of goalkeeper Bernice Orwig. A roar from 18,000 strong erupted. The tension-filled match was over, time had run out.</p>
        <p>But for several minutes, the Americans remained bobbing in the water like corks, unsure of what just happened. Under the impression that the referees had called the foul inside of 7 meters, they believed the goal should have been discounted because Higgins did not pass the ball first, which is required under the rules.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the chairman of the technical commission, Gianni Lonzi, released a statement saying the foul happened outside of 7 meters. Therefore, Lonzi said Higgins was allowed ''an instant shot and a goal was scored.''</p>
        <p>But even if the foul occurred outside of 7 meters, at least two American players argued that Higgins moved forward and pump-faked, which would also disallow the goal because the movement has to be uninterrupted.</p>
        <p>''It's an anticlimatic way for it to end,'' Swail said. ''To have 1.3 seconds left, and to have it come down the way it did, that's difficult to take. But I think we can leave here with our heads held high. There were a lot of people who didn't think we'd be here.''</p>
        <p>The Americans squeezed into the Olympics, qualifying on one last chance in May by defeating the favored Italians in Italy. In a way, it seemed fitting for the Americans to play for the first gold medal in water polo against the Australians. For over a decade, members from both teams tirelessly campaigned for the sport's inclusion into the Olympics.</p>
        <p>Several Aussies planted themselves at the Sydney airport and held up signs of protest when Juan Antonio Samaranch visited several years ago. And O'Toole, who began playing the sport on boys' teams because there were no girls' programs, had been lobbying since the early 80's. In 1994, she retired with the belief that water polo was never going to gain acceptance.</p>
        <p>Once the unthinkable occurred, O'Toole was forced to make an emotionally wrenching decision. While she trained with the team in Los Angeles, she sent her daughter to live with her parents in Northern California. For the bulk of three years, O'Toole caught a Friday afternoon flight to see her daughter for the weekend.</p>
        <p>''It's painful to lose like this, but there's a lot more to life,'' O'Toole said. ''I have an 8-year-old. That's going to be my focus after this. I don't think any of us will forget how we lost. It will always be in my mind. But retiring doesn't make me sad at all. I'm definitely ready to retire. I knew this was going to be it. It's been a hard three years of training. It will be really fun to be a full-time mom.''</p>
        <p>She'll get to keep up with one 8-year-old instead of a United States team full of players half her age. For three years, O'Toole had to push her body to its boundaries, and, as a leader for the United States team, manufacture a positive attitude even when her energy was petering out.</p>
        <p>''Your body just doesn't recover as well,'' O'Toole said. ''It's hard to snap back.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, she stood as an example of endurance. For 23 years, she has absorbed blows in a physical sport where most of the pain is inflicted underwater, out of the referee's watch. Over that time, the player with the whip-snap throws and keen sense on defense has been recognized as the sport's greatest player. As much as anyone, the Australian team appreciated what she has given to the sport.</p>
        <p>Twice during the post-match interview session, members of the Australian team applauded O'Toole as she sat at the other end of the table. When asked why, Higgins piped up, ''She's a legend, a living legend.''</p>
        <p>One day, O'Toole's daughter will understand that. Tonight, all she knew was that her mother was sad. The history lesson will come later.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure what she understands at this point,'' O'Toole said. ''I think when I'm back with her on a daily basis, and she starts seeing me again, she'll understand it.''</p>
