        <p>THERE are two ways to give a dinner party and do very little work. Catering is easy, if not always interesting. A more entertaining approach is to invite guests to come over and do the cooking themselves.</p>
        <p>Back in the 1960's dinners organized in this fashion were called kitchen parties, one step closer to the stove than a covered-dish party. They've lingered in my repertory.</p>
        <p>In most kitchens, mine included, six is the maximum number of cooks that can be involved without causing countertop gridlock. It's up to the host and hostess to do the marketing and, then, just before the cooking team arrives, to arrange the ingredients according to recipe, with the necessary equipment at various stations in the kitchen. Be sure to have the serving pieces set aside, too.</p>
        <p>The following simply prepared menu for six that I've devised includes hors d'oeuvres meant to be eaten with Champagne or sparkling wine while the cooking proceeds. There is a complete shopping list and a schedule for the preparation, with each cook designated by letter. It would be a good idea to make two copies of each recipe and have them at each station.</p>
        <p>To be able to serve the first course by 7:30 or 8 p.m., it's advisable for the cooking guests to arrive at 6:30.</p>
        <p>Designating the various tasks can be done by drawing lots, by simply asking or by assigning. As hostess, I would probably be Cook B, simply because I know my oven. But at the same time, I'm also head counselor, making sure everything is going smoothly and even putting up with a guest who was so meticulous when slicing mushrooms that he threatened to delay the dinner by a half-hour. It got to the point where all the others stopped what they were doing to watch him.</p>
        <p>To anyone who is not interested in wielding a knife or lighting a burner I would give the job of setting the table and doing cleanup for the other cooks. Once I even bought plain white chef's aprons and used a waterproof marking pen to create a logo and write a guest's name on each. I presented them as party favors.</p>
        <p>Menu for Six:</p>
        <p>Smoked Salmon Toasts, Prosciutto With Persimmons</p>
        <p>Warm Arugula and Mushroom Salad</p>
        <p>Spice-Coated Salmon</p>
        <p>Mashed Potatoes</p>
        <p>Stir-Fried Sugar Snap Peas</p>
        <p>Apple-Plum Crisp With Vanilla ice Cream</p>
        <p>Wines:</p>
        <p>Champagne or sparkling wine (two bottles)</p>
        <p>Light-bodied American pinot noir like Saintsbury, Eyrie, King Estate (two bottles)</p>
        <p>Plan of Action:</p>
        <p>Cook A prepares fruit for dessert while Cook B prepares topping. Dessert goes into oven.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Cooks C and D prepare hors d'oeuvres, serve them when they're ready and pour Champagne.</p>
        <p>Cook E trims mushrooms for salad while cook F rinses and dries arugula. Both cooks take care of the rest of the salad, slicing the onion, rinsing chick peas and shaving cheese.</p>
        <p>Cook A peels potatoes and puts them, with garlic, in saucepan of cold water on stove.</p>
        <p>Cook B removes pin bones from salmon, makes spice mixture and spreads it on salmon.</p>
        <p>Cook A readies sugar snaps.</p>
        <p>Fifteen minutes before dinner is to be served, Cook E starts cooking mushrooms for salad. Cook F makes dressing and dresses arugula.</p>
        <p>Cooks E and F finish preparing salad.</p>
        <p>Cook A starts boiling potatoes.</p>
        <p>Cook B removes dessert from oven.</p>
        <p>Cook C is in charge of opening and pouring wine.</p>
        <p>Cook D sets up coffee maker, if needed, ready to be turned on later.</p>
        <p>Salad is served.</p>
        <p>After salad course has been cleared, Cook A warms milk and finishes preparing mashed potatoes and transfers them to a bowl for serving.</p>
        <p>Cook E stir-fries sugar snaps and transfers them to a bowl for serving.</p>
        <p>Cook B broils salmon and transfers it when done to platter.</p>
        <p>Salmon with mashed potatoes and sugar snaps is served.</p>
        <p>After main course is cleared, Cook A takes ice cream out of freezer, Cook B puts dessert plates on table and Cook C makes coffee. Dessert is served.</p>
