        <p>1. Not many men would turn down the chance to ford glacial rivers in hardy vehicles, explore vast lava fields, trek amid 100-foot waterfalls, angle for prize salmon and then sit nearly naked next to a beautiful blond ice princess in a steaming, mineral-rich geothermal pool. The collaborative artists Nicholas Kahn (right) and Richard Selesnick were no exception -- they had been eager to visit Iceland for some time. Although they had never done a fashion shoot before, the synergy was perfect: their work involves the construction of narratives in which they transform themselves and close friends into fictional characters to create pseudohistorical scenarios. The idea of two grown men playing dress-up and taking photographs for a fashion issue that deals with growing up seemed, well, ideal.  2. Inspired by the work of Odd Nerdrum, who paints many dark, brooding canvases of Iceland, Kahn and Selesnick are the latest in a crush of artists to heed the island's siren call. Other contemporary artists who have incorporated Iceland's unique light and stunning terrain into their work are Roni Horn, (a) Joan Jonas, (b) Gabriel Orozco and Olafur Eliasson.</p>

        <p>3. Reykjavik is the latest European city worthy of Wallpaper status. Jet-setters descended in droves a couple of years ago, and now it's difficult to find a creative type who hasn't been there. Named European City of Culture 2000, Reykjavik has all the requisite art galleries, museums, jazz bars and chic clothing stores. (a) Apparat, which bills itself as the CK Calvin Klein of Iceland, publishes its own cutting-edge magazine. And the city also has a pretty hot music scene. You've heard of Bjork, Moa and the Sugarcubes. Now get ready for the melodic electronica of young newcomers (b) Mum, whose latest CD can be found at Amazon.com for $14.49. But for all of Iceland's newfound glam, the food still leaves something to be desired. You can nibble on such avian delicacies as puffin and blackbird, but proceed with caution. Our photographers dared to order blackbirds, which were served five to a plate, rather than in the expected pie. The nearly raw, red meat was reportedly pretty hard to take but was made just bearable by a coating of cranberry cream sauce. Yum.  4. Food was only one occupational hazard. Our men's-fashion editor, Robert E. Bryan, was wrapped like a mummy, trussed and used to simulate the corpse of Sir Robert in our four-day ''expedition.''  5. One of Iceland's most famous natural wonders is the Blue Lagoon, a huge geothermal lake in Grindavik, about 45 minutes from Reykjavik. The lake is the product of outflow from the adjacent Svartsengl geothermal power plant. Iceland is dotted with natural hot tubs like this one, and they play an important part in the country's social life. Everyone soaks together. The steaming, mineral-laden waters are also reputed to be responsible for the disproportionate number of radiant-looking men and women walking around. To approximate an Icelandic glow, log on to www.bluelagoon.is, where you can choose from a whole line of lagoon-water-based skin-care products.  6. Designed to echo the craggy mountains and icecaps that dominate the country's topography, the Church of Hallgrimur (named after Iceland's favorite poet, Hallgrimur Petursson) is Reykjavik's most striking landmark; its steeple rises 73 meters above the town. The idea of such an architectural behemoth didn't sit well at first with many of the city's ordinarily reticent people. But the project, commissioned in 1937, forged ahead, and the church's nave was finally consecrated in 1986.  7. Icelandic sweaters are widely touted for their insulating qualities. For information on where to buy the genuine article, call the Handknitting Association of Iceland at 011-354-552-1890. Or you can buy the luxe version shown here by Polo Sport Ralph Lauren, $145, at selected Polo Ralph Lauren stores.  8. In 1998, Playboy sent Bruce Jay Friedman to Iceland in search of the ultimate blonde. He had a hard time choosing, considering just how many of them there are. In fact, Iceland has perhaps the most homogeneous population on the planet. The country is considered an ideal place in which to explore genetic links to serious illness, as most of its 275,000 inhabitants descend from a small group of ninth-century Celtic and Norse settlers. A Reykjavik company called Decode Genetics wants to build a genetic database of the country's citizens, but there's been a hue and cry over privacy issues and other ethical dilemmas. In other words, Icelanders may be keeping all that delicious blondness to themselves.</p>
