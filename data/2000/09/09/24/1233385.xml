        <p>The reports flowed steadily into the White House and State Department in recent days: Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharazi, was telling foreign officials, members of the Jewish and Iranian-American communities and human rights leaders that some of the 10 Iranian Jews convicted of cooperating with Israel would go free, and that the rest would have their sentences reduced sharply.</p>

        <p>The reports flowed steadily into the White House and State Department in recent days: Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharazi, was telling foreign officials, members of the Jewish and Iranian-American communities and human rights leaders that some of the 10 Iranian Jews convicted of cooperating with Israel would go free, and that the rest would have their sentences reduced sharply.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kharazi's spokesman, Hamid-Reza Asefi, said today that the foreign minister had said no such thing.</p>
        <p>The confusion underscores the difficulty of communicating with Iran through third parties in the absence of an official dialogue with the United States. It also reflects the personal negotiating style of Mr. Kharazi, a reserved, English-speaking former ambassador to the United Nations who speaks in a barely audible voice and is inclined to reply to questions with a nod or a monosyllable.</p>
        <p>In the end, an appeals court on Thursday reduced the sentences of the 10 Jews by two to six years. But all were kept behind bars, a ruling that has been sharply criticized outside Iran.</p>
        <p>''Did we have assurances? Not exactly,'' a White House official said. ''This was more a case of drawing inferences from Kharazi's body language.''</p>
        <p>Other administration officials said they had listened to the various second-hand reports about clemency and imminent freedom with hope, but not certainty.</p>
        <p>''We did have the impression that at least some of the prisoners would be released,'' a senior State Department official said. ''But we had no basis to think that this was a commitment or an authoritative prediction. I also suspect there was a lot of wishful thinking.''</p>
        <p>The conviction of the Jews has been loudly condemned as a miscarriage of justice that flouted international norms for a free and fair trial.  On Friday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright added her voice to the chorus, telling reporters at the State Department: ''We do not think that due process existed, either, in the whole way this was set up. So I think this is a disappointing decision.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview from Los Angeles, where he is accompanying Mr. Kharazi, Mr. Asefi denied that the minister had given any concrete pledges during his meetings at the United Nations this month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Asefi said that in all of his meetings with his counterparts, Mr. Kharazi ''underscored the separation of powers in the Islamic Republic,'' adding that the court was handling the case with full independence and uninfluenced by political considerations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Asefi also said, ''The defendants have experienced Islamic compassion to the extent possible under the circumstances.'' All that Mr. Kharazi did was to ''express his hope that within the framework of the laws in Iran, the sentences for those convicted would be mitigated on appeal.''</p>
        <p>But Scott Horton, president of the International League for Human Rights, said he had heard things differently. Pulling Mr. Kharazi away for a brief private conversation during a speech and dinner last Wednesday at the Century Club in New York, Mr. Horton said, he had been told the Jews would be granted a new trial.</p>
        <p>''I have no particular interest in embarrassing him,'' Mr. Horton said. ''His heart is in the right place on this issue. Obviously he doesn't want to appear as a fool or out of touch at home. I don't think he was attempting to mislead me on this. But I know I didn't mis-hear him.''</p>
