        <p>Listeners to the Washington Redskins' radio broadcasts this season on the flagship station WJFK-FM have heard a former Redskins great, defensive lineman Dave Butz, speaking on behalf of the National Rifle Association.</p>
        <p>''Who are the members of the N.R.A.?'' Butz asks in one of the advertising spots. ''We come from all walks of life -- we're police officers, engineers, members of the armed forces -- even ex-football players like me. In fact, we're as diverse as America itself. But we all share a belief in the right of responsible gun ownership. That's why I'm proud to be a member of the N.R.A.''</p>

        <p>Listeners to the Washington Redskins' radio broadcasts this season on the flagship station WJFK-FM have heard a former Redskins great, defensive lineman Dave Butz, speaking on behalf of the National Rifle Association.</p>
        <p>''Who are the members of the N.R.A.?'' Butz asks in one of the advertising spots. ''We come from all walks of life -- we're police officers, engineers, members of the armed forces -- even ex-football players like me. In fact, we're as diverse as America itself. But we all share a belief in the right of responsible gun ownership. That's why I'm proud to be a member of the N.R.A.''</p>
        <p>Some National Football League owners, general managers and other officials are angered that the N.R.A. is advertising on three teams' radio broadcasts.</p>
        <p>That bothers the league officials because the N.F.L. has had serious public-relations disasters with the high-profile arrests of some players, including Rae Carruth, the former Carolina Panther, who has been charged with first-degree murder for allegedly masterminding the shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend.</p>
        <p>Guns and professional football do not mix, some league officials believe.</p>
        <p>''It is almost comical,'' said one American Football Conference team owner, who would speak only if he was not identified. ''How can any team justify this in light of what has happened to some of our players recently?''</p>
        <p>According to its spokesman, the rifle association launched a radio advertising campaign with three high-profile teams -- the Redskins, the Detroit Lions and the Philadelphia Eagles -- to use the popularity of professional football to help expand its membership.</p>
        <p>''The N.R.A. is about a lot of things, such as gun safety, conservation and police firearm training,'' said Bill Powers, an N.R.A. spokesman. ''We want people to know that, and we think the N.F.L. can help us spread our message. The N.F.L. and the N.R.A. is a natural fit.''</p>
        <p>With the league attempting to deal with a rash of player violence off the field, league officials ask whether it is appropriate for teams to associate themselves with the rifle association.</p>
        <p>Though the league cannot prevent players from legally purchasing firearms, many teams privately tell players that firearms are more trouble than they are worth.</p>
        <p>Six team officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they said they feared upsetting the rifle association, agreed it was irresponsible to allow the N.R.A. to associate itself with professional football.</p>
        <p>Powers said the rifle association's radio campaign uses the voices of former players like Bill Bergey, who played linebacker for the Eagles from 1974 to 1980, and Lem Barney, a defensive back with the Lions from 1967 to 1977. According to Powers, the Redskins first approached the association about doing the advertisement, and the association agreed. Then, he said, the N.R.A. expanded the spots to Philadelphia and Detroit.</p>
        <p>The radio stations pay rights fees to the individual teams so they can broadcast the games. Then the station seeks advertisers to offset those and other fees.</p>
        <p>So while the teams and the rifle association do not deal with each other directly, the relationship between teams, advertisers and the stations is symbiotic; there is more than enough of a link to make some in the league extremely uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>Detroit games are broadcast on WXYT-AM with an audience of 600,000 to one million, according to Bill Keenist, the Lions' vice president of communications, broadcasting and news media. Keenist said the Lions did not allow the station to take advertisements from casinos or exotic dance clubs.</p>
        <p>He said the Lions did not see a problem with allowing advertisements from the rifle association and had not received any complaints from fans, other teams or the league.</p>
        <p>The Eagles had no comment, and the Redskins did not return phone calls.</p>
        <p>The league cannot prevent its teams from having the N.R.A. as a sponsor.</p>
        <p>Powers said his organization would most likely purchase radio advertisements in other N.F.L. cities and expand into other sports, such as baseball and Nascar, under an umbrella called N.R.A. Sports.</p>
        <p>''My hope is that teams realize this association is terrible for our sport, and back away,'' one National Football Conference team general manager said.</p>
        <p>Super Bowl for New York?</p>
        <p>If a proposed indoor-outdoor domed arena on the West Side of Manhattan is completed, it could guarantee New York City its first Super Bowl, according to several N.F.L. team owners.</p>
        <p>There have been discussions among league officials, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and representatives of Gov. George E. Pataki about having a Super Bowl in New York on a rotating basis, two owners said. That means the title game could be in Manhattan several times a decade, the owners believe.</p>
        <p>''There is little question that New York would get the Super Bowl if this arena was built,'' said Art Modell, the Baltimore Ravens' owner. ''I can't see any way there would not be enough votes to get it. It would pretty much be a definite.''</p>
        <p>Modell added, ''I also think if it did happen, there is a chance the Super Bowl would come to New York every few years or so.''</p>
        <p>Giuliani said last week that plans for a domed arena were moving forward. The arena could be used by the Jets, the Yankees, the Mets and Olympic events, as well as for concerts and conventions.</p>
        <p>Robert Wood Johnson IV, the Jets' owner, has been a proponent of his team's own stadium, since the Jets have always been temporary tenants in Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>It is believed that Johnson strongly supports the Manhattan stadium project and would move the Jets' games there.</p>
        <p>Modell said he recently spoke to Johnson at a Ravens game, and Johnson told him he would do everything possible to get the Jets their own stadium.</p>
        <p>''He seems pretty determined,'' Modell said.</p>
        <p>New York would be perfect for the Super Bowl, Modell and other owners said, for several reasons.</p>
        <p>First, the proposed stadium would seat up to 100,000 people, ideal for the Super Bowl, which often is short of seats because so many fans want to attend the game.</p>
        <p>Second, the league loves exposure for the Super Bowl, and the multitude of news media outlets in the area more than meets that need.</p>
        <p>Also, New York is accustomed to conducting large events, which owners believe is a necessity for a potential host city.</p>
        <p>Pataki and Commissioner Paul Tagliabue exchanged pleasantries inside the box of the Redskins owner Daniel Snyder last Monday night before Washington's loss to the Dallas Cowboys. The governor and the commissioner are crucial parties in the stadium efforts.</p>
        <p>Bailey at Wide Receiver</p>
        <p>Look for the Redskins to use defensive back Champ Bailey more as a wide receiver in tonight's game against the Giants.</p>
        <p>The Redskins are desperate for a deep threat because of the absence of wide receiver Michael Westbrook, who is lost for the year with a torn knee ligament.</p>
        <p>Bailey could be their man. In his last season at Georgia, Bailey played defensive back and wide receiver. He caught 47 passes for 744 yards.</p>
        <p>Last Monday night against Dallas, Bailey was used on four offensive plays, drawing a double team on one pass pattern and a pass-interference penalty on another.</p>
