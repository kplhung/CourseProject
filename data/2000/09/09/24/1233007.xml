        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a vice president of the Vivekananda Retreat in Stone Ridge, N.Y., I would like to point out several inaccuracies regarding the Vedanta Society and the Ramakrishna Order in your review of ''A Place in the Country'' (Aug. 13), by Laura Shaine Cunningham. (1) A shrine trail is in no way equivalent to the Stations of the Cross. (2) The shrine trail has yet to be completed. And (3) it was never intended as a tourist attraction for ''busloads of devotees.''</p>
        <p>As a general rule the Vedanta Society does not proselytize; nor does it advertise or promote its religion and philosophy. However, Cunningham requested permission to use the shrine trail whenever she wished, which the retreat gladly granted. It may be of interest that many noted writers and thinkers, like Christopher Isherwood, Aldous Huxley, Joseph Campbell and Arnold Toynbee, were drawn to and supported the Vedanta philosophy that Vivekananda propounded.</p>
