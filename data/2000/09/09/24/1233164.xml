        <p>THE shortage of school bus drivers resulting from the expanding economy and the state's low unemployment rate has made the first few weeks of the school year chaotic ones. Buses in many towns are regularly late, routes have been expanded so students have to leave for school earlier and get home later, and in some cases, most notably in Stamford where the shortage has been acute, buses haven't come at all.</p>
        <p>The problem has gotten so bad, and the search for new drivers so futile, that some bus companies have offered up to $2,000 signing bonuses for drivers, increased wages by more than 30 percent, and have put their office staff on the road. In at least two cases, company presidents have had to get behind the wheel to keep the buses running.</p>
        <p>Many parents are getting fed up, demanding meetings with school and bus officials and often abandoning the bus altogether, driving their children to school instead. Of course, that has led another frustration: traffic jams at pick up and drop off as more cars head to school.</p>
        <p>''We're getting calls about bus driver shortages from all around the state,'' said Thomas Murphy, spokesman for the State Department of Education. ''This should come as no surprise. We have a very strong economy. People who might in the past have been interested in becoming bus drivers have other options.</p>
        <p>Like working for the casinos in Ledyard and Uncasville, an area of the state feeling the shortage. Or jobs at the corporations and new high-tech companies that fill Fairfield County. With well-paying jobs seemingly so available, and with a statewide unemployment rate of about 2.5 percent, bus companies are having difficulty finding drivers to work for pay ranging from $9 to $18 an hour or more, depending on the area. That's up from an average of $8 to $10 five years ago. In Thomson, a particularly hard-hit area, bus drivers earn $21 an hour, said Robin Leeds, executive director of the Connecticut School Transportation Association.</p>
        <p>Still, while wages are rising, driving is still a part-time job, and a stressful one at that, considering the responsibility of caring for dozens of children. Drivers work an average of five hours a day, so even in Thomson, drivers are making only $525 a week. That's about $20,000 a school year in a state where the median annual income is $62,800.</p>
        <p>The shortage of bus drivers in Connecticut mirrors a nationwide problem. Richard Fischer, a school bus consultant in Peyton, Colo., estimates the national shortage at 20 percent. Schools across the nation have begun staggering their start times as one method to permit fewer drivers to make more runs.</p>
        <p>Stamford was the hardest hit at the start of this school year. The district was already short drivers, when 24 failed to show up for the first day of school, bringing the shortfall to 40 drivers.</p>
        <p>Responding to a crisis in Stamford that left many students stranded during the first weeks of school, the Laidlaw Bus Company, with 800 routes and 900 to 950 drivers statewide, is offering sign-up bonuses of $2,000 for already certified drivers, and $1,000 for people who are willing to complete the approximately four-week training program, required for certification, said Ronald Timula, general manager of Laidlaw. State law requires school bus drivers to get a commercial drivers license, along with a criminal-background check and drug and alcohol testing, he said.</p>
        <p>The company has also dramatically increased wages. New drivers in Stamford, who previously were paid $22 for a 2 1/2-hour run and a $7 a day as an incentive bonus just for showing up, now earn $30. So new drivers make $67 a day if they drive two shifts, totaling about five hours. The wages of experienced drivers (those who have been with the company for three years or more) rose from $31.75 to $38 a shift, allowing them to make, with the $7 bonus, $83 for the entire day. The company is also offering fully paid health insurance immediately, rather than the previous one-year waiting period.</p>
        <p>Mr. Timula also said that Laidlaw reached an agreement with the Teamsters Union in Stamford this month and has brought in 40 drivers from out of state, 30 of whom are still in training.</p>
        <p>''We still have some glitches, but expect to have them solved very soon,'' he said, ''once we get more new drivers on the road. We intend to fulfill our obligations to the Stamford School District and make it unnecessary for the district to desire to break the contract.''</p>
        <p>Rosa Rastegar of Stamford was livid when the bus failed to pick up her three children, and she had to drive them. She and her husband, Saiid, are also irked by the very early pick-up time for her high school daughter, which was pushed from 7:05 a.m. last year back to 6:35 a.m. this year. Her daughter will soon be waiting for the bus in the dark, she said.</p>
        <p>''They had all summer to work things out,'' Ms. Rastegar said. ''We feel it's time to change bus companies. Laidlaw has constant problems and ups and downs.''</p>
        <p>Lisa Arons, whose sons, Noah, 5, and Jonathan, 7, attend Roxbury Elementary School in Stamford, found the bus so erratic that she now drives</p>
        <p>''We're driving our children to school, but there are major problems when pickup time comes,'' she said. ''There isn't enough space allocation for all the cars. Pick up is a nightmare. There's nowhere to put all the cars that are getting there early.''</p>
        <p>Under pressure from the Board of Education and parents, Laidlaw had agreed to relinquish its contract at the end of the year.</p>
        <p>At least two hard-pressed bus company presidents have been getting behind the wheel since the start of the school year, covering routes when enough drivers can not be found. Clerical workers and mechanics who have the necessary certification are also driving.</p>
        <p>John Sylvanie, president of the Greenwich and New Canaan Bus Companies is one of them. He is driving, despite a wage scale his company offers of $12 to $14 an hour, 401(k) plan, and vacation time. Mr. Sylvanie has managed to cover his bases without disruption to his customers by ''getting as creative as we could and rerouting all the schools, making some routes shorter and others longer. We work very closely with our customers, but we're still short of drivers.''</p>
        <p>Because Greenwich and New Canaan do not have a large pool of people willing to work as school bus drivers, he has done aggressive recruiting in urban areas and imports drivers from New York, and where the parent company, the Suburban Bus Company, is situated.</p>
        <p>Even with all those measures, he has no spare drivers and admitted the system could confront severe disruptions with an outbreak of the flu this winter. ''More resources have to go into the system,'' Mr. Sylvanie said. ''My costs have gone up two or three times. Fuel is way up, auto liability insurance and health insurance are up.''</p>
        <p>He does not believe firing bus companies will solve the problem, since the shortage of drivers is so widespread. ''The school systems have to put sufficient resources into transportation,'' he said. ''Money doesn't grow on trees. They can't keep going with the lowest bidder to save money, and think things will work. The whole system needs to be rethought.''</p>
        <p>Rising school enrollment across the state is compounding the problem. The state's student population this September followed a 12-year growth cycle, adding 4,000 new children, or a total of 558,860.</p>
        <p>School districts may have to appeal to the community for more money if the trend continues, he said.</p>
        <p>''There's no short-term fix,'' Ms. Leeds said. ''From what I've heard, people are looking to the labor shortage continuing until 2025.''</p>
        <p>Some Wilton middle school parents are so fed up with their children's long bus routes, they are car-pooling them to school instead. One Ridgefield teacher said most of her students are tardy, due to late bus arrivals, disrupting the school day.</p>
        <p>West Hartford has also felt the crunch of late arrivals, according to the school transportation director, Olivia Harry. The school district is served by the Double AA Transportation Company, which was awarded the contract this year for the first time. First Student Inc. previously served the district.</p>
        <p>Double AA was unexpectedly short 24 drivers at the start of the school year, but has hired more drivers and used company staff to cover all its runs. The company president, Tony Autorino, has been driving a regular route, in addition to running the bus company. ''We didn't feel the shortage until the fall,'' he said. ''We have mostly young mothers driving, because they can bring their preschool children on the bus. Not everyone wants to be a bus driver because it's an ultra high responsibility.'' His company pays drivers $11.50 per hour.</p>
        <p>Gene Garriepy, 66, of Newtown has been driving for Laidlaw's Brookfield terminal for 11 years. He generally likes the job, he said, because he cares about the children and feels he is able to make a contribution to their well-being through the relationships he forms with some families. Mr. Garriepy started in 1989 at $9 an hour, was earning about $9.75 an hour five years ago and now brings home $12.60 an hour for an average of 25 to 28 hours a week.</p>
        <p>''If my wife wasn't working, and we didn't have income from investments, I wouldn't be able to do it,'' he said. Drivers receive few benefits, aside from three paid personal days and a 401(k) they must fund themselves, without company contributions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Leeds cited several solutions for the driver shortage, including staggered start times to allow fewer drivers to cover more routes and raising their hours to full-time. She also recommended using school buses for other purposes in the community, since Connecticut has little mass transportation.</p>
        <p>This would give drivers more hours and put the buses to greater use, benefiting the bus companies and the communities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy and Mr. Garripey agree with Ms. Leeds that staggered hours would help solve the problem. All-year school and better working conditions for the drivers would also help, Mr. Garriepy said.</p>
        <p>Not all areas of the state are hurting, however.</p>
        <p>School officials in Waterbury, Danbury, Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven, where the labor pool is larger and the cost of living is lower than in other parts of the state, said they had enough drivers.</p>
        <p>Gary Levine, contract manager for First Student Inc., with routes in Bethel, Easton and Redding, said the situation looked precarious this summer, but he was able to bring in drivers in July and has enough to cover the routes.</p>
        <p>''We have 46 routes and 46 drivers, but we don't have spares,'' he said. ''We're very fortunate to have drivers back from last year, but we need spares.''</p>
