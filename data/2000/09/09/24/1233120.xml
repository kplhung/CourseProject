        <p>Prospective home buyers -- or anyone concerned about a neighborhood -- can now gain access through the Internet to government maps and documents pinpointing environmental problems and offering information about communities across the country.</p>
        <p>The free service, which began last Tuesday and was immediately overwhelmed by demand, is a joint project of two federal agencies, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>The first thing visitors to the Web site for the maps found last week was a box headlined ''Our Apologies,'' saying that the site had been experiencing delays and redirecting visitors to a similar map site maintained by the environmental agency. ''Within the first four hours we got 10,000 requests for maps,'' said Lee Jones, a spokesman for the housing department. ''It's up and running, but we plan to put a superserver in place within two weeks so that nobody has to wait.''</p>
        <p>Dick Burk, the associate secretary of Housing and Urban Development who led the team that created what the department calls HUD E-Maps, said environmental data can be found ''for every ZIP Code, every neighborhood.'' The Web site, www.hud.gov/emaps, has maps showing toxic release sites, brownfield sites, waste-handling sites, industrial plants, waste-water treatment plants and federal Superfund cleanup sites.</p>
