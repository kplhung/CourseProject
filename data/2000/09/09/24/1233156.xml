        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In Salman Rushdie's latest novel, two goats find their way into a movie house in Bombay. As the goats chew on celluloid, one asks the other what he thinks of the film. ''It's all right,'' the first goat replies, ''but the book was better.''</p>
        <p>This complaint, as old as the cinema, seems to be the thesis statement of Lisa Zeidner's article. With a tone half-bemused, half-pitying, she there-theres Merchant-Ivory's naivete in trying to put ''The Golden Bowl,'' James's most difficult novel, on the big screen. No, the textual and subtextual nuances of Jamesian prose will never be transcribed precisely to the cinema; but if film were meant to mimic its source material in form and content, there would be little use for adaptation.</p>
        <p>I am a scholar of James and happen to have seen ''The Golden Bowl''; while the cinema will never emulate the power of a Jamesian semicolon, James's novel will never deliver to us the grand and complex visual splendor of the new Merchant-Ivory film; nor can James perform for us the dialogue that he has so masterfully written. Should filmmakers neglect one of our great novelists because, from an academic standpoint, film cannot present to us the subtleties buried in prose?</p>
        <p>Professor Zeidner also claims that modern audiences are not sophisticated enough to understand a complex treatment of this novel. ''Let's face it,'' she writes, ''a modern audience can barely tell a tasteful gown from a tacky one.'' The author would do well to note that not all filmgoers are the bovine spectators she imagines them to be -- though her complaints seem as petulant as the goat's.</p>
