        <p>SWISS voters will roll out the apparatus of direct democracy today and consider, alongside proposals on fuel taxes and voting procedures, whether to limit the resident foreign population to 18 percent. Sponsors of the bill point out that the current level is over 19 percent a 25 percent increase over the last 10 years. But opponents of the initiative, who appear to be in the majority, argue that it would undermine the Swiss economy and tarnish the countrys image abroad. Six similar initiatives have found their way to the bal-lot box since 1970. Each one has failed. But the 18 percent initiative, as it has come to be known, is particularly contentious because it would provide exceptions for highly educated foreigners involved in technological and scientific pursuits, leaving asylum seekers and poorer immigrants at the mercy of the new quota. Switzerland has one of the highest proportions of foreign residents in Europe. Here is a look at how the country compares with its neighbors, and where most of the new arrivals are coming from.</p>
