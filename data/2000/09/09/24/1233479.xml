        <p>Gore campaign officials said tonight that they had temporarily removed a junior staff aide because he had given incorrect information to ABC News, but they said the aide had nothing to do with the transmission of confidential information from the Bush campaign to Gore associates.</p>
        <p>Mark Fabiani, deputy campaign manager for Vice President Al Gore, said the campaign had put Michael Doyne, 28, on paid leave until Wednesday. But, Mr. Fabiani said, ''It is our firm belief that he has no knowledge of any information passed to or from the campaign.''</p>
        <p>ABC News was investigating the mailing of information about Gov. George W. Bush's debate preparations to a Gore adviser.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, ABC News told the Gore campaign that it had learned of the possibility of a Gore ''mole'' within the Bush campaign, Gore officials said.</p>
        <p>In a statement tonight, the Gore campaign said that Mr. Doyne had first said he was ''not aware of any 'mole.' '' But, the statement said, several hours later, Mr. Doyne told ABC News and the campaign that he may have told a friend about a mole but that it was ''not based on any actual facts or any actual knowledge.''</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, called the news troubling, adding that it suggested that people in the Gore campaign may have ''more knowledge about the possible transfer of information than was previously thought.''</p>
