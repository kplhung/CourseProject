        <p>1. The Experience Music Project, or E.M.P., which opened last June, is a $240 million, 140,000-square-foot museum designed by Frank Gehry and conceived by Jody Allen Patton and her brother, Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen, who financed the project. Originally intended as a gallery dedicated to Jimi Hendrix, E.M.P. grew to include 80,000 artifacts, from rock memorabilia to a 30-foot sculpture made of over 500 guitars. It also contains interpretive and interactive exhibits that trace the history of rock and allow visitors to play instruments and mix their own music. As you might expect from a museum located in the heart of Microsoft country, its state-of-the-art computer wizardry required enough cable to wrap around the earth, according to the museum's Web site, www.emplive.com.  2. E.M.P. is located in the Seattle Center, the 74-acre site of the1962 World's Fair. The fair's official name was the Century 21 Exposition, but the Center never quite got there until now. Its most famous remnant, the 605-foot-high Space Needle, complete with revolving restaurant, was intended to symbolize the fair's futuristic theme, but became as quaint as a ''Jetsons'' cartoon. A recent $20 million makeover, and its proximity to E.M.P., should help make it truly modern. But its biggest shot in the arm was its hilarious cameo appearance in last year's ''Austin Powers'' sequel, as the headquarters of that evil empire, Starbucks.

        <p>3. The Seattle Center Monorail was built as a link between the 1962 fair and the city's downtown, a distance of 0.9 miles the train covers in two minutes, making it a handy way to avoid traffic during sporting events and other crowd generators. Now, the monorail has someplace else to go; it runs right through the E.M.P.  4. In 1981, Gehry was considered so ''fringe'' that he felt compelled to deliver a talk called ''I'm Not Weird.'' So it's a bit ironic that the now-71-year-old Gehry finds himself the It Boy of contemporary architecture -- a role secured for him by his design for the Bilbao Guggenheim, and cemented by the E.M.P. Gehry, urged by Paul Allen to design something ''swoopy,'' broke rock guitars into pieces to generate his earliest design models; the colors of the exterior forms -- red, blue, purple, silver and gold -- come from guitar finishes. And while the building looks as if it bubbled forth from some superannuated stoner's lava lamp, its undulating forms could have been engineered only with the help of a sophisticated three-dimensional computer-modeling program -- CATIA, originally developed to design Mirage fighter jets.  5. Paul G. Allen -- depending on what's happening in the stock market -- is the third-richest man in the world. But with a net worth of around $30 billion, who's counting? The man who founded Microsoft with his boyhood pal and fellow college dropout Bill Gates is one of the world's largest new-media investors; his Vulcan Ventures has also bought chunks of Priceline.com and TheStreet.com. Now one of the Northwest's major philanthropists, Allen owns the Portland Trail Blazers and the Seattle Seahawks, and his youthful passion for rock guitar and Hendrix (Allen still plays with a band) ultimately led to the E.M.P.  6. One of the models on this photo shoot was Matthew Avedon, the 17-year-old grandson of the photographer Richard Avedon. A native New Yorker, Matthew was discovered by the photographer Arnaldo Anaya-Lucca and is now represented by the Next agency. A film buff and skateboarder, Matthew lives in New York with his mother, and currently has no plans for college, preferring instead a full-time modeling career.  7. Hendrix, the rock deity who died in 1970, has his own gallery at E.M.P. It includes his notebook with the lyrics for the album ''Electric Ladyland,'' as well as an interactive multimedia kiosk devoted to Hendrix's songwriting, the guitar on which he played ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' at Woodstock and a shard of the guitar he smashed onstage at the Saville Theatre in London in 1967.  8. You may not be able to afford one of these artifacts, but you can get one like it: Fender's Jimi Hendrix Tribute Stratocaster, in Olympic White, for $1,650, with case, from www.fender.com.</p>
