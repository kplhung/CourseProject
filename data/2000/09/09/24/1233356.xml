        <p>Marketers are always looking for a gimmick to cut through the clutter. A popular line of attack is to send a select list of prospective customers something attractive and memorable in the mail.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers can say it with a product sample, but that rarely works for service companies, which tend to turn instead to something metaphorical to get the message across.</p>
        <p>A Los Angeles law firm, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver &amp; Hedges, which says it is the largest in the country to concentrate exclusively on business litigation, wanted to convey the idea that business is war, and its 100-odd lawyer-commandos were ready to storm the battlements for their clients. So it mailed out hand grenades.</p>
        <p>Office workers at one of the recipients, Deliverex of San Jose, Calif., called the bomb squad on Monday. Another of the mailings, apparently thrown away unopened, caught the attention of sorters at a recycling plant in Sunnyvale, Calif., on Tuesday; they also called for help.</p>
        <p>The grenades were dummies, of course, but in the mail, dummies can be just as illegal as real ones. Still, the Postal Service told The Associated Press that it would not take action against the law firm because it saw no malicious intent.</p>
        <p>Instead of fielding inquiries from interested would-be clients, Quinn Emanuel spent last Wednesday contacting everyone on its mailing list and warning them about the packages' contents.</p>
        <p>''The lesson here,'' said Steven G. Madison, a partner in the firm, ''is, 'Don't believe everything the marketing consultants tell you.' ''</p>
