        <p>Two years ago, detectives were given the grisly task of identifying the remains of a young girl found in a barren Queens field, her body scorched beyond recognition. The girl remained unidentified until late last week, when a routine arrest unexpectedly yielded both the victim's name and a suspect in her murder.</p>
        <p>The police said their break came when they arrested Thomas Bryant, 20, in connection with a burglary. Seeking leniency, he unintentionally implicated himself and later confessed to killing the 12-year-old girl, the police said. He is now charged with second-degree murder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bryant was arrested Wednesday night after officers patrolling in Springfield Gardens, Queens, said they saw him trying to break into a house. He was taken to the 113th Precinct station house. There, he admitted to several burglaries. He also said he knew who killed the girl, whose body was found in July 1998 in a field off 136th Avenue in Springfield Gardens, said Sgt. Brian Burke, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>''He thought it would be favorable for him on the burglary charge if he had information on the homicide,'' Sergeant Burke added. ''But that plan backfired.''</p>
        <p>Detectives were suspicious because Mr. Bryant knew most of the details of the crime. After talking to several other people, including the man that Mr. Bryant had implicated, the detectives questioned Mr. Bryant again on Friday.</p>
        <p>After hours of questioning, Mr. Bryant confessed to the killing, said Officer Chris Cottingham, a police spokesman. Mr. Bryant identified the victim as LeeAnn Mitchell. She had disappeared the day before her body was discovered.</p>
        <p>Investigators had been unable to identify the skeletal remains because of the poor condition of her body. They said they believed she was abducted in the neighborhood and sexually assaulted. They said her head may have been smashed into a concrete wall in a fatal blow before she was burned.</p>
        <p>Officer Cottingham said that detectives believed Mr. Bryant knew the girl from the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the home where Ms. Mitchell's parents had lived, on Westgate Street in Springfield Gardens, was boarded up.</p>
        <p>Those answering the door at the Queens address given to detectives by Mr. Bryant said he went by the nickname Freddie and lived on the streets. Mary Toth, 25, who lives at that address, said her mother had adopted Mr. Bryant when he was 5 years old in 1985. Three of Mr. Bryant's siblings were adopted by other families, she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Toth described Mr. Bryant as a quiet young man who wrote poetry. ''He jokes around a lot, but always in the family style,'' she said. ''He can make words rhyme. He did a lot of writing when he was little.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Toth said that ''the first time he got in trouble was when he was 12 or 13,'' adding that the problems quickly escalated until he moved out  and began living on the streets of southeastern Queens.</p>
        <p>''Freddie was gone before we moved here 10 years ago,'' Ms. Toth added. She said that although Mr. Byrant gave the police the family address, they had not seen him lately. ''We always see him on Farmers Boulevard,'' she said.</p>
