        <p>In Praise of Public Life</p>
        <p>By Joseph I. Lieberman</p>
        <p>with Michael D'Orso.</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster, $21.</p>
        <p>According to Joseph I. Lieberman, the United States faces a critical shortage of politicians. ''In Praise of Public Life,'' written with Michael D'Orso, who collaborated with the civil rights leader John Lewis on his autobiography, is his recruitment pitch. Politics, he assures us, is not a career reserved for scoundrels; one can campaign for public office and work in Washington without selling one's soul. Lieberman is so earnest it is hard not to root for his argument, but it is not persuasive; anyway, in the light of his selection as the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, the book is sure to be mined for insights into the man. He argues that his fellow Democrats created many of the country's most pressing problems when they ''cast out religion and faith as having virtually no presence or value whatsoever in politics and public life.'' He calls for a religious awakening, a new grounding in faith; he even seeks limits on tolerance: ''We appear to have become so wary of being labeled intolerant that we were increasingly unwilling to assert long-held communal values and make moral judgments. We confused tolerance and respect for all people with tolerance and acceptance of all behavior.'' The book is full of the martial language of a committed soldier in the culture wars: ''And there is a swelling sense that much of our culture has become toxic, that our standards of decency and civility are being significantly eroded by the entertainment industry's shameless and pervasive promotion of violence, sex and vulgarity, and that the traditional sources of values in our society -- such as faith, family and school -- are in a life and death struggle with the darker forces of immorality, inhumanity and greed.'' He concludes that ''the Religious Right seems to me in hindsight to have been more right than not in its expressed concern about the decline of community morality and decay of our public culture.'' When was the last time a Democrat had good words for the Religious Right? You have to wonder: would Lieberman write the same thing today?</p>
