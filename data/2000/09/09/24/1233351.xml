        <p>What do a rock star, a Treasury secretary and the pope have in common? Well, not their wardrobes. But even in his black garb and dark glasses, Bono, the singer of the Irish band U2, fit in philosophically with Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers and a bevy of legislators as they pushed for foreign debt relief last week.</p>
        <p>Standing outside the Capitol, Bono, who has spent years campaigning to let poor countries escape their debts, was joined by supporters like Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. Bono joked that he would have to scare up concert tickets for all his new friends in Congress. ''It's going to be a lot of tickets,'' he said. ''Just the sight of Orrin Hatch in the mosh pit -- it's exciting.''</p>
        <p>Pope John Paul II was not there, but he has appeared with Bono before. As part of Jubilee year observances, both are working in an international movement to forgive third-world debt.</p>
