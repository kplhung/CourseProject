        <p>The entire 52-acre garden was their territory, but they hung back by the sun-drenched lily pond terrace on a recent Sunday afternoon, murmuring to each other about the glory of the red-purple petunias and fragile white impatiens.</p>
        <p>Well actually, he, 23, short and slender, dressed in an oversized black suit and hat on an 80-degree afternoon, was waxing lyrical about the late summer flora. ''Not every one is the same!'' he marveled, on this, his first sojourn to the garden. ''Each one, it's amazing, nothing that mankind can do.''</p>
        <p>She, 19, seemed lukewarm, as though struggling to understand his enthusiasm. And that was sort of the point of this exercise -- a date, if you can call it that, intended not to woo and wow a beloved but to discern whether she or he is the one to marry. (For the anxious, aging yuppies, the equivalent may be, say, the Red Cat in Chelsea or an evening at the Village Vanguard.)</p>
        <p>Not so for the strictly Orthodox set. For them, and for the most cosmopolitan among the Hasidim (what Samuel Heilman, the Harold Proshansky professor of Jewish studies and sociology at the City University of New York, calls the ''liberal left of the radical right'') the Brooklyn Botanic Garden is among the handful of preferred courting venues. For starters, it is on the edge of the Hasidic enclave of Crown Heights and a swift train ride from Borough Park and Midwood, other major Orthodox neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>The garden allows for quiet conversation, interrupted by an occasional quacking of ducks. It allows for privacy and yet it does not violate the Orthodox restriction against an unmarried man and woman being alone in a closed space. Unlike Central Park or even Prospect Park next door, there are no immodestly clad joggers or sunbathers. Unlike a museum, it does not have a surfeit of the secular. And face it, for all but the petunia-phobic, the garden is, well, pretty.</p>
        <p>''They're not really wooing each other but trying it out, to see if there's some compatibility,'' Professor Heilman said. ''They necessarily have to look for places that are public but that allow for a sense of privacy. The fact that it's open is key, and there are nooks and crannies they can go to.''</p>
        <p>That description would apply metaphorically as well. The garden, after all, is a public space, teeming with people from the outside (God forbid, maybe even a nonbeliever or two). But it is possible to create one's own communal nooks and crannies here, just as it is in the city itself. Therein lies the ordinary paradox of city life: Even the most orthodox, of whatever faith, can survive, even flourish, amid such cosmopolitan excess.</p>
        <p>''What they do is create their own place,'' is how Professor Heilman put it.</p>
        <p>To accommodate such observant visitors, the garden does not charge admission on Saturday mornings. The Orthodox are prohibited from carrying cash and many other objects. For some of the most Orthodox, the prohibitions even extend to a driver's license or a membership card. Garden officials therefore have a special policy for members all day on Saturday: A membership list is kept at the ticket windows, and members simply have to offer their names but not proof of identity.</p>
        <p>Sundays are the most popular times for courting in the garden. Certainly, the strictest of the Hasidim still do not allow such unsupervised meetings; their arranged marriages, Professor Heilman explained, are generally preceded by chats at home, under the watchful eye of parents. But a wide spectrum of young, observant and marriageable men and women can be found strolling through these grounds.</p>
        <p>The couple idling by the lily pond on this Sunday had already spent two hours here, wandering past the Japanese garden and the herb bushes reaching for the sun and the wide meadow now shaded by thick-leafed cherry trees. They had tried to go here on their first date a few days before, but a late-afternoon downpour sent them scurrying to the lounge at the Kennedy Airport Holiday Inn. Hotel lounges are also popular venues, though Formica tables hardly compete with the glories of creation.</p>
        <p>On this Sunday, for instance, a couple who had spent their first date at the ESPN Zone came bounding down the wisteria-covered aisle. ''It's nice, relaxed, beautiful,'' said Michael Blackman, 21, a ruddy-faced man visiting from Baltimore.</p>
        <p>''What's not to like?'' chirped his date, also 21, and decked out in a full-sleeved, ankle-length lacy black outfit.</p>
        <p>The woman did not want a newspaper reporter to learn too much about her -- her name, for example. After all, this was only her second date with this guy from Baltimore. Who knew whether it would last?</p>
