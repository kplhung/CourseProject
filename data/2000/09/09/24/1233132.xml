        <p>FRUSTRATED with traffic problems that grow worse even as billions of dollars are spent on road improvements, a coalition of elected officials, business leaders and commuter groups will try a radically new approach to developing a transportation plan in Connecticut at an all-day summit in West Hartford on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The meeting is likely to propose specific projects, its backers said, including the widening of Interstate 95 in the eastern part of the state, a better commuter rail link between New Haven and the Hartford-Springfield area, a better network of mass transit in Fairfield County, and the further development of Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks as a transportation hub.</p>
        <p>''The last time we took a substantive look at transportation in this state was when the Mianus River Bridge fell down, and it's time to do it again,'' said Christopher P. Bruhl, president of the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association. ''This is a real moment of decision. And if we don't do it right, the world will pass us by.''</p>
        <p>There are 2,349,051 licensed drivers in Connecticut, and almost all of them have their own cars, Federal Highway Administration statistics show, with each car traveling an average of 10,500 miles a year. And it feels as if they are all on I-95 at once.</p>
        <p>That highway, designed for 70,000 to 80,000 cars a day, is carrying 155,000 cars a day in the New Haven area and 150,000 in Bridgeport. The morning and afternoon rush hours are a well-known nightmare.</p>
        <p>And I-95 isn't the only problem. The Bureau of Planning at the State Department of Transportation said 40 percent of the state's limited access highways, and 20 percent of all other state highways, were classified as congested.</p>
        <p>''There is growing unanimity that if we don't do something it will choke off economic growth,'' said R. Nelson ''Oz'' Griebel, director of the Connecticut Regional Institute for the 21st Century, a research group, and a co-chairman of the meeting, called ''Strategic Solutions: From Gridlock to Growth.'' ''The summit is just another reflection of the fact that this issue is being taken ever more seriously from every side, not just the department of transportation but the business community, environmental groups, regional planning agencies, and a lot of other organizations.''</p>
        <p>But more important than specific projects, organizers of the summit said they are seeking to develop a process that will remove politics from decisions about which area gets a road or a bridge, a bus route or some rail lines. The state can no longer afford to think of public works projects as pork, because the transportation infrastructure is increasingly tied to economic development and quality of life, said State Representative Moira Lyons, the Democratic House Speaker who was chairwoman of the Transportation Committee for eight years.</p>
        <p>''We want a policy that takes all of the political infighting out of the process,'' Ms. Lyons said. ''In doing that, it may mean that the project in your area may not be the immediate priority. That doesn't necessarily mean that we won't get to it, it might just mean it takes longer. But we need a rational basis for these decisions.''</p>
        <p>Representatives of regional planning agencies, chambers of commerce, and councils of government from across the state have worked most of the summer on three committees to prepare for the summit, an invitation-only event where there are two people on a waiting list for every one of the about 800 people who are attending.</p>
        <p>Peter M. Gioia, an economist with the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said increasingly, there is a realization about how much transportation is tied to the economic health of a state.</p>
        <p>''When you look at where traffic flows are within Connecticut, an enormous obstacle for Connecticut businesses is getting into John F. Kennedy Airport or the Port of New Jersey, because there's such a bottleneck at the lower end of the state,'' he said. If that traffic could be redirected to Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, it would relieve some congestion.</p>
        <p>Already, backers of the summit said, some of the traditional political barriers are starting to fall. John C. Markowicz, executive director of the Southeastern Connecticut Enterprise Region, said that widening Interstate 95 to three lanes in each direction and completing Route 11 between Hartford and New London, and a few other priority items, will cost an estimated $1 billion. But groups in that region are working with their counterparts in southwestern Connecticut on a $1.5 billion plan for improving mass transit, and also working with the Hartford area on a $1.5 billion rail line along the Interstate 91 corridor.</p>
        <p>''Rather than everybody beating up on each other and trying to get their piece, we're saying we have a comprehensive plan, a $4 billion package deal,'' Mr. Markowicz said. ''The three corridors have put this on the table publicly, we have our councils of governments involved, and these are the priorities.''</p>
        <p>With federal funding, the package would require about $240 million a year for 10 years to cover the state's share.</p>
        <p>''The current surplus is more than that,'' Mr. Markowicz said. Or, an additional gasoline tax of 7 cents a gallon would generate $1 billion.</p>
        <p>''There may also be other sources of revenue. Let's have a debate, let's talk about it,'' Mr. Markowicz said. ''There will be people running around saying that it's too expensive. But the question you have to ask is, if we don't start today and we're stuck in traffic today on Interstate 95, what do you think it's going to be like in 10 years.''</p>
        <p>James J. Finley, associate director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, said even a statewide approach would be too limited.</p>
        <p>''Decisions that New York City and New York State make regarding bridges over the Hudson or rail lines will have a dramatic impact on Connecticut, and we need to make sure that they're taking into account the needs of the rest of New England and the northeast states,'' Mr. Finley said. Years ago when federal government changed its formula for financing of transportation, members of Congress from New England, New York and New Jersey formed a coalition to make sure money was not redirected out of the Northeast. ''That coalition needs to be revived.''</p>
        <p>Norman W. Garrick, director of the Connecticut Transportation Institute at the University of Connecticut, said some of the state's transportation problems could also be addressed by better land-use planning. Cities such as Portland, Ore., are trying to revitalize their core downtown districts, creating places where people want to work, shop and live. They are slowly creating enclaves where people don't need a car.</p>
        <p>''They faced the same argument you hear in Connecticut about people being wedded to their car, but it's changing,'' Dr. Garrick said. ''I think it could change here, too, but we need vision to start doing things differently.''</p>
        <p>One reason for the clogged highways: 96 percent of all travel to work is done by automobile, and 90 percent of work commuters travel in single-occupancy vehicles.</p>
        <p>''We only capture about 4 percent of commuting trips on transit, split about 2 percent on rail and 2 percent on bus,'' said Richard A. Martinez, the chief of the Bureau of Planning at the State Department of Transportation. ''We have high incomes in the state, so more people can afford to drive, and we tend to be more ruralized in our housing patterns.''</p>
        <p>People will use mass transit when it makes sense, however, Mr. Martinez said. About 80 percent of commuters into New York City take the train, because it is faster, and they can get a pass for a couple of hundred dollars, depending on where they pick it up, about half what they would pay for parking in the city.</p>
        <p>There are other factors adding to congestion, he said. The average trip on Interstate 95, for instance, is eight to nine miles, reflecting that people are using it for local trips. Currently, there are 48 interchanges in the 50 miles of highway from New York to Bridgeport, which allows that kind of use.</p>
        <p>Some battles are already shaping, such as the competition between commuters and freight haulers on the highway. Almost 80 percent of freight in Connecticut is moved on highways, and only 2 percent on rail. Some 12 to 13 percent of vehicles on Interstate 95 each day are trucks, the transportation department said, compared with 8 percent on Interstate 84 near Waterbury.</p>
        <p>One suggestion to come out of the process has been to establish rail hubs where trucks could pick up freight within the state, or to develop ports for ships to bring it in. But Michael J. Riley, president of the Motor Transport Association of Connecticut, which represents 1,200 companies, cautioned that shipping patterns can't change overnight.</p>
        <p>''I don't have any problem with the suggestions, except trains don't go to your front yard or to Stop &amp; Shop or to Home Depot,'' Mr. Riley said. ''The economy decides how things move, not government, and that's how it should be.''</p>
        <p>But any changes are likely to be controversial, he acknowledged.</p>
        <p>''The way trucks move on Interstate 95 just doesn't make sense. We're banned from operating in the left hand lane and we can't operate in the right hand lane, or we don't want to, because everyone is entering and exiting,'' Mr. Riley said. ''Let us operate in the left hand lane and you won't have this line of trucks moving down the middle of the highway.''</p>
        <p>For many years the charter of the transportation department has been to build and maintain roads and bridges as directed by the legislature, and it has done it well, Mr. Griebel said.</p>
        <p>''But we need to get them to think and act in a broader way, we need to look at the way we make decisions about transportation funding,'' Mr. Griebel said. ''You wind up with something where everybody gets a nickel along the way, but we don't spend the transportation dollar as well as it should be. We need to come up with a way to allow department to do its job as planners and engineers, to figure out what's best for the transportation system statewide, without any political heat.''</p>
