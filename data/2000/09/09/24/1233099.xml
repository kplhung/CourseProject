        <p>THE collapse of the Camp David summit in July has landed Arab-Israeli relations in a brand new state of flux.</p>
        <p>But as President Clinton sprints to move the peace process to a formal accord before he leaves office, one need look no farther than Westchester to see longstanding attempts to improve relations between Arab and Jew, though the centuries of strife half a world away have left a legacy of limits here too. These limits, though, are handled in a way that allows the alliances to forge on amiably and effectively.</p>
        <p>Fearing that problems in the Middle East might one day have reverberations here, the Westchester Jewish Conference, an umbrella group of Jewish organizations, began to meet with Arab groups in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Lester J. Millman, the conference's president and a White Plains resident, remembers a defining moment from one of his first meetings with the Islamic Society of Westchester and Rockland County.</p>
        <p>It was a time when the groups were ''truly just feeling each other out,'' no one having any idea whether the meetings would take on a tone of contentiousness or friendship. Mr. Millman's father had just died, and he remembers getting into his car on a rainy night, depressed over his father's death and apprehensive about the meeting.</p>
        <p>That changed when Mr. Millman arrived at the meeting and members of the Islamic Society dropped what they were doing to pray for Mr. Millman's father.</p>
        <p>''I took several moments to recover,'' Mr. Millman remembered.</p>
        <p>This year, when Syria's King Hafez al-Assad died, Mr. Millman reciprocated, sitting with the Islamic Society and other Arab groups at a memorial service. ''It was a sad chore that was gladly done,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That gesture was appreciated greatly by Joe Sayegh, a New Rochelle resident, who heads the Arab-American Foundation, an organization that also has a close working relationship with Mr. Millman's group. In 1994, when the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan was signed, the two groups convened in joint celebration.</p>
        <p>''We had a Champagne toast,'' Mr. Sayegh remembered, ''and congratulated each other.''</p>
        <p>With a difficult history as a backdrop, though, these alliances have hit consistent snags when it comes to discussion of Jerusalem. Here, as there, the issue is freighted with a difference of opinion so elemental and stark, so entwined with basic concerns for security and varying interpretations of history that, to say the very least, it does not lend itself to easy rapport.</p>
        <p>''Look,'' explained Mr. Sayegh, ''the Catholics have the Vatican, Muslims have Mecca, Jerusalem is for the Jews -- it's logical, but then again . . . '' His voice trailed off before he explained that Christians and Muslims have ties to the land too.</p>
        <p>Capitalizing on a luxury, however, that their counterparts in the Middle East don't have, these groups chose a course of studied avoidance. In short, they agree to disagree about Jerusalem, and then go forward acting together on common local concerns.</p>
        <p>When the County Board of Legislators was considering a law requiring law-enforcement officials to report bias crimes to a central authority, Mr. Sayegh and Mr. Millman lobbied together for its passage. First, their organizations issued a joint news release prominently featuring the letterheads of both groups on top. Then, Mr. Sayegh and Mr. Millman spoke to the legislature ''one right after the other,'' as they both proudly recall.</p>
        <p>The two groups also jointly sponsored a concert featuring Arab and Jewish performers and, along with the Yonkers chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., sponsored a commemoration of the birth of Martin Luther King Jr.  They also hold frequent strategy sessions. Mr. Millman described the interaction: ''We're always saying, 'What are you guys doing with this? With that?' And they're always asking the same of us.''</p>
        <p>True, what these groups have achieved is a small-scale peace, but it is a peace nonetheless. And while it is also true that this head-in-the-sand strategy on Jerusalem could not travel, it does not have to. But what about those times when conversation gets cavalier and the issue of Jerusalem pops up?</p>
        <p>Mr. Millman is adamant: ''We just cut it off and say let's not go there.'' They immediately re-route their collective focus to Westchester where, as Mr. Millman says: ''Everyone's an immigrant. And when we can help each other, we can help ourselves.''</p>
