        <p>WHENEVER a television camera peeks into the Yankees' dugout now, there's a different pitching coach next to Joe Torre. While Mel Stottlemyre is on medical leave to receive stem-cell treatments for bone-marrow cancer, Billy Connors is sitting in the dugout next to the manager, staring out at whichever Yankee is on the mound.</p>
        <p>''It's been a smooth transition,'' Torre said. ''Everybody is more concerned with Mel's welfare than with the changing of the guard.''</p>
        <p>That's because the pitchers know and respect Connors, who earlier this season supervised the installation of new psychological and strategic transmissions in Roger Clemens, Dwight Gooden, Orlando Hernandez and David Cone when each had to be towed into the Yankee garage in Tampa, Fla.</p>
        <p>''He's very honest,'' Gooden said. ''He tells you what you don't want to hear.''</p>
        <p>Connors is also the only one of the Yankees' 15 vice presidents who wears a pinstriped uniform; he's listed on the Yankee masthead as the vice president of player personnel in the baseball operations department in Tampa, where he has spent the last five years as a guru until he was summoned to be the Yankees' pitching coach.</p>
        <p>''As far as I'm concerned, this is Mel's staff,'' Connors said. ''I'm just here to keep things going until he comes back.''</p>
        <p>Connors is also helping to keep Stottlemyre going. He recently donated blood to be used in Stottlemyre's treatments, as did the bullpen coach Tony Cloninger, the trainer Steve Donohue and Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager. But Stottlemyre, who watches the Yankees on television, has kept in touch with Torre by phone.</p>
        <p>''The other day,'' Connors said, ''Mel told Joe, 'Denny Neagle was trying to make the ball sink instead of just letting it go.' Hey, that only helps Neagle and it only helps me.''</p>
        <p>But until Stottlemyre is healthy, Connors will be the new 58-year-old cherubic face in the dugout during the Yankees' quest for a third straight World Series championship as well as a fourth title in the last five years.</p>
        <p>''The big thing is, Billy knows all our pitchers,'' Torre said. ''And we made sure Billy was here before Mel left, so it wasn't an abrupt change.''</p>
        <p>Connors is special: the major leagues' only guru available during the season to advise pitchers on what amounts to a psychologist's couch away from the tension of the regular schedule. During his Tampa seances, he already had a great year. He resurrected Gooden, restored Clemens's aggressiveness, soothed Hernandez's mind-set and prolonged Cone's career.</p>
        <p>''Billy talked me off the ledge,'' Cone recalled.</p>
        <p>After having been battered repeatedly by big-league hitters, Cone wasn't any better pitching batting practice to minor-leaguers in Tampa when a line drive whistled past his eyes. He stalked off the mound, took a quick shower and drove to his nearby home.</p>
        <p>''It was the low point of my year,'' Cone said.</p>
        <p>Connors knew the feeling. He had a career 0-2 record with the Chicago Cubs and the Mets before developing into a pitching coach with the Kansas City Royals, the Cubs, the Seattle Mariners and the Yankees. He knew Cone was frustrated enough to quit right then and there. Still in his uniform that day in Tampa, he hurried to Cone's home.</p>
        <p>''David had tears in his eyes,'' Connors remembered. ''He thought he was done.''</p>
        <p>Connors persuaded Cone to have dinner that night with him and George Steinbrenner, who reminded Cone of others who wanted to quit but didn't and then succeeded, notably Len Dawson. Cut by the Cleveland Browns, Dawson went on to be a Hall of Fame quarterback with the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
        <p>''The next day,'' Connors recalled, ''David was ready to try some things.''</p>
        <p>Connors had Cone close his eyes and pitch. The idea was for Cone to try to visualize how he pitched when he was one of baseball's best.</p>
        <p>''He found out his hands should be farther away from his body,'' Connors said.</p>
        <p>Cone soon returned to the Yankees and was pitching better until he dislocated his left shoulder diving for a ball. Although he returned quickly from that injury, it reduced the velocity of his fastball. He remains a question mark for the postseason roster but has postponed any thought of quitting.</p>
        <p>''Billy has a good way about him,'' Cone said.</p>
        <p>Gooden agreed. After having been waived by both the Astros and the Devil Rays earlier this year, he appeared to be through until Connors convinced him that he was no longer a power pitcher, that he had to develop better control, get ahead of the batters, pitch in and out, spot his fastball, trust his breaking ball when behind in the count, and develop a screwball changeup.</p>
        <p>''He was over that ego hump,'' Connors said. ''He knew the Yankees were his last shot. He listened.''</p>
        <p>And now all the Yankees' pitchers are listening to their pitching coach pro tem, with the accent on pro.</p>
