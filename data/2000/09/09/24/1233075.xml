        <p>IN the second debate of his 1984 re-election campaign, Ronald Reagan was reminded by Henry Trewhitt, then the diplomatic correspondent of The Baltimore Sun, that he was ''already the oldest president in history.'' Mr. Trewhitt asked whether he had any doubts about his capacity to function effectively on little sleep during a national emergency like the Cuban missile crisis.</p>
        <p>''Not at all,'' the president blithely replied, ''and Mr. Trewhitt, I want you to know also, I will not make age an issue in this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.''</p>

        <p>IN the second debate of his 1984 re-election campaign, Ronald Reagan was reminded by Henry Trewhitt, then the diplomatic correspondent of The Baltimore Sun, that he was ''already the oldest president in history.'' Mr. Trewhitt asked whether he had any doubts about his capacity to function effectively on little sleep during a national emergency like the Cuban missile crisis.</p>
        <p>''Not at all,'' the president blithely replied, ''and Mr. Trewhitt, I want you to know also, I will not make age an issue in this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.''</p>
        <p>People all across the country laughed at Mr. Reagan's two-liner, but at the time few considered it decisive. The man at whom the barb was aimed, Walter F. Mondale, Mr. Reagan's Democratic opponent, was an important exception, we learn in ''Debating Our Destiny: Forty Years of Presidential Debates,'' a lively, two-hour PBS special that has its premiere tonight.</p>
        <p>''He got the audience with that,'' Mr. Mondale tells the program's host, Jim Lehrer. ''I could tell that one hurt. I walked off and I was almost certain the campaign was over, and it was.''</p>
        <p>That kind of candid, unsparing response, so different from the evasion and obfuscation most politicians habitually deploy in the heat of partisan combat, is the hallmark of the program. It includes interviews with about a dozen participants in presidential and vice presidential debates in campaigns past, along with compelling moments from many of the debates themselves.</p>
        <p>''Everything they said had the ring of credibility about it,'' said Mr. Lehrer, who conducted all the interviews. ''No game-playing at all.''</p>
        <p>With televised presidential debates once again big political news, the program's timing is ideal. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee, tried for several weeks to circumvent the bipartisan commission that has run the debates for a dozen years, hoping to effect radical changes in the dates, the number and the format of the series. He failed, largely because he looked as if he was trying to insulate himself from Vice President Al Gore's debating skills.</p>
        <p>The American voter doesn't much like chickens, and such was the picture of himself Mr. Bush was projecting. It was a major league blunder. So he reconsidered, backed off and accepted the commission's terms. The first of three debates will be Oct. 3 in Boston.</p>
        <p>That episode, like the documentary evidence Mr. Lehrer has accumulated in his interviews, conducted over a 10-year-period, demonstrated just how deeply debates and television have wormed their way into the American political tradition. We tell ourselves that we are a nation of laws, but our political system is shaped as much by habit and party rules as by statute. No law requires a state to hold presidential primaries or caucuses, no law stipulates that nominees be chosen at conventions and no law regulates presidential debates -- yet those are the main events in the process of selecting a president.</p>
        <p>And the rise of television has transformed American politics. Unlike many European countries, the United States allows a free market in short, often superficial, political commercials, which have unquestionably coarsened our political discourse. Debates, in the meantime, at the state as well as national levels, often offer the less-known candidate his or her only real chance to win.</p>
        <p>BUT do the debates distort reality, or illuminate it? Genuine clashes of ideas -- real debates in the Oxford style -- are rare; more often, the candidates, determined to stay ''on message,'' offer only slightly modified versions of their packaged positions. Journalists, the semi-official scorers, deliver snap judgments that inevitably influence the electorate. Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Douglas would not recognize these televised affairs as the lineal descendants of their bouts, which seeped rather than slammed into the public consciousness.</p>
        <p>Still, without the debates, American politics might well be even more mindless than it now is.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehrer, who has moderated six presidential debates, including all three in 1996, and who will moderate all three this year, draws no conclusions in the program about the efficacy or the desirability of the debates, which have been criticized by some historians and political scientists for skittering too glibly across the political surface, subordinating serious issues to point-scoring and gaffe-avoidance.</p>
        <p>''That was a conscious decision,'' he told me earlier this month. ''I decided this was a time to let the participants speak for themselves.</p>
        <p>''My own view, which is worth about the same as anyone else's, is that the politicians are stuck with this now. They have to do it. Nationally televised debates play a big part in the electoral process, for good or for ill. I think that's a healthy thing.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton tells Mr. Lehrer in an interview that he is convinced debates helped him be a better president. He adds: ''They force you to come to terms with what you really believe because if you get into a big fight in a debate, unless you are the world's greatest actor, it's hard to sit there and defend a position in a convincing way that you don't believe.''</p>
        <p>Of course, Mr. Clinton is an accomplished debater, especially in the town meeting format used in the second debate in 1992. ''I love those things, and I loved that one,'' he says. ''I think I did very well there.''</p>
        <p>It turns out that Governor Bush's seeming aversion to debates reflects, like so much else in his campaign, the views of his father, the former president George Bush, a man who has never been possessed of noteworthy fluency.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Lehrer asks the elder Mr. Bush whether debates should be ''a required part of the process,'' he replies: ''Nope. I think you ought to do what's best to get you elected. And if that's best that you have no debates, too bad for all you debate-lovers. If there was a guy that couldn't, say, couldn't finish a sentence and yet is a brilliant contribution as a public servant or an academic or whatever, why should that one thing be mandatory? Why should a person be burdened with that decision to have to debate?''</p>
        <p>''I was glad when the damn thing was over,'' Mr. Bush says of the town meeting debate, during which he twice looked at his watch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush complains that he had been set up, telling Mr. Lehrer: ''Beforehand they had rehearsed and identified some of the questioners, and there was some guy that was, you know, so clearly was going to be antagonistic to me. And the way the questions were asked, and I was told later, that how about you back there in the fourth row, and they singled him out to be the contentious questioner of George Bush.''</p>
        <p>But after listening to part of his performance in a vice-presidential debate against Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, he is in a sunnier mood.</p>
        <p>This is what he said then: ''Almost every place you can point, contrary to Mr. Mondale's -- I gotta be careful -- but contrary of how he goes around saying everything bad. If he sees . . . if somebody sees a silver lining, he finds a big black cloud out there. Whine on harvest moon! I mean, there's a lot going on, a lotta opportunity.''</p>
        <p>And this is what he says now: ''I was the guy who just said English was my second language, so maybe. . . .''</p>
        <p>Several erstwhile debaters compare the experience to a sporting event. Mr. Bush says it was ''like a ball game,'' in a way; the former president Jimmy Carter says he went in ''as though it was an athletic competition,'' and the former president Gerald R. Ford, harking back explicitly to his gridiron days at the University of Michigan, says, ''I was anxious to get into the ball game.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehrer begins at the beginning, with the 1960 debate, which was watched by 60 million to 70 million people and introduced a young and virile John F. Kennedy to the nation while showing a flu-ridden, poorly made up Richard M. Nixon. Bob Dole recalls listening to it on his car radio and thinking that Nixon was winning; only when Mr. Dole saw the television replay did he realize that Kennedy ''wiped him out.''</p>
        <p>AFTER that, televised debates disappeared from the American political landscape until 1976. Neither Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 nor Nixon in 1968 and 1972 thought they had anything to gain by debating. Then, by 1976, Watergate, Vietnam, assassinations and other experiences had changed forever the way Americans viewed their government. Many deeply distrusted it, and debates came to be seen as a useful tool in restoring confidence in the political process.</p>
        <p>In 1976, Mr. Carter was grilled about the infamous Playboy interview, in which he confessed to having ''committed adultery in my heart many times,'' and Mr. Ford astonishingly asserted that ''there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.'' That same year in a vice-presidential debate, Mr. Dole described World War I, World War II (in which he was grievously wounded) and Korea as ''Democrat wars.'' In retrospect, all three came to believe their missteps had cost them votes, and his mistake, Mr. Dole says, ''made me more cautious in future debates.''</p>
        <p>Ronald Reagan scored in 1980 by telling Mr. Carter, ''There you go again,'' when Mr. Carter criticized his record on Medicare. It showed, Mr. Carter confesses to Mr. Lehrer, ''that he was relaxed and had a sense of humor, and it was kind of a denigrating thing to me.'' And Mr. Reagan scored again at the end when he told voters, ''It might be well if you ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago?''</p>
        <p>But four years later, in Louisville, Ky., Mr. Reagan did badly against Mr. Mondale. In his own acount, given in 1990, he was too prepared -- in contrast to Adm. James Stockdale, Ross Perot's running mate in 1996, who tells Mr. Lehrer that he learned only a week before the debate that he was to take part, was given no briefing papers or briefing books, and in fact ''never had a single conversation about politics with Ross Perot in my life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan spent months getting ready.</p>
        <p>''I just had more facts and figures poured at me than anyone could possibly sort out and use, and I call it overtraining,'' he says. ''When I got there I realized that I was racking my brain so much for facts and figures on whatever subject we were talking about.''</p>
        <p>As evidence, Mr. Lehrer's researchers unearthed this gem of incoherence from that debate: ''7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings, 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.''</p>
        <p>''I knew I didn't do well,'' Mr. Reagan tells Mr. Lehrer -- but he did better the next time out, thanks to Mr. Trewhitt and his own quick-wittedness.</p>
        <p>Which suggests a moral, I suppose: If you're going to mess up, mess up early when you can still recover.</p>
