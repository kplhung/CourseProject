        <p>THERE is nothing quite like the feeling of walking into a dark movie theater enveloped by the scent of fresh popcorn, sitting in a plush chair and losing yourself in a film.</p>
        <p>Imagine working in a theater, seeing it from the inside out, knowing the machinations -- selling the tickets, grilling the franks, cleaning wads of gum off Coke-sticky floors. According to many who work in cineplexes, the magic is still there.</p>

        <p>THERE is nothing quite like the feeling of walking into a dark movie theater enveloped by the scent of fresh popcorn, sitting in a plush chair and losing yourself in a film.</p>
        <p>Imagine working in a theater, seeing it from the inside out, knowing the machinations -- selling the tickets, grilling the franks, cleaning wads of gum off Coke-sticky floors. According to many who work in cineplexes, the magic is still there.</p>
        <p>The routine is basically the same for all United Artists employees, whether it is Angel Robles at a new 10-screen multiplex in Farmingdale or Roger Yen at a 150-year-old duplex in Darien, Conn. Eileen Sullivan in Cortland, N.Y., and Lou Goncey in Moorestown, N.J., also follow the same schedule.</p>
        <p>The managers and assistants arrive at least an hour early to inventory each theater. They keep a checklist of things that need work -- a space under an exit door could let rodents in, a curtain on a side wall appears worn, an armrest is stuck.</p>
        <p>Soon the crew arrives. Ticket sellers set up their banks and computers and check local papers to ensure that show times are correct. Their world looks safe, protected, but they are the first line against a the public. People present the wrong credit cards to pick up tickets ordered by phone, young teenagers try to get into R-rated movies, and the line wraps around the block for the new ''Star Wars'' and fans are irate when they cannot score seats to the sold-out show. Life inside the ticket booth turns from secure to claustrophobic.</p>
        <p>At the Cortland concession stand, as in other theaters, they have to count every cup, every popcorn bag. In Farmingdale, frankfurters need to be grilled, cookies baked and pizza cooked. In Moorestown, they prepare pretzel bites. Cortland heats up nachos. The Darien theater sells only candy and popcorn.</p>
        <p>And, of course, that popcorn needs to be popped. About 15 minutes before the first show, volcanic puffs of popped corn come gurgling out of the steel poppers. The smells of popcorn and frankfurters waft through the theater.</p>
        <p>''That's what it's all about,'' Mr. Robles said. ''Getting that aroma out there.''</p>
        <p>One-third of a theater's revenue is from concessions, he said. His theater sells 180 franks, 600 boxes of cookies and more than 9,000 cups of soda a week. Cortland sells 3,400 bags of popcorn weekly.</p>
        <p>The ushers stand at their posts. Their job is to direct people to the various theaters, occasionally patrol the theaters for trouble and prevent patrons from sneaking between theaters. They are there to remind you that a ticket is not for an all-day admission, and, yes, ''Keep those feet off the chair!'' Managers like Mr. Robles, Mr. Goncey, Ms. Sullivan and Mr. Yen (an assistant manager) all started as ushers and concessionaires.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robles, 25, began as a concession attendant nine years ago. Mr. Goncey, 34, started working for theaters 14 years ago, ripping tickets. Ms. Sullivan, 32, began seven years ago buttering popcorn.</p>
        <p>Many employees come on board because they love movies.''It is like seeing the man behind the curtain in Oz, but I get to see everything that comes out,'' Mr. Goncey said. ''As a kid my dad used to take me to movies all the time, and everyone tries to recapture that kind of experience.''</p>
        <p>Nick Daley, 20, of Peekskill, is a Cortland theater cashier. He loves movies and tries to catch bits and pieces on his breaks. ''The one problem with that, though, is when things are slow and I get a chance to catch a movie, there aren't many people in the theater, and you lose the audience reactions. Also, sometimes when it's a small crowd they also get a little rowdy.'' Still, the mystique of the moviegoing experience has not been lost on him.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sullivan, whose three-room apartment is plastered with ''about 80 movie posters,'' agreed. She has seen about 100 films in her two years at Cortland.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goncey said the only negative thing about working in a theater is that he is sick of popcorn.</p>
        <p>In a top-floor room along the rear of the theater is the projectionist, busily setting up his cameras. In Farmingdale, George Constandakis splices the short reels together and sets them up on platters. The rest of the day is spent supervising his computer setup, making sure there are no hitches. There are buttons for pre-show music, coming attractions, ads, announcements and the films themselves. It runs like clockwork.</p>
        <p>In Cortland, which has 11 screens, a projectionist is hired, but in Darien and Moorestown, managers and assistant managers run the projectors. Mr. Yen, 26, learned the job from his brother.</p>
        <p>As a recovery time from summer blockbusters, fall is a slow time for movies. When ''The Replacements'' opened in Farmingdale, a dozen people were there for the half-price matinee. ''Pokemon,'' most theater personnel recall, was the opposite -- lines down the block, all day long.</p>
        <p>''Movies like 'Pokemon' is a manager's dream, but an usher's nightmare,'' Mr. Goncey said. ''Children's movies drive concessions, but they're hell to clean up after.''</p>
        <p>People scurry to the concession counter, buying big buckets of popcorn and giant sodas. They snuggle into their seats (comfy rocking chairs in Farmingdale and Cortland) and hunker down for a couple of hours of fantasy.. Many older couples attend the matinees, but there are also groups of teenagers, families, fathers with sons and the assorted solo act.</p>
        <p>''What other form of entertainment allows you to lose yourself like this, in front of a large screen, while you are with friends or family?'' Mr. Goncey said. ''Movies are a special form of entertainment that can't be matched by watching television or renting videos.''</p>
        <p>The lights dim and the audience is transfixed. Communally, they laugh at the funny bits, wipe their eyes at the sad parts and jump when it is scary. Some even converse with the on-screen characters.</p>
        <p>''There is definitely much more talking in the theater now than 10 years ago,'' Mr. Goncey said. ''People are just so used to being home, yelling back at their TV.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, patrons are disruptive, and managers have to deal with noise, crying babies and cell phones. ''We just have to make our presence known,'' Mr. Goncey said.</p>
        <p>Kareem Lee, a Farmingdale usher, said the crowd changed depending on the movie. ''Gladiator'' brought in a very aggressive crowd, he said. He likes comedies because the audiences are usually nicer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robles gets to see new films on Thursday nights, when the managers are required to check out new releases to make sure the print is good. Ms. Sullivan rarely misses that opportunity at her theater. Mr. Goncey goes to movies ''all the time'' and watches  DVD's on his 53-inch television screen at home.</p>
        <p>''We are entertainers in a way,'' Gary Koobrick, Mr. Robles's district manager,  said. ''We give people a place to go and give them a pleasant experience. I'm entertaining 1,000 people a night.''</p>
        <p>While movie theaters expand, they add smaller screens and better sound, higher ticket prices and gourmet snacks, but one thing stays constant, whether it is in a landmark building like the 500-capacity Darien theater or the generic 2,100-capacity Farmingdale theater: the moviegoing experience -- the ability to escape the world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goncey said one other ritual remains unchanged -- nervous teenagers on first dates. ''The guy will act cocky, but he's scared to death,'' he said. ''And then he'll try that yawning thing to get his arm around her. Yes, it still goes on. But it's a nice way to have a date, because you don't have to talk, and when it's over you have something to talk about.''</p>
