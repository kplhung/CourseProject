        <p>OFFICE vacancies are approaching record lows and rental rates reaching record highs in Manhattan. Despite the demand, there is no speculative construction in the city, with the few buildings that are being constructed substantially preleased before a shovel went into the ground.</p>
        <p>Across the Hudson River along the New Jersey waterfront, buildings are being occupied as fast as they can be built as securities firms are moving their back-office operations one stop west of Manhattan on the PATH rail line. Even in Westchester, which has tended to lag the rest of the area in occupancy, growth by local companies is filling up long-vacant space.</p>
        <p>The business of leasing to retailers in New York is booming, with areas like 14th Street and Madison Avenue in the upper 20's attracting new attention. The city's hotels are packed despite the addition of new rooms.</p>
        <p>The real estate business in the metropolitan area is in the midst of a period of prosperity so extended that it has prompted people with long memories to ask ''How long can this go on?''</p>
        <p>The consensus answer appears to be: For the next two or three years at least, provided the national economy does not swoon. With lenders still exerting firm discipline on developers, there is little danger of overbuilding and even slowed growth is still growth, which means more jobs and a need for space to put people.</p>
        <p>''I must tell you this all makes me very nervous, but I can't see any clouds in the sky,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, vice chairman of Insignia/ESG, the real estate services company. She said that history demonstrates every upsurge in rental rates and property prices has been followed by a downturn, but that in the current market ''there is no new supply and demand is overwhelming.''</p>
        <p>According to a report by Insignia/ESG, the vacancy rate in Manhattan is under 4 percent for the first time in memory, and the average asking rental for all transactions of more than 10,000 square feet at midyear was $48.66, which the report describes as an all-time high. (A year ago it was $38.43.)</p>
        <p>Internet-related companies, which did not exist a few years ago, were the largest leasers of new space in the first half of this year, accounting for 20 percent of the total, up from 3 percent a year earlier. The city's traditional mainstay, the financial industry, was nudged out of first place, accounting for 19.8 percent of space leased.</p>
        <p>The growth of this new industry and the consequent diversification of the city's economy have some people suggesting that the rules have changed and that the old boom-and-bust real estate economy has been permanently changed. ''New York's real estate industry has had its share of busts and booms over the past few decades, but the current real estate cycle is unlike any other seen since the dawn of the industrial age,'' said a report prepared by Colliers ABR, a real estate services company. ''The abundance of current economic and real estate data suggests that not only does this recovery still have room to grow, but that the real estate cycles as most people remember them may be a thing of the past.''</p>
        <p>But many seasoned executives said they were not ready to accept a relentlessly rosy future. ''Something is going to happen -- it always does,'' said Steven Swerdlow, executive managing director for the eastern division of CB Richard Ellis, the brokerage and services company. He said if the national economy were mismanaged, interest rates could soar and the value of stocks decline.</p>
        <p>''We could have a hard landing rather than a soft one and a plunge in the stock market,'' he said. ''New York is much more sensitive to the stock market than other cities.''</p>
        <p>Barry Gosin, chief executive of Newmark &amp; Company Real Estate, a brokerage and management company, said New York is much more sensitive to faraway events then it once was because of the links among financial markets.</p>
        <p>''It will probably be something that nobody predicted,'' he said. ''Some event somewhere in the world will have an impact here.'' He recalled that problems with foreign currencies and the near-collapse of a large investment fund roiled capital markets in the fall of 1998, including the one for commercial mortgage-backed securities. This dried up financing for sales transactions and put a temporary cap on the prices offered for properties.</p>
        <p>Indeed, some real estate executives argue that the stumble in 1998 helped to prolong the good times by squelching any possibility of a new wave of speculative building. Such a wave of building in the mid- and late 1980's prolonged the downturn of the early 1990's by bringing large blocks of new office space to a market where demand was dropping.</p>
        <p>''We might have had lending for speculative building but for the crunch of the fall of 1998 and early 1999,'' said Robert Billingsley, an executive vice president of Colliers. ''That gave pause to potentially irrational behavior and in hindsight was a good thing.''</p>
        <p>Other executives added other notes of wariness. Anthony E. Malkin, the president of W&amp;M Properties, an investor and development company, said: ''Whatever happens to change the market will be unexpected. You have a situation where the average apartment in Manhattan costs over $700,000. How is that sustainable? There is inevitably going to be a shakeout.''</p>
        <p>Bruce E. Mosler, the president for United States operations for Cushman &amp; Wakefield,  the brokerage and services company, said he expected the real estate cycle to endure, but with the peaks not as high and the valleys not as low as before.</p>
        <p>''We are still adding jobs in the city, which means growth, even if we will slow to about 75,000 new jobs this year from 89,000 in 1999,'' he said. He predicted the remaining industrial property on the far west side of Manhattan would be redeveloped and the exodus to New Jersey would continue.</p>
        <p>Because developers still cannot get financing for speculative building, he said, any such projects will be of modest size. ''You have to tie up too much equity to do a one million square foot building, so if there is any speculative building, it will be in the 150,000 to 300,000 square foot range,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although space will remain scarce, the recent run-up in rents may not be sustainable, some executives say. ''The rise in rents will have to level off because they are beginning to run into people's ability to pay,'' said Mr. Swerdlow. He said small and medium-size service organizations, like law firms, would be forced to leave the city or to enter into unwanted mergers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gosin agrees. ''We are getting to a point where some tenants cannot afford the rent,'' he said. ''There are high-margin businesses and low-margin business, and it is the low-margin service companies that are being affected.''</p>
        <p>Some corporate executives, political officials and urban planners fear that allowing economics to force certain types of business out of the city could unbalance the economic mix and make it difficult to attract new businesses. Some are trying to devise incentive programs that would keep the companies pushed out of Manhattan in the city by encouraging development in the boroughs outside of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Some real estate executives say that rents will continue to increase in locations that are considered desirable and that the tenants who are unable to pay will consider moving across the Hudson or to other areas of the city.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tighe pointed to the recent decision by a publishing house, John Wiley &amp; Sons, to leave its longtime location on Third Avenue at 39th Street for a new building to be developed in Hoboken by SJP Properties. Wiley will move 800 people into 400,000 square feet of the building, which is expected to be completed in early 2002.</p>
        <p>''That company was in Manhattan for 94 years, but Hoboken is only one stop away on the PATH train,'' Ms. Tighe said. ''What is happening is that the boundaries of the city are being redefined. There was a time when downtown was dead; now downtown is wonderful. There were other areas that were considered unacceptable; now the island is seamless from 60th street south.''</p>
        <p>This process of adding outlying areas to what tenants perceive as the central business district continues with each up cycle, she continued. ''It took several cycles,'' she said, ''to establish Metrotech in Brooklyn and the Jersey coast,'' referring to the west bank of the Hudson River. ''Maybe this is the cycle that makes Long Island City acceptable.''</p>
        <p>Although Long Island City in Queens is closer to the east side of Manhattan than the New Jersey riverfront is and has good transportation links, its buildings are mostly former factories or distribution centers and not as attractive as the new buildings going up in Jersey City and Hoboken.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the area has been designated by planners for decades as the site of the fourth concentration of office space, after midtown and downtown Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''Queens is probably next,'' said Ross Moskowitz, a partner in the law firm of Stroock, Stroock &amp; Lavan and a former official of the city's Economic Development Corporation. ''Queens West is ready for bid, with two million square feet of commercial space with retail and entertainment components,'' he said, referring to the waterfront development jointly controlled by the city, state and Port Authority. ''The project is ready to go, and I expect that we will see active bidding.''</p>
        <p>The strong rental market is being reflected in the price of buildings being sold, said James D. Kuhn, the president of Newmark. He said that Class A buildings -- the newest, most modern buildings -- were selling at more than $400 a square feet in Manhattan, compared with $300 a square foot just a few years ago. He noted that Equity Office Properties, whose chairman is Sam Zell, the Chicago-based real estate investor, paid more than $400 a square foot for the building at 1301 Avenue of the Americas at 52nd Street.</p>
        <p>''Sam Zell was a bottom fisher in the early 90's,'' buying distressed properties at low prices, Mr. Kuhn said. ''Now he has sent a signal to the marketplace that rent levels in New York are sustainable.''</p>
        <p>Some blockbuster deals are likely in the coming year, he said, with Rockefeller Center, the World Trade Center, the Seagram Building and other trophies on the block in one fashion or another. He predicted that a New York area real estate investment trust would eventually win the bidding for Rockefeller Center. ''That is the best real estate in the world,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Following are descriptions of the state of the market in other sectors:</p>
        <p>The Suburbs  A Riverfront Boom In New Jersey</p>
        <p>The western shore of the Hudson River facing Manhattan is in the throes of development as Wall Street companies are building space for their back office operations that support the money-making front office activities that are still in Manhattan. And the buildings are filling up as fast as they can be built or renovated.</p>
        <p>''We have no space,'' said Seena Stein, president of Newmark's New Jersey operations. ''The vacancy rate in Class A on the waterfront is 0.2 percent, and rents are at a record high of $36.25 a square foot.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stein said anyone wanting space on the waterfront would have to wait at least a year until a construction project is finished. She said this delay has pushed some deals west to Newark, the next stop on the PATH line.</p>
        <p>One big New York financial house that is changing the skyline in Jersey City is the Goldman Sachs Group, which purchased land in Colgate Center near the southern end of the city's waterfront across the water from the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>The group plans to build three structures totaling about three million square feet of space. Work is already under way on the first building, which will have about 1.3 million square feet of space.</p>
        <p>Merrill Lynch and Chase Bank are also expanding their support operations in Jersey City, and each could eventually have thousands of employees working across the Hudson from Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Development spread north to Hoboken this year, when the Wiley deal was signed in August. The publisher will occupy one of two SJP Properties in what is being called the Waterfront Corporate Center. The development is to include offices, retail space, a hotel and housing.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in New Jersey the office market is strong, but the obstacles to development are preventing any hint of overbuilding, said Donald Eisen, the director of the suburban operations of Cushman &amp; Wakefield. In New Jersey, ''you have a market of about 150 million square feet of space and maybe one to two million square feet going up,'' he said. ''That's minuscule.''</p>
        <p>He said he hoped efforts to develop established cities like Jersey City, Hoboken and Newark represented a trend that might halt or slow the endless sprawl of development across the state. ''New Jersey needs to push development where the infrastructure is -- and that is in urban areas,'' he said. ''You just have to be creative.''</p>
        <p>He said one good example of creative redevelopment was the conversion of an old IT&amp;T industrial site along Route 3 in Essex County to a new shopping mall called Clifton Commons.</p>
        <p>Westchester County, which had appeared to be lagging behind the rest of the metropolitan area in leasing activity, is experiencing an upsurge as locally based companies began to expand. Some real estate executives said the vacancy statistics in the county had been distorted by the presence of former corporate headquarters buildings that have been difficult to divide for new tenants.</p>
        <p>''There are buildings like the former Kraft headquarters that add 500,000 square feet to the vacancy numbers, but don't reflect what is actually happening in the market,'' said Kenneth M. Krasnow, a regional managing director at Cushman &amp; Wakefield. ''Westchester suffered a lot from corporate downsizing, but now homegrown companies are beginning to take space. The company that had 5,000 or 10,000 square feet of space three or four years ago now needs 25,000 to 30,000 square feet.''</p>
        <p>Jeffrey H. Newman, an executive vice president of W&amp;M Properties, which owns 1.5 million square feet of property in Westchester County and Fairfield County in Connecticut, said, ''Companies like Sara Lee and Chock Full o' Nuts have been leaving Manhattan and moving to Westchester.'' .</p>
        <p>He said his company had concentrated in buying existing buildings and then renovating them to bring them up to Class A standards. In White Plains, ''at 500 Mamaroneck  we had to pull shag carpeting off the walls,'' Mr. Malkin, the president of W&amp;M Properties, said.</p>
        <p>As vacancies have diminished, rental rates have risen, although they are still low compared with Manhattan. ''Space that was renting for $17 a square foot a year or so ago is now $26 to $30 a square foot,'' Mr. Newman said.</p>
        <p>Long Island, Mr. Krasnow said, is in the midst of a transition from defense companies to a new high-tech economy. The buildings that once housed companies making airplanes and other military goods are being transformed into locations for software and telecommunications organizations.</p>
        <p>Retail  Retailers Try Areas Previously Shunned</p>
        <p>Retailers are balking at paying higher rents in fashionable areas of Manhattan and instead are looking for stores in areas once considered less desirable, brokers specializing in store leasing said. According to a survey conducted by Garrick-Aug Associates, the average asking rent at midyear was $77.50 a square foot, up just 0.6 percent from $77 a square foot in the first six months of 1999.</p>
        <p>''Rents are at all-time highs, and people don't want to look stupid, especially the national chains,'' said Faith H. Consolo, vice chairman of Garrick-Aug. ''So they are looking at new areas, such as Madison Avenue north of Madison Square Park.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Consolo said this area was bolstered by the decision by Credit Suisse First Boston to move into the building at 11 Madison Avenue at 25th Street, the influx of new restaurants and the renovation of hotels. ''What happened to the Flatiron district is moving north,'' she said, referring to the area near the famous triangular building at 23rd Street and Broadway.</p>
        <p>''I have had retailers asking me to look at locations on 14th Street,'' said Alan Victor, an executive vice president of the Lansco Corporation, a retail broker. ''They want to be there because they think it is new and fresh and young.''</p>
        <p>He said retailers are looking at places like 14th Street, which was known in the past for its downscale stores, because the rents in preferred locations have become prohibitive. ''You are talking $600 a square foot on Madison Avenue and $500 to $600 a square foot on Fifth Avenue, if you can find it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said retailers often had a difficult time negotiating with landlords because there were multiple bidders for space.</p>
        <p>Hotels  Occupancy Jumps, Along With Prices</p>
        <p>Even though the millennium was a bit of a bust for hotel owners and operators, with demand well below what some had hoped for, occupancy rates in the city's hotels remained near historic highs and revenues grew quickly as room rates rose.</p>
        <p>''We have seen revenue growth of an average of 13 percent in the first half of this year and 20 percent in some segments of the market,'' said Sean Hennessey, director of the New York hospitality and leisure practice of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm.</p>
        <p>The occupancy rate at midyear was 89.2 percent, up from 82.9 percent a year earlier. And analysts say the strong statistics do not fully reflect the intensity of demand, because many hotels are so full on some nights they have to turn away prospective guests. ''I had some clients come into town, and they had to stay in Stamford because there was nothing available for them in the city,'' Mr. Hennessey said.</p>
        <p>Although some 1,400 hotel rooms have recently been added to the city's supply of approximately 70,000, the unceasing demand has pushed up daily rates. The average daily rate at midyear was $215.55, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, up from $200.23 a year earlier.</p>
        <p>As an indication of how far New York is ahead of the rest of the country, the firm reported that the average daily rate nationally is $84.51.</p>
