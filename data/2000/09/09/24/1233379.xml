        <p>An opulent mansion drenched in sex and money, where business and bedroom adventures abound, the over-the-top saga of a twisted, dysfunctional family.</p>
        <p>It's not ''Titans,'' the new Aaron Spelling soap opera on NBC. It's ''Clintons'' in D.C.</p>
        <p>The White House finally released the list of overnight guests at the White House and Camp David since Hillary Clinton began campaigning in New York in July 1999.</p>
        <p>And -- no surprise -- a herd of Hillary's donors has been stampeding through the White House in pj's and calling friends from the Lincoln Bedroom.</p>
        <p>Why should she care if people trample the place? She doesn't even live there anymore.</p>
        <p>It's a national embarrassment to have a president and first lady who  never stop rattling their tin cups.</p>
        <p>The First Couple have not repented their 1996 fund-raising outrages, when they sold Air Force One, the Lincoln Bedroom and lots and lots of coffee.</p>
        <p>Past presidents were content selling ambassadorships. The Clintons may as well have listed the Lincoln Bedroom on eBay. Lately, they have packed state dinners with politicians, donors and journalists they hope will boost Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign. They even put up circus tents on the lawn for the India state dinner. They have to jam them in fast -- only 118 days left to peddle the People's House.</p>
        <p>How can they can spend so much time in this awesome mansion, blessedly haunted by the highest-class ghosts in American history, and have none of it rub off?</p>
        <p>They do not grasp the notion of the White House as a hallowed place where hustling is off-limits. They're more into a ''Titans'' philosophy --  What if you had everything, and still wanted more?</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton gives a whole new meaning to the term ''hostess gift.'' Guests at Motel 1600, who sometimes even stayed when Hillary was out of town, gave $108,000 to her Senate campaign and $516,000 to related fund-raising committees. All in all, they gave nearly $5.5 million to the Democrats in this election cycle.</p>
        <p>Campaigning in Westchester on Friday, Mrs. Clinton defended the Oldest Established Permanent Floating Slumber Party in D.C., calling overnighters ''friends and supporters.''</p>
        <p>The Clintons have slowly and steadily redefined the nature of friendship so that its highest expression becomes the writing of a check.</p>
        <p>How could someone who wrote a $100,000 check for Hillary and a $500,000 check for the Democrats, as S. Daniel Abraham, the billionaire Slim-Fast founder, did, not be considered a friend?</p>
        <p>Some of the donor/friends were listed under the category ''Arts and Letters and Sports.'' There were no letters, unless you count former CNN executive and Clinton sympathizer  Rick Kaplan. And the ''arts'' were represented by Kenny G and Chevy Chase. The Clintons made friends in Hollywood because Hollywood gives the Clintons a lot of money.</p>
        <p>Terry McAuliffe was listed on the ''Longtime Friends'' list. For the first time in history, the president's best  fund-raiser became the president's best friend. Mr. McAuliffe has raised money for Bill's campaigns, legal defense fund and presidential library, and Hillary's Senate campaign. The Clintons barely knew him before coming to Washington, but Mr. McAuliffe was willing to write a $1.35 million check so they could qualify for a mortgage in Chappaqua. When the president strode on stage at the L.A. convention, following the transcendentally cheesy Gladiator Walk, the only person he hugged was his pal Terry.</p>
        <p>Although Bill Clinton calls public service his only calling, that bear hug with Mr. McAuliffe illustrated how the president has mixed money and politics. After all, the lawyers and pollsters and admen -- and even plaintiffs like Paula Jones -- need to get paid.</p>
        <p>The Clintons complained during the Lewinsky scandal that their critics did not appreciate the difference between public and private. But they are the ones who relentlessly blur public and private. Their donors are their friends and their friends are their donors. They used our capital to accumulate their capital.</p>
        <p>Harry Truman said, If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog. The Clintons have changed it to, If you want a friend in Washington, get a donor.</p>
