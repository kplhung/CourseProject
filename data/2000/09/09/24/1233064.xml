        <p>NO MORE MYSTERY MEAT  Not since the Reagan administration tried to classify ketchup as a vegetable has there been such commotion surrounding school lunches. The federal government has imposed strict new inspection standards on the ground beef it buys for schools, usually 100 million pounds per year. The tests, for salmonella and E. coli, are so strict that they're driving up prices and creating shortages. Nevertheless, the government recently declined to relax them.</p>
        <p>GET IT WHILE YOU CAN  Brenda Padilla, child nutrition director for the Vacaville, Calif., unified school district, says she has only 3,800 pounds of beef on hand, barely enough for three days' worth of crunchy beef taco patties. ''I'm calling my distributor and saying, 'Where's the beef?' Here I am trying to plan my October menu, and I have none of the stuff coming in.'' The Chicago school system is down to 72,000 pounds. Plans are under way to purchase commercial beef. Lacrosse, Wis., is using 10,500 pounds of frozen ground beef from last year and hoping the government at least sends cheese or peanut butter.</p>

        <p>GET IT WHILE YOU CAN  Brenda Padilla, child nutrition director for the Vacaville, Calif., unified school district, says she has only 3,800 pounds of beef on hand, barely enough for three days' worth of crunchy beef taco patties. ''I'm calling my distributor and saying, 'Where's the beef?' Here I am trying to plan my October menu, and I have none of the stuff coming in.'' The Chicago school system is down to 72,000 pounds. Plans are under way to purchase commercial beef. Lacrosse, Wis., is using 10,500 pounds of frozen ground beef from last year and hoping the government at least sends cheese or peanut butter.</p>
        <p>WHAT'S COOKING?  According to the American School Food Service Association, students' true favorite is not beef but pizza. They like spicy. They love crunchy. They clamor for Mexican and Chinese. Accordingly, New York City schools now provide Jamaican patties, teriyaki chicken, plantains and chicken eggrolls. Meals that can be dipped or held in one hand are popular countrywide. ''We've done a lot of work with the pocket,'' says Barbara Gulotta, director of food technology for New York City's Board of Education. ''We have taco pockets, egg-and-cheese pockets, a pizza pocket with the toppings inside the dough.'' In Lacrosse this fall the hot item is the ''cheese dunker'': French bread rubbed with garlic, topped with mozzarella cheese, baked and served with marinara sauce. In Greenwich, it's ''chicken fryz'': nuggets shaped like French fries.</p>
        <p>AND IT'S GOOD FOR YOU, TOO  Culinary experiments can go only so far, though, now that schools are required to meet federal dietary guidelines: lower fat content, more protein, iron, calcium and vitamins A and C. Hence, districts are increasingly mixing turkey with beef for spaghetti sauce or mixing spinach and romaine in with the iceberg lettuce. The kids in the Vacaville district have a new ''garden choices food bar'' featuring sweet-potato sticks, ''carrot teenies'' and even jicama. In New York, where dietary guidelines are stricter than the federal government's, fruit cups can no longer contain viscous, sugary syrup. (Jell-O got the boot, too, because of its artificial flavors and colorings.) Tougher standards haven't stopped a new red condiment from ascending to the ranks of vegetable-hood, though. Salsa now counts as a serving of vegetables if it includes at least one-eighth of a cup of veggies or fruit. Andy Solomon, the Agriculture Department's press secretary, says that this is a far cry from ketchup-as-vegetable. ''Ketchup is mostly sugar and water,'' he notes. ''But with fresh salsa, you're basically eating a tomato.''</p>
