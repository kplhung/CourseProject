        <p>EVERYBODY, smile. Hey, no funny faces, O.K.?'' The weary-looking dad raised a camera and struggled to get his shot: three squirmy grade schoolers in the foreground, the White House in the background.</p>
        <p>The shutter clicked, but too late -- faces, alas, had been made. The family moved on, and another group replaced them, and then another, in Washington's hottest photo-op location.</p>
        <p>Watching the parade of picture takers at the south gates of the White House, I remembered my own childhood summer vacations, the ones where Dad would suddenly be inspired one morning and say, ''Get into the Oldsmobile, we're going to visit the president.'' (Actually, we were going to visit my aunt and uncle.) Soon we'd be off on a long, hot drive down the New Jersey Turnpike that ended when we drove a ceremonial pass by the Lincoln Memorial in a steamy, soupy city that had only recently learned about central air (this was the 1960's). From a 7-year-old's perspective, Washington, with its Southern languor and immense, angled boulevards flanked by walls of white stone buildings and palacelike monuments,  could seem as exotic as Bangkok.</p>
        <p>But that was before I went to Bangkok. A few decades on, Washington, my exotic summer escape from New Jersey, had repositioned itself in my traveler's imagination as a city a New Yorker is occasionally required to visit on business.</p>
        <p>However, I had been hearing from transplanted friends that Washington was in the midst of a boom fueled, in part, by the dot-com businesses now established in the area. The influx of new professionals who preferred to live in urban Washington, rather than in the suburban belts, was transforming whole sections of the city. There were interesting new restaurants, places to stay, neighborhoods to explore. When I found myself with three days to spare in the middle of an unusually cool August, I decided to revisit the president.</p>
        <p>He was not at home. In August, the city's major employer, the federal government, shuts down for vacation. It's a bad time to try to lobby your congressman, but a terrific time to snag a deal on a hotel room. Or two. Using the method that has become my default mode for finding a reasonable hotel rate in a United States city, I checked several online booking services: Travelscape, Hotel Discount Network and Quikbook. There weren't any super-cheap deals for hotels in central Washington; there were, however, bargains to be had in hotels that would normally fall outside my budget range. At the Hotel George, a new four-star hotel near Capitol Hill where the rack rate is over $200, I reserved a single room through Quikbook for $129 for one night.</p>
        <p>For my other two nights, I looked for something cheaper than what the Internet services offered. A New York friend who recently returned from a job stint in Washington told me about the Tabard Inn, a bed-and-breakfast near Dupont Circle that's been a Washington institution since the 1970's. I took a look at its Web site and liked what I saw -- idiosyncratic, one-of-a-kind rooms in three old houses that had been restored and interconnected. I called and found out I could have a room, with shared bath, for $75 a night.</p>
        <p>Since the government had gone fishing, and I'd had a full dose of Monumental D.C. on those family field trips, my travel agenda was easy to edit. I planned a three-pronged approach: Museum D.C., International D.C. and Neighborhood D.C. Basically, I wanted to spend my days enjoying Washington's  free museums until my feet, my brain or both gave out, eat exotic and cheap ethnic meals, then collapse in my cozy room on a quiet, leafy residential street.</p>
        <p>Arriving at the Tabard Inn, I knew I had found the right home base. It is tucked on a quiet block behind busy M Street, about a five-minute stroll from the Dupont Circle Metro station.</p>
        <p>To get to my room, I passed through an eccentric series of Victorian parlors, then up a narrow servant's staircase. I'd been warned that the $75 room was tiny, and it was -- but it was quite acceptable: cheerful and cute, with bright yellow walls, a stuffed easy chair and an antique brass bed with a firm, comfy mattress. I scoped out the bathroom situation and found two closet-sized ones with shower and toilet right outside my door. And there was only one other room in the little cul-de-sac on my floor. Terrific! I would have my own personal bathroom, and the guest next door could have the other.</p>
        <p>Sooner or later a budget traveler must come to grips with bathroom issues, since there is often a considerable savings to be had by booking a room with a lavatory and shower that is not, to use the elegant European description, en suite. Although by now I've survived a number of non-en-suite rooms, I never really confronted my deepest feelings about them until the following morning at the Tabard, when I discovered that the two little bathrooms next door were not only being shared by my neighbor and myself, but also by the three other rooms at the far end of the hall. And that all of these strangers had taken their showers while I was still asleep.</p>
        <p>Now, I can deal with both a toilet and a shower down the hall if that shower is utterly new and pristine, or in use only by me. But when that shower is older, a shade less than antiseptic, with evidence of recent use (as in hair in the drain), and when I have forgotten to pack my rubber flip flops -- my inner yuck-o-meter jumps into the red.</p>
        <p>I dressed quickly and went down to the reservations desk, where the clerk cheerfully moved me to a $99 room with a private bathroom.</p>
        <p>This room was considerably larger than the first, and done in a cool federal blue, with a mahogany four-poster double bed and a tall secretary in one corner. I threw my bag in the closet, undressed and had a comforting, private $24 shower. The Tabard Inn is well located, from a budget tourist point of view. A 20-minute walk uphill along 18th Street puts you in the Adams-Morgan section, ground zero for cheap ethnic eats.</p>
        <p>THE evening of my arrival I set out intending to end up in one of the Ethiopian restaurants at the top of the hill. Instead, fatigue and the aroma of sizzling chicken fajitas drew me into the first big restaurant along my path, Lauriol Plaza, an inexpensive but busy Mexican joint. Those fajitas hit the spot, and so did the shot of tequila.</p>
        <p>Before attacking the vast Smithsonian museum complex my first morning, I stopped off at the Phillips Collection, a small, private gallery housed in a historic mansion just 10 minutes' walk from the Tabard. Later, I was glad I did, for the Phillips's exhibit of Ben Shahn's black-and-white photographs, mainly candid photos of working people in New York City, turned out to be a high point of my museum blitz -- and a perfect counterpoint to the Walker Evans show I'd seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art this year.</p>
        <p>After the Phillips, I tackled the Smithsonian. I had forgotten how overwhelming it can be. It is our country's own U-Store-It Warehouse, filled to the brim with items ranging from the trivial to the priceless.</p>
        <p>I started by hitting the information desk, where there are now computerized stations that have interactive menus with schedules, maps and the like. I found out that on this day I might choose to visit, among other things, an exhibition on the history of the use of bar codes in the United States, a display of African-American choir robes and a collection on the history of the piano. I decided to skip the bar codes, but found the others, and in doing so, wandered across some other interesting exhibits I'd missed on the computer.</p>
        <p>Poking through our nation's attic is completely free. When the tourist flow is light, as it was during my visit, it is enormous fun. However, I eventually hit overload and retired to the comforting modernism of the statues and greenery in the Smithsonian's Hirschorn sculpture garden.</p>
        <p>Revived, I headed for one more attraction, the National Archives. I went to see another photographic exhibit, an excellent one, ''Picturing the Century.'' To my surprise, for the first time all day, I had to pass through an X-ray security check to enter the building. I'd forgotten that the archives' main draw is the original copies of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Viewing the documents is quite a ceremony. One ascends a slight, curving platform, where the papers are displayed under special glass and illuminated by an eerie kryptonitelike green light. People move along the ramp, passing their hands over the relics, like pilgrims at a cathedral.</p>
        <p>Museums make me hungry. Knowing this, I planned my tour so that my last stop, the archives, was only a few blocks south of a popular tapas bar called Jaleo. I'd been warned it could be a mob scene, but at 5:30 on a Thursday I had no problem getting a seat at the copper bar, a glass of Galician vino Albarino, and some tapas of manchego cheese and other delicacies that were so good I decided to make a dinner out of them.</p>
        <p>I was sorry to be leaving the Dupont Circle area. A friend of mine who works in Washington had come to meet me one afternoon, introducing me to two terrific bookstores in the neighborhood (Second Story Books at 20th and P Streets and Kramerbooks on Connecticut Avenue), and to Teaism, a two-tiered Asian style teahouse that serves Japanese snacks in lacquered bento boxes (a plate of salmon teriyaki and rice balls is about $8). But once I checked into my cool, white-and-beige modernist room at the Hotel George, with its glistening, marble-tiled bathroom, regrets evaporated. I don't get to stay in luxury hotels very often on a frugal budget.</p>
        <p>On Saturday morning I went to the hotel's fitness center -- tiny, only one treadmill, two stairclimbers and a couple of bikes, but with a steam room -- then walked 10 minutes to the Capitol, deserted except for some joggers. Another five minutes took me to Pennsylvania Avenue Southeast, the main strip of the burgeoning Capitol Hill neighborhood, with its restored Victorian brownstones, tree-lined streets and expensive coffee bars. Nearby is historic Eastern Market, where the city vanishes and is replaced by an oasis of farmers, produce, handicrafts and country lunch counters that sell things like thick steaming stacks of blueberry pancakes on paper plates.</p>
        <p>Tempting, but I had a mission. Museum Washington and Neighborhood Washington I'd covered, but the closest I'd been to International Washington was when a handsome diplomat in a sports utility vehicle waved at me as he pulled out of the Moroccan Embassy.</p>
        <p>And I had an address of a tiny restaurant in Falls Church, Va., a few miles beyond the Potomac, that I had heard served the cuisine of Laos, which I loved when I visited that country last year and haven't been able to find in New York.</p>
        <p>Washington has become a city of new immigrants, and the Virginia suburbs are home to a huge community of Southeast Asians. It took me about 20 minutes to get to Falls Church on the Metro, and another 10 to arrive, by taxi ($5) at a restaurant that, to my dismay, had been renamed Bangkok Steak House.</p>
        <p>Inside, the walls were hung, inexplicably, with huge posters of B. B. King and Chuck Berry. Over the speakers I heard an electric guitar wailing. I looked at the menu and my heart sank -- standard-issue Thai fare. But then I asked the waitress about Lao food, and she smiled.</p>
        <p>In a little while I was happily dining on balls of Lao sticky rice and fiery-hot minced meat, listening to B. B. King sing the blues. In that moment, Washington seemed as exotic to me as anyplace.</p>
        <p>Ways and means in the nation's capital</p>
        <p>I spent $150 a day for food, lodging, activities and local transportation during my three-day trip last month to Washington.</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>Traveling between New York and Washington, I compared Amtrak's Metroliner ($108 off peak, using a 10 percent AAA discount) with its new Acela Regional train ($60.50 with the discount). The Metroliner took just over three hours, the Acela 25 minutes longer. The Metroliner had a slightly smoother ride and more legroom. Both had little electrical outlets beside my seat where I could plug in my computer.</p>
        <p>In essence, Metroliner riders pay about $50 more in each direction for a little more legroom and 25 minutes.</p>
        <p>Getting Around</p>
        <p>Washington's Metro is the most convenient way to get around, and it reaches well out into the suburbs (www.wmata.com for the Metro's Ride Guide). Fares go by zones, but most in-city trips cost $1.10. You can buy an ''unlimited'' day pass for $5, but watch the clock if you do, for it cannot be used before 9:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>Lodging</p>
        <p>The Tabard Inn, 1739 N St. NW, (202) 785-1277, www.tabardinn.com, is a quirky bed-and-breakfast-style hotel where the 40 rooms are painted in bold colors and appointed with vintage furniture, mostly Victorian. Prices range from $72 for a small single without bath to $185 for a suite. I stayed one night in one of the $75 rooms, and one night in one of the lower-end rooms with bath (mine cost $99). A Continental breakfast, served in the downstairs restaurant, is included.</p>
        <p>I got a sweet deal on a room at the 139-room Hotel George. 15 E St. NW, (202) 347-4200), for $129 through the online booking service Quikbook, at www.quikbook.com. The George's single-room rates range from $225 to $265.</p>
        <p>Restaurants</p>
        <p>Jaleo, 480 Seventh St. NW, (202) 628-7949, is a spacious, stylish tapas bar within walking distance of the Mall; two tapas plates and a glass of good Galician white wine came to about $20.</p>
        <p>Among the plethora of cheap-but-good ethnic eateries in Adams-Morgan, Lauriol Plaza, 1835 18th St. NW, (202) 387-0035, is a cut above your average local Mexican restaurant; my dinner of mesquite roasted chicken fajitas with tequila came to around $20 and change.</p>
        <p>Teaism, at 2009 R St. NW near Dupont Circle, (202) 667-3827, is a good place for a restorative cup of tea in a setting of celadon teapots and wooden tables and gift shelves. A lunchtime bento box of salmon teriyaki and rice balls, with fresh lemonade, cost about $10.</p>
        <p>The Bangkok Steak House, 926 West Broad Street, Falls Church, Va., (703) 534-0095, a curious place that shares a building with an Afghan restaurant. Although the menu doesn't list any Lao dishes, the waitress will point out which of the ''Thai'' dishes are actually Lao. My meal of sticky rice, spring rolls, and larb (a heavily spiced Lao minced meat) came to $10.95)</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>The Smithsonian, with 14 museums in Washington, is the largest museum and research complex in the world; admission to all facilities is free. The hours are from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and some are extended between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Start at the visitors center (the Smithsonian Castle), 1000 Jefferson Drive SW, (202) 357-2700, to gather information on current exhibits.</p>
        <p>The Phillips Collection, 1600 21st St. NW, (202) 387-2151, is the country's first museum of modern art, housed in a beautiful late 19th-century mansion. Open Tuesday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursday 5 to 8:30 p.m., Sunday noon to 5. Admission is $7.50 on weekends, by donation on weekdays.</p>
        <p>At the National Archives, Constitution Avenue between Ninth and Seventh Streets, (202) 501-5000, the photography exhibit ''Picturing the Century'' remains up through next July 4. Open 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily; admission is free.</p>
