        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Confronting the High Cost of Divorce'' (Sept. 10) noted that when breakups are litigated, wives might need private investigators to track down assets concealed by husbands. Fees incurred can aggregate many thousands of dollars. I recall a dispute in which the tab ran to $15,000 for tailing a husband to a safe deposit box that he had leased in someone else's name and used to hold nearly half a million in currency. That proved to be money well spent; discovery of the concealed funds prompted the husband to agree to an acceptable settlement, rather than risk court testimony that would have interested the I.R.S.</p>

        <p>''Confronting the High Cost of Divorce'' (Sept. 10) noted that when breakups are litigated, wives might need private investigators to track down assets concealed by husbands. Fees incurred can aggregate many thousands of dollars. I recall a dispute in which the tab ran to $15,000 for tailing a husband to a safe deposit box that he had leased in someone else's name and used to hold nearly half a million in currency. That proved to be money well spent; discovery of the concealed funds prompted the husband to agree to an acceptable settlement, rather than risk court testimony that would have interested the I.R.S.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there is a no-  or low-cost source of information for wives going through litigated divorces: their jointly filed tax returns.</p>
        <p>A typical scenario is a client's disclosure that she foolishly signed a blank 1040 when tax time rolled around each April. Securing copies is one chore that a wife can readily handle without help from an attorney or anyone else. If the couple paid someone to complete their returns, the easiest way to get copies is to contact the preparer.</p>
        <p>And what if there was no preparer or the returns cannot be obtained from that person? The wife should ask the I.R.S. for copies. She is entitled to them even if all the jointly reported income was her husband's.  JULIAN BLOCK  Larchmont</p>
