        <p>Virginia Wood Cornish, an assistant professor, and Donald Terrence Rollock, an assistant district attorney, were married yesterday by the Rev. Robert C. Wright, an Episcopal priest, at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New York.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cornish, 30, is keeping her name. She teaches in the chemistry department at Columbia University, from which she received her bachelor's degree. She received a doctorate in chemistry from the University of California at Berkeley and was a National Science Foundation fellow in biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>She is a daughter of Martha and H. L. Cornish Jr. of Atlanta. Her father, who is retired, was the chief financial officer of the Carson Products Company, which makes personal grooming products developed for African-Americans, in Savannah, Ga. Her mother, also retired, taught English at the A. E. Beach High School in Savannah.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rollock, 31, works for the Office of the Nassau County District Attorney in Hempstead, N.Y. He graduated from the State University at Stony Brook, N.Y., and Northeastern Law School. His mother, Maria Rollock of Brentwood, N.Y., is a social worker for the Suffolk County Department of Social Services in Hauppauge, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The couple met in February 1998 at a Latin dance club in Cambridge, Mass., called Ryles Jazz Club, where Mr. Rollock asked Ms. Cornish if she wanted to dance. ''My first impression was that he thought he was a good dancer,'' she remembered. ''Not really. But he was a very good talker.''</p>
