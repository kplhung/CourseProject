        <p>I AM at the wheel of the freshly redesigned 2001 Mitsubishi Montero, doing what most people never do in off-road-capable sport utility vehicles: I am driving it off road.</p>
        <p>More precisely, I am on Old Fall River Road in Rocky Mountain National Park. The nine-mile gravel path zigzags up a narrow mountain valley to a treeless tundra with heartstopping views.</p>
        <p>There are no guardrails, and the turns are so tight that vehicles longer than 25 feet should stay back at camp. But the Montero, at just under 16 feet, maneuvers nicely, and its rack-and-pinion steering -- rare for a mountain goat like this -- as well as its unusual transmission are making pretty easy work of the terrain even at power-sapping altitudes of 8,500 to nearly 12,000 feet. With the sunroof peeled back, the pines and aspens within reach, this is truly a ride on the edge of the wilderness.</p>
        <p>Of course, the Montero is not truly about off-road treks in the highlands. While Mitsubishi likes to advertise its dirt-digging prowess, the latest Montero, full of leather and luxury, has been designed more for the Hamptons than for the Himalayas. Like just about every vehicle in this $32,000-to-$36,000 segment, the ride has been re-engineered to feel more like a car's than a camel's. The appointments are more luxurious and the third row of seats, which is standard, does a neat, four-step disappearing act into the cargo floor.</p>
        <p>Outside, the Montero's famously boxy look has been given a little flair. The front fenders have new humps, and the rear flanks have been puffed out to form beefier haunches.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, it is not a handsome wrap. The large grille and squared-off side windows don't mesh well with rounded fenders that look like cartoonish afterthoughts. A young boy stepped forward during my test drive and asked the name of the red truck. ''Montero?'' he said, mangling the pronunciation. ''Kind of ugly, especially right here,'' he said, jabbing at one of the humps.</p>
        <p>Looks may not be the only aspect to give a buyer pause. Mitsubishi confessed this summer to concealing complaints and defects about its vehicles in Japan going back more than 20 years. While I encountered no troubles with this test truck -- and none of the defects in Japan are related to Monteros sold in this country -- Mitsubishi cars and trucks have received mixed reviews in product-quality surveys. DaimlerChrysler has invested in the company and installed its own operating chief to improve Mitsubishi's fortunes.</p>
        <p>Humps aside, the Montero stands out in two other respects, which partly explain its strong sales since it was introduced in March. One is its disappearing third seat. The other is its new Sportronic automatic, a transmission that allows drivers to shift manually, but without a clutch, through five speeds in both rear-drive or three distinct four-wheel-drive modes, including a full-time all-wheel-drive setting. Up and especially down the mountain roads of north central Colorado, this was a brake-saving delight. It also provided much better coordination between the gearbox and the engine because the transmission, on its own, shifted often as it hunted for the appropriate gear in the mountains.</p>
        <p>Sportronic is standard on the Montero Limited, which starts at $35,517. A less expensive XLS, without leather and the fancy gearbox, starts at around $32,000.</p>
        <p>Third-row seats are a popular S.U.V. feature, especially for customers who want the room and flexibility of a minivan, but don't want to be seen driving one. The Montero's extra seat is a big improvement over the jump seats the truck used to have, which folded to the side when you needed them out of the way.</p>
        <p>Among the big S.U.V.'s, the Dodge Durango has a nicely designed third seat. G.M. put an even better one in its slightly larger Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon, and Ford plans one for its 2002 Explorer, due out next year. Even the next generation of the smaller GMC Envoy and Chevy Blazer will come in stretched versions with third seats. In mid-November, Toyota will begin selling its Sequoia, which also has a third row.</p>
        <p>The standard Montero third-row seat is a narrow bench that barely holds two children and has precious little legroom. There are two shoulder straps with the seat belts, and the side windows pop out for ventilation. With the seat up, I was able to stow a backpack and a few carry-ons behind it. There was also extra space below the floor. Best of all, there was room for each of my two children to have a row of his or her own. In all, there was seating for seven.</p>
        <p>When I needed to pack up for the ride home, it was easy to fold the seat and flop it into a compartment below the floor. That opened up plenty of room for about 10 bags, including two big suitcases and a set of golf clubs.</p>
        <p>Besides the tight space, the air-conditioning didn't quite reach the far-back seat. Separate automatic climate control, rear air controls and a second blower are a $900 option.</p>
        <p>On the road, the Montero was pretty well behaved, and road and wind noise were modest for a truck. It navigated hairpin turns at 40 m.p.h. with composure. The four-wheel antilock disc brakes were sure.</p>
        <p>Most trucks at this price have V-8 engines under the hood, and while the Montero's 3.5-liter, 200-horsepower V-6 will not win any prizes for brute force, it felt surprisingly strong on the highway and on city streets. Although the engine has been improved to provide better pickup at lower speeds -- peak torque is 235 foot-pounds at 3,000 r.p.m. -- it was both puzzling and humiliating to be overtaken by a Dodge minivan as we galloped up a mountain pass. The Montero was cranking out 5,000 r.p.m.,  but the minivan beat us to the top. The Montero's V-6 generally limits towing capability to 1,500 pounds, compared with around 6,000 pounds for a Ford Explorer or Expedition.</p>
        <p>While the Montero had plenty of smart touches, it also had its quirks. The side mirrors are rectangles mounted vertically instead of horizontally, the more common practice. The idea is that it will pass more easily through tight spaces, but it also narrows the view to the rear and makes blind spots larger.</p>
        <p>Also, the rear tailgate opens wide like a refrigerator door, not up like a liftgate. This is fine in the wide-open West and made loading very easy. But imagine trying to open the back end in a tight space in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Finally, there were some details that were strangely missing from a vehicle that wanted to offer every luxury and up-to-date touch. While there were dual air bags in the dash and side bags in the front seats, there was no shoulder strap or headrest for the center spot in the second row.</p>
        <p>The Montero Limited has mirrors in the sun visors, but they are not lighted, despite the vehicle's luxury pretensions. The rear side windows do not open fully and the front pasenger seat is not available with power adjustments. And one other flaw: The only indicator of whether the air-conditioning is cranking is an impossibly tiny light on the blower knob that is difficult to see on a bright day.</p>
        <p>Such details may not mean a lot to other drivers. But with the most luxurious leather version topping $36,000, the Montero shouldn't be missing much.</p>
        <p>INSIDE TRACK: Once you get over the humps, the driving is pleasant -- and the mountains are glorious.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 1, 2000, Sunday  An automobile review of the Mi tsubishi Montero last Sunday misstated the vehicle's towing capacity. It is 5,000 pounds, not 1,500.</p>
