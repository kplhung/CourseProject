        <p>ONCE, the Elijah Hubbell building was a focal point of downtown Bridgeport. With a hotel on the top floors and businesses on the first floor, the building (which dates from 1871) was abuzz with activity for years while Bridgeport thrived in the industrial era.</p>
        <p>Now, the big brick building is vacant, its windows boarded up, its copper cornice stained from years of neglect. And it is surrounded by similar buildings in similar condition in the heart of downtown. Now, too, in an effort to remake the center of the city and ease court overcrowding, officials have come up with a plan to build a court complex on a 20-acre site. The plan calls for a state juvenile court and detention center, a criminal court building, a parking garage and retail development. The entire project is expected to cost more than $100 million, with the state paying most of the bill.</p>
        <p>''We've had plans for the downtown coming out of every entrance and exit of City Hall for the past 30 years, and nothing has happened,'' the City Council president, John Fabrizi, said. ''Now we have a chance to make things happen, and solve the problems of the court overcrowding.''</p>
        <p>In all, 48 buildings on the north side of downtown will be razed to make way for the project, and it is that destruction that is causing second thoughts. Because in those 20 acres, an area that is on the National Register of Historic Places, are buildings like the Elijah Hubbell, and preservationists are asking the city to slow down.</p>
        <p>''The city's in danger of losing its soul,'' the city's historian, Charles Brilvitch, said. ''Taking out the better part of downtown for this ill-conceived idea will be the death knell for downtown.''</p>
        <p>Opponents see the overall plan, called the Congress Plaza Renewal Project, as inappropriate and unnecessary, one that will further destroy Bridgeport's heritage, force out small businesses and bring in an institution (the detention center) that will hurt the downtown's image, at a time when perception of the city was beginning to improve.</p>
        <p>A group called the Downtown Preservation Task Force has been organized to fight the plan. A letter-writing campaign has begun, petitions are being circulated, and a Web site set up. Opponents are asking the City Council for a nine-month moratorium on the project and asking state officials to stop support for the project.</p>
        <p>Charlie Shanner and Judith Miller, members of the task force who want to stop the project, said the Elijah Hubbell building is far from an empty old hulk. To them, the building is a treasure that must be saved. They believe the structure -- along with several other downtown buildings -- could be renovated and help revitalize the center of the city.</p>
        <p>''I see the potential for offices and apartments here,'' said Ms. Miller as she stood at the corner of Golden Hill Street and Main Street. ''You could have shops all along the first floor that would be part of a beautiful streetscape.''</p>
        <p>''And apartments on the top floor would get a magnificent view,'' Mr. Shanner said. ''Buildings like these are marvelous because you can go into them and pretty much make them anything you want, and still keep the historic character.'' The mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, the economic development director, Michael Freimuth, and other municipal leaders like Mr. Fabrizi, the City Council president, see the picture very differently. The downtown has been declining for years, they said, and the project presents an opportunity to build something new finally. It is simply not economically feasible, they said, to preserve the old buildings and make them useful.</p>
        <p>City officials say the construction of the new judicial buildings, together with the parking garage, accomplishes several objectives: The criminal court building will modernize and streamline Superior Court operations, now handled by two older courthouses nearby. The new structure also will make over the two-block area of Main Street and Middle Street just south of Congress Street, where there are buildings that are empty and decaying. The juvenile detention center and court will solve the overcrowding at an existing institution on the West Side of Bridgeport,  a problem the city was under court order to correct.</p>
        <p>In the area south of the planned new court buildings, Mr. Freimuth said, some dilapidated buildings will be cleared for new retail development -- although no developers have made commitments.</p>
        <p>Some demolition of 19th-century brick buildings has already taken place on the northern end of the redevelopment tract. In June, a building on Gold Street was removed because bricks were falling, said Patrick Coyne, the director of the city's Clean and Green Program, which is handling the demolitions. In July, officials said the roof collapsed on a building on Middle Street and that, too, was taken down for safety reasons. In the process of demolishing the building, the wrecking equipment damaged a nearby building. That structure was immediately declared a safety hazard, and Mayor Ganim issued an emergency demolition order.</p>
        <p>Except for emergency demolition, a municipality that wants to tear down a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places to make way for a state or federally funded construction project must submit their plans for review before the State Historical Commission. The director of the state commission, John Shannahan, said local officials must prove there is no alternative site for the planned project or show that existing buildings couldn't work.</p>
        <p>City representatives in June appeared before the panel to make their case. They presented arguments made in a consultant's report that the area was severely blighted and that renovation of the existing buildings was not financially viable.</p>
        <p>Commission officials decided they needed to do their own check of the condition of the buildings, and the city agreed to hold off on any nonemergency demolitions for a three-month period, until Oct. 6.</p>
        <p>Preservationists dispute that all of the buildings are derelict. One building slated for demolition that aroused concern is the Bridgeport Boys Club, at 227-41 Middle Street. The turn-of-the-century building is constructed of heavy masonry and brick, with the steps up to the top floors constructed with cut stone. The former owner of the building, Marshall Lewis, whose family has a business next door and owned the building for years, said the roof is in solid shape.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shanner, in fact, had inquired about buying the building at one point to move in his graphic design business and rent out store and restaurant space. But he was told by city officials that the building was going to be demolished.</p>
        <p>''That building could withstand a nuclear attack,'' said the preservation task-force member Judith Miller. Cleaning up the brick and cornices on the exterior, and renovating the interior, Ms. Miller said, would make it an exemplary building.</p>
        <p>Several people who want to save the old buildings said the city should be following the model of South Norwalk and the area of Washington Street, which has a line of historic buildings that have been converted into offices, bookstores, craft shops, restaurants and pubs. The area is one of the most popular night spots in southern Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''Twenty years ago, the buildings on Washington Street were dilapidated and decaying, too,'' Mr. Brilvitch said. ''And look what they did.''</p>
        <p>State Representative Robert T. Keeley Jr., a Democrat of Bridgeport and a preservation task-force member, also complained that the idea of bringing a juvenile court and detention center into the downtown area runs counter to the city's attempt to lure more people downtown for entertainment. ''I don't know of any other cities that are putting detention facilities in their downtowns,'' he said. ''It's not usual to use this as a marketing tool,'' he said sarcastically.</p>
        <p>Mr. Keeley and others said there are other places in the city where the juvenile detention center could be built. ''I'm going to be talking to the governor's office and let them know there is no planning down here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Freimuth said the city looked for other locations for the juvenile center. Some two dozen sites were considered and rejected -- for zoning problems, resistance from property owners, or noncompliance with state guidelines for being accessible to other judicial centers and a transportation network.</p>
        <p>''We have to balance the historic with economics,'' Mr. Freimuth said. ''We have to balance the fact that these buildings just cannot produce and perform today.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Freimuth also denied that the city had no interest in historic renovation -- citing the restoration work on the old McLevy Hall, conversion of an old bank into the Polka Dot Playhouse, the planned renovation of Read's Department store into artists' studios, and restoration of the Arcade Building. All those buildings are south of the Congress Plaza area, and a few blocks north of the city's sports development area, which includes the Bluefish baseball stadium and new sports arena.</p>
        <p>Several small-business owners in the area targeted for demolition are also bitter about the city's plan.</p>
        <p>One of those is the Aquarion Beauty Salon at 1218 Main Street, owned by Dionne Wilson. She said she's been told she has to move by October. ''I don't know if I can find a place,'' she said. ''The city hasn't given much help in finding another place. Rents are much higher in other places, or there are no vacancies. Also, you don't know if there will be enough parking,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Lance Lewis, owner of one of Bridgeport's oldest businesses, Davidson's Fabrics, at 1240 Main Street, said he does not want to leave. He said the store has been there for more than 50 years, caters to many people of modest means, and has employees who have worked with them for years.</p>
        <p>''We saw this area deteriorate for 30 years and we stuck it out. We held on,'' he said. ''Now there's a plan to make it come back, and I have to leave.''</p>
