        <p>JAMES KENNY, 58, and Linda Pugliese, 54, had just gotten married at the Church of SS. Peter and Paul in Mount Vernon. Now they were at their reception at Juliano's restaurant here, seated at a table for two decorated with white lace and a centerpiece of huge golden sunflowers and two little Champagne glasses.</p>
        <p>One of several reporters covering the event asked them how their relationship unfolded. The new Mrs. Kenny, who is legally blind, inclined her face toward her husband and said, ''I remember always wanting someone to love me and be with me, right, honey?''</p>
        <p>The reporter then asked Mr. Kenny, who has a serious heart condition, what he had been thinking about before proposing. ''I was thinking that I wanted someone nice to spend the rest of my life with,'' he replied in a tone of voice indicating that perhaps this question was rather silly, with a rather obvious answer.</p>
        <p>Mr. and Mrs. Kenny are mildly retarded. In addition to their physical disabilities, they have cognitive problems. They have known each other for six years and in that time they seem to have discovered the kind of caring and respect for each other that many people spend the better part of a lifetime seeking.</p>
        <p>The two met at a workshop run by the Westchester Association for Retarded Citizens. They were doing piece work, making small objects like key chains and stuffing envelopes. He helped her put together parts she couldn't see; she made him laugh when he was feeling bored or lonely. He was living in a supervised apartment setting; she, at home with her parents. Soon he was visiting her regularly. Last December, he proposed.</p>
        <p>For now, they will stay where they are. Mr. Kenny lives in a retirement home in New Rochelle. Mrs. Kenny is still with her mother and father in Mount Vernon. But in January, they will move into a new group home on Belvedere Road here. There, they will have their own large room and private bathroom. They will have the company of four other residents, but also the privacy a married couple needs.</p>
        <p>The house will be run by Y.A.I./National Institute for People with Disabilities, a Manhattan-based agency that serves the retarded and developmentally and learning disabled. The new group home will be financed by an initiative called ''New York State Cares,'' passed by the State Legislature in 1998, which is financing 5,000 similar group homes throughout the state.</p>
        <p>Beverly Jackson, Y.A.I.'s residential coordinator, said that representatives of the organization have been meeting with the couple for a year, preparing them for life together.</p>
        <p>''One of our psychologists has worked with them to help them define what they want from marriage,'' she said, ''what level of intimacy they expect to be involved in.'' There is also counseling on practical matters like financing (both have had jobs through workshops for the retarded; Mr. Kenny has also worked at the Postal Service); housekeeping; and medical care.</p>
        <p>''From the time I met James and Linda, they were full of self-determination,'' Ms. Jackson said. ''They said to me, 'We want to be together,' and I said, 'Absolutely.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jackson added that marriage between retarded people is still relatively rare. ''We have people who date, and go out together,'' she said, ''but when it comes to actually getting married, there is often a family opposition, or the level of care that the two need is just too different.''</p>
        <p>Sonya Washington, a residential entitlement specialist for Y.A.I., has also been meeting with the Kennys. At the wedding, she said that she will be accompanying them on their honeymoon, two days and two nights at the Marriott Hotel at New Roc City here. ''I'll be in an adjoining room, to offer whatever support they need.'' Mrs. Kenny, she added, requires help with her daily routines because of her vision problems; Mr. Kenny needs assistance with his medications.</p>
        <p>Their honeymoon and living situations may differ from those of people without developmental problems, but the Kennys' wedding looked just like anyone else's.</p>
        <p>At the church, Mrs. Kenny came down the aisle in a white silk suit with a beaded collar; Mr. Kenny was wearing a tuxedo. His brother, Thomas, an artist from Manhattan, was best man; the maid of honor was Mrs. Kenny's sister, Lucille Alexander, who also planned the wedding. Msgr. Patrick Barry led the couple through the double-ring ceremony.</p>
        <p>Later, the monsignor commented on their courage, saying that to carve out a happy life from circumstances that on the surface seemed so bleak is akin to what is meant by a state of grace. ''They have found grace, and grace has found them.''</p>
        <p>Their families agree. Ms. Alexander, vice president of marketing for a bank, presided over the wedding reception party that included 75 guests, upbeat music played by a disc jockey, a prime rib dinner, a cannoli- cream-flavored wedding cake, and everywhere, lots of sunflowers.</p>
        <p>''With Linda's limited vision, they are so big and bright, she can see them,'' Ms. Alexander said.</p>
        <p>Paul Vito, disc jockey for Music Mixer, introduced the couple for the first dance, and they moved gracefully to the 1950's hit ''You Are My Special Angel.'' Ms. Alexander watched, brushed a few tears from her eyes, and said: ''Our mother has Parkinson's disease, our father has Alzheimer's; it was a huge worry to me where Linda would live eventually. Now she has Jim.''</p>
        <p>Thomas Kenny confessed to having had doubts at first but is now equally confident that things will go well.</p>
        <p>''When Jim first introduced us to Linda, a few years ago, it was a funny kind of meeting. You know, my brother has problems, Linda has problems, it's not your typical American ideal like you see on television. But then it went on to where they were talking about getting married. And it grew and grew, and here we are. It's amazing.'' He smiled. ''But then, Jimmy's always had the capacity to amaze me.''</p>
