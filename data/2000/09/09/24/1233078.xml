        <p>FOR the playwright Romulus Linney, ''A Lesson Before Dying,'' his adaptation of Ernest J. Gaines's award-winning novel, is not just about racism. Set in Louisiana in 1948, the play tells the story of a guileless young black laborer who is wrongly convicted of murdering a white liquor store owner and sentenced to the electric chair. A black school teacher answers the pleas of the young man's godmother and shows him how to die with dignity.</p>
        <p>While acknowledging that race is a catalyst in the drama, Mr. Linney says that the play, like the novel, explores more universal themes like injustice and intolerance. ''The characters behave themselves in such an absolutely truthful human way,'' he said recently. ''I can't think of anything more powerful, more devastating than this story. But it is not a polemic. It is a tragedy.''</p>

        <p>FOR the playwright Romulus Linney, ''A Lesson Before Dying,'' his adaptation of Ernest J. Gaines's award-winning novel, is not just about racism. Set in Louisiana in 1948, the play tells the story of a guileless young black laborer who is wrongly convicted of murdering a white liquor store owner and sentenced to the electric chair. A black school teacher answers the pleas of the young man's godmother and shows him how to die with dignity.</p>
        <p>While acknowledging that race is a catalyst in the drama, Mr. Linney says that the play, like the novel, explores more universal themes like injustice and intolerance. ''The characters behave themselves in such an absolutely truthful human way,'' he said recently. ''I can't think of anything more powerful, more devastating than this story. But it is not a polemic. It is a tragedy.''</p>
        <p>The play, directed by Kent Thompson, opened last week at the Peter Norton Space in Manhattan, the first production of the Signature Theater Company's 10th season. (It runs through Oct. 15.) This season the company is trying something new. In the past it has devoted each season to the work of a single playwright. This year it has invited each of nine past writers-in-residence to present a new play.</p>
        <p>Mr. Linney says he knew after reading the novel that he wanted to adapt it to the stage. ''The absolute inevitability of what happened absorbed me in the story,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaines, 67, who is black, insists that race was not a factor in his choosing Mr. Linney, 69, who is white, to make a play of the novel, which won the National Book Critics Circle award for fiction in 1993. ''I had a good idea of what he could do,'' Mr. Gaines said of Mr. Linney, whom he has known for 25 years. Both have deep Southern roots, and each has long respected the work of the other. Mr. Linney is the author of ''The Sorrow of Frederick,'' ''Holy Ghosts,'' ''Heathen Valley,'' among other plays, many of which deal with small-town life in the South. He was the Signature's writer in residence during its first season, 1991-92.</p>
        <p>Like the Gaines novel, the play unfolds through the relationship that develops between Jefferson, the young laborer (played by Jamahl Marsh) and Grant Wiggins, the teacher (Isiah Whitlock Jr.). Wiggins, who has his own woes with God, the community and teaching, is at first reluctant to come to Jefferson's aid and only does so at the urging of the godmother (Beatrice Winde).</p>
        <p>In one impassioned moment, she implores Wiggins to help. She tells him that the defense lawyer, in an attempt to save her godson's life, has reduced him to little more than an animal in the eyes of the jury. ''Look at this boy,'' she says angrily. ''What kind of justice is this? Backwoods Louisiana. Dirt Poor. Knows nothing, is nothing. Not even a human being. I would as soon put a hog in that electric chair. Because that is what we will be doing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Linney uses such stark language to capture a sense of time and place. He says that in adapting the novel he was guided by Somerset Maugham's advice on the subject: ''Stick to the point, and cut whenever you can.''</p>
        <p>JAMES HOUGHTON, the founder and artistic director of Signature, who is a native San Franciscan, appreciates Mr. Linney's ability to convey the play's Southern soul. ''Romulus has this remarkable Applachian richness and understanding of historical drama,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, the play, under Mr. Thompson's direction, had its premiere at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, which is serving as its co-producer with Signature. The play, as adapted by Ann Peacock and starring Cicely Tyson, was broadcast last year by HBO, and the show won two Emmy awards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaines says the idea for ''A Lesson Before Dying'' had ''haunted me for most of my adult life.'' He had lived in San Francisco and was aware that executions at San Quentin took place every Tuesday morning at 10. ''I felt horrible the entire night before and all day,'' he recalled.  ''You can imagine what the person being executed went through.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Houghton perhaps best sums up what ''A Lesson Before Dying'' is all about: ''It has a lot to say about many things, but you must understand what Ernest and Romulus are going after is for the audience to understand how absurd our inhumanity to one another can be.''</p>
