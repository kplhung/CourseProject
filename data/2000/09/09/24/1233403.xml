        <p>THIS is Mitt Romney's first Olympic experience, and he is having a great time, donning an official Salt Lake Organizing Committee outfit and joining the staff for a jog up the Sydney Harbor Bridge.</p>
        <p>There is time to go to events and say, what a city, what wonderful people, but by the way, there is no way Salt Lake City can match Sydney in national fervor or expenditure.</p>
        <p>''I saw the headline 'Our Finest Hour,' '' Romney said the other day. ''I doubt that any paper would say that in the States, even in Salt Lake City -- maybe for D-Day or landing on the moon.''</p>
        <p>He is enjoying these Summer Games because they are not his. He doesn't have to worry about escaping convicts or grass fires or bus snarls. All he has is a lingering scandal back home and concerns about putting on modest but uplifting Winter Games in 2002.</p>
        <p>Romney, 53, is the fresh breeze imported from back East during revelations about the inbred burghers who bought the Games. But first, he had to give himself an education.</p>
        <p>''I had no notion of who Juan Antonio Samaranch was,'' Romney said. ''I had no idea what the International Olympic Committee did. I didn't know it was located in Lausanne. I knew nothing about the United States Olympic Committee. The only thing I read on the sports pages were the results.''</p>
        <p>He walked into an organization on the eve of destruction, but Romney does not lack for confidence.</p>
        <p>''I specialize in turnarounds,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In his work for Bain &amp; Company, he was a leader among alpha males in nearly identical dark suits and blue shirts and red suspenders who worked long hours and shared a secret handshake and made tons of money. You've heard of Moonies? These guys are called Bainies. He's not exactly a naif. He saw his father, the late George W. Romney, run into a buzz saw when he ventured outside Michigan to try to run for president.</p>
        <p>''In my business, you don't want any free publicity,'' Mitt Romney said. ''Politics are the exact opposite.''</p>
        <p>He discovered that in 1994 when he ran for the Senate against a man with an even more familiar name. ''I learned a lot from Ted Kennedy,'' Romney said. ''He's the master. I used to say, 'Wow, are they good.' ''</p>
        <p>The Kennedy campaign put Romney on the defensive for his Mormon religion, his wealth, his father, his party.</p>
        <p>What else could anybody say about him if he ran a troubled Olympic committee?</p>
        <p>''My wife talked me into it,'' Romney said, referring to Ann Romney, who grew up in Birmingham, Mich., and attended Brigham Young University in Utah, just as he did.</p>
        <p>''She told me, 'You have exactly the background.' The more I thought about it, I realized, we're only here for one lifetime. I was making more money than I should have. It was time to do something different.''</p>
        <p>Observing his first Olympic Games, Romney has discovered he cannot afford what these folks are doing.</p>
        <p>''Sydney is the high-water mark in investment,'' Romney said, noting that Sydney organizers have said their budget ''was $1.5 billion, American, but I've read it was really $5.6 billion, if you add everything in. That's not something you do in the U.S. It's politically unacceptable.</p>
        <p>''Here it's national pride. For us, it's city and state. I doubt that somebody in Vermont would feel the same way about the Games, even the people who love winter sports.''</p>
        <p>He says the Salt Lake City committee has rebounded since the dreary days of February 1999.</p>
        <p>''We went a whole year without new sponsors,'' Romney said. ''The scandal sent a shudder through the country.''</p>
        <p>One tremor came when David D'Alessandro, the chief executive of John Hancock Financial Services, whom Romney respected from the opposite side of Massachusetts politics, threatened to pull out as a major sponsor.</p>
        <p>''Given the fact that John Hancock was visibly critical, it sent a signal,'' Romney said. ''David's a smart guy, a nice guy. He sent a message. But ultimately he re-upped. It was symbolically important. I think corporate America wants to be part of it.</p>
        <p>''When I started, I was like a deer in the headlights, but we hired good people, I knocked on doors, and now we've raised $770 million from U.S. marketing. We're clearly on track.''</p>
        <p>Romney concedes that damage has been done.</p>
        <p>''We have not rebuilt excitement and enthusiasm,'' he said. ''The cloudy history has many people feeling less proud of the Games in Salt Lake City. We let our country down the way we got the Games. I'll admit, when I took over, I asked, 'Should we turn back the Games?' My personal view is that the best way to make amends is to replace the scandal with great Games.''</p>
        <p>However, the Games are going to be run with a budget that cannot match Sydney's.</p>
        <p>''We're going to be like the family that says it doesn't have money at Christmas and is going to have to get back to the old spirit,'' Romney said. ''There are 8,000 banners around here costing $200 each. You multiply it, and it comes to $1.6 million. We're going to celebrate the athlete the best way we can, but we're going to cut way back.''</p>
        <p>Will his Winter Games suffer because the legal cases will still be pending during the Games?</p>
        <p>''People can distinguish between athletes and managers,'' Romney said. ''If the managers are in trouble, so be it. They will get a fair legal hearing.''</p>
        <p>There have been legal troubles in Atlanta and Sydney. The organizers in Nagano, Japan, burned their records, an option not available for Mitt Romney. But right now, Sydney is bustling, and Salt Lake City is 17 time zones and 17 months away.</p>
