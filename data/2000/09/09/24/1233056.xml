        <p>THE classic image of a dog on a road trip, head out the car window, tongue lolling in the breeze, is due for a revision.</p>
        <p>Here's the bad news for Rover. In conversations with trainers, guidebook writers and other experts on the subject of traveling with dogs, opinions were firm: it's a mistake to let a dog put its head out the window of a moving car -- flying debris can injure eyes and ears.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, experts believe that dogs should be restrained in cars to keep them from harming themselves and human passengers.</p>
        <p>Andrea Arden, director of the Manhattan Dog Training and Behavior Center, says that if a dog is not confined, ''he's likely to get you into an accident if he jumps around in the car, and he can hurt himself as well in a short stop.'' Ms. Arden, who wrote the introduction for ''On the Road With Your Pet,'' a Mobil Travel Guide published by Fodor's in 1998 and 1999, suggested a travel crate, a barrier built into the car (for larger dogs) or a harness to restrain a dog.</p>
        <p>Although there are a number of harnesses designed for cars, Ms. Arden said, travelers can use an ordinary harness connected to a leash, which is then attached to something stable in the car.</p>
        <p>''Your goal is that your dog not become like a missile,'' said Jacque Schultz, director of special projects for the A.S.P.C.A. ''And if there's an accident and your windows break, the dog cannot jump out of the car and onto the highway.''</p>
        <p>Tips for the Road</p>
        <p>Here are more suggestions for successful road trips with a dog. (Air travel is a separate and thorny issue, covered in this column on April 23.) These are based on experts' advice and my experience with my exuberant 5-year-old, 35-pound setter mix, Cindy, who has traveled happily in eight states, staying in short-term rental houses, friends' and relatives' homes and motels.</p>
        <p>Call ahead. Never take the word of a guidebook or Web site that a hotel accepts dogs. ''Ownership changes, management changes, and the place isn't pet friendly anymore,'' said Judi Stiles, president of Stiles in Travel in Sacramento. The agency, affiliated with www.traveldog.com, handles bookings for dog owners.</p>
        <p>I like to get a written or faxed confirmation from the hotel that mentions the dog specifically -- the person who takes the reservation will not necessarily be at the front desk when you arrive.</p>
        <p>Ask lots of questions. Some hotels limit pets by size, often 25 pounds; many insist that owners take dogs with them when they leave the room, which can put a crimp in a vacation.</p>
        <p>Beyond these commonplace policies, innkeepers in particular often have individual rules that work for their establishment. In my experience, this is a good sign: the proprietor has experience with pet owners and specific expectations of them, which reduces misunderstandings.</p>
        <p>''When the expectations aren't clear, there's a lot of room for problems,'' said Dawn Habgood, co-author of the guidebook series ''On the Road Again With Man's Best Friend,'' who has been researching the subject for 17 years. I myself have found that when an innkeeper is asked, ''Do you take dogs?'' the answer often is: ''If they're well behaved.'' This murky reply needs  clarification.</p>
        <p>Is there a fee? Some hotels charge pet owners. It could be a nominal $10; I've paid as much as $50 at a Residence Inn by Marriott in Richmond, Va. (which now charges $125).  In this case, guests typically spend several days or more, and the fee covers the whole stay. It's also not unusual for a hotel to charge a refundable deposit of $100 or more to cover possible damage. If you pay a deposit, you should carefully note the room's condition when you arrive and tell the management immediately if there is any prior damage.</p>
        <p>Where is the room? A first-floor room with a door that opens directly to the outside, or one next to an exit door makes nightly walks easier.</p>
        <p>Pack carefully. Carry copies of up-to-date vaccination records. Experts recommend a second ID tag with your temporary address and a photo of the dog's distinctive markings should (Heaven forbid) it get lost. Include some bedding, an extra leash, familiar toys, the dog's usual food and bowls and, if it is prone to stomach upset, water from home or bottled water. Don't forget plastic bags or other cleanup supplies.</p>
        <p>Consider the crate. Nonconverts (often people who aren't pet owners) may recoil at the idea (''You put her in a CAGE?''), but many dogs, seeking a cozy den by nature, are thoroughly at ease in them. And when properly used, a crate can increase the comfort level for pet and owner in unfamiliar settings. Ms. Schultz said that many hotels insisted dogs be crated when they were left alone in the room.</p>
        <p>Make frequent rest stops. Like children, dogs need to stretch.</p>
        <p>Don't leave the dog in a parked car unattended. Even with the windows rolled partly down, on a hot day the temperature inside a car can quickly reach dangerous levels.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the key to planning a successful outing is that ''the dog should enjoy the trip -- everything involved with the trip,'' as Ms. Arden put it. Owners should level with themselves about how dog-appropriate the destination and agenda are.</p>
        <p>''If you're going hiking in the woods, and your dog is in shape, or renting a cabin in Maine where your dog can swim, that's tremendous fun,'' Ms. Schultz of the A.S.P.C.A. said. ''But to take your dog to Disney World so they can sit in the kennels there? I think they would just as soon stay home.''</p>
        <p>Resources</p>
        <p>Sources of information include the following:</p>
        <p>''On the Road Again With Man's Best Friend,'' by Dawn and Robert Habgood, (Dawbert Press) comprises both an encyclopedic 912-page United States volume ($19.95) and more detailed regional guides. There were six regional guides, but they are being reduced to four for next spring; still $19.95. Meanwhile, three of the old guides are available: the Southwest ($15.95), New England ($17.95) and West Coast ($19.95). The national book contains 18,000 brief listings; the regional ones have lengthier profiles of the authors' favorite lodgings along with suggestions for pet-friendly parks, beaches and hiking trails nearby. Information: (800) 933-2923.</p>
        <p>''Traveling With Your Pet: The AAA Pet Book,'' in its second edition,  has more than 10,000 AAA-rated lodgings in the United States and Canada; $13.95, discounted for members at AAA clubs; (877) 222-2665.</p>
        <p>''Vacationing With Your Pet,''  $19.95, by Eileen Barish, is published by Pet-Friendly Publications of Scottsdale, Ariz. A 720-page tome in its fourth edition listing more than 25,000 pet-friendly accommodations in the United States and Canada. The author also publishes guides to Arizona, Texas, New York and California and a regional Northwest guide ($19.95 each) that list lodgings and ideas for hikes and other activities; but those books are older, ranging from 1996 to 1998. To order, call (800) 638-3637 or visit www.travelpet.com.</p>
        <p>''Pets Welcome'' is a series that includes a national edition ($19.95) and six regional editions ($15.95), with two more being added next year. Handsomely laid out and illustrated, the regional books devote a full page to each lodging so that the Mid-Atlantic and Chesapeake Region Guide, at 224 pages, contains only 104 choices. The original writers, Kathleen and Robert Fish, are no longer affiliated with the publisher, and the books will have a new editorial team as they are updated. Published by Millennium Publishing of Monterey, Calif.; (800) 524-6826.</p>
        <p>''On the Road with Your Pet'' was published by Fodor's as part of the Mobil guide series, most recently in 1999; a new publisher has no plans to reissue that specific volume, said  Sandy Duhe, program manager for the guides.</p>
        <p>Dog Gone is a newsletter published six times a year ($24 annual subscription) by Wendy Ballard of Vero Beach, Fla. It has information on lodging, places to go and activities for dogs and their owners; (561) 569-8434 or www.doggonefun.com.</p>
        <p>Here are some Internet sources:</p>
        <p>Although www.petswelcome.com is not connected to the guidebook series, it is very useful, with listings of accommodations in the United States, Canada and France (a ''very pet-friendly'' destination, the site notes) that accept dogs (with separate listings for B &amp; B's, ski resorts and lodgings near amusement parks); kennels, pet sitters and veterinarians, and a bulletin board with tips and anecdotes. Some listings have links to the lodging's Web site. Reservations can be made online.</p>
        <p>The Dawbert Press site, www. thejetsetpet.com, contains highlights from the Habgoods' series (above),  answers to pet owners' questions, and a roundup of parks by state.</p>
        <p>The www.traveldog.com site is  well designed, with extensive listings of accommodations that accept dogs (some with links to the lodging) as well as other information. There are also links to a travel agent for bookings and companies selling auto barriers and seatbelts for dogs.</p>
        <p>And www.dogfriendly.com lists lodgings, attractions and stores where dogs are allowed; Banana Republic, 59th Street and Lexington Avenue, is one.</p>
