        <p>One morning last week in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx, a clamorous, winding line of more than a dozen people waited to use the telephone inside one of the city offices set up to serve poor people with AIDS.</p>
        <p>Inside the drab, anonymous building at 260 East 161st Street between Grant and Morris Avenues, up on the seventh floor where there are no rest rooms for anyone other than the staff, the waiting felt endless, and often ridiculous.</p>
        <p>After all, the four telephones, positioned on the wall in the crowded lounge, merely allow clients to contact their caseworkers -- caseworkers seated somewhere behind the walls of the office or on another floor. And if they get the the caseworkers on the phone, they simply say they are there, waiting.</p>
        <p>This particular morning, three of the four telephones were out of order.</p>
        <p>Throughout the morning, men and women paced over to peer down the long, narrow corridor, anxious to snare a caseworker perhaps on the way to one of the staff restrooms. One some days, fistfights break out among the frustrated clients, and the police are called in. The center serves 4,500 clients.</p>
        <p>For people trying to get their food stamps back or to see if an apartment rental check has been cut, the struggle to break through the bureaucracy can produce incredible bitterness, even an awful gallows humor. If the disease doesn't kill us, the angry joke goes among some clients, then the Division of AIDS Services and Income Support will.</p>
        <p>The Kingsbridge center, one of 10 in the city, offers a snapshot into the deeply imperfect process that was outlined by a federal judge in a scathing decision last Monday. He ruled that the failures of the division had ''devastating consequences,'' and ordered the agency, an arm of the city's Human Resources Administration, to be put under federal oversight for three years.</p>
        <p>The judge, Sterling Johnson Jr. of the Federal District Court, said the agency had ''chronically and systematically'' delayed or stopped subsistence benefits, including emergency housing, rent assistance, food stamps, Medicaid and other services that it administers for about 25,000 New Yorkers who have AIDS or are H.I.V.-positive.</p>
        <p>The ruling came in response to a class-action lawsuit brought in 1995 by Housing Works Inc., a social service group for infected people, which has long sparred with the Giuliani administration over city AIDS policies -- in this instance over cutbacks to the Division of AIDS Services and Income Support.</p>
        <p>City officials called the ruling vague and said it would be appealed.</p>
        <p>But the vagaries of the system, the way in which things seems to happen for no rhyme or reason, are what people with AIDS and many front-line organizations have been complaining about all along.</p>
        <p>The city agency was set up in 1986 when New York found itself at the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic. The city sought to provide a kind of one-stop shopping for welfare benefits. No longer would frail and indigent patients have to run the gantlet of separate city welfare offices, dragging themselves to one place for public assistance, to another for Medicaid, and so on. People with AIDS would obtain all their government benefits from a single agency.</p>
        <p>Yet almost from the outset, AIDS advocates and patients say, the agency has failed to deliver basic services. And in the mid-1990's, the division fought for its very existence when the Giuliani administration considered disbanding it to help close a budget deficit. In a major restructuring, the agency's budget and staff were reduced instead.</p>
        <p>Some advocates for those with AIDS say the agency is a dysfunctional bureaucracy, unable to accommodate a growing caseload of people with AIDS, clients kept alive by new and powerful combinations of drug therapies. A Housing Works staff lawyer, Armen Merjian, said that while caseworkers had an average of 34 clients before the cutbacks, the loads soon reached 60 per caseworker at some of the division's centers.</p>
        <p>Judge Johnson's decision cited findings that in a third of its cases, the city took more than 30 days to provide emergency benefits that were required within 72 hours. Among applicants for housing in one of the division's 10 centers, the agency failed to meet its own deadlines on more than three-quarters of the cases. It failed to pay rent on new apartments in 32 percent of cases.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Human Resources Administration, Ruth Reinecke, said on Friday that the city was doing a good job of resolving problems, and that the homeless and sick were receiving housing within 24 hours. She added that benefits would have been cut off without notice only because of an occasional computer glitch. ''I'm absolutely sure that we always issue a notice when somebody's benefits are going to be cut off,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But on this day at the Kingsbridge center, a sad-eyed woman named Maria complained that she was cut off from her monthly food stamps for September, worth $335, without warning. And she was having trouble feeding her three young children.</p>
        <p>''I have to stand guard in the kitchen and say, 'Save it for tomorrow; it's the only thing we have to eat,' '' said Maria, 35. ''They are used to having cabinets full, with spaghetti and sandwiches. This month has been very hard.''</p>
        <p>The woman, whose children do not know that she has AIDS, said a caseworker gave her $37 in emergency assistance two weeks ago, and told her to return to the center this day for more emergency funds while her food stamp problems were being sorted out. But then this morning, she said, the caseworker told her inexplicably that he could not give her any financial aid.</p>
        <p>''He said to wait, but I really don't know what I'm waiting for,'' she said wearily, adding that she had lost more than 10 pounds because of the stress. ''I'm just hoping that they will do something.''</p>
        <p>Caseworkers at the center on Thursday were forbidden to be interviewed. Some walked briskly down the hallway, rustling papers, and moved in and out of closed doors.</p>
        <p>''Nobody should be in the hallway standing like this,'' one said gruffly, loudly telling people who were looking for their caseworker to get back into the lounge. There, at least two clients were accompanied by representatives of neighborhood organizations to help them navigate the labyrinthine system.</p>
        <p>''There have been times I came at 9 a.m. and have not been seen until 4:30 p.m.,'' said Magda Rivera, a social worker with Project Return, a nonprofit group that finds housing for infected people. Her client does not speak English.</p>
        <p>Joseph Capestany, who is 44 and has AIDS, knows the Kingsbridge center only too well. He spends several afternoons a week there, he said, as a volunteer for the New York City AIDS Housing Network, an advocacy group. Mr. Capestany makes his presence known and tracks problems.</p>
        <p>He calls the network's executive director, Jennifer Flynn, if clients are left without emergency housing. They fill out a complaint form and fax it to city officials and elected officials, hoping to pressure the division into finding a place that night.</p>
        <p>But even with Mr. Capestany's training as a volunteer -- he took an eight-week course on AIDS advocacy last spring -- he said the layers of bureaucracy were impenetrable even to him when he had his own problems.</p>
        <p>From late June to early August, Mr. Capestany said, he showed up at the center every single day. He tried to prod caseworkers into speeding up paperwork so that he could rent an apartment in the Bronx. He had previously lost out on two apartments, and had become homeless, when the agency had taken too long to process rental checks. Mr. Capestany said he finally got his apartment, though he said the division was currently late in paying this month's rent to his landlord.</p>
        <p>Mr. Capestany, a former heroin addict now enrolled in a methadone maintenance program, conceded that the center's staff workers had their hands full with sometimes difficult clients.</p>
        <p>''It's not that there aren't workers who aren't dedicated,'' he said. ''They will try to do what they can, but you only have a handful of them,  and there's too many people to be serviced.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 1, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about complaints by AIDS patients about poor service at the Bronx office of the Division of AIDS Services and Income Support, an agency that has been placed under federal oversight, misidentified the neighborhood where the Bronx AIDS center is located. The center, known as the Kingsbridge Office, is at 260 East 161st Street in the Concourse Village section of the Bronx. It is not in the Kingsbridge section.</p>
