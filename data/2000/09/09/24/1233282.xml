        <p>Eric Warner, the lead prosecutor at the trial of Amadou Diallo, will be leaving the Bronx district attorney's office next month to become a partner at a Midtown Manhattan law firm. Last week, a friend sardonically asked him if he was going to miss Bronx cuisine.</p>
        <p>''I told him, I know you're saying that as a joke,'' Mr. Warner said, ''but the truth is, I'm going to miss Fauzia, the cart lady.''</p>
        <p>Few people who live and work near the Bronx courthouses know Fauzia Abdur-Rahman's full name. Some call her Fauzia. Others just call her Ma.</p>
        <p>But ever since 1996, when she set up a cart on the corner of 161st Street and Sheridan Avenue, across the street from the criminal courthouse,  and began serving a mix of Jamaican specialties, Indian flat breads and Italian dishes under the sign Heavenly Delights, Ms. Abdur-Rahman has contributed far more to life on the corner than just what she dishes out in containers.</p>
        <p>Neighborhood children stop by to show her their report cards. Local residents stop by for advice. Ms. Abdur-Rahman, who calls everyone sweetie, has made so many friends here that whenever she considers moving her cart to Manhattan, where she would probably make more money, she decides against it.</p>
        <p>''After a time, I had such a good bond with the people here -- some got married or moved or changed careers, and I went through all those changes with them -- so they were like friends,'' she said. ''I couldn't leave.''</p>
        <p>When Ms. Abdur-Rahman was growing up on the island of Jamaica, her family was so well off that she never had to lift a finger around the house. But when an her aunt offered her a free trip to New York after college, she left and never returned.</p>
        <p>For a time, she worked for the city's Department of Social Services. But after she had the first of her three children, she could not make ends meet.</p>
        <p>Her mother, Ruby Richards, who now lives with her in Harlem, suggested that she go into business and taught her two specialties: sorrel, an herbal drink brewed with ginger, and codfish cakes, a deep-fried Jamaican specialty. From there, Ms. Abdur-Rahman branched out on her own. Now she is known for her lemon cakes, banana pudding and jerk chicken.</p>
        <p>Her lunch specials sell for $4 and $6 apiece, and she is sold out by 2 p.m. One recent afternoon at 2:30, a woman in a hot pink shirt peered longingly into the metal trays.</p>
        <p>''Any pumpkin left?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>Ms. Abdur-Rahman lifted the lid. ''It's the bottom of the pan,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''That's O.K.,'' the customer replied. ''That's usually the sweetest part.''</p>
