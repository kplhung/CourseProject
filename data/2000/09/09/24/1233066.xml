        <p>Patrick Sloan, Charlotte Border, Jane Klein, Houston, Aug. 18, 2000</p>
        <p>Sloan (center): ''We were at Little Woodrow's for the pre-party of Bellaire High School's 10th reunion. You go to the reunion to catch up on gossip, just like in high school. Gossip is gossip. You want to hear the dirt. A lot of girls that all the boys had crushes on in high school were all happily married. As for the boys, I definitely noticed that sense of, 'Are we at that age?' It's that old high school metaphor: once one guy asks someone to the prom, then everybody has to run out and ask. We were mad when our first friend got married. Not because of her -- we liked her -- but because he was putting pressure on all the other guys.''</p>

We were mad when our first friend got married. Not because of her -- we liked her -- but because he was putting pressure on all the other guys.''</p>
        <p>Border (second from right): ''Everything was very superficial. The people who come to reunions are not 'I'm unemployed and still living with my parents' kind of people. So you hear the same things from everybody: 'Oh, I've got a great job.' It seems like such a cookie-cutter type of thing. The smartest guy in the class -- you know what? He's a doctor. And the cheerleaders were pregnant. I think the people who did have some good scoop -- people who were divorced or had big things happen -- didn't come to the reunion and didn't get to talk about it. And nobody wanted to dance. They did play Vanilla Ice, though; that was probably one of the better moments.''</p>
        <p>Klein (right): ''Everything was different than I thought it would be. For one thing, not that many people showed up. I would have to think that the people who did come were there because they were happier, they had something to show off, they had kids or a great husband. Maybe the ones who didn't come are the ones who didn't have a whole lot to say. So I was surprised at how many of the people in school who were maybe less popular were there. There were more of those types of people there than the popular crowd. It was nice because you would talk to all of them. It wasn't like you avoided any of them.''</p>
