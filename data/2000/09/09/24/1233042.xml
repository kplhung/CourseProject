      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>When you boil down all the ersatz news commentary and talking-head punditry, what remains is Sullivan's revealing, embarrassing and downright accurate analysis of this year's campaign season. However, he ought to have mentioned Bill Clinton, who could beat either of the two pampered pretenders to the throne in a landslide.</p>
        <p>I think Sullivan's underlying point is that the Old Guard political establishment in America is determined not to let another one of the great unwashed occupy the White House this time around. And unfortunately, it's going to get its way.</p>
