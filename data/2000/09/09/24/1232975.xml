        <p>Jesse Bradford at the Chateau Marmont:  A Columbia University senior, Bradford, 21, has been acting since he was 4 years old. He doesn't consider himself much of a clotheshorse but is passionate about a vintage Hawaiian shirt given to him by the director Baz Luhrmann. ''He said it was a copy of the one Montgomery Clift wore in a screen test for 'From Here to Eternity,''' Bradford says. The actor co-stars opposite Kirsten Dunst in ''Bring It On,'' which was released last month.</p>
        <p>Jon Abrahams at the Argyle Hotel  Abrahams, 22, a TriBeCa native, co-stars with Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro in ''Meet the Parents,''which opens in October. Although photographed wearing black, in real life he limits the color to his socks. ''I prefer eclectic clothes, especially late-60's, early-70's pimp-style ones,'' he says, which are perfect with the pair of white patent-leather shoes he had custom-made to replace a favorite three-dollar pair from Goodwill.</p>

        <p>Kip Pardue at the Sunset Marquis Hotel and Villas  Pardue, 24, is a Yale University graduate and former Abercrombie &amp; Fitch model who never met a Helmut Lang jacket he didn't like and can wax poetic about the cut of Costume National's trousers. The expression ''less is more'' surely applies to the actor's footwear collection, which consists of one pair of dress shoes, one pair of tennis shoes and two pairs of flip-flops. He appears this month with Denzel Washington in ''Remember the Titans.''</p>
        <p>Santiago Douglas at L'Ermitage Beverly Hills  Douglas, 25, stars this month with Michelle Rodriguez in ''Girlfight,'' which shared the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival this year. Not only did Douglas learn to box for the role, but he also lost 20 pounds. Already fairly thin, he starved himself ''green and wobbly,'' he recalls. ''One more pound and I would have collapsed.'' Not a good thing when your most treasured garment is a see-through linen shirt.</p>
        <p>Adam Garcia at the Avalon Hotel  Garcia's first paying job was tap-dancing on the steps of Sydney's town hall. The 27-year-old Australian actor received an Olivier nomination last year for best actor in a musical for his role in the London stage production of ''Saturday Night Fever.'' His latest movie, ''Bootmen,'' comes out next month. His favorite look? A brown ''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' T-shirt, paired with a well-worn pair of blue Billabong corduroys, for a style ''only a mother could love.''</p>
        <p>Matt Davis at the Standard  Davis, 22, has two movies opening this fall: 'Urban Legends: Final Cut'' and Joel Schumacher's ''Tigerland.'' His first big break was on MTV's ''Singled Out.'' ''They asked me to name the most outrageous thing a date ever wore,'' the Salt Lake City native says. ''I lied and said that my homecoming date arrived to meet my parents wearing nothing but chaps. They asked me to be on the show right then and there.''</p>
