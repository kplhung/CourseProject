        <p>It sounded like a deal too good for retired New York State teachers to pass up: come back to the classroom and draw a full salary while continuing to receive their full pension benefits.</p>
        <p>But the offer, made 10 days ago by the Board of Regents to combat the state's teacher shortage, may not be good enough to draw some retired New York City teachers back to the classroom, judging from interviews with several of them.</p>
        <p>While the proposal offers high salaries, the difficult working conditions in the schools outweigh the financial incentives, these retired teachers said.</p>
        <p>Some teachers can retire at 55 and collect almost as much money as when they were working because of relatively generous pension packages set up for public employees after World War I to compensate for meager salaries. Their pensions were maintained even after benefit plans were replaced by cheaper alternatives during the 1970's fiscal crisis because state law says pension benefits cannot be reduced after a commitment is made.</p>
        <p>Barbara Jobo, 58, who has been retired for five years, received one of the better pension packages, which allowed her to retire early. Ms. Jobo, like other retired teachers, cited crumbling buildings, poor treatment from principals and increasingly larger classes as some of the main reasons for declining the offer. She says she is happier working as the president of the Bay Terrace Community Association, her local civic association in Bayside, Queens.</p>
        <p>''Wild horses could never bring me back,'' said Ms. Jobo, who worked at Public School 32 in District 25 in Flushing, Queens, for 34 years. ''As much money as it would bring and as much as I love teaching, I can only recall the nightmare and the struggle with the bureaucracy of the Board of Education.''</p>
        <p>Many of the retirees said they were already leading comfortable lives. Some work part-time jobs, for $10,000 or less to supplement their pension benefits, while others earn $200 a day working as mentors to young teachers.</p>
        <p>A few teachers, like Susan Cutler, 57, who retired two years ago with 21 years in the system, said they might be interested in the offer but would have to know more about it.</p>
        <p>The Board of Regents is to ask the State Legislature in January to approve the measure, and details are still being worked out. The offer was set up to draw teachers to districts that the state classifies as performing poorly or that have a high level of need, including the roughly 100 schools in danger of being closed for poor performance.</p>
        <p>In the state, more than half the current 230,000 teachers will be eligible to retire in this decade. In New York City, 54,000 positions will need to be filled over the next five years, officials say. That figure includes positions for about 14,000 teachers considering retirement in the next two years, said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weingarten, who is negotiating with City Hall for a new contract for the city's 78,000 teachers, said the Regents' measure was one of many steps that would help the teacher shortage. But she said she doubted that many of the 40,000 eligible retired teachers would return. ''It's going to be about treating people better,'' she said. ''You try to do salary increases so they don't make those decisions to retire.''</p>
        <p>Under current New York law, teachers returning to government work in the state, including as substitute teachers, can earn only $17,000 before incurring a cut in their pension benefits. Some have taken teaching jobs in Connecticut and New Jersey, raising their income without being penalized.</p>
        <p>Under the Regents' proposal, a teacher who retired at 55 after 25 years of service from a job paying $70,000 would, by returning to the classroom, continue to earn that amount plus $35,000 a year in pension benefits, bringing the annual income to more than $100,000.</p>
        <p>Robert C. Diskin, 58, of Forest Hills, Queens, retired four years ago, after 31 years. He took a buyout in 1996 because it made financial sense for him to retire, he said. He receives nothing near $100,000 with his pension benefits, he said, but the new proposal barely stirred him.</p>
        <p>''Why work?'' he asked. ''I earn just as much in retirement as I did working, and I don't have the headaches. Besides, the system had degenerated. It got harder and harder to do it. There was so much stuff that they threw at you that you spent more time filling forms and doing extraneous things that weren't teaching.''</p>
        <p>His salary was about $60,000, or $52,000 after taxes and Social Security deductions, and his annual pension has also been about $52,000.</p>
        <p>But the Regents and union leaders are relying on teachers who received pension plans that were not as large as Mr. Diskin's, said Melvyn Aaronson, a member of the Teachers Retirement Board, which oversees the teachers' retirement system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diskin's retirement allowance is based on his final year's salary, and he was allowed to make large pension contributions for the first 20 years, Mr. Aaronson said.</p>
        <p>Now teacher contributions are limited and the Board of Education's share has been decreased. Under the existing plan, retirement allowances for someone with 14 years in the system are about $10,800 annually, and a teacher with 25 years of service might get a pension of $29,500, Mr. Aaronson said.</p>
        <p>''It's so stressful that many make a decision to retire,'' Mr. Aaronson said. ''It's not necessarily a financially sound decision, but the conditions in the schools force them to do it.''</p>
