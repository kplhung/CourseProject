        <p>SOMETIMES the simplest answer for a difficult area is ground cover.</p>
        <p>Without much thought, gardeners opt for the easy solution and in go the ubiquitous three: pachysandra, vinca and ivy.</p>
        <p>Is there nothing else? To be sure there are plenty of plants that can be selected to cover the ground, but the site and the plants have to match requirements.</p>
        <p>Of course, the best known ground cover is the lawn. But other places that often need some sort of plant could be spaces under a tree, a difficult-to-mow slope, an edge that needs finish or an area that is just to large to handle.</p>
        <p>Is the site in shade, part shade or full sun? Are there competing roots from shrubs or trees? Is the soil heavy clay? Or is it thin, shallow sand? Are there drainage problems, such as large stones below, with little or shallow root room?</p>
        <p>Then comes the plant choice. The paramount point to remember when  a plant is categorized as a ground cover is, it spreads. Some plants are better spreaders than others, but be warned. Before any ground cover is selected, know what you are getting into. You just might change your mind.</p>
        <p>Too often gardeners regret having introduced certain plants because of the plant's aggressive tendencies. Then the challenge is getting rid of it.</p>
        <p>Everyone has had some experience along these lines. Several of the worst offenders (from first-hand experience) are violets, lamium, lily of the valley, goutweed and even chrysogonum.</p>
        <p>Granted, many of these are excellent garden plants, and can be selected for ground-cover use. But the caution should also be observed that these are definitely plants to keep under control. Ruthless is a good adjective for a gardener choosing such plants.</p>
        <p>A familiar example of selecting the wrong plant for a site is to put  pachysandra in a full-sun location. Many contract landscapers are guilty of this quick fix. In no time, the pachysandra looks bedraggled and fails. A far better choice might be junipers, perennial geraniums or even selaginella. All are plants that thrive in sunny locations.</p>
        <p>Discouragement and warnings aside, however, there are many handsome reliable plants that can be selected with safety to fulfill high hopes. One of the most rewarding plants for shady areas is the handsome Asarum -- either the native ginger or the shiny-leaved European ginger. This is a handsome plant that spreads ever so slowly. It can thrive neatly under the heavy shade of trees. And if the area is kept free of fallen leaves in autumn, the little seedlings will take hold and eventually a fine mat of green will appear.</p>
        <p>Another fine plant that is showing up more each year is the super hardy Microbiota. This plant was introduced from the Siberian region where it thrives. The foliage is evergreen, often mistaken for a juniper.  Microbiota is for shade, too, and plants spaced about two feet apart eventually fill in the area.</p>
        <p>Any of the liriopes are excellent choices, too, for placement in light shade, with some sun. These grasslike plants have handsome leaves. In late summer, the odd spikes of bloom poke up followed by showy berries. One critical point if liriope is chosen. The plants must be cut back to the ground in early spring. This removes the weather-worn foliage and provides room for the splendid new growth to come up.</p>
        <p>Where there is a steep sunny slope that needs help to hold the ground, there is nothing like the ground-hugging Phlox subulata. This excellent species has a delightful spreading quality. When it expands over a hillside and blooms in whatever color is chosen, little can compete with the display. These phlox can be found in many colors ranging from deep rose  to pink to white.</p>
        <p>A favorite, but an aggressive spreader that must be controlled, is the native Chrysogonum often called Golden Star. This delightful ground-hugging plant has bright yellow flowers in May that rise up from tight foliage. Though it does spread aggressively, they can easily be kept under control by pulling up unwanted plants.</p>
        <p>The same is true for another showy spreader, Ajuga. This aggressive but handsome ground cover can even sneak into a lawn, if it is not watched. But unwanted plants are easily pulled out so the Ajuga keeps its place. A particularly handsome Ajuga is the one called Metallic Crispa with its deeply crinkled dark leaves.</p>
        <p>For a purely sunny location, few ground covers can compete with the fast-spreading sedums, especially some of the hens-and-chickens types. The splendid little plants take hold quickly and spread easily over the smallest spaces.</p>
