        <p>AS an infant, Murali Coryell lay in his baby basket, looking up wide-eyed as Jimi Hendrix peered down at him. A few months later Carlos Santana was bouncing the little boy on his lap, and on his 10th birthday Miles Davis gave him a $100 bill.</p>
        <p>No one would be surprised to learn that this child, son of the jazz guitarist Larry Coryell, grew up to become a musician and that Murali Coryell, now 30, is indeed becoming a guitar force. But he was not exactly handed an easy road to fame.</p>
        <p>Murali (whose name means ''divine flute'' in Sanskrit) could not figure out  those crazy chord changes he watched his father swing through, so Mr. Coryell -- who had neither the time nor the inclination to spoon-feed his son -- packed Murali off to guitar camp. Meanwhile, Murali's younger brother, Julian, picked it up immediately.</p>
        <p>''I used to have a little bit of a jazz inferiority complex because of my dad and my brother,'' Mr. Coryell admitted recently. ''Carlos Santana and people like that would say to me, 'Man, you've got to become a great jazzer like your dad and carry on the tradition.' So I went through a phase where I was trying to learn jazz. I tried to play Miles Davis's 'Four' with Dad, but I couldn't. I remember feeling really bummed out that I was Larry Coryell's son, and I couldn't even play 'Four'!''</p>
        <p>The father was not oblivious to his son's pain. Between world tours with Dizzy Gillespie and Betty Carter, Larry Coryell bought his son two records, Jimi Hendrix's ''Are You Experienced?'' and Steely Dan's ''Greatest Hits.''</p>
        <p>''He said, 'I think you're gonna like this song and this one and this one,' '' the younger Mr. Coryell recalled. ''He was always pointing me in the right direction. Eventually, the blues just hit me. That's what made me want to play.''</p>
        <p>The elder musician, it appears, sensed his son's gift long before anyone else.</p>
        <p>''When Murali was just a few months old, in early 1970, he was brought along, in his little basket, to the Fillmore East, where I was playing in a band with Jack Bruce and Mitch Mitchell,'' Mr. Coryell, the elder, said. ''One of those nights, Jimi Hendrix came around to hear the show and was ushered into the dressing room where baby Murali was, and he stood over Murali's basket there and checked him out. Maybe some unseen connection took place between them, because Murali grew up, like Hendrix, to play blues guitar and sing the blues.''</p>
        <p>This is no idle bragging from a proud papa. Murali Coryell does indeed have a Hendrix-style intensity to his guitar playing and a voice like Otis Redding's. Even those who do not consider themselves music aficionados -- and this writer is one -- cannot help being moved by his sound.</p>
        <p>Which is exactly how Mr. Coryell achieves most of his acclaim -- by captivating people with live shows in concert halls or coffeehouses or Chinese restaurants. (His wife, Mary, a registered nurse, first saw her future husband performing in a bar in New Paltz and decided she liked him because he looked like one of the Beatles. Asked which one, she replies, ''All of them.'')</p>
        <p>Until this year, Mr. Coryell booked and promoted all his gigs himself. His new manager, Geoff Cullerton, came on board when friends insisted he watch the guitarist at work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cullerton recalled that the owners at the Town Crier in Pawling called him and said, ''Larry Coryell's son is playing; you've got to come down here right away!'' ''So I did,'' Mr. Cullerton said. ''And I had a smile on my face within seconds after walking in the door.''</p>
        <p>Though he still plays small clubs throughout the New York metropolitan region and is only a household name in certain households, Mr. Coryell has toured with Duke Robillard, has opened for George Thorogood, Gregg Allman, B. B. King and Wilson Pickett and has been featured on CNN's ''Showbiz Today'' and the BET channel.</p>
        <p>''It's like dreams really do come true,'' said Mr. Coryell. ''You actually can grow up and meet these idols that you've grown up listening to -- and they like you! B. B. King asked me to sign a CD for him, and I was like, 'Oh, my God.' ''</p>
        <p>That CD, ''2120'' (1999, CZYZ Records), was his second and won stellar reviews. James Hunter, writing for Rolling Stone, called Mr. Coryell ''one promising new hound,'' and a reviewer at CDNow said, ''This guy can wipe the floor with most of his next-generation colleagues.''</p>
        <p>Fans have embraced him as well.</p>
        <p>''This is what blues lovers have been waiting for,'' said a fan in Santa Barbara, Calif., writing in to Amazon.com. ''A giant new talent to turn the world on for the millennium.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Coryell, who is clearly happiest when on stage, sleep is an annoyance. He had just arrived home from Chicago, where he played a gig the night before, to guzzle several mugs of extra-strong coffee while chatting through an hourlong interview. Then he jumped into the shower and tore off to play two more gigs that evening. The next morning he would begin teaching an intensive two-week course at the National Guitar Workshop in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''I'm tired, but tired-happy,'' he said. ''If I wasn't so happy, I'd be really tired.''</p>
        <p>At the first show that night, an outdoor concert in Kingston, Mr. Coryell's audience grew by the minute. Teenage boys sang along as he slid into Al Green's ''Love and Happiness.'' An older crowd tapped their feet, and Mary Coryell's parents -- a former nun and Marist Brother -- nodded joyfully. Others sat, looking hypnotized, as the roof of the stage trembled with vibration.</p>
        <p>In Chicago, not 24 hours earlier, he had performed with Shirley King (daughter of B. B. King), and there was such a synergy between them, Mr. Coryell said, that the two are talking about a King-Coryell tour ''and not telling people it's not Larry Coryell and B. B. King,'' he said jokingly. ''There is definitely a second generation out there.''</p>
        <p>Now that he has his own career and his own sound, Mr. Coryell said that playing music with his family has become a joy (his brother, Julian, is still a jazz genius, he said, sighing). The guitar trio released a CD this year, ''The Coryells'' (2000, Cheskey Records), and they will play at The Blue Note in Manhattan this Tuesday through next Sunday.</p>
        <p>Still, music is a serious, competitive business in the Coryell family, and the years have not changed that. The elder Mr. Coryell approaches his young collaborators not as a kindly father but like the veteran he is.</p>
        <p>''Dad is hard-line,'' the younger Murali Coryell said, laughing. ''He never gives us extra money or anything, like you might think a father would. He treats us just like other musicians. He always wants to be the center, the star. We all want to be the star.''</p>
