        <p>Jacy Cheng has a rain ritual.</p>
        <p>Each time it rains, she sandbags the basement of her home in northern Flushing and lines its doorways with plastic bags. Hers is a fight against rising storm and sewer water.</p>
        <p>When heavy rain fell on Labor Day weekend, Mrs. Cheng's basement was flooded with four inches of water, which caused an estimated $10,000 in damage.</p>
        <p>''Every time it rains, storm water comes in from the street and from the sink,'' she said. ''Everyone is in fear. We cannot live like that.''</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mrs. Cheng joined nearly 200 people at a community meeting to demand that city officials solve their problems once and for all.</p>
        <p>The neighborhood is served by only one 100-year-old sewer, for both waste water and storm water. While the area has grown tremendously in recent decades, the sewer system remained unchanged. The residents want a new, separate system for storm drainage.</p>
        <p>But city officials have another plan. Geoffrey Ryan, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection, said the city would improve drainage in some of the most overtaxed areas by adding 24 new catchbasins, which would collect and redirect water to sewage pipes, and 17 seepage basins, which would divert water into the ground.</p>
        <p>The department also plans to rebuild an existing chamber so as to better handle sudden surges of water. The project has been in the works since November, and officials hope to begin construction next spring.</p>
        <p>''This is what professional engineers have come up with, and we believe it's going to alleviate the problem,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''I'm not quite sure what the basis for their concern is.''</p>
        <p>When residents complained to Community Board 7 two years ago, an engineer who lived in the area suggested that the city build a separate storm sewer to handle heavy rains.</p>
        <p>But the city took another approach, one in which improvements were made to the existing system, and the flooding continued.</p>
        <p>''We don't want a Band-Aid fix,'' said Sophie Rallis, a 61-year-old teacher's assistant whose home has flooded each year for the past 25 years. ''We want it to be fixed once and for all.''</p>
        <p>State Senator Frank Padavan of Queens is asking the city to make a similar investment in northern Flushing that it plans to make in Bayside, which is scheduled to receive $80 million in sewage improvements.</p>
        <p>The project in northern Flushing is expected to cost $705,000.</p>
        <p>''We want that same kind of project here,'' Mr. Padavan said. ''The only permanent solution is the installation of new larger combined sewers.</p>
        <p>''We are going to have to bump heads,'' he said.</p>
