        <p>DIVIDEND reinvestment plans can offer small investors, especially bargain hunters, an inexpensive way to buy shares. And now may be a good time to use them to build stakes in some market heavyweights that have been beaten down but may be poised to rebound.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T, Gannett and Edison International, all of which offer DRIP's, as these plans are called, have been trading at or near their 52-week lows and thus worth a look, experts say. For those willing to shop, there are plenty of other examples.</p>
        <p>With DRIP's, investors can buy stock in small amounts, even in fractions, directly from the company or a transfer agent and usually for less than what brokers charge. By investing small amounts regularly, investors avoid the dangers of trying to time the market. And, as the name implies, the dividends are reinvested automatically.</p>
        <p>While DRIP's provide flexibility, not all plans are the same, and in some cases investors may do better buying through discount online brokers, who may charge $5 to $10 a trade. Some companies now charge enrollment fees for DRIP's, while others require monthly minimum investments or assess trading fees that are similar to those of some brokers online.</p>
        <p>''You don't want to pay a fee if it amounts to more than 2 percent of your transaction,'' said Charles B. Carlson, editor of DRIP Investor, a newsletter in Hammond, Ind. His Web site, www.dripinvestor.com, provides a list of plans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carlson said DRIP's are offered by about 1,300 companies, up from 850 in 1984. The number has grown by about 20 percent in the last five years alone, he said, primarily because more foreign companies have started to offer the plans. As many as five million investors are enrolled in DRIP's, he estimated.</p>
        <p>Among the companies offering DRIP's are various utilities and real estate investment trusts. Robert J. Grossman, a managing director at Fitch, the credit rating service, likes both groups because of their stability and high dividend yields. Examples in the utilities sector include American Water Works and Dominion Resources, and, among the REIT's, Home Properties of New York.</p>
        <p>''The purpose is to have your dividends reinvested and to buy at a discount,'' he said. ''This is never going to be a sexy investment.''</p>
        <p>DRIP's may hold little appeal to  investors who like to move quickly in and out of stocks, because the plans offer much less control over price. A delay of three to five days is often built into prices because many companies buy shares for their DRIP plans only weekly, and average out the price.</p>
        <p>Still, ''it's a way for people who don't have a lot of money to pick one company and support it over a lot of years,'' said Vita Nelson, editor of Moneypaper, a newsletter in Mamaroneck, N.Y., on DRIP's.</p>
        <p>To get started, investors typically must buy at least one share, either  through the company or its transfer agent. Investors can then buy shares or pieces of shares for as little as $10 to $50 a month. Enrollment fees usually range from $10 to $15. After that, investments can be made directly through the company at no fee or for a nominal charge, say, $5 a trade.</p>
        <p>Companies like Coca-Cola and Intel offer dividend reinvestment plans with no fees. But Disney and McDonald's, among others, have hefty entry requirements. At Disney, investors must buy at least $1,000 in shares or be willing to make a monthly commitment of $100, with a $10 setup fee. Trades cost $5, plus 4 cents a share.</p>
        <p>McDonald's requires a $500 investment or a monthly minimum investment of $50, plus a $5 setup fee. Each purchase costs $6 if made by check and $1.50 by automatic draft.</p>
        <p>DRIP investors must also be careful about record-keeping. Small, frequent purchases of stocks can mean  heavy paperwork if shares are sold, to determine the capital gains.</p>
        <p>Jim Wilson, 68, of Barrington, Ill., has investments in 15 DRIP companies, and saves his quarterly reports and year-end statements to help in his tax calculations. That can be cumbersome, but he still finds DRIP investing worthwhile. ''The neat thing about it,'' he said, ''is that all the dividends go into buying additional stock.''</p>
