        <p>THERE'S a new stop on the standard rock career path.

        <p>THERE'S a new stop on the standard rock career path. It comes after the lean years of barnstorming or singing at talent shows, after the big break, after the hit singles and platinum discs. It comes after the arena tours, the ballooming egos, the groupies and booze and drugs, after the affairs and bickering that shatter lifelong friendships, after the spectacular mishaps. It comes after the failed solo albums, after the lawsuits with ex-managers and ex-wives, after the stint in rehab.</p>
        <p>The new next step, preferably taken while the cinders of a burned-out career are still smoking, is to appear on VH1's ''Behind the Music'' and tell all the details of good times and bad moves. ''Behind the Music,'' an hourlong biography of a hitmaker's career peaks and valleys, has become VH1's signature show. Its episode on Tina Turner was nominated for an Emmy Award.</p>
        <p>Ever cognizant of how short a pop career can be, ''Behind the Music'' winds up its third year on the air with an anniversary special tonight at 9. It will mix taped highlights from previous shows with new appearances by some of its subjects. Among them are the pop rocker turned soap opera star turned pop idol, Rick Springfield, and the rowdy, heavily hair sprayed, groupie-loving rock band that thrived on MTV in the 1980's, Poison. The show's new season begins Oct. 1 with an episode on Cat Stevens.</p>
        <p>As regular viewers know, ''Behind the Music'' is an anthology of stupid pop star tricks, deluded business decisions, youthful indiscretions and reality checks that bounced. ''Behind the Music'' has joined the movie ''This Is Spinal Tap'' as a benchmark for big-time music business behavior and misbehavior. ''It's Rock Star 101,'' says Jeff Gaspin, an originator and executive producer of the show. ''These really are training tapes for artists, including what not to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaspin notes that most episodes of ''Behind the Music'' boil down to an archetypal structure. ''There's the rise and struggle, the success or excess, the downward spiral and then redemption,'' he says. ''That probably fits 90 percent of the stories.''</p>
        <p>The show has documented how M.C. Hammer could make $30 million and end up broke; how the members of Fleetwood Mac played musical beds, wrecked their marriages and made the multimillion-selling album ''Rumours'' about it; how Lisa (Left Eye) Lopes of TLC burned down a boyfriend's mansion; how Iggy Pop survived heroin addiction and stage shows where he'd cut himself with broken glass.</p>
        <p>''Behind the Music'' has also tracked down onetime teenage idols like Leif Garrett and David Cassidy. ''All their stories are the same,'' Mr. Gaspin says. ''They were kids, they were all manipulated, they wanted to be rock stars and were made into pop stars. It's very telling about what current artists are going through. The 'N Syncs, Backstreet Boys and 98 Degrees will probably be telling these same stories someday.''</p>
        <p>''Behind the Music'' is made with the cooperation of its subjects, who are willing to risk embarrassment to be back in the spotlight. Facts are checked and double-checked, and VH1 - not the show's subject - has final approval.</p>
        <p>''We wouldn't get the kind of stories we get unless these people decided to tell them,'' Mr. Gaspin says. ''It seems there's something about talking publicly that helps. Sometimes the idea seems to be, 'Let me just set the record straight, because if I don't tell it somebody else will.' ''</p>
        <p>''A lot of famous people are always careful about what they do publicly,'' he adds. ''They're managed, publicized, told where to go, pushed and pulled. But when you get them alone with nobody to tell them what to say, they're honest. I can only imagine that it must feel good.''</p>
        <p>The exposure doesn't hurt, particularly since ''Behind the Music'' is run and rerun half a dozen times in a week. Old albums can start selling again, and Lynyrd Skynyrd reported a 30 percent rise in concert ticket sales after its ''Behind the Music'' was telecast.</p>
        <p>The first episode of ''Behind the Music'' was the tale of Milli Vanilli, the telegenic pop duo who, it was revealed, didn't sing on their album, and were stripped of their best new artist Grammy Award for 1989 when that fact was revealed. After years as a punch line and then a trivia question, Milli Vanilli's Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus were eager to tell their story, crises and all. The episode was initially planned as a pilot, but it went so well that Mr. Gaspin decided to skip any testing and make ''Behind the Music'' a series.</p>
        <p>The show has found plenty of stories to choose from. ''More often than not, it's only a three-year gig at the top,'' Mr. Gaspin says. ''And it ends, and you never expect it, and you don't plan for it. But while it's happening, there's a sense of invincibility that comes along with the attention and a lot of money and people clawing for you. When you're surrounded by people who are your servants, you can't help but feel godlike. How can they have a normal life? This isn't normal.''</p>
        <p>At first, the show was devoted to the most spectacular flameouts and resurrections, which Mr. Gaspin calls ''the low-hanging fruit.'' More recently, it has detailed the upward climb of performers who still have vital careers, like Metallica, Madonna and Dr. Dre. In February, VH1 tried a half-hour spinoff, ''Behind the Music 2,'' for younger stars like Mary J. Blige; the show didn't last, perhaps because its subjects hadn't had enough colorful setbacks. Lately, Mr. Gaspin has been eyeing country music, which is full of flamboyantly turbulent stories. But for the moment, ''Behind the Music'' has a waiting list of potential subjects in rock, pop, rhythm-and-blues and hip-hop.</p>
        <p>''Every story is about sex, drugs and rock'n'roll,'' Mr. Gaspin says. ''Actually, it should be sex, drugs, money and rock 'n' roll, because money is a huge player in these stories. This is what we all know rock 'n' roll is. Rock 'n' roll isn't supposed to be pretty; it's supposed to be lurid. So why is anyone surprised when it is?''</p>
