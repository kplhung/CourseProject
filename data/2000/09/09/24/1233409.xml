        <p>At a rally for his own local party leaders this week, Frances Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, tried to whip up some enthusiasm for the referendum France is holding on Sunday to de- cide whether to cut the presidents term from seven to five years.</p>
        <p>A yes vote would institute the most radical constitutional reform in dec- ades. Some say the measure though only a sentence-long amend- ment to the Constitution would be tantamount to creating Frances Sixth Republic.</p>
        <p>But inside a small theater in Paris where Mr. Jospin waited to speak, the atmosphere was hardly electric. The prime minister took his turn at the podium after five other party officials, who read off their argu- ments for the change much as if they were making a presentation in front of their social studies teacher.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jospin argued that the shorter term would likely eliminate Frances awkward periods of cohabitation like the one France is experiencing now, where the president and the prime minister belong to different parties. This has happened three times in the last 15 years.</p>
        <p>A five-year term would also keep the president on his toes, Mr. Jospin said. ''Let him come more often be- fore the French people,'' he said. ''It is a way of making sure he is respon- sible to them.'' But he acknowledged that the vast majority of French citizens were unlikely to bother to go to the polls this weekend.</p>
        <p>Right now, you could scour Paris for a poster on the issue and not find one, or flip television channels for hours and not hear a word about the vote. The one newspaper that did bother last week to print two full pages of interviews with voters indi- cated that most felt that the referen- dum was either too complicated or too boring to bother with.</p>
        <p>The low turnout is expected to help the no vote. But experts still believe that the measure will pass. Surveys suggest that the French  though unmotivated by the referendum  are overwhelmingly in favor of shortening the presidency, bringing it into line with other presidential terms in the European Union.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is that the issue lacks the excitement of a good political battle. On this issue, Mr. Jospin and his archrival, Frances Gaullist president, Jacques Chirac, are awkward bedfellows. And unsure who will get credit for victory, nei- ther has campaigned much or loosed party purse strings for advertising.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jospins speech on Tuesday to party officials who are supposed to bring in the vote was the prime min- isters first and only scheduled effort in support of the measure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac is hardly doing better. Since he dropped his longstanding opposition to the idea and proposed the five-year term last June, he has campaigned for the vote on fewer than a half-dozen occasions. Earlier this month, for instance, he went to a Paris suburb and parried with school children.</p>
        <p>One young boy asked if seven years did not give a president more time to think things through. ''If five years isnt enough,'' Mr. Chirac an- swered, ''then you were not born for the job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac was actually making one of his rare appearances to pro- mote his view when news broke on Thursday that a former aide who died last year had made a confession on videotape accusing the president of taking kickbacks in the 1980s. But whether the images of the former fund-raiser detailing how he ran a slush fund under Mr. Chiracs in- structions will affect Sundays vote remains unclear.</p>
        <p>Some analysts believe it may prod voters to go to to the polls to increase the accountability of their president, but others think that Frances al- ready cynical voters may stay away to register their disgust.</p>
        <p>Almost everyone who has run for the presidency since Charles de Gaulle left politics in 1969 has prom- ised to cut the presidential term. But once ensconced in the lydegreessee Palace, the winners have all let the matter gather dust. The former president, Franois Mitterrand, called the sev- en-year terms an ongoing coup dtatwhen he was running for of- fice. Then, he served two of them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac had always opposed the five-year term until June when he abruptly changed his mind. But polit- ical analysts see a clever political end run by Mr. Chirac, who is 68 years old. He plainly intends to run again in 2002 and is likely to face a tough battle from Mr. Jospin, 63, who though currently suffering in the polls because of recent fuel protests has generally won extraordinarily high approval ratings.</p>
        <p>Under the current rules of the game, Mr. Chirac would be 77 at the end of another term, which might put some voters off. By reducing the presidents term to five years, Mr. Chirac could help eliminate the issue of his age in the campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jospin, however, found him- self with little room to maneuver. Having called for the change for years, he could hardly try to block the issue.</p>
