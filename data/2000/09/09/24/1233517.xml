        <p>HASSENFELD-Harold. The Jewish Theological Seminary family records with sorrow the passing of Harold Hassenfeld whose commitment to JTS and Jewish education was reflected in the life he lived with his beloved wife Rita Dee and their family. The Hassenfeld's longtime support was uniquely evident in their sponsorship of Dr. Schorsch's Weekly parashah commentary, a singular vehicle for teaching Judaism that reaches an evergrowing international community. Our hearts go out to Rita Dee, his children,his grandchildren and the entire family. May his memory be for a blessing. Ismarschorsch, Chancellor Gershonkekst, Chairman</p>
