        <p>AS most every marketing student  knows, Harley-Davidson sets the standard in consumer loyalty. Its devoted customers tattoo Harley's logo on their flesh. Has anyone ever seen a bicep embossed with Coca-Cola's logo?</p>
        <p>But ''More Than a Motorcycle:  The Leadership Journey at Harley-Davidson'' (Harvard Business School Press, $24.95), by Rich Teerlink and Lee Ozley, is not the place to find the Harley legend. The book has little to say about the design, manufacture or marketing of Harley's immensely popular top-end bikes. It includes only a few pages on the Harley resurrection: how, two decades ago, Harley was pummeled by Japanese competition, or how, shielded by a temporary tariff, it scratched its way back to prosperity (after laying off 4 of every 10 employees). Nor does it explain how Harley managed to extend its outlaw aura to the thousands of law-abiding citizens who slip into their leathers and go tooling on its bikes.</p>

        <p>AS most every marketing student  knows, Harley-Davidson sets the standard in consumer loyalty. Its devoted customers tattoo Harley's logo on their flesh. Has anyone ever seen a bicep embossed with Coca-Cola's logo?</p>
        <p>But ''More Than a Motorcycle:  The Leadership Journey at Harley-Davidson'' (Harvard Business School Press, $24.95), by Rich Teerlink and Lee Ozley, is not the place to find the Harley legend. The book has little to say about the design, manufacture or marketing of Harley's immensely popular top-end bikes. It includes only a few pages on the Harley resurrection: how, two decades ago, Harley was pummeled by Japanese competition, or how, shielded by a temporary tariff, it scratched its way back to prosperity (after laying off 4 of every 10 employees). Nor does it explain how Harley managed to extend its outlaw aura to the thousands of law-abiding citizens who slip into their leathers and go tooling on its bikes.</p>
        <p>''More Than a Motorcycle'' is about something more elusive. It is about changing a company's thinking. It describes a decade-long effort at Harley to reshape its corporate culture and to transform the way it makes decisions. Having weathered its crisis of survival, when emphatic leadership was essential, Harley decided that it needed a far more collaborative style.</p>
        <p>Instead of command and control from the top down, Harley had a vision of the people closest to a problem resolving it by consensus. It wanted everyone to shoulder responsibility for decisions.</p>
        <p>Students of business organization could take this instructive account as a textbook; unfortunately, it reads like one. Not everyone will like ''More Than a Motorcycle'' or have the patience for the hard slogging it requires.</p>
        <p>The authors have thorough, insiders' knowledge. Mr. Teerlink, Harley's dominant figure, is now retired  as chairman and chief executive.  The son of a tool-and-die maker who owned a small factory, he grew up with a respect for the shop floor. In the book's spare descriptions, he comes across as cerebral and persistent, a practical visionary.</p>
        <p>From the onset, he grasped the paradox: Top management could not  just impose a system intended to replace top-down management. The people at Harley had to find their way to that destination.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Teerlink's side was Mr. Ozley, a consultant and counselor who helped the Harley people think through the various stages. He was proud of his independence; in one bumpy phase, he was prepared to walk away. In fact, he had originally earned Harley's respect by declining an assignment he thought wrong for the company. At the outset, he warned that progress would come not in home runs but in scratch singles.</p>
        <p>The authors usually write in the third person about a process in which they were the leading participants.  But every so often they revert awkwardly to the first person: ''we (Rich and Lee).'' And every few pages, one (or both) delivers an extended commentary, just as an actor steps out of a scene to address the audience directly.</p>
        <p>The narrative is an analytical and abstract look at the step-by-step process of inventing new ways of working together. Except for a few allusions to the hot demand for Harley motorcycles, the authors might as well be talking about widgets.</p>
        <p>And maybe that's fine. The lessons from Harley are general enough to fit a broad range of companies. Many are trying to reshape their decision-making in the direction that Harley took. The exercises here may be familiar to more than a few business readers.</p>
        <p>Harley's experience is especially interesting because the company is unionized. Most books on corporate change are written as though unions do not exist, but here the authors describe how they involved the International Association of Machinists and the United Paper Workers International Union in continuing diplomacy. The unions were invited into the process of change, and on equal footing with management. At one point,  the parties negotiated a contract largely by achieving consensus, in contrast with the usual adversarial route.</p>
        <p>When Harley was desperate for greater capacity, the company and unions cooperated in designing and locating a new plant. Harley gave up the thought of building it in a state hostile to unions, eventually choosing Kansas City, Mo. -- and in return the unions accepted plant design and work force changes to give Harley substantial productivity gains. Harley agreed to a no-layoffs policy.  Most remarkably, the unions and the company formally accepted responsibility for each other's prosperity.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, Mr. Teerlink and Mr. Ozley gathered senior executives and union officials and had them sketch their visions of the ideal Harley company. They compared that vision with the present, imperfect Harley and tried to figure out how to get from A to B. Their thinking was ratified by larger and larger groups of employees. Shop floor-level commitees were set up to overcome hundreds of barriers to progress.</p>
        <p>This effort, the Joint Vision Project, was taking hold when the United Paper Workers jolted everyone by dropping out. ''Lots of talk about changes, but no action,'' the union's leadership said in a statement. Mr. Teerlink and Mr. Ozley decided that they had a poor grasp of union politics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Teerlink was always eager for results. He sent top executives to a hotel for ''awareness expansion''; they were lectured by business scholars and herded into groups to build  bridges from Tinker Toy parts. The executives found this good fun and got into the swing of things. Mr. Teerlink decided that their responses were too passive, however, and  chewed them out in a closing speech.</p>
        <p>Then came a process that required the company to think through its core values and define its mission,  objectives and strategies -- down to the goals for various groups of workers. The results stood until last year, when Harley amended its mission from making motorcycles, parts and accessories to something loftier: ''We fulfill dreams through the experiences of motorcycling.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, Harley decided to group its employees, without regard for department boundaries, into ''natural work circles'' that met challenges and solved problems. Because product designers should respond to customer demand, for example, someone from sales should join the design team.</p>
        <p>For an organization still unaccustomed to consensus-building, the circle arrangements presented some frustrations. People wanted to know who was in charge. ''The circle organization takes the big bosses out of the circle,'' one executive said in the book. ''You call them 'coaches.' They're still there, but now their job is to mentor and help, rather than make decisions.''</p>
        <p>SOMETIMES, the authors write about these changes as if for someone who already knows the company. Executives take the  stage identified only by their names and titles, with no description of personal details or notable traits, and no photographs. There are no descriptions of factories or offices, or anything to provide a setting. The book never illustrates how the new thinking affected a concrete business decision, apart from the new plant site.</p>
        <p>And the authors seldom resist the urge to abbreviate. The reader must keep track of PDL2T (process development leadership and learning team) and FLG (functional leadership group), not to mention AEII, LSC, JLG, JVP, JPIC, CDC, HDMC, HDU and many others. One group was renamed because its abbreviation was already taken. Then there is the exotic-sounding acronym Hwikiwisi, pronounced hee-wee-kuh-WEE-see and meaning ''How will I know it when I see it?''</p>
        <p>The Harley experience was a fascinating example of the cultural transformation of a major corporation. But Mr. Teerlink and Mr. Ozley, in recounting the story step by step, cannot escape the flat prose of the business world.</p>
