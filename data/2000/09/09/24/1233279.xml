        <p>IN recent years, it has sometimes seemed that if it wasn't for bad news, there would be little news at all for Mitsubishi. For several years, the company was dogged by complaints of sexual harassment in its Normal, Ill., assembly plant. In 1998, the president of the Japanese parent company resigned over illegal payments to gangsters. His successor, Katsuhiko Kawasoe, announced his resignation this month after the company was embarrassed by reports that it had concealed customer complaints for two decades.</p>
        <p>Things were looking up, though, for the American sales operation, Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, which broke even in 1998 for the first time in a decade. Profits have risen since then, and sales are expected to reach 300,000 this year, up from 190,515 in 1998.</p>
        <p>But then last week, Automotive News, the industry's leading trade publication, published an article that said the company had falsified sales records and possibly jeopardized customer warranties.</p>
        <p>The article portrayed deception unfolding like scenes from ''Glengarry Glen Ross,'' David Mamet's play about desperate, amoral salesmen. In late-night sessions, regional sales managers entered false sales data, seeking to inflate the region's total to meet corporate objectives and outsell other regions, the article said. The managers entered names like Patty O. Furniture, Bud Weiser and Supa Mann as the buyers of cars on dealers' lots. Automotive News quoted an unidentified source as saying that thousands of cars had been ''sold'' this way.</p>
        <p>Dealers never knew about the fake sales until a legitimate buyer wanted the car -- and the dealer would find it listed on the computerized inventory as sold, Automotive News reported. The region would then ''back out'' the false sale and enter information about the real buyer.</p>
        <p>Mitsubishi concedes that false sales were entered, but said the numbers were in the hundreds, not the thousands. The company said it began an investigation after a sales manager in Atlanta reported the falsifications in May. Memos went out condemning the practice, and regional sales managers were barred from entering sales data.</p>
        <p>The article also raised the issue of whether the legitimate buyers might lose warranty coverage if their cars had been reported as sold at an earlier date. Automotive News reported that the warranty clock started with the false sale, not the actual sale. But a Mitsubishi spokesman, Kim Custer, said the warranties start from the date of delivery to the customer.  In the normal course of business, information about an actual sale would overwrite any false data.</p>
        <p>Defending the integrity of the company's sales totals, Mr. Custer said any cars sold falsely ultimately went out the door as legitimate sales. To maintain the accuracy of its database, the company periodically asks auditors to compare its records with title registrations, which represent actual sales. For 1999, Mitsubishi said the auditor found a 5 percent discrepancy, which it said was well within the norm for its automotive clients.</p>
        <p>Overzealous sales reporting has a long history in the business. Art Spinella of CNW Marketing/Research, in Bandon, Ore., said, ''Falsifying sales records has been going on for years and years and years, and has been done in a whole raft of ways.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes it is done for bragging rights. Cadillac lost face two years ago when it claimed sales leadership for 1998 over its archrival, Lincoln, only to back down a few weeks later when independent figures showed that Cadillac had come up short.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the falsifications are done for money. If a dealership or salesman is a few units short of reaching a target for a bonus, the temptation is great to fudge the sale of a few cars, which would then be sold for real the next month.</p>
        <p>From a customer's perspective, the risk of having a warranty jeopardized this way is low. It is wise, however, to double-check the date of delivery on your car's records when you buy it and when you bring it in for the first service.</p>
