      <abstract>
        <p>Michael Parfit replies to author Charles Pellegrino's letter on his August 27 review of book, Ghosts of the Titanic (S)</p>
      </abstract>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Charles Pellegrino wrote in ''Ghosts of the Titanic'' that life is one of the ''dominant conditions'' of the abyssal plains. I disagreed with that description. Now he argues that he was referring to life smaller than an aspirin. However, microbial life is present almost everywhere, including many deserts. In those places, as on the abyssal plains, life is not a dominant condition.</p>
        <p>The quotations I cite in my review amply illustrate the way Pellegrino engineers an inaccurate impression that he is Robert Ballard's scientific colleague. Ballard's brief citation of the downblast theory -- the only mention of Pellegrino in the main text of ''The Discovery of the Titanic'' -- does not contradict that. In that mention, Ballard describes Pellegrino as a writer, not a fellow scientist.</p>
        <p>Pellegrino attempts to brand me as an opponent of the salvage of Titanic artifacts and thus imply that my review was prejudiced. This is untrue. I have never been sympathetic to either side of that debate.</p>
