        <p>Dramatic front-page news about Orson Welles's ''Citizen Kane'' [''Was it Citizen Hearst or Citizen Welles?'' by David Thomson, Sept. 17]! Much-acclaimed movie is more about Welles than Hearst! Did Welles ever say the film was about Hearst?

Much-acclaimed movie is more about Welles than Hearst! Did Welles ever say the film was about Hearst?

        <p>Mr. Thomson resents, I think, all that old black-and-white populist edginess to ''Citizen Kane.'' So we get revisionism. San Simeon was a beautiful place full of beautiful, elegant people, and Hearst died surrounded by his loved ones. Welles died alone. So what? Welles was an artist and a revolutionary, not an insurance man or a publisher, or a critic, for that matter.</p>
