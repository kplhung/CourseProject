        <p>The violent images, the headlines and the public recriminations have faded, but the legal battles quietly continue long after the disturbances that rocked Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and took the life of a Hasidic scholar nine years ago.</p>
        <p>Yankel Rosenbaum, 29, a doctoral student in history from Australia, was stabbed during four days of violence in August 1991 after an accident in which a car driven by another Hasidic man struck and killed a black 7-year-old, Gavin Cato.</p>
        <p>Lemrick Nelson Jr. and Charles Price were convicted in 1997 on federal charges of violating Mr. Rosenbaum's civil rights: Mr. Nelson by stabbing him and Mr. Price by inciting the crowd at the scene of the accident and later urging the assault on Mr. Rosenbaum several blocks away. Mr. Nelson had been acquitted of murder charges in a state trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nelson, now 25, is serving a 19 1/2-year sentence at a federal prison in Beaumont, Tex. Mr. Price, 47, is serving 21 years at a prison in Leavenworth, Kan.</p>
        <p>But their convictions are still being appealed. Among the arguments being made in the United States Court of Appeals in Manhattan is that in an effort to have the verdict perceived as fair, the trial judge, David G. Trager of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, improperly allowed racial considerations in the jury selection. The jury included three blacks and two Jews. The defense also says a recent Supreme Court decision invalidates the statutory basis for the Crown Heights prosecution.</p>
        <p>A prosecutor, Alan Vinegrad, said that both sides agreed on the jury selection process, and that the Supreme Court ruling did not undermine the Crown Heights case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Price is hopeful that his appeal will succeed, said Darrell L. Paster, one of his lawyers. A lawyer for Mr. Nelson, Trevor  Headley, said his client ''looks forward to the day when he'll be released, whether by appeal or by serving his sentence.''</p>
