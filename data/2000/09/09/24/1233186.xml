        <p>A FEW years ago, Romano Denaro was a corporate executive in Manhattan. Each evening he was driven home to Harrison, where he and his wife had three sons in private school and many friends. He liked playing golf and had season tickets to the Metropolitan Opera.</p>
        <p>Now he lives alone in a small apartment in Genoa, Italy. He is forbidden from returning to the United States, where he lived for 32 years and where his family remains, so he spends his days writing letters here -- to immigration advocates, diplomatic groups and politicians. He relies on support from relatives because he cannot get working papers. Italy considers him an American.</p>
        <p>Mr. Denaro, 47, was deported in May after a 1998 felony conviction for taking part in a $2 million check-cashing scheme. He served a year in state prison and another six months in immigration detention centers before being deported.</p>
        <p>''My marriage, my kids, everything I've worked for the last 30 years has been torn from me,'' he said by telephone last week. ''Sometimes I think I'm having a terrible nightmare.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Denaro pleaded guilty to a fraud charge, after he says his lawyer assured him he would not face deportation, a claim the lawyer denies. Mr. Denaro admits his crime, but he adds that he is being punished with ''a life sentence,'' separating him from his home and family.</p>
        <p>After his arrest, his marriage fell apart, and his ex-wife now forbids their children to speak to him by phone, he said. Mr. Denaro's relatives and friends have hired a lawyer to reopen his criminal case, but so far there has been no progress.</p>
        <p>''How can a decent man like this lose everything he worked his whole life for?'' said Bruce Adler, a retired teacher from Harrison and Mr. Denaro's best friend since college. ''This is not justice. He did his time. There are murderers who wouldn't go through what he's going through.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Denaro's current lawyer, Vincent Gelardi of White Plains, said that a motion filed in April in State Supreme Court in White Plains to reopen Mr. Denaro's case was denied in August. Mr. Gelardi said he was planning to file an appeal in federal court based on Mr. Denaro's claim that he only pleaded guilty in 1998 because his lawyer at the time, Bruce C. Mandia, said he would not be deported. He also claims that the judge failed to warn him of that risk, as required by law.</p>
        <p>Mr. Denaro fell victim to laws passed in 1996 requiring the deportation of any noncitizen convicted of a felony drawing at least a one-year sentence (the previous threshold was five years). The laws also stripped immigration judges of discretion to allow relief to longtime residents of the United States. The Immigration and Naturalization Service deported 62,359 immigrants with criminal records in 1999, up 72 percent from when the new laws were enacted.</p>
        <p>Now many legislators are pushing to have the laws eased, especially those denying relief to immigrants like Mr. Denaro.</p>
        <p>''There is broad bipartisan agreement that the '96 laws went way too far and hurt many American families,'' said Carol Wolchok, director of the American Bar Association Center for Immigration Law and Representation. ''Every day another family is destroyed. They need to be reversed as soon as possible. We're a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants, and it is important that our laws be fair to immigrants.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Denaro immigrated with his family from Italy in 1968 when he was 15. He graduated from Iona College with a degree in accounting and classical history. In the 1980's, he was a comptroller for several Manhattan companies, earning more than $100,000 a year.</p>
        <p>But he left the corporate world and started a delivery business in Westchester. In 1996 he was introduced to a Nynex executive who promised him $50,000 if he cashed some Nynex checks the man had drawn illegally.</p>
        <p>Mr. Denaro said he agreed because his business was declining and his family needed money. His office building had burned down, and the bank was foreclosing on his house. He said that when he tried to back out, the executive threatened him and his family.</p>
        <p>As part of the scheme, Mr. Denaro said he submitted fake invoices for $430,000 and pocketed less than $80,000. In 1996, he and three other men involved in the scheme were arrested.</p>
        <p>Mr. Denaro, who had never been arrested before, found his lawyer, Mr. Mandia, in the phone book.</p>
        <p>He said he pleaded guilty after Mr. Mandia told him that there was no chance of deportation and that he would probably get only community service or 90 days in the county jail. Mr. Denaro also faulted Mr. Mandia for failing to advise him to apply for citizenship during the months he was out on bail before his arraignment. Mr. Denaro said he never applied to become a United States citizen because ''I was busy working, building a career and raising a family.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mandia, contacted at his office in Rye, said applying for citizenship would not have helped Mr. Denaro. He also said he told Mr. Denaro he could be deported.</p>
        <p>''He knew the facts,'' Mr. Mandia said. ''He knew he would do state prison time and that there was a possibility he could get deported.</p>
        <p>''The sentencing was appropriate and in line with the penal law guidelines,'' Mr. Mandia said. ''It was the immigration side that was harsh.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Denaro said that Mr. Mandia was often late to hearings, which annoyed the judges. At the sentencing hearing, Mr. Mandia was 35 minutes late, and according to court transcripts, Justice Steven R. Sirkin spent most of the hearing berating Mr. Mandia for it.</p>
        <p>The judge said he was furious that Mr. Mandia was late because he himself had driven a long distance that morning to court.</p>
        <p>''I shook my head and said 'I'm finished,' '' Mr. Denaro recalled.</p>
        <p>The judge said he ''would keep my options open to probation'' but wound up giving Mr. Denaro a one-to-three-year sentence, qualifying him to be deported. Nowhere in the transcript of the sentencing hearing does Judge Sirkin tell Mr. Denaro of the possibility that he could be deported.</p>
        <p>The judge did, however, tell Mr. Denaro: ''Incidentally, this sentence in no way reflects my frustration and anger at your lawyer.'' (Mr. Mandia also denied that it influenced the sentencing.)</p>
        <p>After he served his prison sentence, the Immigration and Naturalization Service told Mr. Denaro that he was to be deported and an immigration judge would review his case. At a hearing last year, Mr. Denaro expressed his bewilderment as to why he was being given a ''life sentence'' for a first offense.</p>
        <p>Judge Mitchell Levinsky observed that Mr. Denaro had never been arrested in 31 years in the United States and told Mr. Denaro ''I believe that there are compelling circumstances'' to grant more time to try to have his criminal charges overturned, according to the hearing transcript.</p>
        <p>''We're not talking about a murder conviction,'' the judge said. ''We're talking about a grand larceny conviction.''</p>
        <p>He added that Mr. Denaro ''probably would win on appeal,'' adding that he thought ''there are compelling equitable humanitarian factors'' to allow him to pursue such an appeal before his deportation.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Denaro was unable to get his conviction overturned in the two months he was given. Before deportation, he was put in solitary confinement at a detention center in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Denaro, a diabetic, went on a hunger strike and refused to take his diabetes medication, hoping that he would be declared medically unable to fly. He lost 15 pounds and stayed in bed with only a Bible in the cell, he said.</p>
        <p>After two weeks, a guard let him use a pay phone, and Mr. Denaro called a reporter for The New York Times. The Times called the Immigration Service press office and got no response. Several days later, Mr. Denaro was deported.</p>
        <p>Mr. Denaro's attempt to overturn his criminal conviction is complicated by the fact that the Immigration Service forbids him to return to America.</p>
        <p>Richard L. Kenney, a spokesman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review in Virginia, which oversees the immigration courts, said Mr. Denaro had exhausted his chances to appeal for return.</p>
        <p>''This isn't a serious crime in terms of the harm done,'' Mr. Kenney said, ''but the law isn't very flexible in terms of discretion by immigration judges, and people are deported for this lack of discretion.</p>
        <p>''Even many people enforcing the laws say that in some cases they are too harsh,'' he said. ''The immigration judges' hands are tied in the sense that the only way for them to avoid something like this is to not enforce the law and look the other way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Denaro's best chance for return hinges on bills pending in Congress that would ease some of the 1996 laws, allowing long-term legal immigrants to seek a waiver to a deportation order.</p>
        <p>''How can they take someone who worked in the U.S., was educated in the U.S., got married and had children in the U.S. and paid taxes for 32 years and turn him into an exile?'' Mr. Denaro said. ''Now I'm an outcast in two countries.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Denaro's parents, in their 70's, live in Harrison. His sister, Sandra Vacchio, 40, lives in Dutchess County. She said she is taking money from her salary as an office administrator, from her retirement savings and from her mother's Social Security to help pay Mr. Denaro's legal fees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Denaro's sons live in an apartment in Harrison with his ex-wife, Eileen, a nurse in White Plains. She refused to comment for this article.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vacchio called her brother a dedicated family man, adding that his ex-wife has not forgiven him for becoming involved in the fraud scheme.</p>
        <p>These days, Mr. Denaro reads American newspapers and magazines. His favorite authors are Virgil, Dante and Melville, but lately he has been reading Ovid's ''Metamorphoses,'' he said, and likens himself to the author who in the book is exiled, ''suffering terribly and looking across the ocean at his homeland waiting to be allowed to return.''</p>
