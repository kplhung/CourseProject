      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>At the Shelburne Museum in Vermont, many of the 37 buildings on the museum grounds display such valuable and fragile items as antique clocks, dolls, quilts and samplers -- to say nothing of works by Degas, Monet, Manet and Cassatt. But at two buildings, the 1950 House and the Settlers' House, do touch is the rule.</p>
        <p>At the six-room, ranch-style 1950 House, which opened in June and will be on display through 2001, visitors can relax on a sofa and leaf through an issue of National Geographic or Life or a Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew mystery while listening to the music of Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Benny Goodman, among others. To find the house, look for a Studebaker in the driveway.</p>

        <p>At the Settlers' House, which also opened in June, visitors can handle such late-18th-century reproduction furnishings as a cornhusk mattress bed, Windsor chairs and ceramic and pewter dishes.</p>
