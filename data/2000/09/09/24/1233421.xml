        <p>On a hot afternoon earlier this week, a stubby, scaled-down imitation of a 1937 Ford sedan burned rubber around a quarter-mile oval track as a local race driver demonstrated driving techniques in a Legends racing car.</p>
        <p>The scene at a small speedway an hour's drive from downtown Indianapolis was just one of many similar scenes in this region with its vast number of racing series with names like sprints, midgets, bandaleros, karts, dragsters, Indy cars and stock cars. After a nine-year absence from America, Formula One may now be added to the list with the running of the U.S. Grand Prix at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway here on Sunday.</p>

        <p>On a hot afternoon earlier this week, a stubby, scaled-down imitation of a 1937 Ford sedan burned rubber around a quarter-mile oval track as a local race driver demonstrated driving techniques in a Legends racing car.</p>
        <p>The scene at a small speedway an hour's drive from downtown Indianapolis was just one of many similar scenes in this region with its vast number of racing series with names like sprints, midgets, bandaleros, karts, dragsters, Indy cars and stock cars. After a nine-year absence from America, Formula One may now be added to the list with the running of the U.S. Grand Prix at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway here on Sunday.</p>
        <p>But while Formula One needs the potentially lucrative American market, local fans and racers, track owners and sponsors, grass-roots race car builders and promoters all wonder if America really needs Formula One.</p>
        <p>''This is the racing capital of the world,'' said Larry Fritz, the racer who gave the lessons in the so-called Legends hobby-car series. ''There are more race tracks right here in a 100-mile radius than there is nearly clear across the country. We'll see how it goes. I think the first year is wait and see.''</p>
        <p>But if Formula One and the local promoters fail to win over the local crowd, it will not be for a lack of trying. And while many people here have adopted the wait-and-see attitude, many also wish the event well -- if for no other reason than to feel that the estimated $50 million spent by the speedway to modernize its facilities was not a waste.</p>
        <p>The speedway is the world's greatest oval track, but Formula One does not race on ovals. So Tony George, the director and part of the family that has owned the track for more than 50 years, built a road course on the infield that uses only part of the oval and rebuilt the pits to suit Formula One's stringent specifications.</p>
        <p>''I don't even recognize the place anymore,'' said Fritz, echoing a frequent lament that change at the speedway will kill traditions dating back to the track's creation in 1909. But then he conceded that ''the facility has got to be state of the art as far as a standard for the whole world, and the changes have generally been for the better.''</p>
        <p>Formula One is working overtime to please: extra news conferences have been organized by the teams in hotels, and the usual 15-minute news conferences at the track are lasting three times as long to accommodate American reporters who rarely cover the series in Europe.</p>
        <p>The drivers are doing their part as well. Michael Schumacher, Jarno Trullli, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Jenson Button and Giancarlo Fisichella took time off from the track to visit the patients of a local children's hospital, and Eddie Irvine drove his Formula One car down Broadway in New York City and appeared on David Letterman's show.</p>
        <p>And anyone who sets foot near Monument Circle in the center of Indianapolis is reminded again and again of Fritz's words, as just about every public trash can is wrapped with banners that read: Racing Capital of the World.</p>
        <p>But in Gasoline Alley, a block from the speedway, it is life as usual for the local race car builders and teams. Bill East, one of the country's greatest sprint car chassis builders, said he was going to Sunday's race only because his 15-year-old son Bobby has become a Formula One fan.</p>
        <p>''It is two different worlds,'' East said of Formula One and his form of racing, which is performed on both paved and dirt-surfaced oval tracks in single-seat, open-wheel cars with protective roll cages that resemble contraptions out of ''Mad Max''.</p>
        <p>Despite his son's interest, East said: ''I don't think kids growing up in this country have dreams of going into Formula One. They more have dreams of going to Indianapolis or into Nascar. We don't have the right stepping stones to get into Formula One.''</p>
        <p>A block from East's shop lies the temporary workshop of Mo Nunn Racing, a Champ cars team, where Brad Filbey, the team manager, said he envied Formula One's commercial success and vision, but did not care for the racing.</p>
        <p>''We all watch Formula One,'' he said of his colleagues in the country's most popular form of Indy-style racing. ''We have the race on the TV on Sunday mornings when we're at the track at our hospitality area, and you sit down for breakfast and you watch the start. And as soon as the start's finished then the race is pretty much set, and they follow each other around.''</p>
        <p>But the general opinion is that if Formula One does succeed in Indianapolis, it may then call itself a true world championship.</p>
