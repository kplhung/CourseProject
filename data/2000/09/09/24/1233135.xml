        <p>AS the summer fades into fall, indoor activities become more important. And in this age of electronic addictions, many parents cast about for something to keep young fingers (and minds) occupied with something other than dot.coms and sitcoms.</p>
        <p>Something like stamp collecting, perhaps? And before visions of musty old men with magnifying glasses sweep in, take note that the hobby has changed and broadened.</p>
        <p>Stamp collectors, those fusty philatelists, used to be mainly accumulators of engraved monochrome images of important people on little rectangles of paper. Some hobbyists became known as fly-speckers, for the attention they paid to the tiniest variations in printing, paper and watermarks.</p>
        <p>In the past 20 years, the hobby has come a long way.</p>
        <p>For younger collectors, every country that issues stamps now offers far more vibrant images in much livelier formats, from cartoon characters to desert animals arrayed on a Sonoran landscape to space-age holograms.</p>
        <p>For more mature collectors, of any age, the focus has shifted from accumulating stamps to studying history, especially history illustrated by the passage of a letter from point A to point B.</p>
        <p>The biggest handicap that new collectors face is that many fewer people use stamps on their mail these days, and when they do, the stamps may not be worth collecting. Once upon a time, even the utility bill had a stamp on it; now, a birthday card from a far-distant aunt is likely to have only a routine flag stamp.</p>
        <p>The solution is what the British call kiloware, mixed bundles of stamps from around the world that have been cut away from envelopes and are sold by the pound. The paper can be trimmed neatly around the stamps or the stamps can be soaked free in warm water and then dried face down on paper towels.</p>
        <p>Another source is the penny or nickel box at a stamp dealer's table at a nearby stamp show. Such shows are frequently held in school halls and V.F.W. posts and the like, typically once a month, and are listed in local papers and national hobby weeklies. More on that later.</p>
        <p>New collectors are frequently frustrated by printed albums. Filling all those spaces will prove nearly impossible. A better idea for storage are stock sheets, black lightweight cardboard with clear strips of Mylar  that form pockets into which stamps can be inserted. The cardboard sheets have holes punched for a three-ring binder.</p>
        <p>These provide the kind of flexibility that youngsters enjoy: maybe all the French stamps on one page today, maybe all the blue stamps from everywhere on the page tomorrow. Stock sheets of different configurations typically sell in packs of five for about $5.</p>
        <p>And get a pair of stamp tongs (not tweezers) to handle the stamps; they are broad-tipped to avoid tearing and cost only a couple of dollars.</p>
        <p>If the collecting bug bites, youngsters like to focus. One popular tack is topical collecting, stamps with images of sports figures, stamps with a space theme, with animals, with Shakespeare, with any topic you can think of.</p>
        <p>The American Topical Association has nearly 200 lists of stamps worldwide on individual subjects. (Information: Box 50820, Albuquerque, N.M. 87181-0820.)</p>
        <p>Another angle in this nation of immigrants is to collect stamps from the countries Grandpa and Grandma came from, for example. This helps young hobbyists learn about their heritage.</p>
        <p>A good way for adults and children to develop a collection together is to split it chronologically: the children seek out stamps issued since they were born, for example, which can typically be found in kiloware, and the adults seek out older stamps, which may have to be purchased individually.</p>
        <p>From collecting stamps to collecting the envelopes they were used on: this is the step to postal history.</p>
        <p>Prowling through a dealer's ''dollar box'' of old envelopes (''covers'' as they are called) yields all sorts of puzzles about how mail was handled.</p>
        <p>The most interesting pieces reflect hard times: war means censorship, and millions of covers with censors' sealing tape or special rubber handstamps drift through the markets, most costing only a few dollars. A very popular (and pricier) collection could focus on Civil War covers.</p>
        <p>But postal history also involves much ''ordinary'' material: one active stamp club has compiled vast amounts of information about those anonymous-looking meter stamps that are now used on most mail.</p>
        <p>And philately overlaps deltiology, the collecting of picture postcards, boxes of which can be found in antiques stores, the more downscale the better. Hunting for old cards with pictures of your hometown is a good deal less costly than collecting original Shaker furniture.</p>
        <p>In the process of escaping from old-fogeyism, stamp collectors have moved briskly onto the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>Many new and not so new United States stamps are available through the Postal Service site at www.usps.gov.</p>
        <p>Two good umbrella sites, with links to dozens of specialized clubs and dealers, are those of the American Philatelic Society, the largest United States stamp club (www.stamps.org), and of Linn's Stamp News, a fat weekly newspaper that covers the hobby (www.linns.com).</p>
        <p>These sites (and the Yellow Pages, under ''Stamps for Collectors'') are good places to find sources nearby for stamps and supplies.</p>
        <p>They can also yield contacts with like-minded hobbyists who are just plain tuckered out after all that outdoor summer fun and plan to rest indoors until, oh, April or so.</p>
