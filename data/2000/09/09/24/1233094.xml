        <p>I'M kind of a renegade,'' the Brooklyn-born Brian Merlis says about his obsession -- an obsession with collecting that in the last 20 years has cost him $250,000 -- and his marriage. Mr. Merlis doesn't gamble, scuba dive or fly fighter planes. He is an amateur historian and a collector of photographs and artifacts who has apparently published more books on the history of his native borough than anyone else.</p>
        <p>Mr. Merlis was born in Brooklyn in 1955 and spent part of his childhood in a 1940's house at 1302 East 51st Street in Flatlands, a neighborhood that at the time was only partly built up. ''I saw Brooklyn as it was still developing,'' he said. ''I could catch butterflies in vacant lots next to 18th-century farmhouses.''</p>
        <p>As an adult he began collecting picture postcards of Brooklyn and soon expanded to ephemera -- old printed matter like posters, ads and theater programs -- and, especially, documentary photographs. ''Even as a kid, I wondered what things had looked like in the past,'' Mr. Merlis said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Merlis said that he loves to sink his eyes into the fine grain of a print from a glass plate negative: the store signs, the passersby, the life on the streets. He said he has collected more than 10,000 pieces of ephemera, 5,000 negatives and several thousand prints. ''Images are what run the world these days,'' said Mr. Merlis, whose full-time job is as a teacher of vocal music at Springfield Gardens High School in Queens. Mr. Merlis also runs Brooklyn Collectibles, buying and selling photographs, ephemera and other items.</p>
        <p>He has put out six books of historic photographs, through various publishers: ''Welcome Back to Brooklyn'' (1993), ''Brooklyn: The Way It Was'' (1995), ''Brooklyn's Gold Coast: The Sheepshead Bay Communities'' (1997), ''Brooklyn: The Centennial Edition'' (1998), ''Brooklyn's Park Slope: A Photographic Retrospective'' (1999) and ''Brooklyn's Bay Ridge and Fort Hamilton: A Photographic Journey'' (2000). Four of the books were written with other authors: Oscar Israelowitz for ''Welcome Back to Brooklyn,'' I. Stephen Miller and Lee A. Rosenzweig for Sheepshead Bay and Mr. Rosenzweig for Park Slope and Bay Ridge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Merlis said that he sees each book as a step forward in introducing new images to the public, rather than leaving them buried in a library or a historical society. ''So many books use the same stock photos,'' he said. ''You see them over and over again.''</p>
        <p>His books are colloquial, sometimes playful -- Mr. Merlis has no training as a historian -- and the streetscape photographs are often full of pathos and memory.  The cover of the Bay Ridge book is at first glance a straightforward 1946 photograph of the trolley tracks on Fifth Avenue in Bay Ridge. But in the margins it is full of life, recapturing a vanished and seemingly insignificant moment of time past: a woman yawns at a bus stop, a crying child yanks at his mother's hand, three men stare warily at the camera.</p>
        <p>A 1916 photograph of 10th Avenue and 69th Street in Bay Ridge features three girls, arm in arm, standing on the corner and obviously posing for the photographer, who has come to catch a much larger scene.</p>
        <p>''The photographs show that neighborhoods are organisms,'' Mr. Merlis said, ''with a constant ebb and flow of people, moving in and out.''</p>
        <p>In many cases Mr. Merlis peppers his pages with supporting ephemera: a photographic handout advertising Willie Fitzgerald's ''Lessons Given in Physical Culture'' in Fort Hamilton; a guest ticket to the Crescent Athletic Club; a season pass for the New York and Sea Beach Railway; a trade card for ''Devoe's Brilliant Oil Works.'' These connections, he said, often create ''a living directory'' of days gone by.</p>
        <p>Mr. Merlis said he is planning many more books. The next will either be images of childhood in Brooklyn, or Brooklyn in the 1940's. And he'd like to do books on Flatlands, Williamsburg, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Heights and downtown Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Dr. Joy Holland, assistant division chief of the Brooklyn Collection at the Brooklyn Public Library, said she admires Mr. Merlis's work. ''It's wonderful visual material,'' she said, ''and he has a passion -- a lot of readers use the books.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Merlis's work, however, has taken a personal toll. He is recently divorced -- he has two teenage children -- and he said that the time spent on his obsession was a major factor in the breakup. And he acknowledges that his own passion has at least once led to an action that has not helped his reputation.</p>
        <p>A recent publication from the Brooklyn borough president's office, ''Books on Brooklyn,'' compiled by the official borough historian, John Manbeck, a former professor who taught journalism at Kingsborough Community College, listed 56 books. None of Mr. Merlis's were among them. And Mr. Merlis has not been recognized in the borough president's awards for promoting Brooklyn history, 26 of which have been given in the last five years -- and which are supervised by Professor Manbeck.</p>
        <p>Professor Manbeck said that while he admired Mr. Merlis's books, ''I don't really approve of his work because he doesn't give proper credit -- he stole some material from the Kingsborough Historical Society,'' of which Professor Manbeck is the director.  Professor Manbeck said that in ''Brooklyn's Gold Coast,'' Mr. Merlis used four photographs without permission. He said that he has not pursued the matter but that he believed Mr. Merlis photographed them surreptitiously while they were on display.</p>
        <p>Mr. Merlis acknowledged that he had copied the photos from a brochure. Professor Manbeck had been on vacation when he asked to use the photographs, he said, and after he could not get help from subordinates, he just copied them. ''To get things done, sometimes you just have to do it,'' Mr. Merlis said, although he acknowledged that he should have followed the proper procedure.</p>
        <p>PART of the conflict between Professor Manbeck and Mr. Merlis may involve the frequent tension between institutions and private collectors. Professor Manbeck alluded to this problem: ''When something goes in private collections, it disappears,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the last decade Mr. Merlis has published more than 1,000 pages that have included evocative images of Brooklyn, few of them duplicated elsewhere. Professor  Manbeck said that the Kingsborough Historical Society is working on putting its material on the Internet, but ''we haven't actually published anything.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Merlis, though, publication is prime. ''I have a vast number of photos of New York and Brooklyn that have yet to see the light of day,'' he said. ''I feel this is why I was put on earth.''</p>
