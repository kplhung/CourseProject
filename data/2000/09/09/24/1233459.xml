        <p>In terms of point differential, today's loss to Ohio State was the worst defeat in Joe Paterno's 35 years as head coach of Penn State. In terms of overall record, the Nittany Lions' mark of 1-4 represents the worst start of any Penn State season since Paterno took over from Rip Engle in 1966.</p>
        <p>In terms of momentum, Paterno's players seemed to be getting worse in a 45-6 rout by Ohio State. The Buckeyes improved their record to 4-0, 1-0 in the Big Ten, while the Nittany Lions fell to 0-1 in the conference.</p>

        <p>In terms of point differential, today's loss to Ohio State was the worst defeat in Joe Paterno's 35 years as head coach of Penn State. In terms of overall record, the Nittany Lions' mark of 1-4 represents the worst start of any Penn State season since Paterno took over from Rip Engle in 1966.</p>
        <p>In terms of momentum, Paterno's players seemed to be getting worse in a 45-6 rout by Ohio State. The Buckeyes improved their record to 4-0, 1-0 in the Big Ten, while the Nittany Lions fell to 0-1 in the conference.</p>
        <p>''We've never gone through anything like this,'' Rashard Casey, Penn State's starting quarterback, said. ''When something like this happens, you sit back and ask: 'Why? Why us?' ''</p>
        <p>But records were not the greatest concerns of the Penn State personnel as everyone left a soggy Ohio Stadium. They traveled without one of their players, Adam Taliaferro, a freshman cornerback from Voorhees, N.J., who was in a hospital in serious condition suffering from temporary and partial paralysis. He was injured while trying to make a tackle in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>''It's something with the neck,'' Paterno said. ''He had no feelings. That scared the devil out of me.''</p>
        <p>Taliaferro was conscious and seemed to regain some movement in his arms before being placed on a stretcher and taken to a hospital.</p>
        <p>Shamar Finney, a Penn State linebacker, said: ''We prayed for him on the field. We prayed in the locker room.''</p>
        <p>A statement issued by the athletic department three hours after the game, said Taliaferro had a cervical spine injury with ''some neurological involvement and incomplete paralysis.'' It was too early to speculate on the severity or permanence of the injury, the statement said.</p>
        <p>The injury was an unsettling conclusion to a devastating day for the Lions, who have lost seven of their last eight regular-season games. They gave up touchdowns the first two times their defense was on the field, when the air was still filled with the thunder, lightning and hard rain that delayed the start of the game by 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>One score came on a pass that was tipped by two players, one for each team, before landing in the hands of a Buckeye, Darnell Sanders, in the end zone. The Lions gave up another touchdown to a defender, Mike Collins, on a run after a fumble recovery. They gave up four touchdowns on runs of under 10 yards. Those were scored by Jamar Martin (1 yard), Derek Combs (1 yard), Jerry Westbrooks (3 yards) and Sam Maldonado (7 yards).</p>
        <p>The touchdown on the fumble recovery came after Matt Senneca replaced Casey late in the third quarter when the score was 31-6. Senneca entered on second down, then fumbled after taking his first snap. He and Paterno had an animated discussion on the sideline afterward.</p>
        <p>''Matt was supposed to be in on the first snap,'' Paterno said. ''I was angry. He said, 'I wasn't warmed up.' ''</p>
        <p>Casey played long enough to complete 7 of 18 passes for 94 yards and an interception. Late in the second quarter, after Casey was sacked, his team called a timeout. After the break, the first snap to Casey from center Matt Schmitt was bobbled for an illegal procedure penalty.</p>
        <p>''Everybody was upbeat, ready to play, and we get out on the game field and everything goes south on us,'' Casey said. ''It's very frustrating.''</p>
        <p>When someone mentioned how the Lions missed the extra-point kick after a 2-yard touchdown run by Eric McCoo, Casey said, ''It's been like that all year so far.''</p>
        <p>Paterno's mood was a contrast with his feelings earlier in the week, when coaches and players were upbeat after brisk practices.</p>
        <p>''We can't go out and buy a bottle of medicine that's going to make everybody better,'' Paterno said. ''It's one of those years. You've got to fight your way out of it.''</p>
        <p>The 39-point margin was 1 point more than a 44-6 loss to Nebraska in 1983 and a 49-11 loss to U.C.L.A. in 1966. When asked if his team was showing improvement, Paterno said: ''In some ways, we probably are. In other ways, I think we went backward.''</p>
        <p>When pressed for answers about possible lineup changes, he said: ''These are tough days. I've got to keep my head and not go around shooting my mouth off, criticizing people and saying I'm going to do this and do that when I don't know what I'm going to do. I really don't.''</p>
