        <p>With a keen sense of her place in running history and a legendary appetite for food and success, Naoko Takahashi won the first gold medal for a Japanese woman in track and field today by setting an Olympic record in the marathon.</p>
        <p>Her compact stride suited perfectly to the difficult, undulating course, Takahashi built a lead of 28 seconds with less than a mile and a half remaining in the 26.2-mile race. Then she had to fend off a furious kick in the final quarter-mile in Olympic Stadium from Lidia Simon of Romania to win in 2 hours 23 minutes 14 seconds. Simon took the silver medal in 2:23:22, and Joyce Chepchumba of Kenya won the bronze in 2:24.45.</p>

        <p>With a keen sense of her place in running history and a legendary appetite for food and success, Naoko Takahashi won the first gold medal for a Japanese woman in track and field today by setting an Olympic record in the marathon.</p>
        <p>Her compact stride suited perfectly to the difficult, undulating course, Takahashi built a lead of 28 seconds with less than a mile and a half remaining in the 26.2-mile race. Then she had to fend off a furious kick in the final quarter-mile in Olympic Stadium from Lidia Simon of Romania to win in 2 hours 23 minutes 14 seconds. Simon took the silver medal in 2:23:22, and Joyce Chepchumba of Kenya won the bronze in 2:24.45.</p>
        <p>All three medalists finished below the previous Olympic record of 2:24:52, set by Joan Benoit Samuelson in 1984. Had this been a cooler, less humid day and had the course been flatter, Takahashi might have challenged the world record of 2:20:43, held by Tegla Loroupe of Kenya.</p>
        <p>''The way she did it, going at 19K, just blowing the field away, I think it has to be one of the greatest performances ever,'' said Chris Wardlaw, the head coach of the Australian track team. ''A 2:23 in these conditions. This course is very, very hard.''</p>
        <p>The race began in temperatures of 57 degrees, with 91 percent humidity, and the weather steadily grew hotter. These were perfect conditions for Takahashi, who has been brilliant in steamy weather. Her arms swinging lightly at her side, she drew away from Simon at about 21 1/2 miles as the course roller-coastered from uphill to downhill.</p>
        <p>''I was trying to speed the pace, and slow the pace, to shake her,'' Takahashi said of Simon.</p>
        <p>Hunched over, her wet hair plastered to her head, bothered by menstrual cramps, Simon appeared to be in trouble. However, Takahashi's legs began to grow heavy, and just before she entered the stadium, she looked over her shoulder to see Simon gaining on her.</p>
        <p>''It was hard to put my legs forward,'' Takahashi said.</p>
        <p>Revived, Simon began to sprint after Takahashi as nearly 100,000 people in the stadium realized that the outcome was still in doubt.</p>
        <p>''I thought I'd find the force to overtake her, but it was not meant to be,'' Simon said.</p>
        <p>Not until 30 meters from the finish did Takahashi finally feel confident that she would win.</p>
        <p>''This was the hardest of the five marathons that I have done,'' said the 28-year-old Takahashi, who is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 104 pounds. She became the first marathoner to win a gold medal for Japan. Sohn Kee-chung's marathon victory at the 1936 Berlin Games was credited to Japan. Sohn was actually Korean, however, and his country was occupied by Japan at the time.</p>
        <p>''I can't swallow what I've done,'' Takahashi said.</p>
        <p>Chepchumba's medal was the first won by a Kenyan woman in the marathon. Loroupe had been the favorite, but she became sick and vomited before the race. By 6.2 miles, she was already 30 seconds off the pace. She kept running and finished 13th in 2:29:45.</p>
        <p>Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia, the defending Olympic champion, struggled in the heat and finished ninth in 2:27:38. Christine Clark of Anchorage, Alaska, the lone American entry, set a personal best of 2:31:35 and crossed the line in 19th place.</p>
        <p>At 15 1/2 miles, Takahashi broke the lead pack that had once contained 20 runners down to three -- her, her teammate Ari Ichihashi and Simon -- and she was clearly intent on winning. At the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, Takahashi ran one of the most stunning marathons of all time. In temperatures that reached 82 degrees, with 90 percent humidity, she won in 2:21.47, the sixth-fastest time in history and the fastest in a women's-only race.</p>
        <p>She visited Olympic Stadium here in August and said: ''I must win the gold medal in the Olympics and set the best time in the world to etch my name in history. I want to leave proof that I existed in this era.''</p>
        <p>Since May, she had trained at high altitude in Boulder, Colo., and today she was still breathing lightly at 22 miles. ''I was able to enjoy the fruits of that practice,'' Takahashi said.</p>
        <p>After the race, she said she planned to enjoy her other passion -- eating.</p>
        <p>According to a Japanese track magazine, Takahashi can consume 40 pieces of sushi or a four-pound steak at one meal.</p>
        <p>Asked how she would celebrate her victory, Takahashi said, ''I want to eat some nice food.''</p>

        <p>Heptathlete Withdraws  SYDNEY, Australia, Sunday, Sept. 24  Reuters</p>
        <p>Eunice Barber of France, the struggling world champion, withdrew from the Olympic heptathlon today with two events remaining.</p>
        <p>Barber, short on fitness after injuring a thigh two weeks before the Games, withdrew after the fifth event, the long jump, as she slipped to 10th.</p>
        <p>Natalya Sazanovich of Belarus led over all with 4,910 points, ahead of Britain's Denise Lewis (4,853), with the javelin and the concluding 800-meter run to come later today.</p>
