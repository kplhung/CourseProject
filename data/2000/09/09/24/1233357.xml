        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Although I was grateful that you gave coverage to the 12-Step Divorce Recovery Group [''Dissolving a Suburban Marriage,'' Sept. 10], I was disappointed that the article represented our meeting and our speaker from such a depressing perspective. Our speaker shared a true story that did indeed start almost tragically but ended with spiritual growth achieved, emotional strength gained and with recovery. Is recovery not newsworthy?</p>

        <p>Although I was grateful that you gave coverage to the 12-Step Divorce Recovery Group [''Dissolving a Suburban Marriage,'' Sept. 10], I was disappointed that the article represented our meeting and our speaker from such a depressing perspective. Our speaker shared a true story that did indeed start almost tragically but ended with spiritual growth achieved, emotional strength gained and with recovery. Is recovery not newsworthy?</p>
        <p>It is important that people are made aware of no-cost resources in Westchester County during such a traumatic time, but the article provided no such information.</p>
        <p>Twelve-Step Divorce Recovery Groups meet in Mount Kisco, Shrub Oak and White Plains. Attendance is $1 per meeting. The goal is for people to gain strength and hope through the experiences of others and to create support in the new, single environment. Contact (914) 424-4522.</p>
        <p>The Coalition for Family Justice, run by Monica Getz, meets once a month in Irvington. The goal is to allow people access to volunteer attorneys, judges and other experts, free of charge. Contact (914) 591-7020.</p>
