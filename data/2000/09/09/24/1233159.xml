        <p>In ''The Irrepressible Ragman of Art'' [Aug. 27], Michael Kimmelman, writing about Robert Rauschenberg and John Cage, says Mr. Rauschenberg ''has trouble when he drifts briefly onto the subject of Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''The Irrepressible Ragman of Art'' [Aug. 27], Michael Kimmelman, writing about Robert Rauschenberg and John Cage, says Mr. Rauschenberg ''has trouble when he drifts briefly onto the subject of Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen.''</p>
        <p>''Each of them asked to visit Cage, and afterward each one denounced Cage's music,'' Mr. Kimmelman writes. ''Mr. Rauschenberg starts to weep suddenly.''</p>
        <p>In 1952, when Mr. Boulez first visited New York, Cage, whom he had got to know in Paris in 1949, not only invited him into his loft; he moved out so Mr. Boulez could move in. Still, the rift began then. It crystallized in 1957 and there was no contact for almost 20 years.</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, when I was writing a biography of Mr. Boulez, I interviewed Cage, who asked me for a favor: would I arrange a meeting between the two men?</p>
        <p>I invited them to lunch at my house. Mr. Boulez, invariably meticulously punctual, called at the last minute to say he would be 45 minutes late.</p>
        <p>Conversation covered little of substance. I recall Cage talking a great deal about mushrooms. Then, as lunch was winding down, Mr. Boulez suggested to Cage that he send him any recent score for his Prospective Encounters concert in Greenwich Village. Cage smiled but said nothing.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Boulez left, I asked Cage why he had remained silent. He had passed that time in his career, he said, when he wanted to be included in a Village concert devoted to presenting what Mr. Boulez considered ''experiments.'' Mr. Boulez, Cage added, should conduct his work himself and in the ''big house,'' i.e., Avery Fisher Hall.</p>
        <p>When I asked why he had not said that to Mr. Boulez, Cage answered, ''At college I was not good at debating.''</p>
