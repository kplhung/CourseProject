        <p>When the burly captain of the United States sailing team marched into Olympic Stadium for the opening ceremony of the Sydney Games, it was another milestone in an unlikely journey. For at the not-so-tender age of 46, Magnus Liljedahl was in many ways far removed from Goteborg, Sweden, the coastal city where he was born.</p>
        <p>Liljedahl, in his Olympic debut, is the crewman for the skipper Mark Reynolds in the double-handed Star boat, which began competition today. The fiery yin to Reynolds's laid-back yang, Liljedahl, the oldest sailor on the United States squad, charges through life like a Star running before a small gale.</p>
        <p>The rugged Liljedahl's relentless drive and upbeat attitude have served him well, for his course to Sydney traversed tragic waters. Just over a year ago, as his Olympic campaign was gathering steam, Liljedahl lost his childhood sweetheart and wife of 22 years, Agneta, who died after a four-month battle with ovarian cancer.</p>
        <p>''You grow strong from defeat and learn to accept where you are,'' he said. ''Things happen that you don't think you can handle, but you need to face them. If you don't, I guess you die yourself. So it's important to go on and always think about her and preserve her memory, and that's what I've done.''</p>
        <p>Reynolds, 44, a four-time Olympian who has won gold and silver medals in previous Games, does not try to harness his partner's emotions. Known for his cool head and his steady composure, Reynolds said: ''Magnus is probably a little more pumped up than I am, which makes for a good balance. If we were both one way or the other, that wouldn't be so great.''</p>
        <p>Balance is a key to success in the 22-foot Star, a complex keelboat with a huge sail plan that requires a big crewman to keep it flat and fast when sailing in heavy air. At 6-foot-1 and 258 pounds, Liljedahl literally fills the bill. But his contributions surpass his brawn.</p>
        <p>''Magnus really helps me tactically, especially downwind,'' Reynolds said. ''He's my set of eyes looking backward. Magnus developed the technique of standing up going downwind. So he can balance the boat like you would a windsurfer, but he also looks behind us to see the wind and the other boats.''</p>
        <p>A lifelong racing sailor, Liljedahl honed his skills in dinghies like the Finn and the Flying Dutchman before switching to the Star. He moved to Florida to pursue his sport in the early 70's. He gained his American citizenship in 1994. His Olympic dream was fostered in 1971 while attending school in Germany near the sailing site for the 1972 Munich Games. In the years that followed, he unsuccessfully pursued an Olympic berth in other classes.</p>
        <p>But when Reynolds's longtime crewman, Hal Haenel, retired, Liljedahl's dreams came to fruition. And in the last year, Reynolds and Liljedahl have been on a serious roll, besting a fleet of 111 other boats to take last spring's Star world championships shortly after winning the United States Olympic trials.</p>
        <p>Now, the Americans are favorites to win a medal in Sydney, along with Stars skippered by the Australian Colin Beashel, the Brazilian Torben Grael and the Canadian Ross MacDonald.</p>
        <p>Reynolds is approaching legendary status in the Star class, but Liljedahl said he was not intimidated when Reynolds asked him to come aboard for a Sydney campaign. ''I know Mark has succeeded before, and that makes a big difference,'' Liljedahl said. ''It's like joining a team that's won the Super Bowl. They've proven they can win; you just have to adapt to their system.''</p>
        <p>Liljedahl has since earned Reynolds's respect, as well as that of the 18-person United States sailing team, which voted him captain soon after arriving here. The honor earned Liljedahl a second-row slot with the American team as they marched into Olympic Stadium for the opening ceremony.</p>
        <p>''He was pretty excited,'' Reynolds said. ''He was showered, in his uniform and telling everybody to hurry up about two hours before we had to leave.''</p>
        <p>For a souvenir, Liljedahl had his picture taken with stars in other sports -- Marion Jones and Venus and Serena Williams. With a hint of a Scandinavian lilt still noticeable in his voice, he said: ''It was all an incredible, electrifying, goose-bumping experience. I enjoyed every minute of it.''</p>
        <p>But Liljedahl's past enables him to keep the glitter in perspective. While his plans include more sailing, he has also established a Web site (www.agneta.org) and a ballet scholarship fund for disadvantaged children in honor of his wife, a former dancer.</p>
        <p>Whatever happens on the race course this week, Liljedahl says, he knows he will remain focused on the bigger picture. ''The best guys here will win,'' he said. ''If we don't, it means we weren't the best. If that happens, I'll be disappointed but I'll get over that. Losing is not life threatening.''</p>
