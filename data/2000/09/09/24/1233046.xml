        <p>Angela Maiuri Marczewski letter disputes Lorenzo Albacete's August 27 article on grief counseling (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>As a professional counselor, I felt compelled to write after reading and rereading the article by Lorenzo Albacete (The Way We Live Now, Aug. 27). It seems to me that he has largely missed the boat on the purpose of grief counseling. Any good bereavement counselor knows that it is impossible to lessen the pain or to truly console the bereaved. The counselor simply provides a shoulder to lean on. This function (profession, if you will) developed out of the needs of a largely death- and grief-denying society, in which workers are typically allowed three days (five if the employer is generous) to grieve the death of a significant family member. After that, they are expected to ''be over it'' and to function at full capacity at their jobs.</p>
