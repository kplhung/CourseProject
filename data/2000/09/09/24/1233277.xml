        <p>This fall, 60 elderly homebound residents of the Upper East Side will receive a newfangled contraption few of them have used before: a microwave oven.</p>
        <p>The devices are being distributed by the Burden Senior Program, whose director, Marlena Vaccaro, hopes that they will significantly improve the quality of the lives of the men and women receiving them.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vaccaro got the idea for the program when she realized that many of the 110 elderly people who received daily lunch deliveries from the center's Meals on Wheels program were too frail to use conventional cooking methods. Most of them split their lunch in two, eating it cold for dinner.</p>
        <p>A pilot microwave program began in April when the Burden Center for the Aging, the parent organization of the program, provided money for 10 ovens. Ms. Vaccaro recruited graduate students in occupational therapy to determine which people would have the easiest time using the machines, in terms of things like eyesight and mobility, and trained them.</p>
        <p>Starting in November, another group of students will screen and train the newest recipients in the use of 60 new ovens ($69 apiece) financed with money from the Brick Presbyterian Church.</p>
        <p>Betty Godfrey, 78, who participated in the pilot program, placed her shiny white microwave on the kitchen counter of her second-floor walk-up in the East 70's. Ms. Godfrey suffers from severe arthritis that prevents her from standing at the stove for long periods or bending over to use the oven.</p>
        <p>The students looped an extension cord over a doorway to install the oven and taught Ms. Godfrey to use it. A diagram of the keypad in large type is nearby.</p>
        <p>''It's been great! It's been terrific!'' raved Ms. Godfrey, who enjoys explaining the finer points of microwavery, like what plates are safe to use and how to leave holes in the plastic wrap that let out steam.</p>
        <p>People who have not cooked in years will soon be able to make soup, baked potatoes, oatmeal and tea.</p>
        <p>''There was one woman who loved warm milk but couldn't stand at the stove,'' said Ms. Vaccaro. ''It's easy to make someone happy here.''</p>
