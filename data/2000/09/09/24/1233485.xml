        <p>Rep E Clay Shaw Jr, 10-term Republican incumbent from Florida's 22d Congressional district, invokes name of Rep Claude Pepper, legendary figure in South Florida and a Democrat; Frank Pepper says his brother, were he still alive, would vote for Shaw's opopnent, state Rep Elaine Bloom (S)</p>

        <p>Among the races that could be especially important in determining control of the House of Representatives is the race in Florida's 22nd Congressional District. This is the Gold Coast district, stretching from Miami Beach to Palm Beach and chock full of retirees.</p>
        <p>The race, in which state Representative Elaine Bloom, a popular Democrat, is trying to unseat the 10-term Republican incumbent, E. Clay Shaw Jr., looks to be close, with perhaps a slight edge going to Mr. Shaw.</p>

        <p>Among the races that could be especially important in determining control of the House of Representatives is the race in Florida's 22nd Congressional District. This is the Gold Coast district, stretching from Miami Beach to Palm Beach and chock full of retirees.</p>
        <p>The race, in which state Representative Elaine Bloom, a popular Democrat, is trying to unseat the 10-term Republican incumbent, E. Clay Shaw Jr., looks to be close, with perhaps a slight edge going to Mr. Shaw.</p>
        <p>But he's taking no chances.</p>
        <p>In a radio advertisement, Mr. Shaw, a moderate, boasts of how well he has looked after the concerns of his aging constituents, and he invokes the name of Representative Claude Pepper, a legend in South Florida for his watchful legislative care of the aged.</p>
        <p>Never mind that Mr. Pepper died 11 years ago.</p>
        <p>Never mind that he was a classic liberal.</p>
        <p>Never mind that he was a Democrat.</p>
        <p>The point is that Mr. Pepper cared about America's old, says Mr. Shaw, and so does he. ''I was proud to call Claude Pepper my friend'' he said.</p>
        <p>That was too much for 82-year-old Frank Pepper. He says he knew Claude Pepper, that Claude Pepper was his brother, and that Clay Shaw is no Claude Pepper.</p>
        <p>''I don't have any animosity toward Clay Shaw,'' he said. ''I've just known Elaine for years. I try to pray for Republicans. All I can. If Claude were still with us, he would be devoting himself to campaigning for Elaine Bloom.''</p>
