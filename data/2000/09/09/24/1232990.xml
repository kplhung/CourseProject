        <p>THE MINERAL PALACE</p>
        <p>By Heidi Julavits.</p>
        <p>326 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>G. P. Putnam's Sons. $23.95.</p>
        <p>MARRIED men who cheat are beginning to get on my nerves. An old friend, recently divorced, has learned that her husband was sleeping around for most of the 20-something years they'd been together. One presidential candidate is so desperate to distance himself from the Oval Office adultery scandals that he gave his wife the most showily passionate live-television kiss since Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley's at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards. And on cable television the other night, I came across that scene in ''The Women'' where Norma Shearer's screen mother explains that when men get bored they can't do something sensible like buying a hat; they have to see themselves reflected in a new woman's eyes.</p>
        <p>Now along comes Dr. Ted Jonssen, the philandering husband in Heidi Julavits's promising but erratic first novel, ''The Mineral Palace,'' and his wife barely seems to mind. ''I know you've got somebody,'' Bena tells him casually at one point. ''You've always got somebody.'' Bena considers her husband's infidelity the least of her problems. The year is 1934; the Jonssens have just moved from Rochester, Minn., to Pueblo, Colo.; and their new life leaves a good deal to be desired. The apartment they're renting is depressing. The town strikes Bena as one big dust storm constantly waiting to happen. And although Bena loves their infant son, Little Ted, she's convinced that something is horribly wrong with him. (''Nobody she knew had a child so still and so quiet.'') One day she finds the baby covered with fire ants, showing no reaction. Big Ted explains that she's just imagining things, that she's suffering from postpartum depression.</p>
        <p>Bena thinks he may be right. Her view of the world is poetically bleak, and at this point so is Julavits's prose. Whenever she attends to Bena's inner life, Julavits shines, peeling back layers of human behavior even as she's making deceptively simple observations. (''They took vows and exchanged rings, they promised to tell each other everything, but they never did tell each other much.'') Of a seemingly playful scene in a bar, she writes, ''The woman hit him, pretending to be horrified, which masked a pretending to be delighted.''</p>
        <p>These interpretations of the world -- and of Bena's relationship with her husband and child -- are at the heart of ''The Mineral Palace,'' but Julavits has, inexplicably, diminished their strength with a parade of tiresomely colorful characters and extraneous subplots.</p>
        <p>Horace Gast is the gruff owner of The Pueblo Chieftain (where Bena gets a job as an unpaid society reporter), who turns out to have a secret reason for saving Bena and Ted's lives on their way to Pikes Peak. Maude is a pregnant prostitute who moved to Pueblo to find her real father and took up her current line of work because she figured Dad would be ''the one man in town she couldn't coax into her bed.'' Red Grissom is the sexy cowboy with a mutilated hand who plays hero in a life-threatening dust storm. And then there's the local woman whose artificial leg is an elephant tusk; Bena's dead brother, Jonas; even a cameo appearance by Bonnie Parker, who bums a cigarette from Bena and tells her she never wanted children. This encounter takes place shortly before Parker and Clyde Barrow are shot dead in Louisiana.</p>
        <p>DEATH is a constant preoccupation in the novel, particularly various forms of mercy killing. Bena is told about the mountaintop where Ute Indians once left babies born with handicaps to die. Farmers shoot their starving cattle to put them out of their misery. There is a midnight infanticide.</p>
        <p>''The Mineral Palace'' may flirt foolishly with cinematic busyness and turn ridiculous now and then (yes, Bena compares one experience to seeing God), but the best parts of the novel maintain a seductive mood. When Bena observes strangers eating and drinking while pretending ''there weren't holes in their world big enough to drive a car through,'' it's clear what Julavits can do when she puts her mind to it.</p>
