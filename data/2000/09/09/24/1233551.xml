        <p>Yankees Manager Joe Torre yesterday sent his beleaguered and aching veteran, David Cone, to the bullpen for the second time this season, likely ensuring that the pitcher would stay there for the rest of his devastating 2000 season.</p>
        <p>And for the second time, Torre took Cone's old friend and former Mets teammate, Dwight Gooden, out of the bullpen and put him into the rotation. Gooden will start in Cone's place tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Torre said that Cone's left shoulder, which he dislocated Sept. 5 while diving for a bunt, was still not 100 percent, and that prompted the move. Cone has a career-low 4-13 record and 6.55 earned run average this season.</p>
        <p>''You know with Coney, it's more guts than anything else,'' Torre said. ''We're talking about enduring the pain and at this time maybe being in the bullpen is not asking him to do too much. We'll just reverse things a bit. At this juncture, we're just doing it a start at a time.''</p>
        <p>Torre said the only way Cone would make a post-season roster would be in the bullpen, but even that is not a sure thing right now. Perhaps by making a few relief appearances, Torre said, Cone could help himself.</p>
        <p>Cone arrived at Yankee Stadium at 9:45 a.m. yesterday, hoping to talk to Torre, but he did not speak with his manager until about 11 a.m. He accepted the news with professionalism, Torre said, but Cone sighed in disappointment when he discussed the demotion at his locker.</p>
        <p>''I knew all along that the chances were remote that I would get a playoff start,'' Cone said. ''I could read the writing on the wall. Any chance I would have would be in the bullpen at the end of the staff. That's just the way it is and I have to get ready for that. I have to prove I can still get hitters out. It's been a hellacious year for me. But it ain't over yet. If I can help the team in just one game, I've got to be ready to do that.''</p>
        <p>In his last outing Wednesday at Toronto, Cone was shelled for six hits and seven runs in three and two-thirds innings. It was his second start since returning from his shoulder injury, following a shaky outing against Cleveland. Gooden relieved Cone in Toronto and was impressive, allowing one earned run while striking out five in four and a third shutout innings.</p>
        <p>Cone, 37, said that while his shoulder still causes him pain and inhibits his range of motion, ''I can pitch through these things.''</p>
        <p>Then he added: ''I'm not 20 anymore. The future is now for me.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Gooden keeps reinventing himself. He has virtually locked up a postseason spot on the roster. Even he sounded surprised.</p>
        <p>''There's no way I could imagine any of this,'' said Gooden, who at 35 was released by two teams this season before coming to the Yankees in July.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, pushed for Gooden to return to New York, and the Yankees started him -- in place of Cone, who went to the bullpen for the first time -- in the first of the cross-town, day-night doubleheader against the Mets in July. Gooden thought it would be a one-shot deal.</p>
        <p>''I left my clothes in Tampa,'' he said with a laugh, and then added: ''I've been more appreciative now than even in my rookie year.''</p>
        <p>When Torre told him about tomorrow's start, Gooden immediately went to Cone.</p>
        <p>''Me personally, I wish Cone would be the guy,'' Gooden said. ''Our friendship is a lot deeper than teammates.''</p>
        <p>But Gooden has been more reliable this season, whether coming out of the bullpen for 11 relief appearances or starting four games. With the Yankees he has a 2.81 earned average and is 4-1.</p>
        <p>At this stage in his career, Gooden is thrilled with his role of utility pitcher with the Yankees. ''I don't know if I want to start again for another team,'' Gooden said. ''I've come to the conclusion where I want to end my career in New York whether it be this year or next.''</p>
        <p>Cone said he will reevaluate his future after this season, preferably after he pitches in whatever role in the postseason.</p>
        <p>''I have been throwing the ball reasonably well,'' he said. ''Obviously Joe will factor in my track record and, hopefully, that is going to help me get on the roster.''</p>
