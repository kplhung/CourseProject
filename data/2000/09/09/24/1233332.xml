      <block class="full_text">
        <p>CARL C. ICAHN has been called a lot of names in his life.</p>
        <p>Quitter usually isn't one of them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn, the billionaire financier, struggled for four years to force RJR Nabisco Holdings to split its food and tobacco units before reaching his goal in June. He worked to turn around Trans World Airlines for six years before giving up control of the carrier in a 1992 bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>''He's very determined,'' said Alfred Kingsley, who worked with Mr. Icahn for 28 years before leaving in 1993 to start his own investing firm. ''He likes to win.''</p>
        <p>So when General Motors disclosed last month that Mr. Icahn had notified the company that he might buy as much as 15 percent of its shares, it looked like the start of a potentially epic battle between Mr. Icahn and the automaker. After all, Mr. Icahn has made a career of forcing change on reluctant executives to unlock the potential of undervalued companies -- and G.M. is viewed by some analysts as the last great American corporate dinosaur. Though G.M. posted giant sales and earned $6 billion last year, the company's unexceptional cars have been losing market share in North America for decades.</p>
        <p>But last week, Mr. Icahn stunned Wall Street when he abruptly backed away from G.M. He sold his stake after buying less than $15 million in G.M. shares. He accused the company of cynically disclosing his interest in order to give its stock a short-term jolt and to make it more difficult for him to buy shares.</p>
        <p>G.M. declined to comment on Mr. Icahn's actions. But the company said that it was required to disclose his plans to its shareholders because it was buying back its own stock and it felt that news of Mr. Icahn's interest might materially affect the stock price.</p>
        <p>Only Mr. Icahn knows if he has given up on his G.M. investment or whether he will return to the company next week or next year -- and he won't say. Even when G.M. revealed his interest, he refused to say whether he planned to take a passive stake or to push G.M. to restructure -- largely by unlocking the value of its $15 billion holding in Hughes Electronics, the fast-growing satellite television provider.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Icahn's admirers say G.M. should not assume that he has gone away forever. Mr. Icahn has long since outgrown his reputation, attached to his name in print more than 200 times this year alone, as a ''corporate raider'' interested only in short-term profits, they say.</p>
        <p>To many shareholder activists, Mr. Icahn is no longer, as Fortune magazine called him last month, simply one of a group of ''buccaneers who prowled Wall Street in the 1980's, taking and gutting companies for sport and profit.'' Rather, he has become one of them, acting to catalyze corporate change. As Robert A. G. Monks, who pioneered the corporate governance movement that tries to make companies more accountable to their shareholders, says, ''He has represented a very positive force.'' (Mr. Monks's own  efforts were chronicled in a 1999 book, ''A Traitor to His Class: Robert A. G. Monks and the Battle to Change Corporate America.'')</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn reminds executives that they are ultimately responsible to their shareholders, a k a their owners, Mr. Monks said. Along the way, he added, Mr. Icahn has threatened the perks and high pay of the executives, who find it easier to call him a raider than to figure out how to make their companies more profitable.</p>
        <p>''Having been involved in trying to do much the same thing as Carl without the same skill, without the same chutzpah, without the same money, I have respect for him,'' Mr. Monks said. ''There's no question if you do what Carl and I do, you are in effect being excluded by the great and the good in our society. There isn't anybody who wants to be the director of a major company who would associate with Carl, because that would make him not clubbable.''</p>
        <p>Byron Wien, director of investment strategy at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said Mr. Icahn had become a shareholder champion almost by accident. ''Selfishness has led him to the position of being a populist folk hero,'' said Mr. Wien, who has more than three decades of experience on Wall Street. ''It sometimes happens that way.''</p>
        <p>LIKE other folk heroes, Mr. Icahn prefers to keep his story simple. He conspicuously maintains his New York accent, a relic of his roots in Queens as the son of a cantor and a schoolteacher, though he is an expert in chess and has a philosophy degree from Princeton University. ''I'm just a value player,'' he said in the first of a series of interviews this month. ''It's really as simple as that.''</p>
        <p>Or maybe not. In the heyday of leveraged buyouts in the late 1980's, Mr. Icahn was one of several takeover artists who captured the public imagination. But in recent years, most of the big names who were lumped together with Mr. Icahn a decade ago -- like Saul P. Steinberg, Ronald O. Perelman and T. Boone Pickens -- have to varying degrees fallen on hard times. Mr. Perelman's fortune has shrunk, as his flagship investment in Revlon has withered under the company's debt load. Mr. Steinberg, struggling to stay afloat, has even been sued by his mother over a $4.7 million loan that she says he has failed to repay. And Mr. Pickens has faded into obscurity since being forced out of Mesa, his natural gas company, four years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn, meanwhile, has increased his fortune fivefold since 1996, to some $5 billion, with a series of well-timed investments. He has grown his portfolio of operating companies, expanding his rail-car manufacturing business and buying casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn, who turns 65 in February, has also sorted out his personal life. In July 1999, he divorced his first wife, Liba, after a six-year separation, and married Gail Golden, his longtime assistant. Friends say he appears happier now than he did in the early 1990's, as his marriage dissolved and his investment in T.W.A. ended in the carrier's bankruptcy. ''The T.W.A. years were difficult years, both from a business perspective and a personal perspective,'' said Mark Buckstein, who served as T.W.A.'s general counsel from 1986 to 1992 and has known Mr. Icahn for three decades.</p>
        <p>Recently, Mr. Icahn, who for years has spent some of this fortune collecting Impressionist and western art, has also increased his charitable efforts, though his donations remain small compared with his multibillion-dollar fortune.</p>
        <p>BUT investing remains his primary interest. ''I enjoy making money, the scorecard,'' he said recently in his lushly appointed offices, which offer a spectacular view of Manhattan from the 47th floor of the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue. ''I like doing that, because I'm a very competitive guy.''</p>
        <p>That desire to win, coupled with a fierce intelligence, has been crucial to Mr. Icahn's success, according to both friends and adversaries. So has an unusual combination of risk-taking and caution. While other financiers have wagered their fortunes on the success of a single deal, Mr. Icahn has always been careful to diversify his bets and has never relied too heavily on borrowed money. At the same time, he is willing to buck conventional wisdom, as he did in 1999 when he shorted Internet stocks.</p>
        <p>''Most of the people who play in that game are not as well capitalized as he is and not as liquid as he is,'' said Wilbur L. Ross, whose New York investment firm specializes in taking positions in troubled companies and who has been both an ally and an adversary of Mr. Icahn over the last two decades. ''He came from a trading background, but he is willing to take a pretty long view, to be a complete contrarian, to hang in there, and ultimately more often than not to come out successfully.''</p>
        <p>Those qualities were on display in June, when Mr. Icahn more or less singlehandedly closed the book on the misbegotten $25 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, a deal that epitomized the worst of 1980's junk-bond excess. For four years, Mr. Icahn had pressed RJR Nabisco to split its food division from the tobacco business, which faces potentially huge liabilities from state and smokers' lawsuits. After several false starts, the company sold its food unit to Philip Morris for $15 billion.</p>
        <p>In the process, Mr. Icahn unlocked billions of dollars in value for shareholders -- and earned nearly $1 billion for himself buying and selling stock in RJR Nabisco and its successor companies. But the road was difficult. Nabisco shares fell almost to $8 in March after a series of court rulings against the tobacco industry. Mr. Icahn said he bought shares as the stock dropped, believing that the states, which will receive hundreds of billions of dollars from cigarette companies over the next 20 years, will not let the industry be forced into bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Flush with cash and confidence from his Nabisco victory, Mr. Icahn appeared ready for an even bolder move in August, when he told General Motors that he might buy up to 15 percent of its shares, a stake worth $5.4 billion. G.M.'s $177 billion in sales last year made it the world's largest company.</p>
        <p>But despite its size -- and its $6 billion in 1999 profits -- G.M. was a classic Icahn target, a company that looked to be sorely in need of a little tough love. Other slumbering corporate giants, like I.B.M. and Disney, reinvented themselves over the last two decades under the pressure of competition and shareholder activism.</p>
        <p>Yet eight years after the G.M. board forced out Robert C. Stempel as chief executive, the company remains troubled. G.M. now has less than 30 percent of the North American auto market, down from 45 percent in 1980, despite promises to stem the erosion in its market share. Its unions are willing and able to strike on short notice. And G.M.'s profit margin last year was just over 3 percent, barely half the company's goal of 5 percent.</p>
        <p>To be sure, G.M. has improved its profitability, thanks largely to its strength in sport utility vehicles, a cash cow. But high gasoline prices and a growing perception that S.U.V.'s can be dangerous may hurt  that franchise as well.</p>
        <p>While some independent analysts, like Ron Harbour, a consultant in Troy, Mich., who researches the productivity of G.M. and other automakers, think G.M. has turned a corner, Wall Street's contempt remains unmistakable. Despite a $10 billion cash hoard, a pension plan overfunded by $9 billion and a $15 billion Hughes stake, G.M. has a market capitalization of just $36 billion and trades at less than seven times its projected earnings for 2000. The average company in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 has a price-to-earnings ratio of about 25.</p>
        <p>Shareholders and analysts are anxious for G.M. to realize the value of its Hughes shares, either by spinning them off to G.M. investors or selling Hughes to an Internet or media company. In its defense, G.M. points out that it has already reduced its share of Hughes's stock from 70 percent to 32 percent this year and says it is actively working to find the best exit strategy for the rest of its stake. The company also notes that it has distributed $34 billion to its shareholders over the last three years in dividends, stock repurchases and spinoffs.</p>
        <p>''I have to say we're doing a lot of the right things here as a company, particularly with respect to creating and distributing value to shareholders,'' a G.M. spokeswoman, Toni Simonetti, said last week. ''Yes, we do have challenges out there in the automotive business.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Icahn, who finds deep intellectual satisfaction in hard-core value investing, G.M.'s valuable assets and weak stock make the company an almost perfect quarry.</p>
        <p>As a philosophy major at Princeton, Mr. Icahn wrote a prize-winning senior thesis on empiricism, the philosophy that theories are meaningless unless they are supported by real-world evidence.</p>
        <p>''I worked on that damn thing 12, 14 hours a day,'' Mr. Icahn said. ''I used to sit in this little carrel at Princeton and I worked through Christmas.'' He became so focused on his thesis, he said, that he grew a beard so he would not have to take the time to shave. Mr. Icahn said he made this conclusion in his thesis: ''Knowledge is based only on what you observe. You talk to me about something, you must relate it to something that's observable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn has stayed with that philosophy, searching for truth in cash-laden balance sheets and hidden assets. He is almost contemptuous of growth investors, especially those who put their faith in second-  and third-tier technology companies that have big potential but not much else. Betting against conventional wisdom, he sold many Internet companies short as they rose in 1998 and 1999, believing that their prices would eventually decline. As the stocks peaked earlier this year, Mr. Icahn had a paper loss of more than $60 million on his shorts.</p>
        <p>''It never bothered me. I wanted them to go higher,'' Mr. Icahn said of the Internet stocks. In fact, he continued to short their shares as they rose.</p>
        <p>After looking at potential future earnings for Internet companies, he said, he was certain that the stocks would never be able to earn enough money to justify their valuations. He held to that belief even as Internet stocks hit their highs early this year.</p>
        <p>Now, with many Internet stocks off 80 percent or more from their highs, Mr. Icahn said his short sales had turned highly profitable. ''On certain investments, I have an intellectual certainty where I believe very strongly in what I'm doing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That certainty extends to Mr. Icahn's personal life, said William S. Beslow, who represented Mr. Icahn's first wife, Liba, in her 1999 divorce. ''My impression during the course of the case and during the course of the negotiations is that he is enormously talented as a tactician, and extremely brilliant, and extremely rigid in articulating positions and adhering to them,'' Mr. Beslow said. ''The same characteristics that he utilized in the business area were utilized in the matrimonial.''</p>
        <p>Because Liba Icahn had signed a prenuptial agreement before marrying Carl, Mr. Icahn had a nearly airtight defense against her demands for support, Mr. Beslow said. And, Mr. Beslow added, he viewed  Mr. Icahn as basically impervious to threats of bad press. Any attempt to scare Mr. Icahn would only have angered him and made him less likely to settle the case, Mr. Beslow said.</p>
        <p>''You don't approach a Carl Icahn or a Donald Trump by suggesting that you can defeat him in battle,'' Mr. Beslow said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn said that assumption was correct. ''If he had threatened, I would have gone all the way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Instead, at a lunch on the day the trial was set to begin, Mr. Beslow appealed to Mr. Icahn's relationships with his children. ''He came to understand that modifying his position was an enlightened gesture not only for his wife, but for his children,'' Mr. Beslow said. After Mr. Icahn made that decision, he and Mr. Beslow were able to reach a settlement for Liba within 10 minutes, Mr. Beslow said.</p>
        <p>''The resolution was quintessentially Carl Icahn,'' Mr. Beslow said. ''He decided what to do, and he did it.''</p>
        <p>WHETHER Mr. Icahn could ever impose his will on General Motors is far less clear. The company's market valuation dwarfs his war chest, and G.M. can bring powerful political pressure through its unions, suppliers and dealers if it feels threatened. Nor is Mr. Icahn likely to be able to drive G.M. into the hands of another automaker. The only company powerful enough to buy out G.M. is Toyota, and Toyota is rarely interested in takeovers, analysts say.</p>
        <p>But if history is any indication, last week's skirmish may be just the first round in a long fight.</p>
