        <p>While negotiating the perilous rapids of the modern workplace, businesspeople have often turned for wisdom to venerable barbarians and connivers like Attila the Hun and Machiavelli. But all the while, it seems, trenchant job analysis, perceptive career guidance and sage financial advice have been available no farther away than the nearest child.</p>
        <p>''We are a respectable family -- one physician, one writer -- who had just moved to a new town and were meeting our new neighbors for the first time,'' recalls Diana Muir of Newton, Mass. ''One of them kindly engaged our 5-year-old daughter, Avigail, in conversation.''</p>

        <p>While negotiating the perilous rapids of the modern workplace, businesspeople have often turned for wisdom to venerable barbarians and connivers like Attila the Hun and Machiavelli. But all the while, it seems, trenchant job analysis, perceptive career guidance and sage financial advice have been available no farther away than the nearest child.</p>
        <p>''We are a respectable family -- one physician, one writer -- who had just moved to a new town and were meeting our new neighbors for the first time,'' recalls Diana Muir of Newton, Mass. ''One of them kindly engaged our 5-year-old daughter, Avigail, in conversation.''</p>
        <p>''Well,'' Avigail said, bringing all conversation to a halt, ''my daddy is a doctor and my mommy is a bookmaker.''</p>
        <p>''My daughter Kerry was always fascinated with my long career in corporate travel and events,'' writes Edward C. McManus of Marlboro, Mass. ''She was amazed that I could travel to resort areas all around the world and get paid for it, too.</p>
        <p>''I tried to explain how this career came about, but I mustn't have done a good job of it.</p>
        <p>''She told a friend, 'My father wasn't qualified to do anything, so he made up his own job and convinced people that they needed him to do it.' ''</p>
        <p>Paul Applebaum, M.D., of Newtonville, Mass., writes that he is a psychiatrist but ''not a particular stickler for etiquette.''</p>
        <p>So, he says, he was not bothered when a visiting friend of his young daughter Abby happened to call him  Mr. Applebaum instead of Dr. Applebaum.</p>
        <p>''Her parents, however, are European and of the old school when it comes to children addressing grown-ups,'' he writes. ''As soon as she realized her error, she apologized for using 'Mr.' ''</p>
        <p>Making light of an unimportant slip, he answered, ''That's all right; I've been called worse things.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Applebaum's daughter issued a prompt affirmation. ''Yes,'' she said. ''Once somebody called him a psychologist.''</p>
        <p>''I am an association management professional whose son grew up on a constant diet of committee meeting preparation, project proposals and late-night conference calls,'' says Anne McGhiey of Evanston, Ill. ''Since I was a single mother, my mantra was that we both had to share family responsibilities. We both completed household tasks, and we both had privileges. I didn't realize what my son was learning from me and what I was setting myself up for.</p>
        <p>''One day, when that long-awaited pay raise finally came and we had finished celebrating, my son Derek made his move. He sat me down at the kitchen table, highlighted his family responsibilities, repeated my mantra about sharing and speculated that if I received a 20 percent pay increase, couldn't he expect a 20 percent increase in his allowance?</p>
        <p>''After I regained my composure, I told my 8-year-old son that he could indeed expect a raise.''</p>
        <p>Four and a half years ago, when Joe Pfender of Yardley, Pa., was an unhappy employee, the simple artwork of his daughter Chelsea changed his life.</p>
        <p>''I was a middle manager for a large steamship company, working 70-plus hours a week, traveling and answering over 300 e-mails per day in the evenings and on weekends,'' he writes. ''I knew I was miserable.</p>
        <p>''However, I didn't realize the toll it was taking on my wife and three children, until one day, my 6-year-old was drawing a picture. She proudly came over to me at my laptop and showed me what she had drawn.</p>
        <p>''I asked her to point out everyone in the picture. She said: 'This is Mommy; she's cooking dinner. This is Shane; he's hitting Quinn.' I then noticed a person in the background with a blacked-in face. I said, 'Who is this?'</p>
        <p>''She responded: 'It's the back of your head. You're working on your computer.'</p>
        <p>''That comment hit me like a ton of bricks, and made me realize what my career was doing to my relationship with my wife and kids. Within a year, I had quit my job, moved us back to Yardley to be closer to family and started my own business in freight forwarding.</p>
        <p>''It hasn't been easy, but there are no long hours, no laptops and no commutes. Hopefully, simplifying my life has had a positive effect on my kids, and their memories will be of my face, not my back.''</p>
        <p>''My son, Glen, was about 32 when we got into a discussion about a salary he was then negotiating,'' writes Connie Goldstein, a writer and editor from Sarasota, Fla.</p>
        <p>''To share my wisdom, I ran down what I had been making at various stages of my career and how I negotiated my way up. When I mentioned that I was making $20,500 a year when he was a lad of 15 and I was recently divorced, he said in shocked surprise: 'Is that all you were making then? Mom, we were poor.' ''</p>
        <p>In response, she asked him: ''Well, why did you think I was always telling you not to scrape your shoes when you walked? And to take some salad and vegetables with dinner and not eat up all the meat?</p>
        <p>His reply, she said: ''Mom, I'm so embarrassed. I thought you were just cheap.''</p>
        <p>When her son was 9, Molly McCluer of Portland, Ore., was a librarian. He often teased her about the stodgy image of her profession.</p>
        <p>One day, Ms. McCluer remembers replying, ''Don't make fun of libraries; libraries have been good to you.''</p>
        <p>To which the boy shot back: ''No, Mom, libraries have been good to you. You've been good to me.''</p>
        <p>Susan Thevenet of Arlington, Va., says her younger son, John, was 7 when they happened to be discussing her work as a law librarian. Ms. Thevenet told him that payday was the best day at work.</p>
        <p>''Then why,'' he asked, ''do you bother going to work all those other days?''</p>
