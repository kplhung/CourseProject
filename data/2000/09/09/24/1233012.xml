      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Film critics were jolted last year when David Lynch, who directed a version of Barry Gifford's novel ''Wild at Heart,'' released ''The Straight Story,'' a G-rated road movie with a fuzzy sheath of atypical sentiment. Now it's Gifford's turn to surprise: his new novel, WYOMING (Arcade, $19.95), is a tender and understated story that has none of the gleeful sadism or frenzied grotesqueries that have defined his earlier work. Not all of Gifford's trademarks have disappeared: The narrative is elliptical, the dialogue zigzags and Gifford's preoccupation with highway-bound drifters stands front and center. But instead of the dissipated losers and bug-eyed maniacs who've peopled Gifford's previous novels, the drifters here are a sweetly indulgent single mother and her young son, Roy; their travels through 1950's America are the novel's backbone. Just where they're headed, or why, is rarely revealed, but that's not the point, as even young Roy understands: ''Maybe sometimes it's better to imagine how something or someplace is rather than to have it or be there.'' For this pair, Wyoming is just such an imaginary place, a dream locale where Roy and his mother can always escape. ''It's really big there, with lots of room to run,'' Roy says. ''I looked on a map. Wyoming's probably a good place to have a dog.'' When anything bad happens, Roy tells her he's going to ''think about Wyoming.'' ''It's a good thing, baby,'' she replies. ''Everybody needs Wyoming.'' That Gifford forges these characters almost entirely out of dialogue makes their affecting humanity doubly impressive; by the novel's end, Roy and his mother are likely to live as vividly in the reader's mind as their unseen Wyoming lives in theirs.</p>
