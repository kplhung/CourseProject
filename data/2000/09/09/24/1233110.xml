        <p>ALONE for her first holiday since she got divorced, Jan Krivosheiw, a psychotherapist from Syosset, decided to volunteer. ''Lonely on Thanksgiving?'' read the ad she inserted in a local paper inviting other singles to join her in spreading holiday cheer at Timothy Hill Children's Ranch, an orphanage in Riverhead.</p>
        <p>Six singles responded to her call that November 12 years ago. At Christmas that year, she placed another ad. Twenty-five singles joined her for a sing-along at the United Presbyterian Residence in Woodbury followed by a potluck dinner at her home. What's next, the volunteers wanted to know. Soon Dr. Krivosheiw had 50 helpers planting trees on the beach with Operation Xmas Tree with the Town of Oyster Bay.  ''Every time I put out an ad and thought of another event, more people showed up,'' said Dr. Krivosheiw, 54. ''I realized I had an organization on my hands.''</p>
        <p>The group she founded, Singles for Charities, now has a mailing list of 1,500 names, a newsletter listing dozens of volunteer opportunities, monthly meetings followed by dances and hundreds of not-for-profit benefits, concerts, galas sporting events, animal rescue missions and environmental projects  to select from each year. Most of the singles are 45 and over.</p>
        <p>''They are newly single, newly widowed and they are not there to check people out,'' Dr. Krivosheiw said. ''It's not a singles event, but they meet the other singles. We attract very giving singles rather than takers. You get hooked on this stuff and it's really contagious.''</p>
        <p>As she talked, she was selling raffle tickets at the 12th annual Crab Fest at Centerport Beach, sponsored by the Suffolk County chapter of the American Red Cross. Dawn Tropeano, an administrator with the chapter, said the all-you-can-eat picnic for 800 was the group's largest fund-raiser and would have been difficult to run without the Dr. Krivosheiw's 25 volunteers.</p>
        <p>''The Singles for Charities are one of my main sources,'' Ms. Tropeano said. ''They are an awfully big part of it. They are helpful and organized and they take control of the situation. They handle my raffles, they serve the food, they greet the guests. Their clowns entertain the kids.''</p>
        <p>Some of the singles helped out at the Friends of the Arts outdoor concert series at Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay  and the Harry Chapin 5K Run/Walk this summer. Others volunteered at the Documented Beach Clean-Up Day, sponsored by the Littoral Society at Jones Beach on Sept. 16. And Dr. Krivosheiw, who donates time at about 30 functions a year, is looking forward to volunteering at United Cerebral Palsy's Festival of Trees at SUNY-Old Westbury Nov. 24 through 26. The singles help set up, work the gift shops and decorate three trees. Singles for Charities' own benefit, a garage and yard sale, is today at 291 Jackson Avenue in Syosset from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>While most of the women had previously done community service, as P.T.A. moms and Brownie leaders, volunteering was an option many of the men had never considered. ''Once they got hooked on it, they really like it,'' said Dr. Krivosheiw. ''Single people, a lot of whom who have been divorced or even widowed, often feel misplaced, yet don't want to be in a singles organization. They want to do something that looks productive. Whatever happens beyond that is a bonus.''</p>
        <p>Several marriages, and babies, have been born out of the group. Some of the couples continue to pitch in together at various benefits. And it's not all work. The volunteers also meet for bowling, tennis, hikes and weekend outings.</p>
        <p>After her divorce, Maddy Corr, a bookkeeper and real estate agent from Wantagh, tried the club scene. She hated it. When she joined Singles for Charities, she said, she found a whole group of friends.</p>
        <p>''They are honest people,'' Ms. Corr said, having found that many men she met at bars were looking to party, not to have a long-term relationship. ''If you go to something like this, you network and meet other nice people. It's very fulfilling.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Dr. Krivosheiw decided to start a clown group with some of her cancer patients. Realizing it might also give singles a boost, she hired professional clowns to give lessons and teach makeup.</p>
        <p>Since then Clowns for Charity has been providing entertainment for children and the elderly at many of the not-for-profit affairs. After Dr. Krivosheiw's 78-year-old mother, Leonora DeGaglia, helped sew the costumes, she joined the group as head clown. A longtime widow, Ms. DeGaglia figured it was neither too late to meet someone new or to do good for others.</p>
        <p>The clown group was an instant success. So there was Stu Rosenberg, a medical technician from Wantagh, dressed as Patches the Clown, blowing and forming balloon animals for the children -- and grown-ups -- waiting in line for food at the Crab Fest. ''I don't do the singles places,'' said Mr. Rosenberg, a lifelong bachelor. ''This just fits in. I like helping people. It makes you feel good. You get little kids to smile.''</p>
        <p>After being widowed for the second time in nine years, Anita Arrigio of Plainview joined the singles group. ''My lifestyle changed,'' Ms. Arrigio said. ''I had just started to socialize at that point. I had to keep busy and I liked the idea that we were helping organizations who didn't have enough of their own personnel.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Arrigio said being involved helped ease her mind. While she has made a lot of friends, she is not sure that volunteering in a black and white clown suit with pink lipstick hearts drawn on her cheeks is the path to finding true love. ''I think the best way is to be introduced,'' she said. Not hedging her bets, she goes dancing and to other singles events.</p>
        <p>When she first got divorced 11 years ago after 25 years of marriage, Rosemary Pappacoda, a teacher's aide at Suffolk Boces from Bay Shore, just stayed home. She tried singles dances but didn't enjoy them. ''When I went to Singles for Charities, it was more like a family,'' she said. ''You see the same people. At a bar, you never see them again.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Pappacoda, who has three grown children, said she has dated several men she has met while volunteering, but isn't ready for a mate. ''It fills my time and fulfills my sense of being with people I really like,'' she said. ''They are all in the same boat. No matter where I volunteer, I'm always with someone. The kids are great, but they want to know you have your own friends. It's building my own life and that's what I want.''</p>
        <p>Barbara Perretta, a programmer analyst from Huntington Station who has never been married, said the volunteer program worked because participants weren't limited to one organization and could commit as much time as they want. ''If you're single and not dating anyone, you have a lot of time on your hands to be working with other people rather than staying home alone,'' Ms. Perretta said. ''And it's a great service for the community.''</p>
        <p>Dennis Vogel, a production planner for an electronics company from Setauket, was working the food line at the picnic, dishing out roasted and barbecued chicken.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I accomplished something today,'' said Mr. Vogel, who is divorced. ''It's a worthy cause. It's a way to meet people, have good food and enjoy the day.''</p>
        <p>Lamenting the Suffolk County singles scene, he added: ''There are less and less places you can go to meet people. This is one of the places you can go to. I don't do the clubs much anymore. I'm getting tired of it. This is a much better alternative. It gives me fulfillment.''</p>
        <p>Were it not for the singles group, Mr. Vogel said he would never have considered going to the Crab Fest because, like many fund-raisers and community events, it was a family-oriented activity. ''We brought our own crowd,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Last year, Dr. Krivosheiw's son happened to be free on Thanksgiving. She took him along to the Ronald McDonald House in New Hyde Park on a Singles for Charity jaunt to help cook food. ''He loved it,'' she said. ''I actually look forward to Thanksgiving now. It's a wonderful opportunity.''</p>
