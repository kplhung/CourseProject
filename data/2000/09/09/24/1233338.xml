        <p>First Al Gore planted a big one on his wife, Tipper, at the Democratic Convention, and the pollsters said it worked wonders with women. So after Oprah Winfrey jokingly complained that Mr. Gore failed to kiss her in a cheery appearance on her talk show, Mr. Bush delivered a strategic smooch to her cheek last week and declared that his favorite gift to his wife, Laura, was a kiss.</p>
        <p>What's going on?</p>
        <p>''We've spilled our guts on everything,'' said the author and television personality Barbara Howar. ''We may as well show our tonsils.''</p>
        <p>Who's to blame? As with so much in American politics, Bill Clinton is the leading suspect. For two terms, Mr. Clinton has made his family's domestic turmoil successful grist for the political mill, from his mother's battles with his alcoholic stepfather to his own quest for spiritual renewal after an adulterous affair. He and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were also accused of cynically allowing photographers to capture them dancing in bathing suits just weeks before word of Mr. Clinton's affair with a White House intern became public.</p>
        <p>So the attention to this year's crop of kisses has everything to do with last year's loves. However sincere or spontaneous the Gores' embrace (which lasted from four to seven seconds, depending on how much of the hug is counted), it seemed to stand in stark contrast to Mr. Clinton's marital complications. Ditto Mr. Bush's endorsement of spousal smacking.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we'll have a pucker-ometer here pretty soon that will help us gauge our candidates,'' said Dayton Duncan, who was press secretary to Michael S. Dukakis during his 1988 presidential campaign. Mr. Duncan seems to find it all a bit mystifying. ''In my high school, in Indianola, Iowa, the people who were known as good kissers, everybody knew who they were,'' he said. ''And sometimes that was good, and sometimes that was bad.''</p>
