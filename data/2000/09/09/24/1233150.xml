        <p>To the Editor: I have long awaited the time when travel writers would find the rugged beauty of the Basilicata region as the last of ''undiscovered'' Italy, and read with pleasure ''Basilicata, Rock Hard and Still Untamed,'' by Frederika Randall (Sept. 3). It is an area I have visited many times, as my parents migrated from there in 1930.</p>
        <p>In addition to the places Ms. Randall mentioned, the traveler may enjoy visiting several of the picturesque hilltop towns near Matera.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: I have long awaited the time when travel writers would find the rugged beauty of the Basilicata region as the last of ''undiscovered'' Italy, and read with pleasure ''Basilicata, Rock Hard and Still Untamed,'' by Frederika Randall (Sept. 3). It is an area I have visited many times, as my parents migrated from there in 1930.</p>
        <p>In addition to the places Ms. Randall mentioned, the traveler may enjoy visiting several of the picturesque hilltop towns near Matera.</p>
        <p>One of these, Montescaglioso, is an ancient town perched precariously on a peak that juts up from the valley of the Bradano River. The town has  arched medieval narrow streets lined with whitewashed houses and a spacious piazza, where people congregate to chat and hold political rallies and festivals.</p>
        <p>A traveler arriving in mid-August would find baroque decorative lights lining the main streets and piazzas, and processions following an elaborate float that carries the statue of St. Rocco, patron saint of the town, who saved the population from the plague.</p>
        <p>Of major interest is the Abbey of St. Michael the Archangel, built by the Benedictines in the 11th century. It is an architectural treasure whose splendor has remained intact despite modifications made over the centuries.</p>
        <p>I'll be going there when I accompany my 91-year-old mother to attend the wedding of her niece.</p>
