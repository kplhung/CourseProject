        <p>When times are hard, people tell stories. Heads huddled on the sleeping porch, at the barber shop, around the kitchen table, they spin tall tales about the panther that chased a woman and her baby in a buckboard, the tornado that swept up Old Man Chandler in his outhouse, the Goat Man who snatches children who try to cross the Swinging Bridge -- wondrous yarns like the ones in THE BOTTOMS (Mysterious Press/Warner, $24.95), a pungent period mystery by Joe R. Lansdale that draws on the idiom of regional folk legend to filter the horror of race violence and serial murder in a small East Texas town during the Depression.</p>
        <p>The aged narrator, Harry Collins, is lying in a rest home and letting his mind drift back to the events that changed his life in 1933. Picking up the story in his own voice, the 11-year-old Harry shares his innocent wonder at the wild woods, his childish openness to neighbors black and white, and his terror when he and his little sister find the mangled body of a black prostitute in the deep bottom lands along the Sabine River. Harry's father, the town barber and constable, does his best; but when the killer claims a white victim, he can't stop his Klan neighbors from lynching an old black man for the crimes. In this tale of dark enchantment, it falls to Harry to find the truth behind the legend, to look beneath the skin to learn the secret ways of grown-ups -- and to share his bitter lessons with us all.</p>

        <p>Like the briny waterfront saloons in Fells Point and the neon Domino sugar sign at Locust Point, Laura Lippman's Baltimore mysteries used to be a strictly local attraction, appealing on a very personal level to the quirky mentality of a city smart enough not to take itself too seriously. Although Lippman stays within the city limits for her first hardcover novel, the oddball Baltimore sensibility in THE SUGAR HOUSE (Morrow, $24) has a gritty charm that should travel outside her hometown.</p>
        <p>Tess Monaghan, the scrappy private eye who gives this series its blue-collar credentials, has the native skill of negotiating favors for friends. Tess thinks she's doing a favor for her father, a city liquor board inspector, when she agrees to get the dirty details on his waitress girlfriend's son, a glue-sniffing teenager who was killed in prison. But first she has to identify the Jane Doe whose death got him put away for manslaughter. The investigation leads Tess on a tense journey from inner-city neighborhoods to a creepy sanitarium on the Eastern Shore where rich men's daughters are treated for eating disorders and eventually to the political heart of power in Annapolis. Although Lippman gives every neighborhood a distinct, almost foreign personality, Tess seems instantly at home wherever she goes.</p>
        <p>At first, I attributed the extreme brutality of Jean-Christophe Grange's BLOOD-RED RIVERS (Harvill/Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25) to an overheated translation (by Ian Monk) from the French. I was wrong. This intelligent but twisted policier is harrowing from the inside out.</p>
        <p>Pierre Niemans, a Parisian police superintendent given to ''uncontrollable fits of violence,'' is hustled out of town after he comes close to killing a murderous hooligan in a soccer riot. No one got to a young lieutenant named Karim Abdouf in time. An Arab foundling who grew up hard on the streets of Nanterre, Abdouf viciously settles an old score his first day in uniform. When this combustible duo meet on assignment in the French Alps, the byplay is dynamite -- as is the cliffhanger ending, which unites them in a final face-off with a vengeful killer.</p>
        <p>In the more analytic part of the story that precedes the fireworks, Grange charts the separate investigative routes that direct these unorthodox cops to Guernon, a small university town where some sadistic killer is displaying the mutilated bodies of his victims high atop a glacier cliff. Abdouf, who has a brilliant mind, takes a scientific approach to certain suggestive genetic clues, while the abrasive Niemans, who mistrusts all intellectuals, dives into deep emotional waters. Chacun  son got.</p>
        <p>The characters in Stuart M. Kaminsky's police procedurals are such down-to-earth people that even a Russian scientist orbiting the planet on the space station Mir comes across as a lowly wage slave in a routine, thankless job. In FALL OF A COSMONAUT (Mysterious Press/Warner, $24.95), Tsimion Vladovka, ''a botanist with no great ambition,'' has been toiling away for eight months on the decrepit Mir (which reminds him of the overburdened little horse that haunted Raskolnikov's dreams in ''Crime and Punishment'') when some unspecified but clearly extraordinary event takes place. Since the appealing Vladovka disappears early in the story and the remaining astronauts fail to make much of an impression before someone starts assassinating them, the burden of being human falls to Kaminsky's philosopher-policeman, Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov, and his Moscow investigators, who shoulder the duty with the resignation and humor that do them -- and this enduring series -- honor.</p>
        <p>Readers who have been following the daring adventures of Caroline Fremont Jones as a private detective in early-20th-century San Francisco have also been waiting for this unconventional young woman's return to her native Boston, from which restrictive precincts she fled for the freedom and promise of the West. When her father falls ill in BEACON STREET MOURNING (Doubleday, $22.95), the sixth book in Dianne Day's smart series, Fremont (as this assertive feminist prefers to be called) finally makes that journey home and finds both the city and her family greatly changed -- although no more profoundly than Fremont herself after the suspicious death of her father and the murder of her stepmother. The only disappointment to this slim but smoothly plotted domestic mystery is that, given its personal nature, Fremont is much too despondent to appreciate the ornate glories of Boston that Day unfolds like a rich carpet at her feet.</p>
