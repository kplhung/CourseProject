        <p>APROSYS COMPUTER, a tiny business above the Amir Barber Shop on West 181st Street in Washington Heights, is easy to miss in this neighborhood where beauty salons and discount stores with bins of $10 jeans are more common than computer shops.</p>
        <p>That is changing.</p>
        <p>In the last two years, five computer-related businesses have appeared in the area bordered by Broadway, Amsterdam Avenue and 179th and 186th Streets, providing tangible proof of how technology is weaving itself into the local fabric.</p>
        <p>''The computer is becoming just another household utensil, like a television or a blender,'' said Alex Rodriguez, a technician at another new computer business, Compus Electronics Center, a repair shop on West 179th Street wedged between a bodega and an auto parts shop.</p>
        <p>A year ago, Compus mostly repaired two-way radios for livery-cab drivers. Noting how many local residents were buying computers, the owner, Justo Peguero, decided to offer computer repairs.</p>
        <p>''When I saw his store, I just went in,'' said Jose Reynoso, a recent customer. ''I liked being able to get repairs done in the neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>The growing local demand in part reflects a wider trend. Despite worries that minorities are on the wrong side of the digital divide, Forrester Research, which reports on technology issues, says low-income Hispanics of any race or ethnicity are more likely to be online than low-income whites nationwide.</p>
        <p>Local computer businesses still have a long way to go before they take over the market from downtown or suburban superstores. At Mr. Peguero's store, computer repairs rank a distant second to the two-way radio business.</p>
        <p>Even the oldest store, six-year-old Castle Computer, on Broadway and 192nd Street, sells only about 10 computers a month and focuses on repairs, upgrades and training. There is also a Radio Shack, on 181st Street, between Broadway and Bennett Avenue, which sells some computers as part of its electronics business.</p>
        <p>But the growing interest in computers has encouraged entrepreneurs with a distinct neighborhood flavor in this heavily Dominican area. Their businesses are often family owned and unmistakably Latino. Marketing is generally by word of mouth, fliers passed out in the street and advertising on local Spanish-language cable.</p>
        <p>The hours can be unpredictable, although it is a pretty sure bet that the doors at Aprosys will close by noon on Sundays so Hector Marmolejos, the owner, can get to his weekly softball game.</p>
        <p>At Aprosys, which moved from the Bronx 20 months ago, Mr. Marmolejos specializes in systems design, mostly for local Hispanic-owned businesses, while his son handles hardware sales and repairs.</p>
        <p>A few blocks away, on St. Nicholas Avenue, a white sign with red block letters hangs from the awning of Taveras Beauty Supply with a simple message: ''Computer.'' Down a narrow stairway is the 18-month-old Computer Multi-Service Center, a bare-bones operation whose main attraction is a narrow laboratory with a dozen PC's where classes are held in the evenings.</p>
        <p>The business is run by Genis Guzman and his wife, Maribel, who lived in Washington Heights for 11 years before recently moving to New Jersey. Manuel Feliz, was sent by his employer, a local money-wiring service, to take two introductory lessons. He ended up paying for three more months of Word and Excel lessons and also bought a printer.</p>
        <p>''Everything is computers,'' he said. ''If you're not trained in Excel, Powerpoint, you're not prepared. Everything I do here I apply at work.''</p>
        <p>Raul Aquino leads the classes in an animated Spanglish.</p>
        <p>''Tenemos aqui el menu bar, y aqui el standard tool bar,'' he explained to an introductory class as a merengue by the Latin Grammy winner Juan Luis Guerra played in the  background.</p>
        <p>On a recent evening, Alfonso Guerrero, 41, a security guard, was leaving the center after an Excel class when Ms. Guzman yelled out to him, ''When are you buying the computer?''</p>
        <p>''Not yet,'' Mr. Guerrero replied sheepishly. ''I don't have the money.''</p>
        <p>When he does, he said, he will probably buy the machine there.</p>
        <p>''They have a good payment plan,'' he said. ''They give you up to a year to pay.''</p>
        <p>Edward Atristain owns Channel PC, which has a full storefront on Broadway. Mr. Atristain has been selling and servicing computers in Jackson Heights, Queens, since 1993. He opened the Washington Heights branch of his store seven months ago. His customers include two community groups, the Dominican Women's Caucus and the Community Association of Progressive Dominicans.</p>
        <p>''I would prefer to do business with someone who is local and small,'' said David Sang, the association's fiscal officer, explaining why he used Channel PC.</p>
        <p>Mr. Atristain has stocked his shelves with educational software and set up online terminals for customers to rent in 20-minute blocks. He hopes to attract people like Rene Marte, a 27-year-old music promoter who recently waited for hours at the local public library to check his e-mail after his father took the family laptop with him on a trip to the Dominican Republic.</p>
        <p>The fifth new business was started eight months ago, by Hector Anderson, a Pentecostal minister. When his Spanish-language Christian bookstore, Fuente de Vida, was going through tough times, he began selling used PC's from a back room, calling the secondary business Antel Computer.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Anderson's lease had a clause restricting sales to religious items. The solution: install a free CD-ROM bible in each computer. But that is one service no longer available in Washington Heights. A property tax dispute forced him to move both businesses to the Bronx in August.</p>
        <p>The remaining stores are counting on drawing local residents with convenient and familiar settings. The prices won't hurt, either. Luis Madrigal is commissioning a computerized management system for Madrigal Executive Transportation, a new car service, from Aprosys.</p>
        <p>''If I went downtown, it would cost me 50 times more than it's costing me here,'' Mr. Madrigal said.</p>
        <p>''Seriously,'' he said, only half-seriously. ''I'm not exaggerating.''</p>
