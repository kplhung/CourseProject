        <p>THE images might be considered unearthly and, indeed, that is the theme of the exhibit: ''Heaven and Hell: Images of Sin and Salvation.''</p>
        <p>But the photographs on display at Art on Main Street/Yonkers are very much a part of the world. In the arts center's second annual photography exhibit, 20 Westchester phographers share their visions of the sacred and transcendental as well as scenes of suffering and discord.</p>
        <p>The show's curator, Luis Perelman, chose 60 photos, both in color and in black and white. They include these images, clockwise from top left: ''Once There Were Jews Here'' by Karin Meyers; ''Untitled'' by Arnold Kastenbaum; and three images by Eugenia Ames, ''The Covered Car,'' ''The Abandoned Building'' and ''The White Pony.''</p>
        <p>An artists' reception is scheduled Oct. 6 from 5 to 8 p.m. The exhibit continues through Dec. 15 at the gallery, 149 Main Street, Yonkers. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 1 to 3 p.m. Telephone: (914) 423-4366.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 8, 2000, Sunday  A picture caption on Sept. 24 about an exhibition at Art on Main Street/ Yonkers included an erroneous credit from the gallery for a photograph of a gated entranceway. The photographer was Susan Parslow, not Arnold Kastenbaum.</p>
