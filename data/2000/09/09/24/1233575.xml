        <p>Chris Terreri has been the ideal backup to Martin Brodeur the last six years. The Devils wanted to make sure he would be for at least another season by getting him back from the Wild after Minnesota selected him in the expansion draft over the summer.</p>
        <p>After two weeks of training camp and five preseason games, however, Terreri is in a battle with Frederic Henry for the backup role. Henry has looked sharp in training camp and in three preseason appearances, but Terreri's stock took a huge jump in tonight's 4-2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers at Continental Arena.</p>

        <p>Chris Terreri has been the ideal backup to Martin Brodeur the last six years. The Devils wanted to make sure he would be for at least another season by getting him back from the Wild after Minnesota selected him in the expansion draft over the summer.</p>
        <p>After two weeks of training camp and five preseason games, however, Terreri is in a battle with Frederic Henry for the backup role. Henry has looked sharp in training camp and in three preseason appearances, but Terreri's stock took a huge jump in tonight's 4-2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>Alexander Mogilny led the Devils with three goals, scoring in each period. Terreri shut out the Flyers, stopping all 10 shots he faced in 30 minutes 25 seconds of action before he was replaced by Brodeur.</p>
        <p>Brodeur stopped 11 shots but gave up Philadelphia's two goals, both short-handed. None of Terreri's saves were spectacular, but he played solidly and displayed confidence in distributing the puck.</p>
        <p>Terreri, who will turn 36 next month, had a 2-9 record last season and played poorly. He looked average in his three previous preseason appearances, allowing six goals in 106 minutes. Henry, 23, who played with the Albany River Rats of the American Hockey League last season, allowed three goals in 78 minutes in the three games he played.</p>
