        <p>And here are some responses from , a New York Times online knowledge network, to Lynn Hirschberg's article on the new generation of black comedians.</p>
        <p>I guess black comedians have always been popular, ever since people of color were chained and dragged over here hundreds of years ago. It's an old survival technique. Keep 'em laughing and they won't kill you.</p>

        <p>Chris Tucker says, ''I haven't experienced racism.'' What planet does he come from? The fact that he attended a school where he was allowed to fail -- apparently was encouraged to fail -- was an act of racism.</p>

        <p>Well, Chris is a great actor. And if he has no sense of race, then so be it.</p>

        <p>I used to roar with laughter watching ''Amos and Andy'' on TV in the 50's. Of course, I also laughed at ''I Love Lucy.'' Some would say that I, being white, was laughing at Kingfish, while I laughed with Lucy. A goof is a goof, whether a black man or a zany redhead. And frankly, I can't see the difference.</p>

        <p>Comedy is comedy whether it's black or white.</p>
