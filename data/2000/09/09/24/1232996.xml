        <p>JELIZA-ROSE is 11. Her father is an elderly rockabilly star, her mother a former groupie: both parents are heroin addicts, and when mother OD's and dies, father gathers up his little girl and takes her from Los Angeles to an isolated farmhouse in Texas. Soon after they arrive, he, too, OD's and dies. We are on Page 43 of Mitch Cullin's third novel, ''Tideland''; for the rest of the book Jeliza-Rose will wander aimlessly around the house and grounds, chatting with her favorite Barbie doll head -- Classique by name -- and trying to ignore her father's dead body. In time she'll make friends with a boy named Dickens, who's every bit as strange as she is. The result is a disaster from which no one learns anything about anything.</p>
        <p>Sheriff Branches is the lawman in King County, Tex., but he's hardly more capable of moral reasoning than Jeliza-Rose. When his book -- Cullin's second novel, ''Branches'' -- begins, he's standing on the edge of his property, listening to the cries of his stepson from the bottom of an abandoned well. While he listens he reflects on the pass that brought them there: an epidemic of poisoned dogs, his theories of law enforcement, his hatreds and those of the boy.</p>
        <p>These are two books by Cullin published within months of each other. Compare and contrast.</p>
        <p>To begin with, ''Tideland'' is prose, and ''Branches'' is prose disguised as verse: briskly narrative, colloquial and for the most part lacking either overt meter or consistent rhyme. One book takes place in central Texas, the other in the Panhandle, landscapes as different from each other as one state can hold. There are intimations of Carson McCullers in ''Tideland,'' of Michael Ondaatje's ''Collected Works of Billy the Kid'' in ''Branches.''</p>
        <p>But they're similar enough in tone and attitude. Both books flirt with a kind of hard-boiled/gothic hyperbole: dead bodies, sex and violence, a world growing more appalling by the page. In ''Tideland,'' little Jeliza-Rose applies makeup to her dead father's face, to correct for the discoloration caused by his decomposition. In ''Branches,'' the sheriff murders Mexicans according to his own perverse principles, rapes one woman and one man, and commits sundry other crimes. Excess like that always runs the risk of being slightly ridiculous, but Cullin avoids crossing the line into cliche -- well, mostly he avoids it -- by reining in his writing. Simile is kept at a minimum, and the characters never stoop to reflecting upon their circumstances with bloated profundity. Instead, everything is rendered in the most matter-of-fact tones, very plain.</p>
        <p>The prose is a stage set for Cullin's ventriloquism, which is brilliant and beautiful: His 11-year-old wild child is identifiably such, with just enough sophistication in her voice and vocabulary to keep her from being too nave to be interesting. His middle-aged cop rambles through his noirish cantos and never utters a false-sounding phrase. Absent any real plots, both ''Tideland'' and ''Branches'' are suspended on their narrators' voices, which are story enough in themselves, rhythmic and telling as they recount the details of their days. ''Careful. Almost done,'' Jeliza-Rose says as she applies makeup in the empty house. ''Deadly lips as delicious as an apple. Dream Date Jeliza-Rose doll. When the lipstick reached the nooks of my mouth I had to pause; it was hard getting the scarlet neatly in the corners.'' ''I knew this boy / that made his mother laugh,'' Sheriff Branches says. ''Should've never bought him / that 9mm. / Should've bought him / a dog instead.'' You turn the pages just to keep them talking.</p>
        <p>And if the talking gets them nowhere, it comes as considerable relief: a little misplaced sentimentality and both books would be worth much less. But they're a pair of small, hard pieces, like stones that you find in the bottom of your pockets -- which turn out to be gems, after all, albeit strangely faceted and a little bit dirty.</p>
