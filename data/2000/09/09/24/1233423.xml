        <p>The attire ranged from athletic-coach casual to the flowing-skirts-with-hiking-boots look, with an occasional beret and silk scarf sighted. Grandmothers and pierced eyebrows were in equal abundance. There were blind poets with guide dogs, slouching young poets with infants asleep on their breasts, and everywhere, under almost every tree, someone writing in a hard-bound notebook -- poets in their natural habitat.</p>
        <p>From as far away as Hawaii, thousands of people came to the Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival here, which began on Thursday and runs through Sunday, to hear some of the nation's and world's better-known poets.</p>
        <p>The festival, nicknamed Wordstock by its fans, was expected to attract 15,000 people to Waterloo Village, a restored colonial enclave in Sussex County complete with a canal, a gristmill, and a temporary Borders bookstore.</p>
        <p>Throughout the weekend, Yusef Komunyakaa, Mark Doty, Lucille Clifton, Chinua Achebe and Stanley Kunitz, among others, were scheduled to read.</p>
        <p>''I've never been anywhere where there are so many happy people in one place for so many days,'' said Betty Lies, a poet from Princeton who works with the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, the festival's sponsor. ''People are happy, relaxed, and high on poetry. It's not a frantic high, it's kind of a mellow high.''</p>
        <p>Under a circus tent, where mourning doves destined to appear in someone's volume of Personal Reflections in the near future flew through two at a time, capacity crowds of about 2,400 gathered to hear Stanley Kunitz, 95, the national poet laureate, and Gwendolyn Brooks, who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1950.</p>
        <p>The festival, an every-other-year gathering since 1986, is known for attracting poets who, like their work, are accessible. James Haba, the festival director, has brought together writers from a variety of disciplines and cultures.</p>
        <p>''I try to invite people who are really interested in a living audience, who are not afraid to encounter that audience, and who think there is some value to being in a room with people and giving their words directly, at the moment,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In an afternoon discussion about teaching poetry, Billy Collins, who has published six books, poked fun at the academy's infatuation with obscure poems. ''It can't be good if it's clear,'' he said. ''I think we still have that masochism, in a way -- we need to see a certain level of difficulty before we recognize it as literature.''</p>
        <p>As evidenced by the abundant yucks under the big top during his reading, Mr. Collins draws people into his work by making them laugh.</p>
        <p>Heather McHugh, a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets, displayed her trademark wordplay in her reading, sharing her favorite anagrams (the letters of Dylan Thomas's name, for example, can be rearranged into ''hot lady's man,''  ''Russian poetry'' can be transformed into ''syrup into ears,'' and ''English poetry'' turns into ''nightly repose.'')</p>
        <p>After explaining her love for the counties of Pennsylvania, she read a poem about a would-be seduction that ended, ''It was just for Lackawanna that I didn't take him home,'' then ended with a harrowing piece defining poetry as what could not be said by the martyr who was burned alive in an iron mask that kept him from speaking.</p>
        <p>It used to be that writing poetry was something one owned up to sheepishly -- an eccentric, somewhat suspect hobby, like a predilection for collecting Mason jars. But, after facing an audience of 2,400 eager listeners, the poet Edward Hirsch, author of ''How to Read a Poem and Fall in Love with Poetry'' (Harcourt Brace, 1999), felt a quicker pulse in the art form.</p>
        <p>''If there were something like this in every state, the state of American poetry would be completely changed,'' he said. ''It's so powerful. People come with so many questions about poetry. The enthusiasm about it is tremendous.''</p>
        <p>For Sander Zulauf, a poet who teaches at the County College of Morris and edits The Journal of New Jersey Poets, the festival serves as a family reunion.</p>
        <p>''We see each other so rarely, because we work alone,'' he said. ''I just love the extraordinary poets, their responsibility to language and their responsibility to humanity.''</p>
        <p>Andrea Wesol, an English major at Brown University who had driven from her campus in Providence, R.I., is used to listening carefully at poetry readings, but enjoyed this weekend's opportunities for interactions with writers.</p>
        <p>''It's just great to be at a place where poetry is celebrated and emphasized,'' she said. ''You can be waiting in line for a hamburger, talking about Lucille Clifton.''</p>
        <p>The Dodge Foundation, based in Morristown, has chosen poetry and the teaching of it as priorities. The foundation invited high school students and teachers to the festival free on Thursday, when 6,500 people attended. Friday was devoted to teachers at all levels, with 3,000 people showing up, twice as many as in 1998.</p>
