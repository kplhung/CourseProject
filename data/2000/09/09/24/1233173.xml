        <p>The Pythians' Sanctum</p>
        <p>Q.: Today I passed the apartment building at 135 West 70th Street and noticed a peculiar inscription on the cornerstone, which reads ''To Pythianism, 1926.'' What does it mean?</p>
        <p>A.: The Pythian Temple, as the perplexing neo-Egyptian structure was once called, was designed by the architect Thomas W. Lamb and built in 1927 to serve as a clubhouse for the Order of Knights of Pythias, a fraternal organization founded in Washington during the Civil War. The building contained several stacks of lodge halls and meeting rooms suspended above a columnless auditorium.  Much of its original terra cotta decoration, including two 10-foot seated pharaohs, is still in place.</p>

        <p>The Pythians' Sanctum</p>
        <p>Q.: Today I passed the apartment building at 135 West 70th Street and noticed a peculiar inscription on the cornerstone, which reads ''To Pythianism, 1926.'' What does it mean?</p>
        <p>A.: The Pythian Temple, as the perplexing neo-Egyptian structure was once called, was designed by the architect Thomas W. Lamb and built in 1927 to serve as a clubhouse for the Order of Knights of Pythias, a fraternal organization founded in Washington during the Civil War. The building contained several stacks of lodge halls and meeting rooms suspended above a columnless auditorium.  Much of its original terra cotta decoration, including two 10-foot seated pharaohs, is still in place.</p>
        <p>In their own terms, the Knights of Pythias ''seek to take hold of the hearts of men in a never-ending quest for international brotherhood.'' The group takes its name from the tale of Damon and Pythias, initiates in the Pythagorean mysteries in Syracuse in the fourth century B.C., during the reign of the tyrant Dionysius. When Damon was sentenced to death, Pythias took his place so Damon could say farewell to his family in Greece. Damon returned at the hour of execution, and Dionysius, stirred by the strength of their friendship, set both men free.</p>
        <p>Though the knights are nonsectarian, members are required to profess faith in a supreme being, and the Bible has long been the centerpiece of much of the group's ceremonial activity. In fact, the Pythian Temple,  which the A.I.A. Guide to New York City has called an ''opium-smoker's dream,'' was built virtually without windows, the better to guard the privacy of the group's secret rites. The building, which was later used for many years as a branch of Manhattan Community College, was finally fenestrated during a 1982 renovation,  to turn it into the Pythian Condominiums.</p>
        <p>Cartooning 101</p>
        <p>Q.: Leafing through some old newspaper articles, I came upon a reference to a School for Cartoonists and Illustrators, located here in New York City. Does such a school exist? If not, what became of it?</p>
        <p>A.: The School of Visual Arts opened under that name in 1947, with a faculty consisting almost entirely of working artists, art directors, photographers and designers. Located at 209 East 23rd Street, the school did not take its current name until 1956, when it added programs in art history and the humanities and expanded its vocational curriculum.</p>
        <p>In 1986, it became one of the first to offer a master of fine arts degree in computer arts, and is among the nation's largest independent fine arts schools. Cartooning graduates include Bill Gallo of The Daily News and Patrick McDonnell (''Mutts'').</p>
        <p>New Lighting for George</p>
        <p>Q.: Was it my imagination, or was the George Washington Bridge illuminated differently on the evening of Sept. 4?</p>
        <p>A.: The Port Authority has been experimenting with a new $2.5 million lighting scheme for the bridge, and on July 4 and Sept. 4 the towers were illuminated for the first time since the city was host to the World's Fair in 1964. The necklace lighting that adorns the cables is to remain in place, but 375 new 150- and 1,000-watt metal halide light fixtures have been installed inside both of the bridge's lacy steel towers. ''It's similar to the way the Eiffel Tower is lit,'' said Steven Coleman, a Port Authority spokesman. ''The lights are pointed upward so that they don't shine onto the surrounding areas.''</p>
        <p>No date has been set for the debut of the new scheme, and it has not been decided when, or how frequently, the towers will be illuminated, Mr. Coleman said. If they are lighted every night, it will cost $73,000 a year, or $200 a night. ''Perhaps we'll just light them on holidays,'' he said.</p>
