        <p>DANNY PARADISE -- yogi, minstrel, world citizen -- has no phone number, no post office box, no residence he calls home. He roams the planet with a bag or two, leaving luggage under beds in his wake. The only way to reach him directly is through a carefully guarded e-mail address. ''People generally get to me by contacting someone who already knows me, and when I'm in their area, I'll call that person to say I've arrived,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In other words, Mr. Paradise is just the sort of centered, enlightened, elusive personality that celebrities flock to, making him a yoga darling of the music and fashion sets.</p>
        <p>Not that he'd want you to know this.</p>
        <p>''I don't like to put myself out there,'' Mr. Paradise said recently, voice modulated, posture perfect, as he sat amid Asian artifacts in a friend's Central Park West aerie. A ribbon of incense wafted out an open window in a futile attempt to rub out the aroma of cigarette smoke. (Not his.)</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, Mr. Paradise arrived in, and quickly departed from, the city that never sleeps, ostensibly to talk about the culmination of a dream: the release this week of his first CD, ''River of the Soul,'' featuring music inspired by a lifetime of ruminations.</p>
        <p>Still, imagined or not, it was hard to overlook the coincidence between his visit and Sting's concert in Central Park. (He was there.) Or Paul Simon's appearance at the Democratic fund-raiser at Radio City Music Hall. (He was there, too.)</p>
        <p>Especially since both rock icons, as well as Mr. Simon's wife, the singer Edie Brickell, a host of musicians from both their bands and two of Nepal's most famous indigenous ensembles, Prastar and Karma, can be heard on ''River of the Soul'' alongside Mr. Paradise, who performs vocals, acoustic guitar and the odd flute or harmonica.</p>
        <p>While singing with Sting, Mr. Paradise sounds, well, a bit like Sting. When singing with Mr. Simon, he sounds, uh, a lot like Mr. Simon. (No small wonder since Mr. Paradise  cut his musical teeth on Simon and Garfunkel in the 1960's.)</p>
        <p>On his own, ''it's Neil Young'' -- pause -- ''meets Windham Hill'' was how one listener, a mechanical engineer, described him.</p>
        <p>For now, the work will be filed in record stores under ''New Age,'' Mr. Paradise said, adding, ''They don't know what to do with it.''</p>
        <p>At least Donna Karan does. In her own contribution to her friend's career, the designer has committed to putting the CD in her stores, as well as its soon-to-be-released companion video of location shots filmed by Mr. Paradise and his girlfriend, Michi Holley.</p>
        <p>But however star-studded his client roster may be -- a news release for the album names Madonna, Eddie Vedder, Mickey Hart and Bob Weir as Mr. Paradise's students -- he prefers to remain, Zelig-like, in the frame but comfortably removed from the camera's gaze. He has granted only one other interview in his 25-year career, for a yoga book published in Sweden, in Swedish, a language he hoped might not be widely read.</p>
        <p>He is soft-spoken, articulate and thoughtful, and his laid-back look belies an encyclopedic knowledge of things spiritual and physiological and a disarming, razor-sharp wit.</p>
        <p>He is also, however pleasantly cloaked, a journalist's nightmare, and he knows it, delicately establishing parameters on such topics as his name (''Can't you just say that I would neither confirm nor deny whether I changed it?'') and the virtues of tantric sex as spoken of in the past by Sting (''I'm not sure that really belongs in this article. Let's just say he was a good student'').</p>
        <p>Halfway through the interview, he began to look uncomfortable. ''Would you mind mentioning how we met?'' he asked. ''I don't want people to think I sought you out.''</p>
        <p>Indeed.</p>
        <p>For the record, this writer met Mr. Paradise through cousins living in Bangkok, who met him through friends living in Phuket, an island off Thailand, where he was teaching (most of his teaching, he insists, is done in public classes). Even with what he called an ''organic connection,'' it still took Mr. Paradise nearly three years to agree to an interview.</p>
        <p>This much he'll reveal: He is 48 and was reared in Toronto, where as a teenager he played football and baseball, studied martial arts and worked as a swimming instructor.</p>
        <p>After a year at a university, he met a man who described traveling across India and Asia, following a route taken by spiritual seekers. Intrigued, Mr. Paradise quit school and set out himself, on foot. By 21, he was making an annual pilgrimage from Canada to Hawaii to Asia.</p>
        <p>It was on a layover in Hawaii that he noticed a sign for a yoga demonstration given by David Williams, a grandfather of Ashtanga yoga in the West, and his wife at the time, Nancy Gilgoff. Urged by a girlfriend, Mr. Paradise went.</p>
        <p>''I saw this guy who was amazing, very advanced, doing things no one had seen,'' he recalled of the physically rigorous system that involves synchronizing the breath with a progressive series of increasingly complicated postures. ''The moment I did it, I recognized this as something Westerners had never experienced before. It was much, much deeper.''</p>
        <p>Each year, he would stop in Hawaii and learn another of the system's six sequences. Halfway into the series, at age 23, Mr. Paradise began to work for Mr. Williams as an apprentice teacher whenever he was on the islands.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he made a little money by writing music and playing his guitar in clubs. In 1983 Dominic Miller, an English guitarist, dropped by a London bar where Mr. Paradise was performing and struck up a conversation. Soon, he, too, became a yoga convert.</p>
        <p>By 1987 Mr. Miller had joined Sting's band. Three years later, Mr. Paradise dropped by the studio where Sting was recording his ''Soul Cages'' album.</p>
        <p>''Danny asked if I wanted to do yoga, and I thought yoga was sitting around contemplating my navel,'' Sting said in a telephone interview from his home outside London. ''But he had these amazing photographs, and I was intrigued. And I thought, I'm in great shape. Let me have a go at that.''</p>
        <p>Soon, he was crowing a different tune. ''I couldn't do a thing,'' he said, laughing. After about 20 minutes of yoga, Sting was exhausted. ''So I invited him to my home,'' he continued, ''and he stayed with me for about three months. I haven't missed a day since.''</p>
        <p>Fast-forward two years, when Sting called up Mr. Simon and Ms. Brickell to ask if they'd like to meet his yoga teacher.</p>
        <p>''I was shaking my head, 'No, no, no,' '' Ms. Brickell recalled. ''But Paul invited Danny over and we took a lesson.''</p>
        <p>''I loved it and I wanted to do it as often as I could, because I imagined it as something you could do your whole life,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Sting also turned Madonna on to Mr. Paradise, who says he gave her her first yoga lesson.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon, Ms. Brickell and Mr. Paradise became good friends, occasionally performing music together. By now, in yet another class, Mr. Paradise had also encountered Richard Foos, a co-owner of Rhino Records. He passed along a tape of his work, and Mr. Foos eventually got it to Mesa/Bluemoon Recordings. A contract was signed.</p>
        <p>''He got this record deal and asked if we would sing with him,'' Ms. Brickell said. ''And we said sure, because we like his music and it would be great giving back to Danny, especially when you love someone as much as we do him.''</p>
        <p>Sting had this to say of the wandering yogi he considers a close friend: ''Danny's had this dream since I met him, to make a record of his works. In order to do that, you have to stop flitting around the world with your guitar, and tie yourself to a stake and set fire to it. Lo and behold, 10 years later it has happened, and we're all rooting for him.''</p>
        <p>Whether or not Mr. Paradise's stature as a musician will surpass his celebrity as a yogi remains to be seen. But he's not sweating it.</p>
        <p>''I only hope these songs inspire people,'' he said modestly, when asked about his expectations for his CD and video. ''I'm looking to turn them on to new and ancient ways of looking at things, to show them the beauty of diverse cultures. That's all.''</p>
        <p>''Yoga is the science of religion,'' he added, ''and the definition of religion that I like to use is moving with great speed into inquiry. It asks four questions: Am I happy in what I'm doing? Is what I'm doing adding to the confusion on Earth? What am I doing to create peace and contentment in my life? How will I be remembered when I die?''</p>
        <p>He paused. ''Can you make sure you mention the great generosity of Paul and Sting?'' he asked. ''I am indebted to them.''</p>
        <p>Wish granted.</p>
