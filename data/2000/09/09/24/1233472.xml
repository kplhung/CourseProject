        <p>After 10 years in power, President Alberto Fujimori of Peru faced his most serious challenge, but after several days of uncertainty appeared to have beaten back the threat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori announced new elections and the dissolution of the national intelligence service after a damaging bribery episode came to light. His spy chief, implicated in the scandal, dropped from sight, and opposition groups called for Mr. Fujimori's immediate resignation. On Thursday, a statement of support from the armed forces solidified his position even if it left the price extracted by the military and the fate of the intelligence boss unclear.</p>
