        <p>When the invited guests had finished boarding the gleaming new train, sitting on a custom-built test track high above green fields growing thick with rice, a uniformed young stewardess passed through, handing out refreshments and bowing.</p>
        <p>So far, all seemed familiar to train passengers in Japan, down to the Chiclet-shaped windows and the feel of the seats. Then the train began to move. In 90 seconds flat, without even a shudder, the latest wonder of Japan's train developers blurred the landscape, reaching 270 miles an hour as the director of the test program unleashed a wicked grin.</p>
        <p>Many of Japan's ''bullet train'' lines, already among the world's fastest, have been losing money for years.</p>
        <p>And yet money seemed like an annoying afterthought in a demonstration that made it clear that this nation's eager railroad developers are determined to push a new generation of ultra-high-technology trains  able to travel almost twice as fast as today's best.</p>
        <p>''There are a variety of ways to consider the costs of a train,'' said the test director, Hiroshi Suruga, who shifted uncomfortably as a reporter sought to change the subject back to nitty-gritty questions of development spending and operating costs and away from magnetic levitation. That exotic technology propels the train through a combination of expensive components cooled by liquid helium and super-high voltage.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Suruga's answer resembled a fudge, it was one all too familiar to the growing chorus of critics of Japan's huge government-sponsored projects.</p>
        <p>Duplicate space programs spend billions of dollars and yet are unable to successfully launch rockets; extraordinary bridges lead to sparsely populated islands.</p>
        <p>As a result, Japan is the world's most indebted country, with public debt recently estimated at 130 percent of the gross national product.</p>
        <p>Once, the Japanese public might have watched all this with resignation. But the new train, the maglev (for magnetic levitation), may turn out to be the latest in a recent string of dubious projects that have raised the hackles of increasingly wary taxpayers.</p>
        <p>''People in the countryside often support these kinds of projects because they need jobs to survive in these hard times, and it must be pointed out that our political system is heavily skewed in favor of rural voters,'' said Akio Ogawa, a professor of policy studies at Chuo University in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>''But urban residents have completely lost their faith in this kind of project. For them it is just runaway fantasy, and it has been going on for 30 years or 40 years now. There is no reason for this project to ever come to fruition. It is too expensive, and we already have a budgetary crisis in Japan.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ogawa, who has emerged as an influential writer on wasteful public spending, said the government had carefully concealed the costs of the next generation train project so as to help forestall opposition.</p>
        <p>''The government says it is merely experimenting, and they have no idea of the total cost,'' he said. ''But we know it is already astronomical, and ballooning.''</p>
        <p>With a bit of prodding, Mr. Sugura, the head of testing for the train, said  the maglev had cost about $3 billion to develop -- a figure that almost certainly omitted a multitude of hidden subsidies -- and would require about three times as much energy to run as the country's existing bullet trains.</p>
        <p>''Whether a project is successful or not as business depends on how much passengers can pay and the subsidies that government and municipalities give to the project,'' said Naoto Egawa, a Ministry of Transportation official.</p>
        <p>''If such subsidies cover 100 percent of its capital, the transport fee could be set low because it only has to cover things like personnel expenses and electricity. Whether subsidies should be granted to the project or not is decided by the people, through elections.''</p>
        <p>Critics say that answers like this inadvertently, but accurately, spotlight the crisis of governance that underlies the runaway spending.</p>
        <p>Rather than build a test range for the new train in an area of relatively flat, open spaces, the 25-mile track was built in this heavily mountainous farmland west of Tokyo, requiring a huge span of elevated concrete, a truss bridge and numerous long tunnels. This has meant huge contracts for construction companies and jobs.</p>
        <p>And the local government of Yamanashi put up close to $200 million to subsidize the test center to ensure that as big a piece of the action as possible came to this prefecture of 895,000 people.</p>
        <p>''Because of the huge place of construction in our economy, new public works are always needed to keep things going, and the maglev is part of this scheme,'' said Takehiko Hobo, a professor of public finance at Shimane University.</p>
        <p>''In the United States you have the military-industrial complex. In Japan we have the bond between political and business leaders, especially in construction. And it is believed that 3 percent of the value of all public works comes back to the politicians in the form of political donations.''</p>
        <p>But in the ultimate sign that this system is in crisis, even the local residents who could once be counted on to support spending on big public works have begun calling the projects into question. This year, for example, residents of Tokushima Prefecture stunned the government by voting in a referendum to reject a large dam-building project.</p>
        <p>And in an ominous foretaste of what lies ahead for planners should they decide to introduce a magnetic levitation train from Tokyo to Osaka, residents of the very Yamanashi Prefecture where the project's test phase was held have begun to lodge protests against it.</p>
        <p>''Ten years ago only the Communist Party would have opposed a project like this,'' said Keiji Kato, a member of a local Yamanashi residents' group that opposes the construction.</p>
        <p>''Now there are company heads, lawyers, housewives, accountants and students here against it. The only people who stand to profit are a handful of construction companies and landowners, and not the general population. We must save our money for other needs.''</p>
