        <p>As Gov. George W. Bush today devoted a second day to stumping in a state where he never expected fierce competition, Republicans have begun to second-guess the Bush campaign, saying it took Florida for granted, failed to explain Mr. Bush's position on issues of concern to the many elderly people here and, over all, neglected signs of Vice President Al Gore's potential to win.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Gore has drawn even or overtaken Mr. Bush in other crucial states, the governor's advisers say they are most unnerved by the upended electoral reality in Florida, which has 25 electoral votes, making it one of the biggest prizes on Election Day. And now with only six weeks remaining, Republicans face polls showing a dead heat in Florida.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to construct a strategy for Mr. Bush to capture the White House if he does not win New York, California or Florida, and polls show Mr. Gore is comfortably ahead in the first two states.</p>
        <p>But instead of moving aggressively over the summer to secure Florida, Republican lawmakers and party officials in and out of the state said in interviews this week, the Bush forces seemed lulled into complacency here. The assumption of many Bush advisers, these Republicans said, was that Mr. Bush would not have to worry about Florida because his brother Jeb is the popular governor, and because Florida historically backs Republicans for president.</p>
        <p>''Everyone was coasting with an easy smile and the thrill of victory in their mind,'' said Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida. ''The stakes are very high now for Jeb. You don't want your own brother calling and saying, 'What happened? I thought we were in pretty good shape?' ''</p>
        <p>Besides costing campaign time for Mr. Bush, the miscalculation has forced Republicans to divert millions of dollars here to the fourth largest state -- money that would have been pumped into battleground states in the Midwest, where he also faces a powerful threat from Mr. Gore. A secondary yet significant concern among many Republicans is that the tight race here complicates the party's drive to win the state's open Senate seat, as well as its prospects in two ferociously competitive House races.</p>
        <p>Even as Republicans assess their own performance, they also credit the changed dynamic to demographic factors and to the Gore campaign's deftness at sensing Mr. Bush's vulnerability. One after another, Republicans said Democrats had more skillfully tailored their issues to Florida voters.</p>
        <p>Many Republicans said an incalculable benefit for their opponents was Mr. Gore's selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate. In picking the first Jewish candidate for a major party presidential ticket, Mr. Gore emboldened Jewish voters, even though most were widely expected to favor Democrats anyway.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because they were so optimistic, many Republicans now grouse that Mr. Bush and his party did not move early enough to advertise in Florida.</p>
        <p>They also say the campaign was slow to explain Mr. Bush's stands on issues that are critical to the aging population here, from prescription drugs to protecting Medicare and Social Security.</p>
        <p>They noted that Jeb Bush warned his brother months ago that Mr. Gore could effectively scare elderly voters -- and that those warnings never seemed to be acted upon. ''We should have been off the block a bit earlier on our senior citizen issues,'' said Tom Slade, a former chairman of the State Republican Party.</p>
        <p>But many Republicans said Jeb Bush had disappointed them as well because he had not stumped as visibly, and doggedly, for his brother as they had expected. He has been a potent fund-raiser for the party but has been far less active publicly for the ticket than many other Republican governors. Concerns about Jeb Bush's commitment intensified earlier this month when he did not show up at a rally here with his brother, prompting the Texas governor to crack, ''I'm a little disappointed the chairman of my campaign is late.''</p>
        <p>Seeking to explain Jeb Bush's low profile, Al Cardenas, the state Republican chairman, said the Florida governor had retreated because he did not like being compared to his brother in the press. ''Another reason is he's got a lot of things to do,'' Mr. Cardenas said. ''But he'll do more.''</p>
        <p>At a fund-raising event in Coconut Grove near here on Friday night, it appeared that Jeb Bush got the message. The Florida governor played an important role in organizing what appeared to be a wildly successful event; thousands of partisans mobbed a convention center to hear George W. and Jeb Bush and see their families.</p>
        <p>''Florida is Bush country!'' Jeb Bush exulted. His father won the state in 1988 and 1992, but President Clinton carried it four years ago.</p>
        <p>George W. implored the crowd: ''We're going to win Florida. We're going to win. Let's redouble our efforts. Let's talk to those Democrats who want new leadership. Let's get those independent voters.''</p>
        <p>The close competition has led the nominees to travel here several times since their conventions. Mr. Bush was in Orlando today, on the second day of a two-day swing. His father, former President George Bush, was here on Friday. Mr. Gore arrives on Monday; Mr. Lieberman, was in Florida on Thursday and Friday.</p>
        <p>Even when the principals are not here, their messages are front and center in a relentless barrage of commercials in virtually every major media market.</p>
        <p>Republicans take some solace in the belief that voters of Florida could turn on Mr. Gore just as they have on Mr. Bush. They also said the unanticipated strength of the Democratic ticket might shake Republicans out of their complacency.</p>
        <p>''People are reading polls and saying, 'It's over,' '' said Al Austin, a Tampa real estate developer who is the finance chairman of the State Republican Party. ''Well, it's not over. If Gore wants to cause George W. to spend time in Florida and keep him out of the battleground states, I'm sure that's part of their strategy. But at the same time, they've motivated the Republicans.''</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Bush carries Florida, the Gore campaign can claim something of a victory, because the Bush camp and the Republican Party have spent more than $4 million in advertisements here since the Democratic convention. The money could have been spent on Midwest campaigning.</p>
        <p>Representative Joe Scarborough,  Republican of Florida, said the only comparable situation he could think of would be one in which Republicans  spent heavily in California -- a state that has been in the Democratic column -- and forced Democrats to divert money into that state. That has not happened.</p>
        <p>''It's about as bad of a scenario as Democrats having to spend a lot of money in California,'' he said. ''It's something that you don't budget in.''  Mr. Scarborough still expects Mr. Bush to prevail in Florida. If he does not, the congressman said, ''It would have a devastating impact on the Senate race and the two House races in play -- just devastating.''</p>
        <p>The time to be worried, Mr. Scarborough said, is next month -- if Mr. Bush is still traveling to Florida. ''He just can't afford to be in Florida in October,'' Mr. Scarborough said.</p>
        <p>Some Republicans said the Bush organization's excessive confidence and less than enthusiastic operation in Florida reminded them of how Mr. Bush and his top advisers were brimming with certainty about their prospects on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, in which Senator John McCain upset Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The fierce competition here was perhaps inevitable, given changes in the voting population. In recent years, there has been an influx of young, suburban families, many of whose members are independent voters with no partisan allegiances.</p>
        <p>Another factor is that second-generation Cuban-Americans, long reliable Republicans, do not seem as resolutely committed to the party, in part because they are not as fiercely guided by their sentiments against Fidel Castro. Yet another opportunity for Democrats has been that the pool of Cuban-American voters has been stagnant, while there has been a surge in Hispanics from Central America and elsewhere, who would be more likely to vote Democratic.</p>
        <p>''The idea that Florida was a Republican state was never a correct interpretation,'' said Senator Bob Graham of Florida, a Democrat whose failure to be picked as Mr. Gore's running mate signaled to some Republicans that the Democrats were not serious about winning the state.</p>
        <p>While officials of the Gore campaign have said for months that they intended to compete in Florida, they conceded that some of their early threats were intended to keep the Republicans off balance. Campaign officials said there was considerable debate over the decision to spend a half-million dollars on television commercials in three markets in the state this summer. Even now, the campaign is grudging in its spending here; it has spent just over $1 million for advertisements since the Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>Tad Devine, one of Mr. Gore's top strategists, said the campaign decided to step up its advertising when polls after the Democratic convention found that Mr. Gore had pulled even with Mr. Bush in Florida.</p>
        <p>Mr. Devine said he was stunned that the Republicans did not run commercials in the state earlier to strengthen Mr. Bush's support. Had the governor maintained his lead, Mr. Devine said, the Gore campaign would not have decided to compete strongly in Florida.</p>
        <p>''If we were sitting there looking at a 15-point disadvantage,'' he said, ''we would have faced a completely different set of circumstances.''</p>
