        <p>WHEN you already have a Piaget watch and a Montblanc pen and are casting around for a new handmade emblem of arrival in the good life, think of Edward Barder in his brick-and-shingle workshop here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barder makes the fishing rods that anglers with impeccable taste -- and deep pockets -- simply must have.</p>
        <p>He makes them to order from aged Chinese bamboo, in a traditional style that long predates the mass production of carbon-fiber or fiberglass rods that anyone can use nowadays. And he sells them at prices of $1,680 for a two-piece rod ($2,240 for a three-piece; line and reel, of course, are extra) to customers whose eyes glint at the rods' alchemy of silk and varnish, cork and cane.</p>
        <p>At three to four times what even the top-of-the-line carbon fiber rods fetch in the United States, the price may seem excessive. But in the rarefied world of split-cane rods, built from six triangular strips of bamboo to form a rod with a hexagonal cross section, Mr. Barder's are not alone.</p>
        <p>In New York, for instance, some fishing tackle stores advertise similar rods made by the R. L. Winston Rod Company, an American manufacturer, for $2,100 to $2,550. Another United States company, Thomas &amp; Thomas Rodmakers, sells split-cane freshwater rods for $1,100 to $1,850. Split-cane rods made by Mario Wojnicki for the Scott Fly Rod Company run to $3,500.</p>
        <p>Somewhat more modest prices for cane rods are found in Britain, from $430 at C. Farlow &amp; Company to $1,400 at Hardy Brothers. Another independent maker, Ian Martin of Durham in northeastern England, sells his rods for around $850. And there is a strong trade in secondhand cane rods: Stephen J. Fawcett, a Lancaster tackle dealer,  advertises old Hardy Brothers rods for up to $700, and antique rods can fetch prices as handsome as their silk whippings and varnished sheen.</p>
        <p>From his modest premises near the confluence of two trout streams, the Lambourn and the Kennet, Mr. Barder, 35, is tapping a market built partly on nostalgia for handmade products and partly on the cachet of a rod that anglers associate with the languorous chalk streams of southern England. He knows that it is a niche market: last year, Mr. Barder said, he produced just 67 rods, and his waiting list now stretches to six to nine months.</p>
        <p>''There's no serious attempt at getting some terrific output going,'' he said. ''If we try to make more rods, we run the risk of saturating the market, and one would sacrifice quality for quantity.''</p>
        <p>Turning out one rod every three and a half working days, on average, will not earn a fortune for him or his sole employee, Colin Whitehouse. Total rod sales were about $116,000 last year, and the customers expect their rods to come with pampering touches like silk bags and handmade leather tubes to enclose them. ''This is something you do for love, not money,'' Mr. Barder said.</p>
        <p>Though this country often sees itself as the cradle of angling (Izaak Walton's ''Compleat Angler'' was first published in Britain in 1653), the most significant innovation in the history of fine cane rods is usually ascribed to Americans like Solon Phillippe, who is said to have made the first hexagonal rods in the mid-1800's, in Pennsylvania. And in a brief treatise on the subject in his catalog, Mr. Barder writes that ''the American responsible for taking the split-cane rod to its ultimate conclusion, that is, a precision-built, all-hexagonal rod with waterproof ferrules, a fine action and a modest weight, was Hiram Lewis Leonard.''</p>
        <p>In 1921, G.E.M. Skues, one of Britain's most famous fishermen and a legend in the arcane world of catching trout with artificial flies, called his Leonard-made rod the best in the world, spurring British makers like Hardy Brothers to produce rods ''comparable to today's best,'' according to Mr. Barder's treatise.</p>
        <p>TECHNOLOGICAL advances in hollow fiberglass over the years -- and in carbon fiber rods in the 1970's and 80's -- seduced many British anglers away from what came to be regarded as the clunkier, less powerful and less accurate cane rods.</p>
        <p>Many have stayed away. Despite the cachet of the deluxe handmade versions, a spokesman for Farlow's fishing store in London's Pall Mall said there was ''no great upsurge'' in sales of cane rods generally. And Hardy's, a sister store nearby, expects to sell just 10 or 12 cane rods a year.</p>
        <p>In the United States, by contrast, there is a much bigger following for split-cane rods -- both those from manufacturers and from scores of craftsmen and small businesses. ''The U.S. market is the toughest to crack because they are so partisan about their own rod makers,'' Mr. Barder said.</p>
        <p>In a modest way, Mr. Barder sought to breach the wall last year by making a special millennium rod to be presented by the Flyfishers Club of London to the Anglers' Club of New York. John Larkin, president of the New York club, pronounced the Barder rod ''splendid'' after catching fish with it on England's River Itchen.</p>
        <p>Why do the cane rods appeal to well-heeled anglers? Some say the style of fishing associated with the rod, with its languid casts of curling fly-line, draws them back to a product made of natural materials and away from the whippier, less-forgiving modern carbon-fiber versions. It is a style associated, too, with the elite fishing grounds of southern England, where the rights to cast in the streams springing from chalk aquifers are usually controlled by syndicates that charge steeply for the privilege. A day's fishing on the River Test in Hampshire can cost $350 or more. So why not do it in style?</p>
        <p>Others say that for certain types of angling, the split-cane rod is simply more efficient. And in the United States, split-cane rods are regarded as part of a purist approach to fly-fishing -- a sport that attracts its share of purists.</p>
        <p>But, as with many other objects of desire, from fine Swiss watches and fountain pens to vintage cars, the appeal of a Barder rod may lie in the knowledge that a skilled person made it carefully and to order.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Barder's shop, it takes 40 to 60 hours of work, sometimes stretching over 12 to 16 weeks, to make a typical rod -- a two-piece, 8 1/2-foot-long split-cane trout version weighing just four ounces. Mr. Barder starts with Chinese bamboo tubes, some of them 35 years old. Then comes the delicate job of cutting thin strips, straightening them and planing them into tapered triangles with tolerances of less than one-thousandth of an inch. Six are selected to be glued together into what he calls ''the perfect hexagon.'' The resulting blank rod must then be fitted with rings bound with silk, a cork handle and a reel mounting made of polished olive wood.</p>
        <p>THE finished product may be as good for catching the eye as for catching fish.</p>
        <p>''People move up the career ladder, they have a bit of money and they want to spoil themselves with something handmade from natural materials, with a nice bag and a leather case,'' said Mr. Barder, who began his rod-making career by repairing a broken rod as a teenager. ''It's a bit of an ego boost.''</p>
