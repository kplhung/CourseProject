        <p>ASK anyone to name the progenitors of hip-hop, and the name William Shakespeare isn't likely to spring to mind. But that may change on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater, where the choreographer and director Rennie Harris will unmask the Bard of Avon as a hip-hop M.C. steeped in street jive and well-versed in gang warfare and gangsta psychology.</p>
        <p>The occasion is the New York premiere of ''Rome and Jewels,'' a ''hip-hop opera,'' as Mr. Harris describes it, that runs through Sunday. It's a full-evening venture blending dance, video, poetry and music, and it shows how hip-hop forms can convey a complex story with seriousness and eloquence.</p>
        <p>The work, which had its world premiere in June in Philadelphia and will tour internationally through 2002, is a breakthrough for the 36-year-old Mr. Harris, who with his Philadelphia-based company, Rennie Harris Puremovement, has become a central figure in hip-hop dance. Since performing with top rap acts in the 80's, he has turned to creating choreography that is not governed, he says, by the commercial imperatives of the recording industry or the misogynistic swagger with which hip-hop is so often identified.</p>
        <p>In ''Rome and Jewels,'' Mr. Harris has transformed Shakespeare's play into a work of dance theater about his experience growing up in Philadelphia in the 1970's, when it was filled with what he calls ''the madness of gang energy.'' In this setting, Shakespeare's story crash-lands in a morally ambiguous world permeated by death and despair. Its rules are those of the street. ''Beat love down!'' gang members chant. And they are right to do so, for in the end love proves the catalyst for wholesale slaughter. Here, in a neighborhood where time is measured in lives routinely cut short, Shakespeare's ''ancient grudge'' is measured in days rather than generations, its pair of ''star-crossed homeys'' resigned to their own deaths from their first meeting.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Harris's version of the story, the two houses of Verona have been transmuted into warring Philly gangs whose names are variations on Shakespeare's Montagues and Capulets: the ''Monster Q's,'' led by Rome (Rodney Mason), and the ''Caps,'' headed by Tibault (Ron Wood). Events are presided over by the narrator Ozzie Jones, who alternately serves as the lethal agent of Rome's fate and as a one-man Greek chorus. When Rome falls in love with Tibault's girlfriend, Jewels (an invisible presence), his henchmen, Ben V. (Sabela Grimes) and Merc (Clyde Evans Jr.), try in vain to dissuade him from pursuing her. Inevitably, the gangs go to war, and no one escapes the resulting carnage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris maintains that creating ''Rome and Jewels,'' his first full-length piece, was the most arduous challenge of his career, taking three years to complete. But it was only recently, he confessed, that he began to understand why the act of creation had been so wrenching. At first, he said, he approached the material in an objective manner and assumed that his difficulty with it lay in his emotional distance from it. But he has since changed his mind. Now he believes he was struggling because he was unwittingly plumbing his own psyche, trying to come to terms with the callous attitudes toward violence and women that formed the parlance of his youth.</p>
        <p>''To be honest,'' Mr. Harris said, ''Rome is me at this moment. We each have one foot in the street and one foot in the universe.''</p>
        <p>The street Harris refers to is his native turf of North Philadelphia. It's a world in which, as his official biography states, he has ''watched friends join gangs, deal drugs and ruin their lives.''</p>
        <p>It is also a world that remains all too real offstage. Before the premiere of ''Rome and Jewels,'' a member of the troupe, Alphy McCullough, a quiet and sweet-visaged dancer in his early 20's, was murdered while standing outside a club in Philadelphia. The police have yet to determine whether he was a target or an innocent bystander. In a particularly chilling irony, Mr. McCullough had played the Angel of Death in ''Rome and Jewels.'' Afterward, Mr. Harris considered replacing him, but in the end, he said, he decided that ''Alphy is still with us in these performances.''</p>
        <p>MR. HARRIS began his escape from the streets at 14, when he joined a dance tour put together by the Smithsonian Institution. Before he entered high school, he was ''a stepper,'' a practitioner of a local Philadelphia dance form derived from tapping. Then he joined the Scanner Boys, a hip-hop dance troupe that toured the country with early rap M.C.'s like Run-D.M.C., the Fat Boys and Kurtis Blow. Back in Philadelphia, still in his early 20's, he directed videos and choreographed and directed several contemporary operas while continuing to work with the Scanner Boys. Nine years ago, he began moving away from the commercial world to concert dance, when he was invited to choreograph a presentation at Philadelphia's Movement Theater International. The last work on the program, ''Pure Movement,'' became the name of his company, which he formed shortly afterward.</p>
        <p>''I always thought that hip-hop was the epitome of pure movement,'' Mr. Harris said, ''meaning it encourages the creation of a personal movement style, without anyone else's influence. It doesn't need formal training or someone else's structures.''</p>
        <p>The title, he said, also addressed the collision of the hip-hop aesthetic with Eurocentric concepts of artmaking. ''If it's good, why shouldn't it be accepted?'' Mr. Harris asked. ''Why should people continue to ask me, as they do constantly, 'Are you formally trained?' '' His answer comes with weary exasperation.</p>
        <p>''Yes, I am,'' he said. ''I trained in the streets, and I trained at my mother's barbecues.''</p>
        <p>All these lessons, from the street to the concert stage, find a place in ''Rome and Jewels''; in Rome's journey of self-discovery, Mr. Harris echoes his own -- from ''Cro-magnon Man,'' as he put it, to someone who is ''fully human.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris says the way Rome carries himself, with his rhythmically dipping ''hip-hop walk,'' is an example of the kind of ''hard core'' mask that both he and Rome adopted as a ''mechanism of defense'' to survive the streets.</p>
        <p>Rome's first appearance on stage is shocking: he is pawing over the lifeless bodies of gang war victims like an animal. Over the course of the work, Rome finds an opening to a larger world of thought and feeling through his love for Jewels. Rejecting the swaggering movements that the hard-core code would impose on him,  Rome slips out of this bodily armor in his vulnerable pursuit of Jewels and in making love to her (though she is not visible) like a devotee of a hip-hop Kama Sutra. Ultimately, however, Rome is forced back into what Mr. Harris calls ''taking care of business,'' joining in gang warfare with his fellow Monster Q's to avenge Merc's death.</p>
        <p>These battles are portrayed through competing hip-hop dance styles, with the Caps as ''b-boyers'' and the Monster Q's as hip-hoppers. Developed in the Bronx during the 60's and 70's and often misnamed break dancing, b-boying is grounded in acrobatic floor maneuvers, or ''power moves.'' As a dance form, hip-hop refers to stylized social dances emphasizing rhythmically intricate footwork, a style that became popular with backup singers in the 80's. In Mr. Harris's schema, these competing dance styles function as both identifying gang colors and as weapons of gang warfare. But even while their dancing declares their allegiance to their gangs, the members are most respected for their ability to improvise -- to assert themselves as individuals -- within these dance forms.</p>
        <p>In creating the work, Mr. Harris has recognized the links between Shakespeare's virtuosic verbal play and the spoken traditions of African-American music. Tracing its origins back to Africa -- where song often centers on the improvisational manipulation of language rather than of the voice -- contemporary rapping is the hip-hop version of this tradition. Just as Shakespeare did, M.C.'s -- or rappers -- delight in word play, not to mention derision and boasting. In ''Rome and Jewels,'' Mr. Harris has blended fragments of Shakespeare's text, as well as excerpts from the Sonnets and ''Hamlet,'' with original verse by Mr. Harris and Mr. Grimes, Mr. Mason, Mr. Jones (who also functions as dramaturg) and Raphael Xavier Williams. Mr. Harris's text is heart-rending, witty and angry -- a counterpart to Shakespeare's rich milieu of poetry, comic bawdiness and horrific tragedy.</p>
        <p>WHILE Shakespeare provided the template for ''Rome and Jewels,'' Mr. Harris turned to the DJ booth and the recording studio for many of the work's narrative techniques. A distinguishing characteristic of hip-hop is its adapting electronic technology to an African-American aesthetic; this can be heard in ''Rome and Jewels'' in the live synthesizing of sound and video (by Darrin Ross and Howard Goldkrand, respectively) and in the mixing and scratching of its DJ orchestra (DJ Mr. Cisum, DJ Miz and DJ Evil Tracy).</p>
        <p>More surprising, electronic techniques are also used in manipulating language and movement: slowing down, breaking up, adding echo and reverb, ''skipping'' (like a needle on a record), playing backward (like a tape being rewound) and morphing (like the transformation of a digitized picture).</p>
        <p>Told with such skilled assurance, ''Rome and Jewels'' is its own cure for the despair it documents, as the bleakness of the story gives way to the exhilaration of its storytelling. The making of ''Rome and Jewels,'' Mr. Harris said, was a journey toward self-knowledge, its lesson the realization that art ''can be a form of salvation,'' a ''slow pulling into the rest of the universe.'' In that universe he has found the means to rewrite the law of the streets to insist that love and tenderness and openness have a place there too.</p>
