        <p>IT used to be called investment dressing. A quiet elegance, a dignified calm, poise and regal carriage are the making of a fresh, conservative style. Four women at last week's spring fashion collections in the tents in Bryant Park and other sites around New York City captured this style and stood out among the thousands of guests.</p>
        <p>The inspiration for this low-key look goes back 70 years, to an era when fashion rules were set by the Paris couturiers, who dressed women as ladies. Today, a new generation of designers has embraced that spirit and taken a fresh approach to understatement in dress.</p>

        <p>IT used to be called investment dressing. A quiet elegance, a dignified calm, poise and regal carriage are the making of a fresh, conservative style. Four women at last week's spring fashion collections in the tents in Bryant Park and other sites around New York City captured this style and stood out among the thousands of guests.</p>
        <p>The inspiration for this low-key look goes back 70 years, to an era when fashion rules were set by the Paris couturiers, who dressed women as ladies. Today, a new generation of designers has embraced that spirit and taken a fresh approach to understatement in dress.</p>
        <p>The look is built on a flawless fit and dressmaker details: subtle colors and discreet fabric patterns.</p>
        <p>The style is based on what was perceived in the 1930's and 40's as good breeding, set in motion by Molyneux, Vionnet, Lelong and Mainbocher. Banished from this vision of fashion are all the recent eccentricities and bizarre and exotic exaggerations that dominate many of the top design collections in Paris today.</p>
        <p>Far left, Brooke de Ocampo wore a Marc Jacobs suit that captured dressmaker details perfectly with its leather appliques.</p>
        <p>Left, Mallary C. Kean went directly to the source for her coat -- a family closet filled with Mainbocher clothes from the 1950's.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lisa Aerin, right, epitomized the look in a red coat with flaring silhouette, narrow shoulders and slim sleeves, insert fabric belt and separate fur collar, over a demure bias-cut print dress, all from Prada.</p>
        <p>Anna Wintour, far right, wore a suit jacket with a set-in grosgrain belt and a leather skirt. Her Prada jacket, whose construction, fit and tailoring techniques predate the rigid Balenciaga style, spoke volumes for the ladylike Park Avenue look.</p>
