        <p>WITH a celebratory nod to the past and a major push to ensure the future by creating new audiences, the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts begins its 20th season next month.</p>
        <p>While no new series will be in the offing, the anniversary year will feature house debuts by performers like the violinist Gidon Kremer and Ballet Folklorico de Mexico; two mid week concerts by the Billy Taylor Trio, and the customary sprinkling of international stars like Itzhak Perlman, the Tokyo String Quartet, James Galway and the San Francisco Symphony.</p>
        <p>In addition, the center is going to focus on outreach, ''making sure that every child has a chance to experience and feel the arts,'' said Elliott Sroka, the center's executive director since 1986.</p>
        <p>Arts-in-education programming will be expanded to include 19 performances by 10 different groups. These daytime shows at Tilles are only for schools and can, at the schools' discretion, include in-house training for teachers and pre-performance workshops for the students. Last year 12,000 students from 49 school districts throughout the Island saw 13 shows by 8 groups.</p>
        <p>Tilles, on the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University, is also entering into a partnership with the Lincoln Center Institute, a pioneer in arts in education. Working in the Manhasset and Freeport districts, the institute will help Tilles train 30 teaching artists based on Long Island who will eventually be available to go into the schools on a regular basis, not just to prepare students for specific programs.</p>
        <p>All told, the outreach program will cost Tilles about $500,000; last year $275,000 was spent. ''One of our missions is to educate future audiences, nurture audiences and performers for and of the next generation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Tilles officials have more on their minds than what is on stage.  About $4 million has already been raised toward a $10 million to $15 million capital plan. That includes a $1.1 million grant from New York State that Mr. Sroka said would mostly be used to ''maintain, upgrade and improve the center physically.''</p>
        <p>Some of that work involves projects that got pushed aside in the rush to open for the 1981 season.</p>
        <p>For that first season, which had a budget of $507,000, the hall presented 12 events seen by 20,000 people. For the 1998-99 season, the last year for which figures are available, more than 102,000 people attended 90 events. This season, the budget of $6.3 million will cover a comparable number of shows.</p>
        <p>''Without a doubt it has had a positive influence on the cultural life of Long Island,'' said Teddy Bookman, the executive director of Friends of the Arts. ''It has been a catalyst to bring extraordinary performers to the Island.''</p>
        <p>The Friends, a group that began presenting dance and classical music on the Island in 1973, was one of Tilles's initial tenants for its Great Performances series. But with ''the graying of the audience,'' Ms. Bookman said, by 1996 ''there wasn't enough of an audience for both us and Tilles, so we decided to concentrate on other aspects of our programming.''</p>
        <p>The Sea Cliff Chamber Players and the National Grand Opera, which used to be major renters, are no longer in business, so the only arts groups still using the hall are the Long Island Philharmonic and the Eglvesky Ballet. The bulk of each season is programmed by Tilles.</p>
        <p>Before Tilles, promoters like Friends of the Arts used school auditoriums or movie houses for their concerts. While the Staller Center on the Stony Brook campus of the State University opened in 1975, with its 1,000-seat main stage and smaller theaters it was considered too small to make the presentation of large orchestras and major performers economically feasible -- and too far east to accommodate Nassau residents.</p>
        <p>Recognizing a need for a more centrally located professional concert venue, in the 1970's Long Island University officials built the Dome Concert Hall at C. W. Post. When the Dome collapsed after a heavy snow in 1978, the current building, with a main theater that seats 2,200 and the 491-seat adjacent Hillwood Recital Hall, was built at the cost of $4.4 million. It was originally known as the C. W. Post Concert Theater but took the name of Gilbert and Rose Tilles in 1986 after the family donated $1.1 million.</p>
        <p>Tilles has found traditional classical music audiences graying out or retiring off the Island, so it began programming pop, jazz and special events to appeal to younger people. It found that children's concerts also brought their parents, all potential ticket-buyers, to the hall, and it booked ethnic performances meant to attract newcomers to the Island.</p>
        <p>The theater must be doing something right, Mr. Sroka believes, because eight weeks before the anniversary season opened, about 85 percent of their audience members were subscribers.</p>
        <p>Last year, 16 percent of subscriptions were sold to people from Suffolk communities as far away as Stony Brook and Hauppauge and 7 percent went to residents of Queens and Brooklyn. Even within Nassau, Mr. Sroka said, the reach has increased dramatically to South Shore communities like Baldwin, Freeport, Massapequa and Long Beach.</p>
        <p>''We've created an institution that's constantly reinventing itself and perpetuating itself, one that the public supports,'' Mr. Sroka said. ''We're close to raising a $10 million endowment, because we're meeting the growing demands for lively and vital arts.''</p>
        <p>The Tilles Center's 20th anniversary season opens on Oct. 6 with ''An Evening With Marvin Hamlisch.'' Information: (516) 299-3100.</p>
