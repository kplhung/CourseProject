        <p>FOR the past 10 years, the Signature Theater Company, which devotes each of its seasons to the work of a single writer, has been home to many of the nation's leading playwrights, including Edward Albee, Arthur Miller and Maria Irene Fornes. This season, however, is something of a departure for the company; instead of featuring a single playwright, it has invited each of its past nine resident writers to submit a new play, with the goal of producing nine New York premieres over the next 20 months. Overseen by the artistic director James Houghton, the series officially began on Sept. 17, with the opening of ''A Lesson Before Dying'' by Romulus Linney (a related article is on Page 18). The next production, ''The Last of Thorntons,'' by Horton Foote, is to open in early December.</p>
        <p>The New York Times recently brought together a panel of playwrights to ask how their experiences at Signature had affected their artistic process, both while they were in residency at the company and afterward.

        <p>FOR the past 10 years, the Signature Theater Company, which devotes each of its seasons to the work of a single writer, has been home to many of the nation's leading playwrights, including Edward Albee, Arthur Miller and Maria Irene Fornes. This season, however, is something of a departure for the company; instead of featuring a single playwright, it has invited each of its past nine resident writers to submit a new play, with the goal of producing nine New York premieres over the next 20 months.

The next production, ''The Last of Thorntons,'' by Horton Foote, is to open in early December.</p>
        <p>The New York Times recently brought together a panel of playwrights to ask how their experiences at Signature had affected their artistic process, both while they were in residency at the company and afterward. The panel, which included Mr. Albee, Mr. Miller, Ms. Fornes, Mr. Foote, and John Guare, was moderated by The Times's theater columnist, Jesse McKinley.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- What was the effect of seeing a full season of your work staged? Has it changed any of your subsequent work, or your opinion of your earlier writing?</p>
        <p>GUARE -- I think the thing that surprised me the most was when I was watching ''Marco Polo Sings a Solo'' and suddenly realized that I would not have been able to write ''Six Degrees of Separation'' without having written ''Marco Polo.'' I realized, because I could see the continuity, that ''Marco Polo'' somehow freed me, it gave me a new voice, a voice that I had not had, or heard, before. I mean, it sounds fancy to talk about, but I think that ''Marco'' gave me an elevated style, and I realized how important that was to me, just as a writer, just in terms of upping the verbal ante. And that realization never would have happened if they hadn't brought ''Marco Polo'' out of the shed.</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- For me, I had a lot of short plays, some of which had been done before, but others that fell during that 10- or 12-year period where it seemed nobody was allowed to do any of my plays in New York.</p>
        <p>GUARE -- The city had that order of protection out against you.</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- [Laughs] Yes. They'd been done everywhere else, but they were getting their first New York production. I believe we did the plays sequentially, from the earliest one to the most recent one in my season. So I think that was sort of interesting to let people see the regression [laughs].</p>
        <p>FOOTE -- In my case, Jim had asked for three plays, and the only stipulation was that one had to be created for the season. So the last one that I wrote was one that I had started 18 years ago and I had put it aside. One day, I was searching for something to work on and I found it and I read it and I thought, ''Well, I still don't know how to solve this,'' but I knew Jim was expecting something new.</p>
        <p>So I took a ride. And in the course of that ride, I went by the house I was writing about, and it was all boarded up. And I thought, ''Strange.'' And I don't know what happened -- something happened -- but I was invited to a breakfast the next morning and a woman came to me and said, ''Do you remember me?'' And I lied and I said, ''Yes.'' I didn't remember her at all. But she was the 18-year-old girl I had been thinking about in the play.</p>
        <p>And the whole thing just opened up. And I don't think, unless Jim wanted this play, I would have done it.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- How was the experience of producing a play at the Signature different from other productions you've had of late, if it was different?</p>
        <p>MILLER -- It's really very simple: it's that the emphasis here is on the creative act. And it isn't that way in a commercial theater. The commercial theater is hype and it's pressure and it's all kinds of things about money and everything else. And what's up onstage becomes this ancillary thing.</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- Considering some of the horrors that take place in commercial production, where you're supposed to rewrite, or you have to bring everything down to simple declarative sentences, or you've got a star who's incompetent----</p>
        <p>GUARE -- Name names.</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- Not this time. Seriously, there's no pressure of that sort here. This is a playwright's theater. The fact a playwright gets an entire season is unique. I mean, these next two years, it's sort of a different thing. But it is a playwright's theater. We each have new work. We each have work that has not been seen before in New York or has not been seen by anybody for a long time. And people begin to get away from that erroneous idea that you're as good as your last play. Which is nonsense. Sometimes you're a lot better than your last play. And sometimes you're not as good as your last play. But we get away from that. And people get a whole perspective of what we've been doing for our entire careers. That's exciting. And I didn't notice any pressures. You want to do this play? Let's get the best cast we can possibly get, the best director, and let's do it as you ordered.</p>
        <p>FORNES -- I found that the experience working here was wonderful. But I am, in some ways, lucky that I'm not as successful or well known as the gentlemen who are with me here. What I mean by that is simply my work is not done on Broadway. My work is more Off Off Broadway, and not even Off Broadway.</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- Our work isn't done on Broadway very much.</p>
        <p>FORNES -- No, but still, if you look back, it's almost like a different type of work. I never imagined that I would be a playwright. I never imagined that I would be dedicating my life to this. I started as a painter. So when I started writing, a play just came, like, without any intention of being my future or my profession or my career. I started doing it out of some sort of inspiration that came to me. But once you have that kind of experience, you have to be crazy to give it up. And it happened almost accidentally, almost like you're walking along and then there is an electric wire and you touch it and you get almost electrocuted. And there it is. And----</p>
        <p>GUARE -- And you keep going back to the wire.</p>
        <p>FORNES -- Right.</p>
        <p>GUARE -- One more shock.</p>
        <p>FORNES -- Right. And suddenly, it was my hope, my dream. For the first time, I did something that I was very excited about. The pleasure of doing it was enormous, but the pressure wasn't.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- To touch another topic, what is that like to go back to this work that you wrote 20, 30, 40 years ago? Many of the works done here are seldom-seen revivals.</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- Can we make a pact not to use that awful term ''revival?'' Being back from the dead is a revival.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- New production, then.</p>
        <p>GUARE -- Well, I think that a play in a sense is an exorcism. I mean you write a play because it's dealing with something that you want to clean out of your life. You're trying to come to terms with something. And when it's over, whatever the result of the play is, you're moving on to something else.</p>
        <p>MILLER -- You develop a kind of affectionate objectivity about it.</p>
        <p>GUARE -- Yes. I must say that the production of two plays, ''Marco Polo'' and ''Buxoms and Neglect,'' brought back the reasons why I had written them. And in them were, for the lack of better words, ''codes'' to me, things I could read. I found it very disturbing.</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- You didn't change them, though?</p>
        <p>GUARE -- No, no, no. No, I didn't change them. But it was like being thrown back into a Laundromat of time. And I did not feel objective. I felt when I was in the play that I was back where I was when I was writing the play. I felt very much in the present of that play, which was very surprising. But you can't change or improve or else use the benefit of 20 years later to say, ''Oh, I know how to fix that.'' You have to say, ''This is the way I dealt with it then.''</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- Arthur, what about you?</p>
        <p>MILLER -- Well, I did a wonderful production here of ''The American Clock.''</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- Had you looked at it before it went up here?</p>
        <p>MILLER -- No. I don't have to look at it. I can remember it; I wrote it [laughs]. It was something that nobody in the commercial theater would ever think of doing. It's too big to do. There are too many actors in it. Like everything else, the commercial theater is good for two-handers or three or four at the most. So there's really no fundamental continuity possible in that environment. And so this is really the best substitute we've got. Of course, I don't have to tell you that you can't do any straight play anymore unless it's been successful in London or some other place. I can't remember when a Broadway producer produced a new play.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- Unless it was at Manhattan Theater Club.</p>
        <p>MILLER -- Yes, but before that, it's been probably 15 years. Maybe longer. And the result is that they gave it all over to the musical, and there are really no producers very much.</p>
        <p>GUARE -- But I don't think any of us have a dream of being on Broadway anymore.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- Do you think that the experience here at Signature has any reference, say, in what things were like in the 1950's or 1960's? Is this closer to what it used to be like?</p>
        <p>GUARE -- Very much. I felt it was very seat-of-the-pants theater. It reminded me of being with the O'Neill. Because my new play was going to be a different play. And then at the last minute, about not quite eight weeks before we were due to open, or less than eight weeks, we realized we had to quick, put in another play. I went and found a play that was not finished that I hadn't expected to do.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- This was ''Lake Hollywood''?</p>
        <p>GUARE -- Yeah. And what I loved about it was that we had to throw it up and I had to figure the play out. And on opening night I said, ''Oh, my God, that's not what I meant.'' And what was terrific about it was that the people from the Guthrie had come to see the play and liked it. And asked if they could do it. And I said, ''Yes, I could rewrite it.'' So I went out to Minnesota. And all I could think of was, I did it in New York to get it ready for Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>MILLER -- New York is out of town.</p>
        <p>GUARE -- Exactly. New York is out of town. But New York was ready; it was there to get it ready for Minneapolis. And so it was all part of that idea of the American national theater; of New York as a link with all resident theaters and regional theaters all over the country as a national theater. And to be a playwright today is to be a Willy Loman, where you take your plays in a suitcase and go anywhere.</p>
        <p>FORNES -- That is to me what I'm after all the time. And Broadway has never been a possibility for me, in my mind. Today, to try to hope for a production on Broadway, which is going to have certain elements that are more satisfying because you might get a better actor, all you might get is a better set.</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- We're not commercial hacks, either, honey.</p>
        <p>GUARE -- But you had a very bad experience, Irene. Your first show, ''The Office,'' directed by Jerry Robbins, with Elaine May, that Jerry Robbins, the brilliant Jerry Robbins, pulled the plug on just before it opened. So I mean, you've had a very, very bad experience in the commercial world.</p>
        <p>FOOTE -- I think what's wonderful about the Signature Theater is that it's eclectic: it doesn't demand one kind of playwright or a certain choice of play. I mean, that includes Irene and Arthur and all of us. Our styles are very different here. Its secret, it seems, is to try out the new work, the way it might 30 years ago. It just happened here that we just did it in a dyslexic way. But it was very much in the spirit of an earlier era.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- You've been asked by Jim to come up with a new play in the next 20 months. How does the atmosphere here differ from if you have to put it on Broadway?</p>
        <p>FOOTE -- Well, you don't expect that kind of pressure. You don't feel limited in what you want to write about.</p>
        <p>MILLER -- Right.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- Low expectation?</p>
        <p>GUARE -- No. And it's not low expectation or even low pressure because you put pressure on yourself. Whether you're doing a play on Broadway or here, believe me, there's no difference. It's no different. You're not saying, hey, well, it's only 12th Avenue, you know, I can just -- I just need one AAA battery.</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- Everybody wants to make money and everybody wants to get good reviews. But the plays that we do here are not in the expectation that they'll be commercially successful, or that they will get good commercial reviews. They're not done with that expectation. That's not a lower expectation; it's a totally different kind of expectation.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- Is it higher?</p>
        <p>GUARE -- Yes, I think it is higher.</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- Because the pressures, the commercial pressures don't exist here.</p>
        <p>GUARE -- So it's a moral pressure. It's your life; it's aesthetic pressure. It sounds fancy to talk about, but believe me, that's much more demanding to have a whip at the back than saying, you know, they didn't laugh, how are we going to run for another week and the ad campaign has to change.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- Do you think the plays that you're going to be writing are going to be different because of the experience here?</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- Well, I can only speak for myself, but I think the play that I'm going to be doing here next fall is probably -- if it's the one I think it is, if I ever get finished with the one I'm finishing now -- I think it is going to probably be the most experimental play I've ever written. Which means that it'll be absolutely straightforward, absolutely----</p>
        <p>GUARE -- Because of this space, inspired by this space?</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- No, because I know that here there's an audience that is not going to be puzzled by three-syllable words and they are not going to start walking out because the play demands paying attention to. And here I'll be free to make my experiments to see whether they work or not. And that's one of the things that are exciting about this.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- What about everybody else?</p>
        <p>GUARE -- The play I have that I've been working on might be a more intimate play. A smaller play. And I just hadn't thought of that until this very moment, but I think that being here, when you do a play here, you rely on the good will of so many actors and people that it's better to do a play that doesn't kill a cast of 15, 18.</p>
        <p>FOOTE -- ''Thortons'' is a play I've had in mind for a while, but it's because I'm here that I'm doing it. When I was a young playwright, I was asked to meet with a very established playwright. He told me that he wanted to help me because Broadway, which was then flourishing, needed playwrights, and he said he had two examples that served him well. One was never write a play about someone you wouldn't entertain in your own living room. And it was not very encouraging, because one of those plays I wanted to write, you know, wouldn't fit. So I just nodded and smiled.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- Who was the playwright?</p>
        <p>FOOTE -- I'm not going to tell you [laughter]. But all I mean to say is that it was not very encouraging, because one of those plays I wanted to write. And the other rule, I go back and forth about. The other one was that when I take my plays out of town, I never watch the actors; I only watch the audience.</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- Of course, we all learn that.</p>
        <p>FOOTE -- And you finally find a way to handle all that, don't you? You just say, well, to hell with you, I'm writing a new play. I mean, you know----</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- We are writers of plays.</p>
        <p>GUARE -- We write. And that reminds people out there that it is not television, which is written by committees of writers, or movies written by committees of writers, that there is such a thing -- and I think being a playwright is probably the second-oldest profession -- but I mean, it's greater, it's a thrill.</p>
        <p>FOOTE -- Its rewards are there. Just the writing of it is the reward, really, isn't it?</p>
        <p>GUARE -- Writing it and then putting it on. You write a play and when you're ready to show it to somebody, a whole new world opens up. A whole new world opens up. And we're writers of plays about now: Horton and Irene and Edward and Arthur and all the young writers coming up as we speak. We're writing about what it's like to be alive now.</p>
        <p>FORNES -- I think that as a writer, you are -- I'm already thinking I'm wrong -- you are riveted from the day you begin writing. And you are obsessed with it and you are entertained by it, and when you stop, it's because you're tired and you're dying the next day to go back to it; you are the first audience to your own output. You are in heaven. It's like a love affair. And everybody else can disapprove of it and think you're an idiot, but when you had it, you never forget it, and that is really what lives inside you. And it is in the work. Because you always find one person or another who has experienced the same thing that you experienced.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- Have you all experienced that feeling?</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- Oh, yes, I was just thinking, a couple of days ago I finished a play. I see them and hear them on the stage as I write them. I finished a play and I had the bizarre feeling: Gee, I've had the experience of it; I don't need to see it. Completely forgetting the fact that one of the reasons that I'd written it was not just for my own satisfaction, because I wanted other people to share it. But just for that one moment, I've had the experience of it, and I didn't need anything else. I realized that was foolish, ultimately.</p>
        <p>FOOTE -- But it is exciting to have that experience.</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- It's wonderful.</p>
        <p>McKINLEY -- It means you're doing something right.</p>
        <p>ALBEE -- Still, you know that old phrase about people falling through the cracks: some people get famous and people who are just as good don't get famous?</p>
        <p>GUARE -- Yes. We're very lucky to have been, to be part of this world.</p>
        <p>FOOTE -- Yes.</p>
