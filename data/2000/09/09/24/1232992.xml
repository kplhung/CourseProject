        <p>THE RACE TO THE</p>
        <p>WHITE CONTINENT</p>
        <p>By Alan Gurney.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 320 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $26.95.</p>
        <p>At the outset of ''The Race to the White Continent,'' Alan Gurney invokes ''the Ulysses factor.'' By this he means the spirit that animates discovery. Put differently, Ulysses is the archetype of the explorer, always fleeing from the common lot. Homer, with literary tact, does not describe his end. It was left to Dante to do so. In the ''Inferno,'' he lets the aging Ulysses embark on one last voyage and has him drowning off an ''unknown land'' in a storm. Dante places this near the South Pole, thus anticipating by a good 500 years the modern obsession with the Antarctic.</p>
        <p>''The Race to the White Continent'' is in essence the story of the expeditions that paved the way for the race to the South Pole. All took place in the late 1830's and early 1840's. These were years of transition. It was the time when, in Switzerland, Louis Agassiz introduced his theory of ice ages, thus revolutionizing our view of the past and perhaps the future too. In England, Queen Victoria ascended the throne and opened the age of industrialization, scientific advance and an optimistic belief in human progress to which she gave her name. Meanwhile, the United States was preparing to occupy the continent from sea to shining sea. The modern world was being born. Polar exploration was merely part of the process.</p>
        <p>Since the 18th century, various navigators had reduced the unknown regions of the Southern Hemisphere to a blob at the bottom of the globe, roughly bounded by the 60th parallel and surrounded by a stormy ocean. The men who accomplished this reconnaissance ranged from rapacious Yankee whalers and sealers to the somewhat different character of Capt. James Cook, a British naval officer and an explorer to his fingertips, but nonetheless a man with a hidden political, expansionist agenda. Gurney, the author of ''Below the Convergence: Voyages Toward Antarctica, 1699-1839,'' deals knowledgeably with this variegated prelude to his tale.</p>
        <p>There was a natural urge to probe the remaining mystery. National prestige was also part of the impulse that drove the three expeditions that form the kernel of his book. One was French, another English, and the third was American. Their leaders were, respectively, Jules Sebastien Cesar Dumont d'Urville, James Clark Ross and Charles Wilkes. They were all naval officers, sent out by their governments.</p>
        <p>D'Urville was like something out of a novel by his contemporary, Balzac. Having served in the Napoleonic Wars, d'Urville was of the generation marked by defeat. Part of him still wistfully looked back on the days of glory under Bonaparte. It was through d'Urville that the Venus de Milo was brought to France. He saw his Antarctic expedition as redeeming, in a small way, the stigma of national disaster.</p>
        <p>James Clark Ross was his opposite. After victory at Trafalgar and Waterloo, Britain was the greatest power on earth and, under the mantle of the Pax Britannica, had become the arbiter of war and peace. At least that was true where the Royal Navy held sway, which broadly meant anywhere on the seven seas. Ross was going south as the British Empire was expanding, in the belief that any undiscovered land was an Englishman's birthright.</p>
        <p>In contrast again to both Ross and d'Urville was Charles Wilkes. The French government needed little persuasion to send out an expedition; the English, not much more. America was a different matter altogether. This was to be the first official United States polar expedition. National prestige was not as persuasive an argument as elsewhere. Naval officers were not supposed to go exploring. Politicians in Washington objected strongly to the cost. A minor crusade was necessary to extract the funds. There was much intrigue before Wilkes found himself in command -- still a mere lieutenant, whereas Ross and d'Urville were captains both. They, moreover, had commanded previous expeditions. In fact, Ross had been the first man to reach the north magnetic pole and hoped to repeat the performance in the south.</p>
        <p>Wilkes, on the other hand, had no polar experience. Nonetheless, pitting himself against Ross and d'Urville, he embarked on the first Antarctic race. This was essentially to reach the Furthest South and find land. A few early scattered discoveries suggested a whole terra incognita hidden in high latitudes. The three expeditions were entirely under sail. They were the last of their kind, before the introduction of powered craft. They thus brought a whole era of discovery to a close and ushered in another aspect of modernity. This is Gurney's underlying theme.</p>
        <p>His principals were all sailors. Their tales belong not so much to polar travel as the history of the sea. In this the author is utterly at ease. He is obviously at home with sailing ships, with those who manned them and the precise, graphic language that they contrived. Consequently, there is a refreshing gusto to this book.</p>
        <p>ROSS is justifiably Gurney's hero. In the heyday of English power, his was the best prepared of the three expeditions. He sailed in two strong reinforced wooden ships, Erebus and Terror, well adapted to the ice. They were later to achieve doubtful fame as the expedition craft of Sir John Franklin, who disappeared with all his men in the Arctic searching for the Northwest Passage.</p>
        <p>Leaving England in September 1839, Ross spent the southern winter in Tasmania and finally headed south in November of the following year. He met the pack ice just over the Antarctic Circle. On Jan. 4, 1841, he put his ships into the floes. Four days later, he ran out into the open sea that now bears his name. He discovered hundreds of miles of coastline running south, and the Ross Ice Shelf into the bargain. He had found the huge bight denting the Antarctic continent and shown his successors the way to the pole.</p>
        <p>His great deed, however, had been to penetrate the pack by sail alone. In tribute, Gurney quotes the eventual victor of the race to the South Pole, Roald Amundsen, 70 years on: ''These men sailed right into the heart of the pack, which all previous polar explorers had regarded as certain death. It is not merely difficult to grasp this, it is simply impossible -- to us, who with a motion of the hand can set the screw going, and wriggle out of the first difficulty we encounter. These men were heroes -- heroes in the highest sense of the word.''</p>
        <p>By comparison, d'Urville and Wilkes had played an ironic supporting role. They had designedly forestalled Ross in his chosen field between the 120th and 150th meridians east. Refusing to follow in anyone's tracks, he decided to go south around 170 degrees east longitude instead. Unknowingly, his rivals had driven him to the entrance of the Ross Sea and enabled him to make his discoveries. He returned to England in 1843 a famous man, having discovered more of the Antarctic coast than anyone before the advent of flying.</p>
        <p>D'Urville was first to sail, first to come home and first to discover new land. In September 1837, he left Toulon with two corvettes, Astrolabe and Zelee, returning toward the end of 1840. Earlier that year, he had sighted an unknown part of the Antarctic coastline he called Terre Adelie, after his wife, and as such it remains on the map. D'Urville was satisfied with the distant view, leaving further investigation to anyone ''sufficiently fortunate and bold enough to break through the masses of accumulated ice.''</p>
        <p>Gurney does not quite approve of this piece of what he calls ''Gallic insouciance.'' His attitude toward Wilkes is understandably rather more ambivalent. Ross and d'Urville were good leaders of men. Of Wilkes, Gurney says that nothing ''suggests any outstanding ability for . . . command. . . . What he did have was energy, determination, ruthlessness, ambition and . . . a suspicious nature, almost to the point of paranoia.'' This resulted in a miserable expedition, while the others were reasonably happy.</p>
        <p>The American expedition, Gurney mordantly remarks, was ''overweight,'' with ''2,157 tons of ship crewed by 490 men.'' Wilkes departed in August 1838 with a squadron of six ships, compared with the two each of Ross and d'Urville. It seemed out of proportion to the result. When Wilkes finally came home in 1842, it was to face a court-martial for his deplorable conduct as an officer. Worse still, land that he claimed to have discovered was subsequently sailed over by Ross. Wilkes was long dismissed as a fraud. Gurney believes he was ''fooled by one of the polar regions' atmospheric tricks: the looming that brings into view land below the horizon.''</p>
        <p>Either way, it was a hint of things to come. American polar exploration was thenceforth bedeviled by controversy. Did Frederick Cook or Robert Peary really attain the North Pole? Later, did Adm. Richard Byrd really fly to both the North and South Poles? The figure of Wilkes looms over them all.</p>
        <p>Which brings us back to Gurney's ''Ulysses factor,'' and perhaps to a yet older archetype: the Sumerian epic figure of Gilgamesh 4,000 years ago. ''He went on a long journey, was weary, worn out with labor,'' the clay tablets say. ''Returning he rested, he engraved on a stone the whole story.''</p>
        <p>Roland Huntford's latest books are ''Nansen,'' a biography of the Norwegian polar explorer, and a reissue of ''The Last Place on Earth,'' about the race for the South Pole between Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Amundsen.</p>
