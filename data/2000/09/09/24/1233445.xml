        <p>He had been sacked six times, the last one leaving him gasping for air. He fumbled the ball once and threw an interception inside his own 5-yard line. What is a freshman to do? With less than two minutes remaining, Michigan State quarterback Jeff Smoker got old and brave today.</p>
        <p>On fourth-and-10 on his 32-yard line and Notre Dame leading by a point, Smoker planted his back foot as the blitzing Irish defenders closed in. He rifled a pass through outstretched arms and between the hashmarks at midfield, where wide receiver Herb Haygood caught it in stride and galloped through the secondary and into the end zone with 1 minute 48 seconds to play.</p>

        <p>He had been sacked six times, the last one leaving him gasping for air. He fumbled the ball once and threw an interception inside his own 5-yard line. What is a freshman to do? With less than two minutes remaining, Michigan State quarterback Jeff Smoker got old and brave today.</p>
        <p>On fourth-and-10 on his 32-yard line and Notre Dame leading by a point, Smoker planted his back foot as the blitzing Irish defenders closed in. He rifled a pass through outstretched arms and between the hashmarks at midfield, where wide receiver Herb Haygood caught it in stride and galloped through the secondary and into the end zone with 1 minute 48 seconds to play.</p>
        <p>It was only Smoker's 12th completion, but it went for 68 yards and is the only one the 74,714 fans at Spartan Stadium will remember.</p>
        <p>It redeemed the backup.</p>
        <p>Michigan State: 27.</p>
        <p>Fighting Irish: 21.</p>
        <p>''I knew they were all coming, but I focused on Herb,'' said Smoker, who passed for 181 yards and 2 touchdowns. ''As soon as he broke, I threw. I saw one guy miss him, and I knew he was gone. It was great to just watch him run down the field and win the game.''</p>
        <p>It was another devastating loss for No. 16 Notre Dame (2-2). The Irish  had erased a 20-7 deficit in the fourth quarter by turning Smoker's miscues into points and capitalizing on some quick offense from their own freshman quarterback: Matt LoVecchio, a former New Jersey high school star at Bergen Catholic.</p>
        <p>When the Irish offense was inert late in the third quarter, Coach Bob Davie inserted LoVecchio for Gary Godsey, the converted tight end who started for the injured starter Arnaz Battle last week against Purdue. Against No. 23 Michigan State (3-0) Godsey struggled -- 4 of 15 for 20 yards and 1 touchdown.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to change up the tempo,'' Davie said. ''I think it's obvious our team functions better when we have someone who can run the ball.''</p>
        <p>But in the opening minutes of the fourth quarter, LoVecchio, an option quarterback, crossed the Spartans up when he threw a 43-yard pass -- his one and only attempt -- toward the end zone and Javin Hunter. It wobbled, it floated, but Hunter came back for it and gathered it in on the 2-yard line.</p>
        <p>On the next play, Julius Jones crashed over the goal line and the Irish had narrowed the deficit to 20-14.</p>
        <p>Then Smoker made the two big mistakes that made it look as if Notre Dame, which hasn't won a road game since winning at Navy in November 1998, might prevail. Smoker was in the shotgun at the Michigan State 28 when linebacker Tyreo Harrison burst through the line and knocked the ball loose at the 19-yard line. By the time defensive tackle Darrell Campbell smothered the ball, it had bounded to the Michigan State 12.</p>
        <p>But the Spartans' defense, which held the Irish to 212 total yards -- 126 of them by Jones on the ground -- stopped LoVecchio on fourth-and-1 at  the Spartans' 3-yard line.</p>
        <p>Seventy-five seconds later, however, Smoker wasn't so lucky. On third-and-15 at his own 11-yard line, he  hurried a screen pass intended for tailback Little John Flowers. Defensive end Anthony Weaver caught the ball in his stomach and was wrestled down by Flowers on the 2. Jones scored to give Notre Dame a 21-20 lead with 7:59 left.</p>
        <p>''Those were two huge mistakes, terrible turnovers,'' said Michigan State Coach Bobby Williams, who has been forced to play Smoker since the junior starter Ryan Van Dyke went out with a bruised right thumb in a season-opening triumph over Marshall. ''But Jeff is a tough kid, and he came back and made a huge play to win the game.''</p>
        <p>In the huddle before the decisive play, Michigan State running back T. J. Duckett, who ran for 141 yards and a 6-yard touchdown, could sense something startling was about to happen. ''He had that fire in his eyes,'' Duckett said of Smoker. ''I just knew something good was going to happen.''</p>
        <p>The Irish, who have lost four straight games against the Spartans, their longest losing streak against a team since Miami beat them four times starting in 1983, decided to go all out to prevent that from happening. Davie said he called for the blitz -- something he wished he had done on a key third-down play in their overtime loss to No. 1 Nebraska last week. The Irish didn't blitz then, and Nebraska converted and went on to win the game.</p>
        <p>''I called the defense and I take the responsibility for the call, but the kid beat us,'' Davie said. ''It is especially tough to scratch and claw your way into a game and putting yourself in a position to win. It's one of those things that you can't believe can happened. But it happened.''</p>
        <p>Haygood said: ''The corner who was covering me blitzed so I was wide open. I caught the ball, I looked up and all I saw was cheerleaders.''</p>
