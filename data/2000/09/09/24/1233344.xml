        <p>After a rocky week of earnings warnings, spikes in the price of oil and a euro in intensive care, the economic data this week may focus the market's thinking on the juggernaut underpinning what has been an unsinkable economy: the consumer.</p>
        <p>Reports on consumer confidence, durable goods, home resales and personal income and spending will be released this week. And none of the forecasts on those numbers anticipate any slowing from levels best described as hale.</p>
        <p>Although the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates several times, growth, while no longer breathless, remains healthy - despite the effects of oil and the euro. Kathleen Camilli, chief economic strategist at Tucker Anthony, said, Underneath all that noise, you still have very low unemployment, very good personal income growth and those things that translate into a very robust pace of consumer spending.</p>
        <p>After a week of volatile trading, both major indexes ended moderately lower. The Dow Jones industrial average closed off 0.7 percent, at 10,847.37. The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted in new-economy stocks, fell 0.8 percent last week, to 3,803.76.</p>
