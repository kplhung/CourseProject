        <p>WAITING, by Ha Jin. (Vintage International, $13.) This novel, which won a National Book Award in 1999, is about a Chinese Army doctor and a nurse who are forced to postpone their marriage for 18 years, the legal time period required before he can divorce without his spouse's consent. Ha Jin ''generously provides a dual education: a crash course in Chinese society during and since the Cultural Revolution, and a more leisurely but nonetheless compelling exploration of the less exotic terrain that is the human heart,'' Francine Prose said here.</p>
        <p>YEATS'S GHOSTS: The Secret Life of W. B. Yeats, by Brenda Maddox. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $16.) This portrait of the Irish poet focuses on his marriage and the couple's fascination with the occult and the ''spirit world,'' which inspired some of Yeats's greatest poetry and prose. ''Maddox's book is a blithe, energetic, jolly debunking operation,'' Hermione Lee said in the Book Review in 1999.</p>
        <p>I THE SUPREME, by Augusto Roa Bastos. (Dalkey Archive, $13.95.) This sweeping historical novel recounts the life of the Latin American despot Jose Gaspar Rodriguez Francia, who ruled Paraguay as ''Perpetual Dictator'' from 1816, soon after the withdrawal of Spanish authority, until his death in 1840. ''The result is a richly textured, brilliant book -- an impressive portrait, not only of El Supremo, but of a whole colonial society in the throes of learning how to swim, or how best to drown, in the seas of national independence,'' Carlos Fuentes wrote here in 1986.</p>
        <p>A FLAME OF PURE FIRE: Jack Dempsey and the Roaring 20's, by Roger Kahn. (Harvest/Harcourt, $15.) The sportswriter draws on his friendship with the legendary heavyweight champion to celebrate the life and times of an icon. ''Dempsey and his career make for a fine yarn, and when Kahn writes about fighters and fights, promoters and characters, his book is great fun,'' Warren Goldstein said here last year.</p>
        <p>OUT OF PLACE: A Memoir, by Edward W. Said. (Vintage, $14.) The scholar and cultural critic recounts his upbringing as a Christian Arab in Egypt and his alienating experiences in the United States, where he finished his education and took up the Palestinian cause. Last year our reviewer, Ian Buruma, said that while Said's account occasionally suffers from a pompous tone, his ''descriptions of growing up in a claustrophobic cocoon of wealth and an overprotective family are excellent.'' The same publisher has issued The Edward Said Reader, edited by Moustafa Bayoumi and Andrew Rubin ($15), a collection of diverse writings on topics ranging from Jane Austen to Middle East history. ''His great theme is the exile's experience,'' one reviewer said recently. ''This anthology succeeds in condensing the work of an intellect defined otherwise by its great expanse.''</p>
        <p>THE VINTNER'S LUCK, by Elizabeth Knox. (Picador USA, $13.) In 1808, a drunken French vintner is befriended by a mysterious angel named Xas, who becomes his drinking buddy, tempter, lover and storyteller. ''Xas is one of the best angels since William Blake's,'' Nina Auerbach wrote here in 1999, and this is an ''original, often astonishingly vivid novel.''</p>
        <p>BLUE AT THE MIZZEN, by Patrick O'Brian. (Norton, $13.95.) In the 20th -- and final -- volume in the author's acclaimed series of seafaring novels (he died in January at the age of 85), Capt. Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin are sent to Chile after Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo to assist in the fight for independence against Spain. The result is ''a shining jewel'' and ''an intricate, multifaceted work,'' Amanda Foreman wrote here last year. ''There is nothing in this century that rivals Patrick O'Brian's achievement in his chosen genre.''</p>
        <p>THE LITTLE LOCKSMITH: A Memoir, by Katharine Butler Hathaway. (Feminist Press, $14.95.) The author of this 1943 autobiography was 5 years old and a victim of spinal tuberculosis when she was strapped to a board in halters and pulleys. She emerged 10 years later stunted and crippled for life, and sustained herself through extraordinary faith and imaginative power. The result is ''the kind of book that cannot come into being without great living and great suffering and a rare spirit behind it,'' Edward Wagenknecht wrote in these pages.</p>
        <p>ONE HEART, by Jane McCafferty. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.) This first novel explores the lives of two middle-aged sisters whose strained relationship changes after they befriend a mysterious 17-year-old girl. '' 'One Heart' builds in somber intensity, leading to insights and resolutions that move far beyond the predictable,'' Paula Friedman wrote here in 1999.</p>
