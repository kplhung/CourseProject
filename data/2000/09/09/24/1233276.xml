        <p>LEE OZLEY, co-author of ''More Than a Motorcycle,'' is an organizational consultant who has worked with Harley-Davidson since 1987.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ozley helped Rich Teerlink, his co-author and Harley-Davidson's former chief executive, transform the company into one in which workers, rather than merely carrying out edicts from above, took responsibility for decisions that were reached by consensus.</p>
        <p>Following are excerpts from a recent conversation with Mr. Ozley.</p>
        <p>FRED ANDREWS</p>
        <p>Q.  Has there been any retreat from worker participation at Harley?</p>
        <p>A.  I do not think it's retreated at all. The level of implementation, as one would expect, has increased. If you view it objectively from the level of activity and shared decision-making and all those things three years ago, it is much higher today.</p>
        <p>Q. Has this technique enabled Harley to make better decisions?</p>
        <p>A. Harley has been able to come to market with more new products in recent years than they've ever been able to do before. This collegial, consensual decision-making involves people early on in the product design, so the manufacturability is thought about at the time of design. People from the plant work very early on with product development to say, ''That's a wonderful design but it's not possible to build it.''</p>
        <p>Q.  Would this way of decision-making serve Harley in bad times as well as good?</p>
        <p>A.  Absolutely. We have to compete in a global marketplace. The issue here is for employees to be committed, versus compliant. Committed employees will deal with whatever comes at them better than those people who in the past relied on one or two people to make decisions and they would salute them for it. In this way of decision-making, you get a much broader base of employees who understand the global competitive situation. They understand costs; they understand why they have to do what they do.</p>
        <p>Q. Does this way of decision-making attract people?</p>
        <p>A. The turnover rate at Harley-Davidson is much, much below the national average for manufacturing.  In the case of the information services department, they are substantially below what you would expect. In fact, they just got an award from an information services magazine -- they were considered the best place to work in the information services field.</p>
        <p>Q.  Is this more difficult because unions are in the picture?</p>
        <p>A.  Frankly, no. The union organizations, when they first hear about this, will be a little bit apprehensive, they will be suspicious. But once they get on board and are active participants in the decision-making process, they can be very, very helpful. They are able to help communicate the need, to marshal the collective will of the workers.  You have two sets of leaders helping the employee get his or her head around what the issues are.</p>
