        <p>Ariane Burgess is a labyrintista, she says, an artist who builds labyrinths according to ancient tradition. On a recent afternoon, she sat in the center of her latest creation, a labyrinth she and neighborhood children are building out of tree stumps and twigs in a vacant lot on 136th Street, and watched a bright green grasshopper jump across its wood chip floor.</p>
        <p>Right now, the labyrinth is just a group of tree stumps arranged in concentric circles. But when it is finished later this year, a clear path between the stumps will lead from he entrance through at least seven winding loops into a long final passage that leads to a central circle. Ms. Burgess hopes the labyrinth will eventually occupy the entire lot between 135th and 136th Street near Willis Avenue.</p>

        <p>Ariane Burgess is a labyrintista, she says, an artist who builds labyrinths according to ancient tradition. On a recent afternoon, she sat in the center of her latest creation, a labyrinth she and neighborhood children are building out of tree stumps and twigs in a vacant lot on 136th Street, and watched a bright green grasshopper jump across its wood chip floor.</p>
        <p>Right now, the labyrinth is just a group of tree stumps arranged in concentric circles. But when it is finished later this year, a clear path between the stumps will lead from he entrance through at least seven winding loops into a long final passage that leads to a central circle. Ms. Burgess hopes the labyrinth will eventually occupy the entire lot between 135th and 136th Street near Willis Avenue.</p>
        <p>The labyrinth is part of a new program designed by Friends, a project of Visiting Nurse Service of New York that serves emotionally disturbed children and their families.</p>
        <p>Friends hopes to place a dozen labyrinths in public spaces in Mott Haven during the coming year, as part of a program called Camino de Paz, or Peace Walk.</p>
        <p>Since July, the group has been taking a portable labyrinth to local street fairs. Next, they were able to secure a site in Brook Park on 141st Street, where Ms. Burgess painted a rainbow labyrinth on a former basketball court. The tree-stump labyrinth in the 136th Street lot is the third.</p>
        <p>Katherine G. Levine, a director of Friends, described labyrinths as a useful meditative tool that can help calm children who are agitated or angry.</p>
        <p>''Mott Haven has a reputation as being a place of violence and a lot of drug dealing,'' she said. ''We thought that if we could get some people to meditate and think about peace, that would lead the rest of the community in that direction.''</p>
        <p>Labyrinths look like mazes, but they have only one entrance and one exit. Walking through one is less a matter of figuring out which way to go and more a matter of giving in to the process of following a path to the center.</p>
        <p>''This is not about getting lost,'' Ms. Burgess explained. ''It's about letting go of that side of ourselves that needs to make sense of things and just connecting the mind and the body.''</p>

        <p>NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MORRISANIA  Correction:  October 22, 2000, Sunday  An article in the Neighborhood Report pages on Sept. 24 about building a labyrinth as a site for meditation on East 136th Street in the Bronx referred incorrectly to Friends Inc., the social service agency that commissioned it. The group is independent and nonprofit, not a project of the Visiting Nurse Service, which provides Friends with a crisis intervention team. The article also referred misstated the involvement of Katherine G. Levine. She is the director of that team, not a director of Friends.</p>
