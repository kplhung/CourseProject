        <p>In the 1976 presidential campaign, Jimmy Carter's supporters were given a cease-and-desist order by Oregon election officials when they started handing out Georgia peanuts to voters. State law prohibits giving gifts of value to a voter, even a gift worth, well, peanuts.</p>
        <p>Brian Boquist, a Republican businessman running for the House in Oregon's Fifth Congressional District, south of Portland, may or may not have known about that little incident. But in any case, his supporters were spotted the other day handing out free emery boards -- 6,000 of them, bought for 9 cents each, including the emblazoned ''Boquist for Congress'' message.</p>

        <p>Election officials are investigating. Mr. Boquist, who is struggling uphill to unseat Representative Darlene Hooley, a two-term Democrat, could be fined $100 if found guilty.</p>
