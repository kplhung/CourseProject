        <p>The United States Patent and Trademark Office has been bursting at the seams with ideas for products and innovations, in a way that is reminiscent of the early part of the last century, according to a Merrill Lynch study.</p>
        <p>''Patent activity has increased substantially in the past two years,'' particularly in technology, electronics and health care, said Lisa Cullen, the analyst who prepared the recently released report.</p>
        <p>Why should investors care? Because knowing who is taking out patents today will signal who the market's darlings will be tomorrow. ''The companies that have pursued research and development aggressively and have patented the results are today's industry leaders,'' Ms. Cullen said. ''As long as those companies continue to search for new ways to apply science and technology to grow their businesses -- in other words, to innovate -- the companies and their shareholders will benefit.''</p>
        <p>The number of patents granted by the patent and trademark office totaled just over 600 per million Americans in 1999, up from an average of 400 to 450 patents per million for most of the 1990's. That was the highest since 1916, when the rate was  500 per million.</p>
        <p>One shift has been geographic. Almost half the patents granted nowadays go to foreign companies, particularly from Japan. Ms. Cullen said that since 1977, the percentage of United States patents granted to Japanese companies more than doubled, to 19 percent of the total, while the percentage going to Americans fell, to 56 percent from 66 percent.</p>
