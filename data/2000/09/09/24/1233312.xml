        <p>Bruce Ehrmann lives in TriBeCa, across from 60 Hudson Street, a 20-story building crammed with telecommunications companies. Ask him to imitate the noise produced by its dozens of generators and air-circulation devices, all needed to maintain the high-tech equipment inside, and he will reply with a long-drawn-out ''Phwoosh!''</p>
        <p>He says the sound is a galling drone that can escalate at any time into a peace-shattering and sleep-depriving racket.</p>
        <p>Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed agrees. She has introduced a bill to tighten the level of allowable noise at 60 Hudson and the city's other commercial buildings.</p>
        <p>The bill would change the way the Department of Environmental Protection determines which buildings are too noisy. Now, the department can fine a business for each  piece of equipment that causes more than 45 decibels -- light street traffic is about 60 decibels -- to reach neighboring dwellings.  Under the bill, the department could levy a fine if the sound produced by all of a business's units measured together exceeded that level. Fines range from $130 to $4,200.</p>
        <p>Ms. Freed said that the change would force businesses with noisy equipment to upgrade their mufflers and swiftly fix broken fan belts and other problems.</p>
        <p>But Robert Getreu, a spokesman for GVA Williams Real Estate, which manages 60 Hudson, said Ms. Freed's amendment would scapegoat businesses for the generally raised noise levels in revived areas.</p>
        <p>''It would be a tragedy to create legislation that puts major taxpayers in the city of New York out of business,'' he added, referring to M.C.I., Sprint and other tenants at 60 Hudson.</p>
        <p>But those tenants may soon have to deal with a new regulation. Ms. Freed's amendment has won support from Mayor Giuliani and Community Board 1 in Lower Manhattan. Moreover, Councilman Stanley E. Michels, chairman of the council's environmental protection committee, is a co-sponsor. Ms. Freed said she expected the committee and the full Council to pass the amendment, all within the next few months.</p>
