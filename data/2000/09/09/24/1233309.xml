        <p>A small battle is being staged just north of Lincoln Square, and in it David hopes to hawk newspapers and Goliath wears a bustier.</p>
        <p>David is played by Shadur Nabi, a Bangladeshi immigrant who wants to build a newsstand on the west side of Broadway between 67th and 68th Streets. Goliath is Victoria's Secret, the lingerie giant that wants to open what would be its largest store on the same block without an obscured view of its famous skimpies. The store, which would provide more than 26,000 square feet of space, would open before Christmas.</p>
        <p>West Side residents often complain that there are too many newsstands too close together and that they pay too little for their space. (Though building a newsstand costs approximately $20,000, an annual license costs only $1,000.) But in this fight the local community board is rooting for Mr. Nabi because it says his 9-foot-by-6-foot design is cleaner and classier than those it has opposed in the past.</p>
        <p>''His newsstand was so much nicer than the tin boxes most people want to put up,'' said Andrew Albert, a board member. ''We also saw him as a small entrepreneur, and we wanted to help him.''</p>
        <p>On Sept. 5, Community Board 7 approved Mr. Nabi's request, but because there was no quorum the decision will be revisited at the Oct. 3 meeting. In the meantime, lawyers for Victoria's Secret, which has five other stores in the city, are letting their objections be known to board members; though despite repeated calls, company officials would not comment.</p>
        <p>Robert S. Bookman, Mr. Nabi's lawyer, said the company's concerns were understandable.</p>
        <p>''It's rare that the adjacent building owners don't object,'' Mr. Bookman said. ''But the public sidewalk is public.'' He added, ''Maybe if we offer to carry their catalog, they won't object.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nabi said he still hoped a happy compromise can be found.</p>
        <p>''I've worked at so many newsstands,'' he said, ''but now I feel better about owning my own. There's plenty of room for me.''</p>
