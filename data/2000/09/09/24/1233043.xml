        <p>Sanford Kluger letter notes Andrew Sullivan omitted the Harrison family in his September 3 column on political families (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Sullivan omits reference to the Harrisons (William Henry, the grandfather, and Benjamin, the grandson) who also served in the presidency. Furthermore, the history of dynastic succession that he laments (at least with reference to the office of the president) does not support his contentions. The Adamses as well as Benjamin Harrison were all defeated for re-election. And Robert Taft, the son of William Howard Taft, while serving long in the Senate, was never able to translate his family connections into even a nomination for president, although he sought it more than once. It would seem that the American electorate is quite capable of deciding on electoral outcomes based on factors other than nepotism.</p>
