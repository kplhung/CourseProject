        <p>The year was 1936, and President Roosevelt, Governor Lehman and Mayor La Guardia, along with 7,500 guests, had turned out to lay a cornerstone at Brooklyn College, a W.P.A. project that was under construction on a graceful ivy-covered campus in the heart of Midwood.</p>
        <p>But amid all the brass bands and hoopla, no one recorded the fact that a time capsule had been interred inside another cornerstone, in Boylan Hall, the college's Georgian-style administration building.</p>
        <p>The capsule and its contents, which were discovered two years ago, were revealed, to slightly less fanfare, on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''We knew nothing about the box,'' said Christoph M. Kimmich, president of Brooklyn College, who presided over a faculty meeting at which the box's contents were revealed. ''There was no record of it in our archives or newspapers of the time.</p>
        <p>''This ties us very closely to our illustrious past,'' he added, ''and I am moved by the fact that, in the 1930's, in the depth of the Depression, the president, governor and mayor invested in higher education.''</p>
        <p>Among the contents of the time capsule were a special copy of The New York Times (printed on rag, for preservation) dated Oct. 29, 1936. It included a five-column headline about F.D.R.'s campaign sweep through the city and the murmurs of war in Europe. One headline blared, ''Goering Defiant of Foreign Fist.'' On page 20 was a detailed account of Roosevelt's visit, under the headline ''President Hails Brooklyn College --  Wishes It 'the Fine Future It Deserves.' ''</p>
        <p>Next came two checks from the City of New York's Department of Finance, one for $221,800 for the 45 acres of property, and another for $25,528.86 for tax transfers. There were also photographs of the 1936 ceremonies and some 1936 coins.</p>
        <p>Most intriguing was the ''College Bulletin: Courses for 1936-1937,'' which listed just one class in sociology and two in anthropology. But there was an entire Department of Hygiene, designed to teach ''general hygiene, constructive and defensive types.'' Among its offerings was a course called ''Group and Intergroup Hygiene: Application and Principles of Hygiene in and by Social and Political Units.''</p>
