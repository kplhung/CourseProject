        <p>To the Editor: Susan Allen Toth's article ''A Foot in Two Countries,'' (Aug. 27), about the Channel Islands, was much needed for American travelers but missed some attractive and important sites. A few years ago I took a garden tour that included Guernsey and Sark.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Susan Allen Toth's article ''A Foot in Two Countries,'' (Aug. 27), about the Channel Islands, was much needed for American travelers but missed some attractive and important sites. A few years ago I took a garden tour that included Guernsey and Sark.</p>
        <p>On Guernsey, Ms. Toth glosses over Victor Hugo's home in exile, Hauteville House, with its extraordinary yet sumptuous decor. Many furnishings were the spoils of privateering: sections of woodwork and paneling; cabinets, sideboards and seats; tapestries, china, bric-a-brac..</p>
        <p>Our tour group enjoyed a nature walk along the cliffs in Forest Parish with a naturalist guide, and the  wildflowers were unforgettable. We also visited huge greenhouses of roses and carnations. Ms. Toth mentions Sausmarez woodland garden. But more interesting is a guided  tour of the manor itself, where one sees, among other things, King James II's wedding attire and the original log of a rich treasure-collection voyage.</p>
        <p>Guernsey's capital of St. Peter was covered but it is also a huge yacht and marine center, reminiscent of Newport, R.I. -- with a historic fort overlooking it.</p>
