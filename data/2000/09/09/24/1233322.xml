        <p>For years, New Yorkers have complained about helicopter noise to just about anyone who would listen. Right now, they have the attention of the federal government, and rattled residents living near helicopter routes are giving officials an earful.</p>
        <p>Last spring, Congress authorized financing for the Federal Aviation Administration to study the effects of nonmilitary helicopter noise on densely populated areas. The study includes taking 24-hour decibel readings around the city and soliciting public comment. The study was proposed by Representative Carolyn Maloney, who said her office had received many complaints her district, which includes parts of Queens and the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>Unlike fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters do not come under air traffic control. They operate under ''visual flight rules,'' with no stated minimum altitude. There are no required routes, only ''recommended'' paths that pilots follow voluntarily, though not exclusively, critics say. The F.A.A. does not even keep track of the number of helicopter flights in the metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>''This study is badly needed,'' Ms. Maloney said. ''It is the first step toward bringing greater regulation to the helicopter industry.'' She said much of the traffic came from ''superfluous flights carrying tourists, business people or news crews.''</p>
        <p>She said helicopter noise had increased 23 percent over Manhattan since 1991, adding that the number of helicopters crisscrossing the skies was also creating a serious safety hazard.</p>
        <p>Statistics kept by the city on helicopter flights include only operations that take off or land at a city heliport. Those numbers have declined in recent years, mostly because some sightseeing companies have moved to heliports outside the city, though they still fly over New York on most tours.</p>
        <p>Residents have until Oct. 20 to file their concerns about helicopter noise with the F.A.A., which has twice extended the deadline for comment. Among those expressing their views were Sheila and Irwin Susskin of Brooklyn Heights.</p>
        <p>''There are too many flights, every few minutes, all day, every day,'' they wrote. ''They are a burden to the many while a benefit to the few.'' They proposed establishing a minimum altitude of 2,500 feet and lower speed limits. They also called for an end to sightseeing tours.</p>
        <p>Ms. Susskin pointed out that Brooklyn Heights, because of its geography, is a favorite short cut for corporate helicopter pilots coming up the East River.</p>
        <p>''You can see them coming up from the harbor,'' she said. ''And instead of following the bend in the river, and staying over water, as is the recommended route, they fly right over our house at very low altitudes.''</p>
        <p>Arlene Salac, an F.A.A. spokeswoman, said she could not comment on any proposed changes until the study was completed, in March.</p>
