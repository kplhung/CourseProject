        <p>EVERY year from May to October, thousands of state residents are infected with debilitating, potentially fatal tick-associated diseases. And although Lyme disease is the most well-known, there are other illnesses that have made a relatively new appearance in the state.</p>
        <p>''Everyone is concerned about West Nile virus,'' said the state entomologist, Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli, vice director of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. ''But state residents are losing sight of the facts. There has not been a single case of West Nile in Connecticut. There are thousands of confirmed cases of tick-associated disease in Connecticut every year.''</p>
        <p>State epidemiologists estimate that there will be 3,500 cases of Lyme disease in Connecticut this year. But in 1994, scientists first detected Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis, a serious, potentially fatal disease that destroys white blood cells. In just six years, H.G.E. has become the second most common tick-borne illness in the state, with two deaths attributed to the disease.</p>
        <p>By mid-August there were 44 confirmed cases of H.G.E. this year and 240 probable cases of H.G.E., according to state public health records.</p>
        <p>Many people who are infected with H.G.E. require hospitalization, Dr. Magnarelli said. Symptoms include severe headache, high fever, nausea and vomiting, severe muscle and joint pain. Antibiotics are effective against H.G.E. as they are against Lyme disease.</p>
        <p>''Fatalities due to H.G.E. are rare,'' he said, ''but H.G.E. can complicate other medical problems in some people because it attacks and diminishes peoples' immune systems.'' In addition to H.G.E. and Lyme disease, there will be as many as 50 cases of babesiosis, another tick-borne disease spread by the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis), the same tick that infects people with Lyme disease and H.G.E.</p>
        <p>Then there's the American dog tick, which infects an average of four people in Connecticut a year with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Scientists are investigating other diseases that are believed to be borne by the lone star tick, which was found in Fairfield County in 1995, Dr. Magnarelli said. He said scientists suspect that the tick, which is prevalent in the South, carries a bacteria similar to H.G.E.</p>
        <p>''Tick-associated diseases are an increasing public health danger for state residents,'' he said. ''The prevalence of these tick-associated diseases is the result of the reforestation of the state, which has resulted from the abandonment of agriculture. It is caused by large populations of animals such as white-footed mice and deer, which serve as hosts for ticks and reservoirs of infection for tick-borne pathogens.</p>
        <p>He said it is also the result of the ease of travel around the world, which can bring new species of ticks into the state, and residential development and the use of recreational areas in the woods, which keep people in close proximity to the habitats of ticks and animals.</p>
        <p>In 1988, babesiosis, a protozoan parasite that infects red blood cells and produces symptoms very similar to malaria, appeared in Connecticut. Most of the state residents who have become ill have been elderly people who do not have a spleen or whose immune system is impaired in other ways, or have other health problems, said Matthew L. Cartter, epidemiology program coordinator for the Connecticut Department of Public Health. Babesiosis is believed to have contributed to the death of several elderly state residents.</p>
        <p>Babesiosis was thought to be concentrated on off-shore islands and in New London and Middlesex counties, said Dr. Magnarelli. But there is evidence that it is in inland areas of Connecticut as well as Westchester and Duchess counties in New York.</p>
        <p>But the babesiosis rate of infection appears to have stabilized. In 1996, 48 cases of babesiosis were reported in the state. That fell to 31 in 1997, rose to 54 in 1998, then fell to 42 last year.</p>
        <p>''There appears to be a limited number of people who are susceptible to babesiosis,'' Dr. Magnarelli said. ''But healthy persons are susceptible to H.G.E. The rate of infection for H.G.E. will probably not stabilize, as babesiosis has. But H.G.E. will probably not become as common a tick-borne infection as Lyme disease. The deer tick is able to transmit H.G.E. for a much shorter time than it can transmit the Lyme disease organism.''</p>
        <p>He said that when a tick-borne bacteria has the right conditions to infest an area, there is a possibility other species will also be affected.</p>
        <p>The bacteria that causes Lyme disease has been found in mosquitoes, he said. But there is no evidence that mosquitoes are efficient hosts or transmitters of the bacterium. In Europe, West Nile virus has been found in ticks. But in Connecticut there is no evidence the virus is in ticks or whether local species of ticks can host and transmit the virus.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cartter said that when Lyme disease was first detected in Lyme and Old Lyme in 1975 something very similar happened as what is now happening with West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>''Like tick-borne diseases, West Nile virus will be a long-term public health concern in Connecticut requiring vigorous, ongoing monitoring, surveillance, research and treatments by the public health and medical communities,'' he said.</p>
