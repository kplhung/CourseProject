        <p>THIS is the logic of politicians when they think about popular culture: Many of today's films and music and video games are vile, not like the John Wayne movies or Elvis records they enjoyed when they were young.</p>
        <p>More than 80 percent of American adults tell pollsters they think the violence in the culture contributes to violent acts by young people.</p>
        <p>Even though the evidence of a relationship between culture and actual violence is highly uncertain, it is good politics to wax indignant about entertainment corrupting the nation's youth.</p>
        <p>Of course, the First Amendment makes if almost impossible to draft a law that would place meaningful restrictions on the entertainment. Freedom of speech is sacrosanct, and any real crackdown on entertainment would amount to an extension of regulation from Washington, something the Republicans especially deplore.</p>
        <p>Besides, the entertainment industry is a big source of campaign money for both major parties, and especially for Democrats. As of early August, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan watchdog group, people and companies in the industry had donated $23.7 million to candidates and parties for this year's federal elections, 61 percent of it to Democrats. By Election Day, the total will doubtless be much larger.</p>
        <p>So what is likely to come out of Congress this year is the same thing it has produced  almost every other time the evils of popular culture have become a political issue. Whether the entertainment in question was peep shows (turn of the 20th century) or gangster movies (1930's) or comic books (1950's) or disco (1970's), the result was always a lot of hot air and no consequential legislation.</p>
        <p>Last week the Senate Commerce Committee approved a bill that would prohibit the broadcast of television shows with violence in the daytime or early evening, when children could be expected to be watching. Under the legislation, the Federal Trade Commission would define what was violent.</p>
        <p>The debate gave the senators a fine opportunity to sound off. But it is a sure bet that the bill will never become law. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is the Commerce Committee chairman, explained why: ''The notion of letting five unelected bureaucrats at the commission decide what can be broadcast and when it can be broadcast is objectionable to most free people.</p>
        <p>''And for good reason: it is impossible to prospectively define what constitutes 'violent' programming in a way that will not prohibit the transmission of 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Schindler's List,' for example. A telecast featuring murder, suicide, gang violence and knife fighting is violent, but does anyone want the F.T.C. to ban the broadcast of 'Romeo and Juliet'? Parents, not bureaucrats, should decide whether children should be exposed to Shakespeare or even, for that matter, arguably violent cartoons about coyotes and roadrunners.''</p>
        <p>Senator McCain, incidentally, voted ''present.'' If he had voted against the bill, some political opponent someday would surely have used it against him.</p>
        <p>Even if by some fluke of politics the bill were to be passed and signed by the president, the Supreme Court would almost certainly declare it unconstitutional. Just last May, the court struck down a law that required cable systems to limit sexually explicit channels to late-night hours, on the ground that the law violated the basic principle of free speech.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, when the F.T.C. reported that the vast majority of adult-rated films, recordings and electronic games were being advertised to appeal to children, Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, his running mate, suggested that if the entertainment companies did not voluntarily clean up their act, the commission should move against the industry by using its power to prohibit false and deceptive advertising.</p>
        <p>That also might not pass constitutional muster, said William Van Alstyne, a First Amendment expert at Duke University Law School. Mr. Van Alstyne observed, for example, that children under 17 were allowed into R-rated movies if accompanied by an adult. So moviemakers were on firm legal and ethical ground when they aimed ads for movies at children in the hope that they would persuade their parents to take them.</p>
        <p>Politicians are not completely powerless, however. They can hector, threaten and badger the industry, or, to use the Yiddish word that Senator Lieberman used last week, ''noodge'' it into doing a better job of policing itself.</p>
        <p>This has sometimes worked in the past. Arm-twisting by lawmakers led the movie studios in the 1960's to introduce the current rating system. While not perfect, it gives parents some idea of a film's content and gives theaters grounds for turning children away from inappropriate movies.</p>
        <p>In a similar vein, Lynne V. Cheney, whose husband is the Republican vice presidential nominee, suggested that political pressure could induce music companies to include written lyrics with their recordings so parents could see what their children were listening to.</p>
        <p>William J. Bennett, the education secretary in the Bush administration who offers himself as a guardian of American moral values, believes the strongest weapon politicians have is their ability to inflict public shame. In that context, the Commerce Committee has called executives of the large movie studios to testify on Wednesday and say publicly what, if anything, they intend to do to limit children's exposure to violent entertainment.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, then, self-regulation by the industry is probably the politicians' only recourse to objectionable content. But there may be a price to even voluntary censorship -- a diminution of the country's artistic energy.</p>
        <p>In the 1930's, the film studios adopted a voluntary code of conduct in which they agreed not to portray gangsters (James Cagney or Edward G. Robinson) as heroic, police officers as corrupt or loose women (Jean Harlow) as happy -- the notion being that children would not learn from the movies that crime pays or that there is value in promiscuity.</p>
        <p>As a consequence, ''the movies lost some of their bite,'' said Francis G. Couvares, an authority on movie censorship who is now dean of freshmen at Amherst College. ''The rules blunted these electric and dynamic characters who defied social values and limited the capacity of some great actors.''</p>
