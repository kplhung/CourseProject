        <p>An article last Sunday about construction projects of the City University of New York referred imprecisely to its founding. Voters approved a referendum to establish what became City College in 1847; the first students enrolled in 1849.</p>
        <p>The article also omitted the names of the architectural firms that designed the addition for Brooklyn College library. They were Buttrick White &amp; Burtis of New York City and Shepley Bulfinch Richardson &amp; Abbott of Boston. The article also misspelled the name of a building being renovated at Queens College. It is Powdermaker Hall, not Powdermacher.</p>
