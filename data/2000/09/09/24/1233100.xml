        <p>WHEN the DuPont Company said in early 1999 that it was selling three of its buildings, about 10 percent of the city's office space, the announcement shook the community to its industrial foundations. But a vibrant economy has helped smooth the transition.</p>
        <p>The $25 million sale of the three headquarters buildings -- known as the Nemours, Brandywine and Tatnall buildings -- to a development partnership had some residents of this company town wondering whether the mainstay citizen for almost a century was packing up.</p>
        <p>The sale capped a decade of real estate divestiture by E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, the country's largest chemical concern. As the company strives to reinvent itself for the 21st century, in part as a global life sciences business, real estate investments are not felt to be the best use of corporate assets said William A. Sullivan, a former real estate manager at DuPont. All that remains in DuPont's real estate portfolio of its headquarters complex is the DuPont Building, built in stages beginning in 1906 and one of the country's earliest multipurpose buildings, with restaurants, theater, hotel, shops and offices.</p>
        <p>''It makes sense from a business point of view for DuPont not to have such a large headquarters, but for the city it's sad,'' said Carol E. Hoffecker, a historian and the author of ''Corporate Capital: Wilmington in the Twentieth Century.'' ''It seems like such a dramatic symbol of the company's changing relationship with the community.''</p>
        <p>But with more than half of a $100 million redevelopment of the buildings completed and DuPont leasing back a big part of the Brandywine Building, city promoters see the divestiture as a necessary regeneration. At a million square feet, City Center @ Wilmington, as the project is called, is by far the largest redevelopment of office space in the city's history.</p>
        <p>With a New Economy name, City Center will add 100,000 square feet of retail space, 890,000 square feet of Class A office space, 75 apartments and 674 parking spaces to the city. ''It's brought in new blood, new capital and DuPont stayed,'' said William C. Wyer, managing director of the Wilmington Renaissance Corporation, an economic development group made up of city officials and top business leaders.</p>
        <p>From a leasing standpoint, the timing could not be better. Tenants have been having difficulty getting big blocks of space, said Daniel R. Reeder, a senior vice president at CB Richard Ellis in Wilmington. The city's overall downtown vacancy rate is 5 percent, but it drops to 4 percent for Class A space -- large newer buildings with amenities and in good locations.</p>
        <p>Because plans call for a retail and residential mix, City Center is expected to transform 11th Street.</p>
        <p>For decades, this main thoroughfare from Interstate 95 to the downtown's Rodney Square has been without significant public spaces other than the Hotel du Pont and the center lobby of the Nemours Building. Office workers did not have to go outside since the buildings are connected by underground tunnels. This led architects to criticize Wilmington for its lack of human scale.</p>
        <p>''It's big, cold stuff,'' said Charles M. Weymouth, owner of Weymouth Architects and Planners in Wilmington. ''There's no relief, no landscaping, just the repetitiveness of windows, one floor to the next.''</p>
        <p>Adding colorful awnings and flags, huge landscape planters and lighting will make the area feel more hospitable, said Robert E. Buccini, a partner in Wilmington's Buccini/Pollin Group, which signed the deal with DuPont. Barrow Street Capital L.L.C., a private New York real estate investment company, is providing the financing.</p>
        <p>The 75 apartments in a section of the Nemours Building should also go a long way toward making Wilmington a round-the-clock city, Mr. Sullivan said.</p>
        <p>The 18-story Brandywine Building, built in 1972 on a triangular plot, was the first to be renovated as offices. Kling Lindquist of Philadelphia, the original designer of the D-shaped building, was hired as project architect.</p>
        <p>CITY CENTER was given a boost at the start when DuPont agreed to take 266,000 square feet for 10 years in the Brandywine Building, which is still topped by DuPont's oval logo, in neon. Last month, the company moved 649 people into the renovated space. Several law firms have signed leases on remaining space, including Young, Conaway, Stargatt &amp; Taylor.</p>
        <p>A steakhouse is expected to open this fall in space that was formerly a bank branch. The steakhouse, to be called the Vault, is operated by two restaurateurs who opened a Mediterranean restaurant at Market Street Mall in Wilmington last year.</p>
        <p>It will have dining room seating for 115, a bar with space for live entertainment and a mezzanine lounge with seating for 30. There will also be tables for outdoor dining between the Brandywine and Nemours Buildings.</p>
        <p>Investors in the restaurant include Charles M. Cawley, head of MBNA America Bank, a giant credit card bank that moved its headquarters to Wilmington in the early 1990's, as well as two other top MBNA executives. The investment is a message not lost on a city accustomed to being dominated by DuPont.</p>
        <p>While DuPont was selling off buildings in the 1990's and cutting its work force, MBNA put up five buildings on the northeast side of Rodney Square and employs thousands there. ''I think it certainly has demonstrated very powerfully the transformation Wilmington has been undergoing from a DuPont to MBNA town,'' Ms. Hoffecker said.</p>
        <p>The third building that DuPont sold -- the Tatnall Building on 11th Street, across from the Brandywine Building -- was demolished to make way for a parking garage. DuPont had used the 90,000-square-foot building as a mail center.</p>
        <p>Tunnels will be available to Nemours and Brandywine tenants, while a sky bridge that connects Nemours Building to the DuPont Building will be torn down for security reasons, Mr. Buccini said.</p>
        <p>Now the developers have turned their attention to perhaps the toughest part of the project, the 14-story Nemours Building, built in stages from 1935 to 1942. Earlier this month, the Buccini/Pollin Group began gutting the 600,000-square-foot building.</p>
        <p>The Juniper Financial Corporation, a four-month old Internet financial services company founded by several former executives at the Bank One Corporation, has already leased 65,000 square feet. The traditional hallways lined with marble and individual office doors will give way to open floors that characterize the information age.</p>
        <p>An apartment wing will be carved out of 124,000 square feet on the corner facing 10th and Orange Streets. It will have its own entrance lobby separate from the office lobby. Up to half of the 75 apartments could be leased for corporate use, with DuPont agreeing to lease eight apartments.</p>
        <p>The floor plans call for studios to two-bedroom units. Rental rates for the apartments will be firmed up nearer the opening in 2001, but a one-bedroom apartment is expected to cost approximately $1,000 a month.</p>
        <p>Part of the plan is to have the Hotel du Pont supply room service, dry-cleaning pickup and other amenities for apartment dwellers.</p>
        <p>The hotel will also cater to office tenants. A small auditorium in Nemours could be converted to a movie theater, Mr. Buccini said. Negotiations are under way for a first-floor restaurant in Nemours.</p>
        <p>The developers decided not to rename the buildings, believing their DuPont heritage was an important part of the city's history. Indeed, three du Pont cousins -- Alfred I., Pierre S. and T. Coleman -- single-handedly transformed the city from an aging industrial hub to an office center when they made the decision in 1904 to build the company headquarters in Wilmington rather than in New York or Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>As the major shipbuilding and railroad-car manufacturing industries waned, the du Pont cousins built a new business that earned Wilmington the name Chemical Capital of the World.</p>
        <p>''Wilmington has been fortunate that when one of its Old Economy businesses has been on the rocks, something new comes along,'' Ms. Hoffecker said.</p>
