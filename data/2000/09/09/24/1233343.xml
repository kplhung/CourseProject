        <p>A FEDERAL judge in Texas gave gun groups a startling victory last year and set off an appeals battle that legal experts say could be the most important dispute over the Constitutional right to firearms in recent memory.</p>
        <p>The judge, Sam R. Cummings, held that history proves that the right ''to keep and bear arms'' in the Second Amendment gave individual citizens a right to weapons. His decision, with its emotional resonance for gun supporters, was in conflict with the vast weight of modern rulings, which have held that the amendment merely gave the states a right to keep armed militia units.</p>
        <p>The judge dismissed gun possession charges that had been filed against Timothy Joe Emerson, a doctor in San Angelo, Tex. Prosecutors appealed and the case is awaiting a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans, which heard arguments in June.</p>
        <p>Friend-of-the-court briefs were filed by more than 50 groups on every side of the issue, presenting the judges with a fierce historical debate about what the nation's founders meant when they wrote, ''A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'' The following excerpts reveal sharply different readings of the Founding Fathers' comments.</p>
        <p>WILLIAM GLABERSON</p>
        <p>The Second Amendment can be understood, lawyers on all sides argue, by examining the intentions of James Madison, the primary drafter of the Bill of Rights. But the lawyers -- and historians -- don't agree on what Madison meant.</p>
        <p>Madison drafted the Bill of Rights with the aid of innumerable suggestions from his countrymen, most commonly in the form of the state bills of rights and the hundreds of amendments suggested by the state conventions that ratified the Constitution. . . .</p>
        <p>The Bill of Rights was thus infused from the bottom up with the dominant ideology of the day. The common theme running through these state conventions which took place in the spring and summer of 1788 was the clear and unequivocal understanding that the right to keep and bear arms belonged to ''the people'' independent of ''the state.''</p>
        <p>For example, in the New Hampshire convention held on June 21, 1788, the delegates adopted the following language: Congress shall never disarm any citizen, unless such as are or have been in actual rebellion.</p>
        <p>These provisions recollect the spirit at the time when the Constitution was adopted which was the simple recognition that ''the people'' have liberty to keep and bear arms to fulfill various individual needs, including self-defense.</p>
        <p>-- The Second Amendment Foundation, a group that promotes the right to firearms</p>
        <p>Following common usage, the framers of the Second Amendment used the phrase ''bear arms'' to refer to possession of weapons for military use. . . . The best evidence for the Second Amendment meaning of ''bear arms'' is in the original draft of the Amendment proposed in the First Congress by James Madison: ''The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well-armed, and well-regulated militia being the best security of a free country: but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.''</p>
        <p>In . . . the conscientious objector provision, Madison clearly used the phrase ''bearing arms'' to refer solely to the possession of weapons for military use. . . .</p>
        <p>Madison's use of the phrase ''bear arms'' to refer to military activities is echoed in other contemporary usages. . . . Records of debates in the Continental and U.S. Congresses between 1774 and 1821 [include] 30 uses of the phrase ''bear arms'' or ''bearing arms'' (other than in discussing the proposed Second Amendment); in every single one of these uses, the phrase has an unambiguously military meaning. . . .</p>
        <p>If the Second Amendment had been adopted as originally drafted by Madison, its scope would unmistakably be limited to the possession of weapons for use in the militia.</p>
        <p>As it happened, Congress removed the conscientious objector clause, but this deletion should not change our understanding of the remaining language.</p>
        <p>-- Ad Hoc Group of Law Professors and Historians, 52 scholars urging the reversal of Judge Cummings's ruling</p>
        <p>Patrick Henry, the Virginia orator who opposed the Constitution because he feared a strong central government, said access to arms was a key to liberty. But the meaning of his words may depend upon which of his words are quoted.</p>
        <p>The right of the individual to keep and bear arms was closely associated by the framers with the militia tradition that the American colonists brought with them from England. Many Americans of the late eighteenth century were mistrustful of standing armies, and the Federalists and Anti-Federalists were agreed on at least one fundamental point: liberty was more secure on these shores than in England because the American people were armed. . . .</p>
        <p>Patrick Henry . . . proclaimed: ''The great object is that every man be armed. . . . Everyone who is able may have a gun.''</p>
        <p>-- National Rifle Association</p>
        <p>Henry . . . did state that ''[t]he great object is, that every man be armed.'' But Henry went on to note, as [Judge Cummings] neglects to mention: ''But we have learned, by experience, that, necessary as it is to have arms, and though our Assembly has, by a succession of laws for many years, endeavored to have the militia completely armed, it is still far from being the case. When this power is given up to Congress without limitation or bounds, how will your militia be armed?''</p>
        <p>When Henry's statement is read in context, it is clear that his goal that ''every man be armed'' was directed toward a successful state militia (in which each militia member had the use of a gun) -- not toward arming members of the public for their individual needs.</p>
        <p>-- Center to Prevent Handgun Violence</p>
        <p>George Mason, a Virginia delegate to the Constitutional Convention who pushed for a Bill of Rights, is another figure quoted by both sides.</p>
        <p>Congress . . . upheld the beliefs of the Framers of our Constitution, who were avid supporters of individual gun ownership and its protection under the Second Amendment. Many of them also detailed the value of individual firearm ownership toward the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia. . . . These same Framers feared the destruction of the general militia. . . . Some of the Framers' statements include:</p>
        <p>. . . ''I ask, Who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers.'' George Mason, June 16, 1788. . . .</p>
        <p>The Framers' intent was to have an armed populace capable of defending themselves from all forms of tyranny.</p>
        <p>-- The Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms</p>
        <p>The district court misinterprets the historical record by basing its holding almost entirely on an equation of the ''militia'' with the public . . . and concluding from that equation that the Framers must have intended that the right to bear arms belong to individual members of the citizenry.</p>
        <p>But the fact that the militia was drawn from the general population -- in other words, that many citizens were eligible for membership -- is entirely different from saying that the militia should simply be indiscriminately equated with the population at large. The district court's failure to understand this distinction is well illustrated by its reliance on a statement by George Mason: ''Who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people.''</p>
        <p>What the district court overlooks, however, is that Mason's discussion continues: ''. . . the militia of the future day may not consist of all classes, high and low, and rich and poor; but they may be confined to the lower and middle classes of the people, granting exclusion to the higher classes of the people. . . . Under the present government, all ranks of people are subject to militia duty.''</p>
        <p>Mason's concern, quite clearly, was that if Congress were permitted full control over the militia, it might grant exemption from military service to federal elites, rather than distributing militia ''duty'' among the people generally. No such concern would be implicated if the Second Amendment conferred a right to bear arms wholly unrelated to militia service.</p>
