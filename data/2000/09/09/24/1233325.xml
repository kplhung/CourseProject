        <p>SOMEWHERE, William Gaddis is smiling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaddis, who died in 1998, brought four acclaimed novels into the world, including ''The Recognitions'' and ''A Frolic of His Own.'' But after last week, his monumental ''J.R.'' comes to mind.</p>
        <p>That's the sprawling comic novel he published in 1975. The book's eponymous antihero, a grubby 11-year-old boy, builds a business empire by wheeling and dealing in penny stocks and bonds from the pay phone at his middle school. Mr. Gaddis described the boy's creed as ''get all you can.'' The novel won the first of the author's two National Book Awards.</p>
        <p>Despite the book's complexity -- and daunting 725-page length -- the message was simple: In an age when corporate executives act like greedy children, greedy children can be corporate executives. At the time, the picaresque J.R. seemed like the stuff of purest fantasy: parable, not prediction.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to Jonathan G. Lebed, the 15-year-old from Cedar Grove, N.J., who made the front pages last week after the Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of an illegal stock manipulation scheme that garnered $272,826. His system? Wheeling and dealing in penny stocks on the Internet in a classic ''pump and dump'' cycle, investigators said. Jonathan was accused of buying thinly traded stocks on his father's brokerage account, touting the shares in online chat rooms (''the most undervalued stock in history'') and then selling them after his rumors nudged the stocks' prices skyward. Jonathan settled with the S.E.C., neither admitting nor denying the accusations. But he did agree to pay back the money he made, with interest.</p>
        <p>The parallels between J.R. and J.L. are compelling, but Jonathan appears to have one-upped his fictional predecessor: where Mr. Gaddis's pint-sized protagonist enlisted a hapless teacher to represent him in his real-world transactions, thanks to the Internet Jonathan was able to eliminate the middleman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaddis knew he was a writer ahead of his time.  But the courtly author, who pecked out his works on a portable Olivetti, would have been stunned by the power of the Internet to enable a teenager to move markets.</p>
        <p>What's the point of writing fiction in a world like this? These are the days of miracles and wonder, as Paul Simon wrote in 1986. We are living closer than ever to the future, having already been 20,000 leagues under the sea and up to the moon. We own personal computers. The Internet has made its way into more than half of America's homes; the geeks did inherit the earth. Open any given newspaper and the day's events outpace most fiction on the weird-o-meter. Scientists at Brandeis University announced last month that they had created robots that design and build other robots. Last May, college-age hackers in Manila sent out a ''love bug'' virus that clogged computer networks around the globe -- a tale straight out of the gritty works of writers like William Gibson, Neal Stephenson and Bruce Sterling.</p>
        <p>In fact, science fiction writers may be feeling the greatest heat. They create literature of escape, but are scrambling to outrun the present. ''The Nasdaq has become America's most important science fiction writer,'' said Mr. Sterling, a novelist who lives in Austin, Tex.</p>
        <p>He says he is not impressed with the Lebed case. The part that's new -- the online element -- is no longer truly new, and the part that's old is ancient. ''A kid ripping people off over the Internet isn't that different from the Artful Dodger ripping people off in Victorian London,'' Mr. Sterling said.</p>
        <p>Writing well about cyberspace is becoming more challenging, he added, precisely because online technology has been so thoroughly adopted by society: ''Cyber is your uncle's job now.''</p>
        <p>The future sure isn't what it used to be. In a recent TV commercial, the actor Avery Brooks (the baritone-voiced captain from the science fiction series ''Deep Space Nine'') says: ''It is the year 2000 and I don't see any flying cars! I was promised flying cars. I don't see any flying cars! Why? Why? Why?'' The answer, he explains, is that we don't need them, since we can get such amazing software from, um, I.B.M. The underlying message: We might be getting the future we need, even if it's not the one we expected.</p>
        <p>Little wonder, then, that science fiction authors are looking in new directions. Mr. Stephenson's influential 1999 novel ''Cryptonomicon'' takes place both in the present and in World War II, where he found rich settings to explore his themes of communication, code making and code breaking. In ''Distraction: a Novel,'' Mr. Sterling's 1999 political satire, the genetically engineered hero (associates refer to his lack of an actual mother or father as his ''personal background problem'') tucks into a Louisiana dinner that's truly nouvelle: a crawfish modified to grow as big as a lobster.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sterling says the coming biotech boom, and the attendant specter of so-called Frankenfoods, gives him reason to believe there's plenty left to write about. ''The bio thing looks a lot rockier than the cyber thing,'' he says. The pleasure in his voice is delicious.</p>
