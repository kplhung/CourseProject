        <p>WHEN Martha Stewart strode into the opening party for Michael Kors's new store on upper Madison Avenue on Thursday, she flashed her calm, confident smile for the cameras. Then she saw Mr. Kors, and suddenly became girlish. ''I just threw these on,'' she said demurely, fingering the multiple strands of pearls she was wearing with a brown leather shirt. She even kicked one leg up and giggled as she pointed to her beige Shantung pants.</p>
        <p>''Leather and pearls always work,'' Mr. Kors said, and Ms. Stewart, seeming pleased that he approved, pressed her way into the crowd.</p>

        <p>WHEN Martha Stewart strode into the opening party for Michael Kors's new store on upper Madison Avenue on Thursday, she flashed her calm, confident smile for the cameras. Then she saw Mr. Kors, and suddenly became girlish. ''I just threw these on,'' she said demurely, fingering the multiple strands of pearls she was wearing with a brown leather shirt. She even kicked one leg up and giggled as she pointed to her beige Shantung pants.</p>
        <p>''Leather and pearls always work,'' Mr. Kors said, and Ms. Stewart, seeming pleased that he approved, pressed her way into the crowd.</p>
        <p>Just an hour earlier, Mr. Kors had stood in the half-empty top floor of the boutique and cracked jokes to quell his nerves. ''Anxious'' isn't a word usually associated with Mr. Kors, a designer favored by the soignee set as much for his triple-ply charm as for his sumptuous classic clothes. Surrounded by racks of creamy leather jackets, red and camel cashmere sweaters and tweed suits, he watched as waiters made rounds with Champagne, but would have only water himself. ''I just know someone's going to be naked in a dressing room soon,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It had been a long week for Mr. Kors, who had shown his spring collection at Bryant Park the previous day and introduced his new women's fragrance, Michael, at Saks Fifth Avenue that very afternoon. On Wednesday, he had been at the store until midnight, feverishly rearranging the windows. ''People were standing on the sidewalk shouting, 'No! Do the black!' '' he said. ''I had instant feedback.''</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Kors was ready to unveil what he called his ''permanent trunk show'' to his best shoppers. Social stars including the Lauders and the Boardmans, and young Hollywood stars like Famke Janssen, Gina Gershon and Lauren Holly, would appear later. Asked to describe his clientele, Mr. Kors said, ''They're sophisticated when they're young, but young in the head when they're older.''</p>
        <p>As if on cue, those very women began to stream in. The retail veteran Ellin Saltzman, larger than life in a bright red suit and slicked-back hair, buzzed over to Mr. Kors and marveled at the makeup at his show. Nina Griscom, wearing a black and white tweed suit with a flouncy black feather collar, borrowed from Mr. Kors for the evening, lit up when she learned they would both be in Paris in November. ''Want to come out and get in trouble with me?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>By 8, the room was clogged with impeccably groomed women with  glowing skin, and Mr. Kors was still manning the door. ''I wasn't planning on doing a receiving line,'' he said. ''I'm going in.'' Not so fast. Young-in-the-head socialites like CeCe Cord, Anne McNally and Helen Lee Schifter (who excitedly announced that she had just placed a big fall order) were awaiting their turn to gush and gossip. Nearby stood Joan Kors, the designer's mother and the party's co-host. She tapped her son on the arm. ''I just love Anne Slater,'' she told him. ''Those glasses are great.''</p>
        <p>At 9, select guests teetered four blocks north in their high heels to have dinner with Mr. Kors at E.A.T.  Mr. Kors settled into his small table and ordered a cranberry and vodka. To his right sat Sigourney Weaver; to his left, a very pregnant Aerin Lauder, who wasn't wearing Kors. ''Unfortunately, I'm so big that the only thing of his I could fit into tonight was his perfume,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Finally relaxed, Mr. Kors regaled his guests, every few minutes shouting above the din, leaning in for emphasis: ''She was literally 140 years old!'' ''I was ready to kill myself!'' ''I'll never eat French fries again!''</p>
