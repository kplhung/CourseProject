        <p>YOU had to look twice, so transformed were her features, but yes, that was Maggie Rizer gliding down the runway at Oscar de la Renta's spring 2001 fashion show on Tuesday. Her eyes, just visible between layers of bright paint, seemed to be spearing onlookers with their gimlet stare.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rizer's glazed perfection, like that of every other model in Mr. de la Renta's show, began at the top, with hair teased and swept off the forehead in a modified pompadour. It extended to those eyes, heavily outlined in shrill blue; the lips, patent-leather slick; and the skin, polished to a marmoreal sheen.</p>

        <p>YOU had to look twice, so transformed were her features, but yes, that was Maggie Rizer gliding down the runway at Oscar de la Renta's spring 2001 fashion show on Tuesday. Her eyes, just visible between layers of bright paint, seemed to be spearing onlookers with their gimlet stare.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rizer's glazed perfection, like that of every other model in Mr. de la Renta's show, began at the top, with hair teased and swept off the forehead in a modified pompadour. It extended to those eyes, heavily outlined in shrill blue; the lips, patent-leather slick; and the skin, polished to a marmoreal sheen.</p>
        <p>The look -- glossy, remote and rigidly controlled -- conjured up the patinated beauties and social icons of the 1960's and early 70's. The lacquered style of Judy Peabody, Isabel Eberstadt and Charlotte Ford Niarchos lives on with a vengeance today in the artfully contrived maquillage of Nina Griscom and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece. It is just as vivid in the current Versace ad campaign, in which a pale blond plutocrat sits forlornly in the vestibule of a spacious Palm Beach villa. And it resides in the well-maintained features of Catherine Deneuve, whose ''Belle de Jour'' character has gone ever so gently to seed in her recent movie ''Place Vendome.''</p>
        <p>Part Stepford wife, part drag queen, part icy society diva, this mannered ideal of beauty suggested in its original heyday a glamour as polished as it was impenetrable. It still does. ''It represents the other end of the semantic of grunge,'' said Paul Wilmot, a fashion publicist, who has seen both extremes come and go in countless incarnations.</p>
        <p>The lacquered look is by no means dominant on the catwalks this season, where lanky ''pool hair'' and subtle paint prevail. But it is easily the most provocative beauty statement, suggesting both compulsion and restraint. ''It represents a kind of sublimated erotic,'' said Harold Koda, curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum. ''Beyond the icy surface is something that has to do with sexual availability -- like Hitchcock's blondes, blue diamonds with a fiery heart.''</p>
        <p>Ubiquitous this fall in fashion ads and editorials, this sultry but disciplined style is also the beauty world's expression of a new formality, evinced of late in peplum suits and structured bags, and in the penchant of Manhattan's bright young things for elaborate dining out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilmot associates the look with soignee evenings spent at fabled Manhattan restaurants like La Cote Basque and La Caravelle, which are enjoying a revival. He also maintains that it denotes an expressly urban beauty, one likely to be embraced by women ''who work and want to look vital and successful.''</p>
        <p>Although it is doubtful that the downtown set will strain to emulate a stylized beauty their mothers disowned, the style does work as hip metaphor.</p>
        <p>''It's very much about a kind of regal composure, about lunch more than dinner, about a certain kind of glacial hospitality,'' said Wayne Koestenbaum, who exhumed and laboriously examined the puffed-out hair and haut bourgeois accouterments of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in ''Jackie Under My Skin'' (1995). ''I do feel this style represents the return of the repressed.''</p>
        <p>Glazed hair and a face to match can also be viewed as an aesthetic corrective, a gauntlet in the face of slatternly, overheated starlet glamour trumpeted as chic in the pages of In Style, Us Weekly and other red-carpet magazines. By contrast, the look of Mr. de la Renta's show ''is a cold beauty,'' said Tom Pecheux, the makeup artist who created it. More important, he noted, its precise and polished quality changes the manner of the woman who wears it. ''She drinks and she eats differently,'' Mr. Pecheux said. Suddenly she has a certain rigor.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because it is so studied and confining, the look was first taken up as an antidote to the prevailing laid-back chic by a group of photographers and performance artists who have influenced fashion. Photographers like Philip-Lorca diCorcia and Tina Barney have examined the style with a mix of revulsion and lurid fascination.</p>
        <p>The two modes also alternate in a current performance by Lypsinka, the cabaret artist, at the Westbeth Theater Center in Greenwich Village. Lypsinka revels in impersonating chanteuses and old-Hollywood divas, wearing a boned bustier and architected hair. But at times she seems desperate to shake off the stiff trappings that define -- and confine -- the characters.</p>
        <p>Malerie Marder, an art photographer whose subjects are hypergroomed upper-middle-class women, also seems both captor and captive of her muse. Her photographs, currently at Lawrence Rubin, Greenberg Van Doren Fine Art, often portray women who appear isolated amid haut bourgeois surroundings.</p>
        <p>Such alienated types, with their not-of-this-world glassiness, exert a powerful pull on some of fashion's youngest devotees. ''These images are dramatic, but they are also frightening,'' Mr. Koda said. ''If they projected a wholesome beauty, a younger generation would find them banal. It's their slightly noirish character which gives them edge.</p>
        <p>''These subjects are not dolls. They are mannequins, and that implies a certain toughness.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, their enameled chic makes them alluring to the newly rich. The hard and glossy look will find its way to a wide popular audience next week in the person of Yasmine Bleeth in the latest Aaron Spelling series, ''Titans,'' which makes its debut on NBC on Oct. 4. As an Internet entrepreneur who has married above her station, Ms. Bleeth vamps it up in crystal-studded Versace, her frosty makeup and backswept hair a cartoonish variation on the familiar genre.</p>
        <p>For countless viewers who identify with her upward-striving character, Ms. Bleeth will doubtless be an avatar of a kind of Champagne and black-pearl stylishness.</p>
        <p>More worldly women, however, might be tempted to identify with one of Ms. Marder's images: a slightly weathered type who stands, immaculately made up, in one corner of her bedroom, while in another, a young man is glimpsed showering off. The woman is pensive, perhaps because her lover is about to leave.</p>
        <p>More likely, though, she is impatient to slip more fully inside her fastidious shell. ''She can't wait,'' suggested Mr. Koda, who has seen the image, ''for her friend to dry off and get going.''</p>
