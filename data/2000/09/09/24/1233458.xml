        <p>Northwestern 47  Wisconsin 44</p>
        <p>Damien Anderson's 12-yard touchdown run in the second overtime gave Northwestern a 47-44 victory over No. 7 Wisconsin yesterday in Madison, Wis.</p>
        <p>''I was probably the least surprised person out of 80,000 here today,'' Northwestern Coach Randy Walker said. ''I expected to win. We don't put a plan together, or prepare or work like we work to do anything but that.''</p>
        <p>The suspension-riddled Badgers saw their 11-game winning streak halted when Anderson scooted around left end and darted into the end zone.</p>
        <p>Vitaly Pisetsky had given Wisconsin (3-1, 0-1 Big Ten) a 44-41 lead with a 39-yard field goal on the first possession of the second overtime.</p>
        <p>Anderson finished with 175 yards on 21 carries for Northwestern (3-1, 1-0). He also scored on a 69-yard run in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>The Badgers completed their National Collegiate Athletic Association-mandated suspensions by sitting out six players against the Wildcats, including their No. 1 receiver, Chris Chambers, and the all-American cornerback Jamar Fletcher. They were among 26 players who got caught receiving unadvertised discounts at a shoe store.</p>
        <p>Michigan 35, Illinois 31</p>
        <p>Anthony Thomas scored on a 3-yard run with less than three minutes left as No. 10 Michigan took advantage of two late fumbles to beat No. 19 Illinois in Champaign, Ill.</p>
        <p>Just before the touchdown, Thomas appeared to fumble near the goal line, but officials ruled he was down. A replay appeared to show otherwise.</p>
        <p>The Wolverines rallied from a 21-7 deficit in the third quarter behind Drew Henson. After missing the first three games with a broken right foot, Henson replaced an ineffective John Navarre at quarterback late in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>Thomas rushed for 228 yards and 2 touchdowns to help the Wolverines (3-1, 1-0 Big Ten) avoid a repeat of last week's close loss at U.C.L.A.</p>
        <p>The Illini (3-1, 0-1) missed a chance at the program's best start since 1951.</p>
        <p>Nebraska 42, Iowa 13</p>
        <p>Eric Crouch threw 5 touchdown passes on 10 completions and also ran for 93 yards as No. 1 Nebraska survived an early scare at home.</p>
        <p>Crouch was 10 of 13 for 159 yards, while Iowa (0-4) matched a school record with its 12th straight loss.</p>
        <p>Dan Alexander ran for 113 yards and Correll Buckhalter had 100 yards for the Cornhuskers (3-0).</p>
        <p>Florida State 31  Louisville 0</p>
        <p>Linebacker Tommy Polley returned an interception 4 yards one touchdown and forced a fumble to set up another as No. 2 Florida State (4-0) extended major college's longest winning streak to 16 games.</p>
        <p>Chris Weinke threw for 221 yards and a touchdown, ran 2 yards for another, but was intercepted three times in Tallahassee, Fla.</p>
        <p>Florida 59, Kentucky 31</p>
        <p>Florida quarterback Jesse Palmer accounted for five touchdowns, four of them rushing to tie a school record, as the third-ranked Gators built a five-touchdown lead and beat visiting Kentucky for the 14th consecutive time.</p>
        <p>Palmer scored on two 1-yard sneaks, an inside bootleg from 14 yards and a quarterback scramble from 13 yards. He also threw a 32-yard touchdown pass during a 49-second scoring burst that gave Florida (4-2, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) control of the game.</p>
        <p>Behind the 275-pound quarterback Jared Lorenzen, who was 35 of 59 for 363 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, Kentucky (2-2, 0-1) piled up 504 yards, the most by any S.E.C. team against Florida since Steve Spurrier took over as coach in 1990.</p>
        <p>Miami 47  West Virginia 10</p>
        <p>Ken Dorsey threw two touchdown passes to Reggie Wayne and No. 12 Miami's defense scored three times at West Virginia.</p>
        <p>Miami (2-1, 1-0 Big East), which allowed 34 points in a loss at Washington two weeks ago, held the Mountaineers to 95 yards in the first half and 317 over all.</p>
        <p>For West Virginia, (2-1, 1-1) quarterback Brad Lewis was just 11 of 31 for 113 yards and Avon Cobourne, the Big East's leading rusher, sat out with a sprained ankle.</p>
        <p>Southern Cal 34  San Jose State 24</p>
        <p>Carson Palmer led a late Southern Cal rally as the No. 9 Trojans scored three touchdowns in the final 8:07. Petros Papadakis bulled 5 yards up the middle for the go-ahead score with 2:34 remaining as host Southern Cal (3-0) came back from a 12-point deficit.</p>
        <p>Palmer, who completed 22 of 38 for 338 yards and 2 touchdowns, threw to Matt Nickels for the 2-point conversion and a 3-point lead over the Spartans (2-2).</p>
        <p>South Carolina 23  Mississippi State 19</p>
        <p>Erik Kimrey threw a 25-yard fourth-quarter touchdown pass on his first play of the game, lifting host South Carolina over No. 25 Mississippi State (2-1, 0-1 S.E.C.).</p>
        <p>The Gamecocks (4-0, 2-0) entered the season with a 21-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>Purdue 38, Minnesota 24</p>
        <p>Drew Brees set Big Ten career records for completions and attempts, throwing for 409 yards and 2 touchdowns for No. 21 Purdue (3-1, 1-0 Big Ten) at home.</p>
        <p>Brees, who was 33 of 49, topped the marks of 797 completions set by Jack Trudeau of Illinois and 1,309 attempts by Mark Herrmann of Purdue.</p>
        <p>Brees has 1,325 attempts, 820 completions, 9,487 yards and 73 touchdown passes in 36 games. He also rushed for a career-high 88 yards, including an 11-yard touchdown for Purdue's final score.</p>
        <p>Clemson 31, Virginia 10</p>
        <p>Quarterback Woodrow Dantzler ran for 220 yards and 2 long touchdowns for No. 11 Clemson (4-0) in Charlottesville, Va.</p>
        <p>Kansas State 55  North Texas 10</p>
        <p>Quarterback Jonathan Beasley scored a school-record five touchdowns for No. 4 Kansas State (4-0) in Manhattan, Kan.</p>
        <p>IN OTHER GAMES</p>
        <p>LaDainian Tomlinson, who entered the game as the nation's leading rusher, ran for 140 yards and 2 touchdowns to lead No. 18 TEXAS CHRISTIAN to a 52-3 victory over visiting ARKANSAS STATE. The Horned Frogs (3-0) have won eight consecutive games. . . .
