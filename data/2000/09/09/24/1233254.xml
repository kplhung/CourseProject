        <p>Alex Yermolinsky of El Cerrito, Calif., won the 101st United States. Open Championship Tournament, held at the Radisson Hotel in St. Paul, Aug. 5-13. He scored 8-1 in the nine-round Swiss system, 505-entrant competition to take the $5,000 first prize.</p>
        <p>Six players finished half a point behind in a tie for second to seventh places with 7 1/2-1 1/2 tallies. They were his fellow grandmasters Gregory Kaidanov and Gregory Serper of the United States, Akeksander Wojtkiewicz of Poland and Pavel Blatny of the Czech Republic and the international masters Larry Kaufman and Michael Valvo of the United States. Each was awarded $1,500.</p>
        <p>An important victory in Yermolinsky's rush to the top was his sixth-round defeat of the Pittsburgh grandmaster Alexander Shabalov, who, like him, was born in the Soviet Union, and later blossomed in America. His achievement was not in violent attack but in the play for delicate positional advantages in the opening and their precise exploitation throughout the resulting endgame.</p>
        <p>The point of 4 . . . Qb6 in the Sicilian Defense is to drive back the developed knight to decrease the chance for a quick attack by White. The best response would have been 5 Nb3 Nf6 6 Nc3 e6 7 Bd3 Be7 8 O-O a6 9 Kh1 with reasonable attacking prospects for White. Instead, unaccountably, Shabalov chose the inferior 5 Nb5?!, and after 5 a6 6 Be3? Qd8 7 Nd4 Nf6 8 Nc3 e5 9 Nf5 d5 10 ed Nb4 11 Ng3 Nfd5 12 Nd5 Qd5 13 Qd5 Nd5, Yermolinsky already had a comfortable endgame.</p>
        <p>Yermolinsky squelched any attempt to menace his e pawn by 19 . . .  O-O-O! If then 20 Be5?, then 20 . . .  Ne5 21 Re5 Bd5! 22 f3? Bg7 23 Re1 Bb2 wins for him. Also, if 20 f4, then 20 . . . Bg7 21 fe Rhe8 22 Kd2 Rd5 23 Re2 Ne5 24 Rae1 Bh6 25 Kd1 Nd3 26 cd Rd3 27 Kc2 Rd6 yields him a winning pawn-ahead endgame.</p>
        <p>After 20 . . . Bh6, Shabalov could still not go for 21 Be5? because 21 . . .  Rd3! 22 cd Bb3 23 Ke2 Ne5 gives Yermolinsky a winning two bishops for a rook and pawn.</p>
        <p>Shabalov tried to get his king out of the center with 21 Ke2 and 22 Kf2, but he wasn't quick enough. After 22 . . .  e4 23 Bf1 Nd4 24 Bd4 Rd4 25 fe Bd2 26 Red1 fe 27 Kg1 Bg4, there was no use playing 28 Be2 Be3 29 Kh1 Be2 30 Ne2 Rd1 31 Rd1 Rf2 32 Ng3 Rc2 because Black will easily win his pawn-ahead ending.</p>
        <p>After 38 . . . Bc6, Shabalov had hung on to material equality, but with his queenside pawns split and the black bishop occupying a commanding diagonal and the white king confined to the first rank, he had no chance of survival.</p>
        <p>After 50 . . . b5, Shabalov had no recourse against the two connected passed queen knight and queen rook pawns. If 51 Rc2, then 51 . . . Kb7 52 Rc6 Kc6 53 Kg2 a2 wins outright for Yermolinsky. Shabalov gave up.</p>
