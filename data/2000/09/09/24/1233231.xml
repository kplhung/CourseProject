        <p>Bige Zeynep Doruk and Ib Ingemann Olsen were married in New York yesterday by the Rev. Orlando R. Brugnola, a Unitarian minister, at the Boathouse in Central Park.</p>
        <p>Ms. Doruk, 34, who will keep her name, is the director of business development in New York for Cephren Inc., an Internet company that sells construction materials online. A graduate of Clemson University, she received a master's degree in mechanical engineering from Texas A&amp;M and an M.B.A. from Harvard University. Her parents, Dr. Birsen Doruk and Dr. Teoman Kaya Doruk, live in Clemson, S.C., where the bride's father, now retired, was a professor of architecture at the university. The bride's mother, who retired as the director of the division of fine arts of Istanbul Technical University in Turkey, is a part-time lecturer and professor of architecture at Clemson.</p>
        <p>Mr. Olsen, 38, is the product engineering manager of Evonyx Inc., which works on battery and fuel cell technology, in Hawthorne N.Y. He graduated with a master's degree in chemical engineering from the Technical University of Denmark in Lyngby and received a doctorate in chemistry from the University of Odense in Denmark. The bridegroom is a son of Birthe and the late Verner Olsen of Nakskov, Denmark. The bridegroom's father was a post office supervisor.</p>
        <p>Before the couple decided to take the plunge, they took a dive. They met last Christmas Eve in the Cocos Islands off Costa Rica, where they were taking a millennium scuba cruise with 18 other people.</p>
        <p>''At home, all my friends were telling me what they were going to do for millennium,'' Ms. Doruk said. ''They told me about the different parties they were going to, and all the guys they would meet. So, I decided simply to do something I wanted to do. And now I am the only one getting married.''</p>
        <p>While their romance moved quickly -- from strangers to an engaged couple in 52 days -- it wasn't smooth sailing all the way. They met for the first time right before the cruise, in a hotel lobby on the mainland, where she was seaching for members of her travel party. Mr. Olsen saw her, told her he was with her dive group and offered to buy her a beer. During the 36-hour boat ride to the diving location, they discovered they had a lot in common.</p>
        <p>''Despite our very different backgrounds, we have overlapping values and overlapping personalities,'' said Mr. Olsen, who was born and raised in Denmark (Ms. Doruk was born in Istanbul). They became dive buddies, watching out for one another as they swam among sharks and barracudas in the Pacific Ocean. An adventure, to be sure, but not necessarily romantic.</p>
        <p>''You are diving three or four times a day,'' Ms. Doruk observed. ''There are people around you all the time, and the sea was rough. People around you are getting seasick. I came back 10 pounds lighter.''</p>
        <p>Yet, they still managed a romantic kiss on New Year's Eve. And by the time they got off the boat, four days into the new millennium, the bride said, ''We knew we were right for each other.'' Mr. Olsen added: ''I can start a sentence and she can finish it and vice versa. It was that way from the beginning.''</p>
