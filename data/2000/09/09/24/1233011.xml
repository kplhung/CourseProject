        <p>Anthropology</p>
        <p>By Dan Rhodes.</p>
        <p>Villard, $18.95.</p>
        <p>The British writer Dan Rhodes's slim first book, ''Anthropology,'' contains 101 stories, each one 101 words long. Whether you think this conceit is gimmicky or clever will depend entirely on whether you find Rhodes's over-the-top riffs about love and relationships amusing. Each vignette is narrated by a hapless man whose lovers are referred to as ''girlfriend'' or some weird name, like ''Foxglove,'' ''Nightjar'' or ''Tortoiseshell.'' Often the tales involve betrayal and humiliation, and through them Rhodes articulates everyone's worst intimacy nightmares. ''At first I didn't mind her puffing out her cheeks to draw attention to my slight weight problem,'' he writes in ''Fun.'' But then the narrator's girlfriend goes on to ''joke in a loud voice about the frequency with which I find myself unable to bring her to pleasure, and how handsome other men are compared to me.'' In ''Open,'' the narrator agrees to an open relationship because he is petrified of losing his girlfriend. ''These days I spend most nights alone on the sofa as she uses our bed to entertain her new boyfriends and girlfriends,'' he says. Rhodes should be commended for his economy of words and his outrageous humor. But after a while, the stories become predictable and the one-note theme -- the irony and agony of relationships -- grows tired. Reading these tales is like sitting at a bar next to a lonely heart who won't stop rattling on about his amorous woes. At first you're sympathetic, then you start to wish he'd go away.</p>
