        <p>After a three-year renovation, Hillwood Museum and Gardens in Washington -- the home of the Postum Cereal Company heiress, Marjorie Merriweather Post (1887-1973) -- will reopen on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>An enthusiastic collector of fine and decorative art, Post bought Hillwood in 1955 and recruited the New York architect Alexander McIlvaine to reconstruct the 36-room Georgian-style mansion overlooking Rock Creek Park as a museum of her treasures.</p>
        <p>Hillwood features a comprehensive collection of 18th- and 19th-century Russian imperial art, which Post began accumulating while living in the Soviet Union with her third husband, Ambassador Joseph E. Davies, during the 1930's. There is also a noteworthy collection of 18th-century French decorative arts. Among the items on display are the crown worn by Empress Alexandra at her marriage to Nicholas II in 1884, some 80 works by Peter Carl Faberge, dozens of Russian icons and numerous pieces of Sevres porcelain.</p>
        <p>The 12 acres of landscaped gardens on the 26-acre estate include a formal French parterre, a circular rose garden and a Japanese-style garden with a waterfall.</p>
        <p>Visitors may also tour a dacha that houses more Russian art objects, and an Adirondack building with American Indian artifacts.</p>
        <p>Hillwood Museum and Gardens, 4155 Linnean Avenue NW, will be open by reservation only, with a limit of 250 visitors a day. Regular hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. The estate is closed Monday and all of February. Guided tours of the house are at 9:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m, and self-guided tours can be taken at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. Guided garden tours are at 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Admission is $10, $8 for age 65 and up, $5 for students and children 6 to 18. Information: (202) 686-850, or on the Internet at www.hillwoodmuseum.org; reservations: (877) 445-5966, fax (202) 966-7846.</p>
