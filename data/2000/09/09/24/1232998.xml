        <p>When Genius Failed</p>
        <p>The Rise and Fall</p>
        <p>of Long-Term Capital Management.</p>
        <p>By Roger Lowenstein.</p>
        <p>264 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Random House. $26.95.</p>
        <p>The rise and fall of Long-Term Capital Management, the multibillion-dollar hedge fund, is a tale of genius and hubris, of sleeping regulators and foolish banks. But most of all, it reflects the limitations of mathematical expertise in dealing with the human beings whose hopes and fears are always reflected in the gyrations of financial markets.</p>
        <p>In ''When Genius Failed,'' Roger Lowenstein, one of the best financial journalists there is, aptly quotes G. K. Chesterton, the English writer who called life ''a trap for logicians'' because it is almost, but not quite, reasonable. ''It looks just a little more mathematical and regular than it is,'' Chesterton wrote. ''Its exactitude is obvious, but its inexactitude is hidden; its wildness lies in wait.''</p>
        <p>It is a fair bet that the men behind Long-Term Capital never read Chesterton. They thought in mathematical terms and relied on computers to find historical relationships between related securities. If those relationships got out of line -- if one security traded for more than it should relative to historical patterns -- they would place bets that prices would get back into line. ''They had programmed the market for a cold predictability that it never had,'' Lowenstein writes. ''They had forgotten the human factor.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, it was a strategy that worked for years at Salomon Brothers, where John W. Meriwether built a team in the 1980's. Then the ideas were new to Wall Street, and the computer power necessary to build the models was just being harnessed.</p>
        <p>Meriwether left Salomon after a scandal involving a government bond trader he supervised. Lowenstein reports that Meriwether might have been able to return to Salomon, but not to the top job he thought he deserved. So he started Long-Term with the best of the team he had built at Salomon, and added two of the pioneers of financial theory: Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton. They would later share the Nobel in economic science for their work in developing the theory of how to price options. Options -- which provide the right to buy shares of stock at a given price for a limited time -- had been around for centuries, but their work provided the fundamental basis for valuing them. They believed markets were rational, and that historical patterns were bound to repeat.</p>
        <p>The academics brought cachet to Long-Term, but it was the traders who dominated it. Lawrence Hillibrand and Victor J. Haghani were young -- in their 20's when they made billions for Salomon and in their early 30's by the time Long-Term Capital began operating -- and they had supreme confidence in themselves and their computer models. Lowenstein, a columnist for Smart Money magazine and author of a book about Warren Buffett, does a masterly job of explaining both the theories that they used and how they made the fund succeed brilliantly in 1995 and 1996, when it made more than 40 percent each year for its investors -- even after the managers took a quarter of the profits, plus 2 percent of the money invested, as fees for themselves.</p>
        <p>Wall Street firms lent money to the fund on incredibly easy terms. They did that because everyone assumed there was no risk and because they hoped that associating with geniuses would give them insights into the fund's strategies. That enabled the fund to borrow so much money that its positions amounted to 30 or more times its capital. It had to do that since the profits from each trade were sure to be small.</p>
        <p>By 1998, however, everyone on Wall Street was operating with similar models, and the profits from each trade were even tinier than before. Long-Term saw that, and seemed to pull in its horns by forcing many of its investors to take much or all of their money out of the fund. Those investors turned out to be the lucky ones, for Lowenstein makes a convincing argument that the strategy that Long-Term then embarked on was doomed to eventual failure.</p>
        <p>The fund's strategy was twofold. First, it increased the amount of money it was borrowing, on the theory that if you make less on each trade, you can make up for that by doing more trades, which requires borrowing a lot more. Second, it branched out. The firm that was supposed to be trading bonds suddently became a big player in stocks, as it placed huge bets on whether announced mergers would be completed. It used derivative securities called equity swaps to make those trades without putting up any significant cash.</p>
        <p>Then in the summer of 1998, everything went wrong. An Asian currency crisis spread and Russia defaulted on its debts. Traders were in a panic, and people in a panic do not trade in the rational way that Merton and Scholes expected. As fear grew, investors sought out the safety of Treasury bonds and avoided bonds with any amount of risk. Stock market volatility soared and takeover stock prices plunged. Every trade that Long-Term had placed had gone wrong. Soon it was losing $100 million a day.</p>
        <p>''The fund was immobilized by its sheer mass. The smaller fish around it were liquidating every bond in sight, but Long-Term was a helpless bloated whale surrounded by deadly piranhas,'' Lowenstein reports. If it tried to sell, it would just depress prices further on its remaining holdings. Meriwether desperately tried to raise money, but by then Wall Street smelled blood and no one wanted to invest in the fund.</p>
        <p>In the end, the Federal Reserve organized a rescue of the fund. Nearly $4 billion was put up by investment banks and commercial banks to stabilize Long-Term. The partners grumbled about being forced to work for only $500,000 a year as the fund wound down, and Meriwether and some of his colleagues started a new hedge fund late last year, vowing to use only $15 or so of borrowed money to go with each dollar invested with the fund. So far, the fund's performance is unspectacular.</p>
        <p>Lowenstein has few kind words for the Federal Reserve or its chairman, Alan Greenspan. ''On balance, the Fed's decision to get involved -- though understandable given the panicky conditions of September 1998 -- regrettably squandered a choice opportunity to send the markets a needed dose of discipline.'' He fears that investors ''in the next problem child'' will assume the Fed will step in and therefore not show needed prudence.</p>
        <p>It is far too early to know what the long-term lessons of the Long-Term saga will be. But it is clear that Wall Street has not learned much. Banks and hedge funds still use complicated derivatives to gain tremendous leverage, just as Long-Term did in placing its ill-fated bets in the stock market. Far from trying to control that, Congress is considering legislation to make such leverage more readily available to ordinary investors.</p>
        <p>That appalls Lowenstein: ''Greenspan's more serious and longer-running error has been to consistently shrug off the need for regulation and better disclosure with regard to derivative products. Deluded as to the banks' ability to police themselves before the crisis, Greenspan called for a less burdensome regulatory regime barely six months after it.'' He complains that Greenspan has supported the banks in efforts to avoid making meaningful disclosures about their investments in derivatives.</p>
        <p>One lesson that should be learned is that there are great limits on what academics can do for investors. There has been a pattern in recent years of professors finding patterns and pronouncing them to be the sure road to wealth. The result is always the same: as investors learn of the professors' findings and begin to follow them, the findings become truer than ever. Eventually, so many people have done it that the strategy is overdone and prices become far too high. Then some shock destroys the academic theory.</p>
        <p>It happened in the early 1980's with the theory that small stocks always produce better returns than large ones. Then it happened with the strategies that Long-Term followed. Now the great theory that investors have learned from academics is that stocks are always the best long-term investment. Believers have sent stock prices to unheard-of valuations. There is no way to know when that theory will be discredited, but you can bet that it will happen.</p>
