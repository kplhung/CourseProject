        <p>ONE of the fine old dwellings that have been demolished on Staten Island was the Edward J. Bonner house, a shingle-style home with Queen Anne elements. The structure was on Bard Avenue near Livingston Court in Livingston.</p>
        <p>It can still be appreciated in the 1947 photograph (shown above), part of the exhibition ''This Old House,'' which opened yesterday at the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences. The show is largely a celebration of houses that have been lost.</p>
        <p>Vintage photographs from the institute's archives show that houses are ''not only the most prominent artifacts on the cultural landscape of Staten Island, but that they are also centers of human activity as well,'' said Vince Sweeney, curator of history at the institute.</p>
        <p>''This Old House'' through Dec. 31, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday, 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday; Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences, 75 Stuyvesant Place, near Wall Street; suggested donation $2.50 adults, $1.50 students and people 62 or older, free for members; (718) 727-1135.</p>
