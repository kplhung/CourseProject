        <p>FOR more than a year now, while factory owners, residents and parishioners of two churches wondered if they would lose their property to make way for an Ikea furniture store, city leaders here have kept their opinions on the project to themselves.</p>
        <p>Time and again Mayor Timothy C. Idoni and members of the City Council have said they would wait until all the data was in before deciding whether building an Ikea superstore alongside I-95 was best for the city.</p>
        <p>Well, the data is in but, everyone seems to agree, it's going to take some time to digest.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to comment yet,'' said Mayor Idoni, who has been sorting through the charts and tables in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement since it was released Sept. 14.</p>
        <p>The mayor is not alone. The project is politically sensitive, and supporters and opponents alike say they need more time to review the document. If the store is approved, it would mean the entire City Park neighborhood, which includes a hodgepodge of 29 businesses, 2 churches and 34 homes would be bulldozed to make way for Ikea.</p>
        <p>The impact statement, which studies the effects that an Ikea store would have on everything from traffic and groundwater to noise and the local economy, is 795 pages long and comes with a CD-ROM, which contains another 7,000 pages. It weighs nine pounds on a bathroom scale. It's so big that the city is charging $200 for each copy (though it is available for reading at the public library and in the city's development office).</p>
        <p>''It's costing us $250 to reproduce it,'' Mayor Idoni said. ''So we're selling it at a loss.''</p>
        <p>The report, paid for by Ikea but prepared by independent consultants, presents a highly favorable picture of the benefits Ikea would bring to this struggling city.</p>
        <p>The store would be a two-story warehouse-style building. It would sit on 14.9 acres, include 1,572 parking spaces and employ 180 part-time and 170 full-time workers, the report says.</p>
        <p>The report projects that Ikea would pay $1.9 million in property taxes annually to the city, the New Rochelle school district and Westchester County and $7.36 million in annual sales taxes, of which $2.3 million would go to New Rochelle and the rest to the state and the county.</p>
        <p>It would bring in 1,729 cars an hour on its busiest sale days but a more modest 183 cars an hour on a typical weekday. Still, the report says that any traffic problems can be eased by reconfiguring roads.</p>
        <p>''The traffic flow at 44 out of 48 intersections included in the study will stay the same or improve if Ikea is built,'' Jim Gdula, the project's manager, said. ''The traffic does work and not just for New Rochelle but also for Mamaroneck and Larchmont.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone is convinced.</p>
        <p>''They are expecting 1,800 cars an hour on sales days,'' said Cheryl W. Lewy, mayor of the neighboring village of Larchmont. ''To say that you can mitigate that kind of traffic with six well-timed traffic lights is a stretch.</p>
        <p>Besides, Ms. Lewy said, plans for the project just keep getting bigger. When the store was first proposed, almost two years ago, it was going to be 265,000 square feet, she said. Somewhere along the way, it added on another 40,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>''It's just a project in the wrong location,'' Ms. Lewy said. ''We wish the city of New Rochelle well. We wish them economic health, but to try and shoehorn a project of this size in there, it's not right.''</p>
        <p>Albert L. Jones, 79, is unconcerned about traffic. After decades of having the New England Thruway for a backyard, he's used to that. He's concerned about having to move at this late stage of life. Mr. Jones, a retired school custodian, said Ikea has offered him $250,000 for his tidy house. It's not a bad sum for a small house on a highway, but Mr. Jones's mortgage is paid off and his taxes are low, and he says his monthly costs are close to nothing.</p>
        <p>''If they wanted to buy me a house and pay the taxes for the next 15 years, fine I'd go,'' Mr. Jones said. ''But I think that's going to cost a lot more than $250,000.''</p>
        <p>The citizens' group Westchester Residents Against Ikea Now is waiting for its own consultants to scrutinize the data in the report.</p>
        <p>''It's very romantic and ridiculous,'' said Laura Lovejoy, a group member. ''The study and indeed the whole project are predicated on the fact that a single-use big box retail development is preferable to the current mixed use or to other mid-size development options.''</p>
        <p>Ikea wants to buy out all the property owners and not have to rely on the city's power of eminent domain to seize the land, Mr. Gdula said.</p>
        <p>In fact, he said, Ikea already has signed contracts giving it ownership of 40 percent of the land in the neighborhood, although some of that includes property that is across the street from the 14.9 acre project. Ikea bought that land, along with some other parcels in New Rochelle, with the hope of relocating some of the businesses from City Park.</p>
        <p>''Whether it's Ikea or somebody else, this area is slated for development,'' Mr. Gdula said. ''We hope we can help the people there find new places to live and give them some certainty in their lives.''</p>
