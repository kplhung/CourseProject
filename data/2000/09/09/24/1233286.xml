        <p>It looked dicey this summer for a towering 205-year-old tulip tree at 11 Oceanview Place that a builder planned to remove to make way for two new homes. But then D. J.

        <p>It looked dicey this summer for a towering 205-year-old tulip tree at 11 Oceanview Place that a builder planned to remove to make way for two new homes. But then D. J. Donnelly, a 40-year-old caterer who lives on the block, started a campaign to save the tree, one of the largest on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>He called, faxed and e-mailed every city official he could think of, and persuaded a local newspaper and a couple of television news stations to cover the story. Several city officials said Mr. Donnelly's lobbying and efforts at publicity were relentless. Mr. Donnelly agreed. He said he felt a deep attachment to the tree, which spurred him on.</p>
        <p>''I have known this tree personally since 1965,'' he said, referring to the year that he and his mother, with whom he still lives, moved onto the block. ''I call it My Tulip Friend.''</p>
        <p>But the construction plans had already been approved by the city Department of Buildings, so his campaign appeared for naught. Then an official at the Department of City Planning found a zoning regulation that required the builder to redesign the homes and spare the tree. Mr. Donnelly's friend was saved.</p>
        <p>There was one more twist to come.</p>
        <p>Paul Wein, a spokesman for the Buildings Department, said an official at City Planning became curious about the tree. So the department hired Lee Gilman, an arborist, to examine it and make a report.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilman found that the tree was rife with hollow branches and other insults of old age. He added that its structural defects posed a severe risk and recommended that it come down to protect the safety of the people living near it. But Mr. Donnelly said he trusted his eyes over the report. ''The tree is still green and still standing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So what is next? Barring further reversals, the tree would seem doomed. Mr. Wein said the department had told the builder that if he resubmitted his original plans, which called for chopping down the tree, they would be approved. He said the builder had not yet gotten in touch with the department.</p>
        <p>Robert Corino, a developer who was listed as the owner of the property where the tree sits, did not return phone calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donnelly has vowed to battle on.</p>
        <p>''I shall not stop my fight until the last minute,'' he said. ''I am still trying to save my friend.''</p>
