        <p>Between the bodysuits and the 15 world records and the routine brilliance of two Dutch swimmers named Inge de Bruijn and Pieter van den Hoogenband, it was an unusual Olympic meet. But when it came down to the final two events of the final day, it ended as Olympic meets almost always end: with the Americans dominating the medley relays.</p>
        <p>The women went first, with B. J. Bedford, Megan Quann, Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres smashing China's six-year-old world mark by more than 3 seconds to finish in 3 minutes 58.30 seconds. The men went last, with Lenny Krayzelburg, Ed Moses, Ian Crocker and Gary Hall Jr. improving on the United States' four-year-old world mark by more than a second to finish in 3:33.73.</p>

        <p>Between the bodysuits and the 15 world records and the routine brilliance of two Dutch swimmers named Inge de Bruijn and Pieter van den Hoogenband, it was an unusual Olympic meet. But when it came down to the final two events of the final day, it ended as Olympic meets almost always end: with the Americans dominating the medley relays.</p>
        <p>The women went first, with B. J. Bedford, Megan Quann, Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres smashing China's six-year-old world mark by more than 3 seconds to finish in 3 minutes 58.30 seconds. The men went last, with Lenny Krayzelburg, Ed Moses, Ian Crocker and Gary Hall Jr. improving on the United States' four-year-old world mark by more than a second to finish in 3:33.73.</p>
        <p>It was an appropriate finish to a competition that was both a fan's and a statistician's delight. Though a greater number of countries are producing remarkable swimmers -- the Netherlands in particular -- the United States remains the lone superpower.</p>
        <p>Despite concerns about the team's inexperience, about the strength of Ian Thorpe and the Australian men, and about the small time gap between the United States Olympic trials and the Games, the Americans put together their most impressive collective performance in the pool since Montreal in 1976.</p>
        <p>Both the men and the women finished atop the medal and gold-medal counts, and the American team's 14 gold medals were its most since 1972 in a nonboycotted Olympics (The Americans won 21 in Los Angeles in 1984, the year the Soviet Union and most other Eastern European nations boycotted).</p>
        <p>The American team's 33 medals in Sydney were its most in a nonboycotted Games since 1976, when it won 34. ''When faced with a worthy opponent, it forces you to get your act together and step up,'' Hall said in reference to Australia. ''We were able to use that threat of being dethroned as the best swimming nation as motivation to reach a level that otherwise we might not have reached.''</p>
        <p>It was a remarkably balanced effort. The only Americans to win two individual gold medals were Krayzelburg, who swept both men's backstroke events, and Brooke Bennett, who won the women's 400 and 800 freestyles.</p>
        <p>The rest of the individual victories ranged from the predictable (Tom Dolan in the 400 individual medley; Tom Malchow in the 200 butterfly) to the mildly surprising (Quann in the 100 breaststroke; Hall and Anthony Ervin, who tied for gold in the 50 free) to the very surprising (Misty Hyman in the 200 butterfly).</p>
        <p>But the success did not come only at the top of the pyramid. According to Dennis Pursley, the United States national team director, more than 50 percent of the American swimmers improved on their personal bests in the Games.</p>
        <p>''In Seoul in 1998, that figure was down in the 20's and in Atlanta it was in the 40's,'' Pursley said. ''We really clicked here, and it was like a club team or college team where everybody gets in on the action. We had people from Lane 8 grabbing a medal. It wasn't just two or three superstars getting the job done.''</p>
        <p>Superstars were the explanation for the unprecedented success of the Netherlands, a country with only a handful of full-time elite swimming coaches and only about 20,000 registered competitive swimmers compared with the United States' 220,000 and Australia's 100,000. De Bruijn and van den Hoogenband were a two-headed medal detector, combining for five individual golds and five world records.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, de Bruijn, who had never won a medal in an Olympics or a world long-course championships until Sydney, won her third gold medal, holding off the silver medalist Therese Alshammer of Sweden and the 33-year-old Dara Torres of the United States to win the 50 free in 24.32 seconds, 19/100ths of a second slower than the world record she set in Friday's semifinals.</p>
        <p>A 27-year-old who declined to compete in the last Olympics because she was unmotivated and out of shape and afraid she might embarrass herself, De Bruijn has now broken or re-broken 11 world records in the last six months.</p>
        <p>''Before the Olympics I thought all my world records couldn't be broken, and I broke them all here,'' de Bruijn said. ''They're all going bananas back in the Netherlands. They are even letting children out of school to watch the Olympics. It's getting crazy.</p>
        <p>''Usually it's only soccer in the Netherlands. Now everyone is talking about swimming because of what we've done here. It's a great feeling.''</p>
        <p>The home team also had its moments, none more memorable than Thorpe's phenomenal freestyle anchor leg on opening night to give the Australians a victory over the Americans in the 4x100 freestyle relay. But while it finished with five gold medals and 18 overall medals, Australia did not entirely live up to its premeet potential. Thorpe was beaten by Van den Hoogenband in the 200. Susie O'Neill was upset by Hyman, and neither Michael Klim nor Geoff Huegill won the 100 fly; that honor went to Lars Froelander of Sweden.</p>
        <p>But there was still enough gold and more than enough emotion to give the eight consecutive sellout crowds their Australian dollar's worth, and in the men's 1,500 freestyle today, the Australians Grant Hackett and Kieren Perkins were accompanied by a constant roar.</p>
        <p>The enormously popular Perkins was trying to become the first man to win the same event in three consecutive Olympics, but though he managed to break 15 minutes in the semifinal and improve on that slightly in the final, it was only good enough for silver. Hackett, who like Perkins hails from the northern state of Queensland, would win the gold in 14:48.33. Perkins finished in 14:53.59: well short of his six-year-old world record of 14:41.66.</p>
        <p>The American Chris Thompson finished third in a national-record time of 14:56.81.</p>
        <p>''I hope Grant appreciates it as much as the rest of the team does,'' Perkins said of the opportunity to swim in Sydney. ''Because no matter what any of us do in the rest of our careers, or what we've done before the last eight days, will never come close to it. Just because of this place and this atmosphere. It's quite exceptional.''</p>
        <p>The question that continues to nag swimming is whether all the exceptional times and performances are legitimate. Though blood testing was introduced in Sydney in an attempt to detect the banned synthetic hormone known as EPO, Pursley said he was disappointed that only 4 of the 48 American swimmers here were required to submit to blood tests.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to see us get to a point where every swimmer is blood tested,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Pursley also indicated that the percentage of American swimmers who were administered urine tests during the competition was the same as in 1996.</p>
        <p>''We were expecting to see a lot more,'' he said. ''It does bother us. We would like to see a lot more aggressive effort. Our big fear is there is going to be some complacency because we don't see the big mass use by a whole team of swimmers as we did with the Chinese and East Germany.</p>
        <p>''If people sit back and think we've got it beat, we're going to be right back to where we were, if not worse, and we may be already no better off,'' Pursley said. ''It may just be spread out. I don't know. There are a lot of suspicions, and I have no idea to what degree they are accurate. I think we'd be a little naive to think it's cleaned up.''</p>
