        <p>Once-abundant sturgeon population in Caspian Sea, which has supplied much of world with caviar for past century, has plummeted because of poaching and pollution and faces extinction; Russia's State Fishing Committee reports official spring sturgeon catch of 400 tons was lowest in century and represents 60 percent drop from 1999; scientists estimate adult sturgeon population, which numbered 1.5 million in 1986, has fallen below 300,000 and is being harvested at rate that can be sustained for only few more years, even though Russia and Iran have stocked sea with up to 100 million baby sturgeon each year since 1960's; in addition to depredations of poachers, up to third of female sturgeon is suffering from severe chemical poisoning that has rendered them infertile; many people in Astrakhan, Russia, have turned to poaching in order to survive; map; photo (M)</p>

        <p>On a dusty finger of land in the sprawling delta where the Volga River drains into the Caspian Sea, Vera Visokogorskaya is a Mary Poppins figure in a white smock, hovering and fussing over 75,000 baby sturgeon she is raising in a rundown state hatchery.</p>
        <p>On another finger of the Volga delta, a fisherman named Aleksei is knocking back shots of vodka at the table of his friend, Boris, describing their lives as poachers. Like tens of thousands of other fishermen in the hinterland of the delta, they slaughtered a mountain of sturgeon this spring under the cover of darkness to eat the meat and sell caviar ripped from the females to black marketeers.</p>
        <p>These two residents of Russia's caviar-producing region represent the intensifying clash of interests among Russians and their newly independent neighbors: along the shores of the Caspian, the world's largest inland sea, competition for resources threatens extinction of the last great sturgeon population on earth. Just two centuries ago, sturgeon were abundant throughout the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
        <p>Aleksei -- who would only give his first name -- admits that he is part of a problem that no one in Russia is doing much to solve. ''I am not Greenpeace,'' he said with mock bravado. ''My anxiety will not change the fate of this fish.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Visokogorskaya is proud to be a nurturer, part of the solution. But the destroyers are legion, and the damage they are inflicting may soon be irreversible.</p>
        <p>After a century of supplying the world with caviar, which fetches as much as $2,000 a pound in Geneva, Paris and New York, the Caspian sturgeon population, 70 percent of the world's reserves, is being harvested at a rate that can be sustained for only a few more years, experts and law enforcement officials say.</p>
        <p>Though Russia and Iran have been stocking the Caspian Sea with up to 100 million baby sturgeon a year since the 1960's, the fish population is plummeting. This spring's official sturgeon catch of 400 tons was the lowest in a century and represented a 60 percent drop from 1999, the State Fishing Committee said. Scientists estimate that the adult sturgeon population, which numbered 1.5 million in 1986, has fallen below 300,000. And the health of many fish is in decline.</p>
        <p>Caviar production is expected to drop to 40 tons this year, down from 1,200 tons in 1985.</p>
        <p>''No one wants to have caviar banned,'' said Uldry Thierry, the chief executive of the Geneva-based Caviar House, one of Europe's largest retailers, which processes 25 tons a year in a market estimated at 80 to 100 tons. (Americans consume 40 to 50 tons a year.) ''But the Russian government has got to find an answer, and the only answer is stricter controls against poaching.''</p>
        <p>The illegal sturgeon catch is estimated at 5 to 10 times the official catch. Strict export licensing and DNA testing of caviar samples has led to some spectacular hauls of illegal shipments to the United States in the last year, but the black market has grown phenomenally over the last two decades.</p>
        <p>Besides the depredations of poachers, up to a third of the female sturgeon are suffering from chemical poisoning severe enough to render them infertile, scientists report. And the proportion of female sturgeon reaching spawning grounds has also fallen, to just 20 or 30 percent.</p>
        <p>''The situation is very serious,'' said John Sellar, the chief of enforcement for the secretariat of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, in Geneva. With caviar bars and restaurants multiplying in the West, Mr. Sellar suggested that ''people are behaving in a very irresponsible manner.''</p>
        <p>In December, scientists from the convention that regulates trade in endangered species will meet in West Virginia to decide whether to declare the Caspian sturgeon so endangered as to warrant a total ban on trade until the species recovers.</p>
        <p>To stop fishing would be an economic and political catastrophe feared by all the Caspian governments -- Russia, Iran, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan -- but it may be inevitable if the species is to survive.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union rigorously policed the fishing grounds of the Caspian, but also sowed the seeds for the current decline. Sixty years of dam building eliminated 70 to 80 percent of the sturgeons' spawning grounds along the Volga, where since prehistoric times belugas, the largest sturgeon, whose plump gray caviar is most prized, ranged 1,000 miles inland to spawn.</p>
        <p>As Soviet planners diverted water supplies to artificial reservoirs, the level of the Caspian declined nearly 10 feet. The spread of agriculture and industrialization dealt another blow, as pesticide runoff killed thousands of fish.</p>
        <p>The discovery of huge oil and gas reserves off Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan represents an added potential danger.</p>
        <p>Given the general poverty, poaching sturgeon is simply a means to survive for countless thousands of families here, who send their men out in small boats at night to kill fish for the table and, with luck, sell a little caviar on the black market.</p>
        <p>Seated at Boris's table in a rundown apartment on the outskirts of Astrakhan, Aleksei described their business.</p>
        <p>Many of the 50,000 people in the area once worked at a paper mill, he said. ''When it closed, these people had no other way to earn money or to eat, and so the river feeds them.''</p>
        <p>In wooden boats, the poachers lay submerged lines dangling hundreds of hooks to snag the migrating sturgeon.</p>
        <p>''The night is what hides us,'' Aleksei said. ''If you hear the sound of a motor boat, you hide among the bushes on the shore.'' The motorboats are usually the police, who regularly drag an anchor behind them to pull up as many poacher lines as they can. But the lines are quickly laid again.</p>
        <p>''We keep our catch in the water on a rope and the rope is in my hand,'' Aleksei said. ''If the police come to my side of the boat to inspect us, I just let it go. Few poachers are ever caught, and, when they are, they face a light fine and confiscation of their fish.</p>
        <p>The damage from small-scale poachers is compounded by the organized poaching that occurs out at sea by criminal gangs with fast boats, satellite navigation systems and the protection of corrupt police or military officials.</p>
        <p>But at Bios, a state hatchery and research center 25 miles southwest of Astrakhan, the director, Lidia M. Vassileva, is in charge of one of 13 fish farms that try to sustain the sturgeon population by releasing 60 million palm-sized fish into the Volga and the Caspian every year.</p>
        <p>''Sturgeon are like a living relic, and the reason they are on the brink of extinction is that you have two natural resources that cannot coexist -- oil and fish,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The state company for which she works has developed a modest business in selling fertilized caviar -- which is, after all, just eggs -- to fish farms in Russia, China, Europe and the United States, where the fish are raised for meat and sold to restaurants and food-processing industries.</p>
        <p>More ambitiously, Bios is trying to raise sturgeon until they are sexually mature, a process that takes 10 to 20 years, and then harvest caviar without killing the females. The technique has been demonstrated at a handful of fish farms, but requires long investment before there is any return.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vassileva's assistant, Ms. Visokogorskaya, each year supervises the fertilization of 20 million sturgeon minnows for release into the Volga, and helps raise 75,000 sturgeon.</p>
        <p>Moving among their tanks like a matriarch, she snatched a six-pounder out of one tank. She looked with pride over what she calls her flock and said, ''In Russia, we have an economic crisis, but in the world, they only want caviar.''</p>
