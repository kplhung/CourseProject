        <p>''THIS is the time of year when things start to get hysterical,'' said Carol Gill as she reached for the phone. It was early on a September morning, and Ms. Gill, seated at the desk in her spacious Dobbs Ferry office and clad in a dark business suit, could have been mistaken for a high-powered lawyer or consultant besieged with clients.</p>
        <p>But in Ms. Gill's business, the clients are anxious 17-year-olds and their parents. Most are from Westchester, some from as far away as Greece. All are willing to pay several thousand dollars in the hope that Ms. Gill can help them gain admission to a top-notch college.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gill, who runs the largest private college counseling practice in Westchester, says she cannot guarantee that. She merely helps the family find a college that is a good match and coaches students and parents through the process -- doing practice interviews, revising the essay and helping students decide which classes or exams to take and how to prepare for them.</p>
        <p>But that does not stop a growing number of people from seeking out private counselors, particularly in wealthy suburbs. ''It's Westchester's biggest cottage industry,'' said Penny Oberg, the director of college counseling at Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua.</p>
        <p>There are no statistics on the number of counselors in the county -- particularly since many work part time -- but Mark Sklarow, the director of the Virginia-based Independent Educational Counselors Association, said Westchester is one of the hottest markets in the country in a field that has grown exponentially in recent years.</p>
        <p>The rise of private counseling mirrors the increased competitiveness of the college process. Last year the nation's most selective colleges received record numbers of applications, and that record is likely to be broken this year as the number of students graduating from high school grows, along with the value placed on a luxury-brand education.</p>
        <p>Private counseling has also added to the disparity between what is available to wealthy and poor parents in that process. Financing for high school-based college counseling has declined considerably in the last decade, and in many large urban school districts the ratio of students to counselors is several hundred to one, said Pat McDonough, an associate professor at U.C.L.A who has studied the private counseling business.</p>
        <p>But Ms. McDonough added that most private counselors work in wealthy suburbs like Westchester, where college counseling programs tend to be excellent and parents are eager for any sort of advantage in the admissions game. One longtime counselor estimated that 15 to 20 percent of the juniors and seniors in public high schools in wealthier communities in the county are seeing private counselors.</p>
        <p>And private counseling can be expensive. Counselors charge anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $29,000 to work with a student. (Ms. Gill's fee is $3,500 for unlimited consultation time.)</p>
        <p>Yet it is not always clear what that money buys. To some, private counselors are parasites feeding off the intense anxiety parents bring to the college application process. To others, they are a valuable aid, relieving parents' worries and often providing the boost that may make the crucial difference on an application.</p>
        <p>Asked for an example of what she does, Ms. Gill flips open a thick folder for one of her clients, a former student at Clarkstown South High School in West Nyack. Pointing to a heavily marked-up draft of the student's college essay, she explains that it was about the Special Olympics, which he had found repellent. ''It was a bad, negative essay that could have hurt his chances,'' she said. She urged him to rewrite it. He did, and he is now a freshman at Yale.</p>
        <p>Opening a second folder, she displays several letters she wrote on behalf of another student who had academic difficulties at the Hackley School in Tarrytown and transferred to the Kent School in Connecticut at her suggestion. He had further trouble there and transferred to the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry for his senior year. His grades improved there, but the application process was a struggle.</p>
        <p>''I wrote letters and made calls. It got down to the wait list, and we worked through May for him,'' Ms. Gill said. Finally, he was admitted to Trinity College in Hartford.  ''Truthfully, it would not have happened without an intervention by me or someone like me,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Most of what Ms. Gill does has traditionally been the province of high school counselors. Partly for that reason, private counseling in Westchester is an oddly secretive business, many counselors and parents say.</p>
        <p>The counselors generally urge students not to tell their high school counselor that they are seeing someone else because of the potential for professional rivalry. ''I tell my kids, 'Do not, on pain of torture, tell your high school counselor you're seeing me,' '' said Michele Hernandez, a Florida-based counselor who has had Westchester clients.</p>
        <p>They also tend to keep it a secret from colleges because it might put admissions officers on notice that a student had been coached and cast a shadow on the application.</p>
        <p>And parents often refuse to talk about having hired a private consultant. ''Some parents deny they worked with anyone,'' said Glenna Bonderoff, a private counselor based in Scarsdale. ''And some parents do not want their names used. They're people I can't use for a reference until their kids are out of the school system.''</p>
        <p>For many of these parents, anything that might influence a child's success or failure in the college process becomes a jealously guarded secret.</p>
        <p>''People who have connections or an edge don't want others to take advantage of it,'' said Donna Shaitken, a parent in Chappaqua. ''And they don't want anyone to know they needed help. At least in this community, I find people are really secretive about that stuff.''</p>
        <p>Westchester's suburban environment heightens these tensions because it has all the pressures of the city without its sheltering anonymity, said Jill Schehr, a school psychologist in Chappaqua whose children are now in college. ''All of a sudden a community that is very supportive and conversational becomes very isolated'' when it comes to college admissions, she said.</p>
        <p>Yet despite the secrecy and a great deal of hype about ''connections'' that can get children into the Ivy League -- some of it generated by the counselors themselves -- all the counselors interviewed conceded that they have no special influence with admissions officers. And several admissions deans said that no recommendation from a paid counselor could have any weight in the admissions process.</p>
        <p>Instead, the counselors say, their role is that of a matchmaker, finding an appropriate school for students and helping them to put their best foot forward.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gill, for instance, starts off by meeting with the student and parents, preferably early in the sophomore year. After examining the student's record, she discusses a list of potential colleges and explains which kinds of grades, test scores and extracurricular activities would help. She may also arrange tutoring for the SAT1 and the SAT2 subject tests.</p>
        <p>As senior year approaches, she meets with the student more often, monitoring his or her progress, helping with the college visits and interview and brainstorming and revising when it comes time to fill out the application. Unlike most counselors, Ms. Gill does contact the college in most cases, though generally not at the top schools, where it is frowned upon.</p>
        <p>The counselors' most important stock in trade is their claim to know what admissions officers are looking for. Often, that claim is backed by experience in college admissions or high school college counseling. Ms. Gill, for instance, was the director of admissions at Barnard for four years before going into private practice in 1985.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gill, who employs four full-time staff members and a number of other people part time, said her yearly income is roughly equivalent to that of a school administrator with 25 years' experience. Nationally, private counselors earn about $75,000 a year, and in Westchester the figure is likely to be higher, Mr. Sklarow said.</p>
        <p>Sometimes counselors will use their knowledge of the admissions process to suggest substantial changes in a student's career. Jessica Boyko was a junior at North Salem High School when she first started seeing Pearl Glassman, a private counselor based in Pound Ridge. She wanted to do a pre-med curriculum in college, but she scored 1,050 on the SAT -- not high enough for her target schools. Ms. Glassman suggested SAT tutors, and Ms. Boyko eventually did raise her score by 110 points.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Glassman also suggested that she develop her interest in art, because the schools would put less emphasis on her SAT scores that way. At Ms. Glassman's urging, Ms. Boyko put together a portfolio and eventually got into Boston University, one of her top choices. ''She got in on art, and now if she wants to switch back to pre-med she can,'' said her father, Rick Boyko.</p>
        <p>Adam Goodman, who worked with Pearl Glassman while he was at John Jay High School in Cross River and is now a freshman at Dartmouth, said she helped him present his achievements to colleges without seeming to boast, something he would have felt uncomfortable about doing on his own.</p>
        <p>''It's a delicate balancing act -- putting it in their faces but not doing it obnoxiously. They want to know what you've done, but they don't want to think you're bragging or arrogant,'' he said. Mr. Goodman added that some of his friends would have benefited from Ms. Glassman's advice. ''Sometimes the most qualified people don't get in because they don't know how to sell themselves,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In many cases, however, the counselors seem to be little more than a kind of security blanket, providing helpful facts and information to students who would probably have done well on their own. Mr. Goodman, for instance, had a straight-A average, sang in the school chorus and got 1,520 on the SAT's, with a perfect 800 score on the verbal section. Ms. Glassman's advice may have been helpful, but no one was surprised when he got into Dartmouth.</p>
        <p>Several counselors conceded that relieving parents and students' anxieties was among their most important roles. And a number of parents agreed, saying that the emotional cushion the counselors provided was well worth the fee. ''Working with Ms. Glassman helped to alleviate some of the anxiety we felt as parents,'' Kathy Goodman, Adam's mother, said. ''There's an awful lot of misinformation, and I think that contributes to the stress.''</p>
        <p>It also seems clear that private counselors can be a useful proxy, offering the kind of guidance adolescents are often reluctant to accept from their parents. The counselor will do the nagging about deadlines and will encourage the student to challenge herself and aim for the best college possible.</p>
        <p>''Somehow coming from us the advice doesn't carry the same weight as it does coming from someone who isn't their parents and has a little distance from them,'' Mr. Boyko, Jessica's father, said.</p>
        <p>Yet several parents also said their experience with private counselors was useless. ''I certainly don't think these people have any edge to getting kids in anywhere,'' said Donna Shaitken, whose son worked briefly with a private counselor while he was a student at Horace Greeley. He found it not to be useful and is now a freshman at Columbia. ''I think it's a waste, and I think parents can do it themselves.'' Other parents expressed resentment at counselors who implied that their connections would help a student get in and failed to deliver.</p>
        <p>There is little doubt that some counselors make outrageous claims. That is one of the dangers posed by the field's rapid growth, Mr. Sklarow said. The association of private counselors he directs has 300 members, and last year there were 1,100 new applicants.</p>
        <p>''The vast majority are folks that have just gotten into the field in the last year or two,'' he said. ''They've just hung out a shingle, and sometimes that just means clearing off a kitchen table. Some have no background in education or counseling.''</p>
        <p>The Independent Educational Counselors Association has professional and ethical standards for its members, including three years' experience. The National Association for College Admission Counseling, which includes college admissions staff, high school counselors and private counselors, has similar standards.</p>
        <p>But many of the new private counselors are not members of either group. ''Any counselor who says I can get you into Harvard -- walk away quickly,'' Joyce Smith, the director of the National Association, said. ''A lot of them will use that kind of advertising tactic.''</p>
        <p>Other counselors will write students' essays for them, she said.</p>
        <p>Anthony F. Capraro, a private counselor based in Purchase, said, ''As I go to meetings and listen to independent counselors talk, I am just flabbergasted by what they will do for the kids.''</p>
        <p>The field has also been altered by the introduction of a number of corporate-style counseling services, like the California-based company Achieva, which contracts with schools to do their college advising, and the inception of counseling services by the two largest SAT preparation companies, Stanley Kaplan and the Princeton Review.</p>
        <p>There are also several Internet-based college counseling services. Some of these use e-mail, but there is at least one Web site that says it is offering college counseling: www.pureadvice.com. It charges $75 for a 45-minute live session.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these changes have made it far more difficult for college admissions officers to judge how an application really reflects the applicant.</p>
        <p>This year Duke University broke new ground by including a note at the bottom of the essay page on its application, as follows: ''We recognize that all good writers seek feedback, advice or editing before sending off an essay. When your essay is complete, please answer the following: Whose advice did you seek for help with your essay? Was he/she helpful? What help did he/she provide?''</p>
        <p>Christoph Guttentag, the director of admissions at Duke, said, ''One of the things we know is that students get different levels of help with their essay,'' including help from paid counselors. ''We think it's valuable for us in terms of what the essay is telling us about the student to know the context in which the essay was created.''</p>
        <p>The growth of the private counseling industry has also aggravated long-simmering concerns about the inequities of the college application process.</p>
        <p>''One of the things we and many admissions offices have come to recognize is that there are many families who have no counselors at all,'' said William Fitzsimmons, the dean of undergraduate admissions at Harvard. ''Something akin to a national disaster is going on in many parts of the country. I think counselors are trying their best, but they don't have the resources to deal with the number of students they have.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, wealthy families -- whose children tend to be in schools where counseling programs are already good -- are the ones who can afford extra help, Ms. McDonough said. ''These students are mostly white, upper middle class, with parents who are college educated and usually have a graduate degree.'' Most private counselors do some pro bono work for lower-income students, but such work usually amounts to a small fraction of their client base.</p>
        <p>''You've got the advantaged getting more advantages, and the disadvantaged getting further behind,'' Ms. McDonough said.</p>
        <p>The equity issue is particularly stark in Westchester. For example, in Scarsdale, the ratio of high school students to counselors is 170 to 1, compared with 300 to 1 in Yonkers.  Last year that inequity inspired Eugenie Lang, a Scarsdale native, to start Get Ready, a program to provide free college counseling to students in Mount Vernon.</p>
        <p>It began in 1998 as an SAT tutoring program, with a dozen former Scarsdale High students, most of them at Ivy League schools, volunteering their assistance. Ms. Lang came up with the program while tutoring the child of a wealthy family in the summer after her sophomore year at Harvard.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lang, who is not related to Eugene Lang, founder of the I Have a Dream Foundation, added college counseling to the program last year. She invited admissions counselors from Sarah Lawrence and other colleges to speak to her students, and she instituted a formal mentor program in which instructors meet with their students three times a week, once at a library. The students also get a tour of Columbia University and a strategy session on how to do college visits and interviews.</p>
        <p>''The goal of our organization is to build the same networks of support around lower-income students that consistently get middle-  and upper-income kids into college,'' Ms. Lang said.</p>
        <p>That will not be easy. Get Ready, which is financed through grants that Ms. Lang has received and donations from the for-profit test company Test Takers, has worked with 150 students in the Mount Vernon area and another 80 at a center in Boston.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, for better or worse, the private counseling business continues to grow. Nationally, the number of college freshmen who said they had seen a private counselor jumped to 10 percent today from 1 percent in 1990, with most of the growth occurring in the last three years, according to surveys conducted by the Independent Educational Counselors Association.</p>
