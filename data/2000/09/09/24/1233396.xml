        <p>Forty states will soon lose hundreds of millions of dollars of federal money that was supposed to provide health insurance to children in low-income families, federal and state officials say.</p>
        <p>The money -- 45 percent of the $4.2 billion provided by Congress -- remains unspent by the states after three years. It will be given to New York and nine other states that used their full allotments of federal money under the Children's Health Insurance Program, which was created by Congress, with much enthusiasm and fanfare, in 1997.</p>
        <p>''We would like to be able to keep that money and use it to provide health care to children,'' said Helene Robinson, director of the state program in Louisiana, which expects to lose $63.7 million, or 63 percent of its federal allotment of $101.7 million.</p>
        <p>California and Texas account for more than half of the unspent money -- $590 million and $446.3 million, respectively. Together, they have 29 percent of the nation's 11 million uninsured children.</p>
        <p>Health care for children has become a major issue in the presidential campaign. Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, says Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, has a dismal record of providing health insurance to children in Texas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush rejects the criticism. Texas officials say 100,000 children have enrolled in the new program since they began taking applications in April.</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said Mr. Gore ''should address the problems on his own watch.'' Mr. Bartlett said that the number of uninsured children nationwide had increased since the Clinton administration took office, and Census Bureau reports show  that the 11 million figure is up from 9.6 million in 1993.</p>
        <p>States have until Sept. 30 to spend the money they were allotted. In interviews with The New York Times, officials in 20 states gave these reasons for failing to use their full allotments:</p>
        <p>*Some states took a year or more to start enrolling children.</p>
        <p>*Some were reluctant to put up the state money they had to spend to obtain the full amount of federal money available.</p>
        <p>*Some states said they could not find enough eligible uninsured children to use all their federal money.</p>
        <p>*Some states inadvertently deterred enrollment by using complex application forms and procedures.</p>
        <p>*Some states complained that the federal government had administered the program in a rigid, inflexible way that prevented them from spending the money for children who might have benefited.</p>
        <p>In addition to New York, the states that have used all of their 1998 allotments are Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. Those states will have just one year to spend the extra money, which reverts to the Treasury after Sept. 30, 2001.</p>
        <p>The Children's Defense Fund, an advocacy group, celebrated creation of the program as a landmark in social policy. But Gregg Haifley, deputy director of the fund's health division, said the group was now telling states: ''Get off the dime. Spend this money on what it's intended for. Don't let it just pile up or trickle through your hands.''</p>
        <p>The Children's Health Insurance  Program is meant to help children in families with too much income to qualify for Medicaid and too little to afford private insurance. State officials said the program had done immense good, by providing care to more than two million children while also stimulating improvements in Medicaid.</p>
        <p>But spending has lagged behind expectations. Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, said, ''A significant portion of the allotments will be unspent.''</p>
        <p>Colorado illustrates the experience of many states. It has spent $22.7 million of its 1998 allotment of $41.8 million and expects to lose the remaining $19.1 million, or 46 percent of its allocation.</p>
        <p>William N. Lindsay, president of the Child Health Policy Board in Colorado, which supervises the program, said: ''If we enrolled every single eligible child in Colorado, we still couldn't spend our full allocation of federal money. Our economy is doing so well, there are fewer eligible kids than what was estimated when the federal government did its initial allocation of money.''</p>
        <p>Congress provided a total of $40 billion over 10 years. States had three years -- from Oct. 1, 1997, to Sept. 30, 2000 -- to use the first year's installment of $4.2 billion. State and federal officials said that $1.9 billion of that amount would be unspent at the end of this month.</p>
        <p>Frank C. Ullman, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute here, said, ''It is likely that even fewer states will exhaust their 1999 allotments,'' which remain available through September 2001.</p>
        <p>New York has the biggest child health program in the country. It has used all of its federal money for 1998 and 1999 and much of its allotment for 2000. Enrollment in New York has reached 550,000, about one-fourth of the national total, and is growing by more than 15,000 a month.</p>
        <p>Connecticut has spent $25.5 million of its $35 million allocation and expects to lose $9.5 million, or 27 percent of its money.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, Edward J. Rogan, a spokesman for the Department of Human Services, said the state had spent $78.4 million of the $88.4 million available from the federal government. ''Unfortunately,'' Mr. Rogan said, ''that leaves a balance of $10 million. We would like to have spent the entire allotment.''</p>
        <p>The federal government pays from 65 percent to 84 percent of the costs of state programs to insure low-income children.</p>
        <p>In Louisiana, State Senator Donald E. Hines, a Democrat who is also a family physician, said: ''We were not able to take advantage of some of the federal money because we had difficulty coming up with the state matching money. We had a shortfall in our budget in the last two years. This year we made cuts in the health and hospitals budget. I don't think we needed the entire amount of federal money anyhow.''</p>
        <p>New Mexico said it would use just $5.1 million of its $62.9 million allotment, leaving $57.8 million, or 92 percent, unspent.</p>
        <p>J. Barry Bitzer, deputy secretary of the Human Services Department in New Mexico, said: ''The federal law and regulations provided New Mexico with a lot more money than we could possibly use. We have 30,000 uninsured kids, of whom no more than 1,000 are eligible for the new program.''</p>
        <p>Florida has spent $201 million of its 1998 allotment of $270 million, leaving $69 million, or 26 percent, unused.</p>
        <p>Justin J. Sayfie, a spokesman for Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, said: ''There was a lag in getting the program up and running. The Florida Legislature didn't meet until March 1998, and Florida started implementing the program in October 1998. We were one year behind the curve.''</p>
        <p>Illinois has used $55 million of its allotment of $122.5 million, leaving $67.5 million, or 55 percent, unspent.</p>
        <p>Eric P. Robinson, a spokesman for the Illinois Department of Public Aid, said: ''We are aggressively reaching out to enroll children, but it's unrealistic to think we could have used $122 million in three years. We can't just flip a switch and achieve full enrollment.''</p>
        <p>California, which was allotted $854 million, expects to lose $590 million, or 69 percent of its federal money.</p>
        <p>Diana M. Bonta, director of the California Department of Health Services, said the program got off to a slow start under Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican. But, she said, since Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, took office in January 1999, enrollment has increased at a brisk pace, to 330,000 from 56,000.</p>
        <p>Ken August, a spokesman for the California agency, said: ''The application form was long and confusing. It's been greatly simplified. It was 28 pages. It's now 4 pages. And it's available in 11 languages.''</p>
        <p>New Hampshire has used $4 million of its 1998 allocation of $11.5 million, leaving $7.5 million, or 65 percent, for redistribution to other states. Kathleen A. Dunn, a state official who supervises the child health program in New Hampshire, said the federal government ''allocated more money to us than we needed to bring this program online.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, Indiana found more uninsured children than expected, and it has spent all of its allotment of $70.5 million to cover them.</p>
        <p>States may not use the new federal money to cover children eligible for Medicaid. This has created problems for states like Minnesota and Washington, which expanded Medicaid eligibility before 1997 and were already covering most low-income children.</p>
        <p>Minnesota says it has spent less than $500,000 of its $28.4 million allotment. Washington State has spent $2.2 million of its $46.7 million allocation.</p>
        <p>''We did something progressive, but we did it too early,'' said Mary B. Kennedy, the Medicaid director in Minnesota.</p>
        <p>West Virginia, one of the poorest states in the nation, has used $12 million of its $23.6 million, leaving $11.6 million unspent. The state says that its new program covers 11,600 children, but that 14,000 youngsters still have no health insurance.</p>
        <p>''It's regrettable that, for whatever reason, we didn't have our plan approved until September of 1998,'' said Dorothy V. Yeager, acting director of the West Virginia program. ''We lost one of the three years we had to spend the money.''</p>
