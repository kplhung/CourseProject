        <p>WHEN Christina Ha started dating Marcus Solis in the fall of 1996, she was so weary of living in New York that nothing could cheer her up about the city -- not even getting invited to a glamorous movie premiere or taking a cab up Madison Avenue and having every traffic light turn green for her.</p>
        <p>''I was tired of the subways, the small apartments, the weak dating scene,'' she said. ''I wanted to go to Montana. I said: 'I'll be a cowgirl. I'll have open air. I'll ride a horse.' '' She added: ''But I fell in love with Marcus and I didn't hate the city anymore. Suddenly, if I was stuck in traffic, it didn't matter.''</p>

        <p>WHEN Christina Ha started dating Marcus Solis in the fall of 1996, she was so weary of living in New York that nothing could cheer her up about the city -- not even getting invited to a glamorous movie premiere or taking a cab up Madison Avenue and having every traffic light turn green for her.</p>
        <p>''I was tired of the subways, the small apartments, the weak dating scene,'' she said. ''I wanted to go to Montana. I said: 'I'll be a cowgirl. I'll have open air. I'll ride a horse.' '' She added: ''But I fell in love with Marcus and I didn't hate the city anymore. Suddenly, if I was stuck in traffic, it didn't matter.''</p>
        <p>Friends say Ms. Ha, 34, is a spontaneous, strong woman who can camp out in the wilderness but who also knows exactly how to hold her teacup during high tea at the Carlyle. She was born in Flushing, Queens, into a household where tradition, history and good posture were emphasized.</p>
        <p>''I raised my children to feel they were very special,'' said her mother, Yanghe Peggy Yun Wong, now of Columbia, Md., whose own father, the late Tchi Chang Yun, was South Korea's first envoy to England. ''When I taught them table manners, I said: 'You may be dining with the Queen of England one day. You never know where life will take you.' ''</p>
        <p>Life eventually led Ms. Ha to New York 1 News, the cable television station, where she met Mr. Solis when they were fellow reporters. Now 31 and a reporter on WABC-TV in Manhattan, Mr. Solis is a quiet and serious person who grew up in the Bronx loving the Mets, Pink Floyd and any occasion when he could pretend to be an announcer (as a child, he used Lincoln Logs as microphones).</p>
        <p>''I liked the fact that he was an outer-borough boy and I was also an outer-borough person,'' said Ms. Ha, a Yankees fan, who is now a features reporter on Metro, another Manhattan cable channel. ''He's Puerto Rican, so he introduced me to a couple of good Latina-Hispanic restaurants in the Bronx, and on the flip side, I introduced him to Korean food in Flushing.''</p>
        <p>They had an outer-borough courtship, she said, playing tennis in Pelham Bay Park or meeting for beers on City Island, both in the Bronx. In 1997, Mr. Solis gave her a Montana calendar with a note that read: ''Now, you don't have to leave. You can be in Montana every day of the year.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, they moved into an Upper West Side apartment together, where they became serious homebodies with a large spice rack and a tattered Scrabble board. Ms. Ha, who at one time went out almost every night, now often cooks gourmet dinners at home. Mr. Solis specializes in breakfast. ''Marcus makes pancakes, perfect pancakes, perfectly round, perfectly fluffy,'' she said. ''But you know what? That's all he makes.''</p>
        <p>He proposed last September in the Napa Valley. ''She's got the greatest heart,'' he said. ''She's kind and loving and we make each other laugh. I can be stubborn and hold grudges, and Christina was the first person I couldn't hold a grudge against.''</p>
        <p>Their wedding on Sept. 16 blended their religious backgrounds (he is Catholic; she is Methodist), childhoods and sports team affiliations. They were married in a Roman Catholic ceremony at the Sacred Heart Church in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., with a reception afterward at Estherwood, an ornate mansion in Dobbs Ferry that makes one think of bustled gowns and dinner parties from ''The Age of Innocence,'' the bride's favorite movie.</p>
        <p>During the cocktail hour, a band, the Puerto Rico Quatro Project, played Puerto Rican folk songs, and after that, the couple changed into Korean wedding clothes and performed a traditional bowing ceremony, in which they asked for their parents' blessings. The toast from the best man, Mark Nasser, was all about New York baseball.</p>
        <p>''Marcus grew up a Mets fan, I grew up a Yankees fan,'' he said. ''Let me tell you, Christina is on my side. And the thought of Marcus having to spend the rest of his life with a Yankees fan, that makes me very happy.''</p>
