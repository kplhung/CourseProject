        <p>My first writing jobs were for the David Frost and Dick Cavett talk shows -- which were extremely exciting because whatever I wrote was usually seen the very night I wrote it on national television. This instant gratification spoiled me. When I was, ahem, excused from the Cavett show and began to write plays and movies, there was either no feedback at all or it would dribble in months after the work was completed.</p>
        <p>I don't have now, and didn't have then, the inner reserves of self-confidence to shore up a fathomless need for reinforcement, so I took up cooking. It was creative, sensual, filled my tiny apartment with wonderful smells and became a much-admired way to avoid writing. And the reinforcement was as instantaneous as a daily talk show, unless I was preparing thousand-year-old eggs.</p>

        <p>My first writing jobs were for the David Frost and Dick Cavett talk shows -- which were extremely exciting because whatever I wrote was usually seen the very night I wrote it on national television. This instant gratification spoiled me. When I was, ahem, excused from the Cavett show and began to write plays and movies, there was either no feedback at all or it would dribble in months after the work was completed.</p>
        <p>I don't have now, and didn't have then, the inner reserves of self-confidence to shore up a fathomless need for reinforcement, so I took up cooking. It was creative, sensual, filled my tiny apartment with wonderful smells and became a much-admired way to avoid writing. And the reinforcement was as instantaneous as a daily talk show, unless I was preparing thousand-year-old eggs.</p>
        <p>Serendipitously, I found that a man cooking turned out to be seductive. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it's the surprise, or the role reversal, or some revelation of this fuzzy soft center we're all supposed to have, or the implied altruism -- he's taking the time to whip up that bavarois just for me -- but every woman I've asked claims that a man cooking specifically for her is an aphrodisiac.</p>
        <p>The reverse is not true. Men often find women who cook for them scary, grasping, desperate and clearly in search of a lifelong mate. Worst of all, it's expected, like men plumbing. (Back off, Gloria; this is personal anecdote, not sociology.)</p>
        <p>My evidence is empirical. Two instances spring to mind. I wish I could brag about them over beers, but due to substantial defects in my personality, both failed to evolve into anything lasting longer than a few hours. The first woman, although sufficiently smitten by what I prepared, wouldn't go out with me for another five months, and that date was the last. Something terrible must have happened between the pear frangipane tart and breakfast, and I never knew what it was, though I am still willing to learn.</p>
        <p>The second, who had inexplicably changed her name from Jane to Kathrin because she thought the former boring, had actually made another date the same night, to take place after I'd made her dinner. Smitten as she, too, seemed by the act of cooking just for her, she nevertheless left at 10 p.m., and I didn't see her again for more than 10 years, when she wouldn't even hold hands. And that second guy never even thanked me.</p>
        <p>Neither of these instances was calculated. I loved cooking and selflessly (well, sort of) wanted to cook for them. And since I wasn't making a dime at the time, it was actually quite a bit cheaper to do so. Besides, taking a woman to a restaurant is as stressful as the night the critic comes to your play and about as original as carrying her books. A man has to be truly obnoxious to impress a woman at a restaurant on a first date. But wielding a cleaver in his own kitchen, well, the work speaks for itself.</p>
        <p>Also, there is a moment during a date when, you hope, her eyes will forget the background and focus on you, or she will laugh at an idiosyncrasy, or you mesh on some point -- the silliness of the name Verizon, a dislike of skiers, a shared fear of heights, the realization that, despite Hollywood, people basically aren't sympathetic -- something. But you don't need to worry about this when twirling the saute pan causes the same result: you have her focus.</p>
        <p>In hopes that my second single life will be an improvement over my first, I have devised a few rules about men cooking for women (which may also apply to men cooking for men and women cooking for women, I don't know).</p>
        <p>1. Find out if she's allergic to anything or hates cardoon. Find out what she loves but seldom gets.</p>
        <p>2. Make something slightly ambitious. Although I prefer simplicity at a restaurant, the perfectly cooked chicken breast is not going to accomplish what you want unless your date is Rose Levy Berenbaum.</p>
        <p>3. Balance the meal -- you don't want it all heavily sauced. (You'll both become ungraceful and possibly unattractive just when you least want to be.)</p>
        <p>4. Serve something exotic -- like cardoon. It looks like celery, tastes like an artichoke and will make you seem a man of the world. Braising leeks will be almost as effective.</p>
        <p>5. Make sure you have plenty of cayenne around in case of emergencies. Cayenne masks just about every conceivable cooking mistake except burning and oversalting, and it's trendy. If you do burn your entree, you may be pleasantly surprised to find that your guest thinks you burned it on purpose to initiate her into cuisine brlee.</p>
        <p>6. Make it appear effortless. Prepare as much as you can beforehand -- but be sure she witnesses at least one impressive cooking flourish. (Throwing things around in a wok is an excellent strategy. Or setting something on fire, or frothing it.) Pour things from a great height. Think Fred Astaire, not one of those grunting tennis players.</p>
        <p>7. Never consult a cookbook in public. Memorize the recipes or post them on little cards and hide them everywhere, as Marlon Brando has done with his lines ever since ''Last Tango.''</p>
        <p>8. Clean your apartment to a better-than-postgraduate level.</p>
        <p>9. Prepare the table with a loaf of delicious bread, a bread knife, a butter plate with a slab of softened butter on it and a shallow bowl half-filled with olive oil, so she'll have a choice of what to put on the bread.</p>
        <p>10. Make sure the woman you're cooking for doesn't have a date later on the same night.</p>
        <p>11. Make these.</p>
        <p>Philippe Bertineau's Chilled Heirloom Tomato Soup  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  1 large leek, white part only, split, rinsed well, coarsely chopped  1 stalk celery, coarsely chopped  1 small bulb fennel, coarsely chopped  1 medium red bell pepper, stemmed, ribs removed, seeded and coarsely chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 medium Spanish onion, coarsely chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 bulb garlic, unpeeled, cut crosswise in half and crushed gently  Herb bouquet garni:  1 sprig thyme, 1 sprig rosemary,  1/4bunch parsley, 3 sprigs basil,  3/4-inch-diameter bundle of dry fennel sticks, all tied together with kitchen string  Seed bouquet garni:  1 tablespoon anise seeds, 1 tablespoon fennel seeds, 1 teaspoon coriander seeds, all placed on a thick square of cheesecloth, gathered into a bundle and tied with kitchen string  15 large, ripe Carmello or beefsteak tomatoes, each cut into 8 pieces  Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste  Tabasco sauce to taste  Celery salt to taste  6 ounces guacamole.</p>
        <p>1. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, add the vegetables (but not the tomatoes). Cover and sweat for 10 minutes, until soft but not brown. Add the bouquets garnis and tomatoes to 3 cups water. Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes, until the tomatoes are softened but not overcooked, then season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>2. Transfer the mixture to a large heatproof bowl and cool in a container of ice and water. (This will allow the tomatoes to retain their color.)</p>
        <p>3. Remove the bouquets garnis and, in batches, puree the mixture in a blender. Pass through a food mill into a large bowl and season to taste with salt, white pepper, Tabasco and celery salt. Refrigerate until cold (but not freezing) to taste the full flavor of the tomatoes.</p>
        <p>4. Ladle the cold tomato soup into soup bowls and place a spoonful of the guacamole in the center and then garnish with a basil flower.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Chicken la Tulipe  1 1/2 ounces dried morels  2 tablespoons Cognac  2 tablespoons butter, divided  1 1/4 cups light cream or cr me frache, divided  1 3 1/2-pound chicken, rinsed (neck, giblets and liver removed)  1 teaspoon salt, divided in half  Pinch of cayenne</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon pepper</p>
        <p>1/4 cup dry white wine.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees and let morels soak in Cognac 15 minutes. Drain, reserving liquid.</p>
        <p>2. Saute morels in 1 tablespoon butter for 5 minutes; then add  1/2 cup light cream and reduce by half. Stir in  1/2 teaspoon salt and the cayenne.</p>
        <p>3. Rub chicken with remaining butter and sprinkle with remaining salt and the pepper. Spoon morels into the body cavity. Roast chicken on one side for 15 minutes, baste and then roast on the other side 15 minutes and baste again. Finally, roast it breast side up for 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>4. Remove chicken from the oven. Throw away most of the fat from the pan, add the wine and mushroomy Cognac, deglazing, and flambe immediately. Reduce over high heat.</p>
        <p>5. Shake morels and juices from the chicken into the pot, add  3/4 cup light cream and simmer for 5 minutes, until thickened. Taste for seasoning.</p>
        <p>6. Cut the chicken into 8 serving pieces, arrange them on the platter and pour the morel sauce over them.</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 servings.</p>
        <p>Braised Cardoon  1 tablespoon butter, in bits  4 cardoon stalks, peeled, split lengthwise and washed well  1 cup beef broth  Salt and freshly ground pepper.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Butter a 1-quart baking dish. Cut cardoon crosswise into  1/2-inch pieces. Place in prepared dish. Add the cardoon to the boiling broth, top with butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>2. Cover tightly with foil and bake, alongside chicken, 20 minutes, until tender.</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 servings.</p>
        <p>Note: Leeks may be substituted for cardoon, with  1/2 cup of broth.</p>
        <p>Baked Figs  6 firm ripe fresh figs  1 1/2 tablespoons butter, melted  1 1/2 tablespoons sugar  Vanilla ice cream or 1 cup raspberries,  1/2 cup heavy cream and  1/4 cup confectioners' sugar.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. Cut the stems off figs and place figs in a buttered baking dish. Brush with butter and sprinkle with sugar. Bake 15 minutes, until bubbly and lightly caramelized.</p>
        <p>3. With scissors or a knife, make an X in the top so that each fig opens like a flower.</p>
        <p>4. Serve figs hot with ice cream or raspberries folded into heavy cream whipped with confectioners' sugar.</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 servings.</p>
