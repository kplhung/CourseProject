        <p>Florida's tax on intangible property, which includes financial assets like stocks, bonds and money market funds, seems on its way to oblivion.</p>
        <p>The tax, collected since 1931, was as much as two mills, or tenths of a percent, of asset value in 1999. That was cut to 1.5 mills this year; a 1-mill rate takes effect in January. State officials are talking about dropping the tax entirely.</p>
        <p>Residents of the state, which has no income tax, must file the mill tax if their financial assets reach $80,000 this year -- $100,000 for a couple filing jointly.</p>
        <p>One implication for the securities market is in municipal bonds. Because the bonds of Florida entities are exempted from the tax, residents have often chosen them over those from outside issuers,  giving up potentially higher yields. At the same time, Florida bonds have often sold at a premium because of their privileged status.</p>
        <p>But now the effect is minimal, said Michael Shamosh, a fixed-income strategist at Gabriele, Hueglin &amp; Cashman.</p>
        <p>''One mill -- who cares any more?'' he asked.</p>
