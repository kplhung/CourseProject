        <p>Call him the $60 million man.</p>
        <p>By the end of next week, Vice President Al Gore will have raised that much for the Democratic National Committee since he locked up the party's nomination in March.</p>
        <p>More than $20 million of that has come in the last 12 days, as Mr. Gore has surged in the polls, catching Gov. George W. Bush. Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, expect to pull in an additional $7 million in the next week, including $1.5 million here tonight and $1.5 million at a dinner in Miami on Monday night.</p>
        <p>It is not clear how much Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, have raised for the Republican National Committee in this period because the Republicans keep those numbers and events under wraps.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the Democratic events are open to at least a small number of reporters, although generally not to cameras. A Republican strategist in Washington said that Republicans preferred to keep their fund-raising quiet because they did not want to feed the stereotype that they were so much richer than the Democrats. Democrats, the strategist said, want the publicity to signal their success and to help persuade other Democrats to give more.</p>
        <p>Tonight's arrangements were typical for Democrats. A large reception was held at the Cadillac Palace Theater, where tickets cost $100, followed by a smaller hotel reception with tickets costing up to $5,000 each. Both events were open to reporters. Then there was a dinner costing $25,000 per couple, with only a few reporters permitted to observe.</p>
        <p>Featured here tonight were Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and former senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Mr. Gore's unsuccessful primary opponent, who introduced him. Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, William M. Daley, brother of the mayor, was on hand but not onstage.</p>
        <p>The candidates received $67 million in federal money for the fall campaign. In exchange, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush cannot raise more for themselves. But they can raise cash for their parties, which will spend the money on their candidacies.</p>
        <p>In August, according to federal figures, Mr. Bush spent $21 million of his $67 million, while Mr. Gore spent about $11 million, leaving Mr. Gore with $10 million more than Mr. Bush in his federal coffer. The money race now is between the parties. The Republicans are pouring more into Mr. Bush's coffers. But Mr. Gore has been turning up the heat under his party's donors, especially since he moved ahead in the polls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore held large fund-raisers on Sept. 12 in Philadelphia, Sept. 13 in Boston and Sept. 14 in New York City, with a total take of nearly $10 million.</p>
        <p>Two events in California this week, one in Hollywood and one in Silicon Valley, brought in $7.7 million, and, combined with tonight's expected $1.5 million, brings the total for the last 12 days to $19.2 million.</p>
