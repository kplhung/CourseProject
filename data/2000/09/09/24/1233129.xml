        <p>FIVE-YEAR-OLD Jake Vitale, balanced confidently on a two-wheeler, careened around a parking lot at the Greenville Elementary School here, nearly clipping his two older brothers as he raced by them.</p>
        <p>His doting, proud and admittedly anxious mother, Donna, watched from the sidelines as her youngest son mastered the skills and thrills of two-wheel independence.</p>
        <p>What made this scene different from similar scenes undoubtedly unfolding in countless other school parking lots on this balmy Friday afternoon?</p>
        <p>Instead of a parent running breathlessly alongside Jake and his bike, the young man who raced beside him was Aresh Mohit, a self-styled bike tutor who, so far as he knows, is the only one in the county engaged in this particular specialty. Mr. Mohit, who has been working as a bike tutor for two years in Westchester and Riverdale, is also the proprietor of CycleServ, a bike specialty business based in Mohegan Lake, which makes house calls for bike repairs, servicing and lessons.</p>
        <p>In a suburban culture where children routinely get extra help with academic subjects, receive private coaching in sports like basketball and soccer to enhance their potential to make a team and take  private music lessons to supplement school instruction, it is not surprising that learning to ride a bike has also become something for professionals to handle.</p>
        <p>Danny Christesen, owner of Danny's Cycles in Scarsdale, a family-owned business that has been outfitting children and their parents with bicycles and related equipment since the 1960's, observed: ''Nowadays, parents are busier. We see more and more older kids of 9 and 10 coming in who either don't know how to ride a bike or don't have a lot of confidence. Aresh seems to have a good way with kids. He's energetic and boosts kids' self-esteem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Christesen, who said that he gets about one request a week for a bike tutor, said: 'People come in and don't know that somebody like that exists. Most people are thrilled that they don't have to ride behind the bike.''</p>
        <p>Some of it may be that aging baby boomers simply aren't up to the physical demands of running alongside a 6-year-old as she learns to ride. And some of it reflects a trend where parents are more comfortable turning to experts to impart certain skills, whether it is soccer or biking, to their offspring.</p>
        <p>''Jake would get frustrated and mad if I told him something, but if Aresh tells him, he gets right back on the bike,'' said Mrs. Vitale, who explained that she was looking forward to having family bike rides along the Bronx River Parkway during coming bike Sundays. ''Some things children learn  better from professionals. Just because I can ride a bike myself doesn't mean that I can teach it. I'm not up to running alongside the bike. My husband is perfectly happy with this method of Jake's learning to ride.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mohit isn't surprised that he has been able to generate a steady client list by word of mouth.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes it's better for a stranger to teach them,'' Mr. Mohit, a 1992 graduate of Scarsdale High School, said. ''The kids want to listen. Parents will say to me, 'We just screamed at each other in the parking lot.' I push them so they know how it feels, but I reassure them and hold them to prevent them from falling. I explain to them that it's not in the arms but in the position of the body and hips, the balance, and that they have to keep their feet moving. They don't learn at my pace, but at their pace.''</p>
        <p>Karen Watts, who lives with her family in  Cortlandt Manor, , was convinced that Mr. Mohit's approach made all the difference when her son, Cooper, now 9, learned to ride.</p>
        <p>''We had gotten all twisted up,'' she said. ''Aresh never pushed the seat or held on to the handle of the bike. He's like a horse whisperer. Five minutes after he started with Aresh, my son was riding. Anything can be explained well by someone. Aresh is like a calm, measured parent, not like the kid's parent.''</p>
        <p>For the most part, Mr. Mohit works with children between 5  and 10, although most of his students are between 6 and 7,  poised to renounce training wheels for adult two-wheelers. He will sometimes give pointers to older children and adults interested in learning how to handle a mountain bike or be better versed in bicycle safety issues.</p>
        <p>His students have to wear helmets, and part of his curriculum includes riding with his young charges in traffic so they  understand how to ride safely alongside cars.</p>
        <p>Most children receive from two to five lessons, depending on their comfort level and aptitude, with lessons running about 45 minutes to an hour. Mr. Mohit charges about $40 a lesson; if there is substantial travel time involved, the fee may be increased. He can be reached at (914) 672-1702.</p>
        <p>''There are a couple of pointers,'' said Mr. Mohit, who admitted that he spent most of his nonschool time at Danny's Cycles in Scarsdale, where he  learned to repair, fit and recondition bikes. ''The key word is momentum, to keep pedaling. Children also need the right size bike. Sometimes it's too big or too small. You need patience and perseverance for both teacher and client, and you also need to know safety. I tell them that they're going to fall and show them how to do it safely.'</p>
        <p>For Jake, the dimming evening light and invitation to play tennis with his brothers couldn't compete with his new-found skill at bike riding. When Mr. Mohit told Jake that the lesson was over for the day, Jake said: ''Let's do one more lap. It feels good, and I was like pedaling and having fun.''</p>
