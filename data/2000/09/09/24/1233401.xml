        <p>''It has taken twice as long to build this monument than it took to fight the war,'' Representative Marcy Kaptur said the other day as the National Capital Planning Commission prepared to approve the National World War II Memorial, which would be  built on the Washington Mall.</p>
        <p>Representative Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio, introduced the bill to build  the memorial 13 years ago and, with approval from Congress, presidents  and commissions, most of the hurdles had been crossed.</p>
        <p>It should be built, she said, before all of the war's veterans have died.  After a public hearing in which 100 people spoke for and against the monument, the commission on Thursday approved it, 7 to 5, a surprisingly close vote. The final approval is expected soon from Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. His approval would set the stage for a groundbreaking presided over by President Clinton on Veterans Day, Nov. 11.</p>
        <p>Bob Dole, the former Kansas senator and the 1996 Republican candidate for president, spoke in his role as chairman of the campaign to build the memorial, urging the commission to approve the monument to the 400,000 Americans killed in World War II and the 800,000 disabled. ''I think they would agree that this is an  appropriate site,'' Mr. Dole said.</p>
        <p>The site is between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, which proponents find appropriate because it links World War II with the heroes of the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. Opponents say it will clutter the Mall, obstructing the views of both memorials.</p>
        <p>Sam Kramer, who said that he went ashore at Utah Beach on D-Day, told the commission, ''I am 78 years old, and I would like to see this  memorial built in my lifetime.''</p>
        <p>He was followed by Virgil M. Davis, who said he was at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, and opposed the memorial. ''My message is to keep the Mall clear,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Opponents have vowed to go to court to try to block the monument,  which organizers hope will open in 2003. The memorial, which was designed by Friedrich St. Florian, is expected to cost $100 million.</p>
