        <p>By 8:25 tonight, you could virtually hear the moths breathing at Olympic Stadium.</p>
        <p>This was the start of the long-awaited women's 100-meter final.</p>
        <p>Suddenly a booming voice penetrated the silence. ''Let's go, Marion!'' roared C. J. Hunter, Marion Jones's husband and bodyguard, and a world-champion shot-putter himself.</p>
        <p>This was the most electric day of track and field. Who are the fastest man and woman in the world? Maurice Greene and Marion Jones.</p>
        <p>Tonight's victory was the first step in Jones's quest to win an unprecedented five gold medals in track and field at one Olympics. Each event will become more difficult than the previous one.</p>
        <p>Asked if she felt relieved now that the first event was out of the way, she said: ''I don't see it as a relief. To me, I'm out here having a ball. This is not a stressful time in my life. This is a very happy time in my life.''</p>
        <p>As the start of the race, Ekaterini Thanou of Greece false-started. Hunter threw his hands up. Then, with moths flying aggressively around the runners' heads, helicopters came buzzing into the area.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't the false start that was so bad,'' Hunter said, ''it was the damn helicopter or whatever it was.''</p>
        <p>Jones had won her heats without being pushed, had won her semifinal without being pushed. Tonight, with camera flashes slashing through the darkness in the 100-meter final, Jones decimated the field. She jumped out of the starting blocks, and by 50 meters the race was over. Her time was 10.75 seconds, and her winning margin, 0.37 seconds over Thanou, was the biggest for a man or a woman since 1952.</p>
        <p>Over the past few days, Jones watched the Games in her apartment. She watched the joyous reaction of gold medal winners as they cried, sank to their knees, praised this deity and that.</p>
        <p>Jones, 24, vowed that when she finished, she was going to keep her cool.</p>
        <p>''When I crossed that line,'' she said, ''all of that was out the window.''</p>
        <p>Jones felt as though she had fallen into a never-never world of uncontrollable celebration. She ran over to her mother, her brother, her uncle and three cousins.</p>
        <p>''Immediately, when I crossed the line I felt joy,'' she said. ''I looked over and I saw my family over there and I pretty much lost it.</p>
        <p>''Ever since I can remember, they've been the ones encouraging me and believing in me. From the beginning they were there, and to see them over there and to have them here in Sydney supporting me -- you couldn't ask for more.''</p>
        <p>Her older brother, Albert Kelly, said he kept thinking about his little sister coming all the way to Sydney.</p>
        <p>''It started with some words on a blackboard,'' he said. ''A goal, she wrote it down on her blackboard and she kept it there, envisioned it and followed her dreams. The whole thing she just wanted to do was make sure that she did the best that she could do, not just for herself, but to bring it home for everyone.''</p>
        <p>Now comes the hard part.</p>
        <p>Hunter ended a news conference by saying, ''We have to start all over again.''</p>
        <p>But Jones is savoring every moment. After the medal ceremony, she stood near the track, examining her medal. She held her gold medal and studied it.</p>
        <p>''I always wanted to know how it felt,'' she said. ''Feels smooth.''</p>
        <p>Jones's victory was smooth as well. She literally leaped out of the blocks and hit the track running. Jones nailed the start. Thanou said she knew after a few steps that she was going for silver.</p>
        <p>''She was too strong,'' Thanou said. ''Even in the preliminaries, you can see this tension.''</p>
        <p>In her first heat today, the semifinals, Jones lined up in the lane next to her teammate Chryste Gaines. The stadium was cold and windy; all the competitors knew about the swirling winds.</p>
        <p>''It's a big factor,'' Gaines said. ''I mean, it's cold out there. And you know when you're trying to fire your muscles up as fast as they can go, you got to rewarm up and come over here.</p>
        <p>''Cold plays with your mind. You think, 'Oh, it'll be just like it is on the warm-up track.' But it's not. Track is a lot mental, so you have to deal with it.''</p>
        <p>The million-dollar question of these Olympics is: Can Marion do it? Can she deal with the cold and the pressure and win five gold medals?</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, her grueling quest continues:</p>
        <p>Jones has to run two 200-meter qualifying rounds as well as compete in a long-jump qualifying round. On Thursday, she has the 200-meter final, and on Friday she has the long jump final and qualifying heats for the 4x100 and 4x400 relays.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Hunter put it all in context: One medal down, four to go. Can she do it? Nothing he saw tonight was discouraging. Hunter even compared Jones to the United States men's basketball team.</p>
        <p>''If she performs as well as she can perform in all of her events, nobody else is close to that,'' he said. ''That's just as simple as it is. It's like the Dream Team.</p>
        <p>''If the basketball team goes out and plays as well as they can possibly play -- nothing against the other country -- what can they do? If they don't play well, they can lose; if she doesn't compete well, she can lose.''</p>
