        <p>Finally, Honored by His Own</p>

        <p>Finally, Honored by His Own</p>
        <p>Museums around the country own photographs by Jed Devine -- the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, the San Francisco Museum of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago, to name a few. But Mr. Devine, a professor of art at Purchase College, has never shown at the college's Neuberger Museum of Art until now. His current exhibition, ''Objects of Reflection,'' is on view through Dec. 31.</p>
        <p>Mr. Devine, who has taught photography at Purchase for 24 years, credits the museum's associate director for curatorial affairs, Judy Collischan, with showcasing his art at the Neuberger. She writes in an essay, ''Devine's rigorous and uncompromising approach is exacting, tyrannical and masterful. It is a philosophical approach centering on apprehension, principle and thought.''</p>
        <p>If that sounds off-putting, the exhibition isn't. The 64 black and white pictures, produced with the same palladium printing process used by artists like Alfred Steiglitz, Paul Strand, Edward Weston and Edward Steichen, are full of quiet and haunting moments. Look for two pictures hung one above the other, the top one nearly all white and the bottom one nearly all black. A faint line of trees in the whiteness denotes a snowy landscape; a full moon and its reflections reveal the darkness to be water. The rich blacks in the photographs were achieved with palladium printing, a nonsilver process in which paper is hand coated with platinum and palladium salts.</p>
        <p>Unlike the light-sensitive silver process, which requires a darkroom, palladium printmaking can take place in daylight. Mr. Devine said he prefers the method because ''the prints look better, and I like making them better.''</p>
        <p>Reading On, After Harry Potter</p>
        <p>The truth now: aren't librarians just the teensiest bit resentful of the Harry Potter craze? After all, it's not as though J. K. Rowling is the first children's author to come along, and librarians have been trying to get children to read for decades.</p>
        <p>No, said Judith Rovenger, youth services consultant for the Westchester Library System. The Harry Potter craze is a very good thing. ''The books are a lot of fun,'' Ms. Rovenger said, ''and Harry Potter only brings more attention to other books.''</p>
        <p>The library system recently distributed a useful booklet with cozy cover art by Robert Casilla. The booklet, ''Outstanding Books, 2000: Books to Share,'' lists 88 books for toddlers through junior high school students, chosen by a committee of seven children's librarians. To make their selections, the committee sifted through more than 3,000 of the 4,000 new children's titles published last year.</p>
        <p>''These are books that librarians are dying to share,'' Ms. Rovenger said. ''We want to make note of books that are so wonderful that we don't want kids to miss them.''</p>
        <p>These include the series ''A Series of Unfortunate Events,'' by Lemony Snicket; ''The Dark Is Rising,'' a series by Susan Cooper; ''The Lost Flower Children,'' by Janet Taylor Lisle; and ''Landry News,'' by Andrew Clements.</p>
        <p>The library system posts items for children on the Web site www.wls.lib.ny.us/ owls/.</p>
        <p>A Meeting of Minds on Film</p>
        <p>News of the 914 Film &amp; Video Group generally spreads quietly, but the group is hoping to make waves with its first meeting of the fall.</p>
        <p>''Independent Filmmaking: Its Past, Present and Future'' will be presented free on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in Lecture Hall C-100 of Westchester Community College in Valhalla. The meeting, which will feature the speakers Marshall Fine, a nationally syndicated film critic and entertainment writer for The Journal News and the Gannett News Service, and Vincent LoBrutto, a faculty member at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan and an author of several books, including a biography of Stanley Kubrick, is being held in cooperation with the college's media arts department.</p>
        <p>''We tend to attract a lot of hyphenates,'' said Jonathan Kaplan, organizer of the four-year-old group; namely ''writer-directors, writer-producers and writer-editors,'' along with some composers, actors and students.</p>
        <p>''We've always been a bit under the radar screen here in the county, as we don't receive any outside funding,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''We don't strictly fit into any categorizable group -- not really theater, writing or art, although we encompass all those things -- so we sort of go overlooked.'' Information: (914) 948-3447.</p>
