        <p>WORKING with natural stone can be a rewarding experience because a project finished in stone has a rustic charm that is unmatched in any other building material. Stone is easy to work with because it requires minimal dressing and shaping, although gathering and positioning stones calls for a lot of muscle and sweat.</p>
        <p>The novice stone builder can acquire the necessary skills for stone construction by tackling a relatively simple project like building stone steps up the side of a low hill. Such a project not only enhances the landscape but it also can be functional if you have property on two levels.</p>
        <p>Obviously the first step is to acquire the stone. Where can you get natural stone? If you have a large piece of property, you may find that you have enough rocks in your own backyard.</p>
        <p>Construction sites are another source of free stone. Builders often collect rocks when they excavate the ground for a foundation. If you ask the builder, he may give you the stones if you offer to haul them away.</p>
        <p>You can also find stones and rocks in fields and woodlands around your home. Do not, however, assume that stones are free for the taking simply because they are lying in a vacant field. The land belongs to somebody and so do the stones. Always ask permission before attempting to gather stones from anyone's property.</p>
        <p>Stones are heavy and even a small load can weigh enough to tax the suspension system of a car; if possible rent a pickup . Before loading the stones, lay down a sheet of plywood on the truck bed to protect it from dents and abrasion.</p>
        <p>It is a good idea to carry along a pry bar and a shovel to help you dislodge and uncover stones embedded in the dirt. And, if possible, bring a wheelbarrow to help you move heavy rocks to the truck.</p>
        <p>There are a few hazards involved in gathering stone in the wild. Be wary when pulling any stone from a hill or a cliff. This could start a landslide. Be sure of your footing as you move over rugged terrain so you do not slip or fall. In addition to looking for rocks, keep a sharp eye out for snakes, wasps and poison ivy. Finally, enlist the aid of a helper. In addition to helping you move heavy rocks, he can help you in the event of an accident or injury.</p>
        <p>You can also purchase stone at a commercial stoneyard. Obviously this costs more than gathering your own pieces, but it's a lot easier because the dealer does all the heavy work, including delivery. Even if you can get the bulk of your rocks from a free source, it is well worth visiting a stone yard to find interesting and colorful rocks that can highlight your project as a supplement to those available in local fields.</p>
        <p>Once the stone is on site, you can begin construction. Use flat stones that are at least 24-inches wide for the steps. You can use two stones together to make the tread, but avoid, if possible, using three or more stones for one step. This combination can make the steps uneven and unsteady.</p>
        <p>Stone steps need more tread (the measure from the front lip to the back of the step) than normal steps. Normal steps can have a 9-inch tread, but stone steps should be at least 12 inches from front to back; 16 inches is even better.</p>
        <p>If the stones are too big or if their surfaces are too irregular, you can dress them with a hammer and chisel. Place the stone on soft ground and use a cold chisel and hammer -- either a ball pein (also called a machinist's hammer) or a drilling hammer (also called a hand sledge) -- to chip away at the lumps and high spots on the rock surface. Work carefully because natural stone has veins and cracks that could easily open up and split the rock when struck with a hammer and chisel.</p>
        <p>Start at the bottom of the hill and dig out enough dirt to fit the first step plus an additional six inches for a gravel bed. The gravel bed is not essential, but it will provide a solid base for the stone and a drainage path for ground water. Place the stone so the front edge is slightly lower than the back. This incline will allow rainwater to run off the steps.</p>
        <p>Once the bottom step is in place, excavate above it for the next step and gravel bed. This step should overlap the lower one to keep ground water from under cutting the stones. Use the same technique to dig back into the slope for the remaining steps.</p>
