        <p>AFTER 35 years in public service, Salvatore A. DeSantis, who led efforts to protect the biodiversity of Westchester's nature preserves, is retiring.</p>
        <p>''It's a little disconcerting after all this time,'' Mr. DeSantis, the county parks commissioner, said this week, reflecting on the rewards and frustrations of a government career. ''Now, without my desk, a phone, my beeper and the prestige that comes with the job, I'll just be Sal DeSantis, the citizen.''</p>
        <p>In a gazebo overlooking fields of wildflowers at Muscoot Farms here, a place he often visits to shake off the pressures of the job, the 54-year-old commissioner said he was stepping away from public life with a mixture of emotions -- ''relief, exhilaration and a little bit of worry.'' As rewarding as it has been, public life has also been filled with frustrations, which is why he is quitting more than a decade before traditional retirement age.</p>
        <p>In his current job, he has straddled two administrations, for the most part receiving bipartisan praise for his accomplishments as the steward of more than 40 parks and 17,000 acres of open space.</p>
        <p>He is given credit for rebuilding the 777-acre educational farm here; establishing a Chinese Culture Garden and Friendship Pavilion at Lasdon Park and Arboretum, also in Somers; rehabilitating the county's five aging golf courses and streamlining reservation procedures and playing times, and introducing a program to identify and protect environmentally sensitive areas in Westchester.</p>
        <p>The first biodiversity inventory survey was completed in 1997 at Ward Pound Ridge Reservation in Cross River, in which several rare wildlife species thought to be extinct in the county were discovered. Based on the results of the survey, Biodiversity Protection Areas were also set aside at Cranberry Lake Preserve in North White Plains.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeSantis is also responsible for hiring more nature curators and expanding the county's nature centers.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Mr. DeSantis has drawn up a master plan for the parks system, which at the time of his retirement includes five swimming pools, three beaches, four miniature golf courses, seven nature preserves, two historic sites, two children's summer music camps and three recreational trailways, in addition to the parks and golf courses.</p>
        <p>He began his career as a parks administrator in 1971 for the city of Rye. He held similar positions for the town of North Castle. A graduate of Manhattan College, Mr. DeSantis holds a master of arts degree in recreation administration from New York University.</p>
        <p>Now he is looking ahead to retirement and private life. ''My family has sacrificed a lot over the years because of my work,'' he said, explaining that 80-hour work weeks have kept him from spending more time with his wife, Loretta, and his two grown children. His retirement is effective Oct. 12.</p>
        <p>He says he is tired too of the lack of privacy and the persistent inquisitiveness of reporters. For example, when Mr. DeSantis, who was the former parks commissioner in Yonkers, was named to his current job by Andrew P. O'Rourke, who was then the county executive, the county was criticized for failing to conduct a wider search. The appointment was considered by some to be political, because both Mr. O'Rourke and Mr. DeSantis were from Yonkers.</p>
        <p>''The press can't help being the press -- they're only doing their job -- but the lack of privacy and always being quoted does wear on one after a while,'' he said. ''I want some peace, some serenity now.''</p>
        <p>The state's new incentive program for early retirements among civil service employees has also prodded him to leave. (Mr. DeSantis's early retirement may be the first of others to come, similarly prompted by the state incentives, said Susan Tolchin, a spokeswoman for County Executive Andrew J. Spano.)</p>
        <p>Mr. DeSantis said he plans to work as a government consultant. He has also been teaching classes in recreational program planning at Mercy College and hopes to expand his role in higher education.</p>
        <p>Most of all, though, he wants to ''go out while I'm still hot,'' he said. ''I don't believe in waiting around until obsolescence.''</p>
