        <p>WHEN the last speaker sat down sometime after 4 a.m. on Sept. 8, ending one of the longest public hearings ever in the town of Oyster Bay, there was agreement on only this: the former Cerro Wire and Cable Company plant near Syosset was a blight and had to go.</p>
        <p>What should rise next on the industrially zoned acreage, which is next to the Long Island Expressway but also at the borders of residential communities, has remained, in the days since the hearing, at the center of one of the most stubbornly fought development battles on Long Island in years.</p>
        <p>Consultants and representatives for Taubman Centers, a mall developer based in Bloomfield, Mich., which is seeking to make its debut in Long Island's rich retail market, argued at the hearing that nothing could be better or economically wiser than replacing the derelict industrial plant on the 39-acre site with a top-of-the-line shopping mall. Taubman has been trying for six years to gain approval, and a Town Board decision is now expected within two months.</p>
        <p>The property was acquired in 1989 by the Tribune Company of Chicago as a potential site for a printing plant for The Daily News. The Tribune company no longer owns The Daily News but now owns Newsday.</p>
        <p>Built in 1950's, the Cerro plant manufactured electrical conduits and copper rods. In 1993 the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation declared the site, by then unused, an inactive hazardous waste site. It was removed from the list after a cleanup in 1994.</p>
        <p>To be called the Mall at Oyster Bay, the 860,000 square-foot retail center -- scaled back from nearly one million square feet in an earlier proposal -- would hold Long Island's first Neiman-Marcus, other major stores whose identity Taubman has yet to disclose and an array of expensive smaller stores and shops.</p>
        <p>''We are talking about a mall the likes of which Long Island has never seen,'' said Gary Lewi, a public relations professional from Syosset and a spokesman for Taubman, speaking in the days after the hearing.</p>
        <p>More than just shopping is at stake, Taubman says. The mall would mean more than 2,000 construction jobs and tens of millions in tax revenues -- including more than $6 million for financially ailing Nassau County -- during construction. Once operating, Taubman estimates, the mall would directly generate more than $45 million annually in salaries, $7.3 million in property taxes and $14.3 million in sales tax revenues. Annual property taxes would include $375,181 for the town of Oyster Bay and $3.9 million for the Syosset School District. And, incidentally, the Cerro blight would be wiped away.</p>
        <p>But the neighbors and their supporters are adamantly opposed to Taubman's project and came by the hundreds to the marathon hearing, presenting their own consultants, who urged rejection of the plan.</p>
        <p>Leaders of local civic groups said they would prefer a high-tech park, light industry, an office complex, senior-citizen housing, even a recreational facility. Traffic from the mall, they said, would wreak havoc on their middle- and upper-middle-income neighborhoods. The generally accepted estimate of the traffic generated by the mall is 24,000 cars on an average day.</p>
        <p>The site, the opponents said, is particularly ill suited for a mall because poor access would inevitably funnel large volumes of traffic through local streets and, dangerously, over a grade-level Long Island Rail Road crossing. Mall traffic would also overburden larger commercial thoroughfares like Jericho Turnpike, they said.</p>
        <p>''The neighborhoods' entire quality of life will be forever destroyed,'' said Howard Avrutine of Syosset, a lawyer for the Birchwood Civic Association, a group representing a neighborhood near the proposed mall.</p>
        <p>In a well-organized and dogged campaign, the opponents say they have broadened their ranks to include more than 20 civic associations, two local school boards -- including the Syosset school board -- and, by their count, 25,000 families in a wide radius around the proposed mall site.</p>
        <p>THE Nassau County Chambers of Commerce, representing 6,000 businesses, has also joined the opposition. Members fear the mall will hurt existing retailers, including smaller businesses along Jericho Turnpike.</p>
        <p>''They all recognize the devastation this project would cause,'' said Kevin Ryan, president of Ryan &amp; Ryan, a public relations firm in Farmingdale, who has worked two years for the Birchwood Civic Association.</p>
        <p>The opponents are unimpressed by Taubman's assertions that the mall would fill a high-end shopping need in Nassau County beyond that already filled by the Americana at Manhasset and other malls.</p>
        <p>''There are so many malls in every direction,'' said Leonard A. Gutterman of the West Birchwood Civic Association. ''We just question the need for another.''</p>
        <p>The seven members of the Oyster Bay Town Board must now decide whether to grant Taubman a special permit to allow construction of the mall in an industrial area, the subject of the hearing. Supervisor John Venditto said last week he expected the board would act within two months.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Venditto and principals for and against the mall said that regardless of the board's decision, they expected appeals in the courts. Mr. Venditto said the board would strive to write a decision that would withstand a legal challenge. ''We are elected to make decisions about zoning,'' Mr. Venditto said. ''We should be the ones to decide what goes on in the streets of this town.''</p>
        <p>Residents opposing the mall vowed to defeat town board members if they fail to heed antimall sentiment.</p>
        <p>Taubman's representatives said groups that have opposed the mall were using public relations techniques to make themselves look bigger and influence the outcome.</p>
        <p>Morton Weber, a lawyer on Long Island for Taubman, said the number of opponents had swelled in recent months by no more than ''maybe a hundred people or so'' despite the groups' recruiting efforts. The opponents scoffed at this. ''It sounds like he is getting desperate,'' Mr. Ryan said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Weber said he believed the primary opponent to the mall was not nearby residents, but rather Simon Properties of Indianapolis, the largest mall owner in the country and a Taubman competitor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weber said Mr. Ryan still represented Roosevelt Field in Garden City, a Simon property, and suggested that Simon might be helping to finance residents' opposition, which has included a direct mail campaign and a full-page advertisement in Newsday.  On Long Island, Simon also owns the Mall at the Source in Westbury, Walt Whitman in Huntington and Smithhaven Mall in Lake Grove.</p>
        <p>Billie Scott, a Simon spokeswoman in Indianapolis, said, ''The suggestion that we are manipulating the situation for a competitive purpose is an attempt to divert attention away from the real issue, namely traffic.'' She said Simon retained Mr. Ryan about two years ago to do public relations work for the four Simon-owned malls but had no part in his work on behalf of the Birchwood Civic Association in opposing the Taubman mall.</p>
        <p>Asked if Simon had made any financial contribution to the opponents, she replied, ''I can't comment on the level of support, if any, that has been provided by Simon.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ryan said he was not being paid by Simon for his work with the civic association. ''This whole Simon thing is smoke and mirrors,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A leader of residents opposing the Taubman mall, Todd Fabricant of the East Birchwood Association in Jericho and a Cerro Wire coalition committee, said he had ''no communication with the Simon organization.'' He said financing for the fight against what he called ''a very poor plan for this site'' had come from dues residents paid to organizations opposed to the project.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ryan said Taubman had enlisted union construction workers in its efforts by ''selling them a bill of goods'' about union jobs the project would provide. ''We have never been antidevelopment; we have just been antimall,'' Mr. Ryan said. He said whatever was built at the site would provide construction jobs.</p>
        <p>Construction workers favoring the Taubman mall were among more than 1,500 people who attended the Oyster Bay hearing. John M. Kennedy, the president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, said that Mr. Weber and another Taubman official had ''made a commitment to use local union contractors and craftspeople.''</p>
        <p>Taubman, like Simon a real estate investment trust, was founded by A. Alfred Taubman in 1950 and owns shopping malls with a combined total of 27 million square feet of retail space in 12 states.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, Taubman owns the Mall at Short Hills, with 1.35 million square feet of retail space. The company's malls in Connecticut include the 573,000-square foot Stamford Town Center, and Westfarms, near Hartford, with 1.29 million square feet.</p>
        <p>As residents vow that Taubman will never build a mall at the Cerro site, a wild card has yet to be played. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which has powers of condemnation, has named a portion of the property as the possible site of a new rail storage yard that will be needed to store trains overnight as the Long Island Railroad increases service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weber said a rail yard would make the mall impossible but suggested that residents would prefer the mall to the trains. The residents were not ready to concede that. ''We are open to many other types of development,'' Mr. Fabricant said.</p>
