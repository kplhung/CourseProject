        <p>FIRST, a confession. David C. (his real name) and his wife once took two young children to dine in a fancy restaurant.</p>
        <p>It was a lovely place, on a seashore, with sweeping views and dramatic lighting and romantic silences and hand-printed menus and hand-painted place settings and . . . he remembers nothing about the meal except Daniel, 7, and Katie, 4, filling every one of those silences with giggles, shrieks, whimpers, howls, multiple restroom visits, wrestling holds and even more extreme behavior, involving croutons and water glasses, that cannot be described here until we are sure the statute of limitations has expired.</p>
        <p>Mistakes were made, all right?</p>
        <p>In the seven summers since that regrettable incident, David has become a restaurant critic, and Daniel and Katie, now 14 and 11, have matured into paragons of patience and decorum. Now he'll take them anywhere -- well, almost anywhere.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, more has changed in those seven years than just that everyone is older.</p>
        <p>The dining world is changing too, becoming far more hospitable to children, even the very young. And parents, learning from their peers or from their own instinct and experience, seem to be getting smarter about managing their meals out.</p>
        <p>These changes are driven by a perceptible shift in the culture -- a gradual but welcome lightening of the solemn mood that used to cling to ''fine dining'' like an ermine cloak -- as well as by demographics and economic necessity.</p>
        <p>''You have to realize what's going on and change with it,'' said Ken Gebhardt, who with his brother, Buddy, owns the highly regarded Park and Orchard restaurant in East Rutherford. ''The couples who used to go out to eat four or five times a week 10 years ago are having kids. You have to welcome them, or they won't go out.''</p>
        <p>A few definitions are in order here. ''Dining'' is not the same as ''eating.'' We are not talking about McDonald's or Chuck E. Cheese, indispensable as those places are, but about restaurants where adults might reasonably expect to spend an hour or more eating individually prepared dishes, perhaps with a glass of wine, having adult conversations about adult topics (like their daughter's latest soccer game) and gazing into each other's eyes.</p>
        <p>''Children,'' for the purpose of this article, means preschool children. By the age of 6 or 7, most children can sit still for most of a meal without lapsing into aggressively annoying behavior, particularly if no younger brother or sister is around to egg them on.</p>
        <p>Indeed, for a first or second grader, an evening at a fine restaurant can be an overwhelmingly positive experience for everyone involved.</p>
        <p>''There's something wonderful about taking a 6- or 8-year-old out for dinner,'' said Dr. Joy Browne, the call-in psychologist on radio station WOR in New York, whom I interviewed because I'd once heard her taking a hard line against young children in restaurants. ''Different food, different setting, fancy silverware, and someone who treats them very well and puts a napkin in their lap. It teaches patience, good manners, elegance -- all those grown-up things that are in short supply. The problem is people who take very young children, who can't sit still, make a lot of noise and run through the restaurant, ruining everyone else's romantic night out.''</p>
        <p>And of course, all children are different. Your 3-year-old, for example, is far better behaved than your best friend's twins, who regularly throw tantrums when they aren't removing articles of clothing.</p>
        <p>Leslie Brenner, a novelist and food writer in Brooklyn who responded to a query for this article on the Web site Chowhound.com, says she has had reasonable success with her 3 1/2-year-old son, Wylie, but she marveled one night at a 3-year-old girl in the high-end Manhattan restaurant Daniel, ''sitting there very primly between her parents, looking just like a doll.''</p>
        <p>Within those limits, here are some tips, gleaned from interviews with restaurant owners, veteran diners and others, for baby-sitter-challenged parents warily contemplating a night out with a small child or two.</p>
        <p>CHOOSING A RESTAURANT  These days, almost all restaurants but those at the highest end claim to be child-friendly; they can hardly afford not to be. Many offer children's menus; many have high chairs and booster seats. ''A co-worker who used to wait tables says keeping the kids happy is one of the best ways to get a higher tip,'' noted John Piekarski of Denville, an online editor who with his wife often takes their 2-year-old out to eat.</p>
        <p>Apart from any economic motivation, many restaurant owners, chefs, managers and servers genuinely like children and do their best to make them feel at home. Mr. Gebhardt, of Park and Orchard, says that when children finish eating before their parents do, waiters will happily taken them on a tour of the kitchen, which includes carnival attractions like giant mixers and a refrigerator big enough to stand up in.</p>
        <p>(On the other hand, an e-mail correspondent told me of a headwaiter at a snooty restaurant in Greenwich Village who was overheard telling a customer: ''Yes, madam, we do serve children here. On pita bread.'')</p>
        <p>But while most restaurants are at least tolerant of small diners, some kinds of places seem to have a higher batting average than others. ''Ethnic'' restaurants -- a term that encompasses African-American, Asian, Latino and Middle Eastern but not, for some reason, French or Italian -- are generally comfortable with young children, perhaps because they tend to be family-run. Such restaurants often incorporate their own amusements: fish tanks, tortilla makers, fortune cookies.</p>
        <p>Some parents look for restaurants with banquettes, where a child can lie down without attracting other diners' attention. And high noise levels, so often an impediment to an enjoyable meal, can be great camouflage for the fussing of an impatient toddler. Jon Shure of Ewing, the president of a policy think tank in Trenton, remembers taking his son, then 1 year old, to Obrycki's, the famed crab house in Baltimore. ''Everybody was talking loudly and pounding the tables with mallets,'' he said. ''Joseph fit right in.''</p>
        <p>PLANNING AHEAD  Most children eat early. So it pays to reserve early -- 5 p.m., if that's when the restaurant opens -- and to call ahead to warn the staff that children will be along. That way, you can be seated in a corner, out of harm's way, said Sam Nativo, chef and owner of Uptown in Long Branch, who added, ''If a family comes in at 8 with three little kids, we seat them, but we try to calm the other customers.''</p>
        <p>Virtually every parent who responded to my Internet query suggested carrying along some tools of the trade: crayons, drawing paper, Magna Doodle, even a small reseaable bag of Legos. Others recommended a pre-emptive strike against the crankiness that comes with hunger pangs. ''Go to the drive-through window at McDonald's, get her a Happy Meal and make sure she finishes it before we get to the restaurant,'' said Pete Feliz, a Bronx man who works as a doorman in Manhattan, about his daughter, Vicky, now 9. ''She becomes more cooperative and adventurous if she's got a Happy Meal under her belt.''</p>
        <p>SETTING AN ATTITUDE  Long before the evening out, it may be possible to find out whether the child and fine dining are ready for each other. ''Set up a table in the kitchen,'' said Dr. Browne, the psychologist. ''Put out candles, silver, china, water glasses, and bring in the neighborhood baby sitter to serve. If the kid behaves well, fine. If not, don't even think of taking her out for another year.''</p>
        <p>Attitude matters in the restaurant, too.</p>
        <p>''Parental control is key,'' said Deborah Roark, the food and beverage director of the Birmingham Athletic Club in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., who has a 3-year-old daughter of her own. ''If the parent is not willing to supervise the child, no one has a good experience.''</p>
        <p>Several parents echoed that thought, but Ms. Brenner, the writer in Brooklyn, offered a variation. When she and her husband take 3-year-old Wylie out, they try to get everyone on their side: staff, fellow diners and, of course, Wylie himself.</p>
        <p>''Taking a hard edge is exactly the wrong approach,'' she said. ''Kids are so willful, they're going to react against you. If you can generate some enthusiasm, make the child excited, he'll rise to the occasion. He'll see it as a special experience and want to do it another time.''</p>
