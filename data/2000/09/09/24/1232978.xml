        <p>''Baby, the wheel turns slowly,'' my grandmother used to say, ''but it does turn.'' Which is why I'm here, spending a particularly gloomy and humid August day in 20-below conditions in downtown Detroit. That is no misprint -- 20 degrees below 0 -- because I'm working in the freezer of the Melody Farms dairy.</p>
        <p>My father labored at the Wilson dairy, which was absorbed by Melody Farms in 1983. He worked in the load-out -- unloading plastic crates filled with dairy products -- as well as in a little laundry, which is no longer in business. He retired in 1985. Now I'm working both his jobs, at a dairy plant as well as a laundry, to get some sense of what he went through, the journey he and my mother made. My father bought me freedom; he worked like a convict most of his adult life and never complained about it, barely missing a day. ''Are you sure you want to do this?'' asks Stephen George, vice president of product development at Melody Farms, who was kind enough to fill my dilettante's request and let me work a shift at his plant. Somewhere in my heart I have always wondered if I could live up to my father's example.</p>
        <p>My parents moved to Detroit from Hattiesburg, Miss., in 1949. My father was unable to find work at any of the auto plants, so he got a job at the Michigan milk-bottle exchange, and later at Wilson Dairy. By the time he was my age -- 41 -- he and my mother were raising five children, including infant twins. About that time, he got a second job at the laundry, taking on as many hours as he could get. Which meant that sometimes he worked only four hours on any given day and sometimes he put in a full shift. He could be on his feet lifting and hauling heavy boxes or heaving large piles of sopping-wet tablecloths and uniforms for up to 16 hours, a feat he sometimes pulled off five days a week until he opted to take his retirement. And by then the number of children had swelled to nine, including a second set of twins.</p>
        <p>Me ... um, I go to the movies for a living, and I write about them for this newspaper. This is a job that makes about as much sense to my father as mining the moon for cheese. Whenever my uncles came by the house, my dad would call me over and ask me to show them my hands. And they laughed as if Flip Wilson as Geraldine were doing a private show just for them. Given the smoothness of my hands, they probably thought playing Geraldine was a marginally more masculine occupation. God knows, it paid better.</p>
        <p>Art Radtke, who works at Melody Farms, once worked at Wilson alongside my father. ''Oh, yeah, I remember Lou,'' says Radtke, a genial cat with flecks of gray in his mustache. ''Louie, we called him. He was a talker, your dad. And he worked, too, went in on whatever shift they asked him to do. Cleaning milk crates, load-out, whatever. He was there.''</p>
        <p>Talking with Art brings to mind a conversation I once had with my father. My first job out of college was at The Oakland Press in Pontiac, where I was the one-man TV staff -- I edited and laid out the TV-listings book and daily page and wrote several times a week. At one point, I watched all of a 15-hour miniseries, ''The Winds of War,'' and wrote the review in time for the next day's deadline. Feeling immensely proud, I stopped by my parents' house to brag. ''So,'' I said, settling into a chair across from my father, ''what'd you do today?'' ''Well, Sugarfoot, on Wednesday,'' my father started -- and this was Friday, so I rolled my eyes and prepared for a meandering story -- I was going to work and that Warren bus wasn't running, so I had to walk to the plant. I put in my shift, and one of the men couldn't make it in, so I did his shift. Then I came home and went to the laundry. Got up and the Warren bus wasn't running again, I had to walk to the plant again ...''</p>
        <p>At the end of this story, I realized that my 62-year-old father had been up and on his feet working for 48 hours, and had walked a mile and a half in the snow a couple of times. He looked at me and said, ''What did you do?'' I had sat in a warm room where I'd eaten sandwiches and watched TV. ''Um, nothing,'' I said, standing to leave. ''Nothing at all.'' The lessons I learned from him are that there are no bad jobs, and that hard work never killed anybody, though it might make you wish you were dead.</p>
        <p>My first shift, at the laundry room of the Residence Inn in Southfield, Mich., takes place on a Sunday morning, the tail end of a busy summer weekend. My youngest sister, Delana, used to work here, and made a call to the general manager to get me in. As I stare at the pile of damp towels and face cloths in the bin, Teresa, my no-nonsense co-worker, says: ''Make sure you put on a pair of rubber gloves. And wash your hands after you finish, even though you got gloves on.'' Thinking back on what many people do on weekends in hotels, I quickly pull on a pair of gloves. Attacking my work with the abandon of an amateur zealot, I grab huge clumps of towels and shove them in the big industrial washer. I feel the clamminess on my bare forearms and think of having them cauterized. Or at the very least grabbing a bar of Lava, the workingman's soap my dad used. After turning on the machine -- Teresa stands behind me to make sure I hit the buttons in the proper sequence -- I run to the sink and lather up with the liquid soap, which leaves my hands gray and mottled.</p>
        <p>We move to a table to fold the bundles of sheets fresh from the dryer. I spoke to my father after finishing my imitation of labor and the first two things he said were: ''If you needed to work for free, you could've come out here to Phoenix and do my laundry,'' and ''Do you even fold your own sheets at home?'' Yes, I do fold my own sheets. But not so quickly that it could be like the fast-forward motion of a fabric-softener commercial, which is the way Teresa neatly smoothes out the linen and tucks it into compact stacks. Eventually, she moves me out of the way because ''it's busy here and you take too long.'' I add more time to her job because she ends up having to refold my work. ''Go take those towels out of the washer and put 'em in the dryer,'' she says, whipping through the mound of sheets in a blur.</p>
        <p>''I know this looks easy,'' she notes, ''but it takes time to learn any system. It took me a couple of days to get it all.'' Folding and stacking the towels is something I can do, and that requires a minimum of correction from Teresa. I become reasonably adept at the towel part of the job, folding bath towels, hand towels, face cloths and bathmats, stacking them and putting them on the shelves. I limit myself to tasks that won't throw Teresa too far behind. I don't delude myself that I'm any good at this. Teresa gets through this job every day without any assistance from well-meaning interlopers. But by the end of my shift, I feel as if I'm helping a little, which Teresa eventually acknowledges. I look up at the clock and see that I've put in an extra 45 minutes. ''You weren't going to say anything, ''I joke. ''No, I can use all the help I can get,'' she laughs, ''and you weren't so bad with the towels.''</p>
        <p>I'm moving slowly when I get back to the hotel that night. There's a nasty little stab in my back when I move the wrong way and my arms feel like somebody else's lifeless limbs are surgically attached to my shoulders. With my father working two shifts a day, it wasn't often that I got to see him at night. One night, I remember, he walked into the house bloody and ashamed; he'd been blindsided, mugged by a couple of guys who were made even angrier by the small amount of change he had in his pockets. The next day, at 5 a.m., he was getting ready for work as if nothing had happened, brewing up a pot of his chuck-wagon coffee, a liquid so dark that even a pint of half-and-half seemed unable to render it au lait. I used to get up with him in the morning when I was a boy. It was the one moment of the day we had together. He'd pour me a cup of that vile stuff and load it up with cream and sugar for me, and I'd gamely try to drink it. ''See you tonight, Sugarfoot'' -- his nickname for me, which we got from some old western TV series -- and I'd get a pat on the head as he was on his way out the door.</p>
        <p>Driving over to the ice cream plant the next day, I check the time and it occurs to me that I'm wearing a watch -- a 1971 Bulova Accutron -- similar to one my twin sister and I had given my father for his birthday years ago. He has a drawer full of watches I've given him over the years, which he likes so much that not only does he rarely wear them but he also still keeps them in their box. I feel more like an idiot than ever and take the watch off, so that I won't be constantly reminded whenever I look at my wrist that I'm trying to be half the man he was. And given the strain in my lower back right about now, I feel like half a man.</p>
        <p>At the Melody Farms ice cream plant, I'm allowed to try a couple of things, like pouring the butter pecan flavoring into one of the vats. Slowly pouring a stream of the flavoring, my left biceps starts to twitch. As we walk around the plant, I'm nervous and a little embarrassed. I don't want to let him down, and my left biceps flutters like a hummingbird with the D.T.'s, a spasm of anxiety about the imminent task at hand, small-time though it may be. I know that I don't want to let my dad down, even though he wouldn't mind. He's the happiest retired man in the world; whenever I talk to him in Phoenix, where he now lives after enduring over 40 Michigan winters, he's always watching the Jerry Springer show or Judge Judy -- apparently, there's a channel devoted to running just those shows. ''I thought it was your job to watch those shows,'' he avers, whenever I tell him that I missed today's compelling ''Mama, keep your hands off my man'' episode of ''Springer.'' It's great to spar with him about TV, and wonderful to know that he now has time on his hands. Before, he mostly caught Tigers games on Saturdays and on Sundays after church, a place where our family spent so much time that when I was a kid I thought it was a part-time job.</p>
        <p>Steve suggests I work the loading area for the first part of my shift and come into the processing area for the second half. I now have the ... well, maybe ''opportunity'' isn't exactly the word I'm looking for, but the chance to do what my father did. That is, lift boxes and crates, the point of this exercise. I arrive the next morning at 10 after 5, and Bob, who runs the loading area, gives me a hard time. ''I don't know your dad, but I bet he wasn't late on his first day,'' he says with a smile. I don't have the nerve to tell him I'm late because the valet parking attendant at my hotel couldn't find my car. I feel superficial enough as it is, and slip my wristwatch -- not the Accutron, but a Heuer Monaco, which makes me feel even more privileged -- into my pocket and get outfitted in heavy, padded blue overalls and a blue parka. It's pretty cool-looking, the kind of gear rappers are paying top dollar for, but it's not a fashion statement -- it's to ward off the cold in the storage area. The docks are kept at 40 degrees, so that the frozen products won't melt as they're being put on the trucks that will take them to supermarkets and stores. My first job is to sweep off the docks. At last, I am given something I can do without training.</p>
        <p>At 6, Alonzo, my work partner, arrives. He tells me he usually spends between two and three hours loading in the huge freezer warehouse, where the temperature is about 20 degrees below. ''Don't be no fool,'' he says. ''If you start to get cold, come outta there.'' He puts on his outfit, which includes a sweatshirt and a ski mask. Suddenly feeling tremendously underdressed, I acknowledge that I'm no Iron Man and follow him into the freezer. Clouds of steam billow into the dock -- immediately, the 40 degrees of the loading dock seems warm and autumnal. He rolls in on a small electric forklift and I pull on my gloves and the hood and step into the room, which looks to be the size of the warehouse in the very last scene of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' where the lost ark of the covenant is secreted away. Except there's ice cream as far as the eye can see: half-gallons of every flavor, bundled in rock-hard blocks about six feet tall, in which the half-gallons are arranged in individually plastic-wrapped bundles of four; three-gallon parlor tubs stacked neatly; and boxes and boxes of ice cream bars and treats. They all sit atop little wooden platforms -- they're about 4 feet by 4 feet and called pallets -- that can be picked up with the forklifts without touching the ice cream. My job is to move all the loose half-gallons to one side, and pull the empty pallets into the aisle. Alonzo can then drive through and pick up all the empty pallets, which he can stack in a pile so that they're ready for reusing. The half-gallons can be tricky to pick up (they're slightly slippery, between the plastic wrap and the coated gloves), and you don't want to drop them, since the damaged ones can't be sold.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Alonzo comes by to tell me it's time to break, and we exit the freezer facility. I think he looks funny until we step onto the docks and my glasses instantly fog up and are coated with a layer of ice. As I go into the bathroom to clean them, I glance into the mirror and am horrified. My hair has gone completely white. When I put my cleaned glasses back on, I realize my dreadlocks are covered with frost, as are my eyelashes and mustache. A sheath of ice falls from my hair into the sink, and I pull little pieces of ice out of my facial hair. Cool. I also notice that I've broken a sweat.</p>
        <p>Back at the hotel, I dial up my father and can still smell the butter pecan syrup on my hands from the day before. He's amused by my little adventure. ''I know I don't have to tell you I worked those jobs so you didn't have to,'' he laughs. He sounds happy and mentions that he's wearing one of the Swatches I bought him, one of the few watches that would have remained more valuable had he left it in the case. I go to put on my watch and reach into my pocket to find shards and gears. It was crushed during the shift. ''Sounds like a good way to remember what your day was like,'' he chuckles. I place the remains of the Heuer -- which looks as if it were hit by a comet -- and put on the Bulova. I realize I would be heartbroken if I'd damaged it. There's a silence on the other end of the phone -- my dad feels something, too -- and we say our goodbyes. I'm a little overcome, having put myself in his shoes. It was important to him that I lead my own life, and tasting of a bit of his had made my own make a lot more sense to me.</p>
