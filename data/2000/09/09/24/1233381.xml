        <p>The court clerk choked up as he recalled his agony of conscience. One justice called the last six months a nightmare. Another said the court was made up of five prima donnas. And today, a former justice who resigned amid scandal discussed the humiliation of his publicly torturous divorce.</p>
        <p>These are humbling days for the highest court in New Hampshire, as the impeachment trial of the court's chief justice puts it on display on live public television, its justices stripped of their robes, baring their feelings and foibles for all the state to see.</p>
        <p>''This isn't just about words, it's about human beings, and the ambiguity that comes with everyone just trying to make their way through life, and trying to remember what did they say, and what did they do, and why did they do it?'' said Albert E. Scherr, associate dean of the Franklin Pierce Law Center here. ''It's almost operatic in the story lines that are playing out here.''</p>
        <p>Drama aside, legal authorities like Dean Scherr say the trial, which has lasted a week and is expected to continue at least another week, also carries broad legal and political significance. In particular, it highlights the tension in many states, some say, between the need to keep the courts safely removed from political meddling and the need to keep a strong check on a court's power when it steps out of line.</p>
        <p>Where this trial fits in that picture is open to interpretation: some New Hampshire observers see the Legislature's impeachment of Chief Justice David Brock as payback for politically unpopular decisions the Supreme Court has made, particularly one that revamped the state's system for paying for schools. Others see the trial as a necessary housecleaning by lawmakers of a judicial system that got too chummy with old-boy connections and too sloppy with ethical practices.</p>
        <p>What is undisputable is that the trial is lifting the curtain behind which the court operates, revealing it in all its complex dynamics, including the isolation some justices say they feel in their legal seclusion where the phone rarely rings, the feeling of family they develop together and the tensions that arise around disputes over law and proper behavior.</p>
        <p>When Justice John T. Broderick Jr. decided that he had to report a colleague in an ethical violation, ''It was like a death in the family, that's what it felt like,'' he said this week.</p>
        <p>It was that ethical violation that ultimately led to the current trial: Justice W. Stephen Thayer III, who has since resigned and been given immunity in the case by prosecutors, was in the middle of a divorce. His wife, Judith, former chairwoman of the state board of education, was appealing a decision in the case. Justice Thayer's colleagues all recused themselves from hearing it. So other judges were needed to serve on a special panel for the Thayer divorce.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 4, according to a report by the state attorney general and recent testimony, Justice Thayer explosively objected to the choice of a particular judge for that panel. In response, Chief Justice Brock tried to prevent the court clerk, Howard Zibel, from calling that judge but was too late.</p>
        <p>It had been known for months that Mr. Zibel had acted as a critical whistleblower by reporting the incident in a memo to a judicial watchdog panel; what had not been quite  clear until he testified this week was just how badly Mr. Zibel had agonized before doing so.</p>
        <p>He kept thinking, Mr. Zibel said, about a colleague's recent talk describing how court clerks had handled the transport orders for the Jewish children of Vichy France in World War II; he had lost his great-grandparents in the Holocaust, he said, and while he was not equating the ethical dilemma of the Vichy court clerks to his own, still, ''I think all of that has a bearing on why I couldn't sleep that night,'' he testified.</p>
        <p>The bottom line, he said, was that ''my obligation was to report unprofessional conduct, and this crossed a line I couldn't abide.''</p>
        <p>Justice Broderick, who also reported Justice Thayer, described sleeplessness of his own, and agonizing through ''a week I would not want to relive.''</p>
        <p>''I knew the choice I would make, and the court would make, would be to ultimately end a person's professional life at age 54,'' he said, referring to Justice Thayer. ''I would pass that cross to anyone in this room. I didn't want it. He was my friend. He was my colleague.''</p>
        <p>Overall, Chief Justice Brock, 64, stands accused on four articles of impeachment: of making a phone call to a Superior Court judge 13 years ago seeking to influence a case; of allowing Justice Thayer to influence the appointment of judges in his own case; of allowing judges to comment on cases from which they had recused themselves, and of repeatedly lying under oath. He denies lying or seeking undue influence, and says that while he has made mistakes, nothing rises to the level of an impeachable crime. The court's recusal policy has been overhauled since the case began, as has the state's procedure for appointing justices.</p>
        <p>Justice Thayer and other justices also testified that though they sometimes commented on cases that they had recused themselves from, they never saw a justice try to change the outcome of a case in his own interest.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Brock is expected to take the stand in his defense, and has been attending every day, a snowy-haired, ruddy-faced figure accompanied by his wife and sometimes some of their six children. Several colleagues have said that one of Chief Justice Brock's daughters had been found to have cancer just before the Thayer incident, and he could well have been distracted and under unusual stress.</p>
        <p>Every justice to speak has praised Chief Justice Brock; Justice Sherman Horton said that though ''the court consists of five prima donnas and they've all got their own ideas,'' Chief Justice Brock ''does an excellent job of moving the ball forward with five prima donnas, and I don't think I could do it.''</p>
        <p>The outcome of the trial is no easy call, legal observers say. Though some New Hampshire state representatives who backed impeachment said they expected that their charges would not withstand the Senate trial, no one is confidently predicting the verdict. The 22 senators who are hearing the case are keeping their views to themselves, though some do sometimes betray a slight predilection toward speeding the trial, which is inconveniently scheduled just as campaigns are heating up.</p>
        <p>Justice Broderick may have offered the saddest assessment of the situation: ''There are no winners here. I feel badly for Justice Thayer, for the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, for the time, effort and money that's gone into this whole process.''</p>
