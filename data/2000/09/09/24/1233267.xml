        <p>It's a tough job but somebody's got. . . .</p>
        <p>Actually, nobody really has to do it. But in the service economy that thrives in New York, more flat tire repair shops are able to survive than one might guess. Several businesses that will fix a flat tire for $5 to $10 are situated along a strip of west Midtown occupied by gas stations, parking lots and turn-of-the-century tenements.</p>
        <p>One of these businesses, Frank's Tires, occupies the ground floor of a three-story, red-brick apartment building at 449 10th Avenue. The shop is situated between 10th Avenue Taxi Parts and 35th Street. If no customers have pulled up, a passer-by might see Juan Flores, Mario Lael and other employees sitting in  grease-stained office chairs, chatting and watching the traffic head uptown.</p>
        <p>On a recent afternoon, Brian Ramos, a Flushing resident who works at Chelsea Piers, pulled up in his '91 Honda Accord with a flat right rear tire.</p>
        <p>''I was going down 23rd Street,'' he said, ''and some guy in a truck was like, 'Yo, you got a flat.' I knew there were a lot of these places on 10th Avenue.''</p>
        <p>Most of the cars that use the service --  about 85 percent according to the shop's owner, Frank Im -- are taxis, which he said take much more abuse and are much more likely to get a flat than private cars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Im charges taxis $5 to fix a flat, which usually takes 5 to 10 minutes. Private cars, which return less often, are charged $10.</p>
        <p>Mr. Im, 24, a recent graduate of the State University of New York at Albany, inherited the store from his father, George, who owned it for more than 25 years.</p>
        <p>''I used to come here when I was 7 or 8 years old,'' the younger Mr. Im said. ''Back then, we used to see crack heads, drug dealers, prostitutes, syringes on the floor. But ever since they built the Javits  Center, everything has just gotten better.''</p>
        <p>On a Monday morning, a driver for the Concord Limousine Company of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, pulled up in a shiny black Lincoln Town Car.</p>
        <p>''Slow leak,'' he said, as Mr. Lael, 20,  who lives on Northern Boulevard in Queens, stepped out to see what needed to be done.</p>
        <p>Just then, another driver with the same company pulled up behind him.</p>
        <p>''What's up, 300,'' said the driver, who would identify himself only as Alex.</p>
        <p>''The new car got a flat tire,'' said the driver of car No. 300, Hany Elshafei. ''What's wrong with you?''</p>
        <p>''A new car can't get a flat tire?'' Alex asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Elshafei had been driving on his spare that morning, after discovering a flat at Newark Airport the night before.</p>
        <p>''Last night I'm taking a customer to Metuchen, 1 o'clock in the morning,'' he said. ''When I come back. . . .'' his voice trailed off, no need to state the obvious.</p>
