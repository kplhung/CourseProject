        <p>Bodies In Motion And At Rest</p>
        <p>Essays.</p>
        <p>By Thomas Lynch.</p>
        <p>Norton, $23.95.</p>
        <p>Thomas Lynch's ''daily witness of mortality,'' during his nearly three decades as a funeral director, has not only been what he calls a bracing ''balm'' against melancholia and self-pity, but also a muse, inspiring three books of poetry and a collection of essays, ''The Undertaking.'' The essays in ''Bodies in Motion and at Rest'' are a thought-provoking, engaging hybrid of memoir, meditation and comic monologue.+Whether writing about his Roman Catholic boyhood, fatherhood, the family legacy of alcoholism, the funeral trade or the integral relationship in his life between the ''mortuary and literary arts,'' Lynch approaches his subjects with a beautifully executed balance of+irreverence with reverence, gallows humor with emotional delicacy and no-nonsense immanence with lyrical transcendence. Nowhere is that more evident than in the title essay on the death of George Horton, the cemetery sexton. As Lynch consoled Horton's daughter, he took comfort in his memory of what the ever practical-minded Horton once said while filling a grave: ''You gonna make babies, you've gotta make some room. . . . Copulation, population, inspiration, expiration.'' Lynch also has another go at his bte noire, Jessica Mitford and her fixation on funeral costs and disregard of the meaning and solace funerals provide for the living. Recollecting his initiation into the family business, Lynch relates how his father described the line of coffins he carried in terms like ''warmth and beauty.'' These were not simply selling points, as a Mitford would see it, but qualities that the bereaved sought to have their loved ones surrounded with in death as in life.+The facts of death, like the facts of life,'' Lynch writes, ''are required learning.''</p>
