        <p>Angolan Oil Offers Hope  Next year Angola hopes to pump a million barrels of oil daily off its coast, and the government is taking tentative steps to redirect its vast oil revenues toward rebuilding the shattered country. The government has promised to increase health and education spending and to allow independent auditors to scrutinize its figures on oil profits, which have not previously been fully disclosed.</p>

        <p>Yugoslavia's Vote and Beyond  The people of Yugoslavia will vote on Sunday in what everyone agrees is a watershed election for the future of President Slobodan Milosevic, who trails his main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, in the opinion polls. But no one knows how Mr. Milosevic and his government will react to the vote, or how the people of Serbia will respond.</p>

        <p>Peru's Complex Power Reality  President Alberto K. Fujimori has promised to dismantle the powerful National Intelligence Service, prompted by the broadcast of a video late last week that shows his security adviser apparently offering a bribe. But experts say that even if he means what he says, a complete purge may be extremely difficult.</p>

        <p>A Political Career Built at the Ballpark  As an owner of the Texas Rangers, Gov. George W. Bush helped improve the team and build a new ballpark. He also acquired wealth and a resume he would need to succeed in politics.</p>

        <p>Mr. Bush is now spending an unexpected amount of time and money campaigning in Florida. And Republicans have begun to second-guess the Bush campaign, saying it took the state for granted and failed to see signs of Vice President Al Gore's potential to win.</p>

        <p>Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, is struggling in the polls, but he has been attracting huge and adoring crowds on the campaign trail.</p>

        <p>States Forfeiting Aid  Forty states will soon lose hundreds of millions of dollars of federal money that was supposed to provide health insurance to children in low-income families, officials say.</p>

        <p>More Steps on Oil Prices  The administration took several more steps to cushion the oil market against shortages and to soften the shock of higher prices on consumers. In addition, President Clinton called for $400 million in aid to help poor families buy fuel.</p>

        <p>Hollywood Facing the Senate  Hollywood studios are in the throes of deciding how to defend themselves in hearings on the marketing of R-rated entertainment to children.</p>

        <p>Mrs. Clinton and Lazio Reach Tentative Deal on Soft Money  Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio reached a tentative agreement to forgo the use of millions of dollars in soft money for advertising in the New York Senate race, but the deal included several conditions and provisions that could derail it and came just a day after talks on a similar proposal collapsed. Both sides would place a ban on television and radio advertisements paid for by political parties with so-called soft money.</p>

        <p>Migrants Find Suburbs Hostile  When two Hispanic immigrants seeking work were lured to an abandoned building in Farmingville, N.Y., and attacked by two white men wielding a knife, a crowbar and a shovel, the assault was a sobering reminder of the lives of the unwanted strangers. Emotions are raw, it is estimated that in the summertime, one in 15 residents is a migrant worker.</p>
