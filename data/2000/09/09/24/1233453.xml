        <p>They are still passionate about bird-watching. Three have traveled together to South America. The other remains a fixture in Central Park, hoisting his binoculars and jotting down observations.</p>
        <p>But one place that these four bird-watchers won't be visiting anytime soon is Colombia.</p>
        <p>In March 1998, Peter Shen and Thomas Fiore, of New York City; Todd R. Mark, of Houston; and Louise Augustine, of Chillicothe, Ill., were kidnapped by Colombian guerrillas during a birding trip to a mountainous region 35 miles south of Bogota. The guerrillas, members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's largest and most powerful rebel group, said they would kill the captives if they tried to escape.</p>
        <p>On April 2, Mr. Fiore, above, did escape, marching through rugged terrain for six hours before being discovered by a television crew. Three weeks later, the others were released, unharmed.</p>
        <p>Upon their return to America, the four had difficulty, at first, talking about their ordeal, which included forced marches in difficult mountain terrain during the day and handcuffs at night. Gradually, though, they bounced back, said Mr. Mark, a flight attendant. In fact, several months after the abduction, Mr. Shen, Mr. Mark and Ms. Augustine traveled to Peru and Chile to -- what else? -- go bird-watching.</p>
        <p>These days, Mr. Fiore, a bicycle repairman, spends much of his time in Central Park. Ms. Augustine, a retired teacher, still travels frequently on bird-watching trips. Mr. Shen, a former cell biologist at New York University, is now a law student and a new father, Mr. Mark said.</p>
        <p>''We had some close scrapes,'' said Mr. Mark, who still harbors a deep hatred toward the rebel group. ''We weren't treated well; two people were almost killed. So when you go through a danger like that, and everyone comes out O.K., I think we're all just relieved to be released.''</p>
