        <p>MICHELE HERNANDEZ sent a shock wave through college admissions offices across the country a few months ago when she announced her top price for advising a high school student through the college admission process: $28,000.</p>

        <p>MICHELE HERNANDEZ sent a shock wave through college admissions offices across the country a few months ago when she announced her top price for advising a high school student through the college admission process: $28,000.</p>
        <p>''It did raise some eyebrows about what was appropriate pricing,'' said Joyce Smith, executive director of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, which includes private counselors as well as high school-based counselors and college admissions officers. Most counselors charge less than $4,000 to see a student through the process, though they also often charge $100 an hour for shorter consultations.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hernandez, who grew up in Armonk and is now based in Florida, put it more bluntly: ''I got hate mail from other counselors.'' She said she knew of at least one counselor whose prices are higher than hers. Also, the $28,000 package includes unlimited time with the student throughout high school. For short-term help on completing applications she charges $4,500. Nonetheless, she soon took most of the prices off her Web site, www.AisforAdmission.com.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Hernandez is not worried about her clients' ability to pay. One of the areas she coaches her students in, she said, is ''If you want to downplay your wealth, how do you portray what your parents do.'' For example, she said, ''If your dad is the head of Bear, Stearns, you can just write 'banker.' ''</p>
        <p>Unlike most counselors, Ms. Hernandez deals exclusively with Ivy-bound clients. She was assistant director of admissions at Dartmouth College from 1992 to 1997 and used that experience to write a book, ''A is for Admission,'' that angered her former colleagues and stirred controversy by revealing the details of Dartmouth's admission process.</p>
        <p>She is not shy about her own merits. ''In general, I am against private counselors,'' she said. ''Except for teaching my book, I don't think they have much to offer.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hernandez's Web site offers a taste of her approach: ''You probably have heard horror stories from neighbors and friends about students with perfect 1600 SAT scores or valedictorians who get rejected from top schools. Unfortunately, many of these stories are true, but if those applicants had only done a better job of presenting themselves, they might have been accepted. What can an applicant do to increase his or her chances for admission? In short, you need to work with an insider.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hernandez's goal, she said, is ''to make you look the way you would look on the best day of your life.''</p>
        <p>She does a number of things other counselors do, like advising students about which courses and exams to take, and arranging SAT tutoring. She will help them come up with topics for their application essays, even help outline the essay and revise it with them as many times as necessary.</p>
        <p>She will also encourage students to focus their interests, and find ways to make them seem more alluring to admissions officers. She urged one student with an interest in science to take more science classes, and ultimately had her call a professor at one of her target schools to discuss the research she had done.</p>
        <p>''Ironically, you want to look unpackaged and raw,'' Ms. Hernandez said. ''Someone like me can be behind the scenes and make someone look raw without over-packaging them.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hernandez started doing private counseling full time only this year, and has had a total of 15 clients, she said. She cannot guarantee that her clients will get into an Ivy League school, and she will turn away students whom she thinks she cannot help. But she said she has ''almost 99 percent accuracy'' at predicting where they will get in.</p>
