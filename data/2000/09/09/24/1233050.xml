        <p>IT was the last stop on my tour of Finnish sauna culture, but nothing quite prepared me for the King's Road smoke sauna just outside of Helsinki.</p>
        <p>On a trip in May, I had already visited Helsinki's elite Finnish Sauna Society, a bastion of purist practices. I had plunged into the icy waters of a river near the Arctic Circle. I had even been to corporate Helsinki's equivalent of lunch at the Palm: the power sauna atop the Palace Hotel.</p>
        <p>But now I stood naked in a dilapidated and soot-covered wooden shack in Espoo, a Helsinki suburb.</p>
        <p>To the left was a wood-burning oven: a pile of rocks five feet high and six feet in diameter at the base. In front was a rickety wooden ladder up to the loft. Up in the rafters, about half a dozen men sweated as they sat in almost pitch-black darkness.</p>
        <p>As I climbed up, the temperature rose sharply and the heat bore into my skin. Someone tossed water over the rocks, creating an intense blast of steam that Finns lovingly call the loyly (pronounced somewhat like LOH-loo).</p>
        <p>''Once you have been in a smoke sauna,'' said Matti Kivinen, a burly and bearded veteran of saunas who accompanied me, ''you will never want to go back to an electric one.''</p>
        <p>I had my doubts. But an hour and a half later, I was feeling good enough to believe anything. I had endured three sessions in the rafters, and doused myself in icy water after each.</p>
        <p>Between sessions, I cooled off outside, where men cooked sausages on an open grill. Steam rose off our skin in the chilly evening breeze but we couldn't feel the cold.</p>
        <p>I felt electric, euphoric and yet utterly relaxed.</p>
        <p>''People in other countries often talk about all kinds of health benefits from the sauna,'' said Dr. Lasse Viinikka, a surgeon and board member of the Finnish Sauna Society who had come by that particular evening.</p>
        <p>''The truth is, there have been all kinds of studies and there aren't really any health effects. It just makes you feel good.''</p>
        <p>That was perhaps the key lesson of Finnish sauna culture: it just makes you feel good. At least to Finns, the sauna is a pleasure that is hedonistic yet spiritual. It is also a revered refuge from stress that can be a family activity, a social event and sometimes even a religious experience.</p>
        <p>This year, Helsinki is highlighting 12 of the area's most distinctive saunas, each a ''sauna of the month.'' They range from cavernous public spas to tiny private hideaways, and they were chosen to display saunas as a Finnish social institution.</p>
        <p>True, it is a publicity gimmick. But the program offers foreign visitors a unique chance to experience a remarkable diversity of saunas as well as the many ways that Finns take them.</p>
        <p>One purpose of my sauna tour was to have a window on Finnish culture. The other was to see how the people who largely invented sauna culture actually do it themselves.</p>
        <p>''Sauna'' is one of the very few Finnish words that has made its way into English and most other Western languages. But to hear Finns talk, American saunas and sauna habits are as tepid and hurried as instant decaffeinated coffee.</p>
        <p>Finns do not claim to have invented the sauna; the Russians, the Mayas and the Aztecs all developed fairly similar practices. Nevertheless, it is hard to find a country more obsessed with them.</p>
        <p>Finland is a country of five million people and two million saunas -- most of them in private homes. Taking a sauna there is a two-hour event, a ritual that is often stretched out with swimming, socializing, eating and even drinking light beer.</p>
        <p>It is a place where families routinely take saunas together and where the average baby's first visit is at about five months.</p>
        <p>Once upon a time, Finns viewed saunas almost as holy places. They were used as birthing rooms as well as places to clean the bodies of those who had just died. Even today, the Rekola Lutheran Church in Helsinki opens its sauna on selected days in December, its purpose to wash away the sorrows of the past year.</p>
        <p>Finns are also quick to say there are few absolute rules.</p>
        <p>Some people drink light beer during their cool-downs; others abhor alcohol.</p>
        <p>Some people roll in snow and go ice swimming; others take cool showers.</p>
        <p>Community saunas rigorously separate men from women, but families and close-knit groups routinely abandon such discretion in private.</p>
        <p>What almost every Finn agrees on is that saunas are an indispensable part of life. Many also have an insatiable curiosity to see the variations other Finns have come up with.</p>
        <p>Indeed, that was why at least three board members of the Finnish Sauna Society trekked out to Kings Road Sauna (Kuninkaantien Savusauna in Finnish) on the evening I tried it out early in May. The sauna, which may be the oldest one in the country still in use, was normally closed to nonmembers but had been opened to the public as that month's highlighted sauna.</p>
        <p>Foreign tourists actually have better access to a variety of different saunas in Helsinki than Finns. Foreigners can make arrangements to visit most of the highlighted saunas regardless of the month, and some will be accessible even next year. And there are other saunas, not on the official list, that are also worth a visit.</p>
        <p>Prices vary from about $5 at the King's Road to nearly $100 for a private sauna at the Palace Hotel.</p>
        <p>PLANNING is important. Many saunas are open only on certain days, and a few need to be reserved several weeks in advance.  Visitors also have to reckon with gender-separation. Most community saunas  require that men and women come on separate days, which means that traveling partners may have to plot separate itineraries.</p>
        <p>Americans may be startled by the absence of warnings about potential health risks. There are no signs about length of a  session, the maximum permissible temperature, or checking with a physician if you are pregnant or have had heart trouble.</p>
        <p>The range of sauna styles is wide. King's Road Sauna, built in 1839, is an example of the most traditional: a wood-burning, chimneyless smoke type.</p>
        <p>Fires are kindled in an oven inside a pile of rocks, hours before anyone enters the sauna. During this heating-up period, smoke fills the room -- hence the soot on the walls -- and gradually escapes through a hole in the roof. Once the fire dies out and the smoke escapes, the rocks radiate heat for up to six hours and the smoke leaves a soft and aromatic residue that permeates the steam.</p>
        <p>To many Finnish devotees, this is the pinnacle of sauna experience because the steam is somehow softer and richer.</p>
        <p>A second category, not quite so old, have wood-burning ovens but channel the smoke out through a chimney and leave the cedar cabin soot-free. These are considered the next best option. The most common are electric, similar to those in the United States but usually a good deal hotter -- 194 degrees Fahrenheit and higher is common.</p>
        <p>The real diversity is in the social accouterments. At the Palace Hotel, people cool down while overlooking Helsinki's downtown harbor and have waiters at their beck and call. The Yrjonkatu public spa, built in 1928 and recently restored, offers a magnificent indoor pool with saunas and steam baths. At the Villa Hvittrask, which is not on the official list, people can rent a lakeside sauna and hold their own sauna party.</p>
        <p>My first encounter with a Finnish saunas was in Oulu, a small town so close to the Arctic Circle that it gets two months of uninterrupted daylight and two months of uninterrupted darkness.</p>
        <p>It was early May, and the sky was still light until almost midnight. Our hosts, Seppo and Anna-Maija Maki, took us to a municipal sauna in a forest retreat alongside the Oulu River. Seppo, a stocky and exuberant city official in his early 60's, startled us by serving beer and finger food as soon as we arrived.</p>
        <p>This struck me as bizarre if not dangerous, even if the beer did have a very low alcoholic content. But Seppo looked no worse for the wear, so we both sipped while our wives took the first sauna sessions.</p>
        <p>Until Oulu, I had vowed never to follow a Finn into ice-cold water between saunas. Cold showers, maybe. A river that had been frozen solid three weeks earlier? No way.</p>
        <p>Many Finns feel the same way. Seppo's wife, Anna-Maija, wouldn't go near the river. But when Seppo himself ran buck naked down to the pier and jumped in, I followed.</p>
        <p>For a moment, the icy water was partly neutralized by the heat in my body.</p>
        <p>But after diving underwater for about five seconds, I resurfaced in a sputtering and frenzied rush back to the pier.</p>
        <p>Still, there was no question about it: the hot-cold switch created an intense exhilaration and euphoria. Seppo and I drank another beer and went back to the sauna for a second round.</p>
        <p>If Helsinki has a bastion of sauna purism, it is probably the exclusive Finnish Sauna Society on Lauttasaari Island. Situated about 15 minutes' drive from downtown, the society is nestled among birch trees on a peninsula jutting into the Gulf of Finland.</p>
        <p>Membership is not particularly expensive -- less than $200 a year -- but being accepted is as difficult as joining an exclusive country club. The society prides itself on being a quasi-official arbiter of true sauna culture.</p>
        <p>The saunas themselves are lovingly maintained. Two are the chimneyless smoke type, two are conventional wood-burners and one is a state-of-the-art electric model.</p>
        <p>The society also offers vihta, the famous birch branches that Finns use to whip themselves (the act of vihtominen) during the sauna. The practice sounds masochistic, and the sound itself is intimidating, but the main effect is to make your skin tingle. Many Finns claim the whippings are nearly magical.</p>
        <p>What makes the Society special is its setting. People can cool down on a porch looking out on the water, or walk down to the wooden jetty and jump right in. Inside are lounges for relaxing and socializing. Ice swimming in the winter is a standard option, and many members partake.</p>
        <p>It isn't hard to get an earful about etiquette and philosophy in Espoo. Society officials bristle at foreigners who fuss that saunas are dangerous if they reach 194 degrees. They are also quick to dispute claims that saunas can cure many ailments. ''We do not make any health claims about saunas,'' Sirkka Korvo, the executive secretary, said. ''The sauna is a place for relaxation.''</p>
        <p>In contrast to the Society's rural feeling, the Yrjonkatu is strictly urban. It looks a bit like a mosque with a sparkling pool in a cavernous central hall. The water is warm, rather than frigid, and swimming is only in the nude.</p>
        <p>To use its three saunas, two wood-heated, and classic steam room for two hours costs about $9, at 6.83 marks to the dollar, for adults; a private, relaxing cabana overlooks the pool.</p>
        <p>Men and women are admitted on separate days, but waitresses patrol the cabanas regardless of whose day it is -- and they keep their clothes on.</p>
        <p>Helsinki's power sauna, the place corporate executives often reserve to cultivate business ties and cut deals, is on the top floor of the Palace Hotel. Reserving a six-person sauna, as well as the fabulous relaxing area that overlooks the harbor, costs $51 plus $11.50 per person on a weekday. Weekends cost $21.50 more. Yet despite its luxury, the Palace Hotel sauna is not a particularly unusual experience.</p>
        <p>Another option is a late-night summer sauna party at Villa Hvittrask, a hilltop villa about 30 minutes' drive west of Helsinki. It was built and designed in 1903 by three of Finland's most prominent architects -- Herman Gesellius, Armas Lindgren and Eliel Saarinen -- who also built homes for themselves there.</p>
        <p>Today, the villa is a museum and restaurant, and the sauna house is reached by a long footpath down to the lake.</p>
        <p>The house offers just about everything for a good sauna party: a wood-fired sauna; changing rooms stocked with towels, robes and toiletries; a dining room that seats 12; a small kitchen area; and a front porch overlooking a lake. Though hikers do occasionally stroll by, it is secluded enough that guests can make their way to the water without having to squirm into a bathing suit first.</p>
        <p>Visiting Helsinki's full dozen highlighted saunas is probably too much, but trying just one or two is enough to savor the experience and understand some of the contrasts in sauna style.</p>
        <p>As the Finns say, the point of a sauna is that it makes you feel good. Almost any of them will accomplish that.</p>
        <p>Going to extremes, hot and cold</p>
        <p>Discount Card</p>
        <p>Visitors intent on sampling Finnish saunas may benefit by first buying a Helsinki Card, which offers discounts on touring and transportation. It costs $19, at 6.83 marks to dollar, and is available at hotels and the Helsinki Tourist Office, but not in the United States.</p>
