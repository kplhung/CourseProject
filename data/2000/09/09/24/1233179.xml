        <p>FOR Evan Dunn, the morning commute is a pain. ''I wake up earlier and earlier to get a parking spot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That may sound familiar to commuters on the county's rail lines, but Evan Dunn is a Rye High School senior. ''I get to high school at 7:20,'' he said, even though the first bell doesn't ring until 7:50. ''It's hard.''</p>
        <p>As enrollments surge, incomes increase and many parents think little of buying their child a car, parking has become a problem at many high schools.</p>
        <p>''We really have run out of space for our staff,'' said Michael Yazurlo, the Tuckahoe schools superintendent. ''We've asked the students to park on the street.''</p>
        <p>What compounds the problem, even in districts that offer busing, is that many students shun the buses or find them impractical, given their extracurricular and work schedules. In Chappaqua, few self-respecting high school students will ride the bus, derided as the ''loser cruiser,'' preferring to get rides from parents or other students.</p>
        <p>''It's a symbolic issue for students, it's like a birthright,'' said Dr. James Rooney, the principal of Rye High School, which does not offer busing. ''You have a car; you want to drive. No one knows what to do with the problem. Parking is part of a larger problem of congestion. We're so squeezed for space we don't have enough space for athletic fields.''</p>
        <p>In Ardsley, for the first time, high school seniors who wanted to park on campus had to take part in a lottery the day before classes began to obtain a space.</p>
        <p>With construction under way at the Ardsley High campus, parking is at a premium. ''Eighty-nine students applied for parking,'' said the Student Council vice president, Daniel Scheer. ''Thirty-two got guaranteed spots, the rest got temporary spots and 13 got nothing. We were the first junior class not to have parking, and now we're the first senior class not to have parking. People are upset if they didn't get a spot.''</p>
        <p>The situation is not much better in Yorktown, which offers busing.</p>
        <p>''We provide 200 spaces for teachers, students and visitors. The problem is that we're about 150 spaces short,'' said Dr. Robert Van Zanten, the school superintendent. ''We feel terrible there is a problem and are looking for a solution.''</p>
        <p>Michael Zani, a Yorktown high school senior and president of the Student Senate there, said: ''School starts at 7:30, and kids are showing up an hour early. When it comes down to it, the board feels that students don't need to be parking here. The majority of students use their cars to stay for after-school help or an after-school job.''</p>
        <p>Parking pressures on campus frequently spill over to the community. In Greenburgh, neighborhood concerns about student parking on narrow side streets led to parking  restrictions last September on some of the blocks near Ardsley High School during morning school hours.</p>
        <p>''About a year ago, the neighborhood association around the high school asked us to limit parking,'' the Greenburgh town supervisor, Paul J. Feiner, said. ''People who live there were complaining about the kids parking and other related problems, like loitering, noise and garbage. For some people, it was just too much. It's a quality-of-life issue. We complied with their requests. If the high school built more parking, then we could do  away with the parking rules.''</p>
        <p>Similar complaints are heard in other communities. In Rye, the Board of Education and the city of Rye recently agreed to undertake a traffic study to see how to solve the parking dilemma and the safety issues it raised. In Yorktown, students and administrators have been debating ways to increase parking spaces for students, and this month Yorktown banned parking during school hours on some of the residential streets near the high school.</p>
        <p>When students have to park on nearby streets, sometimes they run the risk of being ticketed by the police. The church across the street from Rye High School has put a chain across its parking lot and has posted signs forbidding parking during school hours.</p>
        <p>The issue is a complicated one. On the one hand, there are the adults -- whether high school faculty seeking parking at their jobs,  administrators concerned about student safety or neighbors who want to reclaim their streets -- and on the other, teenagers eager to exercise their newly won mobility, and even some of their parents who are happy to be liberated from chauffeur duty.</p>
        <p>As Dr. Van Zanten said, ''The Board of Education fears opening up more campus spaces to parking because they're fearful that if we do add spaces, more kids will drive, exacerbating the problem instead of solving it.''</p>
        <p>However sympathetic some adults may be to the students' plight, a reserved parking spot is still seen as an adult entitlement, not a teenager's. As Ed DiNunzio, head of security at Rye High School, said: ''I feel bad for them because they have no place to park. Some teachers are sympathetic -- but don't park in their space.''</p>
        <p>Then again, there are districts like Hastings-on-Hudson, where there is no student  parking at all.</p>
        <p>''Because of increasing enrollment, which meant increasing staff, we decided not to have parking for students,'' Dr. John J. Russell, schools superintendent in Hastings, said. ''We're now reserving a significant number of spaces for our faculty. The students weren't happy, but they understand.  Our school district is two square miles. There's no compelling reason for students to have a car here.''</p>
        <p>And then there are those who can't be bothered to deal with cars at school.</p>
        <p>''I walk to school,'' said Mike Laidlaw, a senior at Rye High School. ''Sometimes I get rides to school from people who've had to park their cars near my house. I have a car, but I usually walk.''</p>
