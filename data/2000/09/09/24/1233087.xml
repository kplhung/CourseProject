        <p>Hilton has opened its fourth hotel in China, what will be a 372-room establishment in Dalian, the major northeastern port city 300 miles east of Beijing on Korea Bay. The 36-story hotel is in the Chang Jiang Commercial Complex, which includes an apartment building and an office tower, on the harbor.</p>
        <p>The hotel, which opened in August, had 252 rooms available early this month, with the others scheduled to be ready by the end of October, a Hilton spokeswoman said. Public areas include a pyramid-shaped crystal fountain separating an indoor garden from the lobby, and displays of contemporary Chinese art.</p>
