      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>While not all fortunes are the result of thrift and industry, a lack of these two virtues most surely destroys them (The Way We Live Now: Nelson W. Aldrich Jr., Sept. 3). If it is equality of opportunity that Aldrich desires, he need look no further than his family's fortune, which was diminished by human nature rather than by the strong arm of the government. If he believes that it would be better for the American public to inherit every fortune, he lacks both understanding and a sense of humor. For while the American public's voracious appetite for unearned goods and services could make quick work of the largest of fortunes, the result is far less entertaining than hearing that a lady blew it all for a Hungarian count or that a man was disowned by his own mother.</p>
