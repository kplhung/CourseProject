        <p>They are stories of the heart, unscripted Olympic moments of poignancy, tenderness and sportsmanship that live for the ages.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the dead heat between two American teammates, Gary Hall Jr. and Anthony Ervin, who trained together, ate together, reached the finish of the men's 50-meter freestyle in the same time and stood on the same victory platform for the national anthem provided another thread in this rich Olympic tapestry.</p>
        <p>The fact that Hall is white and Ervin is the first swimmer of African-American descent to win a gold medal is almost incidental to their friendship and their ability to overcome two of the premier names in swimming, Aleksandr Popov of Russia and Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands. Hall already had his place in another memorable moment in Olympic history. For amazingly, it was Hall who had been carried around the pool to the medal stand by his father during the 1976 Montreal Olympics.</p>
        <p>The Olympics have provided the backdrop for any number of these stories that touch the heart.</p>
        <p>At another Australian Olympics, 1956 in Melbourne, an American hammer thrower, Harold Connolly, and a Czech discus thrower, Olga Fikotova, overcame the chill of the Cold War in the Olympic Village, won separate gold medals and then carried their international romance to Prague, where 40,000 well-wishers attended their wedding ceremony.</p>
        <p>In 1968, Vera Caslavska, a Czech gymnast, survived the Soviet invasion of her homeland earlier in the year and won four gold medals and two silvers, including the all-around title, in Mexico City. During the medal ceremony for the floor exercise, where Caslavska shared first place with Larisa Petrick of the Soviet Union, when the Soviet national anthem was being played, in a silent moment of protest, Caslavska bowed her head and turned away.</p>
        <p>Twenty-four hours later, with the Games still on, Caslavska was married in a civil ceremony at the house of the Czechoslovak ambassador and then serenaded by a crowd of 10,000 as she and Josef Odlozil, a runner, were married at a Roman Catholic church in Xocalo Square.</p>
        <p>Dick Landon, the 1920 Olympic high jump champion, met his future wife Alice, a diver, shipboard en route to Antwerp, Belgium. At Helsinki, Finland, in 1952, it was a husband-wife gold medal double when Emil Zatopek of Czechoslovakia won the men's 5,000 meters. After joyfully inspecting her husband's gold medal, Dana Zatopkova followed by setting an Olympic record in the javelin.</p>
        <p>The saga of Derek Redmond was embraced by millions of television viewers. The British 400-meter runner was assisted to the finish of a semifinal heat in Barcelona, Spain, by his father, Jim, after tearing a hamstring during the 1992 Olympic race.</p>
        <p>Less obvious, but equally touching, was a medal ceremony in shooting during the Montreal Games in 1976, when Lanny Bassham and Margaret Murdock of the United States tied for first place in the small-bore rifle, three positions. Bassham was awarded the gold medal on a technicality but felt that the rule was so inane that he pulled Murdock up to the gold medal platform. She became the first woman to win an Olympic shooting medal.</p>
        <p>Not all gold medal stories end happily. Olga Connolly carried the American flag during the opening ceremony in Munich, but she and her husband were divorced the following year. Vera Caslavska is currently an I.O.C. member from the Czech Republic. She and her husband were divorced in 1992. The following year, their son, Martin, killed his father during a fight.</p>
