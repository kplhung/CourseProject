        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We should applaud Leon Botstein's statement that the federal government has an important part to play in our overly localized system of public education (Op-Ed, Sept. 19). But he misses the point that President Clinton, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman and others associated with the Democratic Leadership Council have been trying to make. New Democrats would argue that a strong federal role can be combined with decentralized administration and local authority.</p>

        <p>There are many ways the federal government can exercise leadership without trying to determine everything that goes on in the schools. So let's try to think anew without being limited by outmoded ideas about government.</p>
