        <p>The people of Yugoslavia will vote on Sunday in what everyone agrees is a watershed election for the future of President Slobodan Milosevic, who trails his main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, in the opinion polls.</p>
        <p>But no one knows how Mr. Milosevic and his government will react to the vote, or how the people of Serbia will respond to that reaction. And no one believes that Mr. Milosevic will suddenly disappear on Monday morning in a cloud of steam, like some wicked witch of the east, leaving only his shoes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica himself believes that Mr. Milosevic will pick from a set of alternatives once the size of the turnout and the electoral results are clearer. A large turnout of five million people would make the election very hard to steal, because Mr. Milosevic would have to come up with nearly a million extra votes to win outright in the first round. If no one wins 50 percent of the vote, there will be a runoff on Oct. 8.</p>
        <p>''I don't think Milosevic knows what to do,'' a hoarse Mr. Kostunica said in an interview today. ''The opposition has not broken, and my candidacy has attracted tremendous support. In these last hours they are hesitating, and Milosevic is going from one solution to another. Those around him cannot tell the emperor everything -- they cannot tell the simple truth that the emperor is naked. And that is sometimes fatal to the emperor.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica is confident that the regime is shaken, and that Mr. Milosevic cannot win in the first round if the count is fair. ''But what the exact results will be and the consequences of two sides claiming victory is another matter,'' he said. ''We'll do our best to avoid any sort of violence and tension, but people will be decisive in defending their victory.''</p>
        <p>Reactions to an election perceived to be stolen could be aggressive in some cities controlled by the opposition. Whatever happens, opposition leaders believe that the political situation in Serbia has been altered permanently after 13 years of Mr. Milosevic's rule.</p>
        <p>''We have won, and Serbia will never be the same after this election,'' said Zoran Djindjic, who led the opposition's campaign. ''Milosevic will never again be able to claim that he is supported by a majority of the people. The question is how to implement this victory. But there is a new reality, this new majority, which will remain regardless of what happens after Monday.''</p>
        <p>For years, Mr. Djindjic said, up to 75 percent of Serbs voted for politics founded in nationalist ambitions, whether promoted by Mr. Milosevic, Vojislav Seselj of the Serbian Radical Party or Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement.</p>
        <p>''For the first time, a majority of Serbs support a normal European democracy,'' Mr. Djindjic said. Mr. Kostunica is himself a moderate nationalist, but a democrat.</p>
        <p>Zarko Korac, another opposition leader, says Mr. Milosevic will not suddenly disappear. ''He's a formidable opponent and it will be a death of a thousand cuts,'' he said. ''This election is a serious cut, which will delegitimize him. But it's a process.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic's aides say his victory is not in doubt. His campaign has been based on appeals to patriotism, fear of the future and a fight against an opposition he has called traitors, NATO lackeys and ''enemies of the people.''</p>
        <p>Ljubisa Ristic, the president of the Yugoslav United Left party of Mr. Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, says he supported new elections within a few months of last year's  NATO bombing, and that it has been a mistake to wait. ''But there is no question that Milosevic will win,'' Mr. Ristic said. ''Whether in the first round or the second round, it's just a matter of prestige.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic could decide to declare victory in the first round and wait to see how Mr. Kostunica and his supporters react; he could say he is ahead but enter a runoff, hoping for lower turnout; he could challenge the results in the courts, citing voter fraud, postponing any resolution; he could have the Federal Election Commission declare the election a fraud and order a new election later.</p>
        <p>That new election could coincide with early elections for the Serbian Parliament, where real power lies here. Or he could even say that he accepts a loss, if he in fact loses, and then maintain power by concentrating on running Serbia.</p>
        <p>In any event, in voting that also takes place on Sunday, Mr. Milosevic is expected to retain control over the federal Parliament -- aided greatly by the boycott of this election by Montenegro's President Milo Djukanovic. In local elections, Mr. Milosevic's coalition is expected to win back some key towns from the opposition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic will also succeed, most experts believe, in cutting down the power of Mr. Seselj, an increasingly ambitious coalition partner. Mr. Milosevic may then turn again to Mr. Draskovic, who refused to back Mr. Kostunica and whose party has lost support.</p>
        <p>But given the personal nature of the system here, Mr. Milosevic is unlikely to want to show weakness, which would diminish his control over his party, the security forces and the country. So the most likely outcomes are a declaration of victory or a legal maneuver that buys time.</p>
        <p>International reaction will also be important, especially from Russia, which has backed Mr. Milosevic. Russia is a member of the Contact Group on Yugoslavia, which has jointly called for a free and fair election. A result that Moscow does not support will do little to help Mr. Milosevic achieve the legitimacy these early elections are designed to provide.</p>
        <p>In another sign of the regime's nervousness, the Foreign Ministry today summoned diplomats to accuse the opposition of planning to declare victory, flee to Montenegro, set up a rival government and request international recognition.</p>
        <p>In the last two days, some 20 Western journalists, especially from television, have been refused permission to cover the elections and been told to leave the country. Visa requests from many Western newspapers were also refused.</p>
