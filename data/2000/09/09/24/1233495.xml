        <p>A lesson learned by NBC from lower-than-expected ratings for the Summer Olympics: five hours a day is too much. In four years, when NBC carries the Summer Games from Athens, a half-hour is likely to be cut, said Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports.</p>
        <p>Through eight days, NBC's 14.7 rating, with a 26 share, is down 16 percent from the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, the last time NBC carried an Olympics from such a distant time zone. (Each rating point equals 1.01 million television households. Share represents the number of televisions in use that are tuned to a particular program.)</p>
        <p>The 14.7 rating is also 21 percent lower than the rating from the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Spain, and 35 percent lower than from the Atlanta Games four years ago.</p>
        <p>NBC decided to add a half-hour, from 7 to 7:30 p.m. Eastern, to its coverage in Sydney. In Atlanta, NBC carried the Olympics from 7:30 p.m. to midnight, but went past midnight.</p>
