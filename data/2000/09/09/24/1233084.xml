        <p>THIS year's Toronto Film Festival, which ended last weekend, highlighted at least one trend worth noting: women directing women in movies that are openly about sex -- not lyrical playhouse lovemaking, but extreme behavior that makes the participants come to grips with the way that sex can ruin lives.</p>
        <p>No one is completed by physical relations in ''Baise-Moi'' ( ''Rape Me''), ''Une Vraie Jeune Fille'' (''A Real Young Girl'') or ''Scarlet Diva'' -- none of which have release dates yet in the United States. The French film ''Baise-Moi,'' co-directed by Virginie Despentes and Coralie Trinh Thi, had to be the most talked about picture at the festival; it happens to be one of the most talked about movies in Europe this year as well. When Manu (Raffaela Anderson) and Nadine (Karen Lancoume), a pair of young Frenchwomen, are raped together, their violation is shown in explicit detail; there is no being spared the horrific act of penetration because the filmmakers don't cut away. Probably the most awful onscreen moment in years is seeing Manu, her face distant and impassive as she's being brutalized. Because she doesn't react, this scene burrows into the most primal fear.</p>

        <p>THIS year's Toronto Film Festival, which ended last weekend, highlighted at least one trend worth noting: women directing women in movies that are openly about sex -- not lyrical playhouse lovemaking, but extreme behavior that makes the participants come to grips with the way that sex can ruin lives.</p>
        <p>No one is completed by physical relations in ''Baise-Moi'' ( ''Rape Me''), ''Une Vraie Jeune Fille'' (''A Real Young Girl'') or ''Scarlet Diva'' -- none of which have release dates yet in the United States. The French film ''Baise-Moi,'' co-directed by Virginie Despentes and Coralie Trinh Thi, had to be the most talked about picture at the festival; it happens to be one of the most talked about movies in Europe this year as well. When Manu (Raffaela Anderson) and Nadine (Karen Lancoume), a pair of young Frenchwomen, are raped together, their violation is shown in explicit detail; there is no being spared the horrific act of penetration because the filmmakers don't cut away. Probably the most awful onscreen moment in years is seeing Manu, her face distant and impassive as she's being brutalized. Because she doesn't react, this scene burrows into the most primal fear.</p>
        <p>During this scene, a gasp -- the kind that the extras in movie crowd scenes never get right -- erupted in the theater, and a number of people rose shakily to their feet to exit. It is such a powerful sequence that one strains to imagine what could follow it, and, unfortunately, the directors did not strain their imaginations enough. After the repellent cruelty, the stars of ''Baise-Moi'' chase thrills and wreak their vengeance on men. The movie could be described as ''Thelma and Louise Get Busy.'' When the movie plops into the grinding ordinariness of a porno film, complete with a second-rate score with chittering wah-wah guitars and bleating horns, all the horror that the film conjured up is lost.</p>
        <p>The real shock of this film is the inability of the directors to seize upon the discomfort of the audience and expose them to Manu and Nadine's suffering. As a result, the slender border between art and exploitation is quickly destroyed, and when the two women begin their violent spree, the cheap-looking splatter of viscera distracts the audience with its cheesy violence. Something raw and haunted has been squandered, and it's understandable that by following this trail of gore, these characters are chasing what little self-esteem they had in the first place.</p>
        <p>Asia Argento, the daughter of the Italian genre filmmaker Dario Argento, starred in, wrote and directed ''Scarlet Diva.'' In it she seeks to expose the yearning consuming her. Parts of her depiction of -- gasp -- the violence coursing through her psyche in a roaring version of her own life seem sophomoric and half-baked: the B-picture as therapy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Argento's presence and inchoate quality as an actress occasionally move the picture from caricature into something more three-dimensional. With her dazed eyes and strong shoulders, she has the look of a model who turns a stroll down a fashion runway into a march along the perp walk; she's an arresting combination of fear and arrogance, and her story almost functions as an addled version of ''Candide'' without Dr. Pangloss to lend a whiff of optimism. She seems to be trying to say something about the emptiness of her life, and the onslaught of cliches of meaningless sex and drugs leaves even her bored. She's still finding her way as a performer, trying on American hip-hop dialect and then bouncing from French to Italian; it's like she's going through exercises for an acting class. She's not exactly in control of the material, and ''Diva'' lurches from humid sex scenes to meaningful stares into space to slipshod indictments of the American film industry, as evidenced by a scene in which a loutish producer comes on to her like a pig digging around for truffles.</p>
        <p>''Une Vraie Jeune Fille,'' the first film from the French novelist-turned-director Catherine Breillat, about a young woman's discovery of herself as a sexual being, made its North American debut at this year's festival. The ''Jeune Fille'' screenings provoked interest because of ''Romance,'' Ms. Breillat's mournful treatise on sexual encounters, which was released last year and stirred a sensation of its own because of its explicit sex. Although her directing technique in ''Jeune Fille'' (1976) was primitive and attenuated, there was an aura of heartache which added a depth of feeling missing in her more recent work.</p>
        <p>The American director Kathryn Bigelow showed up at Toronto with her newest work, a film adaptation of Anita Shreve's ''Weight of Water'' that stars Catherine McCormack and Sarah Polley. The gothic and allusive ''Water'' has parallel stories that shift back and forth in time over the course of 100 years: the events surrounding the murders of the sister and sister-in-law of a young woman (Ms. Polley) are being investigated by a modern-day writer (Ms. McCormack), as contemporary and period sexual politics come into play. In discussing her film, Ms. Bigelow posed a question that could serve as the theme for all of these women's works: ''If a woman is pushed to the edge, how would she behave?''</p>
        <p>''I hate to put it in gender specific terms, but women internalize,'' said Ms. Bigelow, whose previous films include ''Near Dark'' and ''Blue Steel.'' Her movies trade on the frighteningly close relationship between intimacy and violence, and her films illustrate how quickly one can cross the line into the other. ''Filmmaking is an opportunity to externalize,'' she continued. ''I started as a painter, an Abstract Expressionist, dealing with the visceral. Painting can be a fairly elitist medium, and film is accessible to all, it cuts across all cultural and social lines. What you can do in movies -- what I did in 'Weight of Water' -- is have the characters commit heinous acts, and you can feel sympathy for them, sympathy for marginal acts.''</p>
