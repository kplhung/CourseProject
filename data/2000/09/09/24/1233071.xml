        <p>THOSE who hear the trumpeter Wallace Roney at Birdland in Manhattan this week will experience the art of one of the musicians most responsible for the jazz renaissance that took off in the early 1980's. They will also hear one of the best band leaders in the music, for Mr. Roney has found a personal way of fusing his three major influences on composition, arranging and group playing -- Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Herbie Hancock, informed by the studying and the playing that he did with Ornette Coleman.</p>
        <p>What one hears is a manipulation of the simple and the complex as well a conception to improvising in which forms and approaches can be reordered on the spot, allowing the players to redefine melody, harmony and rhythm with the kind of freedom that makes each performance suspenseful, thrilling and unpredictable.</p>
        <p>That should be expected of Mr. Roney, who was highly regarded by his peers long before he achieved public recognition. Born in Philadelphia in 1960, he grew up in a soulful household; his father's favorite musician was Miles Davis and his mother's was Thelonious Monk. So he always heard premier jazz improvising. He began studying music and trumpet at 5. By his teens, he was attending Duke Ellington High School for the Performing Arts in Washington, and his name had a big star next to it in the undergound of young musicians. In 1979, he won the Down Beat magazine award for best young jazz musician of the year.</p>
        <p>But such early praise for Mr. Roney was not always shared by music critics. He was often dismissed as being little more than a clone of Miles Davis. It was the critics' way of saying that for Mr. Roney to base his work on that of a great musician is somehow a sin against the kind of contrivance often described as ''cutting edge.'' Yet the depth of his talent is something that other musicians have long recognized.</p>
        <p>''I had first heard about Wallace Roney when I was in high school,'' said Wynton Marsalis. ''People told me that there was someone serious who was from Washington. And when I first met him, I was astonished by how much music he knew and how much of it came through his horn when he was playing. He has maintained that level of seriousness throughout all of the years since then. This man has never been swayed, which is an achievement of very high integrity in this era.''</p>
        <p>I recall first hearing Mr. Roney in 1976 at Ali's Alley, the short-lived but hot club in SoHo owned by Rashiedc Ali, John Coltrane's last drummer. Mr. Roney, a shy, dark-skinned and good-looking 16-year-old making his New York debut, sat in with the drummer Philly Joe Jones. As soon as Mr. Roney commenced to swing, the noise level in the club immediately dropped off, and those in the middle of conversations or laughing and joking turned their attention to the bandstand. People in the back room came out to hear that horn. There was plenty of Lee Morgan in that trumpet playing, and the passion for jazz was so thorough that the atmosphere inside the club was completely rearranged. At the end of the tune, the room took on a crazily jubilant mood, and the clapping wouldn't stop.</p>
        <p>The saxophonist Greg Osby met Mr. Roney while they were both 18-year-old students at the Berklee School of Music in Boston. Mr. Osby says that even then Mr. Roney was impressing his fellow musicians and that that high regard has changed little since.</p>
        <p>''What most people still don't know is that he is a very, very gifted musician,'' Mr. Osby said. ''Not only does he have perfect pitch, but he has the supreme version of it. I've seen him outline entire arrangements without aid of his trumpet or a piano. Wallace also turned me on to the essentials of improvisational navigation. He detailed the finer points of melodious logic, how phrases related to one another and how the melody related to the chords that were implied.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Osby recalls Mr. Roney having once written out the chord changes to the standard ''Cherokee'' for him. ''I still have a cassette of us playing that,'' Mr. Osby said. ''He's playing piano and I'm playing saxophone. That's my first attempt at relating harmony to melodic output. I'll never forget that.''</p>
        <p>By the early 80's, Mr. Roney was a well-schooled trumpet player, fully aware of the tradition from Louis Armstrong forward. The bassist Peter Washington observed those qualities when he worked with Mr. Roney in Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers.</p>
        <p>''I'm still amazed at his knowledge of all aspects of jazz -- brass, reeds, piano, bass, drums, arrangements and everything else,'' Mr. Washington said. ''He was always studying and trying to better his playing and his understanding of music on every level. His harmonic vocabulary is encyclopedic. He can play out of any harmonic bag he wants to. The point he's at right now, he's just playing what he hears. He's completely free to do whatever he wants to do.''</p>
        <p>That encyclopedic knowledge and freedom are the result of working with a range of musicians that stretches from Jay McShann to Ornette Coleman and includes Philly Joe Jones, Cedar Walton, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Tony Williams, Elvin Jones and Sonny Rollins, some of the most respected names in jazz. That bandstand experience explains why Miles Davis selected him to be a guest at Davis's 1991 Montreux concert, which was one of his last, and why he was invited to perform at the party for Mr. Coleman's 70th birthday party earlier this year.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, jazz was considered passe, but Mr. Roney, like Mr. Marsalis, was at the forefront of the movement that reasserted the timeless vitality of the art. He was investigating the free melodic invention and harmonic juggling that were characteristic of Davis, Coltrane, Mr. Coleman and Mr. Shorter -- seemingly unfazed by the unflattering comparisons to Davis.</p>
        <p>The results were clear to musicians like the saxophonist George Coleman. ''You don't hear anybody else but Wallace who can handle that way-out chromatic stuff that Miles Davis was playing,'' he said. ''Nobody else can hear what it is. To pick something like that, which nobody else has done, and play it with that kind of precision, you have to respect the originality of that.''</p>
        <p>The bassist Ron Carter, who worked in Davis's last great quintet and has shared many bandstands with Mr. Roney, further defends him against his critics: ''Wallace seems to be the only trumpet player who understands how Miles did what he did. He didn't just imitate the order of the notes; he understands why they are in that order. Because he understands the concept way past the imitator stage, he's able to develop it to the next level of harmony, space, phrasing and achieve his own individuality. It's time people began to recognize that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Washington maintains that Mr. Roney long ago developed ''his own big, dark sound.'' It is also true that  the influence of the trumpeter Don Cherry on Mr. Roney has never been appropriately noted. Overlooked is the fact that his playing expresses glee, pathos, sudden and unexpected emotions, as well as the noble gloom, sensuality and humor passed down from Davis to Cherry.</p>
        <p>WHAT makes Mr. Roney most interesting at the moment, however, is the way in which he is working with his band, trying to define an ensemble approach in which each player can remake his or her part in reaction to what the featured performer is doing. Mr. Roney's music embodies the essence of jazz, both taking advantage of and building on the past. Like all superior jazz musicians, he grounds his music in swing, blues, ballads and Afro-Hispanic rhythms. Even records as superbly realized as ''The Wallace Quintet'' and ''Village'' do not capture the fire, nuance and adventure of his public performances. So the best chance to experience the work of this artist is to sit in the audience and be taken to some fresh places.</p>
