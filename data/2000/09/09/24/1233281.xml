        <p>THE SETTING -- At the Ziegfeld Theater on Tuesday, girls in blue satin sashes tripped about, as if they were part of Fashion Week. There was a multitude of nuns, one in black cargo pants. A contingent from the Village Light Opera Group, a community troupe, had paper snowflakes stuck to their noses and eyelashes. Men tucked plastic sprigs of edelweiss (provided in a goody bag along with one of those confetti-spewing poppers) behind their ears.</p>
        <p>It was a cult movie for the normal set: ''Sing-a-Long Sound of Music,'' the 1965 Julie Andrews movie with the lyrics given in subtitles.</p>

        <p>THE SETTING -- At the Ziegfeld Theater on Tuesday, girls in blue satin sashes tripped about, as if they were part of Fashion Week. There was a multitude of nuns, one in black cargo pants. A contingent from the Village Light Opera Group, a community troupe, had paper snowflakes stuck to their noses and eyelashes. Men tucked plastic sprigs of edelweiss (provided in a goody bag along with one of those confetti-spewing poppers) behind their ears.</p>
        <p>It was a cult movie for the normal set: ''Sing-a-Long Sound of Music,'' the 1965 Julie Andrews movie with the lyrics given in subtitles.</p>
        <p>First, a comedienne warmed up the crowd. (The confetti, she warned, was only for when Georg and Maria kiss. ''No premature popping!'') Then came a costume contest in which one man wore a foam Statue of Liberty hat with the spikes converted into the Alps, and another, covered in cellophane-wrapped snack cakes, explained he was a yodel. After that, the film began.</p>
        <p>''Maria!'' the crowd screamed as the camera panned the Austrian mountains for the kajillionth time in celluloid history. ''Maaaarrriiiiiiaaaaa!'' And there she was, twirling across the meadow. She sang, and the crowd sang with her.</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- ''This is like 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' for dorks,'' said Victoria Redmond, an investment banker, while a friend, Emma Estrich, tugged a white turtleneck around her head as the first layer of a nun's habit.</p>
        <p>Paula Hornbostel had gathered with a fellow Upper East Sider, Tricia Paik, and other friends for apple strudel and schnapps before the screening. Ms. Paik, who studies art, was wearing her ''abstract interpretation of raindrops on roses'': blue paper drops stuck to a pink sweater. Martha Flach, 34, of the West Village, was more literal: she had retrieved her mother's dirndl, ''a family heirloom,'' from storage.</p>
        <p>But once the singalong began, the movie's apple-cheeked Austrians would have blushed to hear the crowd's good-naturedly lewd comments. When Georg reminded Maria that his No. 1 rule was discipline, the audience cooed knowingly.</p>
        <p>And when Maria gaily took up her guitar and asked the children what to play, the audience answered ''Freebird!'' -- a Lynyrd Skynrd song that has become an anthem of stadium rock.</p>
        <p>At intermission, the film was parsed in terms of modern pop psychology. Was Liesl in love with her father? Did Rolf dye his eyebrows?</p>
        <p>But the close reading was only a sign of how deep the memories were lodged. ''My mother made me sing these songs when I was 5 or 6,'' said Eric Siddall, 25, of Murray Hill. ''I think that's why I'm gay, actually.''</p>
        <p>Not all was mockery. As the Nazis lay in wait during the Von Trapps' performance, the audience forgot, for the first time, to sing along.</p>
        <p>But then, the family got itself to the nunnery, and as the Nazis searched, some viewers stood up, sweeping the crowd with the beams of flashlights brought from home.</p>
