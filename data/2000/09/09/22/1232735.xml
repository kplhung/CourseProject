        <p>Directed by Ruth Leitman  Not rated; 94 minutes</p>
        <p>Perhaps the time has come to retire Tolstoy's famous ''Anna Karenina'' dictum, ''Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.''</p>
        <p>In this confessional age, when the high and hoi polloi jostle one another for the right to make the public privy to their darkest secrets, even unhappy families are beginning to seem alike.</p>
        <p>A case in point is ''Alma,'' Ruth Leitman's Southern Gothic documentary about the Thorpe family, particularly big, blowsy Alma, the faded 55-year-old 200-pound beauty who is mater of this dysfunctional familias. The other participants in this skewed pas de trois are Alma's husband, the taciturn Jim, and their daughter, the resentful Marge, whose relationships with men never seem to last.</p>
        <p>And what have we here? Statutory rape, wife beating, alcoholism, bizarre religiosity, warlock voices, sexual fantasy, infidelity, institutionalization, shock treatment, arrests, denial, lingering psychic injury to children: a catalog of behavior and relationships that stray from the ideal in ways that have become daily fodder for all manner of voracious public consumption.</p>
        <p>''Everyone I'm related to is some weird comical pervert,'' Alma says. She says she lost her virginity at 8 to an uncle she seduced. Marge says that Alma told her that Elvis Presley, encountered in a sexual dream world, is probably her father. ''I am what you call a nymphomaniac,'' Alma says.</p>
        <p>Marge says, ''I don't know why I come off hating men.''</p>
        <p>Figuratively and literally, including Marge's childhood snapshots of her parents coupling, ''Alma'' is not a pretty picture, and Ms. Leitman, with the collaboration of her friend Marge and the eccentric, endlessly garrulous Alma, has seized the opportunity to capture it raw and bring it back alive.</p>
        <p>But watching the camera watch Marge provoke the diabetic Alma into a journey into her troubled past is a little like watching someone prod a sick animal with a stick just to enjoy the reaction. After a while, ''Alma,'' which opens today at Anthology Film Archives (32 Second Avenue at Second Street, East Village), begins to seem not so much  an examination but an exploitation, a record of behavior that lacks a dispassionate voice capable of adding to mankind's store of understanding, and lacks compassion.</p>
        <p>It's sight without insight.</p>
