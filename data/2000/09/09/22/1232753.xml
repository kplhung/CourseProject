        <p>Scholten Japanese Art</p>
        <p>63 East 66th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>Through Sunday</p>
        <p>Scholten, based in the Netherlands, is inaugurating its New York branch with this brief public exhibition; after Sunday, the gallery will be open by appointment only. Organized by Katherine Martin, the show is installed on three floors of a renovated town house whose white walls and swept-clean surfaces make a shrewd foil to the small, intricately wrought objects on view.</p>
        <p>Most of them date from the 18th and 19th centuries, when an urban middle class was flush in Japan and conspicuous consumption was the order of the day. Materialist appetite and social sophistication meet in the gallery's selection of inro, carved lacquer containers meant to be suspended from a man's belt, and in the ivory or wooden toggles known as netsuke, which translate folktales, jokes and historical references into precious, pocket-size sculptures.</p>
        <p>And the social climate is memorably summed up, in a single piece: a stacked box made of fitted containers and trays, its surfaces covered with painted landscapes, inlaid birds and gilt patterning. Practically every lacquer technique known gets a workout to create an object of staggering formal finesse, expensive gorgeousness and almost zero utility.</p>
