        <p>The main event in this solo debut is a continuous 75-minute compendium of dozens of short videos made by Mr. Kimball in the last several years. They were all filmed in his art-cluttered New York apartment; he is the only performer. He lounges around in the nude, stretches his face through a distorting lense, and plays several roles, including that of a geek artist named Art who calls phone numbers he's found on bathroom walls in hopes of landing a date to an exclusive art world event.</p>

        <p>The main event in this solo debut is a continuous 75-minute compendium of dozens of short videos made by Mr. Kimball in the last several years. They were all filmed in his art-cluttered New York apartment; he is the only performer. He lounges around in the nude, stretches his face through a distorting lense, and plays several roles, including that of a geek artist named Art who calls phone numbers he's found on bathroom walls in hopes of landing a date to an exclusive art world event.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, he has no luck, and his persistence in failure as well as his no-holds-barred self-exposure, whether real or convincingly acted, give the films their collective texture: they are hilarious but also creepy, which for some reason makes them touching.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimball's manic energy -- which is what he means by enthusiasm, I think -- extends into the gallery itself, where he has reconstituted elements from his apartment, including paintings, caches of tchotchkes and a wall-to-wall curtain of dangling pipe-cleaner chains. In decorative instinct, as in his personal style, Mr. Kimball is something of a trial, and I am a big fan.</p>
        <p>This weekend, by the way, is a good time to visit the Williamsburg-Greenpoint area. Tomorrow and Sunday all 33 galleries in the art-intensive neighborhoods will be open from noon to 8 p.m.; dealer-led gallery tours will be in session, and shuttle buses will be on hand to help with navigation.</p>
        <p>When dropping by Pierogi, be sure to note the drawings by the Brooklyn artist Daniel Zeller on the reception area wall, and dip into the gallery's famously rich flat files to see more: light of touch, Mr. Zeller's abstract images resemble both topographic landscapes and microscopic close-ups, and they're exquisite.</p>
