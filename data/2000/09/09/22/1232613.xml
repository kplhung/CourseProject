        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The plan to use retired teachers to alleviate a shortage in New York City (front page, Sept. 15) is a good one. But we should consider flex-time.</p>
        <p>For example, two retired teachers could split a five-day job. One teacher would work two days and the other three, perhaps alternating each semester. The fifth day could even be used by one of them to do lab work, work in small groups or give attention to those who need extra help. Such programs would be team teaching at its best, stimulating the teachers involved in the planning as well as the students.</p>

        <p>Many of the retired teachers have told me that they would never return to teaching five classes a day, five days a week. With flex-time, they might accept the challenge.</p>
