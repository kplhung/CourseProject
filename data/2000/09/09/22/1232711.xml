        <p>Plans by the Nassau County executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, to cut aid to Long Island Bus would risk destroying a public transportation network that serves more than 100,000 riders a day, a coalition of transportation groups said today.</p>
        <p>Protesting a key part of Mr. Gulotta's multiyear plan to rescue the county's troubled finances, leaders of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a nonprofit advocacy group, said they wanted to draw attention to the issue before it was too late.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to send a message to the County Legislature to stop the cuts before they get to the finalized budget,'' said Christopher R. Hewitt, the Long Island coordinator for the organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, has proposed slashing next year's subsidy for Long Island Bus to $11 million -- including financing for a handicapped passengers program -- and nearly eliminating the subsidy altogether in 2002. The proposals are part of his budget plan submitted last week. If that plan fails to meet the approval of a state monitoring board, the Nassau Interim Financing Authority, the board could take over control of the county finances.</p>
        <p>Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the presiding officer of the Nassau County Legislature, said: ''We are gravely concerned about a cut that affects the ability of people in this county to get to work. It literally goes to the heart and the core of concern.''</p>
        <p>Because her staff is still analyzing Mr. Gulotta's budget, Ms. Jacobs could not say whether the legislature would reject the bus proposal.</p>
        <p>Robert W. Lazaro, a spokesman for Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader of the Legislature, said the Gulotta administration should try to obtain additional financing through the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Long Island Bus's parent agency.</p>
        <p>Long Island bus has a total budget of $84 million this year. Of that, it takes in $33.6 million in fares from passengers on 328 buses in 54 routes in Nassau, eastern Queens and western Suffolk.</p>
        <p>Long Island Bus had sought a $26.2 million subsidy from Nassau County for 2000, but the county included just $20.7 million in its year 2000 budget.</p>
        <p>In December, Mr. Gulotta cut $7 million from the county's subsidy, leaving Long Island Bus with a $12.5 million deficit and facing a 40 percent cut in service, said Neil S. Yellin, president of Long Island Bus.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, to keep the bus service whole, Dean G. Skelos, a Republican who is deputy majority leader of the Senate, and Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, the county Democratic chairman, devised a plan to provide the bus service with $8 million in state aid this year. Gov. George E. Pataki increased that amount by $750,000 in transit operating assistance.</p>
        <p>The bus service saved $2.5 million this year with new sources of revenue and cuts in nonoperational service. It also started a hiring freeze for jobs not related to service.</p>
        <p>In June, Mr. Gulotta proposed another $7 million cut, but it was rejected by the County Legislature. Mr. Gulotta budgeted just $11.4 million in total county subsidy in 2001, and has proposed cutting $7 million more in 2002, leaving the bus service nearly unsubsidized by the county.</p>
        <p>In an interview Wednesday, Mr. Gulotta said he would expect the state to pick up more of the costs of running the bus service.</p>
        <p>''Does the state have a surplus?'' Mr. Gulotta said. ''Does Nassau County have a deficit? Perhaps there could be some help there.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. DiNapoli said the prospect of more state help was unclear at best, especially since state legislators do not return to Albany until January.</p>
