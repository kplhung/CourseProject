        <p>In an effort that could help reverse the impact of the state's ban on affirmative action, the president of the University of California proposed yesterday that the university guarantee provisional admission to the top 12.5 percent of students at every high school.</p>
        <p>The university now guarantees admission to the top 4 percent of high school graduates, provided they take a college preparatory curriculum.</p>
        <p>The president, Richard C. Atkinson, said the new admission plan should bring in about 12,000 additional students, more than a third black, Hispanic or Native American. Only about 12 percent of the students who now meet the university's regular admissions criteria are members of those groups, and at the university's most selective campuses, at Berkeley and Los Angeles, minority representation is much lower.</p>
        <p>The plan needs to be approved by the university's faculty and the Board of Regents. Mr. Atkinson said yesterday that he had begun to brief both groups and that based on the responses so far, he was optimistic that they would approve it.</p>
        <p>State colleges in Texas and Florida have also ended race-based preferences. Texas now admits the top 10 percent of its high school students, and Florida admits the top 20 percent. But the proposed California plan would require intermediate steps for many of the students.</p>
        <p>Those who did not immediately meet its eligibility requirements would be asked to attend a community college first. If they successfully complete a program designed to prepare them for the university and maintain a certain average, they would be guaranteed a place at one of the university's campuses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Atkinson said that by expanding the university's total enrollment, the plan would not put at a disadvantage students who are now eligible for admission.</p>
        <p>''The goal here is to increase diversity,'' Mr. Atkinson said. ''Diversity in terms of low-income students, diversity in terms of under-represented minority students, diversity in terms of rural students.''</p>
        <p>The number of black, Hispanic and Native American students at the university has plummeted in recent years, following California's abolition of affirmative action programs.</p>
        <p>In 1995, the university voted to prohibit the consideration of race and sex in admission decisions, a policy that took effect in 1998. In the separate initiative in 1996, California voters passed Proposition 209, which prohibits the consideration of race and sex in hiring, contracting and university admissions.</p>
        <p>In the fall 1998 freshman class, the first to enroll at Berkeley after the ban, the number of black students dropped by more than half, and Hispanic enrollment decreased by 43 percent.</p>
        <p>The university currently admits the top 12.5 percent of students in the state regardless of high school,  through a system based on their high school grades and SAT scores, so long as they have taken the preparatory curriculum that it requires. But those students tend to come from the state's stronger schools.</p>
        <p>This year, in an effort to reach more widely, the university also began to offer admission to the top 4 percent of the students at each high school in the state. University officials said that 82 percent of the high schools in the state were participating.</p>
        <p>Michael Cowan, chairman of the university's faculty senate, said that the members of the senate who were briefed by the president on Wednesday saw it as part of the university's ongoing effort to improve access for all groups in the state -- a goal they support -- and would give the proposal ''a very serious hearing and review.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cowan, a professor of American studies and literature at the Santa Cruz campus, said he viewed the plan as quite promising.</p>
        <p>But Ward Connerly, a University of California regent and the architect of the state's 1996 referendum against affirmative action, said he needed more information before he could decide whether to support or oppose the proposal. He said he wanted to know whether other applicants would be displaced, whether the quality of the student body would be diluted and what intent was behind the proposal.</p>
        <p>''It is O.K. for us to say we want to improve diversity,'' Mr. Connerly said. ''But if we say we want to improve the representation of under-represented minorities, we're breaking the law.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Atkinson said the plan remained within the state's strictures on singling out any population for admission.</p>
        <p>University officials say that the earliest students would be enrolled under the proposed plan would be Sept. 2002 but that 2003 was more likely.</p>
        <p>How well the new plan would work would depend on what happened to the students directed to the community colleges for preparatory work.</p>
        <p>Morton O. Schapiro, an expert on higher education and president of Williams College, said that traditionally, of the students who intend to go on for a bachelor's degree when they entered a community college, fewer than 20 percent actually did.</p>
        <p>University officials acknowledged that difficulty but said they hoped they could raise the transfer rate by counseling the students and making sure they knew what courses they needed to transfer smoothly.</p>
        <p>Thomas Nussbaum, chancellor of the state's community college system, said that about a quarter of the 1.6 million students in the state's 108 community colleges say they want to transfer and that slightly more than half of that group succeed.</p>
        <p>Each year, he said, about 10,000 go on to the University of California.</p>
        <p>Some of the university campuses already work closely with the community colleges near them, Mr. Nussbaum said, adding that he hoped that could be a model for the rest. California's recent decision to give more than $1 billion in new financial aid should also help, he said.</p>
        <p>''We are not starting from zero here,'' he said.</p>
