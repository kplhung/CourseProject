        <p>Down came the white-coated servers with trays of miniature skewered fruit. Down came the honeydew melon juiced into iced tumblers. Down, too, came the coffee in Safari-pattern demitasses, the Champagne in crystal flutes, tray after tray of enticements descending a spiral stair, as Hermes opened its long-awaited store at 691 Madison Avenue on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>After numerous delays, the 163-year-old saddlery-turned-rich-man's-toy-shop was ready for its debut. Inside it felt, said Laurent Mommeja-Hermes, president and chief executive of Hermes USA, ''like a haven of serenity in hectic New York.''</p>
        <p>Hermes calm, as is well known, is not the kind you get from a yoga mat and a scented candle. It's the secure inner buzz that comes from knowing you have $385 to spend on a beach towel, $765 for a cat bed or $1,000 for a tray of ash and woven leather to hold your mail. So what if it is filled with dunning notices, Val-Paks and the usual box-cluttering catalogs? After all, can everyone's Val-Paks afford Hermes?</p>
        <p>Few people have a more intimate understanding of the critical relationship between perception and reality in the luxury goods trade, between a garden trowel that costs $2.95 at Home Depot and one that costs $185, than Mr. Mommeja-Hermes. Havens of serenity are one thing. But even as he extolled the splendors of the 20,200-square-foot store (hand-sewn leather bannisters, nickel vitrines, Pennsylvania cherry-wood fittings -- let's not get into construction cost overruns), Mr. Mommeja-Hermes was quick to point out, ''Starting tomorrow, the cash register is on.''</p>
        <p>The phrase was repeated that evening, this time to an overflow crowd of invited guests. Of the many Fashion Week parties, Hermes's had the strongest advance hype. Dozens of giant wood replicas of the signature orange Hermes box were erected on Madison Avenue. Jean-Paul Goude, who is known for his Chanel Egoiste commercial, for his staging of the French bicentennial parade and for marrying Grace Jones, had been hired to create what he called a ''Christo-esque'' spectacle, which ultimately involved hydraulic lifts, buglers in hunt jackets and ballerinas from the Beriozka company in Russia glissading down a runway to ''Swan Lake.''</p>
        <p>The real spectacle turned out to be the crowd itself, a full array of New York's gratin, dressed to kill, and fully prepared to do just that when they found themselves crushed in an impossibly long entry line. ''This is a joke,'' a celebrity financier said as he surveyed a mob that included Nadja Auerman, the Amazonian model; Christian Louboutin, the diminutive shoemaker; and Diane Von Furstenberg, the enterprising designer, who cleverly ducked down 62nd Street, climbed a grate and sneaked in. ''It's God's joke,'' replied a bystander squashed against the police barricades. Just then a bugler's horn sounded, and Rudolph W. Giuliani appeared on the catwalk.</p>
        <p>Lest anyone think the action was all in the tents this week, consider Fashionlab 2000, a performance and installation collaboration that, as its curator, a man who calls himself Ggrippo, explained the other day, ''examines and reinterprets the form, structure and message of a runway show.'' Hold on to your deconstructionist hat!</p>
        <p>Staged Thursday night in a parking garage in Chelsea, which was covered in shrink wrap for the occasion by the designers at LOT/EK, Fashionlab 2000 was the third such installation put on in conjunction with the Downtown Arts Festival and Fashion Laboratories for the Environment. Although not viewable before press time, the  installation was characterized by Ggrippo, a Brooklyn-based artist, as ''basically a big environment with photography, design, video and a collaboration between four or five art teams.''</p>
        <p>Getting dressed in a postmodern landscape is no longer an uncomplicated act. ''Whatever you carry with you has to have a meaning,'' Ggrippo said by phone the other day, in his idiosyncratic English. Fashion has an imperative, he added, ''not to be something anonymous, what Vogue tells you to wear.'' It's the unexamined fashion life, it would seem, that's not worth living. ''Your clothes have to be evaluated,'' and your wardrobe interrogated, Ggrippo said, ''because if not, maybe you're already dead.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, a sign posted backstage at Hussein Chalayan's show at Roseland for Tse New York gave instructions to the models -- Trish, Angela, Gisele and the photographers' new favorite, Hannelore. ''This is real life,'' it read in large handwritten block letters. ''Go back to your basics elements. Be Yourself. Stay Relaxed Yet Energetic (But not too fast!) Focused and strong. Not model-y at all. You are self confidant and strong.'' Who cares if you can't spell?</p>
        <p>''They can't even put them on until the moment they go out,'' Cynthia Rowley said yesterday, backstage at the Pavilion tent in Bryant Park. She was referring to $500,000 in Jean Schlumberger jewels lent for the occasion by Tiffany. Guards were posted at both runway entrance and exit. ''The models have to take the jewels off the minute they get back,'' Ms. Rowley noted, ''unless I get to them first.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 23, 2000, Saturday  A report in the Diary column yesterday about Fashionlab 2000, a multimedia collaboration between artists and clothing designers at Eyebeam Atelier, 540-48 West 21st Street in Manhattan, misstated the date.
