        <p>George Vecsey Sports of The Times column discusses praise heaped upon Patrick Ewing by fellow players and opposing coaches following his being traded to Seattle SuperSonics by New York Knickerbockers (M)</p>

        <p>ON the way over to the game, Vin Baker and Gary Payton were giving each other ostentatious high-fives. The two teammates from Seattle sat in the back of the bus and yakked it up about how the order of the National Basketball Association had just done a major flip.</p>
        <p>''Zo won't see him,'' Baker was saying. ''Steve Smith knows things have changed in Portland. We just got better.''</p>
        <p>Patrick Ewing's closest competitor and closest friend, Alonzo Mourning of Miami -- whose life just got easier -- was indignant that New York should be lukewarm toward Ewing. ''He's given them his loyalty, and they treat him like this,'' Mourning said, meaning the Knicks' organization, but also the fans and the news media. ''He's a good person, and a great player.''</p>
        <p>Despite the gasps in the stands in New York when Patrick handled the ball in the closing seconds, a dozen members of the United States Olympic basketball team profess that Ewing is still near the top of his game.</p>
        <p>They heard the news from afar that Ewing had been shipped to Seattle in a huge four-team deal and they went out and survived Lithuania, 85-76. Afterward, they worked the steel barricades known as the mixed zone, giving interviews to swarms of reporters. These pragmatic professionals seemed to have nothing in common with the fans who lamented the occasional missed foul shots and fumbled passes, or the reporters who found Ewing remote and self-centered, or the top Garden executives who praised Ewing in public but zinged him in private, and ultimately worked hard to ship him out of town.</p>
        <p>Ewing is not the first player to think he is worth a multiyear contract late in his career, and hardly the first player to want to hang on in his original town. You can't blame a fella for trying. Cal Ripken Jr. has calcified into a civic memorial at third base in Baltimore. Dan Marino probably had to be nudged into retirement in Miami.</p>
        <p>Both of them, however, will remain beloved in their towns, despite the clumsiness of their latter months. Ewing may come to Madison Square Garden as a visiting player, accepting the cheers but remaining somebody who was only passing through. At the very least, it is instructive that the professionals think of Ewing as an enduring force.</p>
        <p>''This puts us among the elite,'' Baker said of his new N.B.A. teammate. ''Patrick's one of the best centers of all time.''</p>
        <p>Mourning, who used to be pushed around by his Georgetown buddy, was asked whether he would miss Ewing in the East. He had to know the Knicks are not likely to neutralize him with Luc Longley and Travis Knight at center.</p>
        <p>''Patrick is still in the league,'' Mourning said, his eyes flaring wide. ''The question is: will New York miss him?''</p>
        <p>Allan Houston, the soft-spoken shooter with the Knicks, must contemplate sharing finite time and a solitary basketball with both Latrell Sprewell and Glen Rice.</p>
        <p>''Everybody said Spree and I couldn't play together, but we did,'' Houston said. ''Everybody said Shaq and Kobe and Rice couldn't play together, but they did. Now Seattle has three great players. You can work it out. That's the way the N.B.A. is. Five years ago, this would have bothered me, but you have to play for yourself and your family, and have faith. I know we're going to miss Patrick. He's one of the great players in this league.''</p>
        <p>Larry Brown, an assistant with the national team, said he had tried to get Ewing for his Philadelphia team when it became obvious the Knicks were going to move their star.</p>
        <p>''He would have helped our team, and one player in particular,'' Brown said, alluding to Allen Iverson, the edgy guard who passed through Georgetown on his way to the N.B.A. ''We had some great games with Patrick when I was at Indiana. He's a great player.''</p>
        <p>One person who passed along the mixed zone thought the Knicks might have come out ahead. That was Donnie Nelson, who has a longtime gig as an assistant to the Lithuania team, and is the son and assistant to the Dallas coach, Don Nelson. The father was once eased out by the Knicks when Ewing became disenchanted with him, but the son, one of the class acts in his sport, showed no sign of animosity as he discussed the trade.</p>
        <p>''They come out smelling like a rose,'' Nelson said. ''They lost some bulk in Patrick and Chris Dudley, but Luc and Knight are a good combination. Patrick is Patrick. He's no spring chicken.''</p>
        <p>Nelson's was a minority opinion. Patrick Ewing's colleagues are sticking up for him, with a passion that Ewing himself could never show.</p>
