        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton turned her attention back to upstate New York today, flying here to attack Representative Rick A. Lazio for asserting that the region's beleaguered economy had ''turned a corner.'' Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Lazio's remark demonstrated that he was ''out of touch'' with a part of New York that should be the foundation of his political base.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton returned to the site of last week's Senate debate to rebut, a week later, Mr. Lazio's sunny characterization of the economy here. Mr. Lazio's statement has stirred concern among his Republican supporters in this part of the state, and Mrs. Clinton's aides said she would  use it as part of her effort, unusually aggressive for a Democrat, to win support in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>To that end, Mrs. Clinton gave a 27-minute speech to a Rotary Club luncheon today, reprising some of her economic development proposals while asserting that Mr. Lazio's had shown no concern with the condition of the economy.</p>
        <p>''My opponent has said that upstate has already turned the corner, and I can only conclude that he hasn't seen what I've seen, or talked with the people that I've talked to,'' Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to make improving the upstate economy my personal commitment.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference afterward, Mrs. Clinton added: ''I don't think he has a plan for upstate. And I think that is regrettable, and it's a real oversight on his part. To me, his denial of there being a problem demonstrates how out of touch he is with upstate.''</p>
        <p>At the debate, Mr. Lazio said: ''I do believe that the upstate economy here has turned the corner. I think my opponent would like people to believe that upstate is a vast economic wasteland. It is not. As a matter of fact, there's been great progress.''</p>
        <p>The Republican candidate, campaigning at a windows manufacturing plant in Johnstown today, said ''there is much more work to do'' to improve the economy.</p>
        <p>He added, ''Having said that, compared to where the upstate economy was in the late 80's and early 90's, which were years of high taxes, job loss, factories moving out of the state, I believe the upstate economy has turned the corner.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman, Bryan Flood, said, ''Mrs. Clinton would like to engage in a monthlong argument over whether the glass is half empty or half full, and whether the upstate is mostly cloudy and partly sunny.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, she's trying to detract from the fact that she has no real plan to create jobs, despite a $4 trillion surplus.''</p>
        <p>The question of the upstate economy has put Mr. Lazio in a difficult position because of his close allegiance with Gov. George E. Pataki, his biggest political ally.</p>
        <p>Any criticism that Mr. Lazio might offer of the economy could well be seized by Democrats as an attack on Mr. Pataki's stewardship and could anger Mr. Pataki and his political advisers. The governor is up for re-election in 2002, and his aides say that as of now, he is likely to seek re-election.</p>
        <p>Although much of the news coverage of the debate, particularly downstate, has focused on Mr. Lazio's challenge to Mrs. Clinton that she sign a pledge agreeing to a ban on soft money, the candidate's position on the economy has drawn considerable attention in upstate newspapers.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Lazio first made the comment at the debate, one of the panelists, Bob McCarthy, the political reporter for The Buffalo News, reacted with surprise, saying, ''How do you address the fact that 45,000 people have left Erie County in the past 10 years?''</p>
        <p>And on Tuesday, in a story in The Buffalo News, Joel A. Giambra, the Erie County executive and a Republican, offered a decidedly less cheery view of the economic state of affairs.</p>
        <p>''Yes, we're starting to see the end of the bottoming out and the beginning of some hopeful signs, but we're not out of the woods,'' he told the newspaper. ''What's happened are not laurels to rest on.''</p>
        <p>Since the debate, Mr. Lazio has campaigned heavily in upstate New York, talking about his tax cut plan and visiting parts of New York that highlight economic development.</p>
        <p>''I believe we have a plan for the upstate economy,'' Mr. Lazio said on Tuesday in Rochester, where he visited the Rochester Institute of Technology. ''It focuses on lowering taxes, addressing broad-band access, job creation in rural areas.''</p>
        <p>The issue of the upstate economy is not an entirely easy matter for Mrs. Clinton to raise either, because, aides said, she needs to avoid coming across as the outsider putting down a troubled part of New York.</p>
        <p>To that end, Mrs. Clinton was given some political cover at her speech today by the Democratic mayor of Buffalo, Anthony Masiello. In introducing Mrs. Clinton, he said that Mr. Lazio's statement showed a ''profound misunderstanding of upstate New York'' but added that he believed ''we are on the cusp of an economic revival.''</p>
        <p>The first lady offered a string of statistics intended to rebut an absent Mr. Lazio. (Organizers of the luncheon said that he was invited to attend as well but declined.)</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton reiterated her call for tax credits for job creation, job training centers and grants to encourage high-tech development.</p>
        <p>''There are very big differences between my opponent and myself,'' she said. ''I believe upstate New York needs targeted economic help to catch up with the rest of the state and the nation, and my opponent believes that no such special help is called for.''</p>
