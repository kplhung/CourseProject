        <p>The Islanders trimmed their training camp roster from 35 to 26 players yesterday, with the 20-year-old defenseman Mathieu Biron leading the exodus to the minors.</p>
        <p>Biron, who played 60 games last season after just two seasons in juniors, was assigned to the Lowell Lock Monsters of the American Hockey League, along with defensemen Bransilav Mezei and Ray Schultz, and forwards Juraj Kolnick and Jason Krog.</p>
        <p>''We rushed Matty last year,'' General Manager Mike Milbury said. ''Having Kevin Haller, Roman Hamrlik and Garry Galley has given us the luxury of giving these guys some time. There's no sense in having a 20-year-old kid sitting here not playing when he should be playing.''</p>
        <p>Goalie Stephen Valiquette and Anders Myrvold, a defenseman, were also sent to Springfield of the A.H.L., and forwards Jesse Belanger and Mark Lawrence were assigned to the Chicago Wolves of the International Hockey League.</p>
        <p>The moves left three goalies, eight defensemen and 15 forwards in training camp, with Aris Brimanis and Yevgeny Korolev battling for the seventh defensive spot and Jeff Toms and Mark Petrovicky vying to be one of the remaining forwards.</p>
