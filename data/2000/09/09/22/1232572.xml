        <p>The three young women carrying their books to class don't look as if they belong in any high school on earth, which is good. They fit perfectly in the fun house world of a soap opera, which is exactly what we are watching them film. As the camera rolls on the fictional soap ''Grosse Pointe'' -- the show within a show on the amusing WB comedy also called ''Grosse Pointe'' -- the actresses walk side by side down a corridor.</p>
        <p>On the right is the star, Hunter, in overdone makeup and enormous designer earrings, looking like a refugee from a Vogue fashion layout. In the center is Courtney, her trashy cousin from West Virginia, whose long blond hair and tiny cut-off jeans seem inspired by Elly May on ''The Beverly Hillbillies.'' Next to Courtney is Marcy, a pathetic, trembling creature who has eating disorder written all over her emaciated body and who mysteriously finds herself scrunched against the lockers as she walks. As soon as the camera stops, Marcy blames Courtney for pushing her, but we know that the backstabbing Hunter can elbow the competition off screen even from a distance.</p>

In the center is Courtney, her trashy cousin from West Virginia, whose long blond hair and tiny cut-off jeans seem inspired by Elly May on ''The Beverly Hillbillies.''

        <p>A wicked and clever satire of show business, ''Grosse Pointe'' spends most of its time peering behind the scenes of the soap to reveal which young heartthrob wears a wig to conceal his seriously receding hairline. In this universe the hair and makeup people are all-knowing and all-powerful.</p>
        <p>Soap operas are easy targets of course, already halfway to satire. This spoof works because of its viciously sharp insiders' eye. The show was created by Darren Star, who also created ''Sex and the City'' and ''Melrose Place.'' Most meaningfully here, he was an executive producer of ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' the teen soap that ''Grosse Pointe'' so mercilessly sends up.</p>
        <p>Though the satire could be directed at any puffed-up celebrity, it helps to have the key to the ''90210'' references. The endlessly difficult and egotistical Hunter (Irene Molloy), who plays Becky on the soap, makes fun of the off-camera reputation of Shannen Doherty, who was Brenda on ''90210.'' Johnny (Al Santos) is the good-looking, dimwitted actor who plays Becky's brother, Brad; on ''90210,'' the brother's name was Brandon, played by Jason Priestly. Quentin (Kohl Sudduth) plays Becky's current boyfriend, Stone (the Luke Perry role).</p>
        <p>The show begins with a scene from the soap, in which Becky and Stone are in a car crash. At the hospital Becky's mother learns her daughter was pregnant but has lost the baby. ''I'm so sorry, Mom,'' Hunter-as-Becky says in tearful melodrama mode. ''I lose everything.''</p>
        <p>Marcy (Lindsay Sloane) was even more conspicuously Tori Spelling in the original version of the ''Grosse Pointe'' pilot, in which she was the niece of the show's producer. But after Aaron Spelling, who produced ''90210,'' reportedly complained about the blunt reference to his daughter, the relationship was deleted. Marcy still has no right being in show business. An Entertainment Weekly poll has placed her popularity below that of a minor character on MTV's cartoon ''Daria.'' She handles this by driving to work repeating ''I love myself, I only eat healthy food,'' then stuffing a chocolate cupcake in her mouth.</p>
        <p>''Grosse Pointe'' has a terrible time period, sandwiched between ''Sabrina'' and ''Popular,'' two shows aimed at pre-teenage girls, probably not the largest audience for show-biz satire. But it's nice of Mr. Star to acknowledge the vacuousness of what he has done before.</p>
        <p>He can afford to, now that he is becoming a brand-name producer, like David E. Kelley or Steven Bochco. His ''Sex and the City'' goes beyond soap to analyze social manners; his promising and even newer show, ''The Street'' (on Fox beginning Nov. 1), is pure melodrama, set on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>''Grosse Pointe'' is simply fun, taking shrewd advantage of the hunger for behind-the-scenes exposes. There's a lot to be said for a series goofy enough to call a character Dave the Stand-In.</p>
        <p>SWEET REVENGE  Showtime, Sunday night at 8</p>
        <p>There is nothing flatter than a farce with no sense of timing. As Sam Neill, Kristin Scott Thomas and Helena Bonham Carter struggle through this lethargic, misguided attempt at comedy, it is possible to see what it should have been. The 90-minute film is based on Alan Ayckbourn's two linked plays called ''Revengers' Comedies,'' which together ran for five hours and received spectacular praise when they were staged in England in 1989. Somehow that work has morphed into ''Sweet Revenge,'' written and directed by Malcolm Mowbray (who has never again been as sharp as he was in directing ''A Private Function'').</p>
        <p>Ms. Bonham Carter plays the rich, eccentric Karen, who is about to throw herself off a bridge because her married lover has gone back to his fox-hunting wife. The wife's name is a satire in itself: Imogen Staxton-Billing (Ms. Scott Thomas). Karen is rescued by Henry Bell (Mr. Neill), about to commit suicide himself because he has lost his wife and been fired from his middle-management job. They decide to destroy each other's enemies, which critics of the Ayckbourn plays quickly saw as a homage to Hitchcock's ''Strangers on a Train,'' but which seems like unimaginative theft here.</p>
        <p>Scenes that should have been played with furious wit are labored. Lured to Karen's huge estate, Henry is given borrowed clothes from the 70's, which forces Mr. Neill to parade around in a frilly green shirt and bright blue pants. Worse, a clumsy servant drops a greasy kipper in his lap at breakfast, which means hounds sniff at his crotch for what seems an endless amount of screen time. Mr. Neill and Ms. Scott Thomas somehow keep their dignity. But Ms. Bonham Carter puts on a frumpy disguise, including a bad curly wig and fake teeth, when she sets out to thwart Henry's former boss. Her annoying performance suggests she should continue playing cool aristocrats and leave comedy alone.</p>
        <p>Rupert Graves, as Karen's equally eccentric brother, rides a motorcycle in the halls of their house, which is meant to make everything seem zany. If only that were true. ''Sweet Revenge'' was made in 1997 for the BBC and backed by Miramax; it's easy to see why Miramax dumped this curiosity straight to cable.</p>
        <p>GROSSE POINTE  WB network, tonight at 8:30  (Channel 11 in New York)</p>
        <p>Created by Darren Star; Amy Engelberg, Wendy Engelberg and Will Gluck, producers; Dennis Erdman and Andrew Fleming, consulting producers; Rob Lollerstein and Ellen Idelson, supervising producers; David Knoller, co-executive producer.

        <p>WITH: Kyle Howard (Dave May), Irene Molloy (Hunter Fallow), William Ragsdale (Rob Fields), Al Santos (Johnny Bishop), Lindsay Sloane (Marcy Sternfeld), Bonnie Somerville (Courtney Scott), Kohl Sudduth (Quentin King) and Joely Fisher (Hope Lustig).</p>
