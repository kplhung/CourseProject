        <p>A 72-year-old retired paralegal who is suffering from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair yesterday shot and wounded a 67-year-old lawyer for whom he once worked, the police said, calling the incident a dispute over money.</p>
        <p>The lawyer, Bernard Harrison, 67, suffered a gunshot wound to his right leg after he and his former paralegal argued in his law office at 185 Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights, the police said. Mr. Harrison was taken to St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center of New York where he was listed in stable condition.</p>
        <p>The suspect in the shooting, Howard Schwartz, was taken to Long Island College Hospital suffering from chest pains after the 1 p.m. incident, the police said. He was later reported in stable condition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz was driven to the lawyer's office by his home health aide, who was unable to park on Montague Street, the police said. So Mr. Schwartz told the aide to return and pick him up in 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>A security guard at the Municipal Credit Union, which is next door to the office building where the law office is located, said he held the door open for Mr. Schwartz, who uses a motorized wheelchair, and pushed the button in the elevator for Mr. Harrison's third-floor office.</p>
        <p>The guard, Milton Marchi, said Mr. Schwartz ''was angry, aggressive, like he wanted to take care of something. He had something wrapped up in his hand. I guess it was a gun.''</p>
        <p>Witnesses heard the two men arguing and then heard a gunshot, the police said. Mr. Schwartz apparently fired twice, first missing the lawyer and then hitting him in the leg with the second shot.</p>
        <p>Other office workers who heard the argument called the police. Mr. Schwartz did not struggle with the officers who responded.</p>
        <p>The .38-caliber revolver that investigators believe was used in the shooting was recovered.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harrison, who was admitted to the bar in 1985 and practices personal injury law, told the officers that his assailant had said something about a debt from three years ago, the police said. Mr. Schwartz had worked for the lawyer for about eight years, leaving about two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz, who lives in North Babylon, N.Y., was charged with attempted murder, first-degree assault and criminal possession of a weapon, said Sgt. Richard LaPera of the 84th Precinct Detective Squad.</p>
