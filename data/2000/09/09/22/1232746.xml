        <p>While the history of modern architecture boasts many socially ameliorative schemes, in practice custom architectural design and real social deprivation rarely meet. An exception, to which this exhibition is devoted, is Samuel Mockbee's Rural Studio, a university-sponsored enterprise that has produced singular homes and amenities for deeply impoverished citizens of a small rural enclave along the Black Warrior River in Hale County, Alabama.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mockbee, an architect and professor at Auburn University in Alabama, along with his colleague D. K. Ruth, founded the Rural Studio in 1993 to give architecture students the opportunity to design and build architecturally interesting houses. Because the homes are free to residents (who are consulted in the design process), costs have to be kept low. This is accomplished by using some outside money and lots of unpaid student labor and by inventively recycling salvaged materials.</p>
        <p>As proved by models and photographs (supplemented by many of Mr. Mockbee's gestural sketches and two of his vibrant, mythic paintings), the Rural Studio's work has aesthetic merit. The Bryant house, with a transparent corrugated plastic screen overhanging a wide porch, its small, barrel-vaulted bedrooms in the rear and walls of stucco-coated hay bales, cost only $16,500; but its generous, slightly funky vernacular look is far from what one has come to expect from institutionally cranked out, low-income housing.</p>
        <p>The Rural Studio's achievement is ultimately more social and educational than artistic. Mr. Mockbee, who recently received a MacArthur Foundation ''genius grant,'' has made an inspirational case for the democratization of fine architecture.</p>
