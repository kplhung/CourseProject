        <p>A homeless man who had been released this week from Rikers Island was arrested yesterday after he asked a woman for directions on the Upper East Side, then stabbed her, knocked her on the head and took her purse, the police said.</p>
        <p>The victim, Lee Den Hond, 30, was returning home at 1:30 a.m. after her first night as a hostess at Serafina,  an Italian restaurant downtown on Lafayette Street. As she left the subway station at 86th Street and headed toward her apartment, the police said, the man approached her at 89th Street and Madison Avenue.</p>
        <p>After the attack, police officers  spotted Angel Pallo, 30, near the corner of 90th Street and Fifth Avenue. They recovered a folding knife and Ms. Den Hond's purse, arrested Mr. Pallo and charged him with robbery and assault. Ms. Den Hond, who had been stabbed near the shoulder, was taken to New York Weill Cornell Center and released in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>A neighbor, Samir Billan, said he was in the kitchen of his East 89th Street apartment when he heard two shrieks on the street. He said he ran to the window of his ninth-floor apartment and saw a woman take two or three steps forward before collapsing on the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>''I've lived there many years,'' Mr. Billan said. ''I never did see something like this. It's a very good location.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pallo has a criminal record dating back to 1988, the police said, and spent about eight years in state prisons and local jails, the authorities said yesterday. He was charged  with first-degree robbery in 1992 and convicted, said Tom Grant, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Parole. In that incident, Mr. Pallo had displayed what appeared to be a pistol and robbed a woman, Mr. Grant said, and in September of that year he ripped a chain from the neck of a woman on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>The Parole Board rejected three requests for parole from Mr. Pallo. A year ago, Mr. Grant said, it declared that his release would be ''incompatible with the welfare and safety of the community.''</p>
        <p>In January, despite the board's recommendation, Mr. Grant said, the state corrections department conditionally released Mr. Pallo, after taking eight months off his sentence for good behavior under state laws that have since been changed.</p>
        <p>But in April Mr. Pallo was taken to Rikers Island after he hit his 7-year-old son, causing his face to swell, and then denied the incident to his parole officer, the authorities said. He was released on Monday after serving the remainder of his sentence.</p>
