        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: VALLONE FAULTS PARKS POLICY -- The City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, charged yesterday that a Parks Department policy of asking for large donations from groups that used city parks was illegal, and said that the department ''must not hold the city's resources hostage for payment.'' Mr. Vallone criticized a request for a $20,000 donation made to the organizers of a new Catholic museum, who have applied to use an East Harlem park next week for a fund-raiser. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended the policy, saying it had been applied uniformly for years to help finance park improvements.</p>

        <p>HUNTINGTON: WARNING OF FUEL PRICE RISE -- Richard M. Kessel, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, said yesterday that the rising price of oil and natural gas could force the authority to charge customers more for fuel next year. Mr. Kessel said that with oil prices approaching $40 a barrel, the company has exceeded its fuel budget by more than $200 million this year. Mr. Kessel urged the Clinton administration to release crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help keep prices stabilized.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: ARRAIGNMENTS IN SMUGGLING CASE -- Robert E. Porges, a leading immigration lawyer, along with his wife and five current and former employees, pleaded not guilty yesterday to racketeering and immigrant-smuggling charges during an arraignment in Federal District Court in Manhattan. A grand jury indictment unsealed on Wednesday described Mr. Porges's law firm as a racketeering enterprise that aided and profited from the smuggling of illegal Chinese immigrants. Prosecutors also accused Mr. Porges, 62, of helping immigrants prepare fraudulent claims for political asylum, and his wife, Sheery Lu Porges, 47, of helping smugglers abduct immigrants who owed them the price of their passage to the United States.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: COMMUNITY GARDENS LAWSUIT -- Supporters of community gardens filed a lawsuit yesterday trying to force New York City to submit hundreds of gardens to a lengthy land-review process before they can be leveled and the land converted to other uses. The lawsuit, in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, charges that the city must abide by the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, including public hearings, before selling or disposing of more than 600 community gardens on public land. Green Guerrillas, which filed the suit, wants gardeners and community groups to have more say in how the garden sites are used. But city officials said they submitted gardens for land review only if a development was already proposed.</p>

        <p>WOODBRIDGE: TEMPORARY SEX-OFFENDER UNIT -- New Jersey officials, citing a Wednesday court ruling, began erecting fencing for a temporary treatment unit for 115 civilly committed sex offenders at East Jersey State Prison in Woodbridge. Opponents of the plan said they would decide by next week whether to appeal the ruling. They contend that the state plan is a ruse to place a permanent center there for sex offenders who have completed their sentences but are too violent to release. A spokesman for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said she was expected to pick a permanent site either at East Jersey or at Southwoods State Prison in Maurice River in Cumberland County.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: WHITMAN VETOES OFF-TRACK BETTING -- Gov. Christine Todd Whitman yesterday vetoed a bill that would have allowed racetrack owners, including the state sports authority, to open as many as 15 off-track betting parlors around the state. The bill would also have allowed gamblers to set up accounts at racetracks so they could bet by phone or Internet. The sports authority, which operates the Meadowlands and Monmouth Park racetracks, were backers of the proposal. The governor said she supported off-track betting but wanted measures requiring more efficient operation of O.T.B. parlors.</p>

        <p>PATERSON: EX-OFFICIAL PLEADS GUILTY -- The former Passaic County business administrator is the latest official to plead guilty to federal corruption charges in an investigation of contract grants by the county government. The former administrator, Nicola DiDonna, pleaded guilty Wednesday to two counts of conspiring to commit mail fraud, admitting that between 1993 and 1997 he agreed to award contracts to certain firms in exchange for payments to himself and other people, the United States attorney's office in Newark said. Mr. DiDonna admitted that he awarded more than $400,000 a year in contracts that did not require public bidding, in exchange for more than $65,000.</p>

        <p>JERSEY CITY: TROOPER IN CRITICAL CONDITION -- A state trooper was in critical condition last night with internal injuries and a shattered leg, after he and a drunken-driving suspect he was chasing at night on foot ran off a turnpike ramp and fell 32 feet. The trooper, Thomas Ryan, and his partner responded to a call at 11:56 p.m. Wednesday about a car that was traveling on the wrong side of the road, said Sgt. Al Della Fave, a state police spokesman. He said the suspect, Thomas J. Morris, 50, got out of his car and fled. Mr. Morris, who is charged with drunken driving and other offenses, was in stable condition at Jersey City Medical Center.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: JUDGE TO DECIDE ON TRIBE -- In an effort to speed a decision on two lawsuits filed by the Schaghticoke Indian tribe, Senior Judge Peter C. Dorsey of Federal District Court has said he will determine whether the tribe should receive federal recognition. In his decision, Judge Dorsey wrote that the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs had demonstrated an ''inability to make such determinations in anything remotely resembling a timely manner.'' The Schaghticokes are involved in two lawsuits: one a dispute over the Appalachian Trail, the other involving tribal allegations that Schaghticoke land was sold illegally by state officials.</p>

        <p>HAMDEN: GORE AHEAD IN STATE POLL -- Vice President Al Gore, benefiting from his selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate, leads Gov. George W. Bush by 52 to 33 percent, according to a poll released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University. The poll, which has a three percentage point margin of error, contrasts with a July poll that showed the candidates in a statistical tie. In this latest poll, two-thirds of voters interviewed said the choice of Mr. Lieberman made them think more favorably of Mr. Gore.</p>
