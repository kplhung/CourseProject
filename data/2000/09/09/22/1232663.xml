        <p>Despite recent signs of a diplomatic warming on the Korean peninsula, a new Pentagon report has concluded that North Korea remains a dangerous military threat, pouring its limited resources into a buildup of conventional forces and the development of short- and long-range missiles.</p>
        <p>The report, required by Congress and sent there last week, offers a far more pessimistic assessment of North Korea than many Clinton administration officials have expressed since the summit meeting between the North and South Korean leaders in June.</p>
        <p>Even as the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, has pursued a string of diplomatic initiatives, the Pentagon's report warns that the North Korean Army has deployed ''large numbers'' of rocket launchers and artillery batteries along the demilitarized zone between the North and the South.</p>
        <p>North Korea has also stockpiled chemical weapons and has continued developing its missiles, though it has honored its pledge to American negotiators last year that it would not test them, the report says. That finding echoes a broader intelligence report completed last summer that warned that North Korea's ballistic missiles remained a threat to the United States.</p>
        <p>''While the historic summit between the North and the South holds the promise of reconciliation and change, no evidence exists of the fundamental precursors for change,'' said the report, which has not made public. ''There is little or no evidence of economic reform or reform-minded leaders, reduction in military, or a lessening of anti-U.S. rhetoric.''</p>
        <p>Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, visiting South Korea today, appeared to underscore many of the report's findings. ''North Korea's chemical, biological, nuclear and long-range missile programs continue to pose a threat to South Korea, the U.S. and other countries,'' he said at a news conference.</p>
        <p>After meeting with South Korea's defense minister, Cho Sung Tee, Mr. Cohen said North Korea needed to take concrete steps to reduce tensions -- something American officials have said would include reducing the troops and weapons along the demilitarized zone. He added that the roughly 37,000 American troops stationed in South Korea would remain ''for the indefinite future.''</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and other senior administration officials have voiced strong support for the Korean diplomatic efforts. American officials have stepped up their own talks with the North Koreans, including a new round set to begin in New York City next week that will focus on the North's missile programs, its weapons sales and what the United States believes is its support for terrorism.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's report reflects a far more skeptical view in the administration about the motives behind Mr. Kim's surprising opening. The report said it was not yet clear whether the North Korean leader was truly committed to a peaceful resolution along what is called the last front of the cold war.</p>
        <p>The report -- written by American commanders in South Korea, defense intelligence officials and policymakers at the Pentagon and signed by Mr. Cohen -- says that in the last year North Korea's military has continued ''to grow in both conventional and asymmetrical forces,'' meaning nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as the missiles to launch them.</p>
        <p>The pessimism on North Korea's missile programs reflected a similar conclusion reached by a broad review by American intelligence agencies earlier this year when President Clinton was considering whether to move ahead with a limited national missile defense. Mr. Clinton postponed a decision last month but warned that the missile threat from countries like North Korea was real and growing.</p>
        <p>The report says North Korea has more than 500 shorter-range Scud missiles and continues to make and field No Dong missiles able to strike American forces based in Japan. The report also warns that North Korea has ''produced munition stockpiles of several types of chemical agents'' and has the ability to produce biological weapons, using anthrax, smallpox and bacteria that cause cholera and the plague.</p>
        <p>Despite economic hardships that have ravaged North Korea for the last 10 years, the report says, the government has allocated ''precious resources'' to its military forces, buying new fighter aircraft, making improvements in defenses and conducting its largest winter training exercises ever.</p>
        <p>North Korea ''maintains a dogged adherence to a 'military first' policy even against the backdrop of a nation facing severe economic and social challenges,'' it concludes.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's report acknowledges the North-South summit meeting and other diplomatic advances, as well as divisions among American experts about their significance.</p>
        <p>One military officer who closely follows North Korea said today that the Pentagon was underestimating the potential for a breakthrough and resisting changes in its forces in South Korea that could ease tensions further. ''The U.S., in my opinion, is obsessed with the status quo,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the report's overriding conclusion is that diplomacy has so far done little to alter the perceived threat. Economic and internal security problems, as well as ''the specter of continued brinkmanship'' by North Korean leaders, it says, ''could contribute to regional instability and result in renewed military aggression by the North.''</p>
