        <p>Glen Rice made the cathartic trip cross country, leaving behind baggage in Los Angeles and taking his championship ring with him. He was introduced at Madison Square Garden, a place he has always considered his second home, basking in the warm welcome even as the Knicks were rolling up the red carpet in the wake of Patrick Ewing's departure.</p>
        <p>Just as Ewing stewed this summer, asking the Knicks for a trade and then seeing it explode before it was repackaged into the 12-player deal completed yesterday, Rice, the free agent from the Los Angeles Lakers, fretted about his future. But now he will also switch coasts to pursue a new start.</p>
        <p>''Things in L.A., I really try to put all that behind me,'' Rice said yesterday. ''It was definitely a long summer, not knowing where I was going to be. Thank goodness it has come to an end for me and my family.''</p>
        <p>The Lakers' general manager, Mitch Kupchak, said from Los Angeles that the team could not have won its National Basketball Association title without Rice making sacrifices in his scoring. But the Lakers did not offer the 6-foot-8-inch small forward a contract.</p>
        <p>Rice was unhappy being the third option behind Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, and he often floundered in Phil Jackson's triangle offense the past two seasons. But the Lakers were also adamant that they would not pay Rice a salary that would force them to pay a luxury tax, especially since their more pressing need was bolstering themselves at power forward.</p>
        <p>''The deal was not a perfect deal for everybody, but I think it came close,'' said Kupchak, whose Lakers got the 6-foot-10 Horace Grant from Seattle in the deal that sent Ewing to the SuperSonics.</p>
        <p>The Knicks will pay Rice $36 million over four years to join a perimeter already populated with the swingmen Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell.</p>
        <p>Rice, 33, a three-time All-Star with Charlotte from 1995 to 1998, was so thrilled to be in New York, he sounded eager to fight for his position in training camp.</p>
        <p>''They never told me I'd be starting,'' he said. ''I can be happy, definitely. I really relish the thought of being on the court at the same time as these guys. This system here is a lot more suitable to my game. The guys here, I've seen the way they play, they're very unselfish.''</p>
        <p>Four seasons ago, Rice was the premier scorer in Charlotte. He arrived there in 1995 via the Alonzo Mourning trade after spending his first six years in Miami. In 1997, Rice scored 26.8 points per game, third best in the league, and was the Most Valuable Player of the All-Star Game.</p>
        <p>In contrast, last year, the sharp-shooter with a career average of 20.2 points had his lowest average, at 15.9 points per game, since his rookie season 10 years earlier, and shot a career-worst 36.7 percent from 3-point range. He scored no more than 11 points in any of the first five games of the N.B.A. finals.</p>
        <p>Rice groused about playing time, but his wife was much more vocal. After Game 3 of the finals, when Rice played just 27 minutes despite Bryant being injured, Christina Fernandez publicly chastised Jackson for not playing her husband more. She implied that Jackson held a grudge against Rice.</p>
        <p>''He's my husband, and I don't regret what I said,'' Fernandez said yesterday. She was also happy to start over, looking to move their three children to Westchester.</p>
        <p>Rice sees New York as the cap to his career and feels that even if he is confronted with a lack of playing time again, he will be able to handle it better now.</p>
        <p>''Through my experience in L.A., I matured a great deal,'' he said. ''I realized what it takes to have a championship team. To be able to do the things to get to the next level, guys got to sacrifice.''</p>
        <p>Rice was set to sign a $7.5 million one-year contract with the Chicago Bulls Wednesday -- the Bulls had even planned a news conference -- until the four-team deal was completed, and Rice was relieved. ''This has been a dream of mine,'' Rice said. ''I've always wanted to play in the Garden on a regular basis.''</p>
        <p>The feeling is mutual. ''We have tried to get Glen many times in the nine-plus seasons I've been with the Knicks,'' said Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden. ''Through the years, I can't count the number of times I've seen him open on the 3-point line and knowing another game is going the wrong way.''</p>
        <p>But his sparkling offensive talents have often masked his admitted weakness. ''I have said all along that my best defense is my offense,'' Rice said. ''I've never said that I was the best defender in the game. I can get better.''</p>
        <p>As for his playing time alongside Sprewell and Houston, ''I'm not worried about happiness,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ''They understand sacrifice. We'll have to see if it's going to work with all of them on the floor at the same time.''</p>
        <p>As Rice glowed about coming to a place where he feels wanted, he smiled and said, ''I think it's going to work.''</p>
