        <p>There was an ease in the Mets clubhouse before the game here tonight, a relief from having escaped Atlanta with a victory at Turner Field on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>There seemed little concern that the Mets had struggled at Veterans Stadium, too. The three-game sweep by the Braves in Atlanta last September that troubled the Mets so much was followed by a three-game sweep by the Phillies in Philadelphia. This time the Mets have a four-game series here, and while the Mets may have explained away the mystique of the Braves at Turner Field, there was no relief at Veterans Stadium tonight.</p>

        <p>There was an ease in the Mets clubhouse before the game here tonight, a relief from having escaped Atlanta with a victory at Turner Field on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>There seemed little concern that the Mets had struggled at Veterans Stadium, too. The three-game sweep by the Braves in Atlanta last September that troubled the Mets so much was followed by a three-game sweep by the Phillies in Philadelphia. This time the Mets have a four-game series here, and while the Mets may have explained away the mystique of the Braves at Turner Field, there was no relief at Veterans Stadium tonight.</p>
        <p>After falling behind by 5-1, the Mets cut away at the lead, finally tying it on a run-scoring double by Robin Ventura with two out in the ninth inning. But Rick White got no batters out in the Phillies' ninth, and when Pat Burrell singled with the bases loaded, the Mets had lost another one to Philadelphia, 6-5.</p>
        <p>A loss is a loss, whether one-sided or not, and the latest disappointment erased the good vibes of the comeback.</p>
        <p>''For some reason, they turn it up on us,'' Darryl Hamilton said of the lowly Phillies, who have beaten the Mets seven times in 10 games this season. ''We've got to pick it up against them. The incentive is there. These guys almost knocked us out last year and they're trying to do it again this year.''</p>
        <p>Trailing by four runs, the Mets crept back with a pair of runs in the seventh inning and a solo home run by Todd Zeile off the foul pole in left field in the ninth. They tied the score when Lenny Harris reached on a two-out single and was brought home by Ventura's double.</p>
        <p>After Ventura's pinch-hit heroics tied the score, White promptly gave the game back. A leadoff single by Doug Glanville was followed by a double off the left-center wall by Bobby Abreu. Scott Rolen was intentionally walked to load the bases, and with the infield and outfield pulled in, Burrell lined a 2-1 pitch off the base of the wall in left to end the game.</p>
        <p>''The guys came back and battled and tied the game up,'' White said. ''It was my job to come and shut the door down so we could win it in the next inning, and I just didn't do it. There's no excuses about being late in the season or postseason or any pressure. I just didn't make my pitch when I needed to.''</p>
        <p>The loss dropped the Mets four and a half games behind the idle Braves with nine games remaining and allowed the Los Angeles Dodgers, also with a night off, to move five games behind New York in the wild-card race.</p>
        <p>The Phillies beat the Mets in two of three games in New York earlier this month. Before the game, Manager Bobby Valentine pondered why the Mets have as much trouble with the Phillies, who entered the series having been swept by the Pittsburgh Pirates, as they do with the front-running Braves. Valentine struggled for an answer.</p>
        <p>One of the few interesting things remaining in Philadelphia's season is the question of whether Omar Daal (3-19) will avert his 20th loss of the season. Daal's record is easy to explain: he has received little run support this season with the Phillies or the Arizona Diamondbacks, and he brought a 6.45 earned run average into the game.</p>
        <p>Tonight, with Brian Kingman, the last pitcher to lose 20 (he was 8-20 for the Oakland A's in 1980) in attendance, Daal looked dominant. He put the Mets down easily in the first four innings, building a 3-0 lead before Jay Payton lifted a low pitch nearly out of the dirt and over the left-field wall for a fifth-inning home run.</p>
        <p>''We're at the point in the season where it shouldn't take us five, six innings to get going,'' Hamilton said. ''I mean, I understand sometimes it's tough to get hits, but we had a guy on the mound who has been struggling all year. We've just got to find a way to put pressure on him. We kept him in the game. It was great that we found a way to come back, but we still didn't close the deal.''</p>
        <p>Rick Reed surrendered solo home runs to Abreu in the third inning and Travis Lee in the fourth. It was Lee's first home run as a Phillie in 49 games and 155 at-bats.</p>
        <p>When Payton's homer cut the deficit to 3-1, the Phillies answered with two runs in the sixth inning against Reed on a pair of doubles, a walk, and a wild pickoff attempt.</p>
        <p>''We didn't make good swings at Omar Daal and he kept us off balance,'' Reed said. ''I think we pressed a little bit, trying to hit him. I know guys were coming back saying, 'I can't believe I didn't hit that pitch.' I don't think anybody was tired or not up for the game. I think we're just trying a little bit too hard.''</p>
        <p>With Daal safely avoiding the loss, he left the game after six innings. The Mets made some headway against the Phillies' bullpen in the seventh, scoring a pair of runs on a bases-loaded walk to Benny Agbayani and a run-scoring pinch single by Mike Piazza.</p>
        <p>With the lead cut to 5-3, the Mets squandered an opportunity to do more damage when Vicente Padilla struck out Todd Pratt to end the inning, leaving the bases loaded.</p>
        <p>''I think as a team, the last thing we're thinking about is anything past this series, tomorrow's game,'' Piazza said. ''That's all you can do. You can get headaches from trying to figure out what's wrong. I could only speak for myself, but it seemed like everybody was in the game.''</p>
