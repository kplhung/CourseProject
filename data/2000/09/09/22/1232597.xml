        <p>Activities related to literature, from readings of printed novels to panel discussions on computer-generated texts, are to be offered over the next three days during the 22nd New York Is Book Country festival.</p>
        <p>''A Book, E-Book, Any Book'' is the theme of the festival's centerpiece, the fair that takes place on Sunday along Fifth Avenue from 48th to 57th Streets in Manhattan. Emeril Lagasse, the chef and television personality, will serve as grand marshal and will give a cooking demonstration at 2 p.m.</p>
        <p>Authors and illustrators, among them Mary Higgins Clark, will make appearances at the booths where literary material from more than 200 exhibitors, from major publishers to small presses, will be available from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., weather permitting; the fair, which is free, may be canceled if it rains heavily. Information: (212) 207-7242.</p>
        <p>Free maps of the booth sites will be available at an information booth on the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 52d Street. A special feature this year is a New Technology Pavilion, an interactive display sponsored by RCA eBook that will offer a look at innovations in e-book publishing. Special activities will take place at two stages. One, at 53d Street, will feature entertainment for children, including storytelling, music and a performance by young members of the Lee Strasberg children's Actors Troupe.
