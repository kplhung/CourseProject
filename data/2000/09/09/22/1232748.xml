        <p>As this well-selected memorial retrospective proves, Gregory Gillespie, who died this year at 63, was one of a kind.

        <p>Forum Gallery</p>

        <p>Through Sept. 30</p>
        <p>As this well-selected memorial retrospective proves, Gregory Gillespie, who died this year at 63, was one of a kind. He went his own way with much ingenuity and willful eccentricity, urged on by visionary impulses both sacred and profane. The exhibition leaves the impression, however, that Gillespie's hyperactive creativity pulled him in so many directions that his artistic identity never quite jelled.</p>
        <p>Among his most compelling works are miniature pictures painted in Europe in the 1960's in the style of old masters like Bruegel and Bosch: a luminous image of troll-like pedestrians and bicyclists in a narrow street in Madrid, for example. More typical of his mature approach are the large-scale portraits of himself or his wife that combine everything and the kitchen sink: Magic Realism, photocollage, primitivistic symbols, actual objects, materials like plywood, tile and metal, and passages of raw, heaped-up paint, all organized into polytheistic altars to the pluralistic psyche.</p>
        <p>In the end, it appears Gillespie had boiled his multiple personality syndrome down to two possibilities. On the one hand, as in the life-size ''Self-Portrait Triumphant,'' in which the shirtless, paunchy artist raises his arms exultantly like a champion boxer, there is a self-mocking buffoonery akin to that of the funk artist Robert Arneson. On the other, there is an ambitious realism like that of William Beckman, who, as it happens, appears here in a robustly sensitive portrait. Either way, it is sad to see that the potential of this abundantly gifted artist was far from exhausted when his career came to its abrupt end.</p>
