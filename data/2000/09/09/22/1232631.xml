        <p>Orfi, the label produced by Ana Gonzalez, a designer, and Donald Hearn, an architect, is an acronym for Organization for Returning Fashion Interest to the People. It's an odd name, in part because the clothes are sold at places like Barneys New York and Louis Boston, not generally considered the premiere shopping destinations of ''the people,'' and also because regular men and women -- the vast majority who have no answer to the question, ''What's your favorite issue of Visionaire?'' -- probably wouldn't have much use for the team's particular brand of subversion.</p>
        <p>At the Orfi show on Wednesday night, which was held at the Soldiers', Sailors', Marines' and Airmen's Club on Lexington Avenue, guests waited more than an hour to see nine and half minutes' worth of clothes that would be great for anyone who sits at home hoarding canned tuna and living in fear of black helicopters and the New World Order. But in a way none of that really mattered. The designers seemed genuinely excited about the business of making clothes. To see people cheer and throw their fists in the air at a show's finale is as rare a sight during Fashion Week as running into someone with bad teeth.</p>
        <p>''I was so excited to come, I got up at 5 in the morning and made these pants,'' said Amy Takei, a young woman with hair dyed the color of a Twizzler, showing off the leather hip-huggers she was wearing.</p>
        <p>Unlike the usual suspects who fill the tents at Bryant Park twice a year, here were people who looked as if they were exactly where they wanted to be.</p>
        <p>By Thursday, the fifth day of the spring 2001 collections in New York, it was hard not to feel as if passion had become the greatest missing element in the world of big-money American fashion.</p>
        <p>Where was it for example, in Steven Slowik's debut for Bill Blass yesterday? Gone was Mr. Blass's intimate understanding of his clients' love of the good life. Gone was the exceptional tailoring. In an ill-fated attempt at youthfulness, Mr. Slowik played with diagonals in seams, necklines and hemlines. He inexplicibly stuck gold-sequined butterflies on dresses and jackets and a ring of purple stones on a trench coat. When Nina Griscom, a longtime Blass client, was asked what she thought of the collection, she diplomatically responded: ''There wasn't a lot of Bill there. But Steven is going in his own direction.''</p>
        <p>Craig Natiello, a former designer for Mr. Blass, who showed his collection for Halston yesterday, has gone in the direction of Donna Summer. For his audience, it was a painfully long trip. Mr. Natiello seemed compelled to send down the runway every iteration of whatever idea he had. It wasn't enough to show a leopard shirtdress; there had to be a leopard twin set, slip and leopard Ultrasuede suit. When a series of full-length chiffon dresses, all of which looked essentially the same, came out at the end, one editor asked, ''Is the next one going to come out upside down?''</p>
        <p>To some, the Michael Kors show on Wednesday seemed equally repetitious. Indeed, no one needs to take in all the sandstone he offered. But Mr. Kors's collection was a welcome return to the pared-down sportswear that won him so many fans in the first place. Unlike Mr. Kors's last two shows (and his fall collection for Celine), these clothes did not betray an overly campy fascination with the well-to-do. If there was a laugh to be had, it resulted from the fact that Mr. Kors must be the first designer to use music from Christopher Cross and Yes.</p>
        <p>His collection featured longer and wider skirts in eyelet and satin, not the pencil-wide knee-length affairs that have prevailed on runways for seasons. Many models even wore sandals that were flat. There were button-front suede skirts and loose shirtdresses with low-slung belts. His loopy press notes (typical of the genre) indicated that his inspirations were ''desert divas: visions of Martha Graham, Millicent Rogers, Lauren Hutton and Ali McGraw.'' The true source of inspiration seemed to be a desire to make clothes that looked less contrived.</p>
        <p>Anna Sui's show on Wednesday evening might have benefited from the same motivation. At her studio earlier in the week, she talked about what got her juices going for this collection -- inspirations that included the Duchess of Windsor's relationship to Mainbocher, the Tuaregs of the Sahara, and something about the Mudd Club and a renewed interest, among her circle of friends, in New Wave music. What resulted, though, seemed a straight-up parody of New Wave: the Madonna of ''Desperately Seeking Susan.'' There were chopped-up fishnet gloves and dresses that looked randomly cut and tied back together. Ms. Sui's best look was one that veered from any of her themes: a black evening skirt of raffia and beading that would not have looked out of place at an Oscar de la Renta show.</p>
        <p>If passion was to be found in recent days, it was quite literally not on runways. This season, Geoffrey Beene, who has periodically given up catwalk shows, offered a presentation in his 39th Street studio. The complaint about Mr. Beene is that his clothes don't change. Yet, his tireless devotion to the body's geometry indicates he loves what he is doing, without equivocation. Mr. Beene showed his classic slim, cut-out evening gowns that play inventively with seams, and which managed to seem monastic and sexually charged -- no curve of the body was obscured -- at the same time. He also showed full evening skirts topped with lovely roll-neck sweaters, hand knit and trimmed at the sleeve with metal mesh.</p>
        <p>Later in the day, Gregory Parkinson, who showed a small collection on mannequins at the Linda Dresner boutique on Park Avenue, left one with a glimmer of hope for fashion's ability to elicit something close to emotion. He offered a handful of whimsically patterned, buttonless jackets and full skirts a woman would want to wear to see her best childhood girlfriend. They were warm, and Mr. Parkinson dyed the fabrics himself -- in a tub in Brooklyn.</p>
