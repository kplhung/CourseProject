        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that he would strongly oppose a stadium for the New York Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan.

        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that he would strongly oppose a stadium for the New York Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan. Although Mr. Pataki has long been skeptical of moving the team from the Bronx to a new home on the Hudson River, his comments were his most emphatic to date.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's remarks were in response to comments by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who on Wednesday left open the possibility that the Yankees might use a proposed stadium over the West Side rail yards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki did say he would consider a West Side stadium for other uses or teams. ''Let me make it plain, though,'' he added at a news conference at his Manhattan office, ''if the idea is to move the Yankees from the Bronx, I will oppose it strenuously. It cannot be part of any of this proposal.''</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Pataki controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that owns the land, his opposition would effectively stop any move by the Yankees to the West Side.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's press secretary, Sunny Mindel, said that the mayor had no comment on the governor's remarks. Howard J. Rubenstein, the spokesman for the Yankees, also said he had no comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has longed to build a stadium on the West Side, but has been thwarted by intense neighborhood opposition and a lack of support from officials. This year he again proposed that a stadium be used for football, but as part of a larger plan promoted by a group hoping to lure the Olympics to the city in 2012.</p>
        <p>In recent months Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Pataki and officials of the Olympics group, NYC 2012, have been meeting with representatives of the New York Jets, who would like a West Side home. This week, as details of the Jets meetings began to emerge, Mr. Giuliani abruptly said at a news conference that he wanted to build a domed stadium on a site from 30th to 34th Street regardless of whether it was for the Olympics, the Jets, the Yankees or the New York Mets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki said yesterday that he did not specifically support the mayor's desires for a domed arena, but that he was open to the proposals of the local Olympic committee, which are similar to what the mayor is proposing. ''I don't know that it's the mayor's plan,'' said Mr. Pataki, who has a mutually competitive relationship with Mr. Giuliani. ''It's more something that has been advanced by the Olympic committee, and we'll look at it.''</p>
