        <p>It took nearly 300 years to get a Scottish parliament back up and running, but only one year to make people wonder if it was worth the struggle.</p>
        <p>''All right, heads up and pay attention,'' the newspaper The Scotsman said in welcoming the legislators back this month for their second try at proving whether Scots can govern themselves. ''The silly season is officially over. Time now for the totally absurd season to begin.''</p>
        <p>If the political news from the tumultuous first session was bad, the headlines the same day in another paper, The Record, suggested that the summer off had not made things any better: ''Exam Chaos Spreads,'' ''Waiting Lists Soar,'' ''Beleaguered Ministers' Careers Take Turn for the Worse,'' ''Union Chiefs Threaten Autumn of Discontent.''</p>
        <p>The new Parliament -- the first in Scotland since 1707 -- is the fruit of Prime Minister Tony Blair's program known as devolution, which aims to decentralize power in the United Kingdom and give more self-determination to Britons who live here, in Wales, in Northern Ireland and eventually in the regions of England.</p>
        <p>While the new Parliament can weigh in with decisions on issues like agriculture, education and health and housing, Scotland retains ties to the British Parliament, which continues to regulate strategic areas like defense and social security. For that reason, 16 Scots are Peers in the House of Lords and 45 are members of the House of Commons.</p>
        <p>When it first opened, the Scottish Parliament set itself up for a bruising first round, awarding members commemorative medals before they had done anything more substantive than working out their salaries, bonuses, parking spaces and vacation grants. Then it laid out plans for a grand new home in an inaccessible part of Edinburgh that was to cost $75 million by first estimate and $300 million by current ones.</p>
        <p>All of this was gleefully chronicled by Scotland's 21 robustly competitive papers, which turned from a passionate commitment to the idea of devolution to ferocious resentment of the real thing.</p>
        <p>''There is a real schizophrenia in this country,'' said Frank McAveety, the deputy minister for local government. ''The Scottish press lobbied harder than anyone for a parliament, but now that they've got it, they're queuing up to give it a good kicking.''</p>
        <p>The lawmakers found themselves heckled in the streets and sneered at in the newspapers. Billy Connolly, the Scottish comic actor and playwright, dismissed them as ''a wee pretendy parliament.''</p>
        <p>A seemingly innocuous motion to remove a regulation that limits teachers' freedom to discuss homosexuality with students seeking counsel provoked a multimillion-dollar campaign of loudspeaker trucks, pickets and billboards accusing the lawmakers of condoning sexual perversion. When a scandal erupted in the spring over a badly flawed new system of college entrance exams, the Parliament was blamed for letting it happen.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the lawmakers were seen to be neglecting the real problems affecting Scotland -- a feudal landowning system, decrepit housing, an urban drug epidemic, homelessness, an underperforming tourist agency, and inadequate health services for people who live in Britain's harshest climate and are known for eating too much fried fatty food and indulging in too little exercise to work it off.</p>
        <p>The 129 legislators found governing less exhilarating than getting elected.</p>
        <p>''Many ministers couldn't wait to become ministers and get on with things,'' recalled Graham Leicester, director of the Scottish Council Foundation, a public-policy institute. ''But many of them had not been in government before, and they got very frustrated early on when the answer was, 'Well, yes, that's an interesting idea, minister, and here's the timetable for putting it into practice,' and it stretches over months, maybe years. That's not what they were anticipating.</p>
        <p>''Then officials got frustrated with ministers who didn't understand that things take time, and the whole Parliament got frustrated with a pretty heavy agenda.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leicester tracked their feelings in surveys. ''We went to them a year ago while they were still in first flush when hopes were high,'' he said. ''We've been back to them this summer and found that the general feeling is that what was once a calling has now turned into a job -- and a pretty hard and unrewarding one.''</p>
        <p>The public felt cheated, too. A BBC poll found that only 27 percent thought the Parliament's performance was good, while 31 percent found it poor. But in another finding that proponents are pointing to as a lift for the future, 62 percent said they wanted it to have greater powers.</p>
        <p>Lost for the moment, at least, is a once-spirited campaign for full independence. So remote has the idea become now that Alex Salmond, 45, the feisty leader of the Scottish National Party, quit his post this summer after 10 years in office to return to private life.</p>
        <p>A significant part of the National Party once fought devolution as a distraction from the real goal of independence. But now that the Parliament is here, even those separatists who greeted the new Parliament with little enthusiasm have found themselves obliged to support it. They are afraid that its collapse would only benefit people south of the border who believe unruly Scots are incapable of running their dark and brooding land.</p>
        <p>The locals also have to be convinced. ''To win independence for Scotland, we must win Scotland's trust not only in ourselves as the leaders and drivers of that process, but in the idea that Scottish government delivers for the public,'' said John Swinney, a member of the Parliament who is running to succeed Mr. Salmond as the National leader. ''The two go hand in hand.''</p>
        <p>The Parliament can claim credit for becoming a laboratory for Britain to experiment with proportional representation voting, committees with the power to initiate legislation and coalition government. The legislature is run by the Labor and Liberal Democratic parties jointly, with the Nationalists cast in the role of formal opposition.</p>
        <p>In the interests of producing a more consensual debating atmosphere, the chamber itself was built in a horseshoe shape to eliminate the British Parliament-style confrontational rows of opposing legislators braying abuse at each other across a central well. Did this work? ''No,'' Mr. McAveety said. ''We can't seem to take out the gladitorial element.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leicester said that so much effort was put into setting up the Parliament and holding the elections to it that no time was put into structuring the government itself. ''Disillusionment set in early,'' he said, ''but now there is much more interest, and we have people coming in here today and saying, 'You know that stuff you wrote about holistic government and how the existing institutions don't work -- you were right.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. McAveety, 38, a gritty former leader of the Glasgow City Council, thought his less-tested colleagues would profit from their rough first outing.</p>
        <p>''The intensity and occasional brutalism of it was something that they will learn from,'' he said. ''They have become streetwise very quickly, and after being under siege so long, we've got a kind of camaraderie that has built up in this place.''</p>
