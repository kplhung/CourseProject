        <p>Intel Warns That Revenue Will Fall Short of Forecasts  Intel warned that its third-quarter revenue was likely to be below the company's previous expectations, primarily because of weaker demand for the company's microprocessing chips in Europe.</p>
        <p>Intel said it expected revenue for the third quarter to be 3 percent to 5 percent higher than second-quarter revenue of $8.3 billion. Analysts had predicted growth of 12 percent to 15 percent. The news sent Intel's shares down by 20 percent in after-hours trading. [Page C2.]</p>
        <p>Gore Urges Tapping Into Oil Reserve  Vice President Al Gore said that the White House should release a modest amount of oil from government stockpiles to stablize oil prices, a move that Gov. George W. Bush immediately denounced as a political ploy that could endanger national security. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Economists, oil traders, refiners and politicians are divided about whether high prices and low supplies of petroleum constitute a crisis that should be addressed by tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And one big question looms: Would dumping a big supply of oil on the market lower prices? [A18.]</p>
        <p>Goodyear Issues a Profit Warning  Goodyear Tire and Rubber, wrestling with high raw material costs, a weak euro and lower-than-expected sales, said that it was unlikely to post any profit for the third quarter and that it might even lose money. And, assuming conditions do not change, it held out little hope for much better news for the fourth quarter. Investors sent shares of Goodyear down $2.88, to $18.13. [C5.]</p>
        <p>Snacks Star in Children's Books  This fall, parents and teachers can choose from a sudden proliferation of books starring brand-name candies and snacks. The publishers and authors pay a licensing fee to the food companies, which see a novel opportunity to market to toddlers. But not everyone is pleased to see brand-name snacks invading the world of books. Advertising. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Morgan Falls Short of Estimates  Shares of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter fell $6.50, or 6.8 percent, to $89.44, after the securities firm reported third-quarter earnings of $1.25 billion, or $1.09 a diluted share. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.17 a share. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Low-Power Radio Plan Is Revised  The Federal Communications Commission, seeking to win political support for its proposal to issue licenses for hundreds of low-power FM radio stations, has completed new regulations that permit larger stations to raise complaints about any signal interference. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Boss Defends Federal Executive  At Senate hearings, the executive director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation defended the director of insurance operations, who is accused of improperly steering $40 million worth of contracts. [C5.]</p>
        <p>Successor Named at Deutsche Bank  Deutsche Bank appointed a Swiss investment banker to succeed its chief executive, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, who is scheduled to retire in 2002. Josef Ackermann, left, a former chairman of Credit Suisse who jumped to Deutsche Bank in 1996, had been considered a strong contender to succeed Mr. Breuer. But the early announcement was surprising and may reflect a shifting balance of power at Deutsche Bank. [C4.]</p>
        <p>British Airways Ends Merger Talks  British Airways and KLM abandoned their merger talks after months of discussions failed to produce a workable blueprint for what would have been one of the most ambitious airline combinations. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Suicide Highlights Toll of Japan Debt  The suicide of the president of Nippon Credit Bank, which was saved from insolvency earlier this month by a group of investors led by Softbank, has stunned Japan's banking industry. And it has underscored the human misery caused by the burden of bad debt that continues to vex the Japanese financial system. [C4.]</p>
