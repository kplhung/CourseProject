        <p>THUNDER FROM THE EAST  Portrait of a Rising Asia  By Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn  Illustrated. 377 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50.</p>
        <p>The blacktop road was sleek and new. Modern cars and trucks whizzed past clean shops and restaurants, a far cry from the Java countryside he had last visited 10 years before. All the more shocking when  this correspondent for The New York Times, on a trip reporting the 1997 Asian economic crisis, found his way blocked by a procession of young men on motorcycles cheered on by excited villagers, proudly carrying the head of a newly murdered ''sorcerer'' on a pole. The sorcerers, the ninja, were the guilty ones, he was told. Islamic vigilantes had killed them and more would be killed to destroy their magic.</p>
        <p>This story begins the first chapter of a book written by two Times correspondents, Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, describing the turmoil in Asia at the century's end. (The co-authors, who are a married couple, wrote alternate chapters.) I can think of no better way to epitomize the contrasts between modern, often dazzling economies and half-hidden ancient folkways that continue to bubble up throughout the Asian countries. Historical time-change may be the best way to describe the differences between tradition and technology, new education and old religion, emergent nationalisms and top-down globalization.</p>
        <p>Unlike geographical time-change, which is at least marked by watch settings and disturbed circadian rhythms, historical time-change is ever-present and unpredictable. It is the inescapable byproduct of assorted Asian ''miracles'' in which intellectual and economic pressures condensed within decades the modernizations that Europeans and Americans took centuries to achieve.</p>
        <p>In their book, challengingly subtitled ''Portrait of a Rising Asia,'' Ms. WuDunn and Mr. Kristof have taken upon themselves the daunting task of explaining How, Why and What Next. On the whole they have made a good job of it. From regional plans of the International Monetary Fund to local education systems, from war crimes to environmental problems to the changing status of women, they give the reader a handy Baedecker on an increasingly confident continent and on East Asia in particular. They show a good sense of history in sketching Asian backgrounds.</p>
        <p>But most of all this is a reporter's book in the best sense of the word. The pace of the writing is a bit breathless -- taking a quick run barefoot over an entire continent would leave any writer a bit winded. The authors' views of countries and conditions are anchored in their searching interviews with the people who live and work there. These range far and wide. We hear the story of a failed big-time developer in Thailand, a rickshaw owner in Indonesia, a child prostitute in Cambodia, a battered wife in Korea, a computer tycoon and a hard-pressed local factory owner in Japan. What characterizes almost all of the interviewees is their dedication to work and their patience and perseverance in the face of adversity (for this the authors use the classic Japanese term, gaman).</p>
        <p>About the Asian economic crisis of 1997-98 they are very good indeed. They underline three major factors: 1) the lopsided ratio of short-term economic loans against foreign exchange reserves; 2) the neglect of regulatory infrastructures and legal safeguards; and 3) the disastrous self-confidence of Asian tycoons, bankers and governments. They also point out the faults of Western bankers and international organizations -- the I.M.F. in particular -- in not making accurate assessments of the crisis and discounting the hardships of those injured by it.</p>
        <p>I agree thoroughly with their first major argument: the Asian economic crisis was the best thing that could have happened to Asia. It entailed a terrific human cost, but it is also helping to destroy much of the cronyism, protectionism and government regulation that had burdened Asian business. It helped start a political, social and economic revolution and  forced a greater reliance on markets, democracy and the rule of law.</p>
        <p>I have some major problems with their second argument, which is that  partly because of this forced restructuring, Asia is likely to wrench economic, diplomatic and military power from the West over the coming decades. The first problem concerns  geographic reach. Except for some brief sketches of a recently opening India, South Asia goes largely unreported. If we narrow the authors' focus to East and Southeast Asia, the similarities and parallel advances they cite make abundant sense,  bringing closer to fulfillment the early prophecy of the Japanese writer Okakura Tenshin: ''Asia is one.''  Their reports on villagers dying of pollution are sobering. (The environment is one of the bleakest prisms through which to view Asia.) Equally shocking are the interviews of friendly old Japanese veterans about their World War II atrocities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kristof and Ms. WuDunn's economic comparisons tell us much about generally underreported countries like Indonesia and Thailand. I question some of their political and social assumptions. Their analysis of China is wise if equivocal. Their analysis of Japan is something else again. Despite a wealth of reportorial recall, including their own experiences with Japanese schools, and good analyses of the banking system's collapse, their reading of Japan's current society and politics is quite shallow. For one thing they say surprisingly little about the roots of Japan's current malaise: the one-party rule of the Liberal Democratic party -- with the possible exception of the Communist Party of China the most pervasively corrupt and crony-ridden apparatus in the region.</p>
        <p>In fact the disastrous prevalence of dominant single parties -- Indonesia's Golkar and Malaysia's Umno also come to mind -- are as much a regional characteristic as ingrown national bureaucracies.</p>
        <p>For all that they speak of changes over decades, the authors seem to  underrate the political undertow that in so many places threatens to roil the rising tides of progress. Unquestionably Asia's demography will ultimately prevail, but it will be a long time in coming, punctuated by reverses. And economic, diplomatic and military power will rarely come together. Meanwhile, Asia's historical time zones remain very, very far apart.</p>
        <p>Such cavils aside, Mr. Kristof and Ms. WuDunn have given us an impressive and well-researched study of the world's most important area. Their insights are illumined by their good reporting. It will be a long time before I forget the mortally sick Chinese villagers, the riches-to-rags-and-back Thai entrepreneur and the sturdy citizens of Omiya, not to mention the happy motorcyclist holding up the severed head.</p>
