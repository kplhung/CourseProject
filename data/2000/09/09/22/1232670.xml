        <p>PROBABLY better that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has no inkling Dr. Richard G. Stock, who implanted a spoonful of radioactive silver pellets in his prostate last Friday, considers himself an impostor whose white lab coat from Mount Sinai Hospital is part of a very good disguise. The other part is his track record: if he's implanted radioactive seeds once, he's done it a thousand times.</p>
        <p>So why the career confusion?</p>
        <p>''I'm actually like a frustrated artist,'' concedes Dr. Stock, 38, a radiation oncologist who grew up the son of a frustrated artist in Queens. By high school (Bayside High, where Dad taught art), he had heeded his father's warning to pursue a line of work more mainstream than putting paint to canvas. ''I got into science instead of art,'' he says. Translation: he went pre-med at Columbia with a minor in computer science and, drawn to explaining the unexplainable, developed a fascination for cancer even before completing his residency at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in 1991.</p>
        <p>He estimates that since his arrival at Mount Sinai in 1993, where he became acting chairman of the radiation oncology department three years ago, he has done a thousand implants and lost just 10 patients to prostate cancer. Among patients given the mayor's three-part regimen of hormones, implant and follow-up radiation, none have tested positive for the cancer in biopsies after the treatment. The scientist in him likes those odds. And Dr. Stock's psychotherapist spouse, Dana Lerner, has helped with his people skills: he presents a positive bedside manner. No matter what.</p>
        <p>''You've got six months to live? That's something I've never, ever said, even when it's true and I'm pressed; I hate that,'' he says. ''There's always that small percentage of patients that defies the odds, and if I can give a patient the hope that maybe they're in that percentage, well, I know that's what I would want if it was me in their shoes.''</p>
        <p>Besides the empathy, there is, maintains Dr. Stock, an art to the nuclear medicine he practices: the visualization, the computer graphics, the placement of the implant, each as sovereign in its assigned space as the stars in a van Gogh nightscape. Ask him what will happen to the pellets inside the mayor's prostate in the next three months and he waxes more lyrical than clinical: ''They release a star burst of radiation!''</p>
        <p>To him, it is a beautiful sight, and his most famous patient apparently agreed, opting for radioactive implants (call it the nuclear route) rather than surgical removal of the prostate (the more conservative route) after a five-month investigation of both procedures (whose respective practitioners are, Dr. Stock admits, ''kind of at war'').</p>
        <p>''His biggest concern was being cured,'' says Dr. Stock, contending that radiation offers a better chance of retaining virility. He says he would undergo it himself, not that he has ever been checked for prostate cancer. ''I don't even want to know yet,'' he blurts. (The disease is his specialty, but knowing if he has it is something he prefers to defer.) So is the mayor cured? ''There's no guarantees. The goal is to live a normal life and die of something else.''</p>
        <p>THE bearlike doctor (think teddy bear crossed with grizzly; shoe-button eyes offset by gray stubble on the chin) in the jailhouse scrubs (his rumpled green pajamas are stamped ''Property of Mount Sinai Hospital'' at frequent intervals) is, besides being an artsy type, a Democrat. Just one more thing the mayor didn't know. And had he realized that Dr. Stock likes jazz, he might have skipped the Pavarotti and stuck some Coltrane in the operating room boom box for the procedure, in which 90 rice-sized pellets (titanium outside, radioactive Palladium 103 inside) were installed.</p>
        <p>''The music didn't matter. It was pleasant. And his case wasn't particularly difficult,'' notes Dr. Stock, who with Dr. Alexander M. Kirschenbaum, the mayor's urologist, will be at City Hall today to proclaim September Prostate Awareness Month. ''I think he's happy and relieved; you don't go marching in parades if you're miserable.'' (The mayor marched a day after the implant.)</p>
        <p>Dr. Kirschenbaum detected the mayor's condition in April and referred him to Dr. Stock; the urologist says he is biased toward surgery, but not insulted that Mr. Giuliani elected radiation, calling it a close decision. He says, ''Ten years ago I might have been insulted, but as I learn more about this disease, I become more humble.''</p>
        <p>As Dr. Stock consulted with the mayor -- ''I'll talk to anyone about this procedure for as long as it takes; that's why the nurses are always yelling at me'' -- they conversed endlessly about prostate cancer, but regarding politics, it was don't ask, don't tell. So he never got the chance to tell his patient that he hurdled party lines to vote for him.</p>
        <p>''I'm a real city guy, and I think he changed the city. I remember having my car stolen one summer at Columbia, and you felt it wasn't safe to walk anywhere and you were worried all the time because people had gotten mugged and killed on the Morningside Heights campus.''</p>
        <p>When it comes to hospital politics -- and Dr. Stock, who has sat on every committee from Radiation Safety to Radiation Disaster, plays them adroitly -- treating the mayor has not hurt his candidacy for department chairman.</p>
        <p>''My hat's in the ring,'' he says, cheerfully. Daunted by cancer? Not Dr. Stock. None of those primary-care doctor blues for him. ''It didn't interest me to hear about run-of-the-mill aches and pains, but cancer, that was people caught right in the middle of a life crisis, and I felt that's where I wanted to be, where you could make a big difference.''</p>
