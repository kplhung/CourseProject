        <p>David Wells is the relentless suitor and the Yankees are the first love who broke his heart, and when he struck out Glenallen Hill tonight to complete his 20th victory and drive the Yankees deeper into their ominous late-season slump, he lived in the moment.</p>
        <p>Wells (20-6) pumped his fist in front of the mound several times at the close of the 3-1 victory, the way he did at the end of his perfect game two years ago, and as he hugged his Toronto teammates, he waved an appreciative hand to Paul O'Neill and Chuck Knoblauch, who saluted him from the Yankees' dugout.</p>
        <p>And then, with a slightly impish smile beneath his sprout of beard, Wells, who allowed five hits while striking out eight and walking none, suggested the Yankees were a vulnerable team. ''I see a good ball club over there, but they're very beatable,'' he said, to start.</p>
        <p>But he could be accused of stating the obvious. The Yankees held a nine-game lead just eight days ago, and that has been cut in half: Toronto trails by four and a half games. Cleveland wrecked the Yankees and won three of four in Yankee Stadium last weekend before the Blue Jays swept three games from them here.</p>
        <p>That is eight losses in nine games for the Yankees, who have apparently contracted the same virus that has infected the Mets' offense in September. The Yankees are batting .197 in their last nine games, and have been outscored by 60-18 -- half of their runs coming on home runs, meaning they are not bunching any hits together. Tino Martinez is hitless in his last 24 at-bats, the longest such stretch of his career. Scott Brosius has not had a run batted in in 10 games; Jorge Posada has one R.B.I. in his last 15 games.</p>
        <p>''We're going to break out of this thing,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ''We need to generate something, no question.''</p>
        <p>Wells knows all about their travails. The Yankees were his favorite team before he signed with them, he made his name with them, and he has followed them closely since they traded him in the Roger Clemens deal 19 months ago. The Yankees, Wells said, are ''not as stellar as they were from '96 to '99.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''This year, there have been a lot of changes, a lot of situations over there. They're still in first place, still a great team, but they can be beat.</p>
        <p>''When we put a dent in them like we did tonight, it shows the other teams that they can be beat -- as long as you go out there and play aggressively, play like they do. The heck with the wild card, let's go for the American League East. That's what I'm looking at.''</p>
        <p>Wells wanted to pitch this game so badly, and almost did not. He arrived at Skydome on Tuesday in great pain, his right big toe besieged by gout. He called David Cone from the Toronto clubhouse and reported that he could hardly walk. Cone knew better, saying: ''It seems like he always goes nine after some ailment.''</p>
        <p>Wells felt much better, however, on Wednesday. His first pitch tonight was a crisp 91-mile-an-hour fastball, and within a couple of batters it was evident that Wells had extraordinary stuff. Later, he acknowledged his stuff was as good as it was when he threw the perfect game -- the snaking curveball, the blistering fastball, the great control.</p>
        <p>Wells threw 120 pitches in the perfect game, an average of about 13 pitches per inning. He whizzed through the first four innings with only 40 pitches, an average of 10 per inning. He struck out Posada and David Justice with curveballs to close out the second, and overmatched Jose Canseco to open the third, busting a fastball past him and then carving the strike zone with two curves for a three-pitch strikeout.</p>
        <p>Twelve batters, 12 outs. Wells was so stunning in the first four innings that at least some of the Yankees must have entertained the possibility that The Boomer, still carrying that chip on his shoulder from the trade, might be in the midst of another perfect game.</p>
        <p>Wells blew three fastballs past Hill to start the fifth inning, the 13th consecutive Yankee to be retired. Posada was the 14th Yankees' batter. He has home plate from the perfect game at his home, with a sketch of on the top that shows him and Wells.</p>
        <p>They play against each other now. Wells fooled Posada with a low changeup and all Posada could do was to extend his arms and flick his bat, and he popped the ball into short center field. As Posada rounded first base, Wells grimaced at him. ''They're my brothers over there,'' Wells said later. ''It's tough to leave a team you're close to, but hey, that's the name of the game. Life goes on and even though they're my good friends, they're my enemies.''</p>
        <p>Canseco had an infield hit to push Posada to second, but Martinez popped out to end the Yankees' only serious threat. The Blue Jays had already scored a run against Orlando Hernandez (12-12) by then, and added a couple of more in the bottom of the sixth to lead by 3-0.</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams led off the seventh and slammed a changeup over the center-field wall -- one of perhaps two mistakes Wells made the whole night, Williams noted. The Toronto closer Billy Koch started warming up in the eighth inning, but when the ninth inning began, Wells walked out of the dugout and the crowd cheered.</p>
        <p>Williams grounded to second for the second out, and when Hill waved at that last changeup, Wells bounced off the mound, grinning. He had become the second-oldest player to win 20 games for the first time, at 37 years and 124 days. A Yankee, Allie Reynolds, was the first, at 37 years and 228 days in 1952.</p>
        <p>Wells shook hands with teammates and hugged them. The only way it could have been better for him, said a teammate, is if he could have done it in Yankee Stadium and at the end of the season, when he might return the favor and break hearts in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>If the Yankees keep playing as they have been, Wells might get that chance.</p>
