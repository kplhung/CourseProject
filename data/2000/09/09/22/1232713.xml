        <p>One day after putting an unceremonious end to the Patrick Ewing era in New York, Scott Layden stood at a lectern in Madison Square Garden and praised the future Hall of Fame center and the team's newest star acquisition, Glen Rice.

        <p>One day after putting an unceremonious end to the Patrick Ewing era in New York, Scott Layden stood at a lectern in Madison Square Garden and praised the future Hall of Fame center and the team's newest star acquisition, Glen Rice. Accompanied by the Garden president Dave Checketts, Coach Jeff Van Gundy and Rice, Layden then made an unsolicited and telling comment about the Knicks' new roster.</p>
        <p>''This is the team that we are going to training camp with,'' Layden, the Knicks' general manager, said. ''We feel very good about this team and we're very excited about its prospects.''</p>
        <p>Apparently, Dikembe Mutombo or Chris Webber will not be arriving soon to rescue a feeble Knicks' frontline from being overwhelmed. So, Layden says, the Knicks will begin training camp on Oct. 3 with Luc Longley and Larry Johnson, who averaged fewer than 10 rebounds a game between them last season, as their starters at center and power forward. There is not a doctor in Gotham who could put enough spin on this deal to make it seem as though the Knicks improved themselves in Wednesday's four-team, 12-player trade, so Layden, Checketts and Van Gundy did not bother to try.</p>
        <p>''I don't understand the infatuation with trying to determine today if we're better,'' Van Gundy said tersely. ''That's what the games are for. I think we'll find out. I'm sure some in different cities in the East probably did a happy dance today that Patrick was gone. But it doesn't really matter because it will all come out in the season.''</p>
        <p>Instead of extolling the trade, the Knicks repeatedly said that Ewing felt it was time to make a fresh start after 15 seasons in New York. They said that Ewing jump-started the trade process and, under the circumstances, the Knicks seemed to be saying they were fortunate to get a player of Rice's caliber.</p>
        <p>''This was a situation where we had to make a change,'' said Checketts, who added that the Knicks would retire Ewing's number, 33. ''Change was inevitable. He had requested a trade and out of our respect for him, we honored that request.''</p>
        <p>Now, the Knicks, who are more structurally flawed than they were last season, when Van Gundy first used the term to describe them, appear to be further away from a championship than they have been in nearly a decade. Having blamed poor rebounding for their loss to Indiana in the Eastern Conference finals, they entered the summer determined to improve in that department.</p>
        <p>Yet, Wednesday, they sent away their best rebounder -- and the third-best rebounding center in the league last season, even at age 38, -- for Rice, 33, the malcontent guard Vernon Maxwell (who will very likely be released), the raw Cuban defector Lazaro Borrell, four draft picks and three 7-footers (Longley, Travis Knight and Vladimir Stepania) who combined to average eight rebounds a game last season. Not to mention the oddity of having Latrell Sprewell, Allan Houston and Rice -- each deserving to start and desiring to shoot the ball a lot -- in the same lineup. Hence, the speculation that the Knicks will send Marcus Camby and either Houston or Sprewell to Atlanta for Dikembe Mutombo or to Sacramento for Webber.</p>
        <p>The agent David Falk, who worked tirelessly to get Ewing out of New York and who also represents Rice and Mutombo, the Atlanta center, said such a deal was not likely.</p>
        <p>''Anything is possible,'' Falk said. ''But I think, as this trade proved, it is extremely complex and difficult to make trades involving star players with high salaries. I think probably every team in the league would like to have Dikembe Mutombo, but right now he's an Atlanta Hawk and unless Atlanta makes a decision that they want to trade him, I think it probably is a lot of baseless speculation.''</p>
        <p>The Hawks' general manager, Pete Babcock, reiterated yesterday that the Knicks had not made an offer for Mutombo and that no deal between the two teams was in the works.</p>
        <p>''The players have now changed but the formula for success doesn't change,'' said Van Gundy, who declined to name a starting lineup. ''You win with defense; you win with rebounding; you win with unselfish offense. Those things that go into winning have not changed. We've just changed personnel.''</p>
        <p>And in the process, his team got worse in two of the three ''winning'' categories Van Gundy named, and perhaps all three. While Ewing had certainly declined defensively, he still was more of a presence than Longley, Knight and Johnson put together. And for all his offensive ability, Rice is a notoriously poor defender. Even he admitted as much yesterday.</p>
        <p>''I'm not the best defensive player, but I'm not the worst,'' said Rice, who found it impossible to contain Indiana's Jalen Rose during the N.B.A. finals.</p>
        <p>Rice added: ''I've said all along that my best defense is my offense. I've never said I was the best defender in the game. I can get better.''</p>
        <p>While the new Knicks seem to be built to run, it will be difficult to break if they cannot rebound effectively. Van Gundy, who conceded that the trade weakened the Knicks in what was already their most deficient area, had no answers. His only recourse seems to be to challenge his team's manhood.</p>
        <p>''We're going to try to get the ball,'' Van Gundy said. ''When the ball's in the air on opening night, I'm not going to say, 'Well, we should be bad at this.' We're going to try to rebound the ball as much as we can.''</p>
        <p>While Ewing may have had trouble sharing shots and glory with  Sprewell and Houston, Rice's history with the Los Angeles Lakers has to be at least a little troubling. During the finals, he complained about his lack of shooting opportunities even as Los Angeles marched to the championship. Starting and averaging 15.9 points a game did not seem to be enough for a man who had always been the offensive focal point of his teams. Yesterday, however, Rice, who will be paid $36 million over the next four years, sounded like a changed man, saying that he would be willing to come off the bench if necessary.</p>
        <p>''We do have three guys who are pretty similar in Latrell, Allan and myself,'' he said. ''The thing you can do is go in there and work as hard as possible and realize that if all three of you don't start, one of you will have to sit down. You have to be willing to face that. I'll still be able to get the opportunity to go out and try to do what I can to get this team to the next level, whether I'm coming off the bench or starting.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy said he would look at a big backcourt. With the addition of Rice, the Knicks could post-up Houston against smaller guards and still have an outside shooting threat on the perimeter. But the Knicks must wonder if the ballhandling and decision-making of Houston and Sprewell will be sound enough to allow the up-tempo style the Knicks seem best suited for.</p>
        <p>''It makes a little bit more sense, but getting the ball up the floor is still a worry,'' Van Gundy said. ''And all three of those guys are better when the ball's brought to them than when they're distributing. But we're going to see if it can work.''</p>
