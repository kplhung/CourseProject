        <p>The police have made the first arrest in the scare over the possible tampering of bottled water in the New York region. But rather than arrest someone for tampering, officials said, they charged the suspect with falsely reporting a police incident after he tainted his own water.</p>
        <p>Yesterday evening, the police said that Edwardo Pardo, 31, of Washington Heights, acknowledged that he was trying to garner publicity last Thursday night, when he darted into the bathroom at Frank's Gym, at 4271 Broadway, and poured Clorox bleach into a bottle of Poland Spring water. Mr. Pardo told the authorities he felt a burning sensation in his mouth after drinking from the bottle.</p>

        <p>Inspector Charles Wells, commander of the Police Department's special investigations division, said investigators grew suspicious after hearing several inconsistencies in Mr. Pardo's account. The false reporting charge is a misdemeanor.</p>
