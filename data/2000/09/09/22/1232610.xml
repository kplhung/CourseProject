        <p>Re ''Frustration Grows With Cost of Health Insurance'' (front page, Sept. 18): The inability of the United States, the richest country on earth, to provide health insurance to all its inhabitants is, to the foreign eye,  most puzzling. The first reaction of any European or Canadian is inevitably: Why in the world do you keep such an unfair and inefficient system? Why can't Congress simply extend Medicare to everyone?</p>

        <p>Re ''Frustration Grows With Cost of Health Insurance'' (front page, Sept. 18): The inability of the United States, the richest country on earth, to provide health insurance to all its inhabitants is, to the foreign eye,  most puzzling. The first reaction of any European or Canadian is inevitably: Why in the world do you keep such an unfair and inefficient system? Why can't Congress simply extend Medicare to everyone?</p>
        <p>People would pay for insurance according to their means through income taxes. The instrument of universal coverage is in place. Why not use it?</p>
        <p>JEAN-FRANCOIS BRIERE  Albany, Sept. 18, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is an associate professor of French studies at SUNY-Albany.</p>
