        <p>EVERY athlete at these Olympics has a story. Few have a story like the Olympic boxer Jermain Taylor's. A number of stories all in one: triumph and tragedy, life and loss, coming face to face with the unfairness of it all and, ultimately, claiming victory.</p>
        <p>The most recent chapters in his story began last Friday during the opening ceremony when he stood on the infield with thousands of other Olympic athletes and watched Cathy Freeman light the Olympic flame.</p>

        <p>EVERY athlete at these Olympics has a story. Few have a story like the Olympic boxer Jermain Taylor's. A number of stories all in one: triumph and tragedy, life and loss, coming face to face with the unfairness of it all and, ultimately, claiming victory.</p>
        <p>The most recent chapters in his story began last Friday during the opening ceremony when he stood on the infield with thousands of other Olympic athletes and watched Cathy Freeman light the Olympic flame.</p>
        <p>''As soon as she lit that torch, I knew it was On from there,'' Taylor said. ''I knew this wasn't a regular trip. I got to do a job.''</p>
        <p>The road that carried Taylor from Little Rock, Ark., to Sydney began two years ago. In July 1998, Taylor was in New York competing with the United States boxing team in the Goodwill Games. He won the bronze medal. Then he returned to Little Rock a hero in the eyes of his No. 1 fan, his grandmother Gussie Robinson.</p>
        <p>''I came home, my grandmother said, 'Baby I'm so proud of you,' '' Taylor recalled yesterday. ''She was happy for me, even if I did only win a bronze. For her, just the idea of me doing it. That's my grandmother. I told her then, 'If I make it to the Olympics, I'll make you proud.' ''</p>
        <p>Gussie Robinson had 5 daughters, 3 sons, 18 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. ''She had a special relationship with everybody,'' Taylor said. ''If you need a place to live, you go over to Grandma's house; if you need a place to stay for the night, just go to Grandma's house; if you need somebody to talk to, go to Grandma's. Need to borrow some money, go ask Grandma. She'll give it to you.</p>
        <p>''Grandma was just always there; and she knew everything pretty much. You weren't going to put anything past her.''</p>
        <p>Four months after the bronze medal victory, Taylor's world, his family's world, turned inside out. On Nov. 10, 1998, Taylor's 83-year-old great-grandmother discovered Gussie Robinson's body in bed. She had been murdered. There were no signs of forced entry. The only clue was that her car was missing.</p>
        <p>The family was devastated. As the oldest of five children, Taylor had always taken the emotional lead, beginning when his father left. But this was too much.</p>
        <p>And the nightmare was not over. While the family grieved, the police said the prime suspect in the murder was one of Taylor's uncles, Joe Brown, recently paroled after having served 16 1/2 years of a 35-year term for aggravated robbery and battery.</p>
        <p>Joe Brown lived in a trailer behind Gussie Robinson's yellow house on Wright Avenue. Two days after her death, the family was still paralyzed. Brown, who had changed his name in prison to Ahmad Al-Genius, was named as a suspect.</p>
        <p>Two days later, when the police confronted Al-Genius, he took what the authorities later learned was a bottle of hydrochloric acid and swallowed it. As officers wrestled him down, he blurted out a confession that he had killed his mother. He died on Nov. 18.</p>
        <p>At his grandmother's funeral, Taylor put his Goodwill bronze medal in Gussie Robinson's casket.</p>
        <p>The last two years have been a process of picking up the pieces and focusing on one goal: reaching Sydney.</p>
        <p>''I think it made me a lot stronger,'' Taylor said, '' 'cause every time I step in that ring I think of her. I talk to her: 'Grandma, I'm out here taking care of business. I'm not messing around.' In order to do that I had to keep my head on straight, I knew I had to stay focused on boxing. I had to train harder than I ever trained in my life.''</p>
        <p>In his first Olympic light-middleweight match, on Tuesday, Taylor stopped Bulgaria's Dimitriy Usagin with a stiff right to the head. On Saturday he fights Canada's Scott MacIntosh.</p>
        <p>Tuesday's fight drove home the point to the people back in Little Rock that their favorite son may be building toward something positive. ''I think they're just now starting to realize how big the Olympics really are,'' Taylor said.</p>
        <p>Taylor is but one athlete among thousands with a mission, competing at the highest level against the world's best. But he's still not out of the emotional woods in the aftermath of his family's trauma.</p>
        <p>''When he died, I was like, 'Dang,' he's dead, too,'' Taylor said of Al-Genius. ''He killed himself. That's a heavy thing, to have two people in your family die within the same week. It hits you hard. I didn't know whether I should hate my uncle or I should forgive him, or just go on with my life and not even think about it.</p>
        <p>''I still got one more uncle; he's in jail,'' Taylor continued. ''He and Joe were locked up together. I don't know, as soon as he gets out, if I can face him. I've been thinking about that every day. If he gets out of jail, is he going to be the same.''</p>
        <p>So this is Jermain Taylor, age 22. A young Olympian carrying an Olympic-sized weight in his heart each day he wakes up, each time he steps in the ring.</p>
        <p>Taylor said the violent nature of his grandmother's death no longer matters. All that matters is the loss and the inspiration.</p>
        <p>''It's hard knowing that my grandmother's life was taken,'' he said. ''But I just miss my grandmother. I don't care how she died. I just miss her.''</p>
