        <p>Christina Ray's complex compositions are arrived at by combining subtly toned and tinted photographs with painted surfaces and strips of clear and sandblasted glass. The photographs depict fragments of things committed to movement, like trains, roller coasters, doors and windows, but they also deal with more static elements, like girders, alleys and the facades of old buildings.</p>

        <p>'Stills'</p>
        <p>Radio House Gallery</p>

        <p>Christina Ray's complex compositions are arrived at by combining subtly toned and tinted photographs with painted surfaces and strips of clear and sandblasted glass. The photographs depict fragments of things committed to movement, like trains, roller coasters, doors and windows, but they also deal with more static elements, like girders, alleys and the facades of old buildings.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ray, who refers to her work rather fancily as ''multidimensional sculptural freeze-frames,'' says that she is interested in the collision between ''the elusive, fluid nature of time'' and the technology that attempts to regulate it. But that is hard to read in these images, which fortunately work well without elaboration. In them the fragments -- the photographic ones are laminated to Plexiglas -- play off each other in a delicate counterpoint.</p>
        <p>The compositions are made more intricate by leaning the fragments side by side against the wall on wooden ledges and placing the glass strips in front of them. The disjunctions of the strips and the reflections bouncing off them heighten the ambiguity of the severely cropped images.</p>
        <p>In ''Stills: Velocity 01,''the steel verticals, horizontals and diagonals of a towerlike structure are paired with the circles and humps of a roller coaster. Mysterious recesses in ''Stills: Passage 3,'' formed by a door left ajar and other doors that are only hinted at, are trumped by flat, painted and photographed sections of wall. And in the more ambitious ''Stills: Passage 1,'' the facades, windows and a doorway of an old industrial building form an arresting broken grid of lines, spaces and shadows. It's highly accomplished work.</p>
