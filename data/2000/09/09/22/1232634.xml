        <p>The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, wrestling with high raw material costs, a weak euro and lower-than-expected sales, said yesterday that it was unlikely to post any profit for the third quarter and that it might even lose money. And, assuming conditions do not change, it held out little hope for much better news for the fourth quarter. Until yesterday, analysts had predicted that Goodyear would earn 29 cents a share in the third quarter and 35 cents a share in the fourth.</p>
        <p>Investors reacted negatively to the news, sending Goodyear's shares down $2.88, to $18.13. But few analysts were surprised at the earnings warning. According to First Call/ Thompson Financial, which tracks company earnings, it has been many months since any analyst has rated Goodyear shares any higher than ''hold'' -- a rating that investors generally interpret as a warning to avoid a stock.</p>
        <p>Goodyear had expected to have better news to give. It had expected the euro to be worth 94 cents by now; instead, it is worth only about 86 cents. It had expected oil prices to drop; instead, Goodyear's raw material costs have increased more than 3 percent since June and about 10 percent for the year.</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, lower tire demand caused Goodyear to lower production, a move the company said resulted in manufacturing inefficiencies and higher production costs.</p>
        <p>Goodyear is not suffering alone. Most tire companies are global and are heavily dependent on oil-based chemicals, so all are having their profits squeezed. Slowing automobile production -- exacerbated by the Ford Motor Company's shutdown of several production lines to free up tires to replace 6.5 million Firestone tires that have been recalled -- has hit all of them hard.</p>
        <p>Other industries that are heavily dependent on oil for materials and Detroit for sales are having similar problems. ''We've had a number of chemical companies and auto parts companies warn in recent weeks, so it shouldn't be surprising that Goodyear is having earnings problems,'' said Charles L. Hill, director of research at First Call.</p>
        <p>In April, many tire makers announced price increases and Goodyear raised its prices by 3 percent to 5 percent across the board. But only Cooper Tire and Rubber followed through as well, and by July Goodyear was seeing ''significant volume decreases'' from lost market share, said Keith Price, a Goodyear spokesman. Goodyear never officially rolled back its prices, but it was forced to offer discounts and promotions to bolster sales.</p>
        <p>''Considering the weak euro and high costs, the big surprise was that the tire companies weren't receptive to raising prices,'' said Efraim Levy, a tire analyst with S.&amp; P. Equity Group, who says his estimates for Goodyear's 2001 earnings ''are under review, and the direction they'll probably go is obvious.''</p>
        <p>Goodyear did sell more than a million extra tires this quarter as replacements for recalled Firestone tires. But that is a drop in the revenue bucket for a company that sold 109 million tires -- 71.8 million of them replacement tires -- in North America last year. ''Was there a benefit from the Firestone situation? Yes,'' Mr. Price said. ''But was it enough to offset higher costs and a weaker euro? No.''</p>
        <p>Goodyear does expect to get more share from a clearly weakened Firestone, ''but that's next quarter, or next year,'' Mr. Price said. The company recently imported some high-power marketing talent that may help it gain that share. Robert J. Keegan, a longtime marketer from Procter &amp; Gamble and, most recently, the Eastman Kodak Company, signed on last week as president.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 25, 2000, Monday  An article in Business Day on Friday about a warning from Goodyear Tire and Rubber that it would not meet earnings forecasts cited an incorrect past employer for Robert J. Keegan, the company's new president. He spent most of his career at Eastman Kodak and never worked for Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>
