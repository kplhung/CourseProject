        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Right to Live,'' by David A. Shaywitz (Op-Ed, Sept. 19):</p>
        <p>A few years ago, my father-in-law, in his early 80's, was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital after contracting pneumonia. There, in quick succession, he suffered a heart attack, kidney failure, severe infection and cardiac arrest.</p>
        <p>We were counseled by his attending doctor to let everyone know that, before his admission, he was not ''a sick, old man'' but rather a viable human being who enjoyed life.</p>
        <p>When he left the hospital two months later, under his own power, it was among the happiest moments of his and our lives.</p>
        <p>In the two ensuing years, he golfed, traveled and attended family celebrations. We have never stopped giving thanks.</p>
        <p>Dr. Shaywitz is right: the real skill is not in teaching people how to let go but in discerning who will truly benefit from heroic efforts and who won't.</p>
