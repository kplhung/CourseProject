        <p>With nine days to go before the end of the fiscal year, Congress has made little progress on approving any of the 11 spending bills it must pass to prevent the government from shutting down.</p>
        <p>So far, no one expects a repeat of 1995 when the failure of Congress and President Clinton to agree on the spending measures caused many  agencies to close temporarily. The White House and Congressional leaders have already agreed that Congress will enact and the president will sign stopgap spending bills if necessary to keep the government functioning.</p>
        <p>Still, lawmakers from both parties have noted that the Republican leaders have yet to develop a successful strategy for dealing with the White House on these measures, or even getting Congress to pass them.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the pace has slowed to such an extent that a number of key senators, including Trent Lott, the majority leader, have raised the possibility that Congress may end up in a lame duck session after the November election.</p>
        <p>''We'll be here as long as a takes to get our work done,'' John Czartacki, Mr. Lott's press secretary, said today. ''It's not a pleasant thought, but it may be necessary.''</p>
        <p>Talk of a Congressional session, which is coming from the Senate and not the House, is a far cry from Mr. Lott's predictions earlier this month that he would briskly move the spending bills through his chamber.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott laid out an ambitious agenda under which the Senate would debate the bill to grant permanent normal trade status with China during the day and work on spending bills in the evenings.</p>
        <p>While the senators did debate the China trade bill during the daylight hours, they left around 6 p.m. on most days, declining to take any action on the spending measures.</p>
        <p>As a result, the Senate has not acted on spending measures for the Departments of Commerce, Justice,  State, Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, as well as the Department of the Treasury, which includes the Internal Revenue Service, the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</p>
        <p>Nor have the House and Senate conferees reconciled the different versions of at least three bills that have passed both chambers.</p>
        <p>And negotiations between the White House and Congressional leaders on a mammoth measure to finance the Department of Labor and many health and education programs have been moving slowly.</p>
        <p>Democrats, eager to make the political point that Republicans have been wasting time during their time in power, note that the Senate has been in session 115 days this year, the fewest over a comparable period since 1956.</p>
        <p>''We've only met two more days than the famous 'do-nothing Congress' of 1948,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>Republicans say that the delays in passing bills are the result of stalling tactics by Democrats eager to paint Republicans as malingerers. But whoever is to blame, some lawmakers, especially those in the House who are responsible for passing spending legislation, are becoming frustrated.</p>
        <p>''There is absolutely no reason to have any lame duck session if appropriators are allowed to do what appropriators are supposed to do,'' said Representative C. W. Bill Young, a Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.</p>
        <p>The slow pace stems in part from the political fears of many lawmakers. With the spending bills considered so close to the election, and so loaded with politically explosive issues, legislators become very skittish about voting for them.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, 26 Republicans in the Senate helped defeat a spending bill already approved by the House. It combined financing for the Treasury Department with that for Congress.</p>
        <p>Many Republicans voting against the measure were worried because it contained a $3,800 cost-of-living adjustment in Congressional salaries.</p>
        <p>''Bills could be 98 percent good, and 2 percent bad and people are worried about the bad press they might get for voting for the 2 percent,'' said Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Colorado Republican who is chairman of the Senate subcommittee that drafted the Treasury spending measure. He added, ''Some people around here got spineless real quick.''</p>
        <p>Some students of Congress expect  this year's spending measures will be rolled into one large, comprehensive spending bill, as has been the case in recent years, or into several such bills negotiated between Congressional leaders and the White House.</p>
        <p>''There is no question that we've now gone through a series of budget rounds in which the end product was shaped in negotiations between the White House and the Congressional leadership,'' said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.</p>
        <p>''That's been the pattern, really, since the government shutdown. Even though individual members may feel strongly about particular bills and riders, there is a presumption that, at some point down road, it will be resolved by high-level negotiations. So you get a feeling that a lot of what is done is posturing until the real work gets done.''</p>
