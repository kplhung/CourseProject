        <p>ISRAEL: CONTENTIOUS ROADWAY -- The Jerusalem municipality is starting to expropriate land from Palestinians in southeast Jerusalem to build an eastern road that circumnavigates the congested city. Palestinian officials in East Jerusalem said the project was an obstacle to peace that aimed to separate Palestinian neighborhoods in East Jerusalem from the West Bank, and Israel's Peace Now group called on the city to freeze the roadwork to await the outcome of peace talks.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: AL AKSA PROTEST -- Muslim officials are protesting what they say is Israel's refusal to allow building materials into the Al Aksa Mosque in the contested heart of the Old City. Renovation work has been halted, and if the ban continues, they said, it will ignite Israeli-Arab tensions throughout the region.</p>

        <p>IRAQ: CRITICISM FROM RIGHTS GROUP -- In a letter to Iraq, a leading human rights group criticized the government of Saddam Hussein for refusing to cooperate with the United Nations in making an independent assessment of living conditions in Iraq. The group, Human Rights Watch, also wrote to the Security Council to protest continuing blocks on some Iraqi purchases of equipment under the ''oil for food'' program. Contracts for about $2 billion are being held up, mostly by the United States, according to United Nations officials.</p>

        <p>IRAN: RECALLING A WAR -- Iran remembered the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980 with a military parade in Tehran, calls for a just peace and -- for the first time -- no anti-American slogans. Thousands of veterans of the eight-year war, some in wheelchairs, turbaned clerics, black-robed women who volunteered for militia duty, above, and the Revolutionary Guards paraded before President Mohammad Khatami and top military brass. ''We are seeking to promote peace and detente,'' Mr. Khatami said.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: SETTLERS FACE EVICTION -- The government said it would step up the eviction of illegal black settlers on white-owned farms, aiming at those who occupied land after a government resettlement program started in July. Home Affairs Minister John Nkomo said the cabinet had approved the evictions ''to end corruption and violence in the land redistribution process,'' adding that ''there are too many criminals now on the farms who are inviting people in and selling land to them.''</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: IRISH GROUPS TIED TO BLAST -- The police said the grenade that caused minor damage at the headquarters of M.I.6, the foreign intelligence agency, were fired from a shoulder-borne rocket launcher of the kind used by dissident Irish republican groups. There were no injuries and no damage to the building's interior, but Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, head of Scotland Yard's antiterrorist branch, warned Londoners to be ''vigilant'' to the possibility of continuing attacks.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: RULING ON TWINS TODAY -- A three-judge Court of Appeals panel will rule today whether doctors in Manchester can proceed with an operation separating joined twins that would sacrifice the life of one to save the other. The appeal was brought by the parents, who say their Catholic faith compels them to let nature take its course even though it will result in the almost certain death of both girls.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: NEW CHARGE FOR EX-SPY -- A former British spy, David Shayler, who faces accusations of disclosing state secrets in a 1997 newspaper article, was charged with a new violation of the Official Secrets Act by passing information obtained by tapping phones. Mr. Shayler, 34, was quoted in the article as saying that the M.I.5 domestic intelligence service he once worked for kept files on British politicians who are now members of the government and that M.I.6 plotted to kill Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya.</p>

        <p>NETHERLANDS: LOCKERBIE TRIAL RESUMING -- The trial of two men accused of blowing up a Pan Am plane in 1988 is scheduled to resume next week with a Libyan double agent on the witness stand. The trial was delayed for a month while the C.I.A. looked for cables related to the agent, Abdul Majid Giaka, who was its informant in Malta when the bomb was reportedly put on the plane there. Mr. Giaka is the only witness expected to link the defendants to the suitcase with the bomb inside.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: BASQUES ACCUSED IN SLAYING -- Suspected Basque separatists shot dead a town councilor from the governing Popular Party in a Barcelona suburb, bringing to 13 the number of deaths linked to the E.T.A. independence group this year. Jose Luis Ruiz Casado, 42, was shot twice in the head by two gunmen as he walked to his car.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: DEADLINE FOR INDIANS -- Federal fishery officials gave Indian lobster fishermen until this morning to pull illegal traps from a bay in eastern New Brunswick. Bob Rae, a former Ontario premier and mediator in the dispute, quit the talks in frustration Wednesday night. Last week the police arrested 14 Mi'kmaq Indians and seized four of their fishing boats. The Indians say they have a right to set as many as 5,200 traps.</p>

        <p>CANADA: SCHOOL BOOK RULING UPHELD -- British Columbia's Court of Appeals has upheld the right of a local school board to bar three books about same-sex couples from kindergarten and first-grade classrooms. The board in Surrey, a suburb with many immigrants from India and China, barred teachers from using ''Asha's Moms,'' ''Belinda's Bouquet,'' and ''One Dad, Two Dads, Brown Dads, Blue Dads.''</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: RIOTS NEAR SUHARTO HOME -- Under a hail of rocks and gasoline bombs, riot policemen used tear gas to disperse about 200 protesters near the home of former President Suharto after Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said he was ready to force Mr. Suharto into court for trial on corruption charges if he defied a third summons to appear. Six protesters were arrested.</p>

        <p>JAPAN: WHALERS WELCOMED -- In an exuberant ceremony of defiance of international pressure to end whaling, officials, whaling advocates and crew members celebrated the return to port of a vessel carrying the remains of 88 whales. Some 80 people cheered at Tokyo's Oi Bay as the International Whaling Commission's Japanese government commissioner pronounced a toast to the crew of the Nisshinmaru, which caught minke whales and Bryde's whales during a 47-day trip.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: TOWN DESTROYED -- Reporters who were taken on a military tour of a town recaptured from ethnic Tamil rebels found it had been largely destroyed by the long-range weapons both sides now use. The Hindu, an Indian daily, said not a single building in Chavakachcheri had survived intact. All civilians fled before the shootout.</p>
