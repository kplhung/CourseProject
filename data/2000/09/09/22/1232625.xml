        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, began broadcasting two 15-second television advertisements statewide yesterday. This one, ''Taxes,'' criticizes his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, accusing her of supporting tax increases over the years. The other, ''Scores,'' paints a negative picture of her record on education as the first lady of Arkansas.</p>
        <p>TITLE -- ''Taxes''</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- A small picture of Mrs. Clinton in a red box next to a banner that says ''Clinton.'' Below the banner is the phrase ''Record on taxes.'' As the narrator speaks, the word ''Expensive'' flashes on the screen in gray, and then ''supported 15 tax increases'' and ''higher taxes on Social Security'' pop up. The closing scene is a picture of Mrs. Clinton in the center of a black screen over the words: ''Hillary Clinton. You just can't trust her on taxes.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''What's Hillary Clinton's record on taxes? Expensive. Hillary Clinton has supported 15 tax increases, including higher taxes on Social Security benefits. Hillary Clinton. You just can't trust her on taxes.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- To back up its claims, the Lazio campaign released a list of tax increases enacted by the federal government through President Clinton's 1993 tax legislation and by the state of Arkansas when she was first lady there in the late 1980's.</p>
        <p>The Clinton campaign responded with a list of tax cuts Mrs. Clinton has proposed to spur the economy upstate. They also pointed out newspaper and magazine accounts quoting Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, as crediting the 1993 plan with helping to stimulate the economy.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The negative commercial, as with several others questioning the trustworthiness of Mrs. Clinton, comes as two polls this week suggested that voters were developing a negative perception of Mr. Lazio, based in part on his performance in last week's debate. But, although people generally say they abhor them, negative commercials have been effective. This ad, though short on visual panache, offers reinforcement to Mr. Lazio's base of conservative supporters who despise tax increases almost as much as they despise Mrs. Clinton, and it may raise questions among elderly voters concerned about the fate of Social Security.</p>
