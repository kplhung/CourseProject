      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Lucy had Desi, Lewis had Martin and Seinfeld had Costanza.</p>
        <p>Keyshawn does not have Wayne.</p>
        <p>The National Football League's favorite odd couple -- who have traded zingers and barbs in recent months -- has lost one-half of its act. The Jets' Wayne Chrebet, the foil for Keyshawn Johnson's five-month diatribe of bruised ego and hurt feelings, has been a no-show in the Jets' locker room this week and has declined numerous requests from reporters to talk about this week's showdown with Johnson and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>
        <p>So gone are the days when Chrebet would mischievously suggest that Johnson, his ex-teammate and fellow star receiver, could not stop talking about him because he was in love with him. Chrebet has chosen to lay so low this week that reporters have not even seen him since the conclusion of Sunday's Jets victory over Buffalo. Chrebet disappeared from the locker room quickly after the game and hasn't been heard from since.</p>
        <p>Chrebet, who usually talks to reporters once a week, is expected to make a scheduled appearance on a radio show this afternoon. But the Jets have told their players to bite their tongues about Johnson, who has had more face time than Oprah this week, and Chrebet has clearly complied.</p>
        <p>''Wayne has done so much for this team,'' safety Victor Green said. ''That's all we can go by. Keyshawn is going to be Keyshawn. He's going to talk. Wayne is not taking heat. Wayne is having a good season. The stats don't lie. He's doing the right thing by being modest. When he gets on the field, that's where he's doing his talking.''</p>
        <p>Chrebet's game has spoken well for him so far. He has 13 receptions for 154 yards and two touchdowns in the Jets' first three games. In the spectacular fourth-quarter comeback victory over New England, Chrebet caught both touchdown passes, one for 28 yards on the left sideline in which he successfully reached out for the end zone after snaring the ball, and the other for 2 yards after the ball slipped through the hands of cornerback Antonio Langham. Chrebet is frequently double-teamed, but five of his receptions have come on third down and 11 of his catches have given the Jets a first down.</p>
        <p>In the Jets' locker room this week, only center Kevin Mawae has seen fit to fire back at Johnson; others have been more guarded in their remarks. Johnson is still close to many members of the team and said he will have dinner with at least 10 Jets players Saturday night. Jets players have been careful not to criticize Johnson for his intemperate remarks about Chrebet, the player he has had so much trouble acknowledging as an equal.</p>
        <p>One of those Jets players, cornerback Aaron Glenn, said he respects Johnson for saying what he feels.</p>
        <p>''Wayne is a grown man,'' Glenn said. ''Wayne knows what he's doing. Keyshawn knows what he's doing.''</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh, blamed repeatedly by Johnson for his trade to Tampa Bay, has not injected himself into the fray publicly, shying away from the ''noncompetitive issues'' that can be a distraction to the team. But he tweaked Johnson on Wednesday when he said that the Jets are ranked high in the league in big plays ''despite the fact that we're playing with Dedric Who and the other guy.'' And Groh went to extremes today in praising Chrebet.</p>
        <p>''He's one of the better players in the N.F.L.,'' Groh said. ''There's a quality that's undefinable about certain kinds of players, whether they're Larry Bird or Wayne Gretzky or Wayne Chrebet or Magic Johnson. There's a craftiness about those players. They have their finger on the pulse of the game.''</p>
        <p>It would be interesting to know what Johnson thinks of Chrebet being placed in such exalted company. But Johnson was told by Tampa Bay officials this week to tone down his remarks about the Jets, and in recent days, he has complied.</p>
        <p>In fact, on today's national conference call for football writers, Johnson made what amounted to an extraordinary concession.</p>
        <p>''He is a good football player,'' Johnson said of Chrebet. ''He has been very productive in helping the Jets get to 3-0. He is a very good football player.''</p>
        <p>Johnson also denied that there was friction in the locker room when he was with the Jets.</p>
        <p>''You can go to certain players in the locker room and always they're the only two or three that will say that there is a friction,'' Johnson said. ''For the most part, if you go to the right guys, they will tell you No. 19 can care less. Because if you don't ask him, he doesn't go around every day talking about Wayne Chrebet.''</p>
        <p>The Jets can't wait until they don't have to go around talking about Chrebet and Johnson.</p>
        <p>''Speaking from experience, it really doesn't matter what anybody outside this organization thinks,'' said quarterback Vinny Testaverde, Chrebet's closest friend on the team. ''If you allow certain comments to distract you, then it's only going to bring you down. Whether Wayne is the No. 1 receiver or not will be determined by how many balls he catches. He's a very important part of our offense.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>For the second week in a row, the Jets have nobody listed on the injury report. . . . Despite the return of DWIGHT STONE, LAVERANUES COLES and KEVIN WILLIAMS will continue to return kicks Sunday. Williams, who returned a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown against Buffalo, was named the American Football Conference's special teams player of the week.</p>
