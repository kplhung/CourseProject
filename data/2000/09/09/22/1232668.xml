        <p>On two days in June, groups of teenage boys sexually assaulted girls in two New York City schoolyards during school hours, but the safety officers and administrators on duty failed to take action or notify the police, according to a report issued yesterday by the special investigator for the city school system.</p>
        <p>The second of those assaults went unreported just four days after Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, in response to the first assault, sent to school principals a detailed list of procedures to follow after a serious incident like a sexual assault, education officials said.</p>
        <p>On Friday, June 9, at Intermediate School 278 in Marine Park, Brooklyn, groups of boys sexually assaulted at least seven girls, most of them 12 years old, tearing at the girls' clothes and groping them while throwing them into sprinklers that were operating in a playground next to the school, according to the report.</p>
        <p>The attacks occurred as hundreds of students milled about the schoolyard for part of the day on a largely unsupervised ''extended recess,'' said Edward F. Stancik, the special commissioner of investigation for the New York City school district, who issued the report. The school's principal declared the recess period because at least 35 teachers were absent that day, some for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, and there were not enough substitute teachers to cover all classes, Mr. Stancik said.</p>
        <p>According to the report, at least three victims said a school official was in the schoolyard during the assaults and even broke up a related incident. Some of the girls who complained were ordered by school officials to write out a statement but were then told to return to the schoolyard, the report said.</p>
        <p>The following Monday, after parents of the victims notified the police, six boys were arrested and charged with first-degree sexual assault.</p>
        <p>The second incident occurred on June 20, when a group of boys at Middle School 180 in Rockaway Park, Queens, held a 12-year-old girl upside down in the schoolyard while they groped her and tried to get her clothes off, the report said. According to one investigator, the boys chanted ''Puerto Rican Day Parade'' during the attack, which occurred nine days after the Central Park attacks that followed the National Puerto Rican Day Parade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stancik said that after the victim's mother called police that night, seven boys were arrested and charged with first-degree sexual assault.</p>
        <p>At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Stancik vigorously criticized the principals of the two schools, as well as two school deans to whom the incidents were reported, for failing to promptly report the assaults to the police. Asked whether the school safety officers, who work in the schools but are trained and managed by the Police Department, similarly failed to oversee student safety or to report the incidents, Mr. Stancik said his office did not have jurisdiction over the safety officers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stancik said that he had referred information about the actions of the school safety officers to the Police Department's Internal Affairs division and had asked Mr. Levy to discipline the administrators at the schools.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued yesterday, Mr. Levy said he had directed the superintendents of Districts 22 and 27, where the attacks took place, to conduct their own inquiries and ''take appropriate action.'' On June 16, he sent an e-mail message to principals spelling out procedures for reporting serious incidents.</p>
        <p>Matthew Bromme, superintendent of District 27, has reassigned the principal of M.S. 180 and the dean to whom the incident was originally reported, education officials said.</p>
        <p>The report also states that the school safety officer at I.S. 278, who said she was inside when the assaults occurred, told investigators that students there commonly played a ''game'' in which one student rubbed against and fondled the sexual organs of another student. According to the report, the officer had not previously reported that conduct.</p>
