        <p>It was not quite the daily double at the Meadowlands, but today's running of the Keirin cycling race was a reminder that not all Olympic sports have the heroic pedigree of the decathlon.</p>
        <p>The Keiren (pronounced KAY-rin) is making its debut in these Olympics. It has thrived in Japan since the 1940's, where it is the object of huge parimutuel betting. The appeal of the race is its flukiness.</p>
        <p>That unpredictability proved poison to the top American cyclist, Marty Nothstein, who on Wednesday won the first track-cycling gold medal for the United States in a nonboycott Olympic Games since 1904. Today, Nothstein finished a deflating fifth out of six riders in the Keiren. Florian Rousseau of France won in 11.020 seconds (only the last lap is timed), while Gary Neiwand of Australia was second and Jens Fiedler of Germany third.</p>
        <p>Nothstein was the sole American racing in a field with two French and two German riders. That, he said, made him vulnerable to tactical blocking by riders who were trying to help their countrymen win. ''I knew going in, with two Frenchmen and two Germans, it was going to be nasty,'' Nothstein said afterward. ''It's a new event for the Games and they've got to work out the kinks.''</p>
        <p>After the race, Nothstein exchanged words with the second German rider, Jan van Eijden, whom he said blocked him in the last half-lap of the race when Nothstein made a final lunge for the front.  Blocking to help a teammate is legal and is common practice in team competition. The gamesmanship did not prevent Neiwand, the Australian, from winning a silver medal. But clearly, Nothstein was a juicier target.</p>
        <p>Nothstein left little doubt that he was happier with a gold medal for sprint racing than for Keiren. ''Sprint has been around since 1896,'' Nothstein said. ''It's the most prestigious event. That's what I trained for.''</p>
        <p>Keiren is an odd duck among cycling events. It is a two-and-a-half-lap sprint that follows five and a half laps of riding behind the equivalent of a pace car, a motorized bicycle equipped with a camera and a flashing light pole.</p>
        <p>The position of the riders can shift radically in the frantic jockeying just before the pace bike pulls off the course. If a rider is hemmed in by other cyclists, he may not be able to position himself to go for the lead. In Japan, Keirin meets can last three days, during which the riders are sometimes confined to the track to prevent them from mingling with bookies. The worry is that the riders will be paid to throw races.</p>
        <p>Nothstein's evening began on a shaky note, when he finished fifth in the first round. After riding in fourth place during the pace laps -- farther back than he normally prefers -- Nothstein found himself boxed in during the sprint laps, and was unable to break out of the pack.</p>
        <p>In the elimination round, known as the repechage, Nothstein seized the second position behind Rousseau. Nothstein tailed the Frenchman until the last quarter lap, when he swerved high on the banked track and passed Rousseau on the right to win by a half-wheel length. In the second round, Nothstein was in the pole position from the starting gun. He fell briefly to third place as the sprint began, but exploded in the last lap to overtake Rousseau by more than a bike length.</p>
        <p>Nothstein said he slept only four hours on Wednesday night after winning the sprint race. And so, he felt stiff before the first round. But he said he warmed up quickly and was in top form for the final round. ''That's why I was so mad,'' he said with a tight smile.</p>
        <p>Nothstein's travails were scarcely noticed by the raucous crowd at the Olympic Velodrome. They were celebrating an unexpected victory by an Australian team, Scott McGrory and Brett Aitken, in the Madison race. The 240-lap race is named for Madison Square Garden, where it was first run.</p>
        <p>Nothstein, a 29-year-old native of Trexlertown, Pa., said the defeat in Keirin would not send him away from Sydney on a sour note. ''Bike racing is an addiction of mine,'' he said. ''I love winning.''</p>
