        <p>Just when Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for Senate, seemed to have put questions about his charitable giving behind him, a botched answer in a relatively pressure-free forum tonight set off a new wave of questions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine appeared at the Eagleton Institute of Politics here for an hourlong question-and-answer session with Rutgers University students, many of them members of the college Democratic club. Most of the questions were routine and issue-oriented, the kind Mr. Corzine says he wishes would receive greater attention in his campaign against Representative Bob Franks, the Republican candidate.</p>

        <p>Just when Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for Senate, seemed to have put questions about his charitable giving behind him, a botched answer in a relatively pressure-free forum tonight set off a new wave of questions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine appeared at the Eagleton Institute of Politics here for an hourlong question-and-answer session with Rutgers University students, many of them members of the college Democratic club. Most of the questions were routine and issue-oriented, the kind Mr. Corzine says he wishes would receive greater attention in his campaign against Representative Bob Franks, the Republican candidate.</p>
        <p>But one of the first questions concerned his donations to groups whose leaders later endorsed his campaign, including $25,000 given last December by Mr. Corzine's family foundation to St. Matthews A.M.E. Church in Orange, N.J.</p>
        <p>The church's pastor, Reginald T. Jackson, is head of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey. He and 19 other members of the group endorsed Mr. Corzine in April, but at the time Mr. Corzine said nothing when a reporter asked if he had made any donations to the ministers, and one pastor indignantly said no.</p>
        <p>The gift was disclosed on Monday when Mr. Corzine, under pressure from Mr. Franks, released a list of his donations to charity since the beginning of 1999.</p>
        <p>Tonight, however, Mr. Corzine told the students that he had actually made the donation ''before I announced I was running for the U.S. Senate.'' And when confronted afterward by reporters, he tried to clarify by saying that he had pledged to make the donation before he became a candidate.</p>
        <p>In fact, he made the pledge to Mr. Jackson's church last July, after he had already formed an exploratory committee; he made the donation in December, three months after declaring his candidacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine grew agitated when asked, in any case, why he had not spoken up in April to clarify matters. ''The question was asked, was I, if I am not mistaken, framed in a time frame, or in a context, was Jon Corzine trying to buy political favor,'' he said. ''And he wasn't. Period.''</p>
        <p>When told that some ministers had been upset at the suggestion that their endorsements were for sale, Mr. Corzine said, ''I think you need to speak to them about how upset they are.''</p>
        <p>And with that, he allowed an aide to hustle him into a waiting car.</p>
