        <p>''Prince of Central Park'' is a nonmusical adaptation of a musical play originally produced by Abe Hirschfeld, the real estate developer and erstwhile newspaper publisher, at the Al Hirschfeld Theater in Miami Beach. In its original incarnation, it starred Nanette Fabray; it later appeared briefly on Broadway with Jo Anne Worley. It is now a vehicle for Kathleen Turner, Danny Aiello, Cathy Moriarty and Harvey Keitel, none of whom sing or look even vaguely inclined to do so.</p>

        <p>''Prince of Central Park'' is a nonmusical adaptation of a musical play originally produced by Abe Hirschfeld, the real estate developer and erstwhile newspaper publisher, at the Al Hirschfeld Theater in Miami Beach. In its original incarnation, it starred Nanette Fabray; it later appeared briefly on Broadway with Jo Anne Worley. It is now a vehicle for Kathleen Turner, Danny Aiello, Cathy Moriarty and Harvey Keitel, none of whom sing or look even vaguely inclined to do so.</p>
        <p>Stripped of its score, ''Prince of Central Park'' seems naked and painfully vulnerable. With no music to excuse or expand upon the stylized characters and improbable situations, the film, directed by the television veteran John Leekley (HBO's ''Spawn''), remains a sadly earthbound thing, mired in a dismal realism that lies far from its natural environment.</p>
        <p>The prince of the title is 12-year-old JJ Somerled (Frankie Nasso), a sad-eyed child who has been abandoned to the minimal care of a professional foster mother (Ms. Moriarty, rasping out her lines between belts of hooch). JJ's real mother, a beautiful Frenchwoman (Tina Holmes) who appears to him in occasional hallucinations, disappeared years before, leaving the boy with nothing but a religious medal and a tremendous natural gift for music.</p>
        <p>Following an unusually violent incident of abuse, JJ decides to run away from his foster mother's gaudy apartment in a Staten Island housing project and take the ferry to Manhattan, where he hopes to find his mother. Packing nothing but a portable keyboard (the batteries have long been dead, but JJ can still hear the music in his mind), he heads for the carousel in Central Park, scene of his last fond memory of his mother.</p>
        <p>Luckily for JJ, the park turns out to be full of people just as lonely and sensitive as he is. Ms. Turner plays Rebecca Cairn, a wealthy do-gooder who enjoys long, solitary bike rides and sleeping on park benches; Mr. Aiello is Rebecca's estranged husband, Noah, who fills his melancholy hours sailing the model ship that was the favorite toy of his departed son.</p>
        <p>Most alienated of all is Mr. Keitel, who has glued on a pair of big, bushy eyebrows and what appears to be a braided billy-goat beard to play the Guardian, the self-appointed king of Central Park. Like a troll in a German fairy tale, he lives under a bridge, demanding tribute from those who pass. He takes a shine to JJ and becomes his mentor, instructing him in the ways of life on the Great Lawn.</p>
        <p>With all of these characters fighting for JJ's affection (Ms. Moriarty also returns to the field), loneliness seems less a problem for the boy than keeping his social calendar in order. Given his ability to analyze and instantly cure the psychological problems of everyone he comes in contact with -- along with the fact that he can tickle the ivories like Oscar Peterson -- JJ doesn't seem likely to remain a waif for long.</p>
        <p>''Prince of Central Park'' is well meaning enough, but a dusty ordinariness settles over all of its components, from the insistently bland framing to the generic plot twists of the final reel. A couple of quick choruses of ''Greensleeves'' couldn't have hurt.</p>
        <p>''Prince of Central Park'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes strong language.</p>
