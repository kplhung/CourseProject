        <p>With the defense playing effectively and Clint Mathis scoring again, the first two playoff games showed that the MetroStars can offer a strong challenge for the Major League Soccer title.</p>
        <p>Mathis helped eliminate Dallas by scoring both goals in a 2-1 victory Wednesday night at the Cotton Bowl. The MetroStars won a playoff series for the first time in their four-year history. The two goals gave him 10 in five games this season against the Burn.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars await the winner of the Chicago-New England series, which will be completed tonight in Chicago. If Chicago advances, it will play host to two games in a two-of-three-game series against the MetroStars. If New England wins, the home advantage goes to the MetroStars.</p>
        <p>The league announced yesterday that regardless of who wins in Chicago, the MetroStars' first game in the next round will be Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>Mathis set a league record by scoring five goals in the MetroStars' 6-4 victory in Dallas on Aug. 26 and scored the first goal in the opening game of the playoff series at Giants Stadium. He also eliminated Dallas from the 1998 playoffs with a goal for the Los Angeles Galaxy.</p>
        <p>''My guardian angel must live in Dallas,'' said Mathis, who went without a goal in the three games before the playoffs after scoring 16 in the regular season. ''Somebody's been watching over me.''</p>
        <p>Mathis and Luis Hernandez of the Galaxy helped their teams sweep their playoff series. On Wednesday night, Hernandez, the league's highest-paid player, had his best game since his acquisition from Mexico. He had a goal and three assists in leading the Galaxy to a 5-2 triumph over Tampa Bay in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Known as El Matador, Hernandez  was a constant threat offensively and chased down Tampa Bay's defenders even as time expired with his team ahead by three goals.</p>
        <p>''He's showing us he is the big-game player we expected all along,'' Coach Sigi Schmid said of Hernandez, whose transfer to the league cost $4 million. ''The way he played lifted everyone.''</p>
        <p>The five goals by the Galaxy matched its highest total of the season. Los Angeles needed a penalty kick for a 1-0 victory in the opening game against Tampa Bay, which has gone eight playoff games over four years without a victory.</p>
        <p>While the MetroStars and Galaxy swept their series, the two other series, Kansas City-Colorado and Chicago-New England, have been extended to a third game.</p>
        <p>A 20-minute sudden-death period may be necessary if Colorado wins the third game Sunday because of the teams' scoreless tie in Game 2 on Wednesday night in Denver. To win a series, a team must accumulate 5 points; a victory is worth 3 points and a tie 1.</p>
        <p>Tony Meola and the Kansas City Wizards have yet to surrender a goal in their two playoff games against Colorado..</p>
        <p>Los Angeles will play the winner. If Colorado advances, the series will start in Los Angeles on Wednesday, but if Kansas City wins, the series will start in Kansas City on Friday.</p>
        <p>The winners of the semifinals will meet in M.L.S. Cup 2000 on Oct. 15 at R.F.K. Stadium in Washington.</p>
