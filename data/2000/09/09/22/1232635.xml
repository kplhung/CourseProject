        <p>Gov. George W. Bush today criticized Vice President Al Gore's call to tap the nation's petroleum reserves as ''bad policy'' that sought ''short-term political gain at the cost of long-term national security.''</p>
        <p>On a day when high gasoline prices moved to the center of the presidential race, Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, turned to the issue repeatedly in response to Mr. Gore's proposal that oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve -- a government stockpile of nearly 600 million barrels of crude oil -- be made available to the market. Mr. Gore called it a way to bring down oil costs before winter arrived.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who was once in the oil business, attacked the Democrat's plan as he met with employees at  Thermagon, a technology company, in a session set up to showcase Mr. Bush's proposal to shore up Social Security by diverting a portion of payroll taxes to individual investment accounts.</p>
        <p>''The strategic reserve is an insurance policy meant for a sudden disruption of our energy supply or for war,'' Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, said. ''These reserves should not be used as an attempt to drive down oil prices right before an election.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said the Gore proposal was an example of the vice president's willingness to shift his positions on policy and pander to voters. He said Mr. Gore had resisted such a move last winter, pointing out then that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries could nullify the effects of any oil release by simply cutting back on production. ''Now that we are 47 days away from the election, he's changed his mind and is ignoring his own advice,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>At the company and earlier in the day in an appearance on the morning television talk show ''Live With Regis,'' Mr. Bush laid the blame for high oil prices with the Clinton administration. ''It means we haven't had an energy policy in this country for a long time,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He called for a combination of big-stick diplomacy and increased domestic oil exploration. ''We need to use our strong hand in the diplomatic circles to make clear to our friends overseas that we don't want them holding our nation and our consumers hostage,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>He also said the government should help low-income elderly people with their heating bills this winter, and should expand electric generating capacity and support hydroelectric projects. But in response to a questioner at Thermagon who favored nuclear power, Mr. Bush said he did not think Americans were ''ready for a nuclear initiative.''</p>
        <p>In Springdale, Ark., Mr. Cheney echoed Mr. Bush's accusations and also called for more domestic oil drilling and the building of more refineries. He had particularly harsh words for the Department of Energy, saying, ''These are the same folks who are safeguarding our nuclear secrets down at Los Alamos who are responsible for our energy policy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney said he was especially interested in allowing oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  in Alaska, a proposal that Mr. Bush supports and that environmentalists, and Mr. Gore, fiercely oppose.</p>
        <p>The Republicans' remarks drew quick criticism from the Gore campaign. ''Of course Bush and Cheney would oppose measures to bring down the cost of oil because they're in the pocket of the oil industry,'' said Kym Spell, a campaign spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>At his appearance in Ohio, a hotly contested state, Mr. Bush received an endorsement from Elliott Roosevelt Jr., a grandson of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic president who signed Social Security into law in 1935, creating one of the government's most cherished programs. Mr. Roosevelt, who has long worked in the oil and gas business in Texas, said he believed his grandfather would have approved of Mr. Bush's Social Security plan.</p>
        <p>Striking themes he has been sounding all week as he has showcased an array of policy proposals, Mr. Bush reminded his listeners that the Social Security payroll tax ''is not the government's money, it's your money.'' He presented a couple who he said would end up with a $130,000 nest egg at their retirement if they were allowed to put 2 percent of their payroll taxes into private investment accounts. Such investment, he said, ''is no longer a government program. It's somebody's portfolio. It's somebody's assets.''</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Gore asserted that Mr. Bush would have to slash the remaining Social Security benefit to make the transition to private accounts. Otherwise, they said, the Bush plan would push the retirement system into insolvency even earlier than currently projected.</p>
