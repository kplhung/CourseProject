        <p>Vice President Al Gore said today that the White House should release a modest amount of oil from government stockpiles to try to stabilize oil prices, a move that Gov. George W. Bush immediately denounced as a political ploy that could endanger national security.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Clinton acts on Mr. Gore's proposal to release at least five million barrels of oil -- about what the United States consumes every six to nine hours -- it would be the first time the reserve had been tapped since the Persian Gulf war. Though the amount proposed for release was  small, analysts said it could bring down crude oil prices by sending a signal that the United States could be willing to follow up with larger interventions.</p>
        <p>But energy analysts said it would take weeks and maybe months for any savings to flow to consumers, and it is unclear whether the move would have any more than a temporary impact. [Page A18.]</p>
        <p>With fuel prices rising and the winter heating season approaching, both campaigns see energy prices as a potentially potent political issue. ''Families need action now,'' Mr. Gore said, ''and there are steps that we can take right now, before winter sets in, to make heating oil affordable and to bring gasoline prices down at the pump.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush blamed the Clinton administration for the rising prices, saying, ''We haven't had an energy policy in this country for some time.'' [Page A18.]</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's recommendation is a break with long-standing administration policy about utilizing the reserves, and it is a reversal of his own earlier recommendations, made last winter when prices were significantly lower than they are now. Mr. Clinton has been reluctant to tap into the reserves as well, noting that they were created to assure an oil supply in case of a major disruption,  brought on by a war or an embargo, rather than as a method of counteracting price increases.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, administration officials broadly hinted today that Mr. Clinton would probably permit at least one ''test release'' of oil soon. Mr. Gore urged several such releases in his speech today.</p>
        <p>''The thinking is that it may be worth determining how the market would react,'' one senior official said. Another official noted that when the idea was first floated at White House meetings last week, two of Mr. Gore's senior aides, including his national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, sat in the meetings. The White House apparently decided to let Mr. Gore propose the idea first, giving him public authorship of the plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides have regularly tried to portray Mr. Bush, a former oil company executive, and his running mate, Dick Cheney, who recently ran a company that services the oil industry, as captive of oil interests. In recent days, Mr. Gore has been seeking ways to demonstrate his concern about rising prices.</p>
        <p>But his campaign's search for a significant announcement ran headlong into a furious argument within the White House in recent days. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who Republicans assert did too little to head off price increases earlier in the year by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, argued for releasing 60 million barrels, or about a fifth of the total strategic reserve, administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>That led to an angry retort from Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, who wrote in a memorandum to Mr. Clinton that such a release would amount to a ''substantial policy mistake'' and would, at best have a ''modest effect'' on prices. A report on the memo was carried today in The Wall Street Journal.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Summers issued a statement endorsing Mr. Gore's far more modest proposal, saying,  ''There are a number of approaches for prudent use of the strategic petroleum reserve, including those the vice president has proposed, which could be appropriate in current circumstances.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore went out of his way today to portray his proposal as a grand one that would have a broad, immediate effect. ''We cannot just wait around,'' Mr. Gore said, 47 days before the presidential election, as he stood in front of oil storage tanks at a family-owned oil distribution business. ''In the face of rising prices for gasoline and home-heating oil, I support oil releases from our national strategic petroleum reserve.''</p>
        <p>At a campaign appearance in Cleveland, Mr. Bush derided the initiative and suggested that Mr. Gore was ignoring advice from top officials of his own administration.</p>
        <p>''The strategic reserve is an insurance policy meant for sudden disruption of oil supplies or for war,'' Mr. Bush said, adding that it ''should not be used as an attempt to drive down oil prices right before an election.''</p>
        <p>While prices are up considerably -- the Energy Department estimates that home heating oil will cost 30 percent more this winter than it did last winter -- on a historical basis gasoline prices are far from their highest. The Energy Department notes that in the third week of June, the average cost of regular gas rose to $1.68 per gallon, before falling considerably in the middle of August. By comparison, at the height of the oil shortage of 1981, gasoline cost about $2.69 per gallon, once the price is adjusted for inflation and expressed in current dollars.</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Gore has calculated that rising costs could hurt him in  several swing states, which are heavy users of home heating oil.</p>
        <p>In interviews today, administration officials and economists outside government said that it was hard to predict how a modest increase in the supply could affect the psychology of the oil markets. But Mr. Gore's hope is that the threat of tapping the strategic reserve would have much the same effect as the threat of a currency intervention by the Federal Reserve Bank: The mere suggestion of a future willingness to act can move prices.</p>
        <p>In fact, when news of Mr. Gore's proposal reached the markets today, oil prices immediately dropped by $1.24, or 3.5 percent, to $34.20 a barrel in New York trading. Mr. Gore was vague today about exactly how much oil might be released under a system of ''swaps,'' in which oil is essentially lent to oil companies in return for a commitment from them to refill the strategic reserve next spring. He said he advocated several of the 5-million-barrel swaps, until prices stabilized.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Gore's proposal is unlikely to bring consumer prices down before the election, President Clinton noted two days ago that there is ''still plenty of time'' to affect home heating oil prices. And that could be a potent issue in another election -- the one that pits Hillary Rodham Clinton against Rick Lazio for the New York Senate seat. Home heating oil is widely used in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>One of the strongest arguments against releasing oil from the reserves was publicly articulated earlier this year by Mr. Gore himself.</p>
        <p>Back then, as heating-oil prices rose, Mr. Gore said he was afraid that tapping into the reserve would prompt oil-producing countries to cut back on their production.</p>
        <p>''All they would have to do is cut back a little bit on supply and they'd wipe out any impact from releasing oil from that reserve,'' Mr. Gore said in mid-February.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign said today that circumstances had become more urgent. ''We're on the cusp of a real issue right now,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman. ''People have to buy this stuff and it's at a 10-year high today. It's gone up $10 a barrel over the last couple weeks. Those are very, very high prices and for middle-class families, for working families all over the country; those prices are being passed on to them, and they're having a difficult time affording that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore used his speech today to return to his populist theme that oil companies are too powerful and are ''profiteering'' as prices rise.</p>
        <p>''We should not be building our lives around a fuel source that is often distant, too often uncertain and too easily manipulated by foreign oil and big oil,'' he said, urging the development of cleaner, more reliable energy sources.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's proposal today was part of a larger energy package that also calls for giving people up to $6,000 in tax credits to purchase more fuel-efficient cars. The Administration has proposed giving $4,000 in tax credits for the purchase of electric cars and $3,000 for hybrid cars, which use a combination of gas and electricity, at a total cost of $2 billion over five years. Mr. Gore is proposing a $6,000 credit for electric or fuel cell cars and $5,000 for hybrid cars.</p>
        <p>In His Own Words  AL GORE</p>
        <p>Remarks to employees yesterday at Burchoil in Hollywood, Md.:</p>
        <p>''This summer I called for a federal investigation of concentration, non-competitiveness and pricing practices in the oil industry, and we're still awaiting the results of that inquiry. But this isn't rocket science, even though gasoline right now seems to be priced a lot like rocket fuel. We know what is going on here, and we have to end it. And I promise you this -- if I am president, I am going to stand up to big oil and demand fairer gasoline prices for families and an end to unfair profiteering.</p>
        <p>We also have to press OPEC and big oil to act responsibly and we also need aggressive national action right now. In the face of rising prices for gasoline and home-heating oil, I support oil releases from our national strategic petroleum reserve. . . .</p>
        <p>These short-term measures that I've described here are urgent and vital, but as I mentioned earlier, by themselves they are not enough. . . . I'm proposing an energy security and environment trust, a commitment to a more prosperous economy powered by cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy for families.''</p>
