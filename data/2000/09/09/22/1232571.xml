        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* ALTAN, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536. Altan is one of Ireland's finest traditionalist groups, playing venerable jigs and reels with nuanced arrangements; before the musicians let their fingers fly, they plan trajectories from lacework delicacy to steely dance drive. Altan also includes a superb singer, Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh, whose feathery voice holds reserves of tender melancholy. Tonight at 8; tickets are $25 to $30 (Jon Pareles).</p>

        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* ALTAN, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536. Altan is one of Ireland's finest traditionalist groups, playing venerable jigs and reels with nuanced arrangements; before the musicians let their fingers fly, they plan trajectories from lacework delicacy to steely dance drive. Altan also includes a superb singer, Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh, whose feathery voice holds reserves of tender melancholy. Tonight at 8; tickets are $25 to $30 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>''BODY AND SOUL,'' Avery Fisher Hall,  (212) 721-6500. It's a production of Jazz at Lincoln Center and the Film Society of Lincoln Center, and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra will play an original extended work by Wycliffe Gordon in front of the 1925 Oscar Micheaux silent film ''Body and Soul.'' Mr. Gordon, a trombonist, has always been brilliant in the brass section of the orchestra, and he stepped out front a bit more during the band's summer tour, playing (and singing) Ellington music for dancers. But this is his first long-form composition, and -- unsurprisingly -- it's said to be full of gospel and blues. There are two performances on Sunday, at 5 and 8 p.m.; tickets are $20-$55 (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>SARAH BRIGHTMAN, The Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741. The ethereal soprano who flew out of Andrew Lloyd Weber's grasp (she must be tired of being known as the ex of the show-tune Rachmaninoff) flies to the moon for her latest mix of pop and classical music, ''La Luna'' (Angel). Reportedly, the cosmic effects for this show mounted in the album's honor are, well, out of this world.  Tonight at 8; tickets are $88, $68, and $58 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>JONATHA BROOKE, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Jonatha Brooke is the kind of singer-songwriter whom fans treat as a therapist, muse and celebrity friend. Her lucid yet romantic music plays around with folk traditions but always returns to the wisdom of the heart. These shows will offer material from her first self-released studio album, which hits stores and the Internet in a few months. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and 10; tickets are $27 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* DAVE DOUGLAS QUARTET, Iridium, 48 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. Last winter, Mr. Douglas, the trumpeter, brought the Dutch pianist Misha Mengelberg into a Manhattan club with him for a one-nighter; in a quartet, they played a set of Mr. Mengelberg's tunes, some of them dating back to the 50's. With little preparation, it worked. Mr. Mengelberg is a humorous player and composer, but his older jazz tunes, as it turns out, don't fool around: they're a lost trove of Monk- and Herbie Nichols-inspired music, wry and swinging. What's more, Mr. Mengelberg's longtime colleague, the inexhaustible (and anarchically funny) drummer Han Bennink, is along for the ride this week, and it's rare that American audiences get to see them together. Sets through Sunday night are at 8:30 and 10:30; cover charge is $25 plus a $10 food and drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>MARTY EHRLICH'S TRAVELER'S TALES, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. In contrast to his bass-cello-clarinet group, or the all-saxophone group he occasionally leads through the compositions of Julius Hemphill, or his wild, free-ranging trio with Mark Dresser and Andrew Cyrille, this is the saxophonist's more formal jazz quartet. The music he writes for it -- the freshest batch of it can be heard on the new ''Malinke's Dance'' (Omnitone) -- is full of wistful emotion and winding counterpoint  between saxophones. Aside from Mr. Ehrlich, with his battery of wind instruments, the band includes the saxophonist Tony Malaby, bassist Jerome Harris and drummer Bobby Previte. Sets are tomorrow night at 8 and 10; cover charge is $10 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>MARK EITZEL, Brownies, 169 Avenue A, at 11th Street, East Village, (212) 420-8392 and  Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Depression is Mark Eitzel's element; as leader of the American Music Club and through a solo career he has anatomized melancholy down to the molecular level. In a weary voice, with tunes that blur folk songs and torch songs in a smoky haze, he looks at estrangement and betrayal, loneliness and separation. It's easy to believe him when he sings, ''I'm tired to the bone of always telling you goodbye.'' Tonight at 11 at Brownies, on a bill with Eszter Balint (at 10) and Chris Lee (at 9); admission is $10. Tomorrow night at 8:30 at Maxwell's, with Sue Garner and Angel Dean (at 7:30): admission is $10 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>ELYSIAN FIELDS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Elysian Fields plays languid songs that sound best in a late-night haze, as Jennifer Charles's breathy voice hints at decadence and vulnerability while Oren Bloedow wraps the songs in slinky, deadpan guitar. Tomorrow night at midnight; admission is $5 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>ANSON FUNDERBURGH/LOU ANN BARTON, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. A double bill of rowdy Texas roadhouse blues. Anson Funderburgh, a guitarist based in Dallas, writes the songs and jabs and bends his solos behind the singer in his band, Sam Myers; Lou Ann Barton has been belting tales of no-account men, sweet loving women and strong whiskey for two decades. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; admission is $30 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>GISSELLE, Latin Quarter, 2551 Broadway, at 96th Street, (212) 864-7600. Not to be confused with the Brazilian model of the moment, Gisselle is a Puerto Rican singer, an ex-model who moved into merengue and now, with the Miami Sound Machine brain trust behind her, is aiming for a pan-American audience with pop-salsa love songs in Spanish. She turns those songs into sultry entreaties, though she'll probably still make some room for the lighthearted tales of infidelity and sexual bravado she turned into merengue hits. Tomorrow night around midnight; admission is $15; $20 after 10 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* DAVID GRAY, Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224. David Gray's voice has a sharp, nervous quaver that keeps him sounding frayed and unpretty. He sings about tears and flames, seashores and rainy nights, strumming an acoustic guitar over his band's syncopated vamps; he owes a lot to Van Morrison. And like Mr. Morrison at his best, he can cut through potential cliches to reclaim the honest emotion behind them. Five for Fighting opens the show tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.; tickets are $19 in advance, $22 tomorrow (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* CHRIS KNOX, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. ''Believe it or not, I do this stuff to foster happiness,'' New Zealand-based Chris Knox wrote in the notes accompanying his eighth album, the recent ''Beat'' (Jetset). As if anyone who's heard this self-styled wise fool, who produces gleaming pop songs as easily as he does unchartable rants, could doubt his motives! Mr. Knox is one of the good souls in a pop scene full of vanity and suspicion. He deals with heavy subjects on ''Beat,'' notably the death of his father, but doesn't sacrifice his essential sense of grace. Sunday at 8 and 10 p.m.; tickets are $10 (Powers).</p>
        <p>OLIVER LAKE STEEL QUARTET, Up Over Jazz Cafe, 351 Flatbush Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 398-5413. This alto saxophonist with shades of Eric Dolphy has had a continuing fascination with the timbre of the steel-pan drum; this is his band, and it explores the possible links between jazz and Caribbean music.  Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 10:30 and midnight; cover charge is $18 per set (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>LATIN JAZZ ENSEMBLE, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. This five-piece group is led by Brian Lynch, an exciting, energetic player who was the last trumpeter in Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers (during the late 1980's) and one of the better musicians in the New York Latin-Jazz scene; the same could be said for the rhythm-section members John Benitez, on bass, and Dafnis Pietro, on drums. Their Sunday night gig at Smoke has become a regular hangout. Sets are at 9, 11, and 12:30; no cover (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>LEGENDS OF THE DELTA BLUES, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Robert Jr. Lockwood, Homesick James, Henry Townsend and Honeyboy Edwards. The true Delta blues hold bleak insights, tangled syncopation and rude vitality, and this package tour includes four bluesmen who are close to its roots. Robert Jr. Lockwood, born in 1915, learned some of his songs directly from Robert Johnson, though he later added an idiosyncratic streak of jazz. Honeyboy Edwards, also born in 1915, played with Johnson in the 1930's, and still dispenses lean, spiky guitar parts, picking and sliding, to be answered by his own voice and harmonica. Henry Townsend, 90, accompanies his hard-luck songs with either rippling barrelhouse piano or snapping, percussive guitar picking, and Homesick James is a slide-guitar disciple of Elmore James. Tomorrow at 8 and 10:30 p.m.; admission is $35 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>LISA LOEB, Shine, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 941-0900. Lisa Loeb burst on the scene like a firecracker in 1995 with her surprise hit single ''Stay.'' Later she made an album called ''Firecracker,'' released in 1997. But the sparkly-voiced, witty Ms. Loeb hasn't generated many explosions since then, failing to release a third album. Why do female songwriters have to fight so hard to have normal careers? One can only hope that the new material she offers tonight (probably assisted by her chief collaborator, the guitarist Dweezil Zappa) will light the way into her future. Tonight at 9; tickets are $20 (Powers).</p>
        <p>LUCKY DUBE, ARROW, SINGSING, FLOXY BEE, Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem (212) 749-5838 or (212) 531-5305. This African-diaspora concert is headlined by Lucky Dube from South Africa, a reggae singer who clings to socially conscious lyrics; he blends reggae with hints of the Zulu music he grew up on. Arrow, from Monserrat, carried soca around the world with the hit ''Hot! Hot! Hot!''; Floxy Bee, from Nigeria, has been working toward a pan-African fusion that holds on to Nigerian hikosso music. The bill also includes Singsing, a group of Senegalese drummers. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $30 to $50 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>CHRISTIAN McBRIDE, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. In the early 90's the young Mr. McBride immediately set himself up as one of the most gifted bassists in jazz, with a deep musical intelligence, a rich tone and a dexterity that Wynton Marsalis, among others, took to right away. Unlike Mr. Marsalis, he's a committed fan of funk and fusion, and his new record, ''Sci-Fi'' (Verve/ Universal), celebrates that tendency, offering tunes by Steely Dan and others. On a good night, the band can make the material seem like a pretty secondary issue; it includes the saxophonist Ron Blake and drummer Rodney Green, both capable of setting fires. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $25 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* BRAD MEHLDAU TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. This jazz pianist's long-standing trio makes dramatic music that leaps from the unconscious; it can play with your feelings, giving you a floating sensation as it layers different tempos, and as Mr. Mehldau meticulously controls his dynamics with keyboard and pedals. A classical background is set deeply within him, as is a determination to deliver fresh improvisations and not just rearrange a matrix of licks. He's been an important arrival in the last decade, and his new album, ''Places,'' continues his string of loosely conceptual albums for Warner Brothers. Sets through Sunday night are at 9:30 and 11:30, with a 1 a.m. show tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $20, and there is a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>MIGHTY FLASHLIGHT, BRIDE OF NO NO, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Old school art punk resurfaces on this double bill. Mighty Flashlight features Mike Fellows, who once played in the legendary Washington band Rites of Spring. The Chicago-based Bride of No No plays magnificently unkempt Dada-influenced noise rock, with Azita, formerly of the No Wave band Scissor Girls, leading the charge. Tonight at 8; tickets are $8 (Powers).</p>
        <p>MODEST MOUSE, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224. It isn't easy stepping down from the status of Big New Thing. This band, once based in Seattle but now geographically scattered between there and Florida, got hearts beating with angular rock that showed epic reach. Its recent major label debut, ''The Moon and Antarctica'' (Epic), lost it some credibility, perhaps because of its less chaotic sound. Will the cool kids show up to see if Modest Mouse still raises spirits in concert? It's hard to say. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $14 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* MUSAFIR, Great Hall at Cooper Union, Third Avenue at Seventh Street, East Village  (212) 545-7536. Rajasthan, in northwestern India, was where the migration of what are now called Rom, or Gypsies, began. Musafir (which means ''traveler'' in Farsi) includes musicians who come from three groups that live in the Thar desert -- Langas, Manghiyars and Saperas -- and it brings together some of the traditions the Rom may have carried with them. Its repertory includes meditational north Indian classical music, devotional music full of soaring improvisations and propulsive rhythms, and sinuous dancers who were once used to charm snakes. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>OVAL, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Markus Popp, the prime conceptualist behind the German electronic group Oval, is fascinated by the sounds of malfunctioning gadgets; he takes sounds like static or CD's skipping and computer-manipulates them into pieces that have a bloodless charm. Tonight at 10; admission is $12 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>RUDY RAY MOORE, Wetlands Preserve, 161 Hudson Street, at Laight Street, TriBeCa, (212) 386-3600. Rudy Ray Moore put on a turban and called himself Prince DuMarr when he sang blues and rhythm-and-blues on the black club circuit in the 1950's and 60's. But he's adopted for himself a trash-talking, high-living character called Dolemite: first as a comedy act, then in blaxploitation films. Rappers adopted him as a godfather and sampled his raunchy lines; his movie comeback, ''Dolemite 2000,'' is due next year. But he still wants to sing, and he's bringing a band, with backup singers and a horn section. Tomorrow night at 11; admission is $15 in advance, $18 at the door (Pareles).</p>
        <p>SIXTEEN HORSEPOWER, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Old-time country music was haunted by faith, death and love. David Eugene Edwards, the lead singer of Sixteen Horsepower, ties his own obsessions to the country tradition. He awaits apocalypse and hellfire around every turn, and banjo picking still surfaces amid the piano and electric guitars. Tomorrow night at 10; tickets are $10 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* ARCHIE SHEPP/ROSWELL RUDD QUINTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. It's a reunion of two important figures from jazz of the mid-60's. Together Mr. Shepp and Mr. Rudd made records like ''Mama Too Tight'' and ''Live in San Francisco,'' full of arranged wildness and originality; the saxophonist and trombonist had wide-ranging intellectual appetites and were committed simultaneously to two ideals: jazz as an evolved, self-conscious late-20th-century art music, in which a jeering, satirical sense of humor could come into play, and jazz as a popular black music that could hold its own against soul and rock. (One area specifically where they came together was New Orleans jazz. Mr. Shepp once said he wanted of his music ''the irreverence of a marching band returning from a funeral,'' and Mr. Rudd glories in playing funeral-style trombone.) Their careers went over some bumpy roads in the last 35 years, but they have left a lot of brave and spirited music in their wake; Mr. Rudd especially is sounding good these days. They'll play with three more of their early colleagues: the trombonist Grachan Moncur 2nd, the bassist Reggie Workman and the drummer Andrew Cyrille. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a $25 cover for the 8 and 10:30 sets; $18 cover for the midnight set. Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9, with an $18 cover. All sets have a $10 food or drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>SLIDERIDE, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. If you love trombones, this is your band: four trombonists -- Ray Anderson, Joe Bowie, Craig Harris and Gary Valente -- slur, whinny, jeer and harmonize their way through the jazz tradition. Shows are tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 9:30, and the cover charge is $10 plus a one drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>SOUTHERN CULTURE ON THE SKIDS/THE FLESHTONES, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Celebrating booze, hair spray, cheap motels and bad pickup lines, Southern Culture on the Skids cranks up bar-band blues, Tex-Mex music and honky-tonk with a sense of humor. The Fleshtones have held on to the sound of 1960's garage-rock year in and year out. Once it sounded like punk; now it's starting to sound like die-hard purism. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, with the Swingin' Neckbreakers opening tonight and DJ Rigrocker opening tomorrow. Admission is $15 (Pareles).</p>
