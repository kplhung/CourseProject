        <p>Melvin Hammonds, who lives in Long Island City and works for a janitorial service at Penn Station, propped his chin in his hand and looked across an ocean of late-afternoon commuters rushing to the Long Island Rail Road. Hammonds, a big Knicks fan, was pondering the significance of Patrick Ewing's departure.</p>
        <p>The Knicks were definitely quicker, he said, but they were definitely not as strong. Glen Rice is a good shooter, he said, but it is not as if the Knicks needed shooters.</p>
        <p>And then there was sentiment, which intruded on the trade's cold logic. Ewing is 38. He had played in New York for 15 years and helped the Knicks to the National Basketball Association finals twice, although he was injured and had to sit out the second trip to the championship round, against the San Antonio Spurs in 1999. Where was the loyalty?</p>
        <p>''It would have been nice to see him retire as a Knick,'' Hammonds said. ''To give so much to the team and then to be traded doesn't seem right. Now, even if the Knicks would retire his number, he wouldn't be part of the team to enjoy it.''</p>
        <p>He frowned. It was hard to say goodbye to a professional athlete who had become, to some fans, a New Yorker.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he should have played anywhere else but here,'' said John Shimkus, a New Yorker who was waiting for a train. ''He should have been allowed to retire gracefully. It's just not going to be the same for him to play for another team.''</p>
        <p>But for every fan who hated to see him go, there was another who was glad that Ewing was leaving.</p>
        <p>''I think he was long overdue to leave,'' said Ken Ersaud, of Florham Park, N.J., as he lathered ketchup on a fried chicken leg. ''I think he had a very frosty relationship with other players. And he was past his prime. I think Glen Rice is a good addition.''</p>
        <p>John Kay bit hard into a slice of pizza as he was asked about Ewing. Kay grew up in Queens before moving to Madison, N.J., and he considers himself to be as diehard a New York sports fan as anyone. He said that he never warmed to Ewing. He said that Ewing's skills had been declining. It was time for the Knicks to get something for him.</p>
        <p>''You think I give a hoot about him?'' Kay said. ''No. I care as much about him as he cares about me.''</p>
        <p>Spike Lee, the film director, said he had misgivings about the trade but still planned to renew his Knicks season tickets, which cost $1,500 a game for each of his two courtside seats.</p>
        <p>''I got my season ticket the day after Patrick was picked in the lottery, and this is the first day that I've thought about all of the money that I spent,'' said Lee, who attended the news conference at which the Knicks introduced Rice yesterday.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to keep these seats,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Then he paused before adding: ''But I'm going to think about it. I'm going to think about it.''</p>
        <p>Some fans who were glad to see Ewing depart thought that the Knicks did not get the right players in return. They fretted that Luc Longley and Travis Knight would struggle to replace Ewing at center, and they worried that Rice would not mesh well with Knicks shooters like Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston.</p>
        <p>According to Mike Wagner, another fan, the new Knicks combination is not going to work.</p>
        <p>''If they're able to pull off another trade to get Dikembe Mutombo, then it's a good trade,'' said Wagner, of Odenton, Md. ''If they go into the season with Luc Longley and Travis Knight, it's going to be a disaster.''</p>
        <p>Fans who wanted to see Ewing finish his career in New York said the team bungled by trading a legend.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the trade was fair and even,'' said Jay Lowe, who lives in Irvington, N.J. ''He's a New Yorker. He should have stayed right in New York. For them to take that long to decide what to do, well, that made it even worse.''</p>
        <p>Hammonds was also finding it hard to let go of an athlete he admired. ''He gave his heart and soul to play for the Knicks,'' Hammonds said. ''There's just no loyalty within the Knicks organization.''</p>
