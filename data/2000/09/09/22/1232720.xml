        <p>The voodoo curse, the hex on the American softball team, had to be exorcised.

        <p>The voodoo curse, the hex on the American softball team, had to be exorcised. So on Thursday night, after the once-dominant team's third straight loss in the Olympic tournament, Lisa Fernandez suggested a joint cleansing. In their white uniforms, the United States' players jumped in a shower in the athletes' village, stomping around, flooding the floor, in hopes of regaining the form that sustained them through a 112-game winning streak.</p>
        <p>''We were shouting 'Voodoo god!' '' pitcher Lori Harrigan said.</p>
        <p>''We cleansed the bad stuff and the voodoo's gone, and we were ready to rock 'n' roll,'' said Fernandez, who had struck out 25 Australians on Thursday but surrendered a game-winning two-run home run in the 13th inning to Petra Edebone. That placed the United States in desperate need of beating New Zealand today and Italy on Saturday to reach the medal round.</p>
        <p>The cleansing, a team meeting (in dry clothes) and maybe timely hitting and superb pitching cleared away the shock of losing three consecutive games in extra innings and produced a 2-0 defeat of New Zealand today in the regulation seven innings. For the first time since beating Cuba, 3-0, on Monday, the United States scored a run before extra innings.</p>
        <p>''We were in disbelief,'' Dot Richardson, the second baseman, said about the losing streak. ''We're saying, 'We're Down Under and everything is the opposite.' ''</p>
        <p>Harrigan outpitched Gina Weber, giving up one hit and striking out eight New Zealanders through five and a third innings and 85 pitches, when she was replaced by Christa Williams, whose fastballs reached 70 miles an hour. Harrigan's one-hit performance followed her no-hitter against Canada by five days.</p>
        <p>''I felt no pressure,'' Harrigan said. ''I had every confidence we'd hit and I could hold the batters down.''</p>
        <p>After giving up a leadoff walk in the seventh inning, Williams closed the door on New Zealand and set up Saturday's match with Italy.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Brundage put the Americans ahead with a home run to left field in the second off the imposing 6-foot-3-inch Weber. In the fourth, the United States loaded the bases on singles by Brundage and Michele Smith and a walk, but managed only one run when Richardson hit into a forceout.</p>
        <p>The victory provided extraordinary relief to Fernandez, whose brilliance on Thursday, a one-hit game through 10 innings, ended with the nerve-jangling loss to Australia. She also laced a single to left in the fifth inning, her first hit of the tournament after going 0 for 20.</p>
        <p>''I've had a lot of e-mails from friends, two in particular, that were very comforting,'' she said. ''They're Christians, like I am, and they tried to express to me why things happen.''</p>
        <p>The United States now stands 3-3, and if it beats Italy, a chance at defending its gold medal is assured.</p>
        <p>''Right now, I'll take a five-game winning streak over any 112,'' said Richardson, who added, ''It's my birthday and the planets are starting to align.''</p>
