      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Jeroen Krabbe's earnestly schmaltzy film ''Left Luggage'' is so intent on pushing its virtuous agenda that its characters often sound like mouthpieces parroting predigested attitudes in a debate whose uplifting outcome is a foregone conclusion. But like parrots, these mostly sympathetic people have an unfortunate way of repeating themselves. Things that only need to be said once are frequently restated two or three times, and after a while you want to shout: ''We get it! We get it!''</p>
        <p>That agenda has to do with Jewish identity and self-acceptance and facing one's memories of Nazi camps rather than burying them under a facade of homey sweetness and light. Although the movie has some genuinely touching moments and several strong performances, its screenplay by Edwin de Vries veers unsteadily between ham-fisted exposition and cloying sentimentality.</p>

        <p>Jeroen Krabbe's earnestly schmaltzy film ''Left Luggage'' is so intent on pushing its virtuous agenda that its characters often sound like mouthpieces parroting predigested attitudes in a debate whose uplifting outcome is a foregone conclusion. But like parrots, these mostly sympathetic people have an unfortunate way of repeating themselves. Things that only need to be said once are frequently restated two or three times, and after a while you want to shout: ''We get it! We get it!''</p>
        <p>That agenda has to do with Jewish identity and self-acceptance and facing one's memories of Nazi camps rather than burying them under a facade of homey sweetness and light. Although the movie has some genuinely touching moments and several strong performances, its screenplay by Edwin de Vries veers unsteadily between ham-fisted exposition and cloying sentimentality.</p>
        <p>The movie, which opens today at the Quad, shamelessly dotes on a little boy who is so terrified of his strict and forbidding Orthodox father that he wets his pants at the dinner table and is unable to speak. Some tender love and care and regular visits to a duck pond with his spunky new nanny are all it takes to unlock his imprisoned voice, and the first word out of his mouth is a sweetly adorable ''quack.'' But in a movie that doesn't know when to stop being cute, the quacking quickly turns into shtick.</p>
        <p>The story, set in Antwerp in 1972, follows the spiritual awakening of Chaja Silberschmidt (Laura Fraser), the nonreligious 20-year-old daughter of Holocaust survivors. A hedonistic college student, Chaja lives with Gentile roommates, dates a student revolutionary and blithely proclaims that she hates Jews. She rarely visits her parents (Marianne Sagebrecht and Maximilian Schell), who are dealing with the psychic scars of their experience in opposite ways.</p>
        <p>Chaja's mother spends her days baking cakes, weaving blankets and denying the past, while her father is obsessed with retrieving some suitcases containing family memorabilia that he buried in the ground when he fled the Nazis three decades earlier. Because Antwerp has been so physically transformed since the war, few of the old landmarks exist. Yet he doggedly traipses about the city armed with a map and shovel.</p>
        <p>Chaja's awakening begins when she takes a job as nanny for the Kalmans, a Hasidic family that strictly follows Jewish law. Initially the free-spirited Chaja and the thunderously solemn paterfamilias (Mr. Krabbe) clash. But as she develops a friendship with Mrs. Kalman (Isabella Rossellini) and coaxes the couple's mute 4-year-old son, Simcha (Adam Monty), into speaking, she also learns to respect their way of life. Eventually these ties are deepened by a tragic accident that tests their friendship and mutual respect.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rossellini, all pleading eyes and trembling lips, gives one of her most sensitive performances as the harried, fearful Mrs. Kalman, and Ms. Fraser is almost as fine as the free-spirited Chaja, who sheds several layers of arrogance before the story is over.</p>
        <p>But the film's secondary roles are stick figures. Ms. Sagebrecht's and Mr. Schell's roles are so wooden and one-dimensional that you almost expect them to burst into argumentative show tunes when they disagree. And the movie's designated baddie, a scowling, anti-Semitic concierge (David Bradley) who terrorizes Chaja and the Kalmans by barricading the exits to the ground floor of their apartment, is a ludicrous caricature. These stock characters lend the film the cartoonish quality that suggests that under its weepy, soul-searching exterior is a musical comedy struggling to get out.</p>
