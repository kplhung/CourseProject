        <p>The great comeback became official yesterday when Fusaichi Pegasus, winner of the Kentucky Derby and already valued at $60 million, was entered in tomorrow's Jerome Handicap at Belmont Park with high weight of 124 pounds, the inside post position and six rivals eager to knock off racing's wonder horse after a four-month absence.</p>
        <p>''If you're going to catch Fusaichi Pegasus, now's the time,'' said John Kimmel, who trains Hook and Ladder, the speedy but lightly raced challenger. ''He's going to have to run a sub-1:34 mile, and I don't think he's going to be sharp enough to do that.''</p>

        <p>The great comeback became official yesterday when Fusaichi Pegasus, winner of the Kentucky Derby and already valued at $60 million, was entered in tomorrow's Jerome Handicap at Belmont Park with high weight of 124 pounds, the inside post position and six rivals eager to knock off racing's wonder horse after a four-month absence.</p>
        <p>''If you're going to catch Fusaichi Pegasus, now's the time,'' said John Kimmel, who trains Hook and Ladder, the speedy but lightly raced challenger. ''He's going to have to run a sub-1:34 mile, and I don't think he's going to be sharp enough to do that.''</p>
        <p>Neil Drysdale, who trains Fusaichi Pegasus for his Japanese owners, more or less agreed with Kimmel's insight as he prepared to unveil his colt for the first time since he ran second in the Preakness on May 20.</p>
        <p>''I don't say that he is completely fit,'' Drysdale said. ''We're going into this race a week or two shy. But it's not necessary for this horse to win this race. It is just a steppingstone to the Breeders' Cup.''</p>
        <p>Drysdale, a man of few words, would not venture any further agenda for Pegasus, who was withdrawn from the Belmont Stakes in June after he suffered a foot injury. The colt was kept on the sideline all summer while he was becoming a financial heavy hitter.</p>
        <p>Now, with his future as a stallion assured, Pegasus will close out his career as a racehorse in two or possibly three more races: the $150,000 Jerome tomorrow at one mile, the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup three weeks later at a mile and one-quarter and the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at a mile and a quarter at Churchill Downs three weeks after that. But Drysdale still was vague on whether he would run Pegasus in the Gold Cup against Lemon Drop Kid, his chief rival for the title of Horse of the Year.</p>
        <p>''This is a very strong field,'' Drysdale said. ''Running in this race puts us ahead if weather interrupts his training. I look for him to move forward off this race, and it puts him in a position to run again before the Breeders' Cup. Hopefully, he'll regain his spring form, but he might need a race or two.''</p>
        <p>In the spring, Fusaichi Pegasus was hailed as the most exciting horse in a decade. He was bought by Fusao Sekiguchi of Tokyo for $4 million as a yearling, he won the Wood Memorial and the Kentucky Derby, he lost the Preakness to Red Bullet. With a record of five victories and two seconds in seven starts, he was assigned 124 pounds for the Jerome, and once more will have Kent Desormeaux as his rider.</p>
        <p>His greatest threat may be the colt loading next to him in the gate, Albert the Great, who skipped the Triple Crown races but came back to outrun Red Bullet in the Dwyer and then just missed winning the Travers when he lost out to Unshaded.</p>
        <p>''He's loaded with class; he's proved that,'' said Nick Zito, who trains Albert for Tracy Farmer of Lexington, Ky. ''The Jerome is the last 3-year-old race if you're going for anything. It would be nice if he ran in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. That would be the ideal situation.''</p>
        <p>In the second half of a racing doubleheader tomorrow, 11 horses were entered in the $300,000 Vosburgh, a seven-furlong sprint that serves as a springboard for the Breeders' Cup Sprint. Todd Pletcher won the two inside positions in the draw yesterday, getting the rail with Trippi and the No. 2 slot with More Than Ready.</p>
        <p>Trippi has won all four of his starts at seven furlongs and is 2 for 2 at Belmont Park, although he came out of the Amsterdam at Saratoga last month with a bruised left front hoof. More Than Ready, who faces older rivals for the first time, campaigned strongly in the classics this year, then was turned back to a sprint and won his last start, the King's Bishop at Saratoga.</p>
        <p>''We had to decide to try the Breeders' Cup Classic or back up and try the Sprint,'' Pletcher said. ''I think he'll be sharper now coming off a sprint. As for Trippi, he missed about seven days of training. But he's training better now than he has his whole career. He and More Than Ready are running at the right distances.''</p>
