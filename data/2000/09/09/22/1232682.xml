        <p>New York City residents should be thankful the city has been so aggressive in spraying pesticides to kill mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday, rejecting criticism from environmentalists who are suing the city to stop the spraying.</p>
        <p>Pointing to reports of 13 deaths in Israel attributed to West Nile this year, the mayor said New York City has not had a similar experience because of the repeated pesticide spraying this summer.</p>
        <p>Seven deaths in the New York City area were attributed to the virus last year, the first time it was confirmed in the Western Hemisphere. This summer, 11 people in the city have been sickened by the virus, although no deaths have been reported.</p>
        <p>''If you look at the results we have had this year, as compared to last year,'' Mr. Giuliani said at a Queens news conference, it is clear to federal health officials that ''we have saved a lot of lives.''</p>
        <p>A coalition of environmental groups has asked a Federal District Court judge in Manhattan to block the pesticide spraying until a trial can be held to determine if the city has complied with Federal and state laws in the way it used Anvil, a pesticide, and whether its use has complied with federal and state laws.</p>
        <p>At a hearing Wednesday, the environmentalists played a videotape made in Harlem that showed clouds of pesticide falling over young people on a street corner, a vegetable stall, and a pregnant woman in a doorway, said Karl S. Coplan, the lawyer for the environmental groups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that the people who were sprayed with Anvil -- which the city Health Department calls ''relatively nontoxic to humans'' -- had only themselves to blame. ''There is a very simple thing to do here. Get out of the way. Don't stay there and inhale the spray,'' the mayor said, noting that a police car accompanies the pesticide-spraying trucks to warn people.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Coplan said that while a police car is visible on the video, the officers did not directly alert pedestrians and others who were outside. Ultimately, Mr. Coplan added, the city could have prevented West Nile-related deaths this year with a much more limited pesticide campaign.</p>
        <p>''If any lives were saved, they could have been saved with a lot less spraying, a lot less exposure to pesticides,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Federal District Court judge, John S. Martin Jr., has not yet ruled on the request for at least a temporary halt in the spraying, which will likely soon end for the year anyway, as the temperature cools and the mosquito season ends.</p>
