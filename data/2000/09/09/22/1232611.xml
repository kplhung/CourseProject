        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A Sept. 15 editorial was unfair in its criticism of Judge Jed Rakoff for not recusing himself from a lawsuit against Texaco. You said that he attended a conference that was sponsored by a foundation to which Texaco had made donations and that a former chairman of Texaco was one of the speakers. But you did not note certain important facts in Judge Rakoff's legal opinion explaining his reasons for not recusing himself.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A Sept. 15 editorial was unfair in its criticism of Judge Jed Rakoff for not recusing himself from a lawsuit against Texaco. You said that he attended a conference that was sponsored by a foundation to which Texaco had made donations and that a former chairman of Texaco was one of the speakers. But you did not note certain important facts in Judge Rakoff's legal opinion explaining his reasons for not recusing himself.</p>
        <p>The conference was held more than a year after Judge Rakoff had dismissed the case. (It was later remanded to him after the conference.)</p>
        <p>Judge Rakoff was unaware that any of the foundation's financing came from Texaco. Moreover, the financial support for this conference came from other charitable institutions not involved in the litigation.</p>
        <p>The former chairman of Texaco did not address the merits of the case.</p>
        <p>Judge Rakoff's decision not to recuse himself was absolutely correct.</p>
        <p>ROBERT B. FISKE JR.  New York, Sept. 21, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer, a former colleague of Judge Rakoff, was United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, 1976-80.</p>
