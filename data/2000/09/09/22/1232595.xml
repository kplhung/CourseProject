        <p>For effect, or perhaps just because he can, the fabled Cuban boxing champion Felix Savon enters a boxing ring not by dipping between the ropes, but by lifting one leg at a time over the top rope with the ease of someone stepping into a warm bath.</p>
        <p>The 6-foot-6 1/2-inch Savon will not stoop to begin a bout. The intimidation begins with the entrance.</p>
        <p>The American heavyweight Michael Bennett, who faces Savon next week in what amounts to a gold medal fight in the second round of the Olympic boxing tournament, does not have a trick entrance. He wasn't impressed with Savon's, either.</p>
        <p>''He's a big man, he can do what he wants but age catches up with everyone,'' Bennett said of the 33-year-old Savon, the two-time defending Olympic champion. ''Sometimes you don't think you've lost a step, but you have.''</p>
        <p>It appeared today that Bennett and his American coach, Tom Mustin, have their own mind games planned to counteract the mystique and legend surrounding Savon as their featured bout approaches Tuesday afternoon. Today, after Bennett and Savon each easily advanced to the second round, in unsubtle ways, Bennett and Mustin cast Savon, the six-time world champion, as aging and past his prime.</p>
        <p>''He looks a little vulnerable,'' Mustin said after watching Savon's easy defeat of Rasmus Ojemaye of Nigeria. ''I thought the Nigerian wobbled him a little with left hands. He doesn't look like he takes a punch the way he used to. Somebody is creeping up on him.''</p>
        <p>Bennett, meanwhile, was visited in the locker room by Evander Holyfield after his first-round victory over Wojciech Bartnik of Poland. Holyfield also gave Bennett his scouting report on how to beat Savon.</p>
        <p>''He gave me a few tips,'' Bennett said. ''Hopefully, I'll be able to capitalize on them. But I can't give you those secrets.''</p>
        <p>Savon did not talk to reporters after his fight and his longtime coach, Alcides Sagarra, maintained the news media silence he has kept since arriving in Sydney.</p>
        <p>But the Savon-Bennett fight is at the heart of the continuing rivalry between the American and Cuban boxers, who have been the class of the Olympic boxing tournament. Only one Cuban, 20-year-old Roberto Guerra Rivera, and one American, Dante Craig, a welterweight, have lost.</p>
        <p>The byplay between Savon and Bennett has been building for nearly a year since Savon refused to fight Bennett in the finals of the 1999 world championships. Savon, on Sagarra's urging, was protesting a controversial decision against a Cuban teammate earlier in the competition. That decision was later overturned, but Savon had already forsaken his world title as Bennett won in a walkover.</p>
        <p>''That was really disappointing, to not get the chance to face him right then,'' Bennett said. ''That's why all I want is another chance.''</p>
        <p>The plain-spoken Mustin said he was not sure how Bennett was going to fare against Savon in their bout last year. The 29-year-old Bennett, who spent seven years in prison for armed robbery, has been competing as an amateur boxer for only two years.</p>
        <p>''Michael was still pretty raw at times last year,'' Mustin said. ''He's much more prepared now.''</p>
        <p>There really is no secret to what Bennett will have to do to win in Tuesday's quarterfinal bout. Savon uses his long reach to keep opponents from scoring against him and follows a pesky but innocuous left jab with a thunderous right hand. Bennett, who is 6 inches shorter than Savon, but weighs the same as the Cuban at 201 pounds, will have to get inside with short choppy counterpunches, but first he will have to deflect Savon's attacks.</p>
        <p>''Michael will have to keep his hands high, not be intimidated and think through the whole fight,'' Mustin said.</p>
        <p>When Bennett was not discussing tactics for Savon today, he was recounting his highly unique path to the Olympics. In 1993, Bennett began his sentence in the Illinois penitentiary system for the after-hours robbery of a Toys ''R'' Us Inc. warehouse in his native Chicago.</p>
        <p>Dubbed the Toy Store Bandit, Bennett, who had been a high school and junior college football star, was tutored in boxing by three fellow inmates who were serving life sentences. He said today that he knew they were now pulling for him.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure they're happy for me,'' he said. ''I know those guys are rooting for me, but it's hard because it's against the rules for me to talk to them or be in any contact with them. Some of those men will never come home because they made mistakes that cost a lot more than mine. We all make mistakes, some just cost more than others.''</p>
        <p>PUNCH LINES</p>
        <p>The welterweight DANTE CRAIG became the first American Olympic boxer to lose when BULENT ULUSOY of Turkey, a three-time European champion, outpointed Craig in a second-round bout, 9-4.</p>
        <p>Craig, a 22-year-old from Cincinnati, was a surprise entrant on the United States team. He had retired from boxing in 1998 after his mother died of breast cancer, but his comeback included a series of upset victories this spring as he qualified for the American team. Earlier this year, Craig's 3-month-old son, Dante Jr., also died.</p>
        <p>Earlier, the American bantamweight CLARENCE VINSON advanced to the third round with a 12-7 victory over TAALAIBEK KADIRALIEV of Kyrgyzstan.</p>
