        <p>The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey said today that it would appeal a state judge's refusal to let a lesbian hyphenate her surname to include her partner's. The group said that while issuing his ruling last month, the judge explained that he was denying the request in order to avoid giving the impression that the court officially recognized same-sex marriages.</p>
        <p>Legal experts and lesbian and gay rights advocates said the Aug. 10 ruling, by Judge Anthony J. Iuliani of State Superior Court here, was out of step with New Jersey law, which allows name changes for virtually any reason other than to perpetrate fraud or avoid criminal prosecution or creditors. And they said they believed that the decision was the first in the United States denying a name change to a same-sex partner.</p>

        <p>The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey said today that it would appeal a state judge's refusal to let a lesbian hyphenate her surname to include her partner's. The group said that while issuing his ruling last month, the judge explained that he was denying the request in order to avoid giving the impression that the court officially recognized same-sex marriages.</p>
        <p>Legal experts and lesbian and gay rights advocates said the Aug. 10 ruling, by Judge Anthony J. Iuliani of State Superior Court here, was out of step with New Jersey law, which allows name changes for virtually any reason other than to perpetrate fraud or avoid criminal prosecution or creditors. And they said they believed that the decision was the first in the United States denying a name change to a same-sex partner.</p>
        <p>''We've been around for 20 years, and never heard of a case like this one,'' said Shannon Minter, senior staff attorney for the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco. ''It takes some creativity to come up with a new way to discriminate against lesbian and gay people.''</p>
        <p>The case involves Jill Bacharach, 32, a trained social worker employed as a therapist who has lived with a woman in Essex County for a year and half. ''We're both so happy, and we both know we found the person we were meant to be with,'' said Ms. Bacharach, who said that adding her partner's name to her own was ''a way to tie each other to one another.''</p>
        <p>She would not identify her 42-year-old partner, who she said planned to change her name soon as well. She said that they were joined Sept. 10 in a civil union in Vermont, the only state that grants same-sex partners legal status similar to that of married couples.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bacharach said she had not planned to make her partner's sex an issue last month during a hearing before Judge Iuliani when her lawyer, James P. Sieradzki, went through the standard procedure of asking her why she wanted to change her name. She said she wanted to form ties with her partner, although she didn't specify her partner's gender. But she said it became obvious she was a lesbian, because her partner was one of only two people seated in the gallery, and the other was also a woman.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bacharach said the judge ''took his glasses off and sort of scowled at me and said, 'Why do you need to do this?' It was very upsetting.''</p>
        <p>Judge Iuliani did not return phone calls to his office today. There was no written decision in the case, and J.C. Salyer, the A.C.L.U. staff lawyer who is handling the appeal, said he was still awaiting a transcript of the hearing.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Bacharach and Mr. Sieradzki, who is also working on the appeal, said the judge told them that he did not want to appear to be recognizing same-sex marriages. Ms. Bacharach also said that Judge Iuliani suggested, in a mocking tone, that if they wanted to get married, she and her partner go to Vermont.</p>
        <p>Judge Iuliani, 74, retired from the bench in 1995 at the mandatory retirement age of 70, but because of a court backlog has been on call in the civil division of Superior Court since January 1998.</p>
        <p>Mark S. Guralnik, a lawyer and author of ''Guralnik's N.J. Family Law Annotated,'' said it was legally irrelevant why someone wants to change her name, as long as it is not for fraudulent purposes.</p>
