        <p>Ten weeks ago Damir Arbanas hopped a plane from Croatia to New York to begin what he thought would be a better life, waiting tables aboard a cruise ship, the Big Red Boat II. He dreamed of seeing the world and racking up fat tips from wealthy Americans.</p>
        <p>But his dream and his ship have been grounded. A federal judge in Manhattan detained the ship last week because Mr. Arbanas's employer, Premier Cruise Lines, the company that chartered the ship, is battling with supply companies who say they are not being paid.</p>
        <p>Eight suppliers of fuel and maritime services have filed lawsuits and have paid the government $6,500 each to cover the costs of detaining the ship at a Staten Island pier, a lawyer for the United States Justice Department said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Arbanas, 31, and more than 200 other crew members -- many of them with big dreams from their homeland, places like Hungary, the Philippines and Costa Rica -- sit and wait for paychecks and word about their future. ''I came here to work,'' Mr. Arbanas said yesterday, as he and other frustrated workers, mostly men, piled off the ship to stroll in Staten Island. ''I don't want to sit here, day after day. Nobody tell us nothing. We don't even know who it is we work for now.''</p>
        <p>The ship arrived in New York last weekend after a trip to Canada. Passengers on that cruise were taken to Manhattan, but the workers stayed aboard while the ship went to Staten Island to dock.</p>
        <p>It is unclear who is speaking for Premier Cruise Lines. The law firm that is listed as representing the line  said it was not involved in the case, and company officials were not available at the Staten Island pier yesterday.</p>
        <p>Phone calls to the company's office in Port Canaveral, Fla., heard a recording apologizing to customers for the company's financial problems and saying that refunds to passengers would be forthcoming.</p>
        <p>David Nourse, a lawyer for the Big Red Boat (TWO) Limited, which owns the ship and leased it to Premier, said his clients were trying to reach a deal with Premier's disgruntled suppliers that would put the ship back at sea as early as this weekend. Those crew members who work directly for the owners have been paid, he said.</p>
        <p>But he added that the owner cannot continue to meet its obligation if the ship has to sit idle much longer. ''The vessel must be released in order to find other business to make up for the losses.''</p>
        <p>A deal between the owner and the suppliers is not likely to resolve much for people who work for Premier, like Mr. Arbanas. Mr. Nourse said his clients had no plans to pay or hire Premier's crew members.</p>
        <p>The federal Immigration and Naturalization Service said the law gave workers who are not citizens 29 days to find new work aboard another cruise ship or to find the money to pay their way back home.</p>
        <p>Those who would like to return say they cannot because they don't have the means.</p>
        <p>''I have two kids and a wife,'' said Reuben Parkinson, a 25-year-old kitchen worker from Limon, Costa Rica. ''My money, I send home to them.'' The cruise line is obligated to send him home, he said. ''That is the least I expect for the way we have been left here with no news.''</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the I.N.S. said there was no plan to help the workers yet because, technically, they are  still employed.</p>
        <p>One after another, scores of the workers approached reporters yesterday asking if they knew what was to happen to them. Many simply left the ship with bowed heads, on their way to the library to contact their loved ones via the Internet, or to a local shopping mall to pass even more time.</p>
        <p>Many of the workers said that they would like to find work elsewhere, but that there are few jobs on cruise ships, especially since Premier has also left other workers from other ships stranded without work.</p>
        <p>''The best thing would be to move on,'' Mr. Arbanas said. ''But so many others are now like me, looking for the good job. I have no choice but to wait.''</p>
        <p>He said he signed on to work aboard Big Red for 10 months. He had hoped that the job would help him save enough money to return to Croatia and start his own business. With tips, he said, he made $1,200 to $2,000 a month.</p>
        <p>At least one day, he said, he hopes to use the little money he has saved to return home. But he said it would  be only a temporary solution. ''I could go back, but I want a good job for a better life. It's easier over here.''</p>
