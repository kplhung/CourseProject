        <p>New York now begins life without Patrick Ewing, but with Glen Rice, Luc Longley and Travis Knight. It may prove to be problematical.</p>
        <p>CHRIS BROUSSARD</p>
        <p>1. CAN THE KNICKS DEFEND? -- Perennially one of the league's toughest defensive teams, the Knicks will now be a softer unit. Patrick Ewing was no longer a feared defender, but teams will salivate at the idea of penetrating the lane against Luc Longley and Travis Knight. And throughout his 11-year career, Glen Rice's idea of good defense has been to score 25 points to his opponent's 22. With Allan Houston already being suspect defensively, the Knicks' vaunted perimeter defense could be a thing of the past.</p>

        <p>New York now begins life without Patrick Ewing, but with Glen Rice, Luc Longley and Travis Knight. It may prove to be problematical.</p>
        <p>CHRIS BROUSSARD</p>
        <p>1. CAN THE KNICKS DEFEND? -- Perennially one of the league's toughest defensive teams, the Knicks will now be a softer unit. Patrick Ewing was no longer a feared defender, but teams will salivate at the idea of penetrating the lane against Luc Longley and Travis Knight. And throughout his 11-year career, Glen Rice's idea of good defense has been to score 25 points to his opponent's 22. With Allan Houston already being suspect defensively, the Knicks' vaunted perimeter defense could be a thing of the past.</p>
        <p>2. WHO'LL GRAB A REBOUND? -- With Ewing averaging 9.7 rebounds per game, the Knicks ranked 28th in overall rebounding and last in offensive rebounding last season. How low will they go with Longley (4.5 rebounds per game) and Knight (2.0) in his place? Marcus Camby, who averaged 7.8 rebounds last season, could be the answer, but his durability, particularly if he has to play center, is always in question.</p>
        <p>3. THE BIG BACKCOURT? -- What has been an occasional treat the past two seasons could become commonplace in order to accommodate Allan Houston, Latrell Sprewell and Glen Rice. A nice thought, but who would handle the ball?</p>
        <p>4. ANOTHER MOVE? -- Despite their cries to the contrary, the Knicks appear to have no choice but to try to trade for a front-line center or top-flight power forward. With Rice aboard, they can now afford to move Houston or Sprewell to add strength inside.</p>
        <p>5. VAN GUNDY'S GREATEST CHALLENGE? -- After growing accustomed to having a dominant low-post scorer, he will have to adjust and devise a plan that will exploit the strengths and hide the deficiencies of the smaller, sleeker Knicks.</p>
        <p>6. RUNNING IN THE EAST? -- What used to be the league's most rugged conference has lightened up considerably, undergoing a speedy and athletic makeover this summer. Besides Miami's Alonzo Mourning, there is not a dominant and intimidating offensive center or power forward in the conference. Maybe the Knicks, adopting the Ewingless style of play that got them to the Finals in 1999, can run past conference contenders like Indiana, Orlando and Milwaukee, all of whom lack great personnel inside. Bulked-up Miami, of course, will be a different story, but being second best in the East looks pretty good right now.</p>
