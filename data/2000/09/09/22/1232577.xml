        <p>THE Met's ''Art and the Empire City'' is what Cecil B. De Mille would have come up with if he were making an epic about ''Antiques Roadshow.''</p>
        <p>(With Matt Damon and Ben Affleck cast as Leigh and Leslie Keno, television's furniture-dealing brothers: ''So, Mr. de Montebello, any guess about a price at auction on your ebonized mahogany, gilded secretary-bookcase with the brass ornaments and glass doors? You shouldn't have replaced the curtains on the doors, but considering what you paid in 1960, would you be surprised to hear half a million dollars?'')</p>
        <p>Gigantic, amusing, only marginally an art exhibition, this show, which is uncharacteristic of the Met, is really an ostentatious illustrated history lesson via hundreds of pieces of old crockery, silverware, etchings, mother-of-pearl folding fans, paintings, daguerreotypes, rosewood fire screens with flower decorations in needlepoint and other curious objects made, sold or displayed in the city or that otherwise passed through between 1825 and 1861.</p>
        <p>An event custom-designed for our own acquisitive age, it's certainly the only time that a 19th-century brown ceramic water cooler and a six-sided pitcher with pictures of the presidential candidate William Henry Harrison on it have been presented like the treasures of Pharaoh's palace in ''The Ten Commandments.''</p>
        <p>The point is that during the antebellum years New York began to become, well, New York, America's megalopolis and an international crossroads. The Erie Canal was finished, the plan to grid the streets all over Manhattan was under way, Central Park was mapped out, and the city (physically, ethnically, culturally, commercially) started to resemble what it is now.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers, real estate-obsessed, will no doubt derive particular pleasure perusing the 1836 topographical map at the very start of the exhibition to see the hills and streams that used to be where their peanut-size apartments are today. Manhattan was being flattened then to make way for the new grid, churchyards demolished, waterways blocked, old streets plowed up and replaced along with the buildings lining them. Photographs of the city show Fifth Avenue as still a partly empty stretch of separate houses receding toward infinity, Union Square as cobblestoned and without anyone in it except for a few people posing before a brand new statue of George Washington.</p>
        <p>These pictures exist with etchings and other prints like Thomas Benecke's view outside P. T. Barnum's museum: a snowy mess of horses and pedestrians in little bonnets and top hats, conforming more to popular accounts of the city as a vast scrum, a ''river deep and wide of live, perspiring humanity,'' as one diarist at the time put it, so dense that somebody even proposed erecting a glass-paved mezzanine above the sidewalk to relieve the crowding.</p>
        <p>We hold these two visions in mind, the city incomplete and the city overrun, veering toward chaos. They still pretty much define New York. Photographers like Victor Prevost, who arrived in America in 1848 from France, specialized in views that stressed the aspect of instability and incompleteness. He showed the city as a place always unmaking what it had just made, and this idea as much as any other became embedded in the civic psyche: New York as a work in progress. The city that never sleeps.</p>
        <p>Prevost's work was comparatively obscure, but photographers like Charles DeForest Fredericks, through his commercial views of New York, and Mathew Brady, through his portraits, significantly affected the city in the antebellum years. According to one account 200 photo studios had opened in New York by 1858, producing pictures that among other things spurred the demand for illustrated newspapers and magazines, paving the way for New York to become the country's media Goliath. Photographs helped Olmsted and Vaux sell their plan for Central Park, providing ''before'' shots to contrast with the paintings they had commissioned to show what the site would look like after their work was finished.</p>
        <p>Photography also dovetailed with the new concept of the city as spectacle, as an endless producer of exceptional, theatrical images, a shifting who's who of people and things. Not coincidentally the most memorable pictures in the exhibition include daguerreotypes, like the ones of Walt Whitman, Barnum and Samuel F. B. Morse, and other famous photographs, like Brady's carte-de-visite of Lincoln. Subject and medium combine to encapsulate the era.</p>
        <p>In 1825 the city's population topped 125,000. By 1860 it had nearly reached 815,000. At that point just under half of New Yorkers were foreign born, most immigrants having arrived after 1845. Nearly one-third of the city was Irish, 15 percent German; only 1.5 percent were blacks, down from 10 percent in 1820. ''The great phenomenon of the age is the growth of great cities,'' a writer in Putnam's Monthly stated in 1855. And New York ''is greater than Paris or Constantinople, and will evidently be hereafter (in the 20th century, if not sooner) greater than London.''</p>
        <p>All this naturally meant several things: a housing crunch, ethnic tensions, a demand for amusements, jails, stores, parks, reservoirs, museums: everything that goes along with a metropolis.</p>
        <p>And you can see in the show the city's aspiration to look important: in the design for buildings like the United States Customs House, the Merchants' Exchange, fancy rows like La Grange Terrace and Lafayette Place (now Astor Place) and in a whole range of opulent furniture, often parroting Europe, by designers like Duncan Phyfe and Gustave Herter. The enormous Egyptian-style reservoir on the site of what is now the New York Public Library at 42nd Street was probably the most extravagant declaration of civic magnitude.</p>
        <p>But the test of a great city was not just how big it was or how grand its architecture looked. The real test had to do with urbanity, a quality of mind that antebellum New York, it seems, was trying desperately to acquire.</p>
        <p>This is the beauty part of the exhibition. It presents paintings by Thomas Cole, John Trumbull, Asher B. Durand and Morse (his big portrait of Lafayette with the busts of Franklin and Washington), and it documents places like the National Academy of Design and the Crystal Palace (on the site of what is now Bryant Park), which began to institutionalize culture in New York.</p>
        <p>The Crystal Palace was an immense glass exhibition hall, modeled after London's Crystal Palace. Until it burned down in 1858, it served as a combination of museum and department store, a vast public attraction mixing edification with consumption. Disastrously. It was a financial flop. Even Barnum, who briefly took it over, couldn't make it work. But it was a perfect symbol of antebellum New York's gigantic ambition and conflicted personality.</p>
        <p>New York was defined as increasingly urbane by the presence of the National Academy or the new art galleries, like Goupil's and the Dusseldorf, which were importing European paintings and sculptures (some of them in the show). But it was defined just as much on the low end by proliferating freak shows, fireworks displays, minstrel theaters and penny entertainments.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers could pay a quarter to visit stuffy establishments like Thomas Jefferson Bryan's Gallery of Christian Art on Broadway at 13th Street, where the admission charge was meant to preserve ''that quiet and elegant taste,'' as one writer at the time put it, or they could fork over the same money (children half-price) at a place called the New York Society Library to see the famed Aztec Children. (''Absolutely a New and Unique Race of Mankind, a most Extraordinary and Inexplicable Phenomena, such as never have been seen by Civilized Nations,'' promised the advertisement.)</p>
        <p>Moralists railed of course. But most New Yorkers just ignored the distinction between high and low. Commercial museums still mixed art with stuffed animals and bearded women. A. T. Stewart's, the dry goods palace that opened at Broadway and Chambers Street in 1823, was in many ways the most spectacular and art-filled place in the city. Free of charge, New Yorkers could ogle luxury objects from around the world that they couldn't see anywhere else. Art and commerce linked, a condition still shaping the city's culture.</p>
        <p>Dell Upton, an architectural historian, summing up in the show's catalog Stewart's history and other local phenomena, stresses the particular significance of the plan for a grid of streets. It was, he writes, ''the embodiment of an economically informed vision of urban society'' because it ''envisioned commerce as an all-encompassing, impersonal, systematic exchange of commodities rather than, as it had traditionally been regarded (and still was by many small traders), a series of discrete, highly personal, morally tinged relationships.''</p>
        <p>In other words, the grid was unsentimental, open-ended, utilitarian. And democratic. It was a gigantic blank sheet on which the city could draw its future.</p>
        <p>Which is what happened during the years covered by the show. Much of the city was sketched in. But with plenty still left up for grabs, a heroic leap of faith in New York's capacity to accommodate change.</p>
        <p>Come to think of it, epic, too.</p>
