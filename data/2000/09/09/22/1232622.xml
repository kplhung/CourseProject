        <p>The Federal Communications Commission, seeking to win political support for its proposal to issue licenses for hundreds of new low-power FM radio stations, has completed new regulations that permit larger stations to raise complaints about any signal interference from the start-ups, agency officials said today.</p>
        <p>They said the commission approved the new rules in principle on Wednesday in an effort to defuse the criticism of the plan by National Public Radio and the nation's leading commercial broadcasters.</p>
        <p>The rules are expected to be released as early as Friday. They come in response to criticism of the low-power radio plan from broadcasters and members of Congress, who support legislation to curb the program, which would issue licenses to groups like schools, churches and community organizations.</p>
        <p>While F.C.C. officials expected strong opposition from the National Association of Broadcasters, they appeared surprised earlier this year by the criticism from National Public Radio. Both NPR and other broadcasters have said the new stations could create significant interference with existing stations, although NPR has not taken as hard a line against the low-power radio plan as the commercial stations.</p>
        <p>F.C.C. officials say their engineering studies concluded that there would be no significant interference and that the issue was a smoke screen to mask concerns about new competition for existing stations.</p>
        <p>Members of the House and Senate have introduced measures to kill or sharply scale back the low-power radio plan, a major initiative of William E. Kennard, the chairman of the F.C.C.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard said today that he continued to believe there would be no interference from the new stations and that the new order was an important way of assuring the critics that there would be no problems.</p>
        <p>''We have gone the extra mile to address their concerns,'' he said in an interview. ''This order will put to rest any question about whether these services can coexist.''</p>
        <p>He said organizations in 20 states had already sent the agency more than 1,200 applications for small FM stations. If Congress does not intervene, the agency could begin to grant licenses by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>After heavy lobbying against the plan by the nation's largest broadcasters, the House overwhelmingly adopted the legislation opposing the program in April. Similar legislation may reach the floor of the Senate before it adjourns next month. White House officials have said the president and vice president support the low-power proposal and oppose the legislation.</p>
        <p>The new rules would make it easier for existing stations to file complaints about interference and would specifically protect the radio reading services for the blind by not permitting any low-power stations to broadcast on nearby frequencies.</p>
        <p>The rules come in response to a request by NPR that the agency reconsider its decision in January to issue the licenses.</p>
        <p>NPR executives who have endorsed some of the measures introduced in Congress to curb the program said today that they could not comment on the merits of the new F.C.C. order without first studying the details and discussing them with affiliate stations.</p>
        <p>''We believe they can be compatible services,'' said Kevin Klose, the president of NPR. ''Intuitively, they are complementary services if there are adequate safeguards in place.''</p>
        <p>Because the new order does not address all of NPR's complaints about the low-power program, it may continue to raise objections.</p>
        <p>F.C.C. officials said, for instance, that the new rules would not address a request by NPR that the agency protect some of the signals of the strings of radio transmitters, known as translators, that are used to extend the broadcast signal of a station, primarily in rural and remote areas .</p>
        <p>''Public radio stations in rural communities have expressed serious reservations about not being protected,'' Mr. Klose said.</p>
        <p>But officials at the F.C.C. said the agency was not willing to adopt any rules that would require a low-power station to relinquish its license if a larger station wanted to install a new translator.</p>
        <p>Just how valuable the airwaves are becoming was demonstrated today with the conclusion of an F.C.C. auction for a small piece of the spectrum that generated more than five times the amount of money that officials had projected.</p>
        <p>The agency reported that the auction, which had been projected to raise about $100 million, raised more than $519 million from the nine winners. The top bidder was Nextel, at $337 million for 37 licenses, followed by Pegasus Communications, which will pay $91 million for 31 licenses.</p>
        <p>Under an arrangement adopted by the F.C.C. to encourage a more efficient use of the airwaves, those companies will receive licenses to act as ''band managers,'' leasing portions of the spectrum that they won to third parties and commercial users for applications like dispatching services.</p>
