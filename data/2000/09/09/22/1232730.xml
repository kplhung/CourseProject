        <p>Saying that delays have increased to an ''unacceptable level'' at La Guardia Airport, the Port Authority has told airlines that they cannot add more flights during the airport's busiest and most popular flying times, in the morning and evening.</p>
        <p>The ban is intended to prevent what airport managers see as the gridlock that could result from as many as 600 more takeoffs and landings a day. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the region's three largest airports, foresees such an increase under a federal law passed last year to expand service between New York and smaller cities by creating more slots for smaller regional jets that hold up to 71 passengers.</p>
        <p>The action is one of the more public acknowledgments to date of a problem that has begun to plague many airports around the country: growth in air traffic outpacing the ability of airports to handle it.</p>
        <p>Port Authority officials said that delays at La Guardia Airport had grown to an ''unacceptable level'' and that they hoped the ban on additional rush-hour service would force the airlines to come to the table and decide how to allocate flights more efficiently throughout the day. The new flights could increase traffic at La Guardia by 50 percent on the busiest days.</p>
        <p>Other airports have also tried to impose restrictions on airlines to manage congestion.</p>
        <p>In New York, airline executives immediately questioned whether the Port Authority has the power to place such restrictions on new flights, a move that the agency has never taken before and one that no other major United States airport has ever tried so stridently.</p>
        <p>''You can't put a moratorium on an airport,'' said Greg Brenneman, the president of Continental Airlines, which plans to expand regional service at La Guardia. ''Nobody has ever done that before.''</p>
        <p>John Kennedy, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines, said, ''Delta has made considerable investment in new aircraft and other areas to provide services that are in great demand, and we have concerns about the legality of the port's decision to block these services.''</p>
        <p>The Port Authority does not have direct control over the number of flights at La Guardia.</p>
        <p>But Port Authority officials said they believed that, as the landlord of the airport, the agency had the authority to act to prevent flight delays at La Guardia, already among the worst in the country, from becoming worse. The ban, which will begin Oct. 1., is to be temporary, officials said, but they said they did not know when it would be lifted.</p>
        <p>The ban will affect a small number of flights that airlines have already scheduled after Oct. 1., as well as many that have not yet been scheduled. Port Authority officials would not say yesterday how many flights would be affected or which flights those were. The flights do not necessarily have to be canceled, but must be moved to other times, prompting strong complaints from airlines.</p>
        <p>Officials from the federal Department of Transportation, which would probably be the agency to decide whether the Port Authority is authorized to impose such a ban, said yesterday that they were reviewing the action. A spokesman for the agency said there was no formal process in place for mediating disputes between airlines and airport managers over flight restrictions.</p>
        <p>The federal law allowing more regional service at La Guardia was the first step the Federal Aviation Administration had made in 30 years to ease the rationing of landing and takeoff slots at La Guardia, as well as at Kennedy International Airport, limits that were put in place to keep the busy airports from being overwhelmed by airplanes.</p>
        <p>Since the law went into effect, airlines have moved aggressively to take advantage of it and most have planned to add regional service during the early morning and evening hours when passengers, especially business travelers, want to fly.</p>
        <p>But in a letter dated Tuesday and sent to the airlines that serve La Guardia, Robert E. Boyle, the executive director of the Port Authority, said that during those times, jet traffic already meets or exceeds the airport's capacity.</p>
        <p>Since the passage of the federal law, airlines have already added almost 200 more regional flights a day,  Mr. Boyle said, and they have ''announced potentially more flights which bear no relation to capacity.''</p>
        <p>''Even during ideal weather conditions, runway configurations and air traffic control patterns, the level of delay has increased to an unacceptable level,'' Mr. Boyle wrote, adding: ''Requests to the airlines from the Port Authority that flights be rescheduled to other times of the day when there may be some additional capacity have been disregarded, thus necessitating the above action.''</p>
        <p>The ban would prohibit airlines from adding new regional flights in the morning, between 8 and 9:59, and in the evening, between 5:30 and 8:29.</p>
        <p>Both the airlines and the airport's managers sought yesterday to avoid turning the issue into a confrontation, and suggested that they might be able to use the moratorium to work on ways to ease La Guardia's rush-hour congestion.</p>
        <p>It will not be easy. Even before the increase in regional service was allowed, loopholes in the flight restrictions allowed the amount of air traffic, and crowding, to increase. Last year, for example, there were 371,000 takeoffs and landings of all types of planes -- big jets, commuter jets, private jets and propeller planes. This was up from 358,157 in 1998 and 345,647 in 1996. And because most airlines want to schedule new flights during the times most in demand by passengers, the airport often ends up snarled by traffic jams during those hours, with lines of jets waiting an hour or more on the taxiway to take off.</p>
        <p>It is a fact readily acknowledged by the airlines. ''La Guardia has turned into a parking lot,'' said Mr. Brenneman, Continental's president. But he added that when the federal government opened new slots for regional service, airlines were compelled by competition to rush to fill as many of them as possible. And if the airlines scheduled the new flights for the middle of the day or later at night, they would probably be unable to fill the planes.</p>
        <p>Other airports around the country have also tried to impose restrictions on airlines to manage congestion.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, San Francisco International said it would limit the number of small airplanes used by United Airlines and its commuter line to take passengers from smaller California cities to San Francisco for connections to longer flights. The airline and the airport came to a compromise, shifting some of United's regular flights to help ease congestion in peak periods and allow it to  keep its smaller airplanes in use.</p>
        <p>One solution being considered by the Port Authority to contend with the problem of overscheduling at La Guardia is changing the way airlines are charged for using the airport -- increasing fees, for example, during peak hours to discourage airlines from scheduling so many flights during those hours.</p>
