        <p>China 2000 Fine Art</p>
        <p>5 East 57th Street</p>
        <p>Through Oct. 7</p>
        <p>China 2000 has long specialized in evoking the rarefied world of the Chinese scholar-artist in a gallery context, and it does with particular success in this handsome, beautifully installed selection of small-scale pieces.</p>
        <p>Painting and calligraphy are mostly confined to the hand-held format of the curved paper fan. Sometimes created for friends as glorified party favors, such paintings were based on the pretty concept that as the fan was unfolded, vistas and poems were revealed. The examples in the show range from a radiant scene of a mountaintop pavilion by the 17th-century artist Zheng Zhong to a 1920's painting by Qi Baishi of breeze-tickled wisteria, with blossoms all red and forget-me-not blue.</p>
        <p>At least as characterful, and no less in touch with nature, are implements for the studio table. A cylindrical brush pot carrying the signature of its owner, the Qing scholar-artist Shen Bai, is a historical standout. But the visual star is another brush holder carved from a single piece of bamboo. Rust-colored, formed in a pattern of concentric rings that produce an off-kilter, slumped-cake effect, this utilitarian charmer presents a challenge to even the most disciplined scholar-artist: who can concentrate on anything else when it's around?</p>
