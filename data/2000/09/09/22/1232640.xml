        <p>The leader of the Serbian Radical Party, Vojislav Seselj, made a bitter attack today on ''the undemocratic propaganda methods'' of the political coalition of President Slobodan Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic -- a coalition Mr. Seselj has supported in both the federal and Serbian parliaments.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The leader of the Serbian Radical Party, Vojislav Seselj, made a bitter attack today on ''the undemocratic propaganda methods'' of the political coalition of President Slobodan Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic -- a coalition Mr. Seselj has supported in both the federal and Serbian parliaments.</p>
        <p>''The elections have been prepared in a completely irregular fashion,'' Mr. Seselj said at a news conference, saying that if Sunday's voting results are faked, ''it will further destabilize the country.'' He said that if the elections were fair, it was ''absolutely impossible'' for any candidate to win the presidency in the first round, as many opposition leaders believe Mr. Milosevic intends to do, fairly or otherwise.</p>
        <p>Without any apparent irony, Mr. Seselj accused Mr. Milosevic and his wife of ''turning state media into their propaganda outlets,'' of ''instrumentalizing the army and the police for political ends,'' and of ''using all the financial resources of the state for their campaign,'' including the spending of reserves from the state bank. ''There's nothing anyone can do about it,'' he said. ''They are above the law.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Seselj and his Radical Party are ultranationalists and ambitious for power, and it has been clear for some time that Mr. Milosevic wants to use these elections to cut back Mr. Seselj's influence. In previous elections, Mr. Milosevic has given Mr. Seselj and his party considerable air time, in order to create a coalition partner on the patriotic right. This time, Mr. Seselj complained today, his party is being shut out of its fair share of time on state television.</p>
        <p>The Radicals and the Serbian Renewal Movement -- hitherto the largest opposition party, led by Mr. Seselj's sometime friend, sometime enemy Vuk Draskovic -- look to be the main losers from this election. In the byzantine world of Serbian politics, they are already talking about cooperating in the Serbian Parliament, where the two parties control a majority of the seats and could combine to call early elections.</p>
        <p>Despite his sharp criticism of Mr. Milosevic today, however, Mr. Seselj did not rule out any form of coalition after the election, so long as it is fair, he said.</p>
        <p>But it was possible to hear his attacks as a warning to Mr. Milosevic that the Radicals can be dangerous in the vital Serbian Parliament if their desires are ignored.</p>
        <p>At another news conference today, Nikola Sainovic, deputy prime minister and a spokesman for Mr. Milosevic's party, said the election campaign ''has been very correct,'' adding that ''all parties got time'' on state television. He said the election would be free and fair, but he warned that NATO countries, helping the opposition to organize, ''will participate in the stealing of the election.''</p>
        <p>He said he expected the Milosevic coalition to win ''an absolute majority,'' both in parliamentary elections and in the first round of presidential elections.</p>
        <p>In an instance of the way the state-owned press can manipulate the news, the tabloid Vecerni Novosti today printed a computer-distorted photograph of the crowd at Mr. Milosevic's rally on Wednesday at Berane, in Montenegro. The photograph has clearly been extended by at least a third of its length by adding another photograph of the same crowd taken at a different moment. Comparing the trees in the background and the faces at the front of the photograph, the repetition is obvious, with the same faces appearing twice in the crowd, though with slightly different expressions.</p>
