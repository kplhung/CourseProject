        <p>Pankaj Mishra (''Yearning to Be Great, India Loses Its Way,'' Op-Ed, Sept. 16) asserts that in India secular democracy is being replaced by ''a unitary Hindu nationalism,'' and this explains the government's position on Kashmir.

        <p>As a frequent visitor to India since 1966, I see no rise in Indian nationalism, or any fundamental weakening of Indian democracy. The current coalition government intervenes in the affairs of opposition-ruled states much less than previous governments, and formerly excluded groups have risen to power in the states and at the center.</p>

        <p>The government should indeed address more forcefully the attacks by extremists on Christians and churches, but these outrages can be as little ascribed to Hinduism as the occasional attack on a synagogue in the United States can be ascribed to Christianity.</p>
