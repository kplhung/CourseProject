        <p>Bodies, Bulgers and bagmen are not likely to be issues when the first presidential debate of the season is held here on Oct. 3, but they may lurk in the background.</p>
        <p>Within sight of the seaside campus of the University of Massachusetts at Boston, where the debate is to be held, the police have been digging for bodies lately -- and turning them up.</p>
        <p>Last week, on a beach in the Dorchester area, they found remains believed to be those of a murder victim connected to the city's most notorious mobster, James (Whitey) Bulger, a fugitive who has been ''Most Wanted'' and most elusive for years. And today, digging under a nearby railway bridge, the police uncovered remains that appear to be those of an adult male. The police said they would dig for another body believed to be there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bulger and a longtime associate, Stephen Flemmi, are said to be leaders of Irish-dominated organized crime and helped defeat the local Italian-led Mafia here years ago. Mr Flemmi, who is awaiting trial, claims many of their crimes were approved by the F.B.I. for their help as informers. As former Bulger associates agree to talk, more bodies turn up.</p>
        <p>In what one police officer called a ''morbid bit of irony,'' Mr. Bulger's brother, William M. Bulger, is the president of the University of Massachusetts. He has never been implicated in any of his brother's crimes. He was the president of the State Senate for 18 years, and took over the  state university system in 1996.  So, if the police do not stop digging, William M. Bulger can expect to be overseeing the debate  as the search goes on for bodies his brother is suspected of burying nearby. As he is likely to tell his guests: Welcome to Boston.</p>
