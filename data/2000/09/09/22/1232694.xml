        <p>THE Anna Sui show in Bryant Park on Wednesday evening was a dissonant experience for at least one heterosexual male. Led by Gisele, the supermodels sashayed down the runway in tight dresses, low-cut tops, bikinis, slit skirts, fishnet stockings, spiked patent-leather boots, towering stiletto heels -- your basic wardrobe for making men drool.</p>
        <p>But the skeletal figures did not induce lust. Some had cleavage, perhaps even created by God, but it looked out of place on those impossibly thin bodies. As they swiveled their hips and tottered on the high heels, the image that came to mind was not Marilyn Monroe but baby giraffe.</p>
        <p>Why must models starve themselves? There is a standard answer in the fashion world: clothes look better on a clothes-hanger figure. But maybe designers' egos are involved, too. Maybe they don't want womanly curves distracting from their genius.</p>
        <p>They could be using a fashion version of Richard Strauss's approach to his music. In 1909, during rehearsals for his opera ''Elektra,'' Strauss shouted at the orchestra's conductor: ''Louder, louder! I can still hear the singers.'' Call it the the But-Enough-About-You Ploy, or simply the Strauss Strategem: Thinner, thinner! I can still see the hips.</p>
        <p>But then why would women put up with this look? Why were they packed into the tent at Bryant Park gazing reverently at bodies that looked nothing like their own? Linda Wells explained from her seat in the first row.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to see myself going up and down the runway,'' said Ms. Wells, the editor in chief of Allure. ''I've had two kids. I don't even like to look at myself in the mirror. I want to dream.'' She looked fine to me, but of course that was beside the point.</p>
        <p>Fashion shows are for women to look at women, and women like to look thin, at least in modern America. (Plump has long been fashionable in societies with food scarcity.) When psychologists ask American women to pick their ideal female figure, they'll choose a body that's thinner than average.</p>
        <p>If asked to guess what men consider the ideal female body, women will again pick a thin figure. But they're wrong, as psychologists have also found. American men prefer a female body that's average, not thin. And they prefer an hourglass figure, as do men around the world. Men's taste for plumpness or thinness varies, but they consistently like to see a body that is proportioned so the waist is one third smaller than the hips.. The emaciated look just doesn't work for the average guy. In an English study, men rating pictures of women's bodies gave the highest marks to women in the normal weight range, but the zaftig look was also popular. A woman of normal weight could gain 15 pounds without losing much appeal. But losing 15 pounds would make a big difference, because the men gave low ratings to fashion-model bodies.</p>
        <p>EVOLUTIONARY psychologists have no trouble explaining why these tastes have been around since the days of hunter-gatherers: hourglass figures and normal levels of body fat correlate with increased fertility. Today, though, we confront the strange new spectacle of rich and famous men apparently lusting after waifs. What has turned them into model-chasers? Have they shed their hunter-gatherer libidos? Are they rewriting the laws of evolution? Are their genes doomed? Or have they spent too much time at fashion shows?</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there is a simple explanation for this phenomenon, arrived at independently by two experts. In ''The Evolution of Desire,'' the psychologist David M. Buss writes, ''Men seek attractive women as mates not simply for their reproductive value, but also as signals of status to same-sex competitors and to other potential mates.'' So a woman who is widely considered attractive, if only by women and the fashion press, becomes a valuable prize.</p>
        <p>This quest for status makes sense not only to evolutionary psychologists, who see status as a key to male reproductive success, but also to researchers doing field work in the fashion world. Their technical term for ''signals of status'' is, of course, ''arm candy.''</p>
        <p>''There's a certain kind of guy who just wants to be seen with the model of the moment,'' said Michael Gross, the author of ''Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women.''</p>
        <p>''In many cases, they don't even sleep with the girl,'' he said. ''What matters to them more than anything else is what other guys think of them. They think: I have the Rolex, I have the Ferrari, I have the supermodel. When I walk in the room, other guys notice.'' He lusts in his heart, but not exactly for her.</p>
