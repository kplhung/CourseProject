        <p>Bar Demi's clever name suggests smallness as well as its funny address. But demi isn't the half of it. Fold that half in half, and you get a better idea of the dimensions of this seven-table wine bar, formerly the takeout shop of Verbena, now an appealing niche with a small menu and a big wine list that specializes in half bottles.</p>
        <p>The dishes are appetizer size and can be ordered a la carte or organized into tasting trios, or tiers, matched to wines. The Alsatian tier, arranged on three stacked plates inside a steel armature, consists of a sweet corn flan with lobster, fava beans and basil; duck rillette with goat cheese on toast; and smoked cod chowder with buckwheat biscuits. The menu suggests two wines by the glass, a pinot blanc from Trimbach ($7.50 a glass) or a Pikes riesling from Australia ($9). It also proposes, in half bottles, an Oregon pinot gris from King Estate ($14) and three Alsatians: a riesling from Paul Blanck ($15), a gewurztraminer from Zind-Humbrecht's Clos Windsbuhl ($40) and a pinot gris from Zind-Humbrecht's Clos Saint Urbain ($60).</p>

        <p>The dishes are appetizer size and can be ordered a la carte or organized into tasting trios, or tiers, matched to wines. The Alsatian tier, arranged on three stacked plates inside a steel armature, consists of a sweet corn flan with lobster, fava beans and basil; duck rillette with goat cheese on toast; and smoked cod chowder with buckwheat biscuits. The menu suggests two wines by the glass, a pinot blanc from Trimbach ($7.50 a glass) or a Pikes riesling from Australia ($9).

        <p>There's a tier for rose wines and one for pinot noirs, as well as a dessert tier paired with sweet wines, and a warm-weather cheese tier paired with sauvignon blancs from the Loire and Napa Valley. The fall will bring a change in the cheese roster and in the accompanying wines. The list of 80 wines by the bottle and 50 by the half bottle allows for creative maneuvering, and the snacks can be much more than an excuse to quaff. Grilled sardines on toast, resting on a thick bed of wilted spinach splashed with a little vinegar, make an ideal partner for a good rose, and a skewer of grilled lamb chunks and firm slabs of portobello mushroom cries out for a broad-gauged red with lots of spice if possible. The menu suggests a glass of Oregon pinot noir or a half bottle of Chambolle-Musigny from Antonin Guyon. I might reach deep for a zinfandel, an amarone or a big bad Rhone.</p>
        <p>Bar Demi, 125 1/2 East 17th Street, Manhattan; (212) 260-0900. Tasting tiers, $10 to $18.</p>
