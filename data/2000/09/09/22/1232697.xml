        <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration found itself in the odd position yesterday of having to emphasize that it would not cooperate in a proposed, prime-time reality television program in which contestants would vie for a televised trip to the International Space Station.</p>
        <p>The agency was responding to a New York Times report a multimedia company with ties to the space agency, Dreamtime Holdings Inc., proposed the space show to Fox, CBS and ABC during meetings in which it reportedly said the agency had signed off on the concept.</p>
        <p>NASA said that it never did so and that it could not envision participating in such a program in the near future. It would not rule out doing so, however, in the more distant future. NBC is producing a program in which a civilian will be sent to space aboard a Russian rocket.</p>
        <p>''It's something we're not prepared to look at right now,'' said Peggy C. Wilhide, a NASA spokeswoman. ''Maybe two years, three years, who knows?''</p>
        <p>So just how did it happen that executives with three major networks came to understand that the agency was ready to work with them to produce just such a program?</p>
        <p>Direct answers were somewhat hard to come by yesterday. Network executives said they had been told that NASA was on board. A spokeswoman for Dreamtime, which promoted the project with the Endeavor talent agency, said it would have no comment ''until there is a signed deal.'' She would not elaborate.</p>
        <p>For its part, NASA said it was not sure what was said during the meetings between Dreamtime and network executives.</p>
        <p>But the space agency said the situation might have been the natural outcome of a deal with Dreamtime that it signed last spring in an effort to reduce costs and better capitalize on its extraordinary content -- space -- in the new media age.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, Dreamtime said it would digitize NASA's huge collection of space footage, make it available to the public over the Internet and help produce television documentaries and educational programs about the International Space Station, for a profit.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Ms. Wilhide said, Dreamtime was mandated to go out and ''push the edge of the envelope and come up with out-of-the-box, innovative ways'' to do that.</p>
        <p>The pitch to the network executives would have been right along those lines, she said. But, she said, when exploring options, Dreamtime is not supposed to lead potential partners to believe that it is speaking directly for NASA.</p>
        <p>Rather, it is supposed to clear ideas with the agency before moving to close any deals on its behalf.</p>
        <p>''Will we do everything they suggest?'' she said. ''Probably not. Will we do a lot of what they suggest? Yes.''</p>
