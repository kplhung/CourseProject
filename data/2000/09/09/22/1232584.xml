        <p>SHE strung together 25 strikeouts and 12 2/3 innings of raw dominance, but it wasn't until after one fatal mistake, her nightmarish defeat, that Lisa Fernandez staged her most impressive show of uncommon strength.</p>
        <p>She didn't try to hide, as if the world weren't watching, or didn't exist. She didn't pose, or pretend, that she wasn't in pain. She walked into the news conference and talked about the home run pitch one out from victory, that confounding drop ball ''that didn't drop'' and wound up far over the left-field fence. And after a few more questions, when the press aides tried to shoo her away, her body language said, relax fellas, I can deal with this, and did.</p>
        <p>''It's almost like this is not real,'' Fernandez said. ''To be able to put on a show at the Olympics and then it's gone, now it's like I'm waiting for someone to pinch me, to wake me up.''</p>
        <p>She stood there, eyes moist under her visor, giving credit to the Australians, accepting blame for the Americans, guaranteeing that she wouldn't give up. The last time a home run just like this one happened, an Australian lightning bolt in the 10th inning of the Atlanta Olympics, Fernandez got over it, and her United States softball team recovered to win the gold medal in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>This is Australia, four years later, with the competition gap narrowed and too many American hitters mired in a deep and inglorious slump.</p>
        <p>Though yesterday's 2-1, 13-inning Australia victory that saw a parade of 42 women go down on strikes was extreme, hitters in this pitching-dominated sport often seem to be waving at air, at 60-plus miles an hour from 40 feet away.</p>
        <p>Too close, some journalists, typically male, have been heard to snort, at the softball site in this Sydney suburb. Too much of an unnatural advantage, a misleading sense of power, as if the dunk shot in basketball is some astounding feat for a well-conditioned athlete who stands 6 feet 6 inches. As if technology hasn't contributed to the 140 mile-an-hour men's tennis serve and those soaring drives off the golf tee. As if the idea of a woman like Lisa Fernandez doing with a softball what the macho mound men like Roger Clemens do with a baseball is a bit too much to take.</p>
        <p>''The image of women and how they are portrayed is changing,'' Fernandez had said earlier, before Petra Edebone's blast sent the Americans to their third straight defeat, leaving them no margin of error to make the medal round. ''A lot of people are looking at women athletes now, looking and photographing us as muscular and strong. But how the poses are done -- that's a different question.''</p>
        <p>How the American swimmer Jenny Thompson appeared in Sports Illustrated -- bare from the waist up with her hands covering her breasts -- created something of an uproar in the pre-Olympics rush. Critics hit Thompson and the magazine for engaging in soft porn. Defenders suggested that the critics chill, that Thompson was hiding what was nobody's business while celebrating her muscles in less intimate places.</p>
        <p>Which sounded somewhat sincere, until the magazine followed up with the Swedish swimmer Therese Alshammar scantily clad, in several seductive positions that made the Anna Kournikova spread of several months ago look like a Heidi retrospective.</p>
        <p>The question, as raised by Fernandez, was this: if these kinds of photos are only about portraying female athletes as strong and fit, why do the models always seem to be imported from some frat boy fantasy? When did Barbie become the prototypical tough gal?</p>
        <p>''It's one thing when you have a sprinter bending down, in the starting position, which is the natural athletic pose,'' Fernandez said. ''But when they are put in a unnatural position, when there clearly is a sexual connotation, that's going too far, in my opinion. That's not called for, in order to get the athletic message across.</p>
        <p>''That's why I love what our game represents, what it offers to all girls, whether they are fast or slow, tall or short, stocky or thin. This sport integrates all athletes, and measures strength in different ways. And because all of our games are televised after none were in Atlanta, I've been saying that this would be a very big Olympics for us.''</p>
        <p>And that is another reason why this daughter of a Cuban immigrant was taking the re-enactment of the '96 walk-off home run against Australia so hard.</p>
        <p>''I have no excuses and there are no excuses,'' said Fernandez, who broke down and cried over her unexpected futility at the plate earlier this week.</p>
        <p>She had been a tower of power from the No. 3 slot in the batting order and a virtual monolith on the mound. A pitcher so dominating that she could recall the last hit Petra Edebone reached her for, a couple of years ago, ''a blooper into center.''</p>
        <p>She is only 29 and hoping to play in two more Olympics. She lost 20 pounds preparing for Sydney, for quickness and endurance, to be more athletic and fit. The only pose people will remember from yesterday is her walking off the mound, in numbing disbelief. The Aussies did it to her again, but Lisa Fernandez, through the tears, was facing up to her mistake, staying strong.</p>
