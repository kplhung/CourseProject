        <p>Jenny Thompson was last out of the pool after tonight's 100-meter freestyle. This was her final individual event in her third Olympic Games. Soon she will retire at 27 and enter medical school at Columbia University. She checked the giant television screen and the scoreboard to see her name in third place, tied with her teammate Dara Torres in 54.43 seconds, behind another gold-medal effort by Inge de Bruijn. Thompson swam slowly toward the edge of the pool, as if she did not want to leave.</p>
        <p>It was a somber moment, filled with condolence instead of elation. Her career was ending, unsurpassed but oddly unrequited.</p>
        <p>No female American athlete has ever won seven gold medals in the Olympics, as Thompson has. But all of her victories have come in relays, including two here. None of the golds has come in individual races, the mark of swimming greatness. The United States won eight medals tonight, including a victory in the 200-meter backstroke in 1 minute 56.76 seconds by Lenny Krayzelburg, who took the 100 backstroke Tuesday. All the same, tonight was an evening tinged with consolation.</p>
        <p>It was evident on Thompson's stoic face as she lost again to de Bruijn of the Netherlands. It was evident in the sober way she stood on the medal podium next to Torres, with whom she has had a tense relationship. At 33, Torres is the only American swimmer ever to compete in four Olympics. Returning to the sport after a seven-year layoff, she was ecstatic about her bronze medal, matching the one she won in the 100 butterfly, but Thompson clearly was not.</p>
        <p>''I think they were in two different places on the medal stand,'' said Richard Quick, the coach of the American women's team and the personal coach of both Thompson and Torres. ''Dara was celebrating the fact that she won her second individual medal. Jenny had just swum her last individual race. There was a goal she set that she didn't accomplish. Maybe she was a little subdued as a result of that.''</p>
        <p>At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Thompson did not qualify for any individual events. Tonight, just as she had done at the 1992 Barcelona Games, she failed to swim her best race in the most important moment of her career. The winner, de Bruijn, did not match her own world record of 53.77 seconds, set a day earlier, but she won by half a second in 53.83 over Therese Alshammar of Sweden.</p>
        <p>Once a talented but indifferent swimmer who was kicked off the Dutch team for her listless training, de Bruijn has now won the 100 butterfly and the 100 freestyle at the Sydney Games, and will be favored in Saturday's 50 freestyle. She holds the world record in all three events. She has been able to do what Thompson has not -- deliver her most assertive performances in the most crucial races.</p>
        <p>''At a critical time, she came through with a critical performance,'' Quick said of de Bruijn. ''I take my hat off to her.'' He added: ''There is a state of mind that great athletes can get into that the rest of us don't understand. They relish the pressure of the critical moment.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps that is where Thompson came up short. Even with two world championships and two world records, she did not thrive in the pressure of the critical moment. In the relays, sure. In individual events, though, she never fulfilled what she had intended.</p>
        <p>Even if she had swum her personal best of 54.07, however, Thompson would have finished far behind de Bruijn tonight. The dominance of the Dutch woman's performances has inevitably raised questions about their legitimacy. Susie O'Neill, the Australian Olympic champion, called de Bruijn's flurry of records ''pretty suss,'' or suspect, earlier this year, then apologized.</p>
        <p>Drug testing in Olympic sports is so deficient that there is no certain way to tell whether athletes are using illicit substances to enhance their performances. No tests exist, for instance, for such drugs as human growth hormone and artificial blood. Every remarkable performance in sports such as swimming and track and field brings immediate suspicion.</p>
        <p>Women's swimming has become the most tarnished of the Olympic sports amid revelations about systematic East German cheating in the 70's and 80's, Chinese drug use in the 90's, positive tests by Americans, and the 1998 banning of the Irish swimmer Michelle Smith de Bruin from international competition for four years. De Bruijn, who won three gold medals at the Atlanta Games, was found to have spiked a urine test with alcohol in 1998.</p>
        <p>The sad thing, said Ad Roskam, team manager for the Dutch swimmers, is that innocent athletes cannot prove their innocence.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't matter what you do -- you can have your whole body tested -- but everyone is talking about drugs,'' said Jacco Verhaeren, de Bruijn's boyfriend and one of her coaches, who said the state of the sport made him furious.</p>
        <p>De Bruijn, who is 27, has vehemently denied using performance-enhancing drugs. Her supporters point out that she has been an Olympic-level competitor since 1992. After she did not compete in the Atlanta Games because she lacked motivation for training, she moved to Portland, Ore., in 1998 to work with Paul Bergen, a respected coach who worked previously with the Olympic champion Tracy Caulkins.</p>
        <p>Hard work, not banned substances, has made her into a champion swimmer, de Bruijn said. In the pool, she said she trained with a weight belt, and even wore shoes, to increase resistance in the water. Her dry-land training includes power-lifting, running and rope climbing.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't really bother me anymore,'' de Bruijn said of the skepticism about her performances. ''I know I have worked hard. It comes down to jealousy if people still think that.''</p>
        <p>Quick said on Wednesday that he presumed that de Bruijn did not use performance-enhancing drugs. The subject of drugs is a gnawing one for Thompson, who with Quick accused the Chinese of cheating after Zhuang Yong defeated her in the 100-meter freestyle at the 1992 Barcelona Games. At least three dozen Chinese swimmers have since tested positive for drugs.</p>
        <p>''I do think it's a sad state of events when everyone who does really well gets questioned,'' Thompson said tonight. ''At the same time, it's sad there is a reason to question. I think there is cheating in this sport. I'm not going to say I think Inge is cheating. But I do think it's good to question things like that.''</p>
        <p>Without naming names, Quick on Wednesday night deplored the quality and frequency of drug testing and said he did not believe this Olympic swimming competition had been drug free. He lamented that the sport had a ''cloud over it.'' Tonight the Dutch took issue with his remarks and responded with bitter recrimination.</p>
        <p>Quick is ''the most stupid idiot I ever saw,'' said Dr. Cees-Rein van den Hoogenband, the father of the two-time Olympic champion Pieter van den Hoogenband and an expert in trauma and sports medicine. He said the Americans were bringing up the issue of drugs out of jealousy because ''they can't win.''</p>
        <p>Quick responded that he was not pointing fingers at van den Hoogenband and said of the swimmer's father, ''He's entitled to his opinion.''</p>
        <p>Of his own swimmers, Quick said he was proud but slightly disappointed. He believed that the 100 freestyle had been winnable for the Americans. Torres said that sharing the medal stand with Thompson seemed ironic, considering that Quick had separated their training sessions at Stanford University last December because every workout ''seemed like an Olympic final.''</p>
        <p>One race remains for Thompson, Saturday's 400-meter individual medley relay, in which she may add an eighth gold to her total, along with the individual silver and bronze in her overall tally. Even in her disappointment tonight, she seemed to come to terms with her career, saying she was happy because she had given her best effort.</p>
        <p>''It's time for me to stop looking at what I don't have and start looking at what I do have,'' Thompson said. ''I have more medals than any American woman in any sport. I'm really proud of what I've done. I have something to hang my hat on.''</p>
