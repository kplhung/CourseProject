        <p>India's Broad Range</p>
        <p>Many Indian restaurants in New York offer a standard repertory of a dozen or so similar dishes, but others, like the 12 below, offer a glimpse of the true range of this complex and varied cuisine. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)</p>
        <p>1. Bay Leaf</p>
        <p>* [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 957-1818</p>
        <p>49 West 56th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The buffet lunch at calm and modern Bay Leaf is one of the best deals in Midtown, and the food makes it doubly worthy. Dokla, the fermented lentil cake, is scattered with black mustard seeds, coconut shreds and cilantro leaves. Potatoes in a thin, bright orange broth with curry leaf are so hot they tickle. Spinach and baby eggplant mingle in a dish of rich oiliness, and dal, yellow lentils, has enough freshly ground spices to make the head reel. As good as lunch is, dinner is uneven.</p>
        <p>2. Chola</p>
        <p>** [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 688-4619</p>
        <p>232 East 58th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Chola does not look very different from dozens of modest Indian restaurants in New York City. Until you pick up the menu, which is large and fascinating, with many vegetarian specialties from southern India, some intriguing British-Indian offerings, even a small group of dishes from the Jews of Calcutta. The appetizers are especially appealing, like Mysore masala dosai, a crisp crepe so large the ends hang off the plate. Folded inside is a delightful mixture of spicy potatoes and hot chutney. Hyderabadi korma, a mixture of vegetables cooked in coconut milk with curry leaves and mustard seeds, is delicious, and phall, lamb or chicken cooked with abundant fresh green chilies, is exciting and very hot.</p>
        <p>3. Delhi Palace</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(718) 507-0666</p>
        <p>37-33 74th Street</p>
        <p>Jackson Heights, Queens</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Delhi Palace is a northern Indian restaurant that takes its food seriously. The best dishes are the rich, complex curries, each tailored to the main ingredients. Shrimp vindaloo comes in a remarkable dark brown curry that tastes of vinegar and chocolate, not a flat flavor but one that builds in the mouth, layer by layer, culminating in the chocolate sensation. Kadai gosht is another exceptional curry, with tender pieces of lamb in a tomato-and-onion sauce flavored with ginger and chilies.</p>
        <p>4. Diwan's Curry House</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 721-3400</p>
        <p>302 Columbus Avenue, near 74th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This Indian restaurant is unusual for two reasons: pork spareribs and a dining room decorated in a zebra-skin motif are things you almost never see in Indian restaurants. The menu's more conventional items can be excellent, like katori chat and bhel poori. Appetizers include cashew nut rolls; and crab chili fry (crab meat, spices, coconut and mustard with a hint of tamarind). Entrees include tandoori prawns; paneer kesari (saffron-flavored homemade cheese and an almond sauce); and malai kofta (potato and cheese dumplings stuffed with apricots in a cashew nut sauce).</p>
        <p>5. Mavalli Palace</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 679-5535</p>
        <p>46 East 29th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Mavalli Palace (pronounced MAH-vuh-lee) excels at the lively, spicy vegetarian dishes of southern India, food that even the most dedicated of carnivores can enjoy. Appetizers like rasa vada, savory lentil doughnuts in a spicy broth, and crisp, distinctive samosas are rich and multidimensional. Some offerings, like alu chat, intensely peppery chunks of potato and onion, and mooli paratha, an airy layered bread stuffed with spiced radish, are so hot they make the eyes tear and are deeply flavored as well. Main courses are likewise powerfully flavored, like masala dosai, a huge crepe stuffed with potato and onion that is as gorgeous as it is delicious.</p>
        <p>6. Mughlai</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 724-6363</p>
        <p>320 Columbus Avenue, at 75th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The menu at Mughlai offers many familiar Indian dishes, yet it also invites diners to try regional dishes that you almost never see at other restaurants. Appetizers include shrimp flavored with garlic, curry leaves and mustard seeds in a zesty sauce; an assortment of shish kebab; chicken or fish tikka; and keema samosas, ground lamb cooked with a blend of spices wrapped in a light crispy crust. Entrees include saag gosht, a blend of lamb smothered in creamed spinach; shrimp jalfrezi, shrimp stir-fried with fresh vegetables in a sweet-and-sour sauce; and murg makhanwalla, boneless tandoori chicken poached in a rich tomato sauce flavored with fenugreek leaves.</p>
        <p>7. Pongal</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 696-9458</p>
        <p>110 Lexington Avenue, near 27th Street</p>
        <p>$ All major cards, except American Express</p>
        <p>Pongal specializes in southern Indian food, centering on dosai, crepes made of fermented batters that are stuffed and rolled into cylinders or cones that can stretch two and a half feet. They may look daunting, but they are light and delicious, filled with spiced mixtures of potatoes and onions. Other dishes include iddly, steamed cakes of lentils and rice that are served in spiced broths, and uttappam, a thick pancake made of iddly batter and served with onions and peppers. For dessert, Pongal serves shrikhand, a wonderful yogurt custard flavored with nutmeg, cardamom and saffron.</p>
        <p>8. Salaam Bombay</p>
        <p>** [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 226-9400</p>
        <p>317 Greenwich Street, at Duane Street</p>
        <p>TriBeCa</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Salaam Bombay looks like any other upscale Indian restaurant in New York, but its menu goes well beyond the usual dishes. While the variety of chicken, lamb and seafood is unusual, the vegetable selections are where Salaam Bombay really shines. Crisp little pooris, filled with potatoes, yogurt and tamarind sauce, and khaman dhokla, steamed lentil-and-yogurt cakes, are particularly good appetizers. The best main courses are Gujarati, like ringna bataka nu shaak, a spicy, rich eggplant and potato dish; and undhiyu, an intriguing mixture of sweet potato, beans, eggplant, spicy lentil dumplings and fresh lentils still in the pod. Salaam's custardy shrikhand is dreamy and delicious.</p>
        <p>9. Sapphire Indian Cuisine</p>
        <p>++</p>
        <p>(212) 245-4444</p>
        <p>1845 Broadway, at 61st Street</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Sapphire may not be the last word in Indian cuisine, but it is good enough and good-looking enough to advance the cause. Chicken specialties include chicken sorpotel, cooked with roasted coconut and exotic spices; chicken saag, cooked with fresh spinach and spices; and chicken hara masala, cooked with fresh coriander, mint, green chilies and spices. Lamb specials include lamb rogan josh, cubes of meat stewed in aromatic spices and herbs, and lamb vindaloo, cubes marinated and cooked in a hot sauce.</p>
        <p>10. Shaan</p>
        <p>** [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 977-8400</p>
        <p>57 West 48th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Most of the food at Shaan is delicious, but the big menu can be a minefield. Sometimes different dishes turn out to taste more or less the same, but order right, and the food can be a complete delight. Dahi batata poori, tiny puffs of the great Indian bread stuffed with a searingly spicy mixture of minced potatoes, chickpeas and bean sprouts, are a great beginning, as is tawa chicken, moist, boneless pieces of white meat cooked with onions, peppers and lots of spices. Tandoori quail makes inspired use of the clay oven, and lobster, rolled into a smooth, spicy red sauce rich with chilies and ginger, is fabulous. Vegetable dishes like methi palak corn, baby corn in a sumptuous spinach sauce shot through with the strong taste of fenugreek, are a joy.</p>
        <p>11. Surya</p>
        <p>** [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 807-7770.</p>
        <p>302 Bleecker Street, near Seventh Avenue South</p>
        <p>West Village</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The restaurant, named for the sun (in Tamil), has a small garden in the back along with a sleek interior. Its menu features mostly southern Indian dishes, often filtered through the technique of France. The main courses have a bold freshness. Rack of lamb is particularly impressive. But what is most splendid about Surya is the entirely meatless side of the menu. It is, in fact, difficult to come up with a more exciting place to eat vegetables in New York City. Try the okra, sauteed in a thick mixture of tomatoes, onion garlic and kokum. The desserts are out of the ordinary, too.</p>
        <p>12. Tiffin</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 791-3510</p>
        <p>18 Murray Street, near Church Street</p>
        <p>Lower Manhattan</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>At its best, the vegetarian Indian food at this trim little restaurant is fascinating and delicious. It's never less than interesting and should be a must-try for anybody curious about the range and breadth of Indian flavors. Appetizers include exceptional samosas; and smoked tomato rasam, a wonderfully bright broth that emphasizes the fruitiness of tomatoes, enhanced by tamarind, cumin and mustard seeds, with a hot chili counterpoint that brings it all together. Among the best main courses are a Gujarati melange of potatoes and vegetables with adzuki beans and plantains, strongly flavored with mustard and aniseed; and Jaipuri khazana, an unusual blend of potatoes, cauliflower, red peppers, carrots and fruit served in a curry sauce.</p>
