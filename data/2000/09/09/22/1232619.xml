        <p>British Airways and KLM abandoned their merger talks today after months of discussions failed to produce a workable blueprint for what would have been one of the most ambitious airline combinations.</p>
        <p>Numerous regulatory and operational hurdles, in the end, were too much for the bargaining powers of the two companies to overcome.  ''We always recognized that this would be a complex transaction, involving not only commercial and economic issues, but also aeropolitical, regulatory and other matters.

        <p>British Airways and KLM abandoned their merger talks today after months of discussions failed to produce a workable blueprint for what would have been one of the most ambitious airline combinations.</p>
        <p>Numerous regulatory and operational hurdles, in the end, were too much for the bargaining powers of the two companies to overcome.  ''We always recognized that this would be a complex transaction, involving not only commercial and economic issues, but also aeropolitical, regulatory and other matters. Although we made considerable progress, it has not been possible to resolve these,'' said Rod Eddington, chief executive of British Airways, and Leo van Wijk, chief executive of KLM, in a joint statement.</p>
        <p>The talks and their collapse leave a trail of uncertainty about the future of consolidation in the airline industry in Europe and the United States.</p>
        <p>''The regulatory hurdles in place are hard to overcome,'' said Martin Borghetto, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. ''The process wouldn't have been solved within weeks or months.''</p>
        <p>British Airways had been betting on substantial savings from a KLM merger to help it return to profitability after registering losses last year for the first time last year since its privatization 13 years ago. But to achieve such a goal, British Airways executives had insisted on control over the merged airline, people close to the negotiations said.</p>
        <p>Obtaining that control would have threatened the antitrust immunity KLM receives as part of the so-called open skies agreements negotiated between the Dutch and American governments, an executive close to KLM said. That immunity, contingent upon a certain percentage of KLM remaining in the hands of Dutch nationals, allows KLM to share sales, pricing and operational details with its United States partner, Northwest Airlines.</p>
        <p>British Airways is not currently protected by similar immunity, and is more restricted in the information it can share with its partner in the United States, American Airlines. The British and American governments have been working toward such an accord, and the latest talks are scheduled for Oct. 18-19.</p>
        <p>Roger Maynard, director of investments at British Airways, said the company had devised a structure that it believed would have allowed KLM to retain its antitrust immunity status. It had called for KLM to place existing route rights in a Dutch holding company that would operate as a subsidiary of the merged British Airways-KLM airline.</p>
        <p>KLM, however, balked at becoming a subsidiary.</p>
        <p>Without a structure for the combined company, British Airways and KLM were unable to agree on price, people close to the negotiations said.</p>
        <p>Other issues that still needed resolution included disposals of certain hubs necessary to meet antitrust approval. It is also unclear which U.S. alliance would have remained intact.</p>
        <p>Moreover, British Airways and KLM would have faced the problems of integration that confront many mergers. Some analysts said the companies remained as incompatible for merging now as they were in 1992, the last time they discussed merging.</p>
        <p>Since then, British Airways has been repositioning itself as a premium carrier by focusing on first-class and business-class passengers. KLM, has been battling with other European carriers for lower-fare passengers.</p>
        <p>Some analysts said that the collapse of the negotiations diminished the likelihood of such mergers in the future.</p>
        <p>''When you merge, you have to take a lot of costs out of the business to make it worthwhile,'' said Chris Tarry, an analyst with Commerzbank. ''And that always entails more risk.''</p>
