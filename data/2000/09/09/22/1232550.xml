        <p>A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>''AMAZONS OF THE AVANT-GARDE,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several of them continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If only a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibition isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems if anything more, not less, remarkable, for having as little to do with sex as it does, and almost everything to do with painting. The works, many of them anyway, have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8, students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).</p>

        <p>''AMERICAN MODERN, 1925-1940: DESIGN FOR A NEW AGE'' (through Jan. 7) and ''A CENTURY OF DESIGN, PART 2: 1925-1950'' (through Oct. 29), Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. ''American Modern,'' the larger and more interesting of these shows, deals with the period between two design extravaganzas,  the Exposition des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris in 1925 and the New York World's Fair of 1939-40. Drawn from the Met's own collection and that of a patron, John C. Waddell, the show presents furniture, appliances, clocks, radios, cameras, textiles, tableware, posters and parts of a snappy blue-and-chrome dining room, along with other work by Bel Geddes, Deskey, Dreyfuss, Frankl, Loewy, Noguchi, Teague and Wright. The range is from French Art Deco, whose hallmark was luxury and chic, through Bauhaus geometric austerity, to the machine-influenced, streamlined mode developed by American industrial designers. ''A Century of Design,'' Part 2 of a four-part survey focusing on European 20th-century styles, also draws from the Met's collection. Although studded with star names like Aalto, Breuer, Eames, Ruhlmann and Mies van der Rohe, the show is lackluster by contrast. There is no scarcity of famous chairs, and other good things include a wonderful scale drawing for the Daimler-Benz sport convertible No. 3384 (circa 1933). But there are more than a few nontreasures, like Miro's 1942 earthenware vase, whose raison d'etre is hard to determine. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and the elderly (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>''ART AT WORK: 40 YEARS OF THE CHASE MANHATTAN COLLECTION,'' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-5555 (through Oct. 1). On the 40th anniversary of the Chase Manhattan Collection, which since 1960 has displayed more than 17,000 works of art in places where Chase does business, a sampling from its multinational, intercontinental holdings is on view here. Filling every corner of the museum, the work includes pieces by contemporary stars like Chuck Close, Scott Burton, Nam June Paik, Richard Prince and Christian Boltanski. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (John Russell).</p>
        <p>''ARTIST IN THE MARKETPLACE: 20th ANNUAL EXHIBITION,'' Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, (718) 681-6000 (through Oct. 15). Organized by Lydia Yee and Edwin Ramoran, this is the 20th edition of an annual residency program show for 36 participants. Three dozen artists are about two dozen too many for the allotted basement space, and with room for only one or two entries a person, almost everyone gets the benefit of the doubt, critically speaking. Some work always manages to make an impression, and the most promising this year takes the form of a light-touch brand of text-based conceptualism. Hours: Wednesdays, 3 to 9 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $3; $2, students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>''CURIOS AND TREASURES,'' Costume Institute, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through Jan. 21). Well-selected, expertly installed and beautifully lighted, this exhibition is permeated with the sense of several sets of eyes doing the right thing. Its 65 garments and accessories, some fancy, some very plain, are all from the institute's collection. They travel through four or five centuries of European culture, touching down lightly here and there. Highlights include a suite of dresses and capes by Mariano Fortuny, a pielike leather hat from early 17th-century Austria, a formidable farmer's smock from 19th-century England and three rare 17th-century men's doublets. While this assortment may sound a bit piecemeal, the overall effect is close to magical, conveying a vivid sense of how invention, evolution and historical borrowing combine in the life of any art form. The installation makes the act of looking a nearly undiluted pleasure. Hours and admission: See above (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''THE EMBODIED IMAGE: CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY FROM THE JOHN B. ELLIOTT COLLECTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 7). In China, the written word has traditionally been the highest art form of all, and a source of political and emotional power. To see that power in action, check out this grandly scaled exhibition, which brings together two superb calligraphy collections -- from Princeton University and the Met -- in the most comprehensive survey of such material yet seen in these parts. The dozens of scrolls covered with hand-written words collectively radiate a kind of conversational buzz and suggest a richly varied cast of personalities: fastidious court functionaries, impulsive social agitators, unworldly monks, visionary poets. Together, they offer an ice-breaking introduction to an art that can all too easily seem, to non-Chinese speakers, unapproachable. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''THE FIGURE: ANOTHER SIDE OF MODERNISM,'' Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, (718) 448-2500 (through Jan. 15). This vast, uneven but enthralling grab bag of a show invites us to count the ways that artists have painted the human figure during the last 50 years. The curator, Lily Wei, selected 125 paintings by as many artists, including most of the usual suspects, from Willem de Kooning to Lisa Yuskavage. Among the best works are a huge grisaille painting of a towering giantess by Alfred Leslie; a radiant portrait of his wife by Alex Katz; Catherine Murphy's intensely realistic picture of big feet; and Elliot Green's fusion of a Mondrianesque grid and a rubbery cartoon couple. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $2 (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>BARBARA KRUGER, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Oct. 22). A lot has changed about the art world in the 20 years or so since Barbara Kruger came on the scene with her snappy photomontages, but a lot has not changed about her work. Her trademark red, white and black text-and-photograph montage is a brand product of the immediate past. Dense and noisy, this retrospective, including audio embellishments, has an intended carnival atmosphere without frivolity. Your reaction will necessarily depend on a blend of generational sympathy, political concord, aesthetic expectation and tolerance for sarcasm. Ms. Kruger was one of the 80's artists adapting Conceptualism via mass-media forms for political ends, thereby helping to broaden the purview of contemporary art and make the art world more gender-balanced. Young artists reacting against her sort of political stridency now explore subtler, more aesthetically varied routes toward expressions of selfhood. Ms. Kruger, in a sense, helped to pave the way for her own diminished currency, which for a political artist like her may be viewed as a kind of success. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays andSundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''THE OPULENT EYE OF ALEXANDER GIRARD,'' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 (through March 18). The first comprehensive look at the multifaceted work of the architect and designer. Girard's contribution to contemporary design was a freedom of approach that put to use all sorts of visual stimuli, from Italian stage sets to Mexican folk art to motifs from modern technology, making exuberant use of color, pattern texture and ornament. The exhibition displays -- in photographs, models and objects -- his fabrics, graphics, interiors, furniture, tableware, radio cabinets and much else. A whole room is devoted to the more than 300 fabric and wallpaper designs he did for the Herman Miller Furniture Company from the 1950's to the early 1970's, with fresh patterns and colors that pushed the envelope of middle-class taste. While Girard may not have been a heavyweight in American design, he was one of its liveliest figures. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays, to 9 p.m.; Sundays noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $8; $3, students and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''PIERRE ET GILLES,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Jan. 7). No history of postmodern photography, fashion photography, celebrity portraiture, record album covers or the high-brow beefcake tradition would be complete without the work of the French photo team known as Pierre et Gilles, who have collaborated on over-the-top, tightly styled, hand-finished photographs since 1976 and become wildly famous in Europe in the process. In their first American museum retrospective, their work feels more than a little embalmed, existing behind a not-so-invisible shield of artistic conservatism. Certain images come to life as art objects -- most notably one of a beautiful young sailor up to his chest in water with an irridescent night sky behind him -- but they are few and far between. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students, artists and the elderly (Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''PAINTERS IN PARIS: 1895-1950,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Dec. 31). This show of more than 100 paintings celebrates the Met's acquisitions of works by School of Paris painters, going back to 1946 when Gertrude Stein bequeathed her portrait, done by Picasso in 1906. The portrait served as a cornerstone for later acquisitions in the field, particularly over the last 20 years. The museum's increasing interest and diligent wooing of collectors have brought not only single works but also groups and entire holdings, like the 18 major objects bequeathed by Florene M. Schoenborn in 1995 and the Jacques and Natasha Gelman trove of 85 masterpieces accessioned in 1998. The treasures on view include works by some of the 20th century's greatest: Bonnard, Braque, Chagall, de Chirico, Derain, Gris, Leger, Matisse, Miro, Modigliani and Picasso, in an animated arrangement that should beguile the most jaded Met-goer. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''MARTHA ROSLER: POSITIONS IN THE LIFE WORLD,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Oct. 8), and International Center of Photography, Fifth Avenue at 94th Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Oct. 1). This 30-year career retrospective is also the first major museum show for this seminal Brooklyn-born artist, and even spread over two museums it's of a piece: crowded, agitated, funny and political. Ms. Rosler was involved in the peace movement and feminism in the 1960's and responded with art that combined moral brashness and a television-generation sense of the absurd. Aware of the co-opting power of the market, she chose mediums that were either ephemeral or easily reproduced and distributed. The show mixes all of them together, with video and photography -- her best work -- concentrated uptown and installations (including a cash-and-carry garage sale) at the New Museum. Despite her self-description as a ''ham-fisted'' artist, her work is full of subtleties. It may have little to say to a viewer for whom taste, style and beauty are the exclusive building blocks of art, but as an art of ideas that lead to actions, its deeply skeptical utopianism is as vital now as it was in the past. Hours and admission at the New Museum: See above. Hours at the International Center of Photography: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Center admission: $6; $4 for students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>DON GUMMER, Salander O'Reilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606 (through Sept. 30). In Mr. Gummer's Cubist bronze sculptures, boxes, rods and slatted planes are caught up in antigravitational tension between geometric order and dynamic flux. Pushed to more expansive extremes, the possibilities could be interesting, but these works, with their stained-glass accents, are restrained by decorative decorum (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''PORTRAITS OF LEO,'' Leo Castelli, 59 East 79th Street, (212) 249-4470 (through Oct. 7). This tasteful memorial show presents an assortment of affectionate portraits by artists who were supported and promoted by the gallery's founder, Leo Castelli, who died a year ago. It includes a candy-colored picture by Andy Warhol; a small, rumpled photograph of the dealer in a halo of light by Mike and Doug Starn; an amusingly kitschy ceramic head by Meyer Vaisman; the dealer's name spelled in green neon by Bruce Nauman; his ghostly image seen through a jigsaw puzzle screen by Jasper Johns; and an Abstract Expressionist likeness made by Elaine de Kooning in 1954 (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>KATY GRANNAN, ''Dream America,'' Lawrence Rubin, Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0444 (through Sept. 30). In her first solo exhibition, this member of a new wavelet of young, adventurous female photographers presents a series of large portraits of ordinary, unnamed, mostly unclothed people in their own homes. Subjects answered ads for art models placed by the artist in small city newspapers. One may detect a note of hip condescension in Ms. Grannan's Pop-Conceptualist approach, but the images themselves have a vivid, unvarnished immediacy (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ROBERT POLIDORI, Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999 (through Oct. 14) In its visual sumptuousness and oblique sociology, Mr. Polidori's architectural photography calls to mind photographers like Andreas Gursky or Thomas Struth. His images of ruined palatial interiors in Palm Springs or Havana are cinematically gripping; his picture of a room in Beirut with a bullet-pocked yellow wall and blue sky showing through another blown-out wall is like a terrible but beautiful dream (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>''PARADISE NOW: PICTURING THE GENETIC REVOLUTION,'' Exit Art, 548 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-7748 (through Oct. 28). ''We are at a threshold,'' declares the text panel at the start of this show. And we are, you know. Never mind that the art mostly isn't great because with more and more artists tapping into science, something big is bound to happen soon. Think of this as a preliminary report. The works span a decade and run the gamut from paintings and sculptures to the collecting of sperm and the breeding of very tiny exotic frogs. The artists fret predictably about tampering with Mother Nature and stress identity politics, also predictably, but the spirit of the show, an intangible, tips the scales in a positive direction. Scientists may be doing the crucial research but artists are going to have to help us make sense of it all, the progress of humanity depending historically on a tandem of science and culture (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>RICHARD MISRACH, ''Skies,'' Curt Marcus Gallery, 578 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 226-3200 (through Oct. 14). You might mistake Mr. Misrach's enormous color photographs of nothing but skies shot at various times and in various desert locations for extremely subtle Color Field paintings. Fading from pale yellow to deep purple, or from smoldering orange to velvety blue, the 6-by-7 1/2-foot prints are at once romantic celestial visions and materialist essays in the modulation of color and tone. They occupy the gallery with Rothkoesque gravitas (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''SELECTIONS FALL 2000,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166 (through Oct. 14). The center's latest show of emerging artists focuses on schematic drawing. It includes Mary Lum's cutout and layered, painted line images of buildings; Lucas Monaco's crystalline transparent street maps; Oona Stern's cartoon wood floor; a mural by Geraldine Lau that resembles an air traffic map; architectural and topographical fragments finely inked and layered by Julie Mehretu; Miranda Maher's semitransparent stacks of utilitarian illustrations; Glenn Grafelman's smudgy fenestration drawings; and photographs of Grady Gerbracht that trace passing scenes on a bus window (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CORBAN WALKER, Pace, 142 Greene Street, (212) 431-9224 (through Oct. 7). For his first New York solo exhibition, this Irish sculptor leaned more than 50 gleaming 14-foot-long plate glass planks at various angles along two of the gallery walls. Elsewhere, narrow horizontal mirrors and a viewing slot cut through a column at the diminutive sculptor's actual eye level -- four feet -- urge us to think about space, perception and cognition. But the effect of the whole is more elegantly decorative than rigorously formal or intellectual (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>SLATER BRADLEY, ''Charlatan,'' Team Gallery, 527 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-9219 (through Oct. 17). This impressive show presents four brief video projections by an artist completely at ease with his medium, attuned to its various roles in contemporary life and willing to try something different every time he picks up the camera. Each of the works here has its own look, intensity and revelation. Together they form a mesmerizing meditation on obsession, death and the possibilities of art (Smith).</p>
        <p>ROB DE MAR, Clementine, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-5937 (through Oct. 7). Covered in colored flocking and supported by veiny metal armatures that connect grassy knolls, roadways, clouds, ponds and waterfalls, Mr. de Mar's toylike landscapes hover expansively out from the gallery's walls. With comic nostalgia, they evoke pastoral dreams of parkway bliss. Small metal houses erected on tall poles and used by the artist for target practice are not so trippy (Johnson).</p>
        <p>BARRY GOLDBERG, Howard Scott, 529 West 20th Street, (646) 486-7004 (through Oct. 7). This Philadelphia-based painter makes sensuously appealing abstractions combining near-Minimalist graphic design and waxy or streaky surfaces. With their hard-edged, round-cornered rectangles and sherbet colors, they evoke nostalgia for the purist modernism of the 1960's (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MARK INNERST, Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474 (through Oct. 7). In glossy, vertical paintings of New York City, with dark skyscrapers divided by slots of luminous sky, Mr. Innerst continues to explore a slightly ironic poetry of nostalgic beauty. Up close, the simplified realism melts into layers of watery glazes, enhancing tension between image and abstraction (Johnson).</p>
        <p>YOSHIO ITAGAKI, Cristinerose, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-0297 (through Sept. 30). Through the miracle of digital technology, this Japanese-born New York artist produces oddly banal photomontages depicting ordinary tourists on the moon, with the earth looming over the horizon in every case. In another series, tourists are inserted into video game scenes. Something about the disconnected rootlessness of modern life is implied, but these works are less amusing than they should be (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* JOHN MORRIS, D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460 (through Sept. 30). This Queens native works like a spider, spinning webs of wonderfully intricate doodling in graphite, ink, colored pencil and other materials. Eye-strainingly fine circles, arabesques, spirals, and ovals are organized around and within larger structures like yin-yang compositions or leaf or egg forms, creating a joyful cosmic vision of organic growth and a layered complexity like that of Baroque music (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ALICE NEEL, ''The Last Years,'' Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774 (through Oct. 14). Late portrait paintings and a fine, small drawing retrospective complement the Whitney's recent Alice Neel retrospective. Some of the most arresting paintings are of children. The ghoulish-looking Jonathan in the arms of his father, Don Perlis, radiates demonic energy. The 15 drawings on paper, from the smoothly penciled ''Sam'' to the densely hatched ''Phil'' to the almost Minimalist ''Andy Warhol,'' argue persuasively for a more extensive show of drawings (Johnson).</p>
        <p>RAM RAHMAN, Admit One, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 463-0164 (through Oct. 7). Through busy documentary images from New Delhi, New York, Paris, Mexico and other places, this canny photographer projects a lively global perspective. Groups of obliquely related black-and-white pictures -- a statue of Queen Victoria juxtaposed with a row of Indian drag queens, for example -- turn out to be loaded with formal and pictorial complexities: compositional parallels, puns, odd shifts of scale, political ironies and sly sexual innuendo (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ALAN SHIELDS, Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105 (through Oct. 7) and Nicholas Davies, 23 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 243-6840 (through Oct. 14). Intricate constructions of chicken wire, dipped in paper pulp and brightly painted with watercolors, fill these two galleries with a playful, exotic festivity that is grounded in formalist materialism. Mr. Shields has long worked at mixing abstraction and decorative patterning; with his pop-out mandalas, suspended cages, space wheels and other Constructivist contraptions, he looks to be at the top of his game (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CYNTHIA SISSON, Audiello, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 675-9082 (through Oct. 14). For her first New York solo show, this young painter produced a kind of abstract eroticism. Flat, biomorphic shapes evoking the body are layered over diaphanous fields and entangled by carefully painted areas of floral or lacy patterning. With their pale, delicately muted pastel colors and satiny surfaces they seem an amalgam of Color Field painting, Indian miniature ornamentation and Victoria's Secret fantasy (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CHARLES SPURRIER, Feigen Contemporary, 535 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-0500 (through Oct. 14). Resplendent with beads, Christmas tree lights, collaged images, wood grain paper and, in one case, car fresheners, the 10 paintings here argue noisily that Mr. Spurrier's idiosyncratic painting technique -- which involves surfaces made of tautly stretch Scotch tape -- is as limitless in its possibilities as more traditional materials. But in the end, it is the quieter works that win the point (Smith).</p>
        <p>BETTINA VON ZWEHL, Lombard-Freid Gallery, 531 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 967-8040 (through Oct. 14). Ms. von Zwehl, a young German artist living in London, is one of several young photographers who fit a strict Conceptual framework around traditional portraiture. For her first solo show she invited young children into her studio, dressed them in identical (black) clothes and let them take their own pictures. She then juxtaposed the images in pairs, matching or contrasting poses, expressions and appearances. The disarming results rely too completely on the emotional transparency of children while also resembling Gap ads (Smith).</p>
        <p>LESLIE WAYNE, Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, (212) 645-1701 (through Oct. 7). Paintings don't come much thicker than Ms. Wayne's. The artist layers paint into two-inch-deep boxes and then gouges into the still-wet oil with instruments or her hands, producing deep, multicolored gashes. In a whole-wall piece, scattered punctures and slashes colorfully bleed; the effect is at once prettily decorative and viscerally violent (Johnson).</p>

        <p>''PASTORAL POP!,'' Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453 (through Dec. 15). Nature-inspired kitsch is the theme of this delirious seven-artist show. It includes Rob de Mar's comical landscape in the form of a spindly tree, Lisa Ruyter's psychedelic update of Seurat's ''Grande Jatte,'' Alyson Shotz's grove of weird plant machines, Peter Gould's transformation of the guard station into a bucolic cartoon, Jason Middlebrook's Styrofoam stonewall planter, Katrin Asbury's miniature diorama in a planter and Rachel Feinstein's suspended Rococo-style pitcher exploding flowers like a pinata (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>SHIRLEY GOLDFARB, Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-1223 (through tomorrow). Like the first, held only two years ago, the second New York gallery show devoted to Shirley Goldfarb (1925-1980) leaves one wanting a fuller picture. Goldfarb, who spent most of her adult life in Paris, produced tenderly handmade paintings using incremental strokes of color applied with a palette knife. The mosaiclike results relate to contemporary efforts by Yayoi Kusama, Agnes Martin and David Budd; they are animated by constant flucuations of tone and space that can swing exuberantly between the literal and the optical (Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''MAKING CHOICES, 1920-1960,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Tuesday). The main event at the Modern these days is the museum itself. This has been the case since last fall, when the project ''MOMA 2000'' began the first of what will be three successive top-to-bottom reinstallations of the permanent-collection galleries. The affair has been billed as a test drive for the future, a chance for an institution to rethink the modern art tradition that it helped invent and to consider its own identity in what is often called a postmodern world. This second installment, which looks denser, weirder, messier and more truly modern (or maybe postmodern) than the first, is a big leap in the right direction. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''THE S-FILES/THE SELECTED FILES,'' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272 (through tomorrow). This museum has a policy of reviewing all slides sent in by artists, and for this group show the curators Deborah Cullen and Yasmin Ramirez selected submissions from the last year, making a lively assemblage. It has no overriding theme, and certain political and religious images automatically tagged as Latino are absent or at least played down. The results don't exactly constitute a post-identity gathering, but on the whole the show takes an oblique approach to social issues, exploring them by way of forms and materials. Work by Domingo Nuno, Juana Valdes, Fernanda Brunet, Alejandro Diaz and the artists who go by the names of Malika, Rabindranat and Vargas-Suarez Universal look particularly good. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
