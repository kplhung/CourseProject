        <p>A Manhattan development team that has made its mark on the Upper East Side with luxury rentals is hoping for similar success with condominiums.</p>
        <p>Later this month, the partnership of Trevor Davis, of Davis &amp; Partners, with Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs, of RFR Holding L.L.C., will open their latest project, the 194-unit Impala, as a condo, not as a rental as originally announced and as was the plan until recently.</p>
        <p>The project consists of a 31-story tower on First Avenue linked by a corridor and an interior courtyard to a seven-story building facing 76th Street. It is the first Manhattan high-rise designed by Michael Graves.</p>
        <p>When the project was announced two years ago, it also included a separate seven-story building with 29 units facing 75th Street and overlooking the courtyard. The cost to develop the three buildings, which fill a T-shaped site once occupied by a movie studio, is $105 million. That includes the purchase of air rights over nearby buildings, which enabled the partners to increase the height of the tower by 10 floors, to 31, and allowed light and air into the units.</p>
        <p>Today, the 75th Street structure has been retained as a rental and all of its 29 units are leased. Earlier this month, however, a sign outside the interconnecting buildings announcing 194 studio-to-three-bedroom units for rent in the two other buildings was changed to condominiums for sale.</p>
        <p>The entrance to the two condo buildings is on 76th Street, where a life-size bronze sculpture of an impala, the African antelope, stands guard. Fourteen more statues of impalas, in various groupings, decorate the 15,000-square-foot courtyard</p>
        <p>The partners have filed their condo offering plan with the state attorney general's office and expect it to be accepted by Nov. 1. They will then start sales.</p>
        <p>Preliminary prices for the 194 apartments, ranging from 474 to 1,865 square feet, are $400,000 to $3 million. Monthly maintenance costs are to be $292 to $1,155. Taxes, which will be abated for 10 years, will initially range from $44 to $172 a month. Without the abatement, they would be $194 to $753, according to the Marketing Directors, a Manhattan residential consulting and marketing concern and the project's sales agent. Buyers will be able to combine apartments to create larger ones.</p>
        <p>Explaining the switch from rental to condo, Mr. Davis said: ''We have a high-end product in a location that is growing in popularity at a time when rents are spiraling. So we felt consumers would rather buy than rent.''</p>
        <p>The partners first entered the sales arena with the Empire, a 76-unit condo nearing completion at 188 East 78th Street at Third Avenue. All but one of that project's one-  to five-bedroom units have been sold for $660,000 to $3.9 million. Though the partners debated for months whether to make the Impala a condo, ''the Empire's success helped persuade us,'' Mr. Rosen said. ''With this market, there is a need for this product,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another factor was what Mr. Rosen called the Impala's biggest asset -- that it is a completed building with apartments readily available. Buyers, he said, rarely have such an opportunity.</p>
        <p>Brokers agree that the Impala could work as a condo or a rental, given the strength of both markets.  But Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan brokerage firm, said, ''There are actually more rentals available on the East Side for buyers/tenants to see than there are condos -- the demand for which far exceeds the supply.''</p>
        <p>Neil Binder, a principal of the Bellmarc Company, another brokerage firm, said, ''It comes down to which line is longer, and now it's the ownership line.''</p>
        <p>Last year, 10 rental projects with 2,928 apartments were completed in Manhattan, compared with 8 condo projects with 723 units, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. On the Upper East Side, 3 condominium projects, totaling 98 units, were completed in 1999. This year, in addition to the Impala and the Empire, 3 other projects, with some 230 condos, are to be completed, the board said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, prices for East Side condos have increased. According to the Corcoran Group, the average sales price for all condos on the East Side reached $1.2 million at midyear, up 35 percent from the end of 1999.</p>
        <p>As for the Impala's becoming a condo, Ms. Liebman said: ''The prices are not inexpensive. If buyers perceive the project to be a rental passed off as a condo at condo prices, they'll pass on it. Buyers are too savvy to be fooled.''</p>
        <p>The apartments at the Impala, designed by H. Thomas O'Hara, a Manhattan architect, have such features as 9-to-11-foot-high ceilings and knee-to-ceiling picture windows. Some of the apartments also have terraces and those on the upper floors have river and skyline views.</p>
        <p>Among the amenities at the Impala are a business center, a children's playroom and a health club -- all on the ground floor across from the courtyard, which features a running stream and fountains.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graves, who designed the courtyard, also did the lobby, which has maple-paneled walls and a limestone floor. He clad the building's exterior with red brick and bluestone and put in large square windows, which, he said, make the building ''look like a big town house rather than a tower.'' The idea, he added, is to make residents ''feel like they are coming home.''</p>
