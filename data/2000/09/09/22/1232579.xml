        <p>If you've ever fretted that cartoon and video game action heroes and the toys they inspire might be having more fun than the rest of us, ''The Specials'' is here to reassure you that these wondrous saviors of humanity are just as insecure, envious, spiteful, dirty minded and power hungry as everybody else. Maybe more so. No, it ain't easy being a superhero. The strain of maintaining a squeaky-clean altruistic image 24 hours a day can be deadly.</p>
        <p>This clever wisp of a satire imagines an alternative world, dominated by competing clans of action figures (and the toy companies that support them), that looks and sounds a lot like any group of bored, spoiled Hollywood actors lolling around a movie set and griping about this or that petty injustice. And the members of the Specials have plenty to gripe about. They rank so low (maybe sixth or seventh) in the pecking order of superhero teams that they get everyone else's castoff feats.</p>

        <p>If you've ever fretted that cartoon and video game action heroes and the toys they inspire might be having more fun than the rest of us, ''The Specials'' is here to reassure you that these wondrous saviors of humanity are just as insecure, envious, spiteful, dirty minded and power hungry as everybody else. Maybe more so. No, it ain't easy being a superhero. The strain of maintaining a squeaky-clean altruistic image 24 hours a day can be deadly.</p>
        <p>This clever wisp of a satire imagines an alternative world, dominated by competing clans of action figures (and the toy companies that support them), that looks and sounds a lot like any group of bored, spoiled Hollywood actors lolling around a movie set and griping about this or that petty injustice. And the members of the Specials have plenty to gripe about. They rank so low (maybe sixth or seventh) in the pecking order of superhero teams that they get everyone else's castoff feats.</p>
        <p>The group is also painfully aware that its fans aren't the coolest dudes in school but a niche market of geeks and outsiders. When they're not busy performing heroic feats like saving national monuments from deadly pterodactyls, they're squabbling, backbiting and betraying one another. If they're not careful, the Specials could blow their lucrative, newly won deal to be turned into action figures by Kosgro Toys.</p>
        <p>Although ''The Specials,'' which opens today at AMC Empire, sounds like an animated film, it is a droll live-action Hollywood fable and satirical soap opera. The leader of the clan whose logo is a lightning bolt (reminiscent of Nike's) is a slightly soured Harrison Ford-like superhero known as the Strobe (Thomas Haden Church). Vain and self-centered, he never tires of forcing his teammates to listen to him recount his own illustrious history at planning meetings.</p>
        <p>The Strobe has reason to be on edge. His sourpuss wife, Ms. Indestructible (Paget Brewster), is cheating on him with the Specials' most popular member and resident charmer, the unctuously grinning Weevil (Rob Lowe).</p>
        <p>Among the more vividly portrayed members of the Specials are a blue-faced creature known as Amok (Jamie Kennedy); the Alien Orphan (Sean Gunn), an amorphous reptilian idiot with a dangerous appetite for booze; Eight (actually eight different people who share the same mind and robotically take turns filling in bits and pieces of sentences when they're in the same room together); and Mr. Smart (Jim Zulevic), who wears an elaborate contraption attached to his nose that enhances his sense of smell.</p>
        <p>The team's newest member, a starry-eyed fan who soon comes to realize that the Specials are not nearly as virtuous as their name might suggest, is the ingenuous Nightbird (Jordan Ladd) whose specialty is her knack for laying eggs.</p>
        <p>The story, such as it is, finds the underemployed collective going through an identity crisis. At an elaborate presentation by Kosgro Toys about the action figures based on them, the members of the Specials feel their image is being ridiculed. The Strobe, in a fit of pique, impulsively calls it quits. Meanwhile the debonair Weevil is being wooed to join the group's more elite rivals, the Crusaders.</p>
        <p>Will the Specials survive these internal stresses? All it really takes to remind them of how truly special they are is the news that the Pentagon is being attacked by giant ants and that all their rivals are too busy with other heroics to go to the rescue.</p>
        <p>Although ''The Specials,'' directed by Craig Mazin from a screenplay by James Gunn (creator and star of the 1997 cult favorite ''Tromeo and Juliet'') is almost terminally whimsical, it generates a steady current of humor, much of it off-color. Almost the second the movie's over, however, it is likely to evaporate in your mind.</p>
        <p>''The Specials'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has a lot of raunchy humor.</p>
