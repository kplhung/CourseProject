        <p>A videotaped confession by an aide who died last year accuses President Jacques Chirac of operating a slush fund through kickbacks while mayor of Paris.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac, who has been dogged for years by hints of corruption during his terms as mayor and as leader of his conservative Gaullist party, went on television tonight to dismiss the accusations as a ''fantastic story.'' He said the tape amounted to no more than producing ''a man who had been dead more than a year, laying out implausible events that supposedly happened more than 14 years ago.''</p>
        <p>The daily Le Monde devoted two pages today to what it said was a transcript of the tape, and French television also broadcast portions of it today. The newspaper described an hourlong session in which the former official in Mr. Chirac's Gaullist party sat on a couch in his shirtsleeves, detailing how he ran a huge covert fund based on kickbacks while working for Mayor Chirac.</p>
        <p>The official, Jean-Claude Mery, said the system collected about $5 million a year from developers who won government contracts to build housing. ''It was only under the orders of Chirac that we worked,'' Mr. Mery is quoted as saying.</p>
        <p>According to Le Monde, Mr. Mery made the tape in 1996 when he was a key figure in an investigation into illicit fund-raising by Mr. Chirac's Rally for the Republic party. The newspaper said that Mr. Mery contacted a journalist, Arnaud Hamelin of Sunset Presse, to help him make the tape and then left it in Mr. Hamelin's possession.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamelin told Le Monde that his instructions were to go public with the tape if Mr. Mery died under suspicious circumstances. He said that in the case of a natural death, which is what occurred -- Mr. Mery died of cancer last year -- his instructions were to do what he pleased with the tape, unless a member of Mr. Mery's family asked him to destroy it.</p>
        <p>Interviewed on television this evening, Mr. Hamelin said he had withheld the tape for a year because he thought that was ''a reasonable delay.'' Asked whether the tape had  purposely been released to make Mr. Chirac look bad at a time when his Socialist archrival, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, was slumping in the polls, Mr. Hamelin looked annoyed.</p>
        <p>''There is always something going on, no matter when you release something like this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But in his televised rebuttal tonight, Mr. Chirac suggested that the release of the Mery tape was the work of his political enemies, just like the recent rumors that he was suffering from cancer.</p>
        <p>''One hopes that this is not the way that some people have chosen to start the 2002 election campaign,'' he said. ''These allegations are shameful and a lie. Everything in this pseudomessage is baseless, a lie, slander and pure manipulation. That is all I have to say.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mery, who was a member of the Chirac party's governing committee as well as a developer, never confessed his role to the authorities, the newspaper said. He was never prosecuted for any crime, either, though he spent five months in jail while a magistrate pursued an inquiry into his role in party fund-raising.</p>
        <p>On the videotape, Mr. Mery described himself as a major player in the collecting and distributing of kickbacks, according to Le Monde. At one point he described a meeting in October 1986, when Mayor Chirac was also France's prime minister. At the meeting, Mr. Mery said, he handed $700,000 in cash to Mr. Chirac's chief of staff as Mr. Chirac looked on.</p>
        <p>''The prime minister sat in front of me,'' the transcript read. ''We spoke about who gave the money, when the money had been given, what we had done.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mery's accusations are the most direct so far against Mr. Chirac. But it is not the first time that scandal has touched France's gregarious 68-year-old president, who remains extremely popular.</p>
        <p>During his tenure as mayor from 1977 to 1995, Paris became a stronghold for the Rally for the Republic, and there are several continuing investigations into the misuse of funds during that time.</p>
        <p>Pursuing Mr. Chirac in a criminal investigation is not possible, though. The courts ruled last year that he could not be prosecuted as long as he was president. The court decision was prompted by an investigation that seemed to link him to the practice of paying party workers with government money.</p>
        <p>In recent years, all the major French parties have been hit by corruption scandals -- which suggests that kickbacks, padded payrolls, sweetheart contracts and all the other devices that have tended to accompany corrupt politics all over the world have been present here.</p>
        <p>In fact, in the videotape, Mr. Mery is quoted as saying that the money collected from the kickbacks was distributed not only within the Gaullist party, but to other political parties including Prime Minister Jospin's Socialists. Mr. Jospin said he would not have a comment on the tape.</p>
