        <p>Hollywood could learn a thing or two about how to be truthful and lighthearted at the same time from Nisha Ganatra's perky little comedy ''Chutney Popcorn.''</p>
        <p>The story of an Indian-American lesbian who impulsively decides to have a baby for her married, infertile older sister carries off the tricky feat of being wisecracking one minute and serious the next while staying true to its characters and sustaining a jovial easygoing tone. Here is one comedy that actually earns its mostly happy ending.</p>
        <p>As in any sitcom, beneath a surface cheer, the characters' relationships are torn by acute stress. The movie's likable but maddeningly stubborn main character, Reena (Ms. Ganatra), is a body artist and photographer who draws intricately beautiful designs on her subjects' skins and memorializes her handiwork in voluptuous photographic portraits.</p>
        <p>Although Reena and her lover,  Lisa (Jill Hennessy), are passionately monogamous, the prospect of Reena's pregnancy flies against Lisa's free-spirited, anti-bourgeois convictions. Reena's lesbianism is a thorn in the side of her strait-laced mother, Meenu (Madhur Jaffrey), an Indian traditionalist who condescendingly refers to Reena's sexuality as a ''disability.'' While barely acknowledging Lisa's existence, Meenu throws prospective husbands in Reena's path at every opportunity.</p>
        <p>The story begins with the traditional Indian wedding of Reena's sister, Sarita (Sakina Jaffrey), to Mitch (Nick Chinlund), a nice guy who seems close to the very model of an American man sensitized by the women's movement. But when Sarita discovers her infertility several months into the marriage, she is devastated and sinks into despondency and a sense of failure from which she never fully recovers.</p>
        <p>Out of the blue, Reena, without consulting Lisa, volunteers to have a child for Sarita through artificial insemination. Surprisingly, Mitch, who has his heart set on being a father, is much more excited about the plan than his wife. Even when Sarita realizes her sister is serious, her enthusiasm is halfhearted. The movie, which opens today at Cinema Village, goes on to stir up some mild farcical fun as Reena and Lisa carry out the unglamorous mechanics of artificial insemination and home pregnancy tests.</p>
        <p>''Chutney Popcorn'' seems entirely predictable until the moment Sarita changes her mind about wanting to bring up the child, and Reena, without thinking twice, announces that she wants to have the baby anyway. The movie doesn't flinch from portraying the resulting emotional tumult. Lisa, whose scalding derision of what she calls the ''Heather Has Two Mommies'' lifestyle, is forced to re-evaluate her relationship with Reena, while Mitch and Sarita (who is suddenly envious of her sister) must face a childless future and possible long-term damage to their marriage over her change of heart.</p>
        <p>Meenu's first impulse is to dismiss the plan as irresponsible and somehow immoral. But in a neat balancing act, the movie gives Lisa a supportive mother, Janis (Cara Buono),  who is almost as annoying with her intrusions as Meenu is with her disapproval.</p>
        <p>Because ''Chutney Popcorn'' knows its characters deeply enough to let them determine events, it rises above formula. It is also unusually well acted. Ms. Ganatra's Reena exudes a warm, pillowy sensuality that is complemented by Ms. Hennessy's frisky, high-strung hauteur.</p>
        <p>But the deepest and most complex performance is Ms. Jaffrey's Meenu. While it would have been easy to portray the mother as a snobbish, homophobic spider-woman, Ms. Jaffrey conveys the pained ambivalence of a devoted parent struggling with  her ingrained prejudices and sense of shame. For all her blind spots, she emerges as a ruefully funny life force who ultimately knows what really matters and sticks up for it.</p>
        <p>CHUTNEY POPCORN  Directed by Nisha Ganatra; written and produced by Susan Carnival and Ms. Ganatra; director of photography, Erin King; edited by Jane Pia Abramowitz; music by Karsh Kale; production designer, Jody Kipper; released by Mata Films.
