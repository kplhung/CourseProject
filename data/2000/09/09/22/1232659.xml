        <p>A top executive of the government corporation that guarantees pensions sat quietly in the back of a Senate hearing room today as witnesses said it appeared that he had improperly steered $40 million worth of contracts. Congressional investigators said the matter would be referred to federal prosecutors.</p>
        <p>Bennie L. Hagans Jr., the director of insurance operations for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, was not asked if he wanted to defend himself. The senators, according to their aides, were unaware of his presence.</p>
        <p>In an interview beforehand, Mr. Hagans called the hearing ''an insult.''</p>
        <p>David Strauss, the pension agency's executive director, defended Mr. Hagans, saying the awarding of two contracts to Integrated Management Resources Group to administer failed pension plans had been done in perfect accord with federal contracting rules and nothing was amiss.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Strauss said nothing about race, a significant omission since, in an interview on Wednesday, and privately for months before that, he had said that Mr. Hagans and Myrna Cooks, who owns Integrated Management, were victims of racists who had fed misleading information to investigators. Mr. Hagans and Ms. Cooks are black, while all the others involved in the matter are white.</p>
        <p>A report by Robert H. Hast, the assistant comptroller general for special investigations, showed that Mr. Hagans had taken various steps that he interpreted as steering the contract to Ms. Cooks, including talking twice to a banker from whom Ms. Cooks was seeking a $1 million loan to start her business and speaking to workers whom Ms. Cooks wanted to recruit away from another company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagans characterized his actions as the routine work of a federal executive dealing with contractors.</p>
        <p>The senators also heard from witnesses about what they called mismanagement in the Atlanta office of Integrated Management and about a nearly half-million-dollar check that was erroneously sent to a pensioner and other foul-ups.</p>
        <p>An actuary who worked for Integrated Management, Bonne Ann McHenry, described a slipshod operation in which Ms. Cooks paid no attention to details, incompetent workers were hired, employees were penalized if they pointed out flaws and she and others were shorted on their promised pay.</p>
        <p>She said that thousands of letters advising former employees of Pan American World Airways what benefits they were due gave inaccurate data and that no copies of the letters were kept. She also testified that when some workers complained to Mr. Strauss, he met with them, but then did nothing when one of them was fired and others were punished for speaking up.</p>
        <p>Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who was in charge of the hearing, said that despite recent improvements the agency was still a mess.</p>
        <p>Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said he thought anecdotal evidence of problems obscured ''an upward trend line'' in serving people in the failed pension plans the agency runs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Breaux also expressed doubts about the accusations of contract steering, saying in an interview, ''I certainly did not see any smoking gun, nothing suggesting anything criminal.''</p>
        <p>Senator Grassley said he learned of the racism issue the night before and saw no reason to bring it up at the hearing. If federal prosecutors conclude that the contract-steering charges are baseless, he said he would hold a hearing to examine whether racism played a role in the accusations.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cooks was not available for comment. But her lawyer, David W. Kuhnsman, complained that the hearing was ''patently unbalanced'' because his client had not been given a chance to defend herself. Mr. Kuhnsman said he welcomed the referral to the Justice Department because ''now we will have investigators who know what they are doing.'' He said he was confident that no charges would be filed.</p>
