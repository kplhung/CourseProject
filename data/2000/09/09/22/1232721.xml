        <p>After the 1997 season, Chuck Knoblauch forced his way out of Minnesota and into a trade to the Yankees. The next year, it was Roger Clemens who made a power play and ended up in pinstripes.</p>
        <p>Now another star is in a position to force a trade, and if the Toronto Blue Jays must deal the slugger Carlos Delgado, they figure that the Yankees will be among the teams in the bidding. Delgado, 28, is batting .356 with 54 doubles, 40 homers, 136 runs batted in and 113 walks; his slugging percentage is .685 and his on-base percentage is .476 -- numbers that place him in a remarkable bargaining position with the Blue Jays.</p>
        <p>Delgado has two years left on a three-year deal he signed after last season and is guaranteed $12.65 million for 2001 and $14.75 million in 2002. Delgado has the right to demand a trade after this season, just as Knoblauch and Clemens did, and if the Blue Jays do not swap him by Feb. 15, he would become a free agent.</p>
        <p>Delgado could use this clause to renegotiate a huge contract extension with the Blue Jays' new owners -- ''This is a great place to play,'' he said today -- or he could force his way out of Toronto and have some influence in determining where he is traded. Delgado has a limited no-trade clause that allows him to reject proposed deals to six teams; he is required, under the terms of the contract, to present that list of teams to the Blue Jays after this season. About half the teams in baseball would probably not be able to afford Delgado in the years to come.</p>
        <p>Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez has one year remaining on his contract, at $6 million, and his production has gradually declined over the last three years; the Yankees might decide to keep Martinez for next year, but they probably will consider possible replacements.</p>
        <p>Delgado is a left-handed hitter with a swing perfect for Yankee Stadium, and he is younger than Martinez. But getting Delgado would be tougher than it was for the Yankees to get Clemens because Delgado cannot control the trade talks the way Clemens's agents did -- and because the Blue Jays will probably have a large number of suitors for such a young star. Also, the Yankees' farm system is somewhat stripped down after the number of trades made this season.</p>
        <p>Delgado said he will not think about his contract status until after this season.</p>
        <p>The Yankees will resume discussions with one of their own players on Friday, when club officials will meet with pitcher Denny Neagle's agent. Neagle, a left-hander who could become a free agent after this season, said in July that he is looking for a deal of about four to five years, with a salary comparable to the $9 million a year the Minnesota Twins will pay Brad Radke.</p>
        <p>Mendoza Has Surgery</p>
        <p>A surgeon repaired a small tear in pitcher Ramiro Mendoza's right shoulder today, an injury that is believed to be the source of the weakness and swelling that has plagued the right-hander all year.</p>
        <p>Dr. James Andrews fixed a tear in Mendoza's labrum; Mendoza could recover in time to participate in spring training next year. Mendoza could either come back to be part of the staff in 2001, or, if he re-establishes his trade value, be included in a trade. Mendoza, who went 7-4 with a 4.25 earned run average in 14 games this year and was paid $1.4 million, is eligible for salary arbitration.</p>
        <p>Among active players, right fielder Paul O'Neill is expected to return to the Yankees' lineup on Friday. O'Neill, coming back from a hip pointer, has been taking batting practice and says his hip feels much better.</p>
        <p>David Cone, who allowed seven runs in three and two-thirds innings on Wednesday, spoke with Manager Joe Torre today about the decrease in his velocity since coming back after dislocating his left shoulder. Cone will throw in the bullpen at Yankee Stadium on Friday; Torre and the interim pitching coach Billy Connors will then decide whether Cone will make his next scheduled start on Monday.</p>
