        <p>This is the Dutch artist Rineke Dijkstra's solo debut in the United States, although her work will look familiar to anyone who saw her color photograph of a teenage boy on a beach that the Museum of Modern Art showed a few months ago next to Cezanne's ''Male Bather.''

        <p>Marian Goodman Gallery</p>
        <p>24 West 57th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>Through Oct. 28</p>
        <p>This is the Dutch artist Rineke Dijkstra's solo debut in the United States, although her work will look familiar to anyone who saw her color photograph of a teenage boy on a beach that the Museum of Modern Art showed a few months ago next to Cezanne's ''Male Bather.'' And some people will have watched her video of teenagers in nightclubs, recently screened at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>That video, ''Buzzclub, Liverpool, UK/Mysteryworld, Zaandam, NL,'' finished three years ago, has already been widely exhibited elsewhere. Now it's here, along with a series of photographs that Ms. Dijkstra has been taking since 1997: children, mostly adolescents but also a few girls around 7 years old, at the Tiergarten in Berlin and at a park in Lithuania.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dijkstra is an important new artist of a particular niche, and what makes her so, among other things, is how she conveys, in an intimate way and with unusual lightness and clarity, what it means to be an awkward teenager, without sensationalizing, a rarity.</p>
        <p>For the video, she visited two nightclubs, the first in Liverpool, dominated by 15-year-old working-class girls in skimpy dresses passing themselves off as 18; the second, in the Netherlands, a hangout for working-class boys with shaved heads, wearing matching hip-hop outfits. The girls smoke and chew gum at the same time. The boys, one or two zoned out on pills, have their own jerky style of dance.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dijkstra set up studios in the clubs and asked volunteers to dance one at a time in front of the camera, the contrast between the girls and boys, each assertive and vulnerable in equal proportion, being a subject of the video. They preen touchingly. Ms. Dijkstra also keeps the camera on them long enough to cause some of the masks to drop, at least a little. Time yields empathy.</p>
        <p>The photographs are large-format color pictures, akin to Thomas Struth's portraits but more casual, not chilly. The youngest subjects are posed against trees, looking at us in the way that little children do who are not old enough yet to feel self-conscious before the camera.</p>
        <p>The older ones look elsewhere. They are in the midst of something (it happens to be playing with a Frisbee, but we never see the Frisbee, only their rapt gaze), and like the teenagers in the video, they are deeply beautiful in their slight ungainliness. A boy in a Benneton T-shirt, the best picture in the show, is caught stepping forward, one shoulder up, alert, stiff, fresh, in a pose that seems like a metaphor for his transitional age. We know he knows we are looking at him looking away.</p>
        <p>The late afternoon light turns the parks into stage-set backdrops; at the same time the camera picks up minute details like the tiny shadow of lace on a girl's leg. These are heroic portraits, sweetly sympathetic, by a gifted and attentive artist.</p>
