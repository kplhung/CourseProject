        <p>Chris Miller, a professional ticket scalper from Chicago, says he likes to think of himself as an Olympic entrepreneur.</p>
        <p>This is not the first Olympic Games he has worked; he hustled tickets in Atlanta; Barcelona, Spain; and Nagano, Japan. He flew here several weeks ago. And like hundreds of other scalpers who have descended upon Sydney from the United States, Britain and other countries, he is part of an international nether world that buys and sells tickets for everyone from desperate fans to large corporations to national Olympic committees.</p>
        <p>''There's a ton of guys out here doing what I do,'' Miller said, pointing down Olympic Boulevard at dozens of scalpers lining the road. ''Look, that guy over there normally works Wrigley Field.''</p>
        <p>The scalping underworld, and the people and organizations it does business with, received unwanted attention today. The International Olympic Committee said it had started an investigation into accusations that tickets distributed to national Olympic committees of various countries, including the United States, had been illegally sold to a network of professional scalpers.</p>
        <p>Francois Carrard, director general of the International Olympic Committee, said: ''We have to investigate. We have to know the facts.''</p>
        <p>Mike Moran, a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee, said: ''The U.S.O.C. is not engaged in scalping tickets. If we found out that some governing bodies were scalping tickets, we would take some form of action.''</p>
        <p>Scalpers equipped with cellular telephones and walkie-talkies have taken their craft to a new level of sophistication here. They work in groups of as few as two or three people to as many as two dozen, buying and selling tickets around Olympic Park as if they were traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Some scalpers, like Brion Hargraves, hand out printed business cards with local cell phone numbers.</p>
        <p>Although the Olympic Games have typically been the most lucrative event for this rogue community, Sydney is turning out to be a disappointment. Part of the reason is that many spectators bought tickets before they arrived.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the legal standing of ticket scalping is confusing here. Buying scalped tickets is permitted, but selling them is not. The police are trying to make it hard for scalpers to congregate near Olympic events. Last week, immigration officials refused entry into the country of a man arriving on a flight from Los Angeles, because he was thought to be a scalper.</p>
        <p>''This is the worst Olympics ever -- I can't make a buck,'' lamented a scalper who identified himself as Eugene from Sacramento. ''Atlanta was a gold mine. You should complain to the Olympic committee. The venues are too far apart and the locals are not buyers or sellers.''</p>
        <p>The scalping world depends, of course, on imbalances between supply and demand. Scalpers typically sell to overeager fans and corporations, as well as to Olympic committees that seek surreptitiously to buy blocks of tickets to sold-out events. Sometimes, too, Olympic committees that want to sell blocks of tickets also resort to scalpers to help them.</p>
        <p>''It has been said, but never proven, that scalpers get tickets from national Olympic committees and official sponsors,'' said Milton Cockburn, a spokesman for the Sydney organizing committee for the Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>Scalpers were busy last Friday on the evening of the opening ceremony, which was one of the most sought-after and expensive tickets at the Games. Just two hours before the ceremony was to begin, a 25-year-old scalper who identified himself only as Trent, received a call on his cell phone from an intermediary seeking 20 tickets for a corporate client.</p>
        <p>Trent, who said he was from Philadelphia and had put himself through college by scalping tickets to Super Bowls, immediately sprang into action. Working the incoming crowds near the the Olympic Park train station, he and a friend offered as much as $489 a ticket. That was below the official face value of $750. But the scalpers knew there would be sellers, because many tickets for the opening ceremony had been given out free to Olympic committees.</p>
        <p>About 45 minutes before the opening ceremonies began, Trent hit the jackpot. A man carrying a manila envelope offered to sell 15 tickets for $325 each.</p>
        <p>''He's with the U.S. team,'' Trent said. ''He doesn't care what he sells them for. He dumps them on the market and walks away with a tidy profit.''</p>
        <p>Trent was also planning on a quick, lavish profit. He said he would tell the broker for whom he had bought the tickets that he had paid $540 for each one, enabling Trent to make $216 a ticket.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, the Sydney Olympic committee tried to make it tougher for scalpers, telling scalpers inside the Olympic Park that they were not welcome. Michael Eyers, the committee's deputy chief executive, said that scalpers found to be holding Olympic tickets would have their tickets confiscated and would be removed from the Olympic Park.</p>
        <p>According to the Sydney Olympic committee, 85 percent of the tickets to the Games' events, or 5.5 million tickets, had been sold by this week. Less than one million tickets still remain on the market, making it difficult for scalpers to sell tickets at a premium.</p>
        <p>''There's no middle,'' said Jason, a scalper from New York City who said he spent $5,000 to fly here. Jason said that, because so many tickets were still available at the box office, he could buy tickets only for amounts below the face value, and then sell the tickets at face value.</p>
        <p>Tickets range from as much as $750 for the opening and closing ceremonies to as little as $5.40 for some seats at baseball and soccer games. The only tickets that scalpers said they had been able to sell for more than the tickets' face value were for basketball games involving the American team. Those tickets, which sold officially for about $25, were scalped for as much as $160. Tickets for swimming also proved popular, although scalpers had a hard time fetching a premium for those seats, because of their already high face value of as much as $250.</p>
        <p>''I made 20 grand in Atlanta,'' Jason said. ''I'm already down 20 grand here.''</p>
