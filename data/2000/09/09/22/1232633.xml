        <p>Editorial on Jon Corzine's disclosure of his recent charitable contributions, noting that he gave more than $100,000 to politically active groups whose leaders or sponsors later endorsed him in New Jersey Democratic primary; finds that a 'bad taste' still lingers from Corzine's effort to win favor with state's Democratic orgn during primary by making contributions to local parties</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>After months of dodging, Jon Corzine, New Jersey's Democratic Senate candidate, has finally made public his recent charitable contributions. It was immediately apparent why he might have preferred to avoid disclosure. It turns out that Mr. Corzine, a multimillionaire who spent a record $35 million in winning the Democratic primary, gave more than $100,000 to politically active groups whose leaders or sponsors later endorsed him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine insists there is no connection between his charitable giving and his political campaign. But a bad taste still lingers from his effort to win favor with the state's Democratic organization during the primary by making contributions to local parties, lending credibility to Republican charges that the charitable gifts are part of a larger pattern by Mr. Corzine of using his personal fortune to buy up political support.</p>

        <p>After months of dodging, Jon Corzine, New Jersey's Democratic Senate candidate, has finally made public his recent charitable contributions. It was immediately apparent why he might have preferred to avoid disclosure. It turns out that Mr. Corzine, a multimillionaire who spent a record $35 million in winning the Democratic primary, gave more than $100,000 to politically active groups whose leaders or sponsors later endorsed him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine insists there is no connection between his charitable giving and his political campaign. But a bad taste still lingers from his effort to win favor with the state's Democratic organization during the primary by making contributions to local parties, lending credibility to Republican charges that the charitable gifts are part of a larger pattern by Mr. Corzine of using his personal fortune to buy up political support.</p>
        <p>His strange behavior has not helped the appearance problem. In April, for example, when members of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey announced their primary endorsement of Mr. Corzine, a reporter asked whether he had contributed to any of the ministers or their churches. Mr. Corzine stood by silently as several ministers made an angry denial. It now turns out that four months earlier, the family foundation through which he makes most of his charitable donations had given $25,000 to a politically important church in Orange  whose pastor is the executive director of the Ministers Council.</p>
        <p>Nor is this the only area where Mr. Corzine has been less than forthcoming. He has refused to make his tax returns public, insisting that he is prevented from doing so by a confidentiality pact with Goldman Sachs, the financial firm he once headed. The arrangement is so secret, he says, that he is barred from producing a copy of the secrecy agreement. With his belated disclosure of his charitable gifts, Mr. Corzine has revived concerns about his grasp of campaign finance issues, and about the extent of his political spending.</p>
