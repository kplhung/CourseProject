        <p>More than 100 voters jammed a tiny community center Tuesday evening to hear two Congressional candidates argue about who could do more for the military, the central question in Virginia's Second District, with five major bases and 200,000 veterans and their families.</p>
        <p>The Republican, State Senator Edward L. Schrock, said that as a retired admiral and a legislator he had the experience to get sailors off food stamps and to deploy a ''workable missile defense system.''</p>

        <p>More than 100 voters jammed a tiny community center Tuesday evening to hear two Congressional candidates argue about who could do more for the military, the central question in Virginia's Second District, with five major bases and 200,000 veterans and their families.</p>
        <p>The Republican, State Senator Edward L. Schrock, said that as a retired admiral and a legislator he had the experience to get sailors off food stamps and to deploy a ''workable missile defense system.''</p>
        <p>Jody M. Wagner, the Democrat, used a more personal touch, telling of her dismay when a Navy captain told her it would take 14 years to fix problems at his base at current budget levels and when she learned that newly assigned sailors with families were directed to the Women, Infants and Children aid program.</p>
        <p>But those in the room were the only ones to hear about it. The Norfolk Virginian-Pilot, which intensely covered arguments about when and where to debate, did not report the forum until the Schrock campaign sent out a press release highlighting Ms. Wagner's equivocation on supporting Senator Charles S. Robb, the embattled incumbent Democrat who is running for a third term. Area television stations ignored the event.</p>
        <p>With each of the candidates spending six or seven hours a day on the phone raising money, which may be what led them both to support a Common Cause pledge to ban soft money and provide some free television time, the race does not have high visibility here.</p>
        <p>The contest seems more vital in Washington, for it is crucial to Republican hopes of retaining control of the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>This district is one of three in the country where Republicans have serious prospects of picking up a seat being vacated by a Democrat. The others are New York's First District, where Representative Michael P. Forbes's defeat in the primary last week made Felix J. Grucci Jr. a solid favorite, and Pennsylvania's Fourth, where Representative Ron Klink's Senate bid opened an opportunity for State Senator Melissa Hart, a Republican.</p>
        <p>With the advantages incumbents have, from publicity to fund-raising to constituent service, open seats change hands most often. The Democrats come to this election with only 9 to defend, while the Republicans have 26.</p>
        <p>But if the Republicans can win these 3, then the Democrats need a net gain of 10 seats in the other three dozen contested races to win control of the House. The Republicans now have 13-seat majority.</p>
        <p>Virginia's Second District is hardly safe for Mr. Schrock, but it reflects a pattern widely seen in the last decade: Fairly conservative Democrats held on to seats that were shifting toward the Republicans, but once the incumbent retired, a Republican won the seat.</p>
        <p>This district looks Republican. Bob Dole carried it in 1996. Gov. George W. Bush has a double-digit lead in Republican polls. Eleven of the 13 state legislators are Republican.</p>
        <p>And winning this seat has meant holding it for a long time. When Representative Owen B. Pickett, a Democrat, announced his retirement last winter after 14 years, it became an open seat for only the third time in 54 years. His predecessors, William Whitehurst and Porter Hardy, served for 18 and 22 years.</p>
        <p>The most effective part of Ms. Wagner's campaign has been strong fund-raising. Starting late, in February, she raised $616,432 by June 30, the most recent reporting date. Most of the money came from within the district. Those efforts were boosted recently by a fund-raising letter from the popular Mr. Pickett. He wrote that Ms. Wagner's ''broad business experience and extensive participation in a wide range of activities in the community prove that she is eminently qualified.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Wagner's experience as a securities lawyer, a United Way officer and a board member of a medical school does not include much electoral politics. In Tuesday's forum she made no clear effort to compare herself favorably with Mr. Schrock. He repeatedly emphasized his experience as an edge.</p>
        <p>Her polls show that the district strongly favors abortion rights. She does, too, but Mr. Schrock does not. Yet she never brought the subject up. Asked why not in an interview today, she said she wanted to stress more important issues first. The abortion issue is a voter afterthought, or ''one of those p.s. issues,'' Ms. Wagner said.</p>
        <p>Nor has she run any television advertisements. She said she wanted to be sure to save the money to be on the air at the end of the campaign.</p>
        <p>But the low-key campaign may not work in a Republican district.</p>
        <p>''She's going to have to define herself and then sell herself,'' Mr. Pickett said.</p>
        <p>And Sonny Stallings, the district's Democratic chairman, said, ''She needs to get up on the air.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schrock has run television ads since early August, paid for out of the $748,421 he raised by June 30. The state Republican Party has sent fliers throughout the district for him.</p>
        <p>And while his campaign manager, Rob Catron, made headlines by saying the League of Women Voters, for whom Mr. Schrock would not debate, stood for ''the Communist Manifesto,'' the candidate himself speaks carefully.</p>
        <p>Republicans are confident. David Hummel, the district chairman, said party polls showed Mr. Schrock with a lead of more than ten points.</p>
        <p>Ed Matricardi, executive director of the state Republican Party, said the Second ''has been trending more and more Republican.''</p>
        <p>''If we do our jobs right and don't make mistakes,'' Mr. Matricardi said, ''we will win the seat.''</p>
