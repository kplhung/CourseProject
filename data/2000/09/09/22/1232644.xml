      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Dow Jones &amp; Company, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, said yesterday that Jerry Bailey, its chief financial officer, was resigning for ''unspecified family reasons.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey joined the company two years ago and was widely credited with a surge in shares of the company.</p>
        <p>''He was an important part of the Dow Jones story becoming real and financially dynamic,'' said Rudy Hokanson, an analyst who follows Dow Jones for CIBC World Markets. He added that Mr. Bailey brought financial discipline and credibility that ''the numbers and the story went together.''</p>
        <p>When Dow Jones first announced that Mr. Bailey was joining Dow Jones on March 30, 1998, its stock traded at $52 a share. It closed yesterday at $60.25.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bailey's announcement was unexpected, there were no other reasons for Mr. Bailey's departure beyond those publicly stated, said Richard J. Tofel, a spokesman. Peter R. Kann, the chairman and chief executive of Dow Jones, said that Mr. Bailey had been an extraordinarily effective agent of change and added that he was a ''valued colleague.''</p>
        <p>''In looking for a new C.F.O., we will really be looking for another Jerry Bailey,'' Mr. Kann added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey's reputation at Dow Jones was extremely strong with Wall Street. However, one staff member at The Journal said yesterday that when Dow Jones announced cutbacks in its pension benefits last year, many staff members viewed Mr. Bailey as responsible.</p>
        <p>Before joining Dow Jones, Mr. Bailey had been at Salomon Inc., where his record was mixed, according to two former Salomon executives. When he was named chief financial officer at Salomon, the firm was already reviewing its finances and shortly thereafter announced a $364 million loss. But three weeks later, Salomon said the loss was actually larger, and some members of management felt that as chief financial officer, he was responsible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey, who is 48, acquired $1 million in Dow Jones stock in the open market when he joined the company in 1998.</p>
