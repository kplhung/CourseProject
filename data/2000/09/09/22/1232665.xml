        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton has become so dependent on soft-money donations to promote her candidacy that it will not be easy for her to forsake them. She would have to rely solely on financing from her official campaign committee, which has lagged in its fund-raising in recent months even as it spends at a marked rate.</p>
        <p>The Clinton campaign had spent $14.9 million as of Aug. 23, according to its most recent disclosure filing to federal regulators. Only $4 million of that, or 27 percent, went to commercials, perhaps the most crucial item in a campaign budget.</p>
        <p>Several political consultants not involved in the New York Senate race said they were surprised that so little of her money had been used for commercials. As a general rule, a campaign should spend 50 to 80 percent of its budget on them, the consultants said.</p>
        <p>With most of the Clinton campaign's money consumed by salaries, travel and direct-mail solicitations, Mrs. Clinton has turned to advertising financed by soft money that she collected in league with Democratic allies in Washington and Albany.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's reliance on soft money helps explain why her opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, has pressed in recent weeks for an agreement to prohibit it in the contest. Yesterday, the managers of the two campaigns met at a Midtown hotel to negotiate one, with no success.</p>
        <p>The Democrats have channeled at least $5 million into soft-money advertisements praising Mrs. Clinton and attacking Mr. Lazio, campaign records show.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has not collected soft money, but some political committees and advocacy groups have bought commercials to aid him. Mr. Lazio's aides say those commercials cost a total of $350,000; the Clinton campaign puts the figure at $750,000.</p>
        <p>Donations to candidates' campaigns, so-called hard money, are limited to $1,000 for a primary and $1,000 for a general election per person, with unions and corporations barred from contributing. Soft money is collected by the political parties, and anyone can give, in any amount.</p>
        <p>The parties are supposed to use soft money for voter drives and other activities to build general support; technically, it cannot be spent directly to help candidates. The parties have increasingly sidestepped this rule by spending soft money on commercials that promote or criticize candidates without urging viewers to vote for or against them.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton appeared cautious yesterday in her comments about an agreement to prohibit soft money. She has said she will not renounce soft money until the Lazio campaign can guarantee that Republican and Conservative Party committees, as well as outside advocacy groups, stay out of the race.</p>
        <p>Asked whether her interest in an agreement was genuine, Mrs. Clinton said she had broached the issue before either of her Republican opponents, Mr. Lazio or Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who dropped out of the race in May.</p>
        <p>''I'm the one who called for it months and months ago,'' she said after an event in Buffalo yesterday. ''I called for it when the mayor was in the race, and I called for it as soon as the congressman got in the race. We're just going to see how it develops.''</p>
        <p>The Clinton campaign later released a statement saying that the talks would continue today but noting that it had ''real questions'' about how such an agreement would be enforced. During the negotiations, the two sides discussed appointing prominent politicians or campaign finance experts as monitors.</p>
        <p>The Clinton campaign is not alone in questioning whether an agreement can be enforced, given its voluntary nature. Some experts say these agreements often fall apart, and note that politicians often use them to posture, rather than to bring about real change.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's aides defended her spending, saying that her campaign was not typical. They noted that she had been on the trail for more than a year and as a first lady had attracted enormous attention from the public and press. As a result, the campaign had to hire an extensive staff.</p>
        <p>''Nobody has ever been through a campaign that has been at this level and intensity for this long,'' said Mandy Grunwald, a senior adviser to Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Ms. Grunwald said she was not concerned that the campaign would run short of money for commercials in the final weeks before Election Day. ''We will have the money that we need to do the job we want to do,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Political consultants not involved in the race said the spending on commercials by the campaign was unusually low. ''It's a lot of money to have been raised without having put that much on the air,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant in New York City who is not involved in the Senate race.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Lazio has not harvested soft money, fund-raising by his official campaign committee has flourished, in part because he has been able to reach out to donors around the nation who dislike Mrs. Clinton. In a seven-week period over the summer, he raised $10.7 million in hard money, while she took in $3.3 million. On Aug. 23, he had $10.2 million in the bank, while she had $7.1 million.</p>
        <p>Since entering the race in May, Mr. Lazio has spent $9.5 million. Of that, $3.5 million, or 37 percent, has gone to commercials. While that amount is also relatively low, Mr. Lazio had to spend much of the money he raised at first to set up his campaign.</p>
        <p>In Congress, Mr. Lazio supported legislation to ban soft money, but did not earn a reputation as a die-hard reformer. Democrats have noted that before becoming a Senate candidate, he raised soft money for Republican political committees in Washington.</p>
        <p>In seeking an agreement, Mr. Lazio's aides acknowledged a tactical advantage: it would cut off a vital source of money for his rival. That is one reason the Lazio campaign has swiftly tried to counter any objections to an agreement from the Clinton campaign.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton's aides pointed out that the New York Republican State Committee had indicated it would not abide by any agreement between the two candidates to bar spending by committees and groups outside their campaigns.</p>
        <p>By yesterday, after prodding from the Lazio campaign, the Republican State Committee announced that it would refrain from spending soft money on the race while the two campaigns negotiated an agreement. The committee has produced just a single soft-money radio commercial.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the New York State Democratic Committee, which has produced several soft-money television commercials to help Mrs. Clinton, released two more. One, to be shown in upstate markets, criticized Mr. Lazio's views on the upstate economy. The other, to be shown in New York City, seeks to link Mr. Lazio to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.</p>
        <p>Campaigning last night in Schenectady, Mr. Lazio called the party's actions ''shameless.''</p>
        <p>''It is the worst possible statement about their sincerity in terms of coming to an agreement,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
