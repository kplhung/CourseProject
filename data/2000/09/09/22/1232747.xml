        <p>Through Oct. 7</p>
        <p>With a probing approach that is both over- and understated, Jeffrey Saldinger paints a compelling theater of the self. In each of the nine self-portraits that make up the main body of his third solo exhibition, the artist adopts a dramatically exaggerated expression. Turning his round, bald head this way and that, he purses his lips, furrows his brow, puffs out his cheeks, looks angry, quizzical, amazed, fearful. He switches glasses or T-shirts or shifts himself halfway off the edge of the canvas.</p>

        <p>CRG Art</p>

        <p>Through Oct. 7</p>
        <p>With a probing approach that is both over- and understated, Jeffrey Saldinger paints a compelling theater of the self. In each of the nine self-portraits that make up the main body of his third solo exhibition, the artist adopts a dramatically exaggerated expression. Turning his round, bald head this way and that, he purses his lips, furrows his brow, puffs out his cheeks, looks angry, quizzical, amazed, fearful. He switches glasses or T-shirts or shifts himself halfway off the edge of the canvas.</p>
        <p>In contrast to these theatrics, Mr. Saldinger's painting is so restrained formally that it may seem bland at first. All the canvases measure 16 by 14 inches; the colors are severely muted and gesture is minimized. The apparently grayed-down dullness, however, gives way to a richly sensuous complexity. The grisaille palette turns out to be full of subtle color -- pinks, greens, yellows and slate blues -- and the handling of light and focus changes radically from one picture to another: one image shadowed and hazy, another crisp and brightly lighted, another frostily blurred.</p>
        <p>A searching quality emerges; it is as if the artist were trying to figure out who he really is but finds himself confronting a mystery with each new picture. In the one dated August 2000, his image barely emerges from the smudgy gray shadows, an elusive doppelganger. In another, even darker picture, he appears swollen by rage into a monster from his own worst nightmare. Self-portraiture too rarely achieves this kind of restless urgency.</p>
