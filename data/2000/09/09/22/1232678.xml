        <p>A huge building in the South Bronx that has been largely vacant for several years is to be taken over by a major Internet retailer in a move that will provide 900 jobs in the area, city officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The decision of the company, Webvan Group Inc., to move to Hunts Point comes as Internet and telecommunications companies are rediscovering former manufacturing areas in the city as ideal solutions to their space needs.</p>
        <p>''This is a huge deal for the South Bronx,'' said Fernando Ferrer, the borough president. ''It is the largest single shot of jobs in the borough during my public service, which goes back 20 years.'' And many of the jobs, he said, would be fairly well paying: $30,000 and more a year.</p>
        <p>Webvan plans to move into a nearly 10-acre single-story building at 331 Tiffany Street and use it as a distribution center for the groceries and other consumer items it ships to customers who place their orders over the Internet. The building was a distribution center for the Alexander's department store chain from the 1970's until it went out of business eight years ago.</p>
        <p>As part of the expansion into the northeast, Webvan, which is based in California, is also building a distribution center in North Bergen, N.J., a company spokesman, Bud Grebey, said.</p>
        <p>Although Webvan signed a lease for the 400,000-square-foot building in April, and despite the deal's economic benefit to the South Bronx, it had not been publicly disclosed because of problems in scheduling an announcement by city and state officials whose agencies played a role in bringing the company to the site by offering it incentives, one official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferrer said that the city's Economic Development Corporation played a major part by ''coming up with a package of incentives'' for the company.</p>
        <p>John Melia, a spokesman for Mr. Ferrer, said the agencies had agreed to provide benefits worth about $11 million to the company in the form of city and state sales tax abatements and reductions in property taxes.</p>
        <p>In addition, the company will get tax credits for every person it hires who lives in the area, he said, and the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, an affiliate of the borough president's office, will use its job data bank to help Webvan hire nearby residents. He said the workforce would initially number 500 and eventually grow to 900.</p>
        <p>The company's decision to move to the Bronx comes as the borough continues to enjoy an economic revival after the lean years of the 1970's and 80's, when it lost population, jobs and housing and became a national symbol of urban decay.</p>
        <p>''The addition of 900 jobs goes a long way to extending the Bronx's revival,'' Mr. Melia said. ''Attracting a company that is part of what many consider the new economy is a demonstration that the hard work that's gone into turning around the South Bronx is paying off.''</p>
        <p>Webvan's planned move to the area also illustrates how much in demand old industrial buildings have become for Internet-related and telecommunications companies.</p>
        <p>The old Bush Terminal on the waterfront in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, for example, is being converted into a technology campus. Other dot-com and telecommunications companies have been moving into industrial buildings in the Brooklyn waterfront area known as Dumbo and in Long Island City, Queens.</p>
        <p>Webvan has signed a 10-year lease for the entire Bronx building, with options to renew, said Lawrence Smith, an executive vice president of Sholom &amp; Zuckerbrot, the real estate firm that represented both Webvan and the building's owner, the Feil Organization, in arranging the lease. Mr. Smith would not disclose the rent.</p>
        <p>Renovations have already started. But while local officials said they expected Webvan to move in early next year, Mr. Grebey, the company spokesman, said, ''We have not announced a timetable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Grebey said that he did not know the average salaries that would be paid at the Bronx operation, but that the highest-paid workers would be the couriers delivering the ordered goods, who would be paid about $41,000 in their first year. All employees will receive stock options, he said.</p>
        <p>While complaints of truck traffic have been increasing from residents of Hunts Point, Mr. Ferrer said he did not see that as a problem with Webvan's operation. He said that the company's site was a ''straight shot'' from nearby highways and that ''the truck impact will be negligible in the residential area'' of Hunts Point.</p>
