        <p>On Oct. 3 Image Entertainment will release a boxed set of four DVD's with 50 films (45 of them never before available on video) culled from 18 film archives around the country and put together by the National Film Preservation Foundation.

        <p>There may well be no other project quite like it, not only in the history of home video but also in the annals of the motion picture. One eases into such a claim with a deep breath and fingers crossed, but judge by the facts.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 3 Image Entertainment will release a boxed set of four DVD's with 50 films (45 of them never before available on video) culled from 18 film archives around the country and put together by the National Film Preservation Foundation. Based in San Francisco, the foundation was created by Congress in 1996 to preserve America's film heritage. ''Everything but Hollywood,'' said Scott Simmon, a professor at the University of California at Davis who served as curator of the collection and wrote the informative and entertaining notes that appear in a 140-page book that comes with the set and is on the discs as an extra feature.</p>
        <p>The series combs the archives for 11 hours of shorts, documentaries and features made from the 1900's on and then salted away, so to speak, by an array of organizations, among them the Alaska Film Archives, the George Eastman House, the Japanese-American National Museum, the National Archives and Records Administration, Northeast Historic Film and the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
        <p>Judging by the results there is a huge body of film on every conceivable subject, much of it innovative and intriguing, shot mostly by people far removed from the filmmaking establishment, many of them amateurs. ''The idea was to show off the strength of the different archives, balanced with different kinds of films,'' Mr. Simmon said.</p>
        <p>There are little movies lasting only minutes. ''Demolishing and Building Up the Star Theater,'' produced in 1901 by the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, lasts 80 seconds. But the no-Hollywood stipulation doesn't disqualify the western. In ''Hell's Hinges,'' released in 1916 by the New York Motion Picture Company, William S. Hart stars as a ''reformable man,'' Mr. Simmon writes, ''who first reads the Bible entranced, cigarette and liquor at hand.'' It is the rare western that ends, in the words of the film's intertitle, ''while evil and madness join hands in the triumph of victory.''</p>
        <p>The newest film in the collection is ''Battery Film,'' a haunting nine-minute study shot in 1984 of Battery Park City in winter, preserved by the New York Public Library.</p>
        <p>''We're proudest of putting out some of the earliest avant-garde films,'' Mr. Simmon said. These include James Sibley Watson Jr.'s free-form and strange ''Fall of the House of Usher,'' made in 1928. Joseph Cornell's ''Rose Hobart,'' made in 1936, so infuriated Salvador Dali that he kicked the projector over.</p>
        <p>Finally, still in the avant-garde category, there is J. Stuart Blackton's ''Princess Nicotine; or, the Smoke Fairy,'' made in 1909 with special effects that puzzled even Scientific American. ''The little fairy moves so realistically that she cannot be explained away by assuming she is a doll,'' an article says, ''and yet it is impossible to understand how she can be a living being.''</p>
