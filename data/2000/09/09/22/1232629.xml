        <p>Joan Ryan Op-Ed comment on Olympics gymnastics competition, in which US finished fourth; holds US team, while it may have not won a medal, wins a gold medal 'in maturity' by fielding a team of older, rounder and healthier gymnasts, abandoning practice of having young girls subject to relentless training that could result in girls trying to stave off puberty, with some girls starving themselves and overtraining in race against time (S)</p>

        <p>As the Romanian, Russian and Chinese gymnasts waved their flowers at the crowd in Sydney this week, celebrating team victories in the Olympics, the American female gymnasts watched from the sideline. They had bobbled and wavered enough to finish fourth, dramatically short of their gold-medal showing in Atlanta four years ago.</p>
        <p>As I watched on television, I remembered back to Barcelona in 1992, when some of our teenaged gymnasts were so disturbingly thin and blank-eyed that a few sports columnists called for the sport to be banned from  the Olympics.

Some would starve themselves and overtrain in a race against time; they had to reach the Olympics before their bodies passed into womanhood.</p>

        <p>As the Romanian, Russian and Chinese gymnasts waved their flowers at the crowd in Sydney this week, celebrating team victories in the Olympics, the American female gymnasts watched from the sideline. They had bobbled and wavered enough to finish fourth, dramatically short of their gold-medal showing in Atlanta four years ago.</p>
        <p>As I watched on television, I remembered back to Barcelona in 1992, when some of our teenaged gymnasts were so disturbingly thin and blank-eyed that a few sports columnists called for the sport to be banned from  the Olympics. The relentless training of elite gymnasts meant that girls could stave off puberty. Some would starve themselves and overtrain in a race against time; they had to reach the Olympics before their bodies passed into womanhood.</p>
        <p>The results were sometimes disastrous. One elite gymnast died in 1994 from complications of anorexia. Another discovered 27 stress fractures in her spine from pounding her still-growing body day in and day out. Another trained for three years on a fractured wrist, too fearful to take any time off in her Olympic quest.</p>
        <p>But that was the price of winning. The physical skills of gymnastics were so demanding that only a body shaped like a missile -- a prepubescent body like that of Olga Korbut or Nadia Comaneci -- could excel. And producing such gymnasts resulted in what some experts denounced as nothing less than legal child abuse.</p>
        <p>So elite women's gymnastics, more than any other sport, pitted two deeply ingrained values against each other. On the one hand, we cherish children in our culture. We want to protect them, nurture them, keep them from harm. On the other hand, we love to win. Were we willing to risk losing in order to field a team of older, rounder, healthier gymnasts?</p>
        <p>U.S.A. Gymnastics, which oversees American training, has struggled with this question in recent years. It delivered its answer in Sydney. The United States fielded a team of adults, not children. They no longer looked like the pink ballerinas inside the jewelry box, tiny and fragile, spinning until they break. They looked like strong women athletes, and that is a victory in itself.</p>
