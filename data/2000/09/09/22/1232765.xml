        <p>Sunday 1 P.M.  Cincinnati (0-2) at Baltimore (2-1)  The Bengals, in their sparkling new stadium, lost the opener to Cleveland and then went to Jacksonville last week and suffered a 13-0 loss. The one thing the Bengals were supposed to have going for them was offense; that is Coach Bruce Coslet's forte. But Akili Smith has thrown one touchdown pass and four interceptions, running back Corey Dillon is averaging only 2.5 yards per rush and receiver Peter Warrick has not scored a touchdown. This Ravens defense is not one to meet under such circumstances. Ravens, 30-14</p>

        <p>Sunday 1 P.M.  Cincinnati (0-2) at Baltimore (2-1)  The Bengals, in their sparkling new stadium, lost the opener to Cleveland and then went to Jacksonville last week and suffered a 13-0 loss. The one thing the Bengals were supposed to have going for them was offense; that is Coach Bruce Coslet's forte. But Akili Smith has thrown one touchdown pass and four interceptions, running back Corey Dillon is averaging only 2.5 yards per rush and receiver Peter Warrick has not scored a touchdown. This Ravens defense is not one to meet under such circumstances. Ravens, 30-14</p>
        <p>New England (0-3) at Miami (2-1)  The Miami defense is clicking. It has three players with at least two interceptions, is allowing only 6.3 points per game and has allowed only one touchdown. It is quick and decisive. Credit Coach Dave Wannstedt and his staff for massaging this unit into a force. The Patriots thought their defense might play this way; they knew their offense was in trouble, just not how much. Dolphins, 20-13</p>
        <p>Tennessee (1-1) at Pittsburgh (0-2)  One of the reasons Tennessee soared to the A.F.C. championship last season was because it made a habit of beating Pittsburgh, the prior kings of the A.F.C. Central division. The kings now are Jacksonville and Tennessee. The Titans offer a reminder. Titans, 22-17</p>
        <p>Detroit (2-1) at Chicago (0-3)  The Lions have not gained what they anticipated from back James Stewart. Sometimes his runs look sluggish and he looks uninterested. He looks like the backup that he was in Jacksonville, not the exciting starter he was supposed to be. There is plenty of time for Stewart to change that, but not here. Chicago finally gets over the hump. Bears, 24-20</p>
        <p>Philadelphia (1-2) at New Orleans (1-2)  Joe Horn has caught 24 passes, the most in the N.F.C., and 12 more would break his career high for the season in catches. That is amazing and says plenty about the Saints' choice to pluck Horn away from Kansas City and about Jeff Blake's choice of a favorite target. The Saints play stiff defense and that earns them this victory. Saints, 16-14</p>
        <p>St. Louis (3-0) at Atlanta (2-1)  The Rams at this juncture last season had scored 100 points. They are flying on offense but have been scorched on defense, allowing nearly 400 yards of offense per game and no fewer than 24 points in each of their three games. Atlanta was outscored by 76-20 in two games against St. Louis last year. That is an average score of 38-10. A little closer this time, but expect similar results. Rams, 28-20</p>
        <p>San Francisco (0-3) at Dallas (1-2)  These teams have met in six National Conference championship games. Both are no where near that caliber now but still enjoy their rivalry. Is this Dallas team, not as talented as others, better off with the more mobile and athletic Randall Cunningham at quarterback than Troy Aikman? Sure looks that way. Cowboys, 27-23</p>
        <p>Sunday 4:05 p.m.</p>
        <p>Green Bay (1-2) at Arizona (1-1)  Brett Favre has never played at Arizona. After this long day in the desert, he will probably not want to return. Green Bay escaped an 0-3 start by slipping past Philadelphia, 6-3, in Green Bay. The Packers are not ready for this road test, especially since the Cardinals enjoyed a bye last week and will enter this game particularly fresh. Cardinals, 17-9</p>
        <p>Sunday 4:15 p.m.</p>
        <p>Kansas City (1-2) at Denver (2-1)  Elvis Grbac leads the league in touchdown tosses but Denver has been an opportunistic team and leads the league in turnover differential. If the Chiefs lead at halftime, watch out -- they have won 26 straight games when leading at the half. But the Chiefs are 1-3 in their last four at Mile High and will find it rough going stopping either Denver quarterback, Brian Griese (shoulder injury) or Gus Frerotte. Broncos, 28-24</p>
        <p>Seattle (1-2) at San Diego (0-3)  Chargers Coach Mike Riley has suffered plenty of bumps and bruises in only his second season, but he has been able to master Seattle and Coach Mike Holmgren. Ryan Leaf returns at quarterback for San Diego, and is this another bump and bruise for Riley? Probably not. Leaf should make good on his second chance this season as San Diego's starter. Check out the Seattle run defense, which allows only 2.8 yards per carry. Chargers, 19-14</p>
        <p>Cleveland (2-1) at Oakland (2-1)  It has been 21 years since the Browns played in Oakland. Cleveland can win its third straight game for the first time since 1995. The Raiders, though, have more speed, especially in back Napoleon Kaufman, who leads the league with an average of 8.9 yards per carry. Kaufman and receiver Andre Rison will produce big games. Raiders, 20-6</p>
        <p>Sunday 8:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>Washington (1-2) at Giants (3-0)  Brad Johnson has thrown more passes than any quarterback in the league. That, in part, is Washington's problem, along with the fact that Johnson hasn't done much with those throws (2 touchdowns, 5 interceptions). Who would have thought that Tiki Barber would have outrushed Stephen Davis by 326 yards to 283? And Barber has done it carrying the ball 24 times fewer than Davis. The Giants' defense is not going to let Davis run crazy. In fact, it wants to atone for that 50-point debacle vs. the Redskins last season. It will. Giants, 13-6</p>
        <p>GAME OF THE WEEK  Sunday 4:15 p.m. at TAMPA BAY</p>
        <p>Jets (3-0) at Buccaneers (3-0)  When the Jets and Tampa Bay connected on the Keyshawn Johnson trade last April, it ensured that this game would be a focal point of the 2000 season. It was a game to circle on your calendar, as Johnson did. Johnson has done his part to keep things spicy and the Jets have heard his noise from afar. The Jets, in return, have offered a tweak or two at Johnson, but in much milder tones. He made the Jets a better team and he has done the same for Tampa Bay. Johnson will make plenty of plays in this game. But it is the Tampa Bay defense that figures to rule. A great matchup, the Jets' offensive line vs. Tampa Bay's monster defensive front. Also, look for the Bucs to pick on Jets defensive back Marcus Coleman. Buccaneers, 23-13</p>
        <p>Monday 9 p.m.  Jacksonville (2-1) at Indianapolis (1-1)  The ball should stay in the air more than on the ground since this game features the A.F. C. 's top three receivers. Jacksonville has two of them in Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell while Marvin Harrison counters for Indianapolis. The Colts enjoyed a bye week and spent that time trying to work on turnover-free football (it is minus-4 in turnover differential) and trying to devise a way to make its defense stiffer. Fred Taylor returns at running back for Jacksonville, but the Colts will be too excited and prepared to allow any Jaguar to spoil a special night in the RCA Dome. Colts, 30-26</p>
        <p>Buffalo, Minnesota and Carolina do not play this week. All times Eastern.</p>
