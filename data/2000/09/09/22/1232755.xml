        <p>Marion Jones no longer needs to worry about Inger Miller in the women's 100 meters, and Cathy Freeman no longer needs to worry about Marie-Jose Perec in the women's 400.</p>
        <p>Two of the marquee races in these Olympics have lost some luster after Miller's withdrawal Wednesday because of an injury and Perec's mysterious departure from Sydney on Wednesday night. But there will be no shortage of starry matchups when the world's most important track and field meet begins Friday in the Olympic stadium.</p>
        <p>It will be Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia versus Paul Tergat of Kenya in the men's 10,000; Gabriela Szabo of Romania versus Svetlana Masterkova of Russia and Suzy Favor Hamilton of the United States in the women's 1,500; Angelo Taylor and Eric Thomas of the United States versus Llewellyn Herbert of South Africa in the men's 400 hurdles; Marion Jones versus Heike Drechsler of Germany and several others in the women's long jump, and Stacy Dragila of the United States versus Emma George of Australia and Anzhela Balakhonova of Ukraine in the first women's Olympic pole-vault competition.</p>
        <p>The list could have been longer and more interesting if Maurice Greene and Michael Johnson had managed to qualify for the 200. Greene, who holds the world record in the 100, and Johnson, who holds it in the 200 and 400, pulled up short of the finish line with minor injuries in the 200 final at the United States Olympic trials in July.</p>
        <p>That meant each will compete in only one individual race in Sydney, and also that Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, who trains with Greene, is now the favorite in the 200.</p>
        <p>''Ato hasn't been thanking me,'' Greene said. ''But I heard he had a big smile on his face after our race in the trials. I believe I would be the same. When you know that two of your toughest competitors are not going to be there, it makes it that much easier. But you still have to go in there and focus.''</p>
        <p>The same goes for Freeman, the Aborigine who is enormously popular in Australia. She is now the heaviest of favorites in the 400, which will be contested Monday night.</p>
        <p>Since losing to Perec at the 1996 Atlanta Games, Freeman has won 41 of 42 finals in the 400 and has the year's fastest time of 49.48 seconds. Perec's career best is more than a second faster: 48.25. But since winning the 200 and 400 in Atlanta, she has struggled with motivation and her health.</p>
        <p>Perec's behavior upon arrival in Sydney did not project calm and confidence. She dashed past reporters at the airport and, rather than joining the French team, chose to stay at the Mercure Grand Apartment Hotel with her American boyfriend, Anthuan Maybank, who was part of the gold-medal-winning 4x400 relay team in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Perec then claimed she was harassed by an intruder in her hotel room on Wednesday. Late that evening, she boarded a flight with Maybank for Singapore. But Peter Hook, a hotel spokesman, said that Perec had not registered a complaint with hotel management and that police and hotel officials had found no evidence of an incident.</p>
        <p>In the Singapore airport today, Maybank was involved in a scuffle with a cameraman working for an Australian television network. Perec and Maybank were taken to a police station and questioned about the altercation before being released. After holding out hope all day that Perec would return to the Olympics, the French team announced that she had withdrawn from the Games and had flown to Singapore. She later boarded a flight to Paris.</p>
        <p>The French Olympic delegation said Perec's departure had nothing to do with drug tests and that she had not been subjected to an out-of-competition drug test before the Games.</p>
        <p>Richard Descoux, the national technical director of the French athletics federation, said, ''I think Perec is an athlete who deserves more pity than blame.''</p>
        <p>With or without Perec, competing in this Olympic stadium, with its open design, could prove challenging. September and October are Sydney's windiest months, and wind can be a major distraction in precision field events like the pole vault and the high jump. It can also frustrate sprinters in search of eye-catching legal times.</p>
        <p>''If the Olympics were held in a hurricane, I'd still run,'' said Greene, who has the year's four fastest times in the 100 and has predicted victory here. ''The first one to the finish line still gets the gold.''</p>
        <p>It is difficult to imagine any conditions in which Jones would not win the 100, the first event of her quest for five gold medals in Sydney. She has not lost at that distance since 1997, and unlike Greene, the dominant force in the men's 100, she has won this year even when she has started poorly.</p>
        <p>Even if Miller had not strained her hamstring and withdrawn from the 100, she would have had little chance of outrunning Jones. Ekaterina Thanou of Greece, perhaps the next best sprinter in the field, has little chance, as well.</p>
        <p>Miller hopes to be healthy enough to face Jones in the 200 and compete with her in the 4x100 relay, which the Americans are strong favorites to win.</p>
        <p>INSIDE TRACK</p>
        <p>On the first day of competition, MAURICE GREENE and MARION JONES opened their campaigns to win the men's and women's 100 meters by qualifying comfortably for the second round. Greene won his heat in 10.31 seconds, which was only the 13th fastest time of the first round but allowed him to advance. Jones easily won her heat in 11.2 seconds. . . . BRUNY SURIN of Canada, the silver medalist in last year's world championships, had the closest call in the men's 100 qualifying. He finished fourth in his heat in 10.41 seconds. The top three finishers in each heat qualified, along with those who have the next seven best times. Surin's time was the seventh best by only thousandths of a second. His Canadian teammate, the reigning Olympic champion DONOVAN BAILEY, struggled but qualified in 10.39.</p>
        <p>ROBERT KORZENIOWSKI of Poland was awarded the gold medal in the 20-kilometer walk after the original winner by a second, BERNARDO SEGURA of Mexico, was disqualified for breaking contact with the ground three times. . . . In the women's 800's first round, the world champion, LUDMILA FORMANOVA of the Czech Republic, failed to finish her heat because of an ankle injury.</p>
