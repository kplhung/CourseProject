        <p>Japan is being swept these days by a craze known as DoCoMo. A DoCoMo is a small, colorful, palm-held cell phone, with a tiny screen that provides both voice connections and wireless Internet access. It seems lately that everyone here -- from Japanese housewives to bureaucrats to teenagers -- is buying one to surf the net, gossip, swap e-mails and photos, listen to music, tell fortunes, play games, make dates or sell stocks.</p>

        <p>Beware, America, especially you parents of teenagers. If you come to Japan you can glimpse the future. It's all thumbs.</p>
        <p>Japan is being swept these days by a craze known as DoCoMo. A DoCoMo is a small, colorful, palm-held cell phone, with a tiny screen that provides both voice connections and wireless Internet access. It seems lately that everyone here -- from Japanese housewives to bureaucrats to teenagers -- is buying one to surf the net, gossip, swap e-mails and photos, listen to music, tell fortunes, play games, make dates or sell stocks.</p>
        <p>Fortune magazine just reported that the number of DoCoMo phones in Japan is growing by 50,000 a day -- in many urban families each member has one -- and said that it looked ready to become ''the biggest consumer phenomenon to emerge from Japan since Sony's Walkman.'' Indeed, so many DoCoMo's are being sold, and Japanese youth are running up such big phone bills with DoCoMo's parent NTT, that Nissan recently ran an ad pointing out to Japanese youths that for the same money they are spending each month using their DoCoMo's they could cover the monthly payments on a new car.</p>
        <p>But DoCoMo is not just a raging Japanese urban fad; it's a glimpse at America's future. Japan is a year or two ahead of America in the deployment of wireless Internet-surfing phones. So DoCoMo Japan is giving us our first real glimpse of what the age of the ''Evernet'' will look like in a developed society. The Evernet age is what comes after the Internet age. The Evernet age is when you will be able to be online everywhere all the time, not just from your PC. It's a mixed picture, at best.</p>
        <p>If you want to know how it looks, ride the Tokyo subway. I sat next to a Japanese schoolgirl on the Hibya Line, who held her DoCoMo in the palm of her hand, gripping it with four fingers, and then with her free thumb pecked out messages using the numeric/letter keys and special symbols, such as a beating heart, which means ''I can't wait.'' Her thumb moved around the keyboard with the lightning dexterity of Midori playing a violin concerto. ''We call it thumb culture,'' said Yumiko Hayashi, my translator. ''It's really frightening sometimes being on the subway and watching all these people talking on cell phones with their thumbs.''</p>
        <p>As for its social implications, I interviewed a group of Japanese students the other day and our talk eventually drifted to DoCoMo. Yusuke Katayose, 20 years old, from Tokyo University, explained that many people he knows use their DoCoMo's to participate in chat rooms related to their hobbies. Eventually, he said, when friendships are forged, people will arrange an ''offkai'' -- Japanese slang for a meeting offline. That's right, now meeting online is normal and meeting offline -- i.e., in person -- has its own term. ''With the mobile phone you would communicate densely and freely with people whom you are comfortable with,'' said Mr. Katayose, ''but for an offkai you have to muster courage to actually meet.''</p>
        <p>Mika Owada, 19, from Sophia University, said that when her family lived in London without cell phones, they spent a lot of time together around the dinner table. ''Now,'' she said, ''after we have our meal we go back to our rooms with our own DoCoMo's and Internet, so we have less time to spend with the family. People use their own private links with the world, so they don't look back and depend on their family as much anymore.''</p>
        <p>Japanese translators are always discreet, but after translating my talks with the students, Mrs. Hayashi burst out with her own story. ''My own son -- he's in high school -- sends me e-mails on his DoCoMo asking what's for dinner,'' she complained. ''As a parent, I deeply deplore the situation. My son is 17 and he seems to have a girlfriend, but I'm not sure, because it seems that they don't meet each other so much, they usually communicate over the e-mail. There are so many things you can learn from human physical contact, but this younger generation is losing these interpersonal skills.''</p>
        <p>Maybe that's one reason, opined Mrs. Hayashi, that Japan has had a recent wave of teenage crimes, including a boy who murdered his mother. ''Young people think life is like computer games,'' she said. ''If they press the reset button, even after they kill someone, they think they can just reset their life from scratch.''</p>
        <p>Such is the age of the Evernet -- thumbs up and thumbs down, but ready or not, here it comes.</p>
