        <p>Margeotes/Fertitta &amp; Partners in New York said yesterday that it had acquired Bratskeir &amp; Company in New York, a public relations agency, for undisclosed terms.</p>
        <p>Bratskeir, with 30 employees and billings estimated at $4.5 million from clients like Chiquita, Hasbro and 1-800-Flowers.com, will operate as an autonomous unit of Margeotes/ Fertitta. Stan Bratskeir, 55, continues as president.</p>
        <p>This was the second acquisition in less than a month for Margeotes/ Fertitta, which is majority-owned by the Maxxcom unit of the MDC Corporation, coming after the acquisition of Chinnici Direct in New York. Chinnici was merged with the Margeotes/Fertitta direct marketing unit to form an agency named Pavlika Chinnici Direct.</p>
        <p>Also yesterday, the WPP Group in London acquired a minority investment in the Medical Broadcasting Company in Philadelphia, which offers digital marketing services to the pharmaceutical and health care industries. Terms were not disclosed. Medical Broadcasting will operate as an interactive partner of the WPP health care unit, CommonHealth, in Parsippany, N.J.</p>
