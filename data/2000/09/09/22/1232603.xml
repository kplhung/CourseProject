        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Bob Herbert, in his Sept. 18 column about the role of prosecutors in the criminal justice system, concludes that ''this is a system that needs to be changed.''</p>
        <p>He appears to believe that in many cases where there is a witness who cooperates in exchange for a lesser plea on a pending case, ''the innocent are wrongly convicted and imprisoned.'' Yet as Mr. Herbert notes, Detective Zaher Zahrey, whose case was investigated by my office, was acquitted after a jury trial.</p>
        <p>Regarding Mr. Herbert's reference to cases in which Dana Garner testified, there were three. In the Jeffrey Blake case, as soon as we suspected that Mr. Garner had lied, we conducted our own investigation and as a result joined with the Legal Aid Society to have Mr. Blake's conviction set aside.</p>
        <p>KEVIN DAVITT  Director of Public Information  Office of the District Attorney  Kings County  Brooklyn, Sept. 18, 2000</p>
