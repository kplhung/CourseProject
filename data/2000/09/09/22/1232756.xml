        <p>The United States Navy has named Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, to handle advertising to support efforts to recruit and retain personnel. The Navy plans to spend $40 million to $50 million in the next year.</p>

        <p>The New York office of BBDO Worldwide, which had handled most of the account, did not take part in a mandated review. The review, which lasted six months, had been narrowed to Campbell-Ewald and four other finalists: Bates USA in New York, part of the Bates Worldwide unit of the Cordiant Communications Group; Hill &amp; Knowlton in Washington, part of the WPP Group, in cooperation with a group of smaller agencies across the country; Rapp Collins Worldwide in New York, in partnership with Martin/Williams Advertising in Minneapolis, which, like BBDO, are owned by the Omnicom Group; and Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising in New York. Rapp Collins had also worked on the account with BBDO.</p>
