        <p>Deutsche Bank A.G., the largest bank in Germany, appointed a Swiss investment banker today to succeed its chief executive, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, who is scheduled to retire in 2002.</p>
        <p>Josef Ackermann, a former chairman of Credit Suisse who jumped to Deutsche Bank in 1996, had been considered a strong contender to succeed Mr. Breuer. But the early announcement, so far in advance of Mr. Breuer's retirement, was surprising and may reflect a shifting balance of power at Deutsche Bank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ackermann, 52, has overseen Deutsche Bank's investment banking operations since his arrival and was in charge of integrating Bankers Trust after the Germans bought it for $10 billion nearly two years ago.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ackermann also clashed with Mr. Breuer and played an important role in the collapse of Deutsche Bank's proposed merger this year with Dresdner Bank. It was Mr. Ackermann and several of his top executives who insisted that Deutsche Bank either sell or close most of Dresdner's investment banking arm, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, a position that contradicted Mr. Breuer's contention that Dresdner was ''a jewel.''</p>
        <p>Confronted with intense opposition from his own executives, Mr. Breuer reversed himself and went along with Mr. Ackermann and his American head of global markets, Edson Mitchell. That, in turn, outraged Dresdner Bank's top executives and eventually prompted Dresdner to walk away from the deal altogether. Since then, Mr. Mitchell and another American investment banker, Michael Phillip, have been elevated to Deutsche Bank's executive board -- a remarkable display of Deutsche's increasingly non-German identity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Breuer, who is 62, had already made clear that he would step down as chief executive by the time he reached the bank's mandatory retirement age.</p>
        <p>But he endured intense criticism as a result of the failed merger with Dresdner, and was so secretive in the dealings that even top executives like Mr. Ackermann knew little about the deal until it was ready to be announced.</p>
        <p>Mr. Breuer has been praised, though, for Deutsche Bank's successful acquisition of Bankers Trust. Defying investor skepticism, the merger has been unusually smooth, and Deutsche Bank's investment banking operations provide the bulk of the company's profit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ackermann, a nimble and quick-minded executive who has posed in some of Deutsche Bank's advertising, essentially took over Mr. Breuer's post on the management board when Mr. Breuer was named chief executive late in 1996.</p>
