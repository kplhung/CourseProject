        <p>Vice President Al Gore proposed a sensible policy yesterday to mitigate soaring gasoline prices and anxiety in the Northeast about the cost of home heating fuels. Coming seven weeks before elections, Mr. Gore's proposal is, as the Bush campaign charges, patently political. But Gov. George W.  Bush offers consumers little more than bromides.</p>
        <p>Crude oil prices have risen about 65 percent over the past year, to almost $40 a barrel. Ominously, stocks of the fuels used to heat homes primarily in the Northeast are down almost 20 percent over the past year. The danger is that dwindling reserves will trigger hoarding and speculation, driving prices even higher. Behind the problem lies the decision by oil exporting nations to keep output down even as worldwide demand rises in the wake of economic recovery in Asia and Europe.</p>
        <p>The United States cannot undo OPEC's decisions. But it can mitigate temporary price spikes by carefully exploiting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which holds almost 600 million barrels of crude oil in salt domes in Texas and Louisiana.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore proposes to open the reserve for ''swaps,'' a procedure that this page has already endorsed. The idea is to permit companies to remove oil from the reserve and sell it at current prices. That could put modest downward pressure on prices. But the companies would be required to return not only all the oil they remove but some extra amount, at a fixed date in the future. The reserve would thus be left larger than before the swaps took place. The only flaw in Mr. Gore's plan is timidity. He calls initially for withdrawals of only five million barrels. With swaps, the draw should be as large as needed to stabilize prices with no threat to long-term reserves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also called on Congress to create a permanent reserve for home heating oil in the Northeast, a sensible long-term buffer for a vulnerable area. He proposed early release of money for a program that subsidizes the purchase of home heating oil, propane or natural gas by poor families.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush opposes tapping the reserve. Instead he urges an energy policy that would promote oil exploration at locations including environmentally vulnerable areas of Alaska. He also proposes increased refining capacity and development of more hydroelectric power. Even if environmental risks could be eliminated, the proposal would provide no relief anytime soon. Mr. Gore's plan does.</p>
