        <p>A movie featuring Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman promises a battle of the aging titans, two men who still have enough fight in them to square off and throw the right punches when the clinch demands it of them. ''Under Suspicion,'' an update of the 1981 French psychological thriller ''Garde a Vue'' that has been moved to Puerto Rico, pits them against each other. Mr. Freeman is Benezet, a police detective with a complicated relationship with Henry Hearst (Mr. Hackman), a lawyer accused of the murder of two young girls.</p>
        <p>In Claude Miller's original, draggy and slight piece, the taciturn cop circled the upper-class worm and both men seemed to be sweating dirt. As the drab tension collected, the interrogation room seemed to get smaller with each passing moment.</p>
        <p>Although ''Garde a Vue'' is a film that Mr. Hackman has maintained an interest in remaking, there's an inherent difficulty in finding an American context for French thrillers, which often rely on attenuation and on squeezing air out of tight spaces.</p>
        <p>It is an approach that American movies have long since abandoned for the most part, perhaps because it's feared that it may make them look low budget. There's also an implicit lack of trust in the audience's interest in minimal dramas and in the actors' abilities to make them work.</p>
        <p>Swimming against this tide might be one of the things Mr. Hackman found attractive about ''Garde'' and impelled him to find a way to get it to the United States market. This is an admirable motive, and it's about all ''Suspicion'' has going for it.</p>
        <p>''Suspicion'' employs the kind of old-fashioned class distinction that puts the rich man at a disadvantage from the outset; he's got to be guilty of something, as the wealthy generally are in almost every movie in the  last 20 years, with the possible exception of ''Arthur.'' Mr. Hackman's Hearst has the pinched face of a man  concealing a secret badly.</p>
        <p>His much younger wife (Monica Bellucci) has been freezing him out, and she is incensed by his interest in her young niece. Mr. Freeman's condescension rises to the surface a little too quickly, and his grilling of Mr. Hackman as a child-murder suspect gives him an authority that translates into an arch superiority.</p>
        <p>The director, Stephen Hopkins, falls back on the security of over-scaled filmmaking technique, with cameras darting through the rooms -- which seem to be as large as much of San Juan, where the film takes place -- as if they were mounted on stealth helicopters. He tries to liberate his actors from the tyranny of the talking-heads syndrome, but ''Suspicion'' still appears to be a somewhat sinister episode of ''Nightline.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hopkins falls victim to the corny misconception of opening up a stagy piece by giving the characters elbow room within the large sets -- in this case, enough for Tiger Woods to swing for about 300 yards. He understands that the conversations need something, since they're mostly poses for the two lead actors to assume, stances that quickly disintegrate into shouting matches while Mr. Hackman and Mr. Freeman lock their jaw lines into grim countenances.</p>
        <p>Even after the surprise ending -- which isn't much of a surprise to anybody, although the two leads invest a great deal of energy in trying to stave off the plodding and inevitable denouement -- the sleaziness of the alleged crime makes ''Suspicion'' too pat a conceit; there's not much to be suspicious of.</p>
        <p>''Under Suspicion'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strong language and sexual situations.</p>
