        <p>Six weeks after it pressed Bridgestone/Firestone to recall 6.5 million tires, the nation's traffic safety agency said yesterday that it was considering opening an investigation of a second tire maker -- the Cooper Tire and Rubber Company.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sue Bailey, head of the agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said her office had recently become aware of lawsuits asserting that dozens of deaths and serious injuries had been caused by premature tread separations on tires made by Cooper, the world's fourth-largest tire maker.</p>
        <p>She said the agency was still examining data and had not decided whether to begin a formal inquiry, which could lead to a recall.</p>
        <p>A review of accident reports and court records by The New York Times shows that early tread separation in Cooper tires has been named as the cause of accidents that led to at least 35 deaths over the last six years.</p>
        <p>Although Cooper tires are sold as replacements on an array of passenger and light truck vehicles, the accident reports are strikingly similar to those in the Bridgestone/Firestone case, in which the safety agency says it has received complaints of about 100 deaths, most of them involving Ford Explorers.</p>
        <p>As in the Firestone case, nearly all the Cooper lawsuits involve a sport utility vehicle or light truck being driven along a highway in a hot-weather state at a high speed when the tread suddenly separates, causing the vehicle to veer out of control and then roll over.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman at Cooper, based in Findlay, Ohio, released a written statement strongly denying that the company's tires were defective or unusually prone to deadly tread separations.</p>
        <p>The spokeswoman, Patricia J. Brown, said the company had made an exhaustive review of its claims and adjustment data over the last six years and had found no pattern that would suggest it was making defective tires. The company, which makes about 39 million tires a year, declined to release that data but said it would submit it to Congress or federal safety regulators if asked.</p>
        <p>The Ford and Firestone case has cast a harsh light on the safety agency's ability to identify troublesome patterns and spot problems in a timely fashion. Yesterday, Ms. Bailey said the emergence of a significant number of lawsuits involving fatalities with Cooper tires -- a fact unknown to the agency until recently -- underscores why Congress should give the agency the power to compel tire makers to send the agency information about safety-related lawsuits.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, the public often does not know to contact N.H.T.S.A, but we're going to correct that,'' Ms. Bailey said. ''This is the kind of information that could be essential to us.''</p>
        <p>In the current climate of concern, regulators and consumer advocates are pressing tire makers to release internal data on tread separations and serious accidents, particularly those involving light trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles. A number of studies have concluded those vehicles are more prone than smaller passenger cars to roll over after a tread separation occurs at highway speed. Just this week, a Senate committee passed a bill to establish criminal penalties for companies that fail to notify the government about safety defects that result in death or serious injury.</p>
        <p>While the Firestone case is the only one in which regulators say they have discerned a pattern of dangerous defects, nearly every major tire maker is facing lawsuits over crashes linked to tread separations. Not counting the Bridgestone/Firestone cases, lawsuits in the United States claim that at least 100 deaths and serious injuries have resulted from such tire failures, according to court records. A large majority of the cases, several of which have been settled out of court, involve minivans, sport utility vehicles and light trucks of nearly every make.</p>
        <p>But, given the weakness of the system for data collection and analysis, there is considerable debate over when a collection of cases coalesces into a safety problem.</p>
        <p>Though some consumer advocates say that premature tread separations should almost never occur under normal conditions and that tire makers could easily solve the problem by adding nylon caps over the steel belts, tire makers say that tires often do fail because of unusual stresses, punctures and underinflation.</p>
        <p>''We make 200 million tires a year and we're very comfortable with what our data suggests about the safety of the product,'' said Chuck Sinclair, a spokesman at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio.</p>
        <p>Other tire makers say similar things:, that tires regularly fail, that poor maintenance or road hazards often lead to failures and that they see no evidence of a troubling pattern.</p>
        <p>Cooper officials say the company has made more than 250 million tires since 1994 and few complaints have been filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That agency said that it received just 26 complaints against Cooper in the last decade, although 10 of those were filed in the last year.</p>
        <p>''We have made a careful and thorough analysis and have found no correlation between our lawsuit cases and any type of vehicle such as S.U.V., minivans or light trucks,'' the company said yesterday in a written statement. ''We have no reason to recall any tire.''</p>
        <p>Several lawsuits, however, assert that poor quality control at the company's plants, particularly the one in Tupelo, Miss., has resulted in defective tires that sometimes fall apart on larger vehicles.</p>
        <p>According to a group of lawyers who are independently pressing claims against Cooper, 11 deaths and at least 4 serious injuries were caused by poor manufacturing processes at the Tupelo plant.</p>
        <p>''I have not seen a Cooper design defect case like the current Firestone situation,'' said C. Tab Turner, a lawyer who recently won a $3.4 million judgment against Cooper in Mississippi. ''Cooper is more of a story about poor manufacturing practices, which results in sporadic bad tires on various lines of tires. Their process controls are horrendous.''</p>
