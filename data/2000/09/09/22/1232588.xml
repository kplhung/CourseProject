        <p>Bulgaria's weight-lifting team said today that it may pull out of the Sydney Olympics after traces of banned substances were found in doping tests on two more of its medalists.</p>
        <p>Izabela Dragneva, the winner of the women's 106-pound gold medal, and Sevdalin Minchev Angelov, the men's 137-pound bronze medalist, had traces of diuretics in their samples, Beltcho Ivanov, of the Bulgarian National Olympic Committee, said. He said another sample would be tested later today. If it tested positive, the team would consider pulling out, he said.</p>
