        <p>Directed by Stephen Kinsella  Not rated; 98 minutes</p>
        <p>Sunshine and shadow color ''Double Parked,'' a modest but engaging mixture of comedy and drama that derives most of its energy from the performance of Callie Thorne.</p>
        <p>In this film, produced and directed by Stephen Kinsella, who wrote the screenplay with Paul Solberg, Ms. Thorne plays Rita Ronaldi, a single mother struggling to raise her sickly son, Matt (Rufus Read), who is befriended by a juvenile delinquent.</p>
        <p>At first the delinquent, Bret (Noah Fleiss), is using Matt only to help him through yet another year in the sixth grade. What's worse is that Bret is Matt's illegitimate half-brother, fathered by the drunken, abusive brute who used to be Rita's husband, a man Matt has been told is long dead.</p>
        <p>So while Matt's schoolwork suffers, he drifts into petty crime under the tutelage of Bret, whose demanding, punk girlfriend dispenses drugs and sexual favors in return for some of Bret's loot. Bret's father, ever ready to administer a good beating, also shares in the proceeds.</p>
        <p>Rita, having lost her job as a waitress, but not her spirit, when she draped her boss in spaghetti after he groped her, listens to self-help tapes and endures blunt rejections as she seeks work. But eventually her sheer persistence wins her an appointment as a Jersey City meter maid.</p>
        <p>To make life even better, she  captures the eye of the handsome Karl Severson (William Sage), who just happens to be Matt's concerned teacher. But Matt has defied her instructions to stay away from Bret. Big trouble and big revelations are just around the corner.</p>
        <p>But as evidenced by the performances of Ms. Thorne, of Eileen Galindro as her over-the-top meter maid rival, Dolores Gonzalez, and of Anthony De Sando as Dolores's cousin Angel Gonzalez, who fancies himself God's gift to Rita, in the end Mr. Kinsella's heart is unsurprisingly on the side of comedy and sunshine.</p>
