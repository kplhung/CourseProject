        <p>The New York Philharmonic announced yesterday that Kurt Masur is withdrawing from two weeks of subscription concerts he was to have conducted in November and from a special concert being added in October. Mr. Masur has to undergo an unspecified minor surgical procedure, and will need time to recover.</p>
        <p>The subscription concerts are on Nov. 2, 3, 4 and 7, with the pianist Emanuel Ax as soloist, and Nov. 9, 10 and 14, with two members of the orchestra -- Glenn Dicterow, the concertmaster, and Carter Brey, the principal cellist -- as soloists. Mr. Masur also planned to conduct a concert in memory of Leonard Bernstein, to be added to the Philharmonic schedule on Oct. 31.</p>

        <p>The New York Philharmonic announced yesterday that Kurt Masur is withdrawing from two weeks of subscription concerts he was to have conducted in November and from a special concert being added in October. Mr. Masur has to undergo an unspecified minor surgical procedure, and will need time to recover.</p>
        <p>The subscription concerts are on Nov. 2, 3, 4 and 7, with the pianist Emanuel Ax as soloist, and Nov. 9, 10 and 14, with two members of the orchestra -- Glenn Dicterow, the concertmaster, and Carter Brey, the principal cellist -- as soloists. Mr. Masur also planned to conduct a concert in memory of Leonard Bernstein, to be added to the Philharmonic schedule on Oct. 31.</p>
        <p>Bernstein died on Oct. 14, 1990, and a series in his memory on Oct. 12, 13, 14 and 17, conducted by Leonard Slatkin and including Bernstein's ''Jeremiah'' Symphony, is to go ahead as scheduled. In addition, the orchestra is releasing a 10-CD set of previously unpublished Bernstein recordings from its archives next month.</p>
        <p>With the orchestra bogged down in a search for a successor to Mr. Masur as music director when he leaves in 2002, a fascinating sidelight on the cancellation comes with the selection of replacement conductors. Mariss Jansons is to conduct the Bernstein program. Mikko Franck takes over the first week of subscription concerts, in his Philharmonic debut, and Christoph Eschenbach the second.</p>
        <p>While the Philharmonic courted Riccardo Muti as music director during the summer, Mr. Jansons and Mr. Eschenbach were also said by people within the organization to be on the short list of candidates. Mr. Muti rejected the orchestra's overtures in July.</p>
        <p>As to the others, Zarin Mehta, who took over as executive director of the orchestra this month, said recently that he preferred the term ''wish list'' and that ''it has names that could not possibly be involved with the Philharmonic for a variety of reasons.'' Indeed, the smart money in the business now puts Mr. Eschenbach -- the chief conductor of the NDR Symphony in Hamburg -- in Philadelphia, as the prime candidate to succeed Wolfgang Sawallisch as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra in 2002.</p>
        <p>In any case, orchestras hiring music directors usually consider only candidates who have experience with the players, preferably recent experience. Mr. Jansons, the music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, last appeared with the Philharmonic in 1996, Mr. Eschenbach in 1998. Mr. Mehta and Paul B. Guenther, the chairman of the Philharmonic have said that they hope to name Mr. Masur's successor by the end of the year.</p>
