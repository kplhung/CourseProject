        <p>An illuminating moment in the life of Kevin Gover occurred one day recently on an airplane over the Midwest.</p>
        <p>''Excuse me,'' said the little boy sitting next to him. ''Are you a Native American?''</p>
        <p>''Why, yes I am,'' replied Mr. Gover, an assistant secretary of the Interior Department in charge of the agency's Bureau of Indian Affairs and a member of the Pawnee tribe.</p>
        <p>''Me too!'' the little boy said, proudly revealing his Cherokee-Blackfoot heritage.</p>
        <p>And then, Mr. Gover recalled, the boy busied himself drawing a pretty good likeness of the Cleveland Indians' logo, an image Mr. Gover detests as much as he does the name of the professional football team in the nation's capital, the Redskins.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gover (rhymes with clover) talked about the encounter during a wide-ranging interview in his office on the fourth floor of the Interior Department building, a vast structure that houses part of a huge bureaucracy that once regarded American Indians as a problem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gover refused to dismiss the boy's preoccupation with the smiling, big-toothed baseball caricature as harmless. No, he said, it could damage the child's self-image, whether he knows it or not. Besides, he added, ''It infects, and thereby affects people's attitudes toward Indians.''</p>
        <p>The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which is now largely run by Indians for Indians, is seldom counted among the high-profile agencies of the government. But Mr. Gover made news recently when he used a celebration of the bureau's 175th anniversary to apologize for the past.</p>
        <p>''This agency set out to destroy all things Indian,'' he said at the Sept. 8 celebration. ''The legacy of these misdeeds haunts us. . . . Our hearts break.'' He apologized on behalf of the bureau for the forced relocation of Indians it once ran as part of the old War Department and for decades of broken treaties and promises.</p>
        <p>The apology produced a flurry of letters and e-mail messages, most friendly but a few laced with vitriol that could politely be called reflections of white pride.</p>
        <p>With his days in government winding down after three years in charge of Indian affairs, Mr. Gover looks forward to using his ''one marketable skill,'' as he put it. He is a lawyer and will practice in Washington, devoting much of his time to issues related to Indians.</p>
        <p>Only a few decades ago, he said, all the Indians who were lawyers could have sat around a big conference table with plenty of room for coffee cups and note pads. Now, he said, more than 1,000 Indians practice law.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gover, 45, is one of three children born to working-class parents in Lawton, Okla. His mother and father were civilian employees at Fort Sill (where Geronimo was once held captive), and Mr. Gover sensed almost as soon as he could walk that he was not like other Americans.</p>
        <p>''There were the John Wayne movies,'' he said. ''You know, a white man fires a shot and six Indians fall off their horses. . . .''</p>
        <p>When Kevin Gover was 15, a social worker who knew his father changed his life. With federal scholarship aid, he went to a prep school in New Hampshire, then to Princeton University, where he did not exactly thrive. He did not belong to one of the university's elite eating clubs, which dominate student social life and help define its hierarchy. ''I'm past the point of hating the eating clubs,'' Mr. Gover said.</p>
        <p>Well, perhaps not entirely. ''I belonged to the Jewish eating club,'' he said. ''They were nonselective.''</p>
        <p>He befriended some black students, honed his credentials as ''an angry young man,'' joined protests to persuade Princeton to divest itself of investments in South Africa during the apartheid era and earned a degree in public and international affairs. Later, he graduated from the University of New Mexico Law School, served as a clerk for a federal judge and practiced law in Washington and Albuquerque. He is married with two children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gover said he was pleased with the growing political power of Indians and, of course, with their economic gains. ''There are more and more people like me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Just down the hall from his office, near tribal flags from across the country, are two murals from the Depression era. One shows a dashing cavalry officer talking man-to-man to a group of Indians. Another shows a white man patiently showing Indians how to plant vegetables.</p>
        <p>''At first, I wanted to have them painted over,'' he said half-jokingly. He decided to let them stay, as a reminder.</p>
