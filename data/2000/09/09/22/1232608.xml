        <p>Floyd Norris comment on whether Democratic Presidential candidate Al Gore can survive rising oil prices and falling stock prices; says history has shown in most cases that if Dow Jones industrial average rises from end of July through end of October--three months when investors are most attuned to political season--the incumbent party will win the election; adds if the Dow falls the incumbents will be thrown out; holds Republicans could have picked better candidates to fight over oil; both George W Bush and Dick Cheney are former oil company executives who once praised rising oil prices; says Gore will bash sky-high profit margins that oil refiners now enjoy; contends Bush will denounce Clinton administration as not having effective energy policy, and that could have effect; holds the Dow and the election may turn on whether oil prices stay high for next six weeks; graph (M)</p>

        <p>AS election forecasters go, the Dow Jones industrial average has a better record than most. And its latest swan dive may be bad news for Al Gore.</p>
        <p>This will be the 26th presidential election since Charles H. Dow put his industrial average together in 1897. So far, its record as an election prognosticator is 22-3 -- not perfect, but at least as good as the average pollster.</p>
        <p>The indicator says that if the Dow rises from the end of July through the end of October -- the three months when investors are most attuned to the political season -- the incumbent party will win the election. If the Dow falls, however, the incumbents will be thrown out. Perhaps a rising stock market reflects contented voters.</p>
        <p>It has been 32 years since the Dow last blew an election call. In 1968, the Dow rose 7.9 percent during the three key months, but that was not enough to put Hubert H. Humphrey -- the last Democrat to run for president while serving as vice president -- over the top. Mr. Humphrey faced a few problems that Al Gore does not, notably a party that was badly split by the Vietnam War and by the third-party candidacy of George C. Wallace.</p>
        <p>The other failures came in two elections when the outcome was not seriously in doubt. The Dow managed a rise in the three months before the 1932 election, but there was no way that was going to restore Herbert Hoover's reputation as an economic manager. And in 1956, a slip in the Dow was no threat to Dwight D. Eisenhower's re-election.</p>
        <p>In recent elections, the record has been perfect. The Dow fell in 1976, 1980 and 1992, all years that the incumbent president lost. The incumbent party prevailed in 1972, 1984, 1988 and 1996, when the Dow rose.</p>
        <p>The Dow indicator is broadly consistent with a number of other historical trends. It is highly unusual for an incumbent party to be thrown out unless there is substantial discontent about the economy.</p>
        <p>This year, most pundits treated Mr. Gore as a long shot through much of the summer, notwithstanding the strong economy. They reversed course as he pulled ahead in the polls after the Democratic Convention in August. As it happened, the Dow started an impressive rise before the convention, gaining 7.6 percent, or almost 800 points, from July 27 through Sept. 6. With August up nicely, it looked as if the Dow was backing Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>But since then the Dow has slid, dropping in 9 of 11 sessions, including 6 in a row before it rebounded yesterday. Not since 1995 had the Dow gone down in 6 consecutive sessions. Since Sept. 6, the Dow is down 4.8 percent, wiping out most of the August gains.</p>
        <p>What went wrong? To be crude about it, oil. The comfortable Wall Street assumption that the Federal Reserve had engineered a soft landing, in which growth would slow enough to stem inflation but not enough to do real damage, is being challenged by the continued rise in oil prices. Recessions followed previous oil shocks.</p>
        <p>The Republicans, to be sure, could have picked better candidates to fight over oil. Both George W. Bush and Dick Cheney are former oil company executives who once praised rising oil prices. Mr. Gore will bash the sky-high profit margins that oil refiners now enjoy.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Bush will denounce the Clinton administration as not having an effective energy policy, and that could have an effect. Like it or not, the Dow -- and the election -- may turn on whether oil prices stay high for the next six weeks.</p>
