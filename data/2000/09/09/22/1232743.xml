        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Although David A. Shaywitz (Op-Ed, Sept. 19) emphasizes his uncle's doctor's dismissal of the possibility of additional months of life of a good quality, what is even more distressing is that the patient's wife sensed that the attending doctor was irritated when she called him at 4 a.m. to report a high fever.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Although David A. Shaywitz (Op-Ed, Sept. 19) emphasizes his uncle's doctor's dismissal of the possibility of additional months of life of a good quality, what is even more distressing is that the patient's wife sensed that the attending doctor was irritated when she called him at 4 a.m. to report a high fever.</p>
        <p>Being awakened at such an hour is part of being a doctor, and such irritation warrants censure by the chief of his department. Such supervision, rarely exercised these days, might have a chastening effect on many staff doctors who forget their professional oaths and responsibilities.</p>
        <p>MORTON D. BOGDONOFF, M.D.  New York, Sept. 19, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is emeritus professor of medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University.</p>
