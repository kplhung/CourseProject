        <p>Just in case voters needed clarification of Gov. George W. Bush's education proposals, here was Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado on Tuesday, playing host to reporters from local and national news organizations on a telephone conference call.</p>
        <p>Around the same time, Gov. Jane Dee Hull of Arizona was standing on the Capitol steps in Phoenix, announcing the formation of the Arizona Bush-Cheney Farm and Ranch Team, a group to build support among agricultural interests.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the week, Gov. John Engler of Michigan and Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio each held a news conference to promote what Mr. Bush calls his blueprint for middle-class voters.</p>
        <p>Take a good look out there on the Republican presidential campaign trail: Mr. Bush's gubernatorial brethren seem to be everywhere. One actually is a brother, Jeb Bush of Florida. But steadily, the campaign is calling on many of the 28 other Republican governors to promote the Texas governor, who has fallen behind in recent national polls. At least one governor, Mr. Engler, has actually complained to the campaign that the governors have not been asked to do more.</p>
        <p>''This is a very close campaign,'' Mr. Owens said during the telephone call, explaining why he had become active in the Bush campaign. ''It will be decided by the electoral votes in one, two, three, maybe four states. So it is critical for governors like myself to be very involved.''</p>
        <p>Bush campaign officials say efforts by the governors provide a major asset in helping to offset the widespread political connections Al Gore has built over nearly eight years as vice president, including the Democratic governors who are working for him, like Parris N. Glendening of Maryland and Gray Davis of California.</p>
        <p>For one thing, there are more Republican governors -- 30, compared with 18 Democrats and 2 independents. And Republicans lead 8 of the 10 most populous states, including Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which are considered crucial battleground states.</p>
        <p>In addition to the numerical advantage, several Republican governors said their shared ideologies and their parallel experience made them ideal surrogates, enabling them to spread his gospel more widely. It is a strategy they say could prove especially helpful now that more voters are focusing on the election and appear eager to learn the nuances of difference in policy positions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Owens, who has led efforts to improve the educational system in Colorado, spent 30 minutes on the telephone, drawing sharp distinctions between Mr. Bush's ideas for education and those offered by Mr. Gore, whom Mr. Owens criticized as a pawn of teachers' unions.</p>
        <p>Other governors have spoken for Mr. Bush on issues they are especially familiar with, like Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, on the welfare system; James S. Gilmore III of Virginia, on criminal justice; and  Marc Racicot of Montana, on the management of public lands.</p>
        <p>As the latest indication that governors are influencing campaign strategy, Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, has been meeting with party officials in Midwestern states to discuss using localized commercials, a tactic some of the governors have been urging Mr. Bush to adopt.</p>
        <p>In addition, the governors are proving to be assets in statewide organization and fund-raising. Even Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, whose work has been minimal because of Utah's overwhelming support for Republicans and his own re-election efforts, has helped raise $500,000 for the Bush ticket.</p>
        <p>Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts, a solid Democratic state, said he has spent considerable time organizing Republican support in Maine and New Hampshire, where the campaign is more competitive.</p>
        <p>''Governors are our secret weapon,'' said Terry Holt, a spokesman for Victory 2000, the branch of the Republican National Committee that coordinates activities with the Bush campaign. ''They are often the most aggressive grass-roots workers in their state, so they help us organizationally, and they understand the issues.''</p>
        <p>The governors have grown so eager to help that, one Bush aide said,  ''there are not enough national television shows'' to accommodate them, and some are not known well enough nationally to be persuasive outside of their states.</p>
        <p>''But all of them are being used,'' the aide said.</p>
        <p>The governors' willingness to play a role in Mr. Bush's campaign began long before he declared himself a candidate, several governors said. Mr. Racicot said the first conversations were at a meeting of the National Governors Association in Washington in February of 1999, a time when other Republicans were contemplating a presidential run.</p>
        <p>''I remember talking about it with Engler and Cellucci, specifically about how many people at the N.G.A. meeting would be supportive of Governor Bush running for president,'' Mr. Racicot said. ''We decided that maybe we should ask around, and before we knew it, we had 12 to 15 of the Republican governors, which I thought was very significant. This was still a full year before the primaries, but we had a critical mass.''</p>
        <p>By the end of the meeting, Mr. Racicot said, about two-thirds of the Republican governors had agreed to support Mr. Bush, giving him a huge organizational advantage over other potential candidates.</p>
        <p>And, as Mr. Cellucci said, ''some of them were other governors.''</p>
        <p>Those talks led to agreement among the governors that they would do whatever a Bush campaign asked. And it has asked a lot, leaning especially hard on governors with higher national profiles, like Mr. Engler, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Racicot, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, George E. Pataki of New York and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>Like other Republican governors, Mr. Owens volunteered to serve as state chairman for the Bush campaign. He said he was planning to do more for Mr. Bush, including traveling with other governors through Western states to drum up support.</p>
        <p>''You're going to see all the Republican governors very active,'' Mr. Owens said. ''Governors are, perhaps, more believable because of who we are, and as his colleagues, we can bring home his message.''</p>
