        <p>Time Warner Telecom said yesterday that it had received bankruptcy court approval to buy a rival, GST Telecommunications, for $690 million. The acquisition of GST, which is based in Vancouver, Wash., will allow Time Warner Telecom to expand its presence in the western United States, effectively doubling to 44 the number of markets where it provides business communications services. Time Warner Telecom said it had also received commitments from its banks for $1.2 billion of additional financing to buy GST, which operates a national Internet system that includes 4,200 miles of fiber optic lines.</p>
