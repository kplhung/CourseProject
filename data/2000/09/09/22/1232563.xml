        <p>Black and White</p>
        <p>''I want to be black, get into the hip-hop thing,'' Charlie (Bijou Phillips) tells a documentary maker (Brooke Shields, left) in James Toback's film about well-off white teenagers longing to crack the black world in New York City. Their eagerness perplexes Rich Bower (Power of the Wu-Tang Clan), a man of the streets and an aspiring record producer who attracts white youth as moths to the flame. The movies haven't treated explicit worship of black culture in some time. ''Mr. Toback hits it with a chain saw, and the chunks go flying,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $105.77; DVD, $24.95. 100 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Sept. 26.</p>

        <p>Black and White</p>
        <p>''I want to be black, get into the hip-hop thing,'' Charlie (Bijou Phillips) tells a documentary maker (Brooke Shields, left) in James Toback's film about well-off white teenagers longing to crack the black world in New York City. Their eagerness perplexes Rich Bower (Power of the Wu-Tang Clan), a man of the streets and an aspiring record producer who attracts white youth as moths to the flame. The movies haven't treated explicit worship of black culture in some time. ''Mr. Toback hits it with a chain saw, and the chunks go flying,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $105.77; DVD, $24.95. 100 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Sept. 26.</p>
        <p>Where the Heart Is</p>
        <p>Abandoned in an Oklahoma Wal-Mart parking lot by her boyfriend, the destitute unwed mother-to-be Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman) starts living in the store, borrowing whatever consumer items she needs. Luckily an earth mother named Sister Husband (Stockard Channing) lends her a hand, a young librarian (James Frain) helps with the birth and Wal-Mart contributes some money and a job as a photographer. Then there is Novalee's friend Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd), steadfast mother of five by various liaisons, to help stir fast-erupting crises into an ''astonishingly shameless melodrama'' (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2000. Fox. $107.37; DVD, $34.98. 120 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Sept. 26.</p>
        <p>Waking the Dead</p>
        <p>Keith Gordon's painfully earnest screen adaptation of Scott Spencer's novel grasps at a fusion of historicism and heartbreak we normally expect to find in Hollywood epics. In the 1970's Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup), a working-class golden boy and congressional candidate, lost his true love, Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), who was killed in a car bombing. But well into the next decade Fielding is still obsessed with her to the point of seeing her apparition on the street. That could get scary, but the movie loses any chance of establishing a mood by leaping back and forth between the 70's and early 80's, ''forever stumbling over itself and breaking its own spell'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>2000. USA. $56.49; DVD, $24.95. 105 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Sept. 26.</p>
        <p>The Cup</p>
        <p>World Cup soccer fever sweeps young monks in training at a Buddhist monastery in India. Problem is, there is no television set to watch the matches, which prompts the 14-year-old Orgyen (Jamyang Lodro) to convince the elders to let him swing a deal to rent a set for a key game. While the penetration of Western consumer culture into remote areas is viewed simplistically by most accounts, Khyentse Norbu's film ''finds ironies and nuances in the encounter between modernity and tradition that media critics rarely notice'' (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>2000. New Line . $109.99. 94 minutes. Bhutanese with English subtitles. G. Release date: Sept. 26.</p>
        <p>Straight to Video</p>
        <p>Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.</p>
        <p>A SUMMER'S TALE. In the third of Eric Rohmer's so-called four-seasons cycle, a young man travels to the coast of Brittany in hopes of pursuing one young woman, only to encounter two others of different and perhaps surpassing charms who might be interested but only under certain conditions. 1996. Winstar. $89.98; DVD, $29.98. 113 minutes. French with English subtitles. No rating.</p>
        <p>A SCENE AT THE SEA and KIDS RETURN. In the wake of Takeshi Kitano's ''Boiling Point'' and ''Violent Cop,'' both released on video earlier this year, come two gentler, more introspective films by this Japanese director, author and television personality. In ''A Scene at the Sea'' (1991, 101 minutes) a deaf garbage collector, encouraged by his deaf girlfriend, aspires to become a surfboard champion. The loosely autobiographical ''Kids Return'' (1996, 107 minutes) follows two delinquent teenagers who cut up at school and then drop out to take up, respectively, boxing and the gangster life. Kimstim. $59.95 each. Japanese with English subtitles. No rating.</p>
        <p>MUDDY WATERS: GOT MY MOJO WORKING. The father of the Chicago blues sound picks up his career in 1968 and moves on to rock 'n' roll with versions of ''Country Boy,'' ''Long Distance Call,'' ''Honey Bee'' and nine other numbers that also feature the pianists Otis Span and Pinetop Perkins and other notable sidemen. 2000. Shanachie. $19.95; DVD, $24.95. 55 minutes.</p>
