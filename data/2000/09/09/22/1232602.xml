        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>With some skepticism, I commend President Clinton for finally pledging to confront the serious problems facing our national forests here in the West with a fire management plan that professional foresters have been advocating for some time (front page, Sept. 19).</p>
        <p>The threat of catastrophic and environmentally devastating forest fires has been the primary concern of Western foresters -- including many Forest Service personnel -- for about a decade, but not a thing was done about it.</p>
        <p>It is a shame that it takes 6.6 million acres of destroyed forests and a political controversy before politicians in Washington actually take action to address real problems instead of endlessly debating political ones. It really makes you wonder about the wisdom of the American people's having entrusted our 187 million acres of national forests to their care.</p>
        <p>ANNE HAYES  Sacramento, Sept. 19, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation.</p>
