        <p>The case of Jonathan Lebed, labeled a teenage stock swindler, illustrates the two most salient facts about stock market fraud today, law enforcement officials and securities lawyers say.</p>
        <p>Manipulating the market is easier than ever, thanks to the Internet. But tracing and catching the perpetrators is also easier than ever, thanks to the Internet.</p>
        <p>Driving the price of a stock up by putting out false information, then selling at an inflated price -- a classic manipulation known as a ''pump and dump'' -- used to be done by corporate executives who put out false press releases, or brokerage firms that hired hundreds of brokers to push stocks over the telephone.</p>
        <p>But today, a pump and dump can be done by anyone ''with a home computer and a telephone line that connects to the Internet,'' said Stephen M. Cutler, deputy director for enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington.</p>
        <p>Because the fraud involves sending e-mail messages that must have been seen by many people and are easily traced, Mr. Cutler said, ''you have footprints, evidence right there in front of you, so the only question is tying it'' to the right person.</p>
        <p>In today's overheated investing environment, pumping up a stock price can be child's play, as authorities say the 15-year-old Jonathan Lebed demonstrated. According to the commission's case, which he settled, he bought big blocks of shares of companies in which trading was very light. Then he sent out hundreds of messages to Internet bulletin boards, claiming that the stocks he owned were about to soar.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. considers these messages a fraud because he knew he had no facts to back up his claim that the stocks would rise, and because he used many names, faking a groundswell of interest.</p>
        <p>Excited traders piled into these stocks, at higher and higher prices; Jonathan then sold, reaping profits of $11,000 to $74,000, according to the S.E.C. (The accounts were in his father's name, but Jonathan made the trading decisions.)</p>
        <p>And though his tender age makes him unusual, Jonathan has had plenty of company in the stock-promoting business. Earlier this month, the S.E.C. filed a similar case against Gursel Mandaci, a 25-year-old part-time student at Baruch College who drives for a car service.</p>
        <p>The commission contends that Mr. Mandaci made more than $23,000 manipulating six low-priced and obscure stocks over the Internet during February and March; he has not replied to the charges and did not respond to a telephone message left yesterday at his home in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>In fact, the S.E.C. has brought 68 Internet-related fraud cases so far this year, up from 55 in all of 1999 and just 6 in 1995. The commission has 50 people devoted exclusively to fighting Internet fraud, up from just 2 a couple of years ago.</p>
        <p>As far as Internet frauds go, ''the numbers are way up, and they don't seem to be abating,'' said Joel Cohen, a former federal prosecutor who is now in private practice at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig in New York. And while cases like Jonathan's may not seem serious, an adult who did the same thing would probably face criminal prosecution, he said, noting that investors who bought stock at inflated prices based on false messages lost real money in such schemes.</p>
        <p>Wary Internet investors, in fact, may be prosecutors' and regulators' secret weapon. They are quick to scent an attempted manipulation, and quick to report their suspicions to the S.E.C., which says it gets about 300 e-mail complaints a day.</p>
        <p>Certainly, traders were suspicious about Jonathan's activities. In January, as he was sending hundreds of what officials say were false and misleading messages about a company called Man Sang Holdings, someone wrote a warning on the Raging Bull bulletin board: ''Careful folks, this sounds like classic pump and dump!''</p>
