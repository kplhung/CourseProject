        <p>Until I was 19 years old and, by then, living in New York (which once again celebrates itself as book country this weekend), I had never read a book of serious literature written in the 20th century and I had never read a book of serious literature written by someone who was not English and by that I do not mean someone from Britain. I mean literature written by someone from that place known as England. This wasn't the fault of anyone in particular. No one made a special effort to keep me from Virginia Woolf or E. M. Forster. It is just that I spent the first 16 years of my life on an island in the Caribbean Sea that was a British colony. To us the British Empire was the entire alphabet and in it we were not more than the dot over the common letter i.</p>
        <p>I grew up in this place in the 1950's.  The British Empire had come to a well-deserved halt in the late 1940's but nobody had bothered to tell us. And so we celebrated Queen Victoria's birthday during whose reign the empire was at its apogee; and we kept up with the world as shown to us by Thomas Hardy and  Charles Dickens and Jane Austen and John Keats and William Shakespeare, not for their sole literary value, not because the books by these authors might be the best books in all the world worth reading, but because it was the world of the people who held such intimate dominion over us, a world in which trouble and pain were the ideals of trouble and pain, such different trouble and pain from our own, which were messy and everlasting, never going away like the ones in the books would do when we closed the covers.</p>

        <p>Until I was 19 years old and, by then, living in New York (which once again celebrates itself as book country this weekend), I had never read a book of serious literature written in the 20th century and I had never read a book of serious literature written by someone who was not English and by that I do not mean someone from Britain. I mean literature written by someone from that place known as England. This wasn't the fault of anyone in particular. No one made a special effort to keep me from Virginia Woolf or E. M. Forster. It is just that I spent the first 16 years of my life on an island in the Caribbean Sea that was a British colony. To us the British Empire was the entire alphabet and in it we were not more than the dot over the common letter i.</p>
        <p>I grew up in this place in the 1950's.  The British Empire had come to a well-deserved halt in the late 1940's but nobody had bothered to tell us. And so we celebrated Queen Victoria's birthday during whose reign the empire was at its apogee; and we kept up with the world as shown to us by Thomas Hardy and  Charles Dickens and Jane Austen and John Keats and William Shakespeare, not for their sole literary value, not because the books by these authors might be the best books in all the world worth reading, but because it was the world of the people who held such intimate dominion over us, a world in which trouble and pain were the ideals of trouble and pain, such different trouble and pain from our own, which were messy and everlasting, never going away like the ones in the books would do when we closed the covers.</p>
        <p>And so at 19, if I had been asked why I had not ever read the thing called serious literature written in the 20th century, I would have had to say that no one wrote books with that quality anymore; that kind of serious literature had been a fashion and, after Dickens, there was nothing; that kind of thing was no longer done.</p>
        <p>But then at 19 I was living as a servant  with a family in New York City and the woman at the head of the household was a feminist and because of that she was not unsympathetic to my predicament in the world -- I was female and poor. This woman was female but most of all she was privileged and her privileges included reading real literature and this literature led her to believe that her existence was not enchanted. It was this woman who gave me as a present some  books by Woolf, and lent me ''The Second Sex'' by Simone de Beauvoir and ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking'' by Julia Child, Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck.</p>
        <p>It must have been the powerful anger I then had (and have now and hope to have to the end of a very long life) as someone female and poor -- but above all female -- that led my employer to give me ''The Second Sex,'' but when I read it I did not feel grateful that someone (Beauvoir or the female head of the household in which I was a servant) had made valid or confirmed the things I knew already about being female. I only became even more angry that people I had thought to be in a position superior to mine could only tell me about the misery I already knew; they could not tell me how to alleviate it.</p>
        <p>I read ''The Second Sex,'' putting it aside to walk some small children through Central Park so they could get some fresh air, putting it aside so I could wash their clothes and cook their dinner. When I finished reading  the book I put it away and never looked at it again, not up to now. I recommend it to women, especially if they are at the age I was when I first read it, but I will never read it again.</p>
        <p>Not so ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking.'' The book itself was big and thick, oversize for a book. I had never seen a book full of recipes before. My mother was a very good cook of West Indian food and even English food. Everybody loved her cooking and found it delicious and told her so; but all the food she cooked she seemed to know how to make into something worth eating just by looking at it. I never saw her consult a book. I cannot now even remember what made me so in love with a mere cookbook then, for no dish in it was familiar. There is a recipe in it for mayonnaise and when I first saw this, a recipe for mayonnaise, I was so surprised. To me then, mayonnaise was something that could only come in a bottle from England.</p>
        <p>On very, very special occasions, we would have a dish, a salad of canned peas, canned sliced carrots and canned sliced beets, and how pleased we were with ourselves to be having things from a tin instead of the very same things just growing outside our house. My mother was very good at growing everything, flowers for ornaments or vegetables for feeding our family, but we were not the first or the last to have become convinced that the sweat of our brow was repulsive.</p>
        <p>It was many years after I first came to know ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking'' that I made mayonnaise. The first thing I made from this book was Bavarois a l'Orange -- its subtitle was Orange Bavarian Cream -- a cold dessert. It was such a triumph, and everyone told me so and they were not being kind, for even I could tell that it was very good.</p>
        <p>Not so very long after that I was working at a magazine that was at the corner of 12th Street and Fifth Avenue and next door to my job was a bookstore but it carried only old books. This job was such a good example of how ill suited I am to be under anyone's thumb. The head of my department was a very nice man before lunch; I was a very competent employee before lunch. At lunchtime he went to a restaurant next door to the office and this restaurant had an enormous bar and I went home to my apartment, which was only two blocks from where I worked and I smoked marijuana. When he came back from lunch he was an angry person; when I came back from lunch I was stupendously incompetent.</p>
        <p>This angry person, the man in charge of my department, was not entirely unfamiliar to me, for by then I had read much American literature. In the old bookstore next door I had found the complete works (complete up to then) of Ernest Hemingway, the complete works (complete up to then) of Scott Fitzgerald, the complete works (complete up to then) of John O'Hara. If only life could be so seamless, I said to myself. But life is so seamless, if only I would agree to accept its seamlessness, is another thing I said to myself.</p>
        <p>When I was 25 years old I began to write for a magazine whose address was 25 West 43rd Street. I lived then at 449 West 22nd Street and sometimes I would walk the mile or so to my office and sometimes I would take the subway. New York then seems so innocent to me now. But how can that be? For I can remember one very hot day in a crowded train, having a very nice chat with a man standing next to me, and I happened to look down and saw that he was sexually aroused and was rubbing himself up against me. When in fear and shame I looked at him, he laughed in my face and wormed his way into another car.</p>
        <p>The writer George Trow introduced me to the editor of the magazine that was at 25 West 43rd Street, and it was George Trow who introduced me to Ian (Sandy) Frazier. George thought that Sandy, who had graduated from Harvard University, and I, who had spent two seconds at a strange college in New Hampshire, were ill read. George was six years older than I and eight years older than Sandy and on top of that we thought he was a great writer (then and now) and would read everything he wrote with awe and wonderment at how he had done it, how did he write the thing we had just read.</p>
        <p>When he implied that we were almost illiterate because of the things we had not read, we were not insulted, we were quite pleased. He made Sandy read all seven volumes of ''Remembrance of Things Past''; it took Sandy two years to do this. He bought for me a copy of Fowler's Guide to Modern English Usage and he told me that I should read it from beginning to end. I stopped at the end of ''U.''</p>
        <p>While reading all of Proust, Sandy was also reading and committing to memory ''Ninety-Two in the Shade,'' the novel by Thomas McGuane. While reading Fowler's guide I was also reading a biography of Lytton Strachey. But Sandy had decided to make me his audience for the novel he had memorized, and when I showed only a small interest in Thomas McGuane because I was so absorbed by the life of Strachey, he decided to read about Strachey also. Sandy was then and still is now an honorable and just version of that thing no one wants to be anymore: an American white man; and so after he read about Strachey and his friends, Sandy wrote a funny piece called ''The Bloomsbury Group Live at the Apollo.''</p>
        <p>When I was 3 1/2 years old my mother taught me to read, for she was a compulsive reader and I was always interrupting her when she was concentrating on her reading and she thought that if I knew how to read, I would be so absorbed by reading, the way she was, that I would leave her alone. That became true. I became so absorbed by reading that I did leave my mother alone to do her own reading, but once I knew how to read I loved it so much that I read everything in front of me. I read the Bible and for my seventh birthday my mother gave me a copy of the Concise Oxford English Dictionary. Since I had nothing else but the Bible to read, I also read the dictionary.  How I loved it. But somehow, somewhere, I lost it, and as if to make up for that loss, I am forever buying a dictionary and comparing definitions and meanings.</p>
        <p>That particular world of my particular childhood placed me in the world of books. In that particular world of my particular childhood I was poor and female and that latter vulnerability made my family not think twice about sending me out into the world where I would work and my earnings would support them. In New York I found books and I made a living writing them. This was not something anybody had counted on.</p>
