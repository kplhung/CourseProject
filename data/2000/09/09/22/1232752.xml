        <p>Holland Cotter reviews Chinese and Japanese art at Kaikodo gallery (S)</p>

        <p>Through Oct. 21</p>
        <p>New York's fall Asian auction week is usually a fairly low-key affair compared with its spring counterpart, but it brings a few predictable rewards, among them the sales exhibitions at Kaikodo. Some of these are thematically more focused than others; the current version is pretty loose, though the sheer number of Chinese and Japanese paintings is a major lure. New Yorkers just don't get to see material in this quantity and variety outside museums.</p>

        <p>Kaikodo</p>
        <p>164 East 64th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>Through Oct. 21</p>
        <p>New York's fall Asian auction week is usually a fairly low-key affair compared with its spring counterpart, but it brings a few predictable rewards, among them the sales exhibitions at Kaikodo. Some of these are thematically more focused than others; the current version is pretty loose, though the sheer number of Chinese and Japanese paintings is a major lure. New Yorkers just don't get to see material in this quantity and variety outside museums.</p>
        <p>Highlights include an album painting of a flower, attributed to the 13th-century artist Qian Xuan (it's very fragile so you have to ask to see it), and a 17th-century scroll by Fu Shan, whose fractious writing is also in the Metropolitan Museum's current calligraphy show. Among the Japanese pieces on the third floor, look for a witty four-panel portrait of a family of gibbons, gold medal-acrobats all, attributed to Hasegawa Tohaku (1539-1610), along with some contemporary work of a rather high sugar content.</p>
        <p>Devotees of ceramics will find much to admire, and as always, there are odd-duck surprises, like a patch of Ming embroidery titled ''Five Poisons,'' which looks as bright as a board game but is woven with scorpions, snakes and poison toads. The motif is actually meant to repel evil, and you can read all about it in the well-produced, bicep-straining scholarly catalog, of a kind this gallery produces for each of its exhibitions.</p>
