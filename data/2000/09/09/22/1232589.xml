        <p>Eurelijus Zukauskas, a man Alonzo Mourning had never heard of before tonight, stepped to the foul line with 1 minute 9 seconds remaining.</p>
        <p>Mourning, the Miami Heat's All-Star center, had fouled Zukauskas, a 7-foot-2-inch Lithuanian center, and now a collection of relatively unknown Eastern European players could close to within 3 points of the United States -- probably two possessions away from electrifying the world, never mind the Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>''If a miracle were to ever happen, this was probably the instant,'' said Donn Nelson, the Lithuanian assistant coach.</p>
        <p>Zukauskas took a deep breath, bent his knees and squared to the basket. His first free throw bounced off the iron and so did the second. American basketball supremacy had survived for another day.</p>
        <p>Team USA 85, Lithuania 76.</p>
        <p>Logic: 0.</p>
        <p>Little made sense. The Lithuanians, coming closer to the United States men than any other team had in eight years, played the Game That Time Forgot tonight at the Dome in Olympic Park.</p>
        <p>Working the 30-second clock on each possession like an antiquated, four-corner North Carolina team, they clogged the lanes, got back on transition and held Vince Carter and one of the greatest collection of open-court performers to a mere 4 points on the fast break.</p>
        <p>But the Lithuanians also forgot to make their free throws, missing 16 of the 43 foul shots they took, including four in the final minutes.</p>
        <p>In Lithuania, it may go down as ''the day the Americans almost fell.'' In the States, it will be remembered as ''the afternoon we took a game off.''</p>
        <p>Nelson, the son of Dallas Mavericks Coach Don Nelson and an assistant for the Lithuanians for 10 years, said: ''We got lucky. They missed some shots and we played the perfect game in a lot of respects. But I still don't see it happening in my lifetime.''</p>
        <p>Carter scored 6 of his 12 points in the final 2:45, including a tough lay-in with 40 seconds left to push the lead to 7 points and effectively end the game. Along with Gary Payton and Kevin Garnett, he resorted to his usual preening and got into mild physical altercations with opposing defenders, who kept looking for a trash-talk translator so they could understand what one of their favorite American players was saying.</p>
        <p>The United States led by 47-41 at halftime, enough to make Coach Rudy Tomjanovich use some choice words for the sleepwalking National Basketball Association  All-Stars. Team USA seemed to be pulling away midway through the second half, but then the Lithuanians caught fire.</p>
        <p>''That's a little closer than we like it,'' said Steve Smith, whose 0-for-4 shooting night contributed to his team's 35.7 percent shooting percentage. ''Was I worried? Not really. But that was interesting. They played hard.''</p>
        <p>Never had an international team come within 10 points of the N.B.A. players. Since Michael Jordan and the league's band of global superstars were first allowed to compete in 1992, the closest any team came to the United States men was Spain, which lost by 15 points at the 1994 world championships in Toronto. The Americans' next closest competitor was Lithuania, which lost by 22 points in the Atlanta Olympics four years ago.</p>
        <p>That team featured the legendary international player Arvydas Sabonis, along with Sarunas Marciulionis and Arturas Karnisovas. Marciulionis is retired, while Sabonis and Karnisovas missed the trip to Sydney because of injuries.</p>
        <p>''This Lithuanian team is capable of following a game plan, unlike the Lithuanian teams of old,'' Nelson said. ''Believe it or not, I thought this team had a better shot at winning than the others because of that.''</p>
        <p>The game was played almost in slow motion, with the sellout crowd of 8,391 at times barely reacting, or maybe having trouble believing what was happening. The crowd finally exploded with 2:11 remaining when Mindaugas Timinskas scored inside to trim Team USA's lead to 79-74 after it had been up by 14 points, its largest lead of the game.</p>
        <p>He drew a foul against Allan Houston on the play, and had a chance to cut the Americans' lead to 4, but missed.</p>
        <p>A minute later, Zukauskas drew the foul against Mourning with 1:09 left. But Zukauskas caught the rim both times, drawing sighs from the crowd.</p>
        <p>It all seemed surreal, even more so since the game was played only hours after the Knicks had traded Patrick Ewing to Seattle in a four-team deal that directly affected two Team USA players, Payton and Vin Baker, both of whom are with Seattle. Ewing's new teammates, sitting in the back of the team bus en route to the game, were congratulated by the other players.</p>
        <p>''Gary and me kept giving fives to each other in the back, soaking it all in,'' Baker said. ''Alonzo came on the bus and said, 'Congratulations.' We feel like we made out.''</p>
        <p>They probably would not have felt that way if they had been riding that bus as victims of one of the biggest upsets in Olympics history, ranking close to the 1980 Soviet hockey team's loss to the United States and the 1972 American men's basketball team's loss to the Soviets.</p>
        <p>But Baker said such thoughts never entered his mind.</p>
        <p>''You weren't watching the faces of the Lithuanian players at the end of the game,'' he said. ''Their faces weren't telling you they were thinking about winning. Their victory was just getting as close as they did. In order to win that kind of game, you've got to execute in the final minutes, make big buckets. I could be wrong, but they seemed pretty happy to be where they were.''</p>
