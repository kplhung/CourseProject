        <p>Peru's military leaders publicly backed President Alberto K. Fujimori early today, ending five days of silence during which there were widespread fears that the armed forces might move to oust the president.</p>
        <p>In a statement released after hours of meetings, the Armed Forces Joint Command and the National Police said they respected Mr. Fujimori's authority and his decision last week to dismantle the intelligence service and call for new elections (though the statement did not specifically mention the elections). The statement also said that despite worries of a coup, there had been no meeting of regional military leaders with the commanding general.</p>
        <p>But the military officials stopped short of criticizing the National Intelligence Service or its elusive chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. The statement avoided any mention of Mr. Montesinos, a close adviser to Mr. Fujimori who was caught on tape last week apparently bribing an opposition congressman. Mr. Montesinos has not been seen publicly since Mr. Fujimori's announcement last Saturday, prompting allegations that he was still running the intelligence service.</p>
        <p>''It falls upon Fujimori to now say what will happen,'' said Santiago Pedraglio, a political analyst. ''The military said nothing in the communique about Montesinos because that is up to the president. They put the ball in his court.''</p>
        <p>The United States welcomed the military's show of support for Mr. Fujimori, according to a spokesman for the United States Embassy. Last night the American ambassador, John R. Hamilton, visited the president to express continued support for his steps toward a new election, in which he does not plan to run.</p>
        <p>The military statement eased the fears of many who had heard rumors of troop movements and meetings. Mr. Pedraglio said the military must have also realized the danger in entertaining such thoughts, given the international attention.</p>
        <p>''The military -- with this external pressure and Fujimori's calling for elections -- did not have the least political reason for a coup,'' Mr. Pedraglio said. ''I do not think they could have found any important civilian to head such a coup.''</p>
        <p>The military's decision not to criticize Mr. Montesinos was not unexpected, since he is a former military officer who used his influence to place some members of his military academy class in important posts. The military's delay in sending a public signal reflected these close ties and competing concerns, said Carlos Tapia, a former lecturer at the Army Intelligence School.</p>
        <p>One big remaining question is Mr. Montesinos's fate. Opposition groups are demanding that he be arrested as the first step toward resolving the crisis. President Fujimori has insisted that Mr. Montesinsos is entitled to due process.</p>
        <p>But opposition leaders are unconvinced, and took little comfort from the military's somewhat muted pledge of allegiance.</p>
        <p>''I understand their desire is to show support for the president's decision,'' said Alejandro Toledo, who abandoned his challenge to Mr. Fujimori in this year's presidential election after accusing the government of fraud. ''I want to wait and see if the president will issue a decree and fire Montesinos and put him in jail. Then we will see how the military will behave.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Toledo has insisted that his party would not take part in any talks about elections until Mr. Fujimori acts against Mr. Montesinos.</p>
        <p>Opposition legislators have taken a similar line, and they boycotted a session of Congress today where lawmakers discussed investigations into the bribery videotape and the proposed elections. Some groups have called for a transitional government or the dissolution of the Congress as a condition for new elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori has insisted that he will remain in power until he hands over the presidential sash to his successor next July 28. In doing so, he retains a measure of influence and control over the process.</p>
        <p>At the same time, his supporters in Congress are trying to water down the case against Mr. Montesinos, which may be a prelude to a trial where Mr. Montesinos either is found not guilty or is given a suspended sentence.</p>
