        <p>One day last June, lawyers for the tobacco industry received an unsolicited e-mail message in their offices in New York and elsewhere around the country offering a trove of secret information in return for millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>The sender, ''FlyGuyNYt,'' said he had a copy of the internal trial plan for lawyers who had filed a huge lawsuit against the tobacco industry, which was about to be tried in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The defense team called the plaintiff's lawyers, Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe in Manhattan, and told them about the leak of information. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was called in, and after a brief undercover sting operation, arrested two brothers from Staten Island, identified as Said and Yeazid Farraj.</p>
        <p>Court records show that Said Farraj worked as a paralegal at Orrick, Herrington for about a month, then took a job as a summer intern at the state attorney general's office in New York. He is now in his final year at Quinnipiac University School of Law in Hamden, Conn. A spokesman there would not comment on his status.</p>
        <p>Both brothers have been released on $50,000 personal recognizance bond, and federal prosecutors said in court papers filed this week that they were in plea negotiations with the lawyers for the two men.</p>
        <p>The tobacco lawyers have not been identified, and lawyers for the two brothers did not return phone messages left at their offices yesterday. The court papers filed by the prosecutor, Joseph V. De Marco, indicate nothing about what kinds of plea offers may be made to the two men.</p>
        <p>But as an F.B.I. agent, Trenton J. Schmatz, described in a federal complaint, the scheme to sell the secret trial plan quickly unraveled after the defense lawyers reported what had happened. The trial plan had been prepared by Orrick, Herrington lawyers and paralegals working collectively for hundreds of hours, the complaint says, and was maintained in the law firm's computer system in its New York office. The existence of the complaint was first reported on The Smoking Gun Web site.</p>
        <p>The plan gave details on the plaintiff's trial strategy in a case in which the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, which had paid out billions of dollars in claims by asbestos workers, was now suing the tobacco industry, which it says had contributed to its liability.</p>
        <p>The e-mail message from FlyGuy to the defense team included an attachment of about 80 pages, out of more than 400, of the secret document, the complaint says.</p>
        <p>Posing as a defense lawyer in the tobacco lawsuit, Mr. Schmatz, the F.B.I. agent, said he wrote back to FlyGuy, expressing interest in obtaining the trial plan. FlyGuy wrote back, offering the entire trial document for $3 million, or one-tenth of 1 percent of the $3 billion settlement demand that FlyGuy said the plaintiffs were seeking, the complaint says.</p>
        <p>''FlyGuy also stated that he believed the asking price was a reasonable amount,'' Agent Schmatz wrote, ''since, in FlyGuy's opinion, the defendants, tobacco companies, might very well lose a jury verdict.''</p>
        <p>In the next few weeks, the agent wrote, more e-mail messages arrived from FlyGuy, who said that the trial plan was a recent version, copied on June 14, and that he was lowering the asking price to $2 million. On July 20, FlyGuy asked for a meeting so that the sale could take place. He suggested a McDonald's restaurant at 160 Broadway.</p>
        <p>FlyGuy said that he would be sending a representative called Ron. The next day, Agent Schmatz went to the McDonald's, carrying a duffel bag that contained $200,000. He met the man called Ron, who said that after the money was paid, he would have the trial plan sent by e-mail to the defense team.</p>
        <p>Soon thereafter, the man known as Ron was arrested and identified as Yeazid Farraj, the agent said in the affidavit. Mr. Farraj then said that his brother, Said, had copied the information when he worked at the law firm as a paralegal and had asked him to assist in the plan. Said Farraj was arrested soon thereafter.</p>
        <p>The plaintiff's lawyers praised their adversaries yesterday. ''They did exactly the right thing,'' said Michael T. Stolper, a lawyer at Orrick, Herrington, recalling the decision by the tobacco industry lawyers to get in touch with the plaintiff's firm. ''They didn't look at it. They deleted it. They cooperated with the F.B.I. These are folks who have documents stolen from them. They know what it's like. They couldn't have responded more appropriately.''</p>
