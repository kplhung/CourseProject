        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>CHRISTINE ANDREAS, the Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. With her high sweet soprano and eager  intensity. Ms. Andreas embodies an eternal ingenue who is just waking up to the realization that life doesn't have a fairy-tale ending. Although the smart Brazilian-flavored arrangements for a pop-jazz quartet led by Lee Musiker don't always match her floating Broadway lyricism, Ms. Andreas leaves her romantic imprint on songs like ''He Loves  Me,'' ''How Insensitive,'' ''And So It Goes'' and Dave Frishberg's wonderful, little-known  ballad ''Listen Here.'' Through Oct. 14. Tuesdays through Saturday nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $60 at tables, no minimum; dinner available but not required 6 p.m. to midnight (Stephen Holden).</p>

        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>CHRISTINE ANDREAS, the Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. With her high sweet soprano and eager  intensity. Ms. Andreas embodies an eternal ingenue who is just waking up to the realization that life doesn't have a fairy-tale ending. Although the smart Brazilian-flavored arrangements for a pop-jazz quartet led by Lee Musiker don't always match her floating Broadway lyricism, Ms. Andreas leaves her romantic imprint on songs like ''He Loves  Me,'' ''How Insensitive,'' ''And So It Goes'' and Dave Frishberg's wonderful, little-known  ballad ''Listen Here.'' Through Oct. 14. Tuesdays through Saturday nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $60 at tables, no minimum; dinner available but not required 6 p.m. to midnight (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>''BERLIN TO BROADWAY WITH KURT WEILL,'' Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 239-6200. If this is not a flawless revue, it is nevertheless an ingratiating tribute to Kurt Weill's achievement. Tonight, Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Wednesdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; added performance Sunday at 4:30 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>JACKIE CAINE AND ROY KRAL, Firebird Cafe, 363 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 586-0244. Now in their 70's, the long-running husband-and-wife duo are still the exemplars of a comfortable jazz gentility that incorporates improvisatory vocal riffs into semiformal pop-jazz settings. The high points of their new show are three collaborations by Mr. Kral with the London-based lyricist Fran Landesman on songs that take a long ''senior'' view of life and its losses. Tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Also at the Firebird Cafe, Sunday at 7 p.m., Marcy Heisler and Zina Goldrich, as part of the songwriters series; at 9 p.m., Barbara Fasano. Cover: $20 plus $15 minimum. Wednesday at 9 and 11, K. T. Sullivan and Larry Woodard, singers. Cover: $30; $15 minimum (Holden).</p>
        <p>* HOWARD FISHMAN QUARTET, Sardi's, 234 West 44th Street, (212) 221-8440. Powerful echoes of Stephane Grappelli and Bix Beiderbecke are among the influences rippling through the Howard Fishman Quartet's seamless swing. The group -- Mr. Fishman on guitar, banjo and vocals; Russell Farhang playing virtuosic Grappelli-style violin; Erik Jekabson on trumpet; Jonathan Flaugher all on bass -- folds elements of vintage jazz, swing and early bluegrass into rhythmically animated, richly allusive jazz chamber music. Whether the music is Stephen Foster (a bubbly ''Old Folks at Home''), Gershwin (''Soon'') or Romberg (''When I Grow Too Old to Dream''), it is all translated into lilting, fine-tuned ensemble music that transcends time and idiom. Fridays at 10:30 p.m. No cover charge, but $15 minimum at tables (Holden).</p>
        <p>* DAME CLEO LAINE, Feinstein's, at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. The English pop-jazz contralto with the coloratura frills remains in remarkable total control of her phenomenal vocal technique despite being in her early 70's. But the tricks are just frills compared to the subtle dramatic command she brings to numbers like a sultry, sexed-up ''Tea for Two'' (part of a Vincent Youmans medley) and a version of that aging diva warhorse ''When the World Was Young,'' which conveys a confident, settled self-knowledge. The high points of this rare cabaret date (the fall season opener at Feinstein's) also include revisits with several of her husband and musical partner John Dankworth's settings of Shakespeare's poetry, which the couple first recorded in 1964. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 and 11 p.m. Cover: $60 Tuesdays through Thursdays; $60 for the late show on Fridays and $75 for the early show; $75 Saturdays. Food and beverage minimum: $50 for early shows; $25 for late shows (Holden).</p>
        <p>KAREN MASON, Arci's Place, 450 Park Avenue South, at 30th Street, (212) 532-4370. The high-strung likable performer from Chicago still exudes the effervescent eagerness of a hometown drama student who has just arrived in New York bursting with starry-eyed ambition. Her new cabaret show concentrates on popular standards. High points include zany 60's cabaret numbers like Cy Coleman's and Carolyn Leigh's ''When In Rome'' and Stephen Sondheim's and Mary Rodgers's bossa nova spoof, ''The Boy From  . . . .'' But her big ballads are undermined by a tendency to overbelt. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11; Sunday nights at 8; Wednesday and Thursday nights at 9. Through Oct. 15. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Also at Arci's Place, Sunday at 3 p.m. (brunch begins at 1 p.m.) Lynn DiMenna, singer, in ''It's De-Lovely, It's DiMenna!'' Cover: $25; $19.95 prix fixe brunch or $15 minimum (Holden).</p>
        <p>*  MAUREEN MCGOVERN, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 840-6800. Ms. McGovern's gorgeous voice and the melodies of Richard Rodgers were meant for each other. The singer's demureness and sense of proportion prevent Rodgers and Hammerstein ballads like ''Climb Ev'ry Mountain'' and ''You'll Never Walk Alone'' from turning to mush. She brings a fine mixture of wit and precision to Rodgers and Hart standards like ''To Keep My Love Alive.'' Not only is the singer the closest American equivalent to Julie Andrews in her vocal prime, but she also adds a jazzy, coloratura panache. Through Oct. 14. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30; Tuesdays through Thursdays at 9 p.m. Cover: $50, with dinner required for early shows on Fridays and Saturdays; $15 minimum for other shows; suggested dinner arrival for early show is 7. Also at the Algonquin, Sunday jazz brunch at 2 p.m. (seating begins at 12:30 p.m.), Judy Barnett, singer. Cover: $50, includes brunch. International Festival of Cabaret: Sunday at 9 p.m., Natlie Gamsu, singer; Monday at 9 p.m., Michel Hermon, singer; $40 cover and $15 minimum; Sundays and Mondays through October (Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Reprise Room at Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes. He focuses on what he calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, whose creamy baritone echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock concentrates on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves that there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Tonight, Monday and Tuesday nights at 8, tomorrow and Wednesdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m., Sunday nights at 7:30. Tickets: $50 and $55; ringside seating, $75 and $80 (Holden).</p>
        <p>LAURIE BEECHMAN THEATER, West Bank Cafe, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 695-6909. ''Jamie deRoy and Friends,'' performing works by contemporary songwriters, including Marnie Baumer and Melanie Vaughan. Tomorrow night at 8:30 p.m. Cover: $20; one-drink minimum.</p>
        <p>BEMELMANS BAR, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. Peter Mintun, pianist. Tuesday through Saturday nights beginning at 9:30. Through Oct. 14. Cover: $15 at table and $5 at the bar; no minimum.</p>
