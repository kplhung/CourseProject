        <p>It is one of Broadway's grandest theaters, a triumph of restoration and modern stage technology, a handsome, big-time musical-theater theater. Its got location, history and class. So why, some Broadway types are asking, isn't the Ford Center for the Performing Arts booked?</p>
        <p>The theater, on West 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, was most recently the home of a revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' which closed a money-losing run on Sept. 3. It's not surprising that a new show hasn't opened since; stagehands at the Ford are still finishing the standard technical makeover that every theater undergoes after a show closes.</p>
        <p>What is surprising to some Broadway professionals, however, is that the theater has not yet booked a replacement. Almost every other major musical house on Broadway has a show running or on the horizon.</p>
        <p>But the theater may not be empty for long, if officials at SFX Entertainment, the theater's owner, have their way. (SFX acquired the theater last year when it bought Livent, the bankrupt Canadian production company.)</p>
        <p>John Barlow, spokesman for the SFX Theatrical Group, said yesterday that the group had narrowed the list to three potential spring bookings, all of which are revivals.</p>
        <p>They are ''42nd Street,'' whose latest incarnation opened on Sunday in Amsterdam; ''Wonderful Town,'' the 1953 Leonard Bernstein musical, which had a brief but acclaimed run at City Center in May; and ''West Side Story,'' another Bernstein gem, with lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by Arthur Laurents, which played La Scala in Milan in July.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barlow said a deal was expected in the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>Part of the reason for the Ford's vacancy is plain old bad luck. For many months it looked as if the next tenant would be the acclaimed British revival of ''Oklahoma!'' produced by Cameron Mackintosh. In July it was announced that the production would not come to New York because of its artistic team's scheduling conflicts.</p>
        <p>Such scheduling woes are not limited to SFX; the same fate also recently befell the Shubert Organization, which saw its long-planned spring production of the musical ''The Visit'' collapse because of the lack of a leading lady, meaning the Broadway Theater has no booking beyond Dec. 31.</p>
        <p>But the Ford Center also presents other challenges. The first is its size. With more than 1,800 seats the Ford is Broadway's second-largest theater, after the giant gray Gershwin (pop. 1,933). No one can accuse the Ford of being homely; its chandeliers are the best on Broadway, but its size makes it hard for smaller musicals.</p>
        <p>More important, the Ford may still be suffering from the curse of Garth. In 1997 the theater was restored -- or rather, recreated -- from two other theaters, the Lyric and Apollo. The builder was Garth Drabinsky, the flamboyant Canadian producer whose company, Livent, later went bankrupt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drabinsky had a yen for big contracts and because of deals struck with the unions the Ford emerged as one of the most expensive in New York to run. Part of this, too, went back to the theater's size; it takes a large staff to keep it running.</p>
        <p>But the theater also has several elements that increase costs, from its unusual marquee (all those light bulbs aren't cheap) to the fact that the presence of the Ford name on the theater limits other potential sponsorship deals.</p>
        <p>While conceding that the Ford is more expensive to run, Mr. Barlow said that the theater did not cost any more than any other theater on Broadway to maintain when it was dark. He also said that while the Ford's size might eliminate certain smaller productions, it also makes for an enormous potential gross. A sell-out week at the Ford can bring in more than $900,000.</p>
        <p>''It's got one of the highest gross potentials of any on Broadway,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When, of course, there's a show.</p>
        <p>Two in One</p>
        <p>When John Henry Redwood was a student at Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, he played both offense and defense in football. ''There were no squads back then,'' Mr. Redwood said, laughing. ''You went for the ball on one side of the field, and you went after the guy with the ball on the other.''</p>
        <p>That double duty was probably good training for Mr. Redwood, considering his recent schedule. Every morning he has been going to a rehearsal as the book writer and lyricist for ''The In-Gathering,'' a new musical presented by the New Professional Company at the Duke Theater on 42nd Street. In the evening he walks three blocks west to perform as as an actor in ''A Lesson Before Dying,'' at the Signature Theater Company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Redwood has long been artistically ambidextrous. A former marine who began acting in the mid-1970's, he has appeared in 10 productions of August Wilson's ''Fences'' alone, in regional theaters across the country. But theater aficionados may know him best as the author of ''The Old Settler,'' a portrait of an African-American woman battling  spinsterhood. The play, presented at Primary Stages in 1998, was one of the most produced new shows of the last two seasons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Redwood, who appears to be in his 50's -- his actor side wouldn't permit him to divulge his age -- said he came to writing as a diversion from a doctoral thesis. (He has two master's degrees, in history and religion.) ''I saw a book called 'How to Survive Your Ph.D. Dissertation' in the library, and one of the things it suggested was playwriting,'' Mr. Redwood said. ''They shouldn't have books like that in the library.''</p>
        <p>Along the Way</p>
        <p>*Laila Robins has been cast opposite Richard Thomas in Second Stage's production of Edward Albee's ''Tiny Alice.'' It opens in early December.</p>
        <p>*In something of a rarity, the cast of ''Copenhagen'' -- with no songs and even less dance -- will record its original cast recording on Thursday. The producer is Bruce Kimmel.</p>
        <p>*American Place Theater's next show is ''Tabletop,'' a comedy about the filming of a commercial: another rarity during the actors' strike. Performances begin in October.</p>
