        <p>Napoleon Bonaparte practically invented public relations. That's the message you get in the sumptuous exhibition that the dealer Ariane Dandois has organized here, ''The Empire Style and Its Conquest of Europe: 1800-1850'' (through Oct. 30). She decorated 11 rooms in her Place Beauvau gallery with antique Empire furniture, chandeliers and porcelains from France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Russia.</p>
        <p>Timed to coincide with the Biennale des Antiquaires, the big Paris antiques fair that continues through Oct. 1, the Dandois show has created a lot of buzz. This is partly because she and four other top Paris dealers -- Segoura, Kugel, Michel Meyer and Jean-Marie Rossi of Aveline -- all decided not to rent booths this year. Instead, they each organized shows in their own galleries.</p>

        <p>Napoleon Bonaparte practically invented public relations. That's the message you get in the sumptuous exhibition that the dealer Ariane Dandois has organized here, ''The Empire Style and Its Conquest of Europe: 1800-1850'' (through Oct. 30). She decorated 11 rooms in her Place Beauvau gallery with antique Empire furniture, chandeliers and porcelains from France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Russia.</p>
        <p>Timed to coincide with the Biennale des Antiquaires, the big Paris antiques fair that continues through Oct. 1, the Dandois show has created a lot of buzz. This is partly because she and four other top Paris dealers -- Segoura, Kugel, Michel Meyer and Jean-Marie Rossi of Aveline -- all decided not to rent booths this year. Instead, they each organized shows in their own galleries.</p>
        <p>The ambitious Dandois exhibition dazzles with elegant white Egyptian-style Swedish fauteuils, Russian mahogany armchairs decorated with brass fillets in the shape of the rising sun, Italian gueridons resting on gilded goat heads, and lacquered bronze Spanish stools that sport female Egyptian heads as supports.</p>
        <p>But the show raises a question: how did the Empire style, created and perpetuated by Napoleon, come to be adopted by the monarchies that fought him tooth and nail? In Italy, Spain and Russia, the style was wholeheartedly embraced by the ruling elites and outlived the Emperor.</p>
        <p>Daniele Kriser, an assistant curator of decorative arts at the Louvre, mused: ''Is it the power of the style or the power of the man? Or is it the power of the style of the man?''</p>
        <p>''To many, Napoleon was a god,'' she continued. ''He still is. People forget the wars. He made France great. He created the civil code we still use today. After the French Revolution, there was great enthusiasm for starting a new life: Napoleon was the most revolutionary force in France, more important than the Revolution itself. He was an enormous patron of art and artists.''</p>
        <p>Her colleague Anne Dion, a Louvre curator specializing in the 19th century, does not credit Napoleon with inventing a new style. ''The Empire style is really the continuation of the Neoclassical style begun in the reign of Louis XVI,'' she said. ''Napoleon just put his own stamp on it.''</p>
        <p>And where did Napoleon get that stamp? Actually, it was from his wife, Josephine, said Bernard Chevallier, chief curator of Malmaison, Josephine's chateau outside of Paris, which is now a museum. ''In 1799 Josephine and Napoleon lived in Paris next to the Hotel Chauvelin, a house designed by two young architects, Charles Percier and Pierre-Francois-Leonard Fontaine. They were not that well known but they had published a book, 'Houses and Palaces of Rome.' Josephine greatly admired the Chauvelin house.''</p>
        <p>Napoleon trusted Josephine to oversee the renovation of Malmaison. The painter Jean-Louis David brought the architects to Malmaison, and Josephine hired them on the spot. There was only one condition. Napoleon was famously impatient (never taking more than 10 minutes to eat a meal) and insisted they take only 10 days to complete each room. He wanted the house done by 1800.</p>
        <p>The architects attacked the interiors at top speed. They put Roman-style vaulted arches in the library and had ancient grotesques painted on the walls. Josephine's beloved arabesques, inspired by the newly rediscovered walls of Pompeii, appeared on ceilings, textiles and Sevres porcelains. Wall panels sported depictions of the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece and Rome. Paris furniture makers created Napoleon's large writing desk with swan supports and tables with gilt bronze ram heads.</p>
        <p>At first, Napoleon hated the results. ''He thought the library looked like a sacristy and one of the tented rooms resembled a cage for bears at a fair,'' Mr. Chevallier said. But he saw the power of the symbols. After Malmaison, Napoleon put the two architects in charge of redecorating the palaces of the Louvre, Fontainebleau, Saint-Cloud and Compiegne.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chevallier said that Napoleon once remarked: ''I love antiquity. Everything that is big is beautiful.''</p>
        <p>Percier and Fontaine were perpetuating the ideas of the German art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann, who wrote in 1764: ''The only way for us to become great and, if possible, even inimitable, is through the imitation of the ancients.''</p>
        <p>Napoleon understood this better than anyone. He knew the best way to legitimize himself was to identify with the heroes of the ancient past. Right after the conquest of Egypt, he commissioned a new wallpaper that depicted him standing next to the pyramids of Giza, delivering peace and liberating the Egyptians from tyranny. Thereafter, the sphinx appeared on gueridons, furniture and candelabra. At the Sevres porcelain factory, designers incorporated pyramids and obelisks into the patterns for the Emperor's new vases.</p>
        <p>At the Biennale, Bernard Steinitz is selling an enormous pair of Empire mahogany pool-cue holders with gilded brass N's. He said that the bronzes had been signed by Pierre Thomire, a colleague of Percier and Fontaine, and that they might have been made for Napoleon. Galerie Perrin has a vase in Chinese porcelain mounted with bronze handles in the shape of rams, designed by Thomire. Jean-Luc Mechiche is selling a pair of Thomire torcheres from 1830.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dandois is selling a Sevres vase that Napoleon selected as a New Year's gift for his sister Caroline in 1811. It depicts Napoleon being crowned by the goddess Victory.</p>
        <p>And how was the Empire style diffused so quickly abroad? First, Percier and Fontaine disseminated their work through a series of engravings, in 1801. They were sent all over Europe, and were snapped up by Francophiles in Russia and America.</p>
        <p>In France, Ms. Dandois writes, ''Following the Emperor's example, the generals and bankers who had brought him to power all rushed to commission sumptuous furniture in the new style from furniture makers like Jacob-Desmalter, Bellange and Marcion, and gilt bronzes from the foremost bronziers, Thomire, Galle and Feuchere.'' (Bellange was commissioned to do much of the furniture for the Monroe White House after the British burned the building in the War of 1812.)</p>
        <p>Napoleon installed his family on thrones in Italy, the Netherlands and Germany, Ms. Dandois noted. When Lucien Bonaparte was sent as ambassador to Madrid in 1801, the king, Charles IV, commissioned Percier and Fontaine to decorate a Pompeiian room, Casa del Labrador, at the Aranguez Palace. This led the Duchess of Alba to order Empire furniture, still in the family's Liria Palace in Madrid. Ms. Dandois is selling four bronze stools with Egyptian heads from the Casa del Labrador.</p>
        <p>When Napoleon's sister Caroline and her husband became queen and king of Naples, they redecorated the royal palaces of Naples, Caserta and Portici with Empire furniture and gilt bronzes from Paris, said Ms. Dandois, who is selling four gilded armchairs from Naples, circa 1810.</p>
        <p>Napoleon's sister Elisa Bacciochi was sent to Lucca, Italy, and then Florence. In 1809 she became grand duchess of Tuscany and began to commission suites of Empire pieces.</p>
        <p>So the Empire style spread. Until, amazingly, it was adopted by the Bourbons as the court style when they returned to power.</p>
