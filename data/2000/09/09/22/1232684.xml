        <p>The New York State Democratic Committee began broadcasting this 30-second advertisement yesterday.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Axelrod &amp; Associates</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- As with several previous advertisements supporting Hillary Rodham Clinton, this one focuses on Representative Rick A. Lazio's tax proposal and his stand on Medicare. The spot opens with white words on a black screen that ask whether Mr. Lazio can be trusted. He is shown standing at a lectern with Newt Gingrich, then sitting next to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas at a meeting. This is the first time that a Democratic commercial has used an image of Mr. Bush in this Senate campaign. During both scenes, the narration criticizes Mr. Lazio's economic policies. The advertisement ends by repeating the two images of Mr. Lazio next to Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Bush.</p>

        <p>The New York State Democratic Committee began broadcasting this 30-second advertisement yesterday.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Axelrod &amp; Associates</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- As with several previous advertisements supporting Hillary Rodham Clinton, this one focuses on Representative Rick A. Lazio's tax proposal and his stand on Medicare. The spot opens with white words on a black screen that ask whether Mr. Lazio can be trusted. He is shown standing at a lectern with Newt Gingrich, then sitting next to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas at a meeting. This is the first time that a Democratic commercial has used an image of Mr. Bush in this Senate campaign. During both scenes, the narration criticizes Mr. Lazio's economic policies. The advertisement ends by repeating the two images of Mr. Lazio next to Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''Can we trust Rick Lazio to fight for us? He helped write the Gingrich budget slashing Medicare. Now Lazio's trying to hide the true cost of his trillion-dollar tax plan. Like the Bush plan, experts say Lazio's would eat up the surplus, leaving no money to pay off the debt and extend the life of Social Security and Medicare. Hillary's plan? Affordable tax cuts, to help families pay for college and long-term care, and to help small businesses create jobs. Tell Lazio he's not fighting for us. Not then. Not now.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- This commercial, like several others produced by supporters of Mrs. Clinton, tries to hold Mr. Lazio responsible for supporting Mr. Gingrich's plan to slash $270 million from Medicare. But Mr. Lazio voted to cut the rate of growth of Medicare, not the actual budget, as his campaign has repeatedly pointed out. The advertisement also castigates Mr. Lazio's tax plans by saying the proposals would leave no surplus. In fact, those plans would leave several million dollars of surplus, his campaign aides say. Although Mr. Lazio initially said his plan would cost $775 billion over 10 years, people have pointed out that it would be closer to $1 trillion.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The first line in the commercial raises the question of trust, one that Mrs. Clinton's campaign has been trying to raise with Mr. Lazio. It takes a swipe at a Lazio advertisement saying he is ''one of us.'' By associating Mr. Lazio with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gingrich, the spot seeks to project the image of conservative politicians whose policies could spell economic disaster for middle-class New Yorkers.</p>
