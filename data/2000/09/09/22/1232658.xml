        <p>After 39 years working on the state railroad, Momir Peulic makes less than $40 a month. Stores here have no cooking oil or sugar at state prices he can afford. But in Sunday's elections for Yugoslav president, he will vote wholeheartedly for the incumbent, Slobodan Milosevic, and his party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic has run this country since 1987. But, for the first time since 1992, he is running for direct election, and opinion polls indicate that he is trailing the main opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica.</p>
        <p>But even the opposition expects Mr. Milosevic to declare victory. He called the election early, apparently determined to cement his hold on power. And he has the support of many Serbs who, like Mr. Peulic, credit the unceasing message of Mr. Milosevic and his media that the current president is better than the foreign-financed opposition that would oust him.</p>
        <p>''It's a very important moment for the existence of our people and our state,'' said Mr. Peulic, who is 59. ''These are elections about the future.'' He agrees that people are dissatisfied with their lives, but he blames foreigners more than Mr. Milosevic, and he does not trust the promises of the democratic opposition or Mr. Kostunica.</p>
        <p>''This opposition just complains and does nothing for the country,'' said Mr. Peulic, echoing the arguments of the government and the state-controlled media. ''I'll vote for Milosevic, because he will give the people a better life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Peulic's colleague, Dragoljub Savic, a train driver, is even more fervent.</p>
        <p>''I've been in Germany and Slovenia, and I don't think anyone in the world lives as well as here,'' he said, while even Mr. Peulic looked on with polite incredulity. ''A lot of our troubles come from abroad, and this so-called opposition of ours gets a lot of money to destroy this system. I'll vote for Milosevic because he protected Serbhood.''</p>
        <p>This small city of 135,000 people, 40 miles southeast of Belgrade along the Danube, was an ancient capital of Serbia and is graced by the striking remains of its 15th century castle. It is full of political posters, but nearly all of them are for Mr. Milosevic and the candidates of his ruling Socialist People's Party, which runs the town.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, who has drawn substantial crowds on the campaign trail, has supporters here, particularly among the young. There are a few Kostunica posters pasted too high to cover or despoil, and some stickers, produced by a student movement, Otpor, showing its symbol, a clenched fist, and the slogan ''He's finished.''</p>
        <p>Spray-painted in English across an apartment block is the epigram ''Mind evolution/State revolution.''</p>
        <p>But random interviews here show significant support for Mr. Milosevic, and significant impact from the government's campaign to discredit Mr. Kostunica and the opposition, which it portrays as NATO traitors, incompetents and feckless toadies.</p>
        <p>And even some of those who support Mr. Kostunica are nervous about expressing that support, saying they are worried about possible retribution, in their jobs or pensions, from the ruling coalition. Mr. Milosevic, they believe, has no intention of losing this election. In Smederevo, and elsewhere in Serbia, the atmosphere is mostly quiet, but tense.</p>
        <p>Zelimir Stojanic, 30, says he might vote but isn't sure it will matter. ''We've been 10 years suffering under these authorities, and for the next 10 years we'll suffer under them,'' he said, sitting on a bench near the ruined castle walls with his wife, daughter and friends. ''It's unbelievable the way the regime manipulates people. They say everything is fine and can't be better as they line up in the morning to try to find some cooking oil.''</p>
        <p>From her perch on her boyfriend's lap, Brankica Stanojevic, a 19-year-old with dyed orange hair, said she would vote. ''I'll vote for Kostunica,'' she said, ''just because he's not Milosevic.''</p>
        <p>Tijana Stojanic, 22, Zelimir's wife and a law student, reached down to touch her daughter, Vanja, 1 month old. ''She's for changes, too.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stanojevic laughed and said, ''Well, maybe she needs changing.''</p>
        <p>The people are nervous about retribution if they vote against the ruling class, Mr. Stojanic said. ''Maybe 70 percent of the people in this place are for them, and 30 percent are afraid of repression. They're worried about losing their jobs or their pensions. A lot of people think like me and are afraid. And we have a lot of refugees from Kosovo.''</p>
        <p>Near the railroad station, in a row of warehouses, people gathered to get aid from the International Committee for the Red Cross. But an official there shooed a journalist away, and those receiving the aid, refugees from Kosovo, said they did not want to talk.</p>
        <p>In the neat center of the town, a pedestrian zone surrounding the church and courthouse, a newspaper vendor said there were few copies of independent journals, which sell out early in the morning. She gets only about 20 copies of the popular independent tabloid Blic, which has had its newsprint supplies restricted.</p>
        <p>''I used to get 50 copies,'' she said.</p>
        <p>There was a pile of the state newspaper, Politika. How many does she sell?</p>
        <p>''About three a day,'' she said, laughing.</p>
        <p>She will vote for Mr. Kostunica, she said.</p>
        <p>Nearby, in the Coka supermarket, a saleswoman also laughed when asked if there was sugar or cooking oil to buy. ''We had some oil a few days ago, but not much,'' she said. ''We only let people buy a bottle or two.'' At state-controlled prices, oil is 16 dinars a liter when available, or about 25 cents, while sugar is 9 dinars a kilo. In the open market, which railroad workers like Mr. Peulic and Mr. Savic say they cannot afford, oil can be had for 50 or 60 dinars, she said, while sugar is 25.</p>
        <p>The shortages are unusual for a pre-election period, when the government normally floods the shops with cheap sugar, oil, milk and meat, said Miroljub Labus, an economist and chairman of a group of policy experts that supports the opposition. Salaries and pensions are also late, he said, an indication of how little money Mr. Milosevic's government has to spread around, and of his reluctance to destroy the dinar by printing too many new notes.</p>
        <p>''But this is a small country, self-sufficient in food, and it won't collapse over the economy,'' Mr. Labus said. Many people still have savings, or get money from relatives among the millions of Serbs living and working abroad, he said. And people are used to getting by through contacts and economies.</p>
        <p>At a small, state-owned clothing shop on the main square, Milkica Ivanovic stood smoking a cigarette beside a rack of cheap leather jackets and cotton dresses. ''Business isn't wonderful,'' she said. ''People don't have money.'' Whom does she blame?</p>
        <p>''After any war we have difficulties,'' she said. ''It's not normal, it's recovery, and they are doing a good job at reconstructing the country.'' She isn't very interested in politics, she said. ''But I'm still for this government. They've done a lot.''</p>
        <p>A bridge near here, bombed by NATO, has been fixed, she said, as well as a Jugopetrol installation, and the government is building apartments for young couples.</p>
        <p>''Reconstruction is hard,'' Mrs. Ivanovic said. ''It was the same after the First and Second World Wars. No one makes enough money and everyone wants to live better, and no one's very satisfied. And there are shortages, it's true, but people are somehow managing.''</p>
        <p>Tomislav Stanojkovic, 20, walked by, wearing a sweatshirt with the bold phrase ''Promene,'' or changes, the opposition slogan. ''Of course there is a chance for change if we had free and fair elections,'' he said, shaking his shaven head. ''If the opposition makes a serious defense of the vote after the election, it will be fine.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica visited here and got a good crowd, but people are afraid to vote for him, fearing for their jobs if he loses, Mr. Stanojkovic said. ''Still,'' he said of the ruling party, ''the end is coming for them. Nothing can save them forever.''</p>
