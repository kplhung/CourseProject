      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial deplores amount of 'soft money' that is being raised in New York State US Senate contest between Repr Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton, noting Clinton has been prodigious raiser of soft money; holds both candidates should adopt soft-money ban on principle</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>For months now, Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton have insisted that they are perfectly willing to keep ''soft money'' out of the New York Senate race provided that the other makes the first move. It is time for both candidates to stop their  maneuvering and reach an agreement to ban campaign fund-raising and spending practices that destroy the integrity of the electoral system.</p>
        <p>The issue of campaign finance is back on the table with Mr. Lazio's aggressive proposal to Mrs. Clinton at their first debate that they both pledge to ban the use of soft money. This would give Mr. Lazio a tactical advantage, since he has more ''hard money'' on hand than she does. But both candidates should adopt a soft-money ban on principle.</p>

        <p>For months now, Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton have insisted that they are perfectly willing to keep ''soft money'' out of the New York Senate race provided that the other makes the first move. It is time for both candidates to stop their  maneuvering and reach an agreement to ban campaign fund-raising and spending practices that destroy the integrity of the electoral system.</p>
        <p>The issue of campaign finance is back on the table with Mr. Lazio's aggressive proposal to Mrs. Clinton at their first debate that they both pledge to ban the use of soft money. This would give Mr. Lazio a tactical advantage, since he has more ''hard money'' on hand than she does. But both candidates should adopt a soft-money ban on principle.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has been a prodigious raiser of soft money, the unlimited and largely unregulated donations made by corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals to political parties for party-building activities. Such money is not supposed to be used to help specific candidates, but both parties now routinely use soft money to promote candidates in sham ''issue'' ads, thus evading federal laws that limit direct donations to political candidates. Mrs. Clinton has relied substantially on Democratic Party ads that have been paid for in part by unregulated soft money, a good portion of which she raised herself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has not raised soft money for his campaign, and recently closed down a questionable state political action committee that also allowed his contributors to bypass the federal contribution limits. But he has benefited from anti-Clinton television ads financed with soft money by the state's  Conservative Party and from radio ads paid for by the state Republican Party. He has also been helped by outside groups that are vehemently opposed to Mrs. Clinton and are spending on his behalf.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has rightly insisted that any ban on soft money also include a ban on expenditures by outside groups. This week Mr. Lazio offered pledges from 14 such groups -- named by the Clinton campaign -- to stop their activities in this race. Michael Long, chairman of the Conservative Party, has said he too will stop his ads provided that Mrs. Clinton signs the pledge against soft money. But William Powers, chairman of the state Republican party, has not yet backed a specific soft-money ban. To make this deal work, Mr. Lazio will have to show he can control his party leaders on this matter.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Lazio can come through with assurances from the Republican Party, Mrs. Clinton will be in no position to reject a soft-money ban. She may feel at a disadvantage since she has less hard money -- money raised within the federal contribution limits of $1,000 for individuals per election and $5,000 for political action committees -- than Mr. Lazio at this time. But she surely has the ability to raise more hard money to get her political message out.</p>
        <p>For years, political strategists brushed off sleazy campaign finance tactics as non-issues for most voters. That seems to have changed with Senator John McCain's run for the presidential nomination. Voters are increasingly impatient with candidates who flout campaign finance laws. They may well punish the candidate who scuttles this deal.</p>
