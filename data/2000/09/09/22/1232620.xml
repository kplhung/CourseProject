        <p>For 27 years, Fred Wilber has run a quirky music store called Buch Spieler in downtown Montpelier, Vt., population of roughly 8,000. The store, which sells out-of-print movie soundtracks, among other goodies, has had its ups and downs, but in 1998, as Internet music distributors like CDNow and MP3.com exploded in popularity, Mr. Wilber began to worry that the Web would be his Waterloo.</p>
        <p>His answer was to build his own Web site (www.bsmusic.com). Designed by his brother and lacking time-saving features like one-click shopping, it is hardly slick. But it has been successful.</p>
        <p>In the year and a half since the site went into service, Mr. Wilber says overall sales have jumped 10 percent. Just as important, he estimates, the Internet has expanded his customer base by some 20 percent. It turns out that Mr. Wilber's peculiar tastes have been strengths on the Web. When the site was recently sent an e-mail message requesting the score from ''Gordy! The Little Pig That Hit It Big!'' a 1995 movie, he simply took it off the shelf and shipped it.</p>
        <p>''It is not easy e-commerce,'' Mr. Wilber said of his Web site. ''But we are not trying to compete with Amazon. We focus on our own niche.''</p>
        <p>To many experts, the advent of the Internet seemed to signal a grim future for mom-and-pop retailers. Increased competition and the availability of a diverse array of merchandise to populations that had been essentially captive audiences threatened to erode their customer base.</p>
        <p>But a survey of more than 1,500 businesses in 16 downtown commercial districts nationwide, released earlier this month by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, indicates that the Internet can spur sales in storefront retail businesses. Just as they compete in the brick-and-mortar world against big-box enemies like Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot, small retailers seem to do best in the virtual world by focusing on unusual products or aiming to give excellent, personalized customer service.</p>
        <p>The National Trust is a nonprofit organization that develops programs to support and maintain historic downtown areas. And because the survey canvassed only merchants in towns where some revitalization of historic downtown areas is under way, the National Trust said its results probably overstate the positive impact of the Web on all small businesses. Even so, the news was surprisingly upbeat.</p>
        <p>The trust's survey, one of the first in the nation to examine the impact of e-commerce on small retailers, found that some 16.4 percent of Main Street businesses it polled were already using the Internet to sell things. Further, the survey found, merchants that sell online -- with most of them starting their Web sites only within the last 18 months -- have experienced a 12.8 percent increase in overall sales. On average,  14.3 percent of their total sales are now attributable to the Internet.</p>
        <p>Small, specialized businesses ''are really starting to gravitate toward the Web,'' said Kennedy Smith, director of the National Trust's Main Street Center. ''The thing that was a surprise was the extent to which it was helping them.'' For a struggling storefront operation, a 5 percent increase in sales can make the difference between shutting its doors or staying open, Ms. Smith said.</p>
        <p>The news about small storefront retailers presents a stark contrast to larger, purely e-commerce retailers.  Many experts once suggested that even individual entrepreneurs working out of homes and garages -- selling everything from books to bow ties -- would prosper on the Internet as barriers to entry were eliminated. But as it has turned out, while several of these pure e-retailers had jumps in sales initially, they are now struggling to make money as the challenges of marrying cyberspace and the real world have become clear. Hundreds of these operations are now cutting back or going out of business entirely.</p>
        <p>Established name-brand retailers, so-called clicks-and-mortars, have also had their share of tribulations on the Internet. While many have recorded strong sales through their online arms, it has often come at enormous cost. To sustain the level of service associated with their stores, most big-name retailers have had to do everything from hire new workers to set up a separate warehouse operation to handle the orders.</p>
        <p>There is no way to know exactly how many small storefront merchants do business over the Web, but their ranks are already in the tens of thousands and growing. As of May, some 29 percent of all American small businesses -- from retailers to public relations firms -- had Web sites, according to the Kelsey Group, a consulting firm specializing in local advertising and e-commerce. That is up from 23 percent in May of last year.</p>
        <p>Of this Web-connected minority, almost half are selling goods over the Internet, according to the Kelsey Group, which gets its information from a survey of a national panel of 600 businesses with fewer than 100 employees.</p>
        <p>The use of the Web by small retailers is likely to accelerate because many larger companies, hoping that small businesses could be revenue generators, have been intensifying efforts to bring mom-and-pop stores online over the course of the last year.</p>
        <p>Last September, for example, Amazon.com started zShops, a service that allows small businesses to have a link to their products pop up when a visitor to Amazon clicks on a relevant book or compact disc. A seller of spice grinders, say, could arrange for a link to appear every time a person clicked on a book about Indian cooking.</p>
        <p>Web developers of all sizes -- from Microsoft to tiny outfits run by a couple of a guys in a college dorm -- are offering small businesses access to a range of Web services, from Web site design to purchasing banner advertising. In fact, the business of providing Web services to small operators has already become competitive enough that many of the mom-and-pop retailers said their entry costs had been very reasonable.</p>
        <p>James and Mary DeFore, for example, own a women and children's store called Unique Boutique in downtown Thomasville, Ga., a small city of about 20,000 people. They were doing a healthy side business in prom dresses, and decided that if they offered them on the Web they might attract rural customers who could not get into town. So last January, they hired a local service provider, who for a few hundred dollars designed a simple but colorful Web site with the catchy name Time for Prom (timeforprom.com).</p>
        <p>The site went live in February, and by March, the DeFores were getting up to 40,000 visitors to their Web site each month. By June, they had nearly 500 orders for dresses that cost $150 to $200. And requests came not just from rural areas in Georgia but also from Missouri and West Virginia and even Hawaii and Japan. ''The biggest problem,'' Mr. DeFore said, ''was fulfilling all the orders.''</p>
        <p>Despite not having a powerful brand name or being linked to a powerful portal like Yahoo or America Online, Time for Prom shows that small retailers need not get lost in the vast clutter on the Internet if they develop a clear, narrow identity.</p>
        <p>In fact, another Thomasville retailer, Hi-Fi Sales and Service, which specializes in equipment for home theaters and live field recording, did $1.9 million in business over the Web last year, which represented a significant portion of its total sales, and now gets some 30 percent of its new customers online with no advertising.</p>
        <p>The key to the success of Hi-Fi Sales is making sure it is visible. ''We spend a lot of energy making sure we come up high in the search engines,'' said Jim Oade, one of the three brothers who co-own the business. Each search engine has different rules for deciding in what order to list businesses related to key words, he said. So one of the brothers, Doug Oade, devotes himself, among other things, to keeping current with the rules and making sure the company's Web site (www.oade.com) has enough of the right key words to pop up swiftly when a consumer wants audio products.</p>
        <p>The Oade brothers' national customer base is still fairly unusual among mom-and-pop ventures. Most storefront retailers use the Internet mainly for defending and cementing the relationship with customers they already have -- a relationship that is very much under siege by giant retailers.</p>
        <p>Osborn Drugs in Miami (pronounced Mi-AM-a), Okla., has been a family drugstore for 29 years. Since it started its Web site in 1996, sales through the Internet have increased only about 5 percent a year, according to Bill Osborn, who runs the store with his father. But more than 90 percent of the traffic on the Web site comes from regular long-term Osborn customers who just like to e-mail their prescriptions in. ''We view it as a way to service customers we already have,'' Bill Osborn said. ''We are not trying to go public as osborndrug.com.''</p>
