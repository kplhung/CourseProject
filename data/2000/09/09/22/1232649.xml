        <p>President Clinton gazed at a computer screen today at a community center for the disabled and -- using only the movement of his eyeballs -- haltingly typed out a two-word message: ''Good morning.''</p>
        <p>Never mind that it was well past noon or that the computer repeatedly misread the president's stare. By experimenting with the innovative technology, the president sought to draw attention to the possibilities that computers present to those with disabilities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, accompanied by administration aides who are disabled, said hooking up more handicapped people to the World Wide Web would integrate them into the economy and enable them to live fuller lives.</p>
        <p>''We all know that not everyone has shared in the American economic renaissance,'' the president said in a speech at Mott Community College. ''We all know there are people and places who have been left behind, including millions of Americans with significant disabilities who want to go to work, but whose path is blocked and who could work and contribute, not only to their own lives, but to the rest of us, as well.''</p>
        <p>As part of his continuing effort to bridge what the White House has labeled the digital divide, the president announced a variety of modest initiatives aimed at increasing the number of disabled people with access to computers.</p>
        <p>He said 45 technology companies had pledged to do more to make their products and services accessible to the disabled. And he announced that the Department of Education would provide $16 million in grants to make cyberspace more accessible.</p>
        <p>Studies show that only 24 percent of the country's 54 million people with disabilities have access to a computer, compared with 52 percent of those without disabilities. And a review of state and federal government Web sites by Darrell M. West, a Brown University professor, found that only 278 of 1,813 sites provided disability access.</p>
        <p>One site that has received positive reviews is the White House home page. Susan Scheer, executive director of the Center for Independence of the Disabled in New York, said two disabled people, one blind and one with a head injury, reviewed www.whitehouse.gov recently and ''both thought that it was very, very good.''</p>
        <p>White House aides said they chose to come to Flint because of an innovative computer center for the disabled here, not because of an embarrassing episode involving Vice President Al Gore this month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore apologized to Chad Swiatecki, a local reporter who uses a wheelchair, after the journalist wrote an article saying he was unable to cover a Gore campaign event because it was not accessible to the handicapped.</p>
        <p>Today, five wheel-chair-accessible vans were added to the motorcade to carry a few journalists and guests who were disabled.</p>
        <p>On his tour of the nonprofit Disability Network, Mr. Clinton tried the EyeGaze system that allows eye movements to control a cursor.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to do but if you train you can get it down,'' he said.</p>
