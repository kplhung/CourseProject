        <p>From Down Under to Midtown, Knicks players weighed in on the Patrick Ewing trade.</p>
        <p>Marcus Camby watched the local news Wednesday night, saw the scrolling headlines that his teammate was traded and promptly went to bed.</p>
        <p>''I didn't think it was really true because it went across there a couple of times before,'' Camby said yesterday afternoon during an appearance in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''When I woke up about 7 a.m., I heard the rumors on TV and radio,'' Camby said. ''I went to work out and then heard it coming back.''</p>
        <p>His reaction, for the second time since the first four-team trade was reported in August, was this: ''They've been talking about it for months now and they finally pulled the trigger. I'm definitely going to miss Pat. He's an integral part of our ball club, but we have to move on.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be tough because he's one of the heart and souls of our team. It's going to take some time to see how it all plays out.''</p>
        <p>Camby has also heard the rumors that this trade is not the Knicks' final answer, that he could be traded to bolster the frontcourt, even if Knicks General Manager Scott Layden said the current roster would be the one going to training camp.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't make you feel good,'' Camby said, ''but that's the way the business is. Especially here in New York, where everybody is supposed to be going everywhere. I've always wanted to stay here, but it's not up to me.''</p>
        <p>Those were also the sentiments of Allan Houston when he spoke with reporters at the Olympics in Sydney, Australia, where he is playing for Team USA. ''What's going to happen?'' he said. ''You never know. That's all I'm saying.'' Then Houston talked about the perimeter shooting the Knicks now have with Glen Rice, Latrell Sprewell and himself.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he believed all three could start, or play on the court together, Houston said: ''Anything's possible. Everybody said Spree and I wouldn't work.''</p>
        <p>Camby, too, wondered about the excess of guards on the Knicks in addition to three players, Larry Johnson, Sprewell and Rice, to play small forward. ''The new guys haven't come in, we haven't jelled, I haven't talked to anyone or seen anyone,'' Camby said. ''We just have to wait until everyone gets here and see how we play together. We definitely have to set up some chemistry.''</p>
        <p>The loss of Ewing will certainly have an impact, Camby knows, but he could not say if the team would be better without their lumbering center. ''That remains to be seen,'' Camby said. ''That's what a lot of people were talking about, that we'd be better off without him.</p>
        <p>''I wish he was still here, but it's in the past now.''</p>
        <p>Now, with Luc Longley at center, Camby harbors no illusions.</p>
        <p>''He's a center, he's won championships, he's a veteran,'' Camby said. ''He's definitely no Patrick Ewing, but he's definitely a guy who can add to our team.''</p>
        <p>Longley, the 31-year-old, 7-foot Australian, who was helping his national team defeat Russia when Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy called to tell him about the trade, feels the same way. ''I don't think we're going to advertise it as replacing Patrick Ewing,'' Longley said. ''I think they're gaining Luc Longley rather than replacing Patrick Ewing, and hopefully that will work.''</p>
        <p>Longley, who was the center on Michael Jordan's last three championship teams with the Chicago Bulls, welcomed the trade. ''New York has always been my favorite place to win, because it's the hardest place to win,'' Longley said.</p>
        <p>He also did not seem concerned about the amount of criticism he may face in New York. ''I think all fans are demanding, but I don't play for the fans,'' Longley said. ''I play for me and my teammates. I won't be able to do things different than I always do. Play my game, play hard and hopefully that will please them.''</p>
