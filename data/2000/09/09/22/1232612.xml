        <p>Bill Geist (''Cartwheels All the Way to Sydney,'' Op-Ed, Sept. 17) ridicules the potential inclusion of cheerleading, Frisbee, contract bridge and ballroom dancing in the Olympics.</p>
        <p>I agree with his apparent thesis that the Olympic Games have become overly complicated and have lost some of the purity of faster, higher and stronger as the competitive ethic. But as an amateur ballroom dancer, I take offense at his method of making this point.</p>
        <p>Competitive ballroom dancers, like any athletes, sacrifice time  and money, and train long hours to build strength, balance and precision.</p>
        <p>In addition, they must perfect grace and elegance on the floor.</p>
        <p>While the Olympics may not be the appropriate arena in which to exhibit their skills, ballroom dancers, cheerleaders, Frisbee players and others who work so hard should be given the credit they deserve for being competitive athletes at the highest level.</p>
