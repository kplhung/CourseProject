        <p>Reversing Wednesday's pattern, investors drove down the price of technology shares yesterday, ending a two-day rise in the Nasdaq composite index, while the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average, seen as a haven, managed its first gain in seven sessions.</p>
        <p>Analysts cited persistent worries over the high price of oil, the slumping euro and unease over coming profit reports and the November elections as the dominant market factors. In addition, some said that mutual funds had begun bailing out of losers and cashing in profits in winning stocks to prepare for year-end payouts to shareholders.</p>
        <p>''There's a bit of a flight to quality in what seems like an increasingly uncertain environment, especially in oil,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation. ''You see money going into big defensive names,'' like drug shares, which were particularly strong.</p>
        <p>The technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 68.57 points, or 1.8 percent, to 3,828.87. That is nearly 6 percent lower than at the start of the year and 24 percent below its record on March 10.</p>
        <p>Intel warned after the close of the market that third-quarter sales would fall short of estimates because of weaker European demand. Its shares, which closed at $61.48, down $1.58, plunged as low as $48.75 after hours. Analysts have expressed concern recently about slowing demand for personal computers.</p>
        <p>Abby Joseph Cohen, the Goldman, Sachs strategist who has long been bullish, called investors' fears about energy costs, the euro and corporate profits ''somewhat overdone'' and renewed her target of 1,575 for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index by the end of the year. The S.&amp; P. 500 showed little change yesterday, moving down 2.29 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,449.05. Losers outnumbered winners by 274 to 205.</p>
        <p>On the positive side, the Dow, paced by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Wal-Mart Stores and Merck, gained 77.60 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,765.52. Although many companies have warned of lower profits recently, 3M reassured Wall Street that it would meet expectations, and it rose $4.69, to $86.44.</p>
        <p>Goodyear Tire joined the list of companies warning on profit, however, after saying that it would break even at best in the third quarter and might even post a small loss. And it held out little hope for much improvement in the fourth quarter. Its share tumbled $2.88, to $18.13, barely one-third its price a year ago.</p>
        <p>Another loser was Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which dropped as low as $85.50 and finished at $89.44, down $6.50, after announcing a big quarterly earnings gain but one that was shy of Wall Street forecasts.</p>
        <p>Other brokerage stocks were also weak, with Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and A. G. Edwards all down more than $2.50.</p>
        <p>Oil stocks fell as UBS Warburg cut its rating of Exxon Mobil and the Clinton administration seemed to edge toward tapping the strategic reserve, an idea embraced yesterday by Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, Hertz climbed $7.38, to $31.63, after Ford offered to buy the 18.5 percent of stock it does not already own while Lernout &amp; Hauspie Speech Products slumped $6.13, to $15.13, after disclosing an investigation of its financial statements by the Securities and Exchange Commission. EBay, downgraded by two firms, slumped $5.38, to $71.19.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Rise  By Bloomberg News</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury note rose for the second time in six sessions as oil prices tumbled from 10-year highs, easing investor concerns.</p>
        <p>The price of the 10-year note rose 14/32, to 99 13/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.83 percent from 5.89 percent. The 30-year bond climbed 25/32, to 104 29/32. Its yield fell to 5.90 percent from 5.95 percent.</p>
