        <p>Democratic US Sen Charles S Robb, who faces difficult re-election fight in Virginia, tangles in back-to-back debates against Republican challenger former Gov George Allen, who leads by as much as 10 percentage points in some polls (S)</p>

        <p>Probably no Senate Democrat has a tougher re-election fight than Charles S. Robb of Virginia, who trails his Republican challenger, former Gov. George Allen, by up to 10 percentage points in some polls.</p>
        <p>In Richmond on Sunday, in the first of two debates, Mr. Robb said that Mr. Allen supported abortion restrictions and that his proposed $1,000-a-child tax credit for education expenses would not work as well as putting more money into schools.</p>

        <p>Probably no Senate Democrat has a tougher re-election fight than Charles S. Robb of Virginia, who trails his Republican challenger, former Gov. George Allen, by up to 10 percentage points in some polls.</p>
        <p>In Richmond on Sunday, in the first of two debates, Mr. Robb said that Mr. Allen supported abortion restrictions and that his proposed $1,000-a-child tax credit for education expenses would not work as well as putting more money into schools.</p>
        <p>Defending his education proposal, Mr. Allen said parents should have more say in how money is spent for education. As for abortion, he said he not only opposed it but also had a strong record of supporting laws restricting it.</p>
        <p>Education was also a major issue in the second debate yesterday in Tysons Corner. Mr. Allen said the tax credit would be the first bill he introduced if elected, The Associated Press reported.</p>
