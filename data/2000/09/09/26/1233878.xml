        <p>For the third time since the early 1980's, the New Jersey Supreme Court today took up the politically charged issue of parole for a 62-year-old prisoner who pistol-whipped and murdered two police officers in a nightclub in Lodi, N.J., in August 1963.</p>
        <p>The 90-minute hearing focused essentially on one question: was there a substantial likelihood that the prisoner, Thomas Trantino, would revert to crime if freed on parole?</p>

        <p>For the third time since the early 1980's, the New Jersey Supreme Court today took up the politically charged issue of parole for a 62-year-old prisoner who pistol-whipped and murdered two police officers in a nightclub in Lodi, N.J., in August 1963.</p>
        <p>The 90-minute hearing focused essentially on one question: was there a substantial likelihood that the prisoner, Thomas Trantino, would revert to crime if freed on parole?</p>
        <p>A deputy attorney general, Howard J. McCoach, answered yes, saying that beneath a charming demeanor, Mr. Trantino was a violence-prone manipulator with a ''borderline personality disorder'' and an inability to cope with stress and agitation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trantino's lawyer, Roger A. Lowenstein, contended that his client did not pose a risk. He said that Mr. Trantino had no infractions or impulsive mood swings during 37 years in prison.</p>
        <p>As his strongest evidence, Mr. Lowenstein cited a unanimous June ruling by a New Jersey appeals court that reversed the state parole board's refusal in November 1999 to free Mr. Trantino. The appeals court said the board did not have sufficient evidence that Mr. Trantino posed a substantial threat and, in a rare step for a court, ordered him released.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court set aside that order in early July and decided to review the case. Mr. Lowenstein appealed to the court today to uphold the June ruling. ''His liberty's being taken away from him based on no facts,'' he said of his client.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCoach, the deputy attorney general, said the lower court's ruling was flawed because, he argued, the courts can overturn a parole board decision only if the board has acted arbitrarily or abused its discretion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trantino has applied for parole, and lost, nine times since he first became eligible in 1980. In the early 1980's, the board approved his release on the condition that he pay financial restitution to the survivors of the two slain officers, Sgt. Peter Voto, 40, and Officer Gary Tedesco, 22. But the State Supreme Court set that decision aside in 1982, suggesting that Mr. Trantino had not been punished sufficiently.</p>
        <p>In a 1998 ruling, the court instructed the parole board to consider Mr. Trantino's risk of recidivism in its future reviews of his parole requests.</p>
        <p>Over the 20 years of the case, an anti-Trantino campaign started by the families of the murdered officers has won wide backing, including support from Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and many state legislators.</p>
        <p>In an indication of the case's impact on state government and the state judiciary, only three of the Supreme Court's seven justices conducted today's hearing. Four excused themselves without public explanation: Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz and Justices Peter G. Verniero and James R. Zazzali, all former attorneys general, and Jaynee LaVecchia, a former high-ranking official in the attorney general's office.</p>
        <p>Two judges from the appellate division of State Superior Court, James M. Havey and David S. Baime, were assigned to the case to provide the required quorum of five justices.</p>
