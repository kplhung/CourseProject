        <p>The first lesson at the gladiator school of the Roman Historical Society stressed discipline. ''You are slaves, and that is how I will treat you,'' Giuseppe Coluzzi, 32, barked at eight adults fidgeting in short white togas.</p>

        <p>The first lesson at the gladiator school of the Roman Historical Society stressed discipline. ''You are slaves, and that is how I will treat you,'' Giuseppe Coluzzi, 32, barked at eight adults fidgeting in short white togas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coluzzi, who uses the name ''Korakos'' in the arena, glared at them icily. Using the Latin phrase for ''Hail, teacher,'' he said, ''You will address me by saying 'Ave, magister,' and you will never use your swords outside the arena or without a magister present.''</p>
        <p>There were a few snickers, but mostly, the five men and three women who signed up last week to learn how to fight to the death listened raptly through two hours of gladiator history and combat theory (two points for a blow to the thorax).</p>
        <p>''I have always been a Roman history buff, but I want to relive it more intensely,'' Giuseppe Pecorelli, 51, an employee of a German multinational corporation, explained as he yearningly flexed his wooden practice sword. ''It is one thing to read histories or Roman poetry. I want to get in touch with my warrior side.''</p>
        <p>The Roman Historical Society, which has about 100 members, was founded in 1994, and is fittingly situated on the Via Appia Antica, the ancient Appian Way, the road where legend has it that St. Peter saw an apparition of Christ, and asked, ''Quo vadis, Domine?'' (''Whither goest thou, Lord?'')</p>
        <p>The society has a Web site (http://digilander.iol.it/sergioiac/), a clubhouse and a yard littered with helmets, shields, pikes, nets, catapults and other martial accessories.  The members devote most of their time to staging Roman scenes and battles for pageants and town fairs. But the society, which had long hoped to open a gladiator school, seized the coattails of the summer Hollywood hit, ''Gladiator,'' starring Russell Crowe, to begin offering classes this month.</p>
        <p>And these Roman history buffs, unlike many classicists in Italy and the United States, do not quibble with the liberties ''Gladiator'' screenwriters took in rewriting ancient Roman history.</p>
        <p>''The movie was excellent,'' Korakos stated defiantly. The trainer, whose day job has him printing Euro currency bills for the Bank of Italy, said he had seen ''Gladiator'' four times.</p>
        <p>But not all the new students, who paid $100 for a two-month course,  said they were drawn to gladiator school by the movie. Training for the female ''Amazon'' division, Patricia Mincone, 29, a hospital worker, said she would never be influenced by Hollywood.</p>
        <p>''I was looking for a workout that wasn't the typical routine -- tennis, aerobics, the things everybody does,'' she said. A tall woman with muscular arms and legs, Ms. Mincone looked as though she could easily stab, bludgeon or harpoon any of  her fellow rookies.</p>
        <p>But gladiator school does not sanction real bloodletting. Mostly, students are taught how to choreograph combat, (four sequences, six blows per sequence), both to savor simulated savagery and, eventually, to perform gladiator combat the way it was done in the Colosseum more than 2,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>Unlike American Civil War buffs who rigorously re-enact the Battle of Gettysburg or Manassas, Italians are not known for an obsession with dressing up and reliving past wars.  Italy's somewhat concise history of modern battlefield victories could be one reason.</p>
        <p>Another is that Italians already have a centuries-old tradition of religious re-enactments -- pageants and processions in which whole towns turn out to recreate favorite passages of the Bible or a saint's life. Every Easter since the 17th century, the city of Sezze, in central Italy, performs its Passion Play, a re-enactment of agonized journey to the cross on Good Friday. As many as 700 locals take part, playing roles as diverse as Mary, Pontius Pilate and vicious bare-chested Roman guards who whip chained Hebrew slaves as the procession moves through the streets.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, even religious pageants bring out the ancient brutality of some players, however. Several years ago, a few young amateur actors in Sezze got carried away and inadvertently flogged members of the audience. They were banished from future parades until last Easter, when Sezze brought its Good Friday procession to St. Peter's in Rome for the Holy Year.</p>
        <p>Gladiator school seems to appeal to Italians eager to rediscover their pagan roots. ''We are the descendants of the early Romans, so we of all people should explore our past,'' said Lia Cinque, 44, a homemaker who is married to Mr. Pecorelli. Sighing, she said their 24-year-old son was also a history buff, but in a spurt of filial rebellion, had joined a group whose members dress up as Scottish clan warriors.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cinque explained that she herself was not interested in gladiator training, and spent much of the lesson with her head buried in a historical novel set in antiquity, ''Neropolis'' by Hubert Monteilhet.</p>
        <p>A little like English history buffs who blame Shakespeare for blackening the reputation of Richard III, longtime members of the Roman Historical Society feel that Tacitus and others grossly misjudged Nero.</p>
        <p>Sergio Iacomoni, 47, who took the name Nero when he was elected president of the society, held court over the class in a full-length tunic embroidered with gold. Regally affable with the new recruits, he nevertheless took umbrage at the suggestion that his imperial role model was a bloodthirsty madman. ''Nero was nowhere near Rome when the fires started,'' he said sternly, referring to the legend that Nero fiddled as Rome burned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Iacomoni noted that many historians took a more revisionist view of Nero, but perhaps in a re-enactment of his predecessor's megalomania, he quickly added, ''Of course, I was the first, but now there are others who also defend Nero.''</p>
