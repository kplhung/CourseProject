        <p>Marion Lipschutz and Rose Rosenblatt clearly state their purpose at the beginning of their film ''Live Free or Die,'' which PBS is showing tonight as part of the series ''P.O.V.''

        <p>Marion Lipschutz and Rose Rosenblatt clearly state their purpose at the beginning of their film ''Live Free or Die,'' which PBS is showing tonight as part of the series ''P.O.V.'' These filmmakers wanted to produce a documentary about what they call ''the abortion provider crisis.'' What they needed, they say, was a hero: a doctor who endured protests and risked violence by performing abortions and was willing to be tailed by a film crew.</p>
        <p>The hero they found, Dr. Wayne Goldner of Bedford, N.H., could hardly have suited their purpose better if they had designed him themselves. Whatever you may think about abortion rights, or about this film's fervent support of them, you will probably come away from ''Live Free or Die'' convinced that Dr. Goldner is a person of courage and dedication.</p>
        <p>The same might be said about the people, and there are many on view here, who lock horns with Dr. Goldner. It might be said, but it never is. The film finds no hint of courage or dedication, and not even a shred of humanity, in those who reject abortion on religious grounds, who say they fear for students' sensibility or safety if Dr. Goldner continues giving sex education lectures at the local junior high school, who support the merger of his nonsectarian hospital with a Catholic one. (The film calls the merged hospital ''a Goliath,'' adding, ''Wayne was a remarkable David.'')</p>
        <p>By dismissing antiabortion activists, school board members and hospital officials as cuckoos or cowards (or both), the film diminishes Dr. Goldner's stature by simplifying his choices. Anyone can make an easy decision. It takes wisdom to make a complex one.</p>
        <p>Still, this engrossing film succeeds in stimulating thought about this polarizing issue. The strongest achievement of ''Live Free or Die'' (the ironic title is New Hampshire's state motto) is the portrait it paints of the hard-working, self-assured Dr. Goldner as well as his supportive wife and their three teenage children. The Goldners all clearly understand the world's harsh realities, especially after the killing of a doctor in Buffalo whose practice included abortions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldner -- who is shown delivering a baby at the hospital but not performing an abortion at his office -- frequently asks the family if he should retreat. ''It would be wrong,'' says his wife, Laura, her conviction overriding her obvious fear. At another point she tells the children, ''You have to see that what Daddy's doing is very meaningful to him.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldner himself can be eloquent, as when he explains how a vocal minority in the community can interfere with his offering a service that is protected by law: ''The tactic is to separate out the abortion provider in almost a hunting technique, to separate us out and isolate us from the rest of the herd.'' Doctors, above all, should rally around one of their own, he says, adding, ''You attack a physician, you're attacking all 500,000 of us.''</p>
        <p>The attackers in his case are a handful of protesters who picket Dr. Goldner's office once a week. Then they begin showing up at the junior high where, as a volunteer, he advocates abstinence and responsibility. ''Sex is never an emergency,'' he tells the students. ''You can always come back and do it some other time -- another year, another day.'' Not only do the picketers succeed in getting Dr. Goldner barred from teaching at the school, they demonstrate in front of his house and give out leaflets at his son's baseball games.</p>
        <p>But why do these people fight so tirelessly? The documentary doesn't say. It even suggests that it cannot find out.</p>
        <p>The filmmakers show the leader of the local antiabortion group running from an attempt to interview her. Then they say: ''When she did finally speak to us on the phone, she told us she didn't trust us or the media. Besides, she said, you're Jewish, Wayne's Jewish; how can I expect you to be fair?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lipschutz and Ms. Rosenblatt have no obligation to be fair, especially to people with whom they (and presumably most of their audience) disagree so vehemently. But by reducing Dr. Goldner's opponents to stick-figure villains, they undermine their own passionate argument.</p>
