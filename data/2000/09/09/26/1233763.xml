        <p>''More Chicken Soup and Other Folk Remedies,'' by Joan Wilen and Lydia Wilen (Ballantine Books, $14).</p>
        <p>Somewhere around the 16th century, the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus mixed mineral gold and salt and then let it ''digest'' in horse dung. When laced with wine, and drunk every day precisely at dawn, the elixir was supposed to cure all diseases of the mind and body. Blessedly, this entertaining little sequel to the Wilen sisters' earlier testimonial to folk remedies does not contain any Paracelsian cure-alls -- but some come awfully close.</p>
        <p>We learn that weak ankles may be strengthened by rubbing them with raw oysters until the bivalves disintegrate; that fruits beginning with the letter ''p'' are said to increase potency in men and enhance sexual energy in women; that tying a red string around one's waist may cure stomach-ache; that eating six raw almonds a day may improve memory; and that eating exactly nine gin-soaked raisins a day may relieve arthritis.</p>
        <p>Thought-provoking stuff, this, and not all of it related to health. There is an egg yolk shampoo (one yolk for thin and short, three for thick and long), exercises to cure stage-fright, a beer remedy for freckles, a way to keep rattlesnakes away by sleeping in a circle of lariat ropes, and a diet of sunflower seeds to ward off mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>It is fair to say, though, that not all the remedies offered are off the wall. Folk medicine has numerous modern spinoffs, palliatives that acknowledge the beneficial health effects of food components called phytochemicals, of fiber and a host of other substances found in vegetables, fruits, cereals and herbs. The resveratrol found in red wine, for example, has been shown to be a potent antioxidant, the lycopene in tomatoes may indeed lower the risk of prostate cancer, and the benefits of olive oil, broccoli and tofu do seem to work more wonders than a churchful of saints.</p>
        <p>To their credit, the authors cite (where they can, which is no easy task) research studies that indicate that hot chicken soup clears mucous particles from the nose, that vitamin E can reduce leg cramps, that raw carrots may lower cholesterol and that flaxseed may well become the favored nutritional food of the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Also, mindful that they may be accused of dispensing medical advice without benefit of a license, the good sisters know enough to salt their recipes and remedies with phrases like ''may help to,'' ''supposed to prevent,'' ''it just may'' and ''while it doesn't work for everyone.''</p>
        <p>All in all, the book is fun to read, and, like mother's chicken soup, it cannot hurt you and may even help. Still, the reader would do well to pay heed to the authors' comment after suggesting that eating two small beets in the morning may cure constipation: ''If, after trying these remedies, you still have a persisting problem, you should see a health professional.''</p>
