        <p>The husband of Marion Jones denied today that he had taken steroids and said that a mislabeled nutritional supplement was responsible for elevated levels of the performance-enhancing drug nandrolone in his system.</p>
        <p>The shot-putter C. J. Hunter tested positive for nandrolone at the Bislett Games in Oslo on July 28, officials of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, track and field's world governing body, said Monday. He withdrew from the Olympics before the Sydney Games after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery.</p>
        <p>Tears streaking down his face, his voice breaking, Hunter said at a news conference today that he would do nothing to embarrass Jones, or his children from a previous marriage. Jones is attempting to become the first female track and field athlete to win five gold medals in one Olympics.</p>
        <p>''This has been a very difficult past couple of days for C. J. and I,'' said Jones, who accompanied Hunter to the news conference but did not answer questions. Jones, who has already won the 100 meters, will compete in the 200, long jump, 4x100 relay and 4x400 relay by Saturday.</p>
        <p>''I am here to show my complete support for my husband,'' she said. ''I have total and complete respect, and believe the legal system will do what's needed to clear his name.''</p>
        <p>Hunter, and Victor Conte, executive director of Balco Laboratories in San Francisco and a nutritionist for some of the athletes competing in Sydney, said that Hunter had been using nutritional supplements, including an iron supplement, that has been found to contain nandrolone. Hunter said he was unaware that the supplements contained nandrolone, but would not identify them.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot data that strongly indicates C. J. was not using the anabolic steroid nandrolone,'' Conte said.</p>
        <p>Prince Alexandre de Merode, chief of the International Olympic Committee's medical commission, said that Hunter had failed three other drug tests this summer. Hunter said today that supplements were responsible for the other positive tests as well.</p>
        <p>Nandrolone has been easily detectable for years, and scientists have been puzzled why a rash of cases involving the steroid has surfaced in the past year. One possible reason is improperly labeled nutritional supplements, scientists said. A number of international track and field stars, such as Linford Christie of Britain, the 1992 Olympic champion at 100 meters, and Merlene Ottey of Jamaica, a sprinter who has won seven Olympic medals, have tested positive for the substance.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles lawyer Johnnie Cochran attended today's news conference, saying he was a friend of the family.</p>
        <p>''Track and field has been great to me, but there is nothing anyone could say or do or to get me to bring any kind of shame on the people I love,'' Hunter said. He won the 1999 world championship in the shot-put and said he planned to retire after the Sydney Games even before the positive drug tests.</p>
        <p>''I might be downright mean at times,'' Hunter said, ''but nobody on the planet can say I don't love my wife, don't love my kids. I have never in my life nor would I ever do anything to jeopardize their opinion of me.''</p>
        <p>He said he planned to defend himself vigorously, that he expected to be exonerated and that he would remain in Sydney to support Jones through her remaining events.</p>
        <p>''No one can stop that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Hunter said he told Jones about the positive test on Monday after reading and hearing news reports.</p>
        <p>He said he told her: ''I don't know what happened and I'm sorry. She knows I would never do anything to hurt her.''</p>
