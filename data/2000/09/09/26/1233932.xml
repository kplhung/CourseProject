        <p>Sun Microsystems in Palo Alto, Calif., has named two agencies to share its account, with billings estimated at $100 million. The two shops, which will work as a team, are the New York office of J. Walter Thompson, part of the WPP Group, and Tonic 360 in San Francisco, which has handled the Sun interactive assignment for the last two years.</p>
        <p>The bulk of the Sun account had been handled by the San Francisco office of Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide since April 1997. Sun and Lowe said on Sept. 11 that they would part ways because of what they described as a conflict arising last year after the merger that created Lowe Lintas; the merger brought together under one roof the accounts of Sun and a competitor, the Dell Computer Corporation.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a brief review between the San Francisco office of a Lowe Lintas sibling, the Martin Agency, and the Thompson-Tonic team.</p>
        <p>This is Sun's third time with Thompson. The company had worked with Thompson San Francisco from 1989 to 1991 and again from 1994 to 1997.</p>
        <p>Lowe Lintas and Martin are part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
