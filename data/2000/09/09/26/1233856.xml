        <p>Moving to resolve a custody battle over one of the oldest and most significant set of human remains ever found in North America, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced today that the bones of Kennewick Man belong to five American Indian tribes that claim him as an ancestor and wish to bury him.</p>
        <p>The bones, estimated to be 9,300 years old, were discovered four years ago in a mud bank of the Columbia River near Kennewick, Wash. They quickly became a source of archaeological contention after several scientists who initially examined the skeleton said its features were closer to people who once lived in Europe or Asia than to American Indians. It raised the possibility that Europeans or Asians lived in North America before many of the tribes.</p>
        <p>The tribes have sought to control the bones under a federal law, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, that requires skeletal remains to be turned over to people who can show a geographic or cultural affiliation with them.</p>
        <p>A group of scientists filed suit in Portland, Ore., seeking to block repatriation and saying that a treasure trove of information about the lives of ancient Americans would be lost if the bones were turned over to the Indians. That lawsuit could be resolved in the next year.</p>
        <p>In his decision today, Mr. Babbitt appeared to bypass the conclusions of a panel of scientists who were assigned by the court to determine the ethnic origins of Kennewick Man. That panel said the remains resembled those of people from Asia, particularly the Ainu of northern Japan, and Polynesians from southern Asia.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Babbitt said he based his decision on the Indian grave repatriation law. He said the tribes were able to demonstrate some cultural affiliation with the bones.</p>
        <p>''Although ambiguities in the data made this a close call, I was persuaded by the geographic data and oral histories of the five tribes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He also said the tribes were able to demonstrate that the land where the bones were found had been an aboriginal home for the five tribes seeking Kennewick Man. ''These tribes,'' he said, ''have inhabited, hunted and fished this area around the confluence of the Columbia and Snake Rivers for millennia.''</p>
        <p>''It's a tremendous victory -- a big win,'' said Armand Minthorn, a member of the governing board of the Umatilla Nation, one of five tribes claiming the bones. ''It just can't be expressed how much this means to us culturally.''</p>
        <p>The bones are being held in the Burke Museum in Seattle, where they are likely to remain until the litigation is over. But if Mr. Babbitt's decision is upheld by the courts, Kennewick Man would be given a proper burial as a sacred ancestor, Mr. Minthorn said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt's decision was criticized by some of the scientists who want to continue studying the bones.</p>
        <p>''If they would have allowed us to study the skeleton when they first discovered it, this thing would be over by now,'' said Alan Schneider, a lawyer for the scientists who are suing for access to the bones.</p>
        <p>Since Kennewick Man was discovered, the bones have obtained icon status by some self-professed Pagan groups who said the discovery was evidence of early European habitation in the United States.</p>
        <p>Several political leaders in the Northwest said the case showed the need to change the Indian graves act, which they called too broad.</p>
        <p>Although they were never able to place the bones with any one ethnic group, the scientists traced them to Asian and Pacific Islander groups with a long maritime heritage, bolstering the case that some of the first Americans may have come by boat, crossing the Pacific or following islands north of Japan to the Bering Sea and then down the West Coast.</p>
