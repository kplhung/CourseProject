        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton said yesterday that she would continue to help raise soft money for the Democratic Party even though she had agreed with Representative Rick A. Lazio not to allow advertisements in their New York Senate race paid for with the largely unregulated money.</p>
        <p>Answering questions at a news conference in Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton said that she had helped raise money over the years for Democratic candidates and that she would continue to do so because ''I believe in the Democratic Party.''</p>
        <p>She said that she had promised the party that she would participate in additional fund-raising activities before the election on Nov. 7 -- a pledge, she said, not affected by her deal with Mr. Lazio to ban the use of soft money in their television and radio advertising. Campaign officials said Mrs. Clinton would be out of the state on Thursday and Friday  raising money.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to fulfill my remaining obligations to the Democratic Party in the coming weeks, to fulfill the commitments I have made to help raise money they believe is important in using in other races,'' Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said that she would have no say in how the soft money she raised would be spent.</p>
        <p>''That is not my money,'' she said. ''It is the money of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, still buoyant after pressing Mrs. Clinton to accept the restrictions on soft-money advertising, tried to keep the issue alive by appearing at Battery Park with Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has been a leader of campaign finance reform in Congress. Mr. McCain, standing beside Mr. Lazio at the Navy war memorial with the Statue of Liberty in the distance behind them, congratulated both candidates on the deal and urged all campaigns for federal office to follow suit.</p>
        <p>''This should be an example for all campaigns in America,'' Mr. McCain said, ''and it's an important step in getting rid of the evil and pernicious and corrupting influence of the so-called soft money.''</p>
        <p>But Senator McCain suggested that the deal came just in time because several groups were prepared to begin raising and spending soft money on behalf of Mr. Lazio, who has not raised any on his own soft money. ''I know that there were people who were prepared to give unlimited amounts of money to the Lazio campaign, because I've talked to them,'' Mr. McCain said.</p>
        <p>Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, said he did not know which groups Mr. McCain was referring to, adding that the congressman was not raising soft money.</p>
        <p>The deal struck between the two candidates remained fragile, however, and Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, described it yesterday as tenuous. He wrote a letter to the Conservative Leadership PAC, a supporter, to persuade the group to abide by the agreement. Other independent groups, like the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, are meeting this week to decide whether to comply.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton had tried to steer the day's news away from the debate over soft-money spending and toward more friendly ground. She had called the news conference to criticize the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, for ''sowing the seeds of future hatred.'' The questions about soft money came only after she issued a strong rebuke of Mr. Arafat for not removing anti-Semitic references in Palestinian schoolbooks.</p>
        <p>Later in the day, Mrs. Clinton visited the Margaret Tietz Center for Nursing Care in Jamaica, Queens, where about half of the residents are Holocaust survivors. She was joined by Representative Tom Lantos, a California Democrat and Holocaust survivor, who used the opportunity to cast Mr. Lazio as a right-wing Republican trying to persuade New Yorkers he is moderate.</p>
