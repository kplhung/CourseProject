        <p>PHILIPPINES: THOUSANDS FLEE ASSAULT -- More than 36,000 villagers of Jolo Island in the southern Philippines have fled their homes to escape a military assault on Muslim rebels holding 17 hostages, military officials said. Troops were reported to be still seeking the hostages -- 10 days after the assault began and the Abu Sayyaf rebels fled. There were persistent reports of civilian casualties in the attack, which involved 4,000 troops. But the military insisted that only two civilians had been killed. Independent verification was not possible; the military has blocked access to many areas.</p>

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: DROUGHT AND CHOLERA -- More than 90 people have died in a cholera outbreak in Badghis, a drought-affected northwestern Afghan province. At least 20,000 Afghans need emergency health aid, the United Nations office in Kabul said. The drought, the worst in three decades, has caused dozens of other deaths across southwestern Asia, from Iran to Pakistan, as livestock and crops die and fresh water is not available for drinking and cooking.</p>

        <p>INDIA: PROTEST ON IRAQ -- India applauded French and Russian flights to Iraq challenging an international air embargo and said it was considering its own protest flight to Baghdad. The official Iraqi news agency said Ajit Kumar Panja, India's deputy minister of state for foreign affairs, signed a broad cooperation accord on a visit to Baghdad, where he also denounced sanctions and American and British patrols in Iraq's no flight zones.</p>

        <p>CUBA: ANGER AT U.S. ON ASYLUM -- Reacting to the United States decision last week to give asylum to nine Cuban defectors, Fidel Castro and thousands of protesters converged on a Havana plaza in front of the American diplomatic offices. The nine fled in a small plane that crashed into the sea. Cuba has portrayed the incident as a hijacking, and accused Washington of encouraging ''air piracy'' by protecting those who ''break not only Cuban but also international law.''</p>

        <p>CANADA: QUEBEC SEPARATIST ATTACK -- A radical Quebec separatist group, the French Language Self-Defense Brigade, has claimed responsibility for firebombing a Montreal church, St. Nicholas Antiochian Orthodox Church, that an English language rights group, Alliance Quebec, was to have used for a fund-raising event. The police say that this year the group has been behind five firebombings and many other acts of vandalism against businesses with English-sounding names like Le Bargain Shop.</p>

        <p>CANADA: 'IMPLAUSIBLE' ABUSE CLAIMS Hundreds of former students at a Nova Scotia detention school may have defrauded the province of millions with false claims of physical and sexual abuse, a provincial report indicates. During the last five years, the province paid $25 million to 1,237 supposed victims. ''Most of the allegations are either unsustainable or implausible,'' concluded the review of the payout program for Shelburne School for Boys. Noting that most claims were made after a compensation program was announced, the report asserted, ''Many of the statements appear to be concocted.''</p>

        <p>CHILE: PINOCHET INQUIRY POSTPONED -- Juan Guzman, the Chilean judge reviewing lawsuits charging rights abuses by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, postponed a scheduled Oct. 9 interrogation of the general for a month and ordered him to undergo medical tests.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>GERMANY: ART RESTITUTION -- -- At a Berlin ceremony, two German museums returned more than 80 artworks to the heirs of a Leipzig-based Jewish publisher, Gustav Kirstein, decades after they first sought compensation for a collection seized by the Nazis. Officials from the western city of Hanover handed over a Lovis Corinth oil painting valued as high as $470,000, while the eastern city of Leipzig returned more than 80 works, mostly drawings and prints by Max Klinger. Embarrassed by stories like that of the Kirstein heirs, whose request for compensation was rejected in 1964, Germany has urged museums to comb their collections for looted art and publish the details to encourage new claims.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: JERUSALEM LAW An Israeli Parliament committee approved a law that would require an absolute majority of 61 lawmakers to endorse a decision to turn over land within the present municipal borders of Jerusalem to ''a foreign body.'' If the full Parliament passes the law, it will be very hard for an Israeli prime minister to win approval for a peace agreement that involves dividing Jerusalem.</p>

        <p>SAUDI ARABIA, YEMEN: FEVER ALERT -- Saudi Arabia has closed its borders with Yemen to prevent the spread of Rift Valley fever, which has left dozens dead and hundreds ill in both countries, a Saudi official said. It is the first time that the disease, which affects domestic animals and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, has been known to strike outside Africa. Symptoms include hemorrhagic fever and eye problems, although human deaths are said to be rare. South African experts have arrived in Saudi Arabia, while teams from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control are in Yemen.</p>

        <p>IVORY COAST: TALKS ON ELECTION -- Ivory Coast's ruler, Gen. Robert Guei, headed into talks in Abidjan with seven African presidents trying to defuse a political crisis before the presidential election next month. Sources said the leaders would ask General Guei, who rose to power in a December coup, to quit the race. The talks took place a day after the general snubbed a similar meeting with leaders from 10 Organization of African Unity nations in Lome, Togo.</p>
