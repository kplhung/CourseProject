      <abstract>
        <p>Researchers at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, say they have found another possible cause of sinusitis: overly aggressive immune reaction to fungi in the nose (M)</p>

        <p>Scientists long thought that sinusitis, the most common long-term disease in the United States,  was caused by allergies or by bacteria trapped inside the labyrinthine sinuses.

        <p>Scientists long thought that sinusitis, the most common long-term disease in the United States,  was caused by allergies or by bacteria trapped inside the labyrinthine sinuses. And over the years, doctors have tried a variety of treatments, as drastic as surgery, for chronic coldlike symptoms with limited success.</p>
        <p>Then last year, researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., reported that they had found another possible cause: an overly aggressive immune reaction to fungi in the nose. ''It is a total shift of the paradigm,'' said Dr. Jens Ponikau, one of the Mayo researchers.</p>
        <p>With new laboratory techniques, scientists have compiled a much clearer picture of the organisms that grow in noses and sinuses, and the pictures show that fungi are more prevalent than previously believed. In addition, the researchers came up with a possible mechanism through which the body's reaction to fungi causes the inflammation that fosters sinusitis in some people.</p>
        <p>The finding, if true, suggests the need for a different approach, aimed at killing the fungi. The antihistamines that tamp down an allergic person's response to a nose full of cat dander, pollen or dust mites appear to have no effect on the stuffiness caused by the fungi.</p>
        <p>At a rhinology conference on Friday in Washington, the researchers reported that they had tried a new treatment aimed at the fungi. Dr. David Sherris, who conducted the yearlong experiment, gave 51 patients with chronic sinus inflammation an antifungal drug spray. Thirty-eight, or 75 percent, reported a reduction in symptoms, which researchers confirmed by visual examination.</p>
        <p>The research, Dr. Sherris said, suggests that the antifungal drugs may eliminate the need for steroids. Sixteen of the patients who reported improvement were taking steroids for the disease, and 13 of them were able to reduce their dose or do without the drugs entirely.</p>
        <p>The Mayo results have not been subjected to the most rigorous test, a double-blind clinical study, although one is planned for this year.</p>
        <p>Still, some experts at the conference  were skeptical. ''This isn't a magic wand just yet, but it's a hopeful sign,'' said Dr. Jordan Josephson, a Manhattan otolaryngologist.</p>
        <p>Dr. Josephson likened the findings to the discovery some years ago that bacteria, not diet or stress, caused stomach ulcers. ''People thought that was crazy, too, but it turned out to be true,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. David Kennedy, a professor of otolaryngology at the University of Pennsylvania, also counseled caution. Chronic sinusitis, he said, is caused by a variety of factors, including viruses, pollution, stress and genetic disorders that make the sinuses function improperly.</p>
        <p>The Mayo researchers do not disagree. They say their study is applicable to many cases, not all. ''We're not declaring victory just yet,'' Dr. Sherris said.</p>
        <p>Doctors had searched tissue samples from surgery for clues to the disease, but the Mayo team began to examine nasal mucus to see if it contained anything that was swelling the sinuses. ''The enemy is in the mucus, not the tissue,'' Dr. Ponikau said. ''We weren't watching the movie till the end.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Ponikau described the process this way: When confronted with fungi, the bodies of chronic sinusitis sufferers dispatch white blood cells called eosinophils. They leave the bloodstream and cross into the mucus to destroy the invader. In doing so, they release a toxic protein that irritates the delicate lining of the sinuses, making them susceptible to bacterial infections.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sherris said that while the presence of fungi was nearly universal, only people who were sensitive to them experienced the immune reaction. He compared the reaction to a ragweed allergy. Everyone breathes in the same amount of ragweed pollen, but only those who are sensitive to it develop symptoms.</p>
        <p>New laboratory techniques have helped make the connection between fungi and sinusitis clearer, the researchers said. Researchers in Rochester and in Graz, Austria, found dozens of species of fungi growing in the noses of both patients and healthy people. Dr. Walter Buzina, a microbiologist in Graz, actually grew mushrooms from the fungi he found in the subjects' noses. Slides of his petri dishes showed molds commonly found in bread bags or under logs.</p>
        <p>A 1994 Harvard study showed that chronic sinusitis, which afflicts about 40 million Americans, costs about $2.4 billion a year. The disease's impact is also growing: from 1990-1992, federal statistics show, it caused 73 million lost workdays, up from 50 million in 1986-1988.</p>
