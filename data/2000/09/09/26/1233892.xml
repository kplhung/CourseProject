        <p>Opposition Candidate Claims to Defeat Milosevic  Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition candidate in the Yugoslav presidential election, claimed victory over President Slobodan Milosevic in the elections Sunday. Mr. Kostunica's supporters said their tally showed him well on his way to a first-round victory. But Mr. Milosevic's ruling coalition said the president was ahead, though the government suspended vote counting; the legal deadline for announcing results is Thursday, and the opposition is concerned about Mr. Milosevic's willingness to acknowledge defeat.</p>

        <p>A Verdict on Bosnia  A federal jury in Manhattan ordered the Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic to pay $4.5 billion to victims of rape, torture and genocide in the Bosnian war. Even though Dr. Karadzic is at large and the award may never be collected, the jury foreman said he and other members of the jury felt the need to express their outrage over the abuses.</p>

        <p>Barak Is Host to Arafat  Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, met for the first time since the Camp David peace talks ended two months ago. Officials on both sides do not expect that the deadlock in the peace negotiations will be broken, but see the meeting, in Mr. Barak's home, as progress in itself.</p>

        <p>U.S. Defends Action in Peru  American officials defended their role in pressuring Panama to give refuge to Valdimiro Montesinos, Peru's ousted intelligence chief, asserting that his departure was necessary to avoid a military coup. Human rights groups criticized the United States for seeking to arrange a soft landing for Mr. Montesinos outside of Peru, where it could be more difficult to prosecute him for abuses.</p>

        <p>New Player in French Scandal  Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a former Socialist cabinet official in France, acknowledged that he was given a copy of a videotape that accuses President Jacques Chirac of illegal activities, but that he did not notify the authorities during the two years he had it. Mr. Chirac, who denies the accusations made on the tape, called for an investigation into how Mr. Strauss-Kahn had obtained it.</p>

        <p>Senate Approves Measure To Restore Everglades  The Senate voted overwhelmingly to approve a $7.8 billion plan to restore the Everglades and its ecosystem, a project supporters say is the most ambitious environmental restoration effort ever. The plan, drafted by the Army Corps of Engineers, will revamp South Florida's water supply by capturing and storing more rainwater, then redirecting its flow into the Everglades. The House has not set a vote for the bill.</p>

        <p>Removal of Barricades Urged  Mayor Anthony A. Williams of the District of Columbia, backed by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Eleanor Holmes Norton, the city's nonvoting Congressional delegate, urged the reopening of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. It was closed after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. The Secret Service is cool to the proposal.</p>

        <p>Determining Drunken Driving  A dispute in Congress over setting a national standard for what constitutes drunken driving is delaying a transportation spending bill. Advocates of a tougher standard want all states to adopt a blood alcohol level of 0.08, which a 170-pound man would expect to have after drinking five beers in two hours; 30 states currently use 0.10 as the level, which allows that man to drink six beers.</p>

        <p>Bill on Cruise Ship Dumping  Congress is close to passing legislation that the Justice Department says will legalize cruise ships' dumping of some toxic chemicals. But the measure's Senate sponsor, Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, says it will protect the environment by putting new limits on where ships can dump wastewater in Alaska.</p>

        <p>Lieberman and His Senate Seat  Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their regaining control of the Senate this fall, prompting a growing number to pressure Senator Joseph I. Lieberman to let another Connecticut Democrat seek his seat so that his party will not lose it if he becomes vice president.</p>

        <p>Gore on Medicare H.M.O.'s  Vice President Al Gore pledged to strengthen sanctions against H.M.O.'s that pull out of the Medicare market and to eliminate Medicare co-payments and deductibles for various preventative tests.</p>

        <p>Judge Dismisses Suit Over Pollution of Hudson  A state judge in Albany has dismissed as ''premature'' and ''meritless'' a lawsuit filed last year by State Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer against General Electric that asserted that the company should be held liable for the economic costs of pollution in the Hudson River.</p>

        <p>Terror Suspect Asserts Abuse  Lawyers for Wadih el-Hage, a suspect in the bombing of two American embassies, say prosecutors are using a ''pattern of coercion and intimidation'' against potential defense witnesses through improper use of the grand jury and other tactics.</p>

        <p>Drug Making a Comeback  A small privately held Canadian company, Duchesnay, is working with the F.D.A. to gain permission to market a generic version of Bendectin, the morning sickness drug removed from the market in 1983 in a barrage of lawsuits claiming that it caused birth defects. The company says -- and medical experts agree -- that studies have failed to find that Bendectin poses any dangers.</p>

        <p>New Approach to Treating M.S.  Researchers said the onset of multiple sclerosis could be delayed, and its severity reduced, by treatment for neurological problems thought to be very early signs of the disease. The treatment involves weekly injections of Avonex, or interferon beta-1a.</p>

        <p>U.S. Backs Indians on Bones  Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said Kennewick Man, 9,300-year-old bones that scientists said appeared not to be of Native American ancestry, should be given to five American Indian tribes. But the bones are unlikely to be handed over until a suit filed by scientists is resolved.</p>

        <p>Oil Prices Ebb  The prices of crude and home heating oil fell in the wake of the Clinton administration's decision to release 30 million barrels of oil from the nation's emergency reserve. But home heating oil and gasoline prices remained near 10-year highs.</p>

        <p>Still No Life in Euro  The markets barely reacted on the first full business day after major central banks intervened in the currency markets to revive the downtrodden European common currency. The euro closed at 87.30 cents in late New York trading, compared with 87.87 late Friday</p>

        <p>Abductions and Tax Breaks  The I.R.S. reversed a decision that had denied a tax break to the parents of a kidnapped child in the years after the child's abduction. The agency had drawn criticism from Congress for its initial decision.</p>

        <p>Seeking an AT&amp;T Meeting  The comptrollers of the State and City of New York, representing pension funds for public employees that are among the largest shareholders in AT&amp;T, have requested a meeting with its chairman to discuss the company's long-term prospects. The officials expressed concern over AT&amp;T's sagging share price and strategies that management is considering to improve its fortunes.</p>
