        <p>Remarks from a speech on Medicare policy yesterday in St. Petersburg, Fla.:</p>
        <p>''There is a real debate in this election over the future of Medicare. And I think it's an important debate. The other side has called Medicare a 'government H.M.O.' They really never have liked it. They've suggested that you shouldn't trust Medicare to provide prescription drug coverage. Let me tell you: Medicare has been a lifeline for tens of millions of families. It's given millions the choice of doctors and health plans so they don't have to choose between health care and food and rent. So I'll take Medicare over the real H.M.O.'s any day of the week.</p>

        <p>''The other side seems to put a lot of trust in those H.M.O.s. And that's simply an area where we disagree. Their plan would force seniors into H.M.O.'s. And their plan would make seniors go beg the H.M.O.'s and insurance companies for prescription drug coverage, even if the H.M.O.'s don't want to provide it. If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will block any effort to turn Medicare over to the H.M.O.'s.''</p>
