        <p>More companies are offering health insurance benefits to partners of gay and lesbian employees than ever before, including more than 100 of the Fortune 500 companies, a new study has found.</p>
        <p>As of August, 3,572 companies, colleges, universities, states and local governments were offering or had announced that they would offer health insurance coverage to domestic partners of their employees -- an increase of 25 percent from last year, the study found. In August 1999, 2,856 of these companies, educational institutions and governments offered such benefits.</p>
        <p>Sixty-five percent of those in the survey provide domestic partner benefits to same-sex and opposite-sex couples; 35 percent offer benefits only to same-sex couples, the study found.</p>
        <p>The study was conducted by the Human Rights Campaign, a Washington-based group that represents gay, lesbian and transgender Americans.</p>
        <p>''Employers have discovered that these benefits help attract and keep the best workers, a critical consideration in the current tight job market,'' said Kim I. Mills, education director for the Human Rights Campaign and an editor of the report.</p>
        <p>Among Fortune 500 companies, the number of employers offering benefits to domestic partners increased 46 percent, the study found, to 102 this year from 70 in 1999.</p>
        <p>The Big Three automakers -- DaimlerChrysler,, General Motors and Ford Motor -- announced in June that they would offer health benefits to the same-sex partners of their 466,000 hourly and salaried employees in the United States. This was a ''landmark move'' in the effort by corporate America to provide such benefits for gay and lesbian couples, the report concluded.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola also announced in June that it would extend health coverage to domestic partners, joining General Mills and Pillsbury, two other leading food producers that offer these benefits.</p>
        <p>Boeing decided last October that it would offer health coverage to nonunion members and their partners. Honeywell, another leading aerospace company, provides benefits to domestic partners.</p>
        <p>Until this year, the two largest American companies offering same-sex benefits had been I.B.M. and Citigroup, Ms. Mills said. Both companies are based in the New York area, where gays and lesbians are more politically and economically influential than in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>''There is a cultural shift taking place,'' Ms. Mills said. ''People want to be open about their lives in the workplace. The public attitude is that this kind of discrimination is wrong.''</p>
        <p>In May 1998, President Clinton issued an executive order prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian work force. To date, all cabinet-level departments and 24 independent agencies have adopted nondiscrimination policies with regard to sexual orientation. But the federal government does not provide same-sex benefits for its employees.</p>
        <p>Ninety state and local governments or government agencies, however, provide domestic-partner health benefits, the report showed. Since August 1999, Connecticut and Washington have added benefits for state workers, joining California, New York, Vermont and Oregon. In addition, 12 cities and counties have added or announced that they would begin to offer these benefits, including Atlanta; Phoenix; Montgomery County, Md.; and Albuquerque.</p>
