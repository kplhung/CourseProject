        <p>With each successive day bringing more disappointing ratings for his taped Summer Olympic production, Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, said he had not demanded that schedules be altered to let the network carry track and field live in prime time.</p>
        <p>''Since 1995, before we bought the rights, we knew there would be no adjustments because Australia felt these Olympics would be for the 19 million Australians to go home to watch in prime time,'' Ebersol said today.

        <p>With each successive day bringing more disappointing ratings for his taped Summer Olympic production, Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, said he had not demanded that schedules be altered to let the network carry track and field live in prime time.</p>
        <p>''Since 1995, before we bought the rights, we knew there would be no adjustments because Australia felt these Olympics would be for the 19 million Australians to go home to watch in prime time,'' Ebersol said today. ''They've always been the ones who've watched the Olympics in the morning or the middle of the night.''</p>
        <p>Ebersol insisted that he would have gotten nowhere if he had demanded changes because NBC's $705 million rights fee represents the single largest investment by an Olympic broadcaster or sponsor.</p>
        <p>Playing the network Bigfoot wouldn't have worked had he approached the International Amateur Athletic Federation when NBC's first few days' ratings were foundering. The federation controls the Olympic track and field schedule, and scheduled the best races to coincide with prime time for the Australian Seven Network.</p>
        <p>''This country invested $10 billion into these Games, which makes $705 million look small,'' Ebersol said. ''We had absolutely no flexibility in our contract.''</p>
        <p>Any hasty changes to the second week's track and field schedule would have created havoc for ticket-holders. To move an event that was shown live at 8 p.m. in Sydney into prime time for NBC would have required moving it at least six hours earlier to be seen at 11 p.m. Eastern time, which is 15 hours behind Sydney.</p>
        <p>''We didn't change anything for any networks,'' said Giorgio Renieri, a federation spokesman. ''There's been no request from NBC, and we wouldn't change anything. We've changed the schedule for competitive reasons, but not for television reasons.''</p>
        <p>Through nine days of swimming, gymnastics and the start of track and field, NBC's 14.6 prime-time Nielsen rating is 9.3 percent below its guarantee to advertisers of a 16.1 rating, which has caused the network to provide free commercial time to its advertisers.</p>
        <p>The Summer Olympics rating is down 35 percent from the 1996 Atlanta Games, 22 percent from the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Spain, and 18 percent from the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea.</p>
        <p>The ninth day of the Olympics produced a 13.5 rating, on a Saturday night that included Michael Johnson's 400-meter quarterfinal race. Each rating point equals 1.01 million television households.</p>
        <p>Ebersol continues to believe that the ratings are down because economics forced NBC to expand to a 7 p.m. to midnight Eastern schedule, and miscalculated the impact of Olympic Games played in September, when viewers have less available time than in the summer. He is less certain of the magnitude of the Internet's impact.</p>
        <p>Ebersol continues to be bitter at the news media's comparison of NBC's taped broadcasts with the Canadian Broadcasting Company's live predawn telecasts.</p>
        <p>''We compete with the CBC in Seattle,'' he said. ''In prime time, we're averaging a 20 rating there, and for the same events in the early morning, it's getting a 0.6. I don't gain anything by criticizing CBC, but the idea that every four years, people write about the CBC and don't follow up with its business results, which are a disaster. When 100,000 people out of 32 million people watch, it's a disaster. It's just a fixation by editors, who are playing some game.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Actually, I love the whole CBC thing. I find it so stupid.''</p>
