        <p>For years, Thomas K. Brown threw verbal darts in a profession known for cozy collegiality. A top-rated stock analyst, he frequently blasted top bankers who were stringing together mergers at prices he believed were too high.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown so irritated Edward Crutchfield Jr., the former chief executive of the First Union Corporation -- he once said Mr. Crutchfield ''never saw an acquisition proposal he didn't like'' -- that Mr. Crutchfield dismissed the freckle-faced Mr. Brown as ''that little red-haired boy.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Brown even sent Hugh L. McColl Jr., who was gobbling up companies as the chief executive of NationsBank, a business card embossed with a quote from Warren E. Buffett about the ''egregious imbalance'' of acquisitions, namely their usually negative impact on the stock of the acquiring company. The flip side of the card said simply, ''Compliments of Thomas K. Brown.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McColl, now chief executive of Bank of America, wrote back that he found the note ''arrogant and insulting.''</p>
        <p>''I do not work for you, and don't plan to,'' Mr. McColl added. ''Please remove me from your mailing list.''</p>
        <p>No such luck. Though Mr. Brown, 41, has moved from one buttoned-down profession to another, his bombs are still trained on Mr. McColl. Earlier this year, he opened an investment firm, Second Curve Capital, started a hedge fund for wealthy investors and began posting his barbs on a Web site he created called Bankstocks.com.</p>
        <p>Even though the hedge fund industry is the most secretive and private part of the investment world, Mr. Brown's Web site is an unfettered forum for his sharp-edged analysis.</p>
        <p>Sometimes it is kind, sometimes it cruel. Earlier this year, Mr. Brown wrote a positive review of Bank One's hiring of James L. Dimon, a former Citigroup executive, as its new chief. Mr. Brown praised Mr. Dimon as ''Mr. Right'' and said he was a charismatic outsider who could address the company's internal divisions and who had the backing of Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown's favorite target, however, remains Mr. McColl, a 65-year-old take-charge ex-Marine from North Carolina who keeps a hand grenade on his desk, but who is also known for his progressive streak, including his extension of Bank of America health benefits to same-sex partners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown has attacked Mr. McColl over last year's $48.5 million pay package, and options on 1.4 million shares, compensation Mr. Brown called ''truly nauseating'' since the company's stock was falling. He even posted an invitation on the site to Bank of America's outside directors, promising to ''travel to any location at any time'' to explain why Mr. McColl and the firm's senior management should be ousted.</p>
        <p>What does Mr. McColl think of all this? He declined to comment, but Bank of America issued the following statement:</p>
        <p>''While we respect the role of stock analysts in expressing their opinion about a company's financial prospects, we are puzzled by Mr. Brown's approach, which more nearly resembles personal attacks than financial analysis.''</p>
        <p>Much of Mr. Brown's criticism of Mr. McColl is directed at his acquisition strategies. As chief executive of NationsBank, Mr. McColl was an aggressive buyer, purchasing BankSouth in 1995, Boatmen's Bancshares in 1996 and Montgomery Securities in 1997. His acquisitions culminated in 1998, when NationsBank merged with -- and eventually took the name of -- Bank of America.</p>
        <p>''He has always confused size with winning,'' Mr. Brown wrote in a recent commentary, entitled ''McColl's Latest Outrageous Comments,'' that offered a point-by-point refutation of an interview with Mr. McColl that appeared in U.S. Banker magazine.</p>
        <p>''Shareholders don't care about owning the biggest bank,'' he added. ''They want to own shares in the banking company that is going to provide them with the best risk-adjusted return on their capital.''</p>
        <p>After falling 16.5 percent last year, Bank of America's stock has rebounded with almost a 9.5 percent gain this year, through yesterday. But it lags the 12.3 percent return of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange/ KBW Bank index. Still, there are certainly analysts who disagree with Mr. Brown's assessment.</p>
        <p>''There's been some concerns because McColl has done so many mergers and he is thought of, along with Crutchfield, as one of the two big serial acquirers of the industry,'' said James Ellman, a Bank of America investor who manages the $80 million Merrill Lynch Global Financial Services fund, and a $200 million offshore fund.</p>
        <p>''But NationsBank was a very good investment for a long time and so was Bank of America for the last few years,'' he added. ''You've got two management teams who have shown the ability to create shareholder value.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown has also come up with an unusual analytical approach -- he is inviting Bank of America employees, past and present, to write to his Web site with ''what you believe are the best and worst practices at the company.'' Bankstocks.com has received over 100 replies since posting the request in June, some from Bank of America e-mail addresses, the firm said. It counts more than 1,000 unique visitors a day.</p>
        <p>Bankstocks.com provided three replies to The New York Times -- the Web site does not post replies for all to see. One e-mail message came from someone who identified himself as a former manager at Bank of America and said the company's top-tier management insulated itself from many executives and alienated managers not in this select circle.</p>
        <p>Another e-mailer, identified as a shareholder and a former executive of a competing bank, complained about the long lines at Bank of America branches. A third e-mail, dealing with the company's technology infrastructure, was from someone who said he had recently left Bank of America for a competitor.</p>
        <p>''They are way behind on core systems, despite having invested heavily, and B of A was worse,'' the correspondent wrote. ''Now, you put the two together, and voila, a mess.''</p>
        <p>Can one believe the veracity of these any more than postings on a message board? Bankstocks.com has no formal verification process, but it has started dialogues with some of the executives and employees who write in. Bankstocks.com also says the e-mail messages it gets, because they are usually from people in the industry, generally have a level of specificity one does not find on a message board.</p>
        <p>''We get stories,'' said Stephen D. Krug, chief operating officer of Second Curve Capital and a former Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette junior analyst. ''They're not message board postings.''</p>
        <p>''It's not like this is our only input,'' he added. ''We know well enough what Bank of America is doing by talking to other banks and financial institutions. When e-mails come in, we look at the specifics they discuss, the names they use, the context.''</p>
        <p>In his new role as a money manager, of course, Mr. Brown is not unbiased. He writes about companies in which his firm has a stake -- whether as a buyer of its stock or as a short-seller trying to profit by betting a stock price will fall. Each commentary he writes comes with a disclaimer to that effect. Mr. Brown's firm declined to say whether it was long or short on Bank of America. Certainly, his approach has raised eyebrows in the world of hedge funds.</p>
        <p>''I never heard anybody say they cared about what he thought,'' said one hedge fund manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''I just don't put any merit one way or the other on what he says.''</p>
        <p>A money manager at a second hedge fund, also speaking on condition of anonymity, disagreed.</p>
        <p>''Tom's an excellent analyst, very opinionated,'' the manager said of Bankstocks.com. ''Some people despise Tom, and other people think he's sharp. In many cases, it's important to the stock and its shareholders that someone is out there pointing out management's missteps.''</p>
        <p>Barry Colvin, chief operating officer of Tremont Advisors, a hedge fund consulting firm, said Mr. Brown was likely to remain a lonely voice.</p>
        <p>''It might be interesting in terms of publicity, but it's a short-term gain potentially sacrificing long-term access,'' Mr. Colvin said. ''Not only are you cutting yourself off from Bank of America -- they'll never talk to you again -- but it also scares off other management.''</p>
        <p>Bank of America said it would continue to grant Mr. Brown access to the company. ''He has been an active participant in analyst calls and we anticipate continuing to provide him access,'' the bank said in its statement.</p>
        <p>Still, it is no surprise that relations are strained. Mr. Brown says he now has freedom that he never had when he led a team of banking analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Most Wall Street analysts walk a tightrope between offering unvarnished opinions and being careful not to rankle potential investment banking clients.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said he was fired in 1998 because Donaldson ran out of patience with his criticisms of large bank mergers, even though he had been named the top regional bank analyst by Institutional Investor magazine for eight of nine years. A Donaldson spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Brown's departure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown does not see his Web site as a journalistic enterprise, in the mold of TheStreet.com, the financial Web site co-founded by James J. Cramer, another outspoken hedge fund manager. He sees it as a research tool.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said his firm had spent no money to advertise and had no intention of using the site as a commercial enterprise. Rather than becoming a chat board for retail investors, he hoped Bankstocks.com would become a forum for employees.</p>
        <p>''We brought up the site in January and didn't know what was going to happen,'' he said. ''What we were surprised by is the interactivity it creates. People want to talk. It creates a different view of a company than people get today.''</p>
