        <p>Australia's Kerri Pottharst  Potsy to her friends -- became a beach volleyball player for the most obvious reason of all.</p>
        <p>''I loved to hang out at the beach,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Pottharst turned her cap backward and played on, even through four knee operations.</p>
        <p>Natalie Cook, Pottharst's playing partner, tread an exacting path of a different sort, occasionally across broken glass and burning coals.</p>
        <p>Seeking a competitive edge, Cook recently sought out a ''success coach.'' It's the specialty of Kurek Ashley, an American who tutored Cook in various acts of derring-do, like walking on shattered glass and hot coals.</p>
        <p>''It makes you believe the impossible isn't impossible,'' Cook said.</p>
        <p>And yet, for all their enterprise, Pottharst and Cook were never better than second to the top-rated Brazilian combination of Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar until today.</p>
        <p>Before 10,000 fans, many waving Australian flags and wearing green and gold, Pottharst and Cook defeated Bede and Behar, 12-11, 12-10, in the gold medal match. And the Australians did so in stunning fashion, with late, startling rallies that left the home crowd delirious.</p>
        <p>Brazil also took home the bronze, as Adriana Samuel and Sandra Pires defeated Japan's Yukiko Takahashi and Teru Saiki, 12-4, 12-10.</p>
        <p>Pottharst and Cook had worked at the karma of their matchup, filling their team lodgings in the last month with dozens of things colored gold -- replica medals, goldfish, goblets, volleyballs and wall hangings. They bought gold toothpaste and gold shampoo.</p>
        <p>''Our plan was to have this tidal wave of emotion and thought,'' Cook said. ''And to have it wash over the Brazilians.''</p>
        <p>Today, surfers cruising Pacific Ocean whitecaps were visible through the portals of the makeshift grandstand that rises above shimmering Bondi Beach. On the sand below, Pottharst and Cook were riding a swell of their own.</p>
        <p>When it was over, Pottharst lay face down in the sand for half a minute with Cook kneeling over her.</p>
        <p>''I just lost it,'' said Pottharst, who at 35 is 10 years Cook's senior. ''I could not believe we had won. You dream of something forever, and when it happens, sometimes it's too amazing to comprehend.''</p>
        <p>Behar and a tearful Bede, who later apologized to Brazilian fans for the loss, were also embracing at their end of the court.</p>
        <p>''It was a great scene today, a great party,'' said Behar, who won a gold medal with a different partner four years ago. ''But you have to know the disappointment for us, too.''</p>
        <p>For Pottharst and Cook, it was the end of an odd four-year journey. Now the ''best of mates,'' Cook said, they had split as playing partners after the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where  they teamed to win a bronze medal.</p>
        <p>''We're 10 years apart, and it had become too much like big sister and little sister,'' Cook said. ''I needed to learn some things for myself.''</p>
        <p>Reunited last year, they agreed to come together as equals. ''Though we still get on each other's nerves,'' Cook said.</p>
        <p>Pottharst brought her powerful serve, Cook a consistency in all areas and some fresher, younger legs. They needed both today, especially when the Brazilians took 10-6 leads in both games. The first team to 12 points wins.</p>
        <p>The Australians won the first game, also called a set, when Cook's serve hit the top of the net and fell straight down. So a lucky break brought the first big ovation.</p>
        <p>Bede and Behar looked stunned, but took the same commanding 10-6 lead in the next game. Consecutive spikes by Cook cut Brazil's lead in half, and then with Pottharst serving, the Australians tied the score, 10-10. Pottharst was again serving at 11-10 when a return by Bede shockingly fell wide of the sideline.</p>
        <p>Pottharst fell to her knees and buried her head. Earlier in the week, she had called the large crowd distracting.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't used to it,'' she said. ''We don't play before crowds like that. I wanted to say, 'Would you all just shut up?' ''</p>
        <p>But Pottharst and Cook came to embrace the crowd. They included the fans as partners in their pursuit of the gold medal, a movement they called the Dreamachine.</p>
        <p>As Pottharst lay in the sand in victory, Cook beside her, the ovation reverberated around the natural rock formation that protects Bondi Beach's radiant sandy shore. Suddenly, Pottharst jumped to her feet and threw handfuls of sand in the air.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, hat still on backward, she addressed the crowd.</p>
        <p>''I know it's a dream,'' Potsy said, ''but I'll remember this day for the rest of my life.''</p>
