        <p>In the 13 years since she graduated, Cheryl Jenkins Haywood has viewed calls from Harvard Law School as an intrusion. When it asked for her help in recruiting others like her -- young, talented and black -- she refused.</p>
        <p>As she puts it, ''I didn't want to tell them how much I hated it.''</p>
        <p>For many black alumni, being at Harvard Law School meant feeling as though other students, and even the school, regarded them as simply ''affirmative-action babies,'' as one alumnus put it -- there by dint of race, not merit.</p>
        <p>But this weekend, as Harvard University officials stood before them and declared, ''This is your school,'' many black alumni said they felt for the first time that maybe it was.</p>
        <p>About 600 returned -- some for the first time in 20 or 30 years -- to attend the law school's first black alumni weekend. They came because they were persuaded that the school had begun to make progress, that it wanted to recognize their experiences and their contributions.</p>
        <p>Some blacks, and some colleges, question whether this is another form of segregation, the very thing they have fought against for decades.</p>
        <p>Still, across the country, colleges and universities have added similar events to their rosters of fall homecomings. At Holy Cross in Massachusetts, Macalester College in Minnesota and Colorado College, black alumni who left campus profoundly ambivalent are being welcomed back for the first time with features like Sunday gospel brunches and black music acts.</p>
        <p>Clearly, the reunions are partly an exercise in public relations. Schools have for years lamented that black alumni do not attend regular reunions or donate much money. At Harvard Law, many people still recall divisive debates in the late 1980's over what some students called a lag in hiring of black professors.</p>
        <p>But the institutions and alumni say the timing of these events has much to do with the waning of affirmative action, under legal and political attack in the past five years. Universities have sought ways beyond racial and ethnic preferences to attract top black candidates, deciding that one method is to mend relations with black graduates, each one a potential ambassador of his alma mater.</p>
        <p>An argument institutions make in favor of continuing affirmative action is that it has worked -- it has created the core of the country's black professional class.</p>
        <p>For the alumni, the reunions offer a chance to show that they made good use of the opportunities they were given, for their own sakes and for the sake of the larger debate.</p>
        <p>''This will send a clarion call,'' said Eric V. Moye, a trial lawyer and former state district judge in Texas who graduated from Harvard Law in 1979. ''You name a walk of life and one of our brethren is at the vanguard. That says to the whole country, 'The whole notion of black inferiority is bull.'</p>
        <p>''It says to the schools, 'If you work hard to find people and you give them a chance they will not only succeed, they will flourish. It doesn't diminish the quality of your institution, it doesn't diminish the quality of your student body. In fact, it enriches both.' ''</p>
        <p>To some blacks, though, the race-specific attention emphasizes the separate too much, and officials at some schools question how far to tailor the events. At some schools, gay alumni are pressing for a reunion of their own. Williams College renamed its reunion ''Alumni of Color,'' after Hispanic- and Asian-Americans sought their own reunions.</p>
        <p>''When was the last time the Jewish alumni had a reunion? It's ridiculous,'' said William T. Coleman, a former secretary of transportation honored at Harvard this weekend for his work on the team that argued the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation case. When Mr. Coleman graduated from the law school in 1946, he could not find a job as a lawyer in Philadelphia. Now, he said, ''There's much more opportunity than there's ever been.''</p>
        <p>Others, though, say the point is not segregation, but celebration.</p>
        <p>''Our gathering is a real symbol for progress at Harvard and for society at large,'' said Stephanie K. Bell-Rose, head of the Goldman Sachs Foundation and a 1984 graduate. ''Reflecting on that progress at different stages is important.''</p>
        <p>In part, the institutions could not have held such events much earlier because, as Harvard President Neil L. Rudenstine told the alumni Saturday, ''Fifteen or 20 years ago, there were not enough people to show up.''</p>
        <p>The truth is, many here this weekend said they would not have attended earlier gatherings. Almost all expressed deep appreciation for the opportunity to earn a Harvard law degree. But they also recalled the difficulty of being in what was for many years a tiny minority.</p>
        <p>As recently as 1965, there was only one black student in Harvard Law's graduating class. Even in the 1980's, black students were angered by what they saw as the school's slowness in hiring black professors and recruiting black students.</p>
        <p>''They thought their job was well done to have gotten us there,'' said Deborah C. Wright, class of 1984, now head of Carver Bancorp, the nation's largest black-operated bank.</p>
        <p>Some suspicion of the institutions is tempered by age. Others come back because they see someone at the institution who look like them. At Smith College, a group of black alumni who returned in the spring of 1999 said they were inspired to attend by Ruth J. Simmons, the college's first black president. At Harvard Law, many said they came back because David Wilkins, a graduate and professor here who is black, pressed for the reunion.</p>
        <p>''This is, for me, a coming to terms with it,'' Ms. Wright said. ''It's important to make a statement to the school that we're out there, this can be a positive resource if you're willing to listen to the reality of how we felt and figure out how to use us.''</p>
        <p>Walking for the first time into the enormous tent set up behind the law school for the weekend, many alumni looked taken aback at the elaborate flowers and buffet tables -- on Sunday morning, laden with collard greens, fried chicken and grits -- and by the sheer number of black faces.</p>
        <p>Harvard devoted part of the weekend to reviewing the past; its history of blacks at Harvard cited the fact that the law school was endowed by money that the founder, Isaac Royall, earned from selling his slaves in the cane fields of Antigua.</p>
        <p>Derrick Bell, who became the law school's first black professor in 1971 and left in 1992 to protest the lack of tenured black women on the faculty, returned to a hero's ovation, the same reception that greeted Lani Guinier, Harvard Law's first black woman professor, hired in 1998. President Rudenstine defended the need for diversity on campus so ardently in a speech on Saturday that one black professor jokingly referred to him as ''Reverend Rudenstine.''</p>
        <p>''What you have brought to Harvard means every bit, if not more, than what you take away,'' Mr. Rudenstine told the alumni. ''We, as an institution, need you.''</p>
        <p>By the end, some who arrived reluctant left grateful. ''Everyone keeps saying this is the best time they ever had at Harvard,'' said Ms. Jenkins Haywood, who until recently was a law clerk in Brooklyn's drug-treatment court.</p>
        <p>Now, she said, she would welcome those calls from the law school, even help recruit. ''To be here in true numbers, it makes us feel like we really were here.''</p>
