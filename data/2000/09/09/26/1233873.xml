        <p>I was in Eads, Colo., recently, just passing through, which is true of nearly everyone who has ever come to Eads. The town lies on a major truck route across southeastern Colorado.</p>
        <p>What Eads takes from that truck route is hard to tell. A few people stop now and then at Shepp's drive-in on the edge of town. Plastic lambs line the windowsills, and you can read a religious magazine called Guideposts while you wait for lunch, for the full name of Shepp's is the Good Sheppard Inn.</p>

        <p>I was in Eads, Colo., recently, just passing through, which is true of nearly everyone who has ever come to Eads. The town lies on a major truck route across southeastern Colorado.</p>
        <p>What Eads takes from that truck route is hard to tell. A few people stop now and then at Shepp's drive-in on the edge of town. Plastic lambs line the windowsills, and you can read a religious magazine called Guideposts while you wait for lunch, for the full name of Shepp's is the Good Sheppard Inn.</p>
        <p>But only the locals turn off the truck route and onto the main street of Eads. On one side of the street lies the Crow-Luther Arts Center, which used to be the Plains movie theater. Its marquee says, almost ironically, ''THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THE FINE ARTS.'' One of the E's has blown sideways in the wind.</p>
        <p>Across the street and down a little is the Kiowa County Museum, an old-fashioned brick building with a concrete stoop. Inside you can see the optimistic plat that was laid out for Eads many decades ago, a grid of house lots marching off to every quarter of the compass. You can see a few collections of arrowheads and some old-fashioned kitchen equipment -- a couple of pressure cookers and a wood-fired stove. One room is devoted to a frightening display meant to simulate an antiquated medical examining room.</p>
        <p>There is a room full of cowboy gear, and there is a photograph of the record corn harvest before dust obscured the future of agriculture in Kiowa County. The pathos lies not in the objects themselves but in what you would need to know about the life at hand to give them their real meaning, a knowledge not readily available to passers-by.</p>
        <p>But on one wall, even a stranger could decipher the whole story. Leaning against the wall was the side panel of a school bus from 70 years ago. Above it was pinned the receipt the county coroner submitted for mileage costs. There were banner headlines and the photographs of five children. They had boarded a bus after school with 15 other children on March 26, 1931, in Towner, Colo., a small town almost on the Kansas line. The bus was caught in deepening snowfall a few miles south of Towner, caught in the kind of spring blizzard that ranchers dread. Some panes of glass were missing in the school bus, and snow drifted in. By the time the children were rescued at noon two days later, five were dead. The body of the bus driver, who was the father of the youngest child to die, was found in the open fields, his hands badly lacerated from trying to follow a fence line to summon help.</p>
        <p>Farther south of Towner, down in the Arkansas Valley, the snow had fallen as rain. The same was true farther east, in Kansas. But the altitude at Towner, which lies due east of Eads, was just high enough to sustain a blizzard. The country there is as stark as a coroner's receipt even on a hot summer day with no chance of snow in it. Or perhaps that is just the way it seems after reading those old headlines and looking into those almost forgotten faces. Their names were Louise Stonebreaker, Bobby Brown, Mary Louise Miller, Arlo Unte and Kenneth Johnson. The bus driver was Mary Louise's father.</p>
