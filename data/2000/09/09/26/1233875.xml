        <p>Fox Sports is bidding an estimated $2.5 billion for the entire Major League Baseball network television package for six years, ending a split of rights with NBC, industry executives said.

        <p>Fox Sports is bidding an estimated $2.5 billion for the entire Major League Baseball network television package for six years, ending a split of rights with NBC, industry executives said. Fox wants to merge everything it has broadcast since the 1996 season with NBC's package and add the division series playoff games that ESPN has carried.</p>
        <p>If successful, Fox would keep the Saturday Game of the Week, carry every All-Star Game, division series, League Championship Series and World Series game as well as retain its cable rights on Fox Sports Net and FX. Under a five-year deal that ends after this season, NBC and Fox alternated All-Star Games and the World Series and split the league championship series.</p>
        <p>Fox has paid $575 million for the rights, NBC $400 million. The cost to Fox has been higher because its deal includes the regular season and three World Series.</p>
        <p>Fox's plan to consolidate all national baseball rights, except for ESPN's and TBS's regular-season cable packages, could be moot by 5 p.m. today if NBC chooses to renew its package, which excludes regular-season games, for between $160 million and $175 million annually.</p>
        <p>''We have an offer in front of us, and we'll make our decision in a couple of days,'' Ken Schanzer, the president of NBC Sports, said.</p>
        <p>If NBC retains its package, Fox is expected to renew its existing rights. But clearly, Fox wants to broaden its scope with baseball, even though ratings have been unspectacular. The Saturday afternoon Nielsen rating peak of a 3.1 in 1998 fell to a 2.9 last season, the same as this season.</p>
        <p>World Series ratings reached a height during the contract with a 17.4 for Fox in 1996, fell to a 14.1 for the network in 1998, but recovered to a 16.0 last year for NBC. Each rating point equals 1.01 million television households.</p>
        <p>Rich Levin, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, said, ''All we're saying is we're still negotiating.''</p>
        <p>Both networks had been asked by baseball to triple their current fees  to renew their rights, to mirror the increased money baseball is getting in a new ESPN contract that was negotiated to end an acrimonious court battle.</p>
        <p>For baseball, having Fox try to trump NBC with a blockbuster offer is a coup, elevating the value of the rights Fox is trying to buy from $1.7 billion to $2.5 billion. Only six years ago, the failed Baseball Network -- a joint venture of NBC, ABC and baseball -- produced no guaranteed money for baseball and funneled little in shared revenues to baseball because of the players' strike.</p>
        <p>And from 1990 to 1993, CBS lost an estimated $500 million on its $1.06 billion deal.</p>
