        <p>Construction is under way on a  $180 million Staten Island Ferry terminal in Lower Manhattan, one piece of a city government building boom of sorts that would benefit a borough that has traditionally been shortchanged, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Collectively, as much as $410 million is to be spent in the next four years on improvements to the ferry system, which carries 61,000 passengers a day, many of them tourists, on the 22-minute, 6.2-mile trip between Staten Island and Manhattan.</p>

        <p>Construction is under way on a  $180 million Staten Island Ferry terminal in Lower Manhattan, one piece of a city government building boom of sorts that would benefit a borough that has traditionally been shortchanged, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Collectively, as much as $410 million is to be spent in the next four years on improvements to the ferry system, which carries 61,000 passengers a day, many of them tourists, on the 22-minute, 6.2-mile trip between Staten Island and Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The new Whitehall Ferry Terminal -- featuring a crystalline glass facade on the land side and stainless steel portals on the waterfront exterior, a 75-foot-high entry hall and a rooftop viewing deck -- will replace a smaller, well-worn structure that was renovated after a fire in 1991.</p>
        <p>The city also intends to start building a new terminal for the Staten Island side next year at St. George, which could cost as much as $110 million, city officials said. In addition, design work is under way for three custom-made ferryboats that will be put into service by 2004, at an estimated price of $40 million each.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani acknowledged yesterday that the city was investing a large chunk of money on Staten Island projects, including $71 million for the new minor league baseball complex and renovation of the waterfront, where a lighthouse museum, an institute of arts and sciences and a public esplanade are planned. But he said that the spending was justified because of the borough's unfair treatment by previous mayors.</p>
        <p>''In prior administrations, they spent no money on Staten Island,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''We are making up for historic lack of fairness in the treatment of Staten Island, particularly in the four years before I came into office.''</p>
        <p>The borough president, Guy V. Molinari, joked yesterday about how dealings regarding the Staten Island ferry had politically ramifications. He recalled -- later saying it was in jest -- how he had decided to campaign for Mr. Giuliani in his re-election bid for mayor after a discussion about the ferry, which used to charge 50 cents for each ride.</p>
        <p>''I cut a deal with the mayor,'' he said. ''I said, 'Mr. Mayor, I will work for you in the election, but if I do it I want something very simple: I want the ferries to be free.' ''</p>
        <p>The design of the new Whitehall Ferry Terminal has changed several times in the eight years of discussion about the project.</p>
        <p>The final design for the Whitehall project, which is being financed partly by federal and state grants, was prepared by Schwartz Architects. The existing building will be demolished as the new one goes up, but at no time during the two-and-a-half-year project will the ferry service, which the city has provided since 1905, be interrupted, city officials said.</p>
