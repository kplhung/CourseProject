        <p>Researchers have shown for the first time that the onset of multiple sclerosis can be delayed, and its severity reduced, by drug treatment for neurological problems thought to be very early signs of the disease.</p>
        <p>The treatment consists of injections of Avonex, also called interferon beta-1a, which is already used to treat multiple sclerosis.</p>
        <p>In the three-year study, Avonex reduced the rate of development of the disease by about half in patients who were considered to be at very high risk because of symptoms that did not meet the definition of the disease but that often preceded it.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stephen Reingold, vice president for research programs at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, who was not part of the study, said: ''Nobody has ever tried an intervention this early in the course of the disease for somebody at high risk for developing multiple sclerosis. The results are both clinically and statistically significant.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Reingold emphasized that the study did not continue long enough to show that Avonex prevents multiple sclerosis, only that the drug delays it.</p>
        <p>About 250,000 to 350,000 Americans, two to three times as many women as men, have multiple sclerosis. It is an autoimmune disorder, in which the patient's immune system attacks the nervous system. It destroys myelin, the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, and gradually damages the nerves themselves. Although it is not commonly fatal, it can cause permanent weakness, paralysis and cognitive problems.</p>
        <p>The experiment, in which half of 383 patients got placebos and half took Avonex, had to be halted a year early because data revealed that the Avonex group was doing so much better. All patients were then offered the drug.</p>
        <p>''The study was so positive it was unethical to continue it,'' said Dr. Lawrence D. Jacobs, head of neurology at Buffalo General Hospital and director of the research, which was conducted at 50 hospitals in the United States and Canada from April 1996 until March 2000.</p>
        <p>Patients in the study had all had one episode of neurological symptoms, including double or cloudy vision, and problems with balance, strength or bladder or bowel control. They also had brain lesions suggesting myelin damage that showed up on magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
        <p>Patients are usually not considered to have the disease until they have two such episodes at different times, affecting different parts of the brain, and until other conditions like brain tumors and lupus are ruled out.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, those who have had only one episode are considered at high risk.</p>
        <p>Of the 383 patients in the study, 193 got Avonex and 190 got placebos. Over three years, 76 in the placebo group developed the disease, as opposed to only 46 in the Avonex group.</p>
        <p>The drug, made by Biogen Inc., costs about $10,000 a year. But because it has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for multiple sclerosis and not for patients merely at risk, some insurers may not cover it.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 27, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about using the drug Avonex (also called interferon beta-1a) to delay the onset of multiple sclerosis omitted the source of the research report. It is scheduled for publication tomorrow in The New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
