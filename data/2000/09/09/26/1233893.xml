        <p>No greater irony could impose itself on the playoffs than the presence of the Chicago White Sox. No. 26 in the Major League Baseball payroll standing for most of the season, the White Sox have the majors' best won-lost record and are the newly crowned champions of the American League Central.</p>
        <p>That the White Sox could go so far on so little is a tribute to every facet of their organization, beginning with Jerry Reinsdorf, the chairman. But that's where irony rears its delicious head.</p>
        <p>As the players association's Enemy No. 1, as an owner who would fight the players to the catastrophic end over control of players salaries, Reinsdorf has produced a team that undermines every argument the owners make about salaries and payroll disparity. At a time when officials and owners have identified payroll disparity as the game's most pressing problem, a team that pays its players one-third the amount the Yankees pay theirs has already clinched its spot at the postseason party, while the Yankees still plod on to secure their place.</p>
        <p>Not only that, but the Cleveland Indians, with a payroll twice that of the White Sox, have been bumped from their perennial place in the A.L. Central and may not even earn an invitation to the party.</p>
        <p>But then, in terms of economic impact, this has been a very different season from last. Last season the playoffs were populated by teams with 8 of the 11 highest payrolls. The trend was painfully clear, officials and owners lamented, and would never be reversed without some drastic change in the system.</p>
        <p>A big payroll did not guarantee postseason play, they said in a frequent refrain, but a team could not reach postseason play without a big payroll. But this is a new year. Times have changed quickly. This season only four or five of the top 14 teams in payroll will play games after next Sunday. They are the Yankees, the Mets, Atlanta, St. Louis and maybe the Indians.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers and the Baltimore Orioles once again lead the big spenders who have gained the least for their money. One wonders if they'll ever get it right. The Arizona Diamondbacks, who won a division championship last season, added about $10 million to their payroll this season, but may as well spend this October in the swimming pool beyond the right-center-field fence at their ballpark. Those three teams began the season among the top five in payroll.</p>
        <p>Seattle, on the other hand, was 15th and San Francisco 17th. Close to the bottom were the White Sox and just ahead of them the Oakland Athletics. Three or all four of those teams will play postseason games.</p>
        <p>In the interest of having Reinsdorf, the most militant of owners, explain how his poorly paid White Sox could outplay far wealthier teams, a telephone call was placed to his office in Chicago yesterday and then a request for a telephone interview was placed with the team's public relations department. The subject of the interview was provided.</p>
        <p>''No, thanks,'' came the reply from Reinsdorf via a club spokesman. Maybe he's saving his secrets for a book. But is this any way to persuade the players something has to be done to adjust payrolls?</p>
        <p>Billy Beane, the Athletics' general manager, was not as reticent about addressing the subject.</p>
        <p>''Certainly we'd like to make that an antiquated argument,'' he said, referring to the payroll-disparity issue. ''But the realism of it all is I think this is a pretty unique situation in Oakland. It's a testament to the talent of the young players who are here, but the system hasn't allowed any guarantee that we can retain our best players in the prime of their careers. These young players are not going go be young and inexpensive for long.''</p>
        <p>Beane's last comment was one of the points Commissioner Bud Selig made. ''I won't deny there's a potential for an aberration once in a while,'' Selig said. ''But the fact is the cost of keeping the White Sox up there will be so high. When the Reds almost made it last year, Jim Bowden said don't think this aberration makes the system right,'' he said referring to the Cincinnati general manager.</p>
        <p>The White Sox and the Athletics aside, Selig said, disparity remains a problem.</p>
        <p>''I think you definitely have overwhelming evidence of a correlation between high payroll and winning,'' he said. ''See me next year. I'm confident of that. Remember, you still have the same teams winning, the Yankees, Atlanta, the Mets. Let's see what happens in the playoffs. If there's an aberration, it's a quick short aberration.''</p>
        <p>He recalled what Drayton McLane Jr., the Houston owner, said of the Astros' three division titles: ''Someone had to win the National League Central, but we got banged out in the first round each time.''</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the people in the union office offered a different view of this season's developments.</p>
        <p>''I think at a certain point you have to have some sympathy for the owners,'' Gene Orza, the union's No. 2 man, said, then proceeded to cite examples of dire projections some owners have presented during labor negotiations in the last 15 years.</p>
        <p>''In 1985 it was Oakland going out of business and they turned around and won three division championships in a row,'' Orza said. ''Then they picked Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh won a few division championships. Then it was San Diego, but San Diego was in the World Series. It's been a string of bad luck for them, almost Kafkaesque bad luck.''</p>
        <p>If Reinsdorf shows up at any of the negotiating sessions next year after talks for a new collective bargaining agreement begin, the dialogue between him and Orza would probably be worth the price of a playoff ticket.</p>
