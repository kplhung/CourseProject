        <p>The investment banking arm of ING Groep N.V., ING Barings, predicted that investors might pull $122 billion out of the Japanese stock market as a result of changes that Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, The Financial Times and Dow Jones Inc. are making in the way they compile their indexes. Elliott Flynn, a senior analyst in ING's London office, said $155 billion might flow out of Asian equity markets as a result of the changes, which assign new weights to index components based on how freely their shares trade. Thus, companies that are partly owned by governments or by other companies, of which Japan has many, will be assigned less importance in the indexes.</p>
