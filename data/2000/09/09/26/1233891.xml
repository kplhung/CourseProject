        <p>A highlight film preceded his entrance, offering archival evidence of Patrick Ewing in his prime, back when he could finish a fast break with an inspiring dunk and an emphatic scowl, or spin swiftly past an opponent and drop a baby-finger roll into the bucket.</p>
        <p>Ewing's era in New York officially ended today when the former Knicks center attended a news conference here and draped a green and white SuperSonics jersey in front of his 38-year-old frame, symbolically removing himself from the team he led for 15 seasons.</p>
        <p>Ewing sat down, looked again at his new No. 33 jersey and gave a reflective smile.</p>
        <p>''It's a new start for me. It's like fresh air,'' Ewing said. ''Sometimes, change can be like the fountain of youth, another chapter in your life.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to kid you, I am nervous. I've been in New York 15 years and on the East Coast my entire life. But this is a challenge and an opportunity I'm looking forward to.''</p>
        <p>In his first public statements since the four-team, 12-player and four-draft-pick trade -- the biggest in National Basketball Association history -- Ewing gave no hint of animosity toward the Knicks, calling his departure a mutual decision. He talked of playing into his 40's and finishing his career as a Sonic.</p>
        <p>''They tell me that I'm old and ancient, but I think I left my wheelchair back in New York,'' Ewing said. ''I felt I have a lot of basketball left in me. My goal is to play as many games as I can, stay healthy and rested and be ready for the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>Ewing added: ''Athletically, I'm not where I was back in my prime, but mentally, I'm much better. When I think about what I knew back then and what I know now, I realize how great I could have been.</p>
        <p>''I can still play. I can still make a contribution. I can still help a team win. I'll be ready to play when they throw the ball up.''</p>
        <p>Ewing said that he requested a trade last spring, after the Knicks lost to the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals.</p>
        <p>At that point, management agreed to shop him around the league. Ewing's agent, David Falk, said the Sonics were high on his client's list of five or six teams.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Sonics' mission was to acquire a true center to go with their All-Stars Vin Baker and Gary Payton. The acquisition of Ewing means the 6-foot-11-inch Baker can now play power forward.</p>
        <p>With Ewing in the middle, Payton can become even more of a daring playmaker.</p>
        <p>''Our priority was to get bigger and stronger,'' said Wally Walker, the Sonics' president and general manager. ''We had a good team, but we needed more. This trade transformed our franchise and our roster.''</p>
        <p>Ewing stopped short of saying he was the last piece to the Sonics' championship puzzle. But when asked about his dream scenario in Seattle, he said he envisioned the one victory party that had eluded him as a Knick.</p>
        <p>''Where will you have the parade when we win it all?'' Ewing asked Sonics Coach Paul Westphal. ''My best-case scene is us winning the championship and me finally getting to ride on that float.''</p>
        <p>Had he not been traded, Ewing said he would have remained a loyal Knick.</p>
        <p>''I would have went in and did my job and tried my best to win,'' Ewing said ''I have no ill feelings or will toward the Knicks. They have compensated me well over the years. I wish I could have brought them a championship, but it didn't happen.''</p>
        <p>Ewing said it was a combination of things that made him request the trade.</p>
        <p>''I'm definitely going to miss the Garden,'' he said. ''I'll miss a lot of the fans and my friends. We had good times and bad times, but for the most part, I loved being there.''</p>
        <p>Ewing will be in uniform next Monday when the Sonics open training camp. The Knicks face the Sonics here on Nov. 14. Ewing's first trip to Madison Square Garden will be Feb. 27.</p>
        <p>Speaking in a videotaped interview from the Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Baker and Payton agreed that the addition of Ewing should make the Sonics contenders for the Western Conference title.</p>
        <p>''He better get a lot of ice for his knees, because we're going to want him to run a bit,'' Payton said. ''With Patrick, people are going to expect a lot from us. Now we can play with the Portlands and the Lakers and bang with their big men. We're going to be able to go deep in the playoffs.''</p>
