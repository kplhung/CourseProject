        <p>Concern About Earnings Continues to Hobble Stocks  Stock prices slipped again, pulled down by continued worries about coming earnings reports from big technology companies.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index fell for a third consecutive session, dropping 62.54 points, or 1.6 percent, to 3,741.22. Meanwhile, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index declined 9.69 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,439.03. And the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 39.22 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,808.15.

        <p>Shares of Sotheby's Climb 15%  Shares of Sotheby's Holdings rose more than 15 percent after the board of the auction house agreed to pay $256 million to settle a class-action suit that accused it of colluding with its archrival Christie's to fix commissions charged to buyers and sellers. The board's action also set off speculation that the company is more ripe than ever for a takeover. Shares of Sotheby's rose $3.13, to $23.44. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Taco Recall Prompts Call for Labels  The discovery of an unapproved variety of genetically engineered corn in a brand of taco shells is prompting new calls for the labeling of bioengineered foods. But the case, which led Kraft Foods to announce a nationwide recall, also offers a foretaste of some of the practical difficulties involved in such labeling. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Legislation on Cruise Ship Dumping  Congress is close to passing legislation that the Justice Department says would legalize the dumping of toxic chemicals from the dry cleaning and photo processing of cruise ships, offenses for which Royal Caribbean pleaded guilty last year. But the provision's Senate sponsor said it would protect the environment by limiting where ships can dump waste water in Alaska. A spokesman said the provision was not meant to let ships put chemicals like cleaning fluids into their waste water. [A14.]</p>
        <p>NTT DoCoMo in Talks on AOL Link  NTT DoCoMo, the largest mobile communications company in Japan, confirmed that it was in advanced talks about an alliance with America Online. A deal could greatly expand AOL's presence in Japan. [C16.]</p>
        <p>Rise in Domestic Partner Benefits  More companies than ever before are offering health insurance benefits to partners of gay and lesbian employees, including more than 100 of the Fortune 500 companies. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Shares of Drug Maker Plummet  Shares of Cell Pathways, which said on Friday that it had been told by the Food and Drug Administration that its drug Aptosyn would not be approved went into free fall, losing two-thirds of their value. The stock closed at $9.31, down $20.69. Robert W. Towarnicki, president of Cell Pathways, said in a conference call with investors that the company had not yet received a letter from the F.D.A. outlining the agency's reasons. So he could not say whether the F.D.A. had major objections that would virtually kill the drug or minor ones that would only postpone approval. [C12.]</p>
        <p>Comptrollers Seek AT&amp;T Meeting  The comptrollers of the State and City of New York, representing pension funds for public employees that are among the largest shareholders in AT&amp;T, have requested a meeting with its chairman to discuss the company's long-term prospects. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Firestone and State Officials to Meet  Firestone, which is embroiled in the recall of 6.5 million tires, said that it would meet this week with attorneys general from 38 states to discuss the recall. In related news, Ford said that it was delaying production of the 2002 Ford Explorer at its St. Louis assembly plant because of the recall. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Debut for Satellite Phone Venture  After months of gloomy news in the satellite communications sector, analysts are looking forward to the debut tomorrow of the Asia Cellular Satellite System, an Indonesian satellite phone venture focused on Asia. [C12.]</p>
