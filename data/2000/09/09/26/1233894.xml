        <p>More than 600 police officers were at Shea Stadium when Rocker, who made inflammatory remarks about New York City, Mets fans, foreigners and the No. 7 subway train, was here three months ago.

        <p>John Rocker will be in New York with the Braves again for a three-game series starting tonight, and the Mets will use most of the same security measures that were in place when Rocker visited Shea Stadium for the first time this season in June.</p>
        <p>More than 600 police officers were at Shea Stadium when Rocker, who made inflammatory remarks about New York City, Mets fans, foreigners and the No. 7 subway train, was here three months ago. David Howard, the Mets' senior vice president for business and legal affairs, would not say how many officers would be in attendance this time, but it is believed there will be close to 500. There are 45 officers at a typical Mets game.</p>
        <p>''There will still be a significant police presence,'' Howard said. ''We definitely get the sense that there seems to be less focus on him in particular and more focus on where the team stands in relation to the Braves.''</p>
        <p>Howard said the Mets had also restored the protection that they had constructed near the visitor's bullpen in left field to protect Rocker, who is the Braves' closer. There will be a tall fence alongside the bleacher seats near the bullpen and a canopy over the bullpen's bench and mounds. Howard noted that the extra police and security details had been effective during Rocker's first visit. More than 40,000 fans are expected for each of the Mets-Braves games this week.</p>
