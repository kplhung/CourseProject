        <p>In a concession to the complexity of running a 21st-century school board, the New York City Board of Education is planning to add outside experts from the corporate world, government and community organizations to its committees that deal with everything from finance to education policy.</p>
        <p>Although the board has previously asked outside experts to serve on temporary task forces, this will be the first time the board has used outsiders on its permanent committees. Education policy experts say the board's plan is one of the first such moves by a school board in the country.</p>
        <p>The new plan comes as school boards around the country are being called on to deal with issues that range far beyond education policy, including details of employment law, computer networks and financial management. Increasingly, education experts say, school boards are not up to the task.</p>
        <p>''School systems, and life in general, have become more complex,'' said Carol A. Gresser, a former president of the board. ''They are no longer places where kids go just to learn to read and write. They've become a one-stop shop where parents drop kids off and ask the school to raise them. Schools offer dental care, distribute condoms'' and offer a variety of other programs that school board members are not qualified, by themselves, to oversee, she said.</p>
        <p>The outsiders, who will be appointed as committee advisers by board members who are not themselves members of a given committee, will have no voting rights. They may be affiliated with the public, private or nonprofit sectors, and they will be reviewed for potential conflicts of interest.</p>
        <p>William C. Thompson Jr., president of the board, who outlined the new policy in a memorandum to board members on Sept. 15, said in an interview that the change was intended to ''make us smarter.''</p>
        <p>''We need to bring in people who have these areas of expertise to highlight the critical issues and make people aware of everything that is going on in a field,'' Mr. Thompson said. That might include budget and financial experts from corporations or government agencies to help the audit and finance committees, or parents and community organizations to help committees that focus on English language learners or parent involvement, he said.</p>
        <p>Some advocacy groups, however, expressed initial skepticism about the plan. Ruth Cohen, president of Pencil, an organization that works to increase corporate involvement in the New York City schools, warned that unless the new committees had clear goals, the outsiders' time could easily be wasted.</p>
        <p>''I assume the committees will be structured in a way that addresses the most urgent issues first,'' Ms. Cohen said. ''They had better be careful about just putting another layer of bureaucracy on an organization that has not exhibited any special kind of talent in managing groups of people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson said that the notion of adding outsiders to board committees grew out of the board's recent experiences, most notably with the task force on teaching and learning in cyberspace. Earlier this year, that group recommended building a new education Web site for students and teachers to use in the classroom and at home, distributing portable computers to children in the 4th through 12th grades to enable them to use the site, and paying for the enterprise through a separate commercial Web site that included advertising.</p>
        <p>The cyberspace task force included representatives from several technology companies, including I.B.M., Toshiba and Cisco Systems; technology experts from the United Federation of Teachers and the Board of Education; academicians; and financial consultants.</p>
        <p>The task force was disbanded soon after making its recommendations, in part to avoid conflicts of interest, board officials said. Some of the companies represented on the task force are interested in selling products or services to the Board of Education for whatever technology program is eventually adopted.</p>
        <p>To streamline the board's committee structure, Mr. Thompson has winnowed the number of standing committees to six -- technology, education policy and program development, English language learners and special education, finance, audit, and parent outreach and involvement -- and appointed two board members, one as chairman, to each committee.</p>
        <p>Previously, three board members were assigned to each of as many as a dozen committees; some of those groups had been all but dormant for years, board officials said.</p>
        <p>Board members were asked to submit recommendations for advisory appointments to Mr. Thompson by Friday.</p>
        <p>Warren Simmons, the director of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University, said that school boards typically rely on experts on a district's staff for advice on technical issues, which presents an inherent conflict of interest between the board and the people it is supposed to oversee.</p>
        <p>Similarly, task forces that include outside experts are helpful for bringing in new ideas to a school system, but their limited life span denies the school board any ongoing expertise on an issue after the task force issues its recommendations, Mr. Simmons said.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a move in a good direction to bring in independent experts,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gresser, the director of the Institute for School Board Leadership at Teachers College at Columbia University, said the new policy could be effective ''as long as they don't just round up the usual suspects'' of academic experts and policy advocates who have advised the board for decades.</p>
        <p>''The mission of any school board is to get out into the community and talk to the community-based organizations, the neighborhood leaders and business people,'' Ms. Gresser said. But school boards generally have forgotten that mission, getting too caught up in local politics and micromanagement of the district superintendent, she said.</p>
        <p>In addition to screening advisory panel members for potential conflicts of interest, Mr. Thompson said in his memo to the board that advisers would not participate in all committee activities. ''There may be an an occasion when the committee is discussing confidential information and advisory members may be asked not to join a specific meeting,'' he said.</p>
