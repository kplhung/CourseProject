        <p>The faces in the Rangers' front office are very different this fall. On the ice, however, many of the faces on the Rangers' top three lines will be the same, with a few exceptions.</p>
        <p>True, the Rangers went out and re-signed Mark Messier after a three-year split. And they signed the free-agent defenseman Vladimir Malakhov from the Stanley Cup champion Devils, to help Brian Leetch direct the power play.</p>
        <p>Glen Sather, the new president and general manager, also obtained Sandy McCarthy to provide some toughness. Ron Low, the Rangers' coach, also indicated yesterday that at least one rookie defenseman, Dale Purinton, ''stands a great chance of making the club.''</p>
        <p>Low also called Manny Malhotra and Jeff Ulmer the two most pleasant surprises of camp.</p>
        <p>Both could make the squad, and Low did not rule out trying Malhotra, who prefers to play center, on left wing if he forces his way onto the regular-season roster.</p>
        <p>Before the Devils pounded the Rangers, 8-2, at Madison Square Garden in an exhibition game last night, Low also said, ''There is a pretty good chance that the turnover is going to be pretty small.''</p>
        <p>Low later amended that statement. ''I guess you would have to say there are still a few spots open out there after that game,'' the coach said. But the Rangers appear willing to give most of last season's underachievers a second chance.</p>
        <p>Which means that Pavel Brendl and Jamie Lundmark, two highly touted 19-year-old prospects, will probably not make the team this fall. ''I don't think you can hand a job to anybody,'' Low said. ''If a guy's not ready to play, he's not ready to play.'' Speaking specifically about Brendl, a healthy scratch last night, Low said, ''He will get a couple more chances to show his stuff.''</p>
        <p>One opportunity will come tonight on the road against the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets. Brendl will be skating in his third preseason game. ''Pavel has had a decent training camp, and Jamie has gotten better every game also,'' Low said. ''But they're both 19 years old.''</p>
        <p>In this camp, Brendl has gone out of his way to show that he can do more than score. But he has yet to flash his scoring touch against much tougher competition. And that has left the Rangers wondering if Brendl might need another season at a lower level before he is ready to contend for a job in the National Hockey League.</p>
        <p>Lundmark, who was with the Moose Jaw Warriors of the Western Hockey League, missed the second half of last season with a broken bone in his right wrist. The Rangers feel that another season of juniors will help Lundmark in the long run.</p>
        <p>Without Brendl and Lundmark around, the Rangers' top three lines appear fairly set. Messier will most likely center a line with Adam Graves at left wing and perhaps John MacLean at right wing -- MacLean is still bothered by a bad back, however. The Czech line, which has Petr Nedved centering Jan Hlavac and Radek Dvorak, remains intact. And Low has liked what he has seen of Mike York centering a line with Valery Kamensky and Theo Fleury.</p>
        <p>That leaves McCarthy as the fourth-line right wing, with either Tim Taylor or Malhotra in the middle. Another option would have Eric Lacroix or Malhotra on left wing. Should Ulmer make the team, he could spell anyone on the fourth line.</p>
        <p>On defense, Brian Leetch will almost certainly be paired with Sylvain Lefebvre. The rest of the picture is muddled, especially with Jason Doig (whose nose was broken by the Devils' Colin White last night) and Mike Mottau still contending for the team.</p>
        <p>''It would be hard to choose a star for us tonight,'' Low said. ''But if there was one, it was likely Mottau. He was likely the best player out there by a long, long ways. But that's not saying much.''</p>
        <p>Mottau, who is unsigned, might be a victim of numbers. Both Purinton and Doig need to clear waivers to be sent to Hartford of the American Hockey League. But the Rangers would probably love to trade Stephane Quintal and open up some room. Another veteran, Rich Pilon, might be a candidate to be left unprotected in this week's waiver draft.</p>
        <p>In net, the Rangers are trying to hold on while Mike Richter recovers from knee surgery. ''I think the third week of October is definitely realistic,'' he said last night when asked about a target date for his return.</p>
        <p>The team has to be hoping that Kirk McLean, who is the No. 1 goalie for now, stays healthy. The performances last night of Jean-Francois Labbe and Johan Holmqvist, the two goalies fighting to be McLean's backup when the season begins next week, were not encouraging.</p>
