        <p>Senator Charles E. Schumer told members of one of Silicon Alley's largest trade groups yesterday that if the city is to remain competitive in the technology industry it must create more options for less-expensive commercial space, force competition into the high-speed Internet field and train more skilled workers.</p>
        <p>Senator Schumer, Democrat of New York, told about 1,000 people gathered in a ballroom at the Brooklyn Marriott for the annual New York Software Summit that a decade ago the city was reeling and that it was ''surely at the bottom of any company's list as a prospective business site'' until Silicon Alley began to revive the economy of Lower Manhattan in the mid-1990's. The event was sponsored by the New York Software Industry Association, a trade group.</p>

        <p>Senator Charles E. Schumer told members of one of Silicon Alley's largest trade groups yesterday that if the city is to remain competitive in the technology industry it must create more options for less-expensive commercial space, force competition into the high-speed Internet field and train more skilled workers.</p>
        <p>Senator Schumer, Democrat of New York, told about 1,000 people gathered in a ballroom at the Brooklyn Marriott for the annual New York Software Summit that a decade ago the city was reeling and that it was ''surely at the bottom of any company's list as a prospective business site'' until Silicon Alley began to revive the economy of Lower Manhattan in the mid-1990's. The event was sponsored by the New York Software Industry Association, a trade group.</p>
        <p>There are now about 138,000 technology jobs in New York City, compared with about 27,000 in 1993, according to a New York New Media Association study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and released in March.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer said the hiring by Silicon Alley companies ''exceeds the number employed in banking, construction, legal services and the apparel business'' and has helped diversify the city's economy.</p>
        <p>He said that the city had taken a step in the right direction by offering incentives to technology companies interested in moving outside Lower Manhattan and into places like Harlem, the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Long Island City, Queens. But without guarantees that the companies will be able to receive high-speed Internet access in those locations, there is no way New York will be able to compete, he added.</p>
        <p>''If we don't, we will suffocate the new-media industry or drive them into the arms of New Jersey industrial park developers,'' Mr. Schumer said.</p>
