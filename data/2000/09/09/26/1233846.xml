        <p>IF you wanted a house fit for a children's picture book, you could do no better than Mia Farrow's home in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Snow White, happening upon it, would say it was perfect, especially for a large family:  Down a hill on a dirt road you go, and there, behind a white picket fence and an overgrown English garden, is a pretty old farmhouse, with little rooms with low ceilings. There's a goldfish pond in front, a small lake in the back, four dogs, chickens in a coop, a cat. Even the name is storybook perfect: Frog Hollow.</p>

        <p>IF you wanted a house fit for a children's picture book, you could do no better than Mia Farrow's home in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Snow White, happening upon it, would say it was perfect, especially for a large family:  Down a hill on a dirt road you go, and there, behind a white picket fence and an overgrown English garden, is a pretty old farmhouse, with little rooms with low ceilings. There's a goldfish pond in front, a small lake in the back, four dogs, chickens in a coop, a cat. Even the name is storybook perfect: Frog Hollow.</p>
        <p>We are talking an older and wiser and financially independent Snow White here, by the way: Snow White at 54 in baggy jeans and an old Gap T-shirt, with 70 choice acres in Litchfield County and more of a sense of humor than you might think. A Snow White who had relationships with famous men that were not always wonderful, who lost one of her 14 children to death earlier this year, who calls up her friend Carly Simon to congratulate her on her song about her mastectomy scars. Snow White in middle age, with a bemused and cautious attitude about the press.</p>
        <p>Duty is the reason she's talking now, doing the celebrity spokeswoman thing.</p>
        <p>The cause is polio, a conference on the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, which the United Nations Children's Fund has called for tomorrow at the United Nations. The goal is eradication of polio by 2005. It seems to be working: In 1988, there were an estimated 350,000 cases worldwide; last year, an estimated 20,000, but would you be paying attention if not for the chance to get a look at Mia and find how she can afford to raise all those kids? (Answer, offered dryly: ''Well, I work sometimes. I just did a movie for Showtime. You probably haven't noticed.'')</p>
        <p>Ms. Farrow, who had polio when she was 9, is speaking at the conference. She will be accompanied by her adopted son Thaddeus, 12, who was abandoned at a Calcutta train station as a young child. He also had polio. His legs are scarred from dragging himself on the ground. He gets about today with braces or a wheelchair.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farrow suffered no serious physical damage. But sitting on her back porch, she talks about being isolated in a polio ward for three weeks. She was allowed no physical contact with her family. Orphaned, in a sense; she heard adults scream, and she saw other children die.</p>
        <p>She is not a believer in psychoanalysis. If you want to theorize about the effects of having had a father (the director and writer John Farrow) who was brilliant, alcoholic and a womanizer and a mother (the actress Maureen O'Sullivan) who soothed and placated and kept the family together or to tie that to an actress who married or became involved with talented, difficult men (Frank Sinatra, Andre Previn, Woody Allen), you're on your own.</p>
        <p>THE effects of polio, Ms. Farrow will discuss. ''I believe it's why I wanted to be a mother to a child who had the disease. I theorize those weeks in the hospital gave me perhaps a social conscience, the beginning of empathy, maybe.''</p>
        <p>A bit of self-apology, which sometimes flares up. ''Of course, I'm only theorizing, but it was such an eye opener. I had not realized, growing up in Beverly Hills, that such things existed. I'm sure that's why I have the children that I have, children with disabilities. The number I don't know.''</p>
        <p>That is one of the big questions: Why does Mia Farrow keep adopting all these children? There are five now at home, ranging from 5 to 15.</p>
        <p>''Well, it's not continuing,'' Ms. Farrow says. ''I come from a large family, there were seven of us. I raised seven children and began a second family of seven again.''</p>
        <p>A mild complaint. ''It's always odd to me that I have to defend my sanity in those circumstances. If I kept 100 racehorses would anyone think I was crazy? Not that I'm comparing children to racehorses.''</p>
        <p>There are other big questions, of course, which relate to Ms. Farrow's 11-year relationship with Woody Allen: the ugly custody battle with allegations of child abuse regarding their adopted daughter Dylan, then 6, and Mr. Allen's marriage to Ms. Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi. The subject hovers about like a rude guest who everyone wishes would leave and yet must be acknowledged.</p>
        <p>Aren't people sick of the subject? Ms. Farrow asks -- she's sick of it. She does say a few things: She tried to contact Soon-Yi but was rebuffed. None of her children have contact with Mr. Allen, by their choice. That includes the son Mr. Allen and Ms. Farrow had together, who is 12 and attends college.</p>
        <p>A happier subject seems called for. You were married, at 19, to Frank Sinatra. Most people had to put on Sinatra, you had Sinatra.</p>
        <p>''He didn't sing to me,'' Ms. Farrow says, her voice suggesting it's wearing to be a celebrity spokeswoman. ''But he was pretty terrific.''</p>
        <p>Warming up to the memory.</p>
        <p>''He would do scales, before he was going to sing some place. Jimmy Van Heusen would come over and he would vocalize, but I don't think it's the same thing as singing to some one. Did anyone ever sing to you?''</p>
        <p>Sure, lots of times.</p>
        <p>Then, ''Who?''</p>
        <p>Guys who wanted to be Sinatra.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farrow, now laughing: ''And they're free now? He was a very cool guy, he would never do anything he thought was uncool, and I think he would think singing to someone was uncool. It wasn't like he was Nelson Eddy. And God knows I was no Jeanette MacDonald.''</p>
