        <p>The prices of crude and home heating oil fell yesterday in the wake of the Clinton administration's decision last week to release 30 million barrels of oil from the nation's emergency reserve. But it still appears that this will be a difficult winter for consumers, as home heating oil and gasoline prices remain near 10-year highs.</p>
        <p>Even optimistic energy analysts do not think the added supply will rescue home heating oil users from a bitter fall and winter.</p>
        <p>''It will be tight; prices will be high,'' said Charles T. Maxwell, senior energy analyst at Weedon &amp; Company in Greenwich, Conn. ''But we will get through the winter without people freezing for a lack of fuel.''</p>
        <p>Still, he said, this means that people will be wearing sweaters and may be paying close to $2 a gallon to fill their home heating oil tanks. The East Coast retail price averaged $1.4635 a gallon last winter, with a high of $1.9470 in the first week of February, according to the Energy Information Administration. The price reached $2.1230 in New York State that week.</p>
        <p>Even with the additional oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, inventories of crude oil, which reached 24-year lows in August, are still tight. Heating oil inventories nationally, according to the energy agency, are at 48.1 billion barrels, down from 72.4 billion a year ago. On just the East Coast, heating oil inventories are 24.4 billion barrels, down from 48.5 billion a year ago. The three million to five million barrels in additional home heating oil the Clinton administration is promising would reduce that gap only slightly.</p>
        <p>The 800,000 barrels a day in increased production that OPEC promised earlier this month will not start flowing until Oct. 1, and it takes about six weeks to arrive at refineries in the United States. The crude oil from the reserve is not expected to show up as home heating oil at the retail level until the end of November or December. Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, said that the expectation of extra barrels of home heating oil assumes that refineries produce fuel at a pace above their normal rate.</p>
        <p>And things can go wrong. First, there is the weather. Last winter was unusually warm. So if this winter is just average, it will be colder, increasing the demand for home heating oil. The Energy Information Administration is projecting a 6 percent increase in consumption this winter in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>The other wild card is Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader. Iraq produces 2.3 million barrels of crude oil a day, about 4 percent of daily consumption. With the United Nations about to debate reparations for Kuwait and the approach of the expiration in December of the Iraq food-for-oil program, which allows it to sell oil to meet its country's humanitarian needs, some analysts are worried that the Iraqi leader might cut or halt production.</p>
        <p>The outlook, said Irene King, senior oil markets analyst at J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, ''depends on the weather now and Saddam.'' She said that Iraq had temporarily halted production in the past when its food-for-oil program came up for renewal.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line is that the S.P.R. sale does not change the reality of a tight supply-demand balance, with capacity constraints in both OPEC and non-OPEC nations,'' Merrill Lynch's energy team said in a bulletin on the effect of the release of the 30 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>
        <p>But despite questions on the impact of the extra oil from the reserve, the announcement on Friday did affect prices. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of crude oil for November delivery dropped $1.11, or 3.4 percent, to $31.57. The price of home heating oil for October delivery fell 1.41 cents, or 1.5 percent, to 94.07 cents a gallon.</p>
        <p>The price of unleaded gasoline for October delivery fell 1.26 cents, or 1.3 percent, to 92.70 cents a gallon. Much of the crude oil from the petroleum reserve will go into the production of more gasoline and diesel fuel. Mr. Richardson said on Friday that this action ''will likely benefit everyone who drives a car.''</p>
        <p>The average price of retail regular unleaded gasoline nationally hit a high of $1.681 a gallon in June. While it fell to $1.447 a gallon in August, it is rising again as the strong economy and the popularity of low-mileage vehicles like sport utility vehicles are keeping demand strong. The price for the week ended yesterday was $1.548 a gallon, the Energy Information Administration said.</p>
        <p>Two parts of the crude oil release helped enhance its effect, analysts said. One is that the administration released 30 million barrels of crude oil, instead of the 5 million barrels that Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, had asked for. In addition, the administration said it would review the need for oil in 30 days, which could mean another release just before Election Day on Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>''The government has taken some of the risk premium and the panic from the price,'' Ms. King said. She added that the larger amount of oil released and the threat of more would make traders who had been betting on further price increases more cautious.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maxwell said that some of the recent surge in prices, which took crude oil to $37.80 a barrel last week and home heating oil to $1.0760 a gallon two weeks ago, may be, in part, a result of both local home heating oil companies' increasing their normal reserves and homeowners filling up their tanks earlier than normal. If this is the case, then some of the normal winter pressure on home heating oil prices may have just come earlier in the season.</p>
        <p>But he is still worried about the outlook, especially because this will be a fall and winter season when the inventories and stocks of home heating oil and natural gas, the other winter fuel, will be at much lower than normal levels, in large part because of strong demand. ''It is a difficult problem when you have a lack of oil,'' he said. ''It is a double whammy when you have a lack of oil and natural gas.''</p>
        <p>The other reason that the announcement of the release of the 30 million barrels may mislead some is that very little of that crude oil ends up as home heating oil. This is because refiners cannot alter their production mix much and because there is still demand for other oil products, including gasoline and diesel fuel.</p>
        <p>According to the American Petroleum Institute, a refined barrel of oil generally produces about 45 percent gasoline and 20 percent to 25 percent, depending on the season, of distillate. Home heating oil and diesel fuel are made from distillate. The rest of the barrel is jet fuel, petrochemical stocks and the residual fuel used by utilities.</p>
        <p>Of the distillate, about one-third goes to home heating oil and two-thirds to diesel fuel. Based on this formula, about 2.5 million barrels of the 30 million would be home heating oil. The extra production the administration is counting on would bring the number into the three million to five million range.</p>
