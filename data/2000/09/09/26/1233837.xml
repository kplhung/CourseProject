        <p>Congress is close to passing legislation that the Justice Department says would legalize cruise ships' dumping of toxic chemicals from their dry cleaning and photo processing operations, offenses for which a major cruise line, Royal Caribbean, pleaded guilty last year.</p>
        <p>But the provision's Senate sponsor, Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said it would protect the environment by putting new limits on where the ships can dump waste water in Alaska. His spokesman said the provision was not meant to let  ships put chemicals like dry cleaning fluids into their waste water.</p>
        <p>An industry trade group, the International Council of Cruise Lines, said the legislation would give the Coast Guard the authority to determine whether cruise ships were living up to a voluntary agreement on when ''graywater,'' untreated water from sinks, showers and washing machines, can be released.</p>
        <p>As cruise ship numbers grow, pollution is becoming more troublesome, environmentalists say. The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, had said in February that cruise ship operations in North American ports increased by almost 50 percent between 1993 and 1998. Some ships carry 5,000 people, and produce hazardous wastes from printing, dry cleaning and film processing.</p>
        <p>''These are just giant seagoing hotels,'' said Robert C. Bundy, the United States attorney for Alaska, who said that the new legislation would make prosecutions difficult or impossible all over the United States by contradicting older laws.</p>
        <p>Among problems, according to Justice Department officials, is a provision that would allow the release of graywater if testing showed that it did not contain dry cleaning and photo processing wastes in ''amounts that would constitute a hazardous waste.'' But existing law bans any release of those chemicals, and the proposed provision could be read to allow the discharges as long as the chemicals ''were sufficiently diluted,'' according to the Justice Department. The department wants the proposal modified to prohibit the release of the chemicals.</p>
        <p>The Coast Guard said it was studying the measure, which is part of an authorization bill for the agency.</p>
        <p>Senator Murkowski's chief of staff, David K. Garman, said prosecutors were misreading the provision. ''We're not trying to allow something that's not currently allowed to happen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the governor of Alaska, Tony Knowles, a Democrat, said in a letter to Senator Murkowski on Sept. 14 that the legislation ''may cause more harm than good.''</p>
        <p>Allowing toxic chemicals to be released if diluted would be ''a significant retreat from current law, which treats the entire waste stream as hazardous waste if any hazardous waste is mixed with it,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Governor Knowles also said a new study of discharges by large cruise ships, conducted by the state and the Coast Guard, found that ''not a single sample of the sewage discharges fully complied with existing state and federal standards.''</p>
        <p>Senator Murkowski responded the next day, ''This bill passed the Senate on July 27. Now, at the 11th hour when the bill is heading to conference with the House, we finally hear from the governor.''</p>
        <p>The legislation is part of a Coast Guard authorization bill that has passed the House and Senate in slightly different forms and is expected to be the subject of a conference committee soon. The Justice Department stated its objections in a letter to the House Transportation Committee chairman, Representative Bud Shuster. But Mr. Shuster, a Republican whose landlocked Pennsylvania district does not see cruise ship traffic, will leave the issue to his colleagues from Alaska, a spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists are unhappy that the law would shift enforcement powers to the Coast Guard, which they see as more sympathetic to the industry than the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murkowski's provision was introduced while the Coast Guard was holding hearings in Alaska on how cruise ships should be regulated, a process that Clinton administration officials would like to see completed before Congress acts. At the International Council of Cruise Lines, J. Michael Crye, the acting president, acknowledged that making new law while the E.P.A., the state and the industry are trying to develop new regulations was ''a legitimate criticism of this legislation.''</p>
        <p>But he said that the legislation would not loosen any existing rules, and that the industry was trying to reduce pollution. The industry's voluntary code of practices and procedures is posted on its Web site, www.iccl.org/publicinfo/index.html.</p>
        <p>Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, the second-largest cruise line, pleaded guilty in July 1999, and agreed to an $18 million fine. Its offenses included dumping hazardous chemicals into graywater, and making false statements to the Coast Guard.</p>
