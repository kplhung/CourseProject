        <p>During his 13 years in power, Slobodan Milosevic has lost piece after piece of his country. His Serbian nationalism and demagoguery ended in the independence of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, their borders drawn in blood.

        <p>While the government is still insisting that its partial count gives Mr. Milosevic 45 percent to Vojislav Kostunica's 40 percent, the more credible vote count carried out by opposition election monitors shows an overwhelming opposition victory, despite widespread reports of government vote-rigging. Mr. Kostunica, according to this tally, has 55 percent, 21 points more than Mr. Milosevic and enough to avoid a second round of balloting. The European Union, Germany, Britain, France and Italy all urged Mr. Milosevic to accept defeat, while the United States said yesterday that it appeared he would lose.</p>

        <p>During his 13 years in power, Slobodan Milosevic has lost piece after piece of his country. His Serbian nationalism and demagoguery ended in the independence of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, their borders drawn in blood. Today Macedonia is independent, Kosovo is under United Nations control and Serbia's sister republic, Montenegro, has seceded in all but name. Mr. Milosevic is left with only Serbia, and after Sunday's elections, Serbia is no longer his.</p>
        <p>While the government is still insisting that its partial count gives Mr. Milosevic 45 percent to Vojislav Kostunica's 40 percent, the more credible vote count carried out by opposition election monitors shows an overwhelming opposition victory, despite widespread reports of government vote-rigging. Mr. Kostunica, according to this tally, has 55 percent, 21 points more than Mr. Milosevic and enough to avoid a second round of balloting. The European Union, Germany, Britain, France and Italy all urged Mr. Milosevic to accept defeat, while the United States said yesterday that it appeared he would lose.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Kostunica expected to come out ahead, the opposition did not expect the large margin of victory, or its success in municipal elections. Turnout was high, with nearly 70 percent of registered voters casting ballots. Several of Mr. Milosevic's powerful allies have defected from his side.  Government officials, who seemed to have made the mistake of swallowing their own propaganda, seemed stunned. Word of the defeat is seeping through the army and security forces, which may make them less likely to enforce a fraudulent result. Whether or not he acknowledges defeat, this election is surely the beginning of Mr. Milosevic's demise.</p>
        <p>So far, Yugoslav authorities have been stalling, announcing no official results. It appears likely that the government will stick with the claim that a runoff in two weeks is necessary. By that time, presumably, Mr. Milosevic will have his fraud better organized, and he might even make one last try at rallying nationalist sentiment by attacking Montenegro or staging an act of violence he can attribute to his enemies. As a backup, Mr. Milosevic's aides are maintaining that even if he has lost this election, he is entitled to stay as Yugoslavia's president until his term ends next summer.</p>
        <p>The opposition should be wary of a runoff. Its leaders plan to hold a new round of rallies tonight in various cities. After Mr. Milosevic lost local elections in 1996, three months of large street demonstrations forced him to acknowledge those defeats. Although in the last few years the opposition has drawn sparse crowds, its energy and electoral victory should prove a bigger attraction now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica should reject deals that allow Mr. Milosevic to retain power behind the scenes. Even if Mr. Milosevic decides to accept defeat, he will negotiate every step that trims his power. Mr. Kostunica should not start by making concessions. It would only undercut his goal of making Serbia a modern and democratic nation.</p>
