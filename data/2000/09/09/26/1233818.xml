        <p>AN agency that had not initially been identified as a participant in one of the year's biggest reviews landed the assignment yesterday.</p>
        <p>The review was for the corporate account of the Kmart Corporation, the troubled retailer seeking to reverse its flagging fortunes under a new chairman and chief executive, Charles C. Conaway. The assignment, with billing estimated at $100 million, was awarded to the New York office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, effective at the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The review for the Kmart account, handled for more than five years by Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis, began in late June. In early August, the retailer named seven finalists, but identified only six; the seventh was not disclosed by ''mutual agreement,'' Kmart said at the time. Soon after, the trade publication Adweek identified the seventh finalist as TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA unit of the Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>The decision means that Kmart is dismissing Campbell Mithun, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, which created campaigns featuring celebrities like the singing Judd family, the director Penny Marshall, the talk show host Rosie O'Donnell and, in a one-time cameo appearance, the comedian Bob Hope.</p>
        <p>The switch makes Kmart the second major national retailer to dismiss its agency this year, coming after the J. C. Penney Company left Temerlin McClain in Irving, Tex., part of True North Communications, for offices of DDB Worldwide, also owned by Omnicom.</p>
        <p>Together, Kmart and TBWA/ Chiat/Day New York ''will build a powerful, consistent and complete communication plan that leverages the Kmart brand, drives sales and strives to create a sustainable emotional bond with our customers,'' Mr. Conaway said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Carl Johnson, president and chief executive of TBWA/Chiat/Day New York, called Kmart ''an American institution with unrealized potential.''</p>
        <p>Actually, Kmart realized its potential in the 1970's and 1980's, growing into a powerful national discount retailer, only to lose its way in the 1990's amid intensifying competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the Target chain owned by the company now known as the Target Corporation.</p>
        <p>Beginning in mid-1995, Kmart undertook a corporate makeover under a previous chairman, Floyd Hall, who pushed to introduce larger stores under the Big K name and update the dowdy image of Kmart's merchandise through a licensing agreement with the style doyenne Martha Stewart and the creation of Kmart brands like Route 66 apparel.</p>
        <p>But problems with outdated technology that hindered the proper management of inventories have impeded Kmart's growth, leading to two consecutive quarters of earnings lower than analysts had estimated.</p>
        <p>At one point yesterday, the price of Kmart shares on the New York Stock Exchange fell to $5.06, their lowest level in at least 20 years. They recovered a bit to close at $5.38, down 38 cents.</p>
        <p>''Our contributions to Kmart's business over the past five years have been incredible,'' Les Mouser, president and chief operating officer at Campbell Mithun, said in a memo sent to employees, ''especially in light of Kmart's continuing challenge to resolve the serious operational and in-store issues that plague its business.''</p>
        <p>Campbell Mithun will create ads for Kmart through the important holiday shopping season. The first work from TBWA/Chiat/Day New York is expected to appear in the first quarter of 2001.</p>
        <p>Neither Kmart nor TBWA/Chiat/ Day New York would discuss why the agency was not originally listed among the review finalists. There was some speculation the mystery was related to another retail account handled by the agency, Circuit City Stores, which hired TBWA/Chiat/ Day New York in August to work on its account, with billings estimated at $60 million to $75 million.</p>
        <p>Jim Babb, a spokesman for Circuit City in Richmond, Va., said late yesterday: ''We don't have a big problem with that because of the size of Chiat and also because Kmart is a general retailer, not in direct conflict with us. As a matter of fact, Chiat conferred with our senior management ahead of time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson agreed that the Kmart account did not represent a conflict with Circuit City, adding that the office would handle both clients.</p>
        <p>Landing Kmart is ''hugely significant for us,'' Mr. Johnson said, adding that additional employees would probably be hired as a result.</p>
        <p>The two freelancers who were named last week to share the top creative post at TBWA/Chiat/Day New York as executive creative directors, Dallas Itzen and Patrick O'Neill, ''led the work internally and presented to the client,'' Mr. Johnson said, adding that they would ''take a very strong personal role on this account.'' Ms. Itzen and Mr. O'Neill succeeded David Page, who was dismissed after 18 months as chief creative officer.</p>
        <p>The other finalists in the review, in addition to Campbell Mithun and TBWA/Chiat/Day New York, were: the Chicago office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications; Grey Worldwide in New York, part of the Grey Global Group; J. Walter Thompson in New York, part of the WPP Group; Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic; and Temerlin McClain, the former Penney agency.</p>
        <p>There was some confusion as to whether the decision was made from among all seven finalists or whether the review had been narrowed further. In his memo to employees, Mr. Mouser wrote that the decision ''came down from seven agencies to just Chiat and us.'' The trade publication Advertising Age, in its issue that came out yesterday, reported that the review ''appears to have narrowed'' to Lowe Lintas and TBWA/Chiat/Day New York.</p>
        <p>However, Mary Lorencz, a spokeswoman for Kmart, which is based in Troy, Mich., said: ''We started with seven agencies and ended with seven. All seven made presentations to the company.''</p>
