        <p>Whatever the deficiencies of the new Broadway production of ''The Best Man,'' Gore Vidal's 1960 take on presidential politics, it draws attention to the rhetorical flatness and general humorlessness of the current political contests. Viewers looking for some semblance of wit or cleverness find a crop of stock phrases and standard gestures. Epigrams are outlawed and the language is as strictly restricted as immigration law lest some intended drollery slip in. Perhaps the candidates have learned from Mr. Vidal's shaky political career that being clever is not a route to electoral popularity.</p>
        <p>More happily for the author, ''The Best Man'' was a hit at its opening, and despite some reservations by a new set of critics, several have noted that this play, with its characters resembling Nixon, Stevenson and Truman and with its allusions to campaign charges of closet homosexuality and mental instability, remains stingingly pertinent.</p>
        <p>There have been candidates, from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan, who could deliver a put-down in an engaging way. Roosevelt's throwaway line about the Republican attack on his little dog Fala and Mr. Reagan's assurance in his debate with Walter F. Mondale that he would not take advantage of that youth's inexperience remain small classics. But in recent years the main entertainment offered by candidates comes from their own pratfalls: Dan Quayle trying to spell; Gerald R. Ford trying to walk down a flight of steps without tripping; Michael S. Dukakis wearing an ill-fitting helmet and riding around in a tank. And, of course, there is Al Gore's changeable wardrobe and George W. Bush's pronunciation problems. Funny but not witty.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Vidal cracks in his play, ''Irony is un-American.'' Whether we live in a kinder, gentler political time is a matter of opinion, but we surely live in a more inhibited era than the one when political slanging was in fashion. Nineteenth-century politicking bubbled with wholesome vulgarities and awful insults. These days you can never be sure when a crack about a candidate is likely to offend some constituency; Rick A. Lazio is being charged with insufficient gallantry toward women for his rough treatment of Hillary Rodham Clinton in their first debate. But then no one has accused either of them of  being a fount of humor.</p>
        <p>The rule these days, as laid down by Morris K. Udall in his book ''Too Funny to Be President,'' published by Henry Holt in 1988, gives a notion of what things have come to: ''Effective humor is never cruel, ridiculing or belittling. Ideally, it should be gentle, nudging at weakness rather than exploiting a glaring personal shortcoming.'' That's enough to get a voter in search of a laugh to change channels.</p>
        <p>In the words of one of Mr. Vidal's characters, ''Life isn't a popularity contest; neither is politics.'' When candidates try to be funny they mostly play it safe with a self-deprecatory quip. After his narrow victory in 1960, John F. Kennedy, one of the more sophisticated American presidents, showed the way in a speech by creating a telegram from his father: ''Dear Jack, don't buy a single vote more than is necessary. I'll be damned if I'm going to pay for a landslide.''</p>
        <p>The great exception in recent years has been Bob Dole, not that it has done his career much good. His naturally acerbic tendency had to be quelled when he was campaigning, but he still left behind some rich moments, as when he included in his Top 10 list for budget balancing: ''Arkansas -- sell it!'' And of course it was Mr. Dole who described a reunion of ex-presidents, Carter, Ford and Nixon, as ''See no evil, hear no evil and evil.''</p>
        <p>Like environmentalists who have never met a species that did not require protection, political scriptwriters today guard the sensibilities of all races and religions, of all ages, handicaps and sexual preferences lest their candidate be brought up on charges of offensiveness. The wonder is that Mr. Bush's references to Mr. Gore's fund-raising haven't aroused an outcry from the Buddhist antidefamation league.</p>
        <p>But much else has changed in American electioneering in this century. As Neal Gabler, a close observer of Hollywood, described the boring result in an article in The Los Angeles Times in 1996: ''Campaigns are no longer rowdy festivals where hotblooded candidates ignite the faithful to action -- at least not winning campaigns. They are cool media performances where a successful candidate must convince the electorate he is basically harmless, middle of the road and thus unthreateningly Presidential.''</p>
        <p>It often seems that a deficiency of humor is a criterion of casting a candidate. The report that Mrs. Clinton has taken to being more congenial on the campaign trail, actually going so far as to share a cup of coffee with folks, might suggest a want of spontaneity on the stump. In public she remains largely concealed behind the safe phrases about children, health and Newt Gingrich that have so far constituted her message. Spontaneity is risky; left on her own for a moment and she may be caught kissing Yasir Arafat's wife.</p>
        <p>Her opponent has responded in kind, with his own phrases about character and trust and who is the more authentic New Yorker and softer on soft money. Their opening debate was sufficiently contentious, but the notion of either making a joke, even a scripted one, is hard to imagine. Mrs. Clinton would probably muff the punch line, and jokes run smack against Mr. Lazio's quest for gravitas. For both the New York Senate aspirants, a glimpse of frivolity would undermine their perspiring presumptions to high seriousness or inviolable earnestness though it would surely make for a zippier show.</p>
        <p>The only national candidate who evidently relishes telling jokes is Joseph I. Lieberman; he sends forth one-liners with zest, as though he had actually written them. But the humor is never too close to the bone, and Mr. Lieberman further safeguards himself by inoculating his speeches with assertions of reverence. Still, the Democrat is capable of getting a laugh from a friendly audience, which is more than Dick Cheney can manage. The Republican seems bent on maintaining his reputation as a candidate unsmudged by any show of personality, much less humor. He is surely among the least vivid political candidate in a national race.</p>
        <p>The presidential candidates, too, are careful onstage. Mr. Bush especially has to watch his step because his natural taste in humor is reputedly fraternity high jinks, which is not likely to serve him this time around. Mr. Gore, whose problem has been a seeming stolidity, is straining to be a regular guy on television shows, where he can chat it up with the Letterman-Leno-Winfrey gang. In the contest for the women's vote, Mr. Bush has followed Mr. Gore onto ''Oprah,'' where he confessed to liking peanut butter sandwiches and actually got a laugh.</p>
        <p>Tough reviewers may see these exercises in charm as condescending comments on the female audience's intellectual level, but no complaints have been registered. In a week the two men will have their first debate. If you're looking for political wit, try the Virginia Theater.</p>
