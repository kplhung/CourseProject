        <p>New York Republicans, faced with a set of pivotal legislative races in November, are running campaigns that are increasingly at odds with the policies of their party's presidential nominee, George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>The positions they are staking out, even  on hot-button issues like tax cuts, prescription drug coverage and gun control, make them sound a lot like the Democrats who are trying to unseat them.</p>
        <p>''The things we are talking about on the campaign trail are not part of the national Republican playbook,'' said Michael Balboni, a Republican state senator from Long Island who is facing a challenge this year.</p>
        <p>A senior Republican strategist who works in the State Legislature said the contrast was in the tone of the Bush and the State Senate campaigns. ''When you look at the Republican national platform, it is not really very helpful to us,'' the strategist said. ''It's much more conservative than we want to be. It's not as conservative as it was four years ago, but it's clearly a platform that was not drafted with New York in mind.''</p>
        <p>The stakes are high this year. New York Republicans are worried that Mr. Bush's sizable deficit in state polls may be a sign  that their own supporters will not turn out on Election Day, a concern that has deepened with the likelihood of a strong Democratic turnout resulting from the mounting statewide popularity of the Democrats' national ticket.</p>
        <p>Even Gov. George E. Pataki is not spending his time campaigning in his home state for Mr. Bush. Instead, Mr. Bush tapped Mr. Pataki this week to make a series of appearances in five other states where Mr. Bush is running close.</p>
        <p>Republicans with tough legislative races in New York do see some reason for hope on the ballot this year. They believe that their chances will be bolstered by a strong showing by Representative Rick A. Lazio, their party's candidate for United States Senate, as well as by the antipathy many voters feel toward his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>Perhaps state Republicans' biggest break has been with Mr. Bush's $1.3 trillion tax cut plan. Senator Balboni said that in his district, voters attached greater importance to health care and environmental issues than to a tax cut as large as the one Mr. Bush is proposing. He said there was ''dampening enthusiasm'' for a cut as large as Mr. Bush's.</p>
        <p>''In my district, constituents will support a tax cut so long as it doesn't endanger government services,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Guy J. Velella, a Republican senator who is also the party leader in the Bronx, said talk of large tax cuts was ''mumbo jumbo'' to voters.</p>
        <p>He said his plan was not so much to distance himself from Mr. Bush, but rather to avoid relying on anyone else. ''We don't win our seats because of the top of the ticket,'' he said, adding, ''I run my campaign as Guy Velella.''</p>
        <p>Other senators said they believed that voters generally prefer more narrowly tailored tax cuts, like the ones the Republicans championed in the last state legislative session, including a deduction for the cost of college tuition and a reduction in the state's utility tax.</p>
        <p>Tax cuts aimed at segments of voters are major themes of Vice President Al Gore and Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Republicans in Albany began to lay the groundwork for their blur-the-party-lines strategy earlier this year. The Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, passed a flurry of legislation that the party once fiercely resisted, seeking to deprive Democrats of issues to use against them in the general election while giving Republican lawmakers a list of major accomplishments. In each case, the legislation was meant to appeal to moderate voters in New York City and its suburbs, where the most vulnerable Republican senators are based.</p>
        <p>So while the Bush campaign took months before it endorsed a plan to provide prescription drug coverage for the elderly, Republicans in the State Senate can boast that their plan was signed into law months ago. While the national Republican platform opposes abortion, many state Republicans are pointing proudly to a new law that protects abortion clinics from obstruction. And while the national Republican Party is a strong ally of the National Rifle Association, the state senators can cite a law enacted this summer that  toughens restrictions on gun owners.</p>
        <p>Democrats acknowledge that Republicans have done a good job positioning themselves this year. But they argue that Republicans have long resisted acting on issues like gun control, and would not have done so this year if they had not anticipated a tough re-election fight.</p>
        <p>Lorraine Coyle Koppell, a lawyer who is challenging Mr. Velella in the Bronx, said she intended to remind voters that her opponent and his Republican colleagues in the Senate ''were dragged kicking and screaming'' into adopting bills they once opposed.</p>
        <p>''The leopard doesn't change his spots,'' she said. ''This is still the Republican Party of George W. Bush. Where has the leadership of the Republican Party been for the last 10 years? These bills should have been passed over the last 10 years.''</p>
        <p>The state Republicans are particularly worried about protecting their majority in the Senate, where a shift of six seats would change the balance of power for the first time in decades. Democrats, who already control the State Assembly, have pledged to spend enough money to give 13 Republican incumbents competitive races.</p>
        <p>The nervousness among the Republicans has been heightened by a surprising defeat they were dealt last year. Voters in Nassau County, a Republican bastion, gave Democrats control of the County Legislature for the first time in 80 years because of Nassau's severe fiscal problems. The Democrats are mounting strong challenges against the five Republican senators from Nassau, hoping that the backlash against Republicans will continue.</p>
        <p>That said, Democrats have considerable hurdles to overcome if they expect to win seats in the Senate, including the many advantages of incumbency that Republicans now enjoy, such as taxpayer-financed mailings to their districts, large staffs to handle complaints from constituents and a fund-raising edge that comes with being in the majority.</p>
        <p>State Republicans say that they had hoped that even if Mr. Bush could not prevail in New York, his campaign would inspire Republican voters and might help their candidates win. Instead, many Republicans say they now fear being swamped by a huge Democratic turnout for Mr. Gore. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows Mr. Gore ahead nearly two to one.</p>
        <p>In an interview last week on WROW-AM radio in Albany, Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader in the Senate, acknowledged the potential trouble Mr. Bush's sagging popularity in New York poses for him and his Senate colleagues.</p>
        <p>''Sure, we're worried,'' said Mr. Bruno, who controls the Republican majority's political operation and campaign committee. But, he added: ''Coattails aren't what they used to be. We think that people will recognize our individual senators and the outstanding job they have done.''</p>
        <p>In that context, Republican state lawmakers and their strategists say they have been aggressively developing their own campaign advertisements and fliers in recent months instead of featuring Mr. Bush, or even using his campaign pitch of compassionate conservatism, as many had once considered doing.</p>
        <p>Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican senator from Westchester County who is facing a potentially competitive race this year, made it clear in a recent interview that he would seek to distance himself from Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''It should be no surprise to anyone that the members of the Senate majority are running their own campaign,'' he said. ''No one's being disloyal. Everyone's being practical.''</p>
        <p>Carl L. Marcellino, a Republican senator from Nassau County, said party leaders had urged him and his colleagues to ''run aggressive and very independent campaigns so that we develop reputations beyond party labels.''</p>
        <p>To that end, he said, he has emphasized his work on behalf of the environment, education and narrowly tailored tax cuts, such as allowing tuition deductions. ''Politics is a funny business,'' he said. ''If George W. Bush suddenly surges, you may see changes in strategy and advertising. But not now.''</p>
        <p>Then he added: ''I still think that George Bush is a moderate. But for whatever reason, his message is not catching on at this moment in New York.''</p>
