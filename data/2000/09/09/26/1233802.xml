        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I find it difficult to sympathize with Ann L. Berrios as she unfavorably compares her family's wealth with her more affluent neighbors' (''No Wealth of Opportunity,'' Op-Ed, Sept. 25).</p>
        <p>Surely she realizes that she falls within the upper echelon of those in this country. Her children go to one of the best school districts in the country, she has health and dental insurance and is able to buy food (including pastry on her way to work) and pay all her bills. Maybe if she volunteered at a local soup kitchen, she would understand what real poverty is and be more content with her own lifestyle.</p>
