        <p>Mayor Anthony A. Williams, backed by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Eleanor Holmes Norton, this city's nonvoting Congressional delegate, today urged the reopening of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House, calling it a ''visual blight'' to ''America's Main Street.''</p>
        <p>The street was closed after the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, but Mr. Williams unveiled an architectural plan by the firm of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill and a security study by the Rand Corporation that he said showed a  way to safeguard the president and those working at the White House.</p>
        <p>The key element would be solid pedestrian bridges that would permit access by cars and even by sport utility vehicles less than 7 feet, 6 inches high -- but not trucks like the one used in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.</p>
        <p>The proposal also calls for narrowing the avenue, which once held eight lanes of traffic, to four lanes and bowing it away from the White House -- drawn from a design once suggested by Thomas Jefferson.</p>
        <p>The Secret Service was cool to the proposal. ''We are agreeable to sit down with anybody on this issue to hear anyone's proposal and concerns,'' said Jim Mackin, a Secret Service spokesman.</p>
        <p>He said the agency had received a summary of the proposal and added that from ''what we have seen so far, in our opinion, the same vulnerabilities exist that led to the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue.''</p>
        <p>''However, we have not received the full report at this point to further evaluate the proposal,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A meeting involving the proponents, the Secret Service and Lawrence H. Summers, secretary of the treasury, which oversees the Secret Service, will be held later this week, government officials said.</p>
        <p>But Delegate Norton and Senator Moynihan were each sharply critical of the Secret Service this morning.</p>
        <p>Ms. Norton called it a ''secret police,'' and said it ''operates with tunnel vision, considering security almost alone, not other American values or the American people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moynihan, the retiring senior senator from New York who has worked to develop Pennsylvania Avenue for four decades, said the service pursued the impossible goal of ''zero risk,'' and would accept this plan ''if they have any reason left to them at all.''</p>
        <p>The plan was put together by the Federal City Council, a private, nonprofit business-supported organization. Its president, former Senator Bob Dole, issued a statement saying, ''The closed section of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House not only symbolizes giving in to our fear of terrorism, but it has resulted in literally cutting in half the downtown of the nation's Capital.''</p>
        <p>He said that ''fundamental American values, such as openness and accessibility, must not be sacrificed for the sake of security.''</p>
        <p>The two major party presidential candidates -- one of whom will be in a position to decide what to do --  reacted with cautious support.</p>
        <p>Doug Hattaway, Vice President Al Gore's spokesman, said Mr. Gore ''would like to look into reopening Pennsylvania Avenue and would look forward to reviewing the proposal.''</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said that if elected, Mr. Bush ''would meet with the Secret Service to get their best judgment on the implications of opening up Pennsylvania Avenue. He is keenly aware of the sensitivities in Washington, D.C., to the problems that have been created by the closing.''</p>
        <p>The Republican Party platform promises, ''We will reopen Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House as a symbolic expression of our confidence in the restoration of the rule of law.'' The Democratic platform is silent on the subject.</p>
        <p>The official White House response, first reported today by The Washington Post, did not deal with any concerns other than security.</p>
        <p>Elliot Diringer, the White House deputy press secretary, said: ''The safety of the president, the first family and visitors, as well as the protection of America's first home, are paramount concerns. We have had a preliminary briefing from the Federal City Council and we have asked them to brief Secretary Summers and the Secret Service. We look forward to receiving the details of their proposal and considering the views of Congresswoman Norton and Senator Moynihan.''</p>
        <p>The Rand study argued that the reshaped and narrowed avenue, the pedestrian bridges and state-of-the-art detection technology ''could achieve the goal of securing the president's personal protection from catastrophic truck bomb threats while still remaining true to the principles of open access and unrestricted movement around our nation's most important historical landmarks.'' The study said the Secret Service and the Treasury Department had been unwilling to meet with the study authors, who got their security information from the F.B.I. instead.</p>
        <p>Security and openness are not the only issues. Terence Golden, chairman of the Federal City Council, said the closing of the main east-west thoroughfare ''is strangling our transportation and our economy.''</p>
        <p>Harvey Joyner of the Parsons Transportation Group said the avenue used to carry 29,000 vehicles a day, which have been diverted to other streets.</p>
        <p>The traffic-free area in front of the White House is now used by pedestrians, skateboarders and roller-hockey players. The tour buses that once idled there now park on the other side of Lafayette Park.</p>
        <p>Another change made in 1995, blocking 13,000 vehicles a day from westbound lanes on E Street south of the White House, ends this fall when reconstruction of the street further from the White House is completed.</p>
