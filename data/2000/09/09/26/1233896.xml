        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>One missing ingredient in ''Fitness Gap Is America's Recipe for Fat Youth'' (Sept. 19) is too much unhealthy food. Children's sedentary habits no doubt have contributed greatly to the sharp upswing in childhood obesity, but eating super-size portions of unhealthy foods is an equal contributor.</p>
        <p>I agree that parents should be role models, make fitness a priority for the family and encourage children to engage in enjoyable physical activities. But I also suggest that parents apply similar strategies to food: set the example by eating more healthy foods and less junk, provide children with an abundance of nutritious food and encourage them to make better decisions about what and how much they eat and drink.</p>

        <p>If parents follow this advice, perhaps we can not only avert obesity among our youth, but raise physically and emotionally healthier children.</p>
