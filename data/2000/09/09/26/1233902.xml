        <p>The pressure is off the Mets for the three-game series that begins tonight against Atlanta, but it is not. The first- and second-place teams in the National League East will play games that are not that important, but they are very important. The Mets are so close to advancing to the postseason that they can feel October, but they are not officially excited about anything just yet.</p>
        <p>Does this make sense? It should. The Mets are in a safe position, because they are one victory away from securing the wild-card berth and qualifying for the playoffs for the second consecutive season. The Braves cannot destroy the Mets in the next three days. If the Dodgers and the Arizona Diamondbacks each lose one game before the Mets can win one, the Mets would ease into the postseason that way, too. Continuing into October is basically an afterthought for the Mets.</p>

        <p>The pressure is off the Mets for the three-game series that begins tonight against Atlanta, but it is not. The first- and second-place teams in the National League East will play games that are not that important, but they are very important. The Mets are so close to advancing to the postseason that they can feel October, but they are not officially excited about anything just yet.</p>
        <p>Does this make sense? It should. The Mets are in a safe position, because they are one victory away from securing the wild-card berth and qualifying for the playoffs for the second consecutive season. The Braves cannot destroy the Mets in the next three days. If the Dodgers and the Arizona Diamondbacks each lose one game before the Mets can win one, the Mets would ease into the postseason that way, too. Continuing into October is basically an afterthought for the Mets.</p>
        <p>So how should the Mets view this series with Atlanta? Obviously, they still have a slim chance to pass the Braves and that is what they are focusing on. But it seems unlikely that the Mets will be able to erase a four-game deficit with only six games left in the regular season, especially against a Braves team that has dominated them in winning eight straight division titles.</p>
        <p>''There is a pride factor and I want to rub their nose in a little Shea dirt starting tomorrow,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine playfully told about 200 fans while signing autographs at a Manhattan sports event last evening. ''That should be on the 11 o'clock news.''</p>
        <p>By Thursday night, the Mets will have finished an intense period in which they played the Braves six times in 11 days. The Mets were a fragile team after losing the first two games at Turner Field last week, and they would need a three-game sweep to have a shot at overtaking Atlanta. Winning two of three would leave the Mets three games back with three games left, meaning the best they could do is tie for first at the conclusion of the regular season.</p>
        <p>''I still think, if and when we clinch, you have to assume that the Braves will be a team, like every other year, you have to go through to get to the World Series,'' said Al Leiter, who beat the Braves last week and opposes John Burkett tonight. ''Therefore, the series is important whether we have a chance to win the division or not, to just show ourselves that we can play with them and beat them.''</p>
        <p>There is plenty to motivate the Mets. They have lost 20 of their last 23 contests at Turner Field, they lost the National League Championship Series in six valiant games last year and they have finished second to Atlanta for two straight years.</p>
        <p>Leiter was on the World Series champion Florida Marlins in 1997. He has often talked about how the Marlins did not fear the Braves in the N.L.C.S., because they had beaten them 8 times in 12 regular-season games. Leiter stressed the importance of simply feeling comfortable against the Braves. Comfort breeds confidence.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't a far-fetched dream that we could beat these guys,'' Leiter said of the Marlins' attitude toward the Braves that season. He then shifted back to the Mets and said, ''We match up pretty well with them, but we have to be really on to beat these guys.''</p>
        <p>If the Braves win two of the three games in New York, they would clinch the division title in the Mets' backyard. Valentine snapped on Sunday when he was asked about witnessing this potential scene at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>''We're in this for us,'' Valentine said. ''We're in this to do the best we can. That's what we're in this for. We do that, and we don't have to worry about any other topics of conversation.''</p>
        <p>Leiter said he was thinking about winning three games against Atlanta, not about delaying a celebration. Benny Agbayani bowed his head when the possibility was broached of seeing the Joneses (Chipper and Andruw) and the other Braves dance at Shea.</p>
        <p>''We don't want that to happen,'' Agbayani said, ''especially against this team.''</p>
        <p>By winning four of their last five games, the Mets seem to have righted themselves and erased some of the stench from another September swoon. Mike Piazza is 8 for 16 with 3 homers and 7 runs batted in over this span, and Todd Zeile is 6 for 16 with 3 homers and 5 R.B.I. Darryl Hamilton said the Mets were more confident than they have been all month.</p>
        <p>''We still think we have enough to win it all,'' Hamilton said. ''Anything less than winning it all would be a disappointment.''</p>
        <p>If the Mets sweep the Braves this week and crawl within one game of first place, Valentine would have some interesting decisions to make in the last three games against the Montreal Expos. Would the manager concentrate on winning the division or would he be more concerned about resting Piazza and limiting his starting pitchers?</p>
        <p>Valentine indicated that he would probably not rest any players because the Mets would get at least Monday and Tuesday or Monday and Wednesday as days off during the first week of the division series. But, for Valentine to even have to contemplate these decisions, the Mets must make a miraculous run at the Braves.</p>
        <p>''Four down with six to go, that's tough,'' Valentine said. ''But that's what we have.''</p>
