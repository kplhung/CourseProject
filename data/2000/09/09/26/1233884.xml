        <p>For the last month, New Jerseyans have hardly been able to avoid hearing about the virtues of Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic multimillionaire who has spent more than $1 million a week on television advertising for his Senate campaign. With only six weeks to go before the November election, his underfinanced Republican opponent, Representative Bob Franks, has yet to broadcast a single commercial.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, however, a Washington group that has ties to moderate Republicans like Gov.

        <p>For the last month, New Jerseyans have hardly been able to avoid hearing about the virtues of Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic multimillionaire who has spent more than $1 million a week on television advertising for his Senate campaign. With only six weeks to go before the November election, his underfinanced Republican opponent, Representative Bob Franks, has yet to broadcast a single commercial.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, however, a Washington group that has ties to moderate Republicans like Gov. Christine Todd Whitman came to Mr. Franks's rescue with a radio ad criticizing his rival's recent missteps on the campaign trail. The group paying for the ad, the Republican Leadership Council, said it would broadcast more radio and television advertisements in the next few weeks to help defeat Mr. Corzine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine got some outside help of his own yesterday, as the nonprofit consumer group New Jersey Citizen Action criticized Mr. Franks for ''failing the citizens of New Jersey on important health, environmental, trade and workplace safety issues.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference outside Mr. Franks's office in Union, N.J., the group said that in surveying his voting record in Congress, they found that he earned a score of 33 out of 100 for his votes on issues affecting consumers and the elderly. The group echoed the line in Mr. Corzine's recent television ads, which have criticized Mr. Franks's voting record on Medicare and other health issues.</p>
        <p>Citizen Action denounced the congressman's vote for a bill that would offer prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries through private insurance companies and H.M.O.'s rather than through the Medicare program. The group said the bill, which was defeated, would have unnecessarily forced many elderly people into H.M.O.'s.</p>
        <p>Peter DeMarco a spokesman for the congressman, said the consumer group, like Mr. Corzine, has been distorting Mr. Franks's record. For example, he said, they have given the impression that he voted to cut Medicare spending, when in fact he voted on reductions in future Medicare and Medicaid spending.</p>
        <p>''They know full well they're not giving voters the full story,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Republican group's new radio ad tries to capitalize on Mr. Corzine's campaign troubles of the last few weeks, when he has been on the defensive about his finances and his charitable giving.  Mr. Corzine has also resisted pressure from Mr. Franks and others to release his personal tax returns.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Corzine disclosed that his family's charitable foundation had given more than $100,000 to groups whose leaders or sponsors later endorsed him. The foundation has also donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to groups that wield political influence of one kind or another, like the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark and Planned Parenthood of Northern New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine denied that the gifts were used to buy influence. But just a few days ago he incorrectly told a group of college students, in a program taped for television, that one widely questioned gift had been made before he became a candidate. In fact, he had pledged the donation after he had formed an exploratory committee, and actually made the donation three months after declaring his candidacy.</p>
        <p>The radio ad takes him to task for his changing his story. ''Money can buy multimillionaire Jon Corzine a lot, but it can't buy New Jersey's trust,'' a woman's voice says in the 60-second ad that will be heard in the Philadelphia and New York City areas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's campaign took issue with the ad, saying it focused on an issue that was of greater interest ''to those in the political community and the media than voters are.''</p>
        <p>''It's a sign of the desperation of the Franks campaign,'' said Tom Shea, Mr. Corzine's spokesman.</p>
        <p>The Republican Leadership Council would not say how much it planned to spend to broadcast more ads.</p>
        <p>''We will disclose how much we'll spend when Jon Corzine releases his tax returns,'' said Matt Well, communications director for the group.</p>
