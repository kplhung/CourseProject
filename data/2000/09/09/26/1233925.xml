        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''There's No Shortage of Repositioning on Oil'' (Week in Review, Sept. 24):</p>
        <p>You say ''the approach of a presidential election has a way of altering the way candidates parse the laws of supply and demand,'' in explaining Vice President Al Gore's reluctance to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve last winter and his proposal to do so last week -- a proposal that President Clinton has acted on. This statement misses two important points.</p>
        <p>First, crude and home heating oil inventories in the United States are dramatically lower than anyone forecast six months ago, meaning a high likelihood not only of severe price spikes this winter but also shortages in supply.</p>
        <p>Second, the primary reason the Clinton administration was reluctant to release oil from the strategic reserve last winter was the concern that OPEC would cut its output by any amount we released. But with global oil prices approaching $40 a barrel earlier this month, Saudi Arabia made it clear that it would not support any action that would undercut America's own release of oil.</p>
        <p>The change in inventory levels and in the Saudis' attitude has made the argument to release some oil from the strategic reserve more compelling.</p>
        <p>CHARLES E. SCHUMER  U.S. Senator from New York  Washington, Sept. 25, 2000</p>
