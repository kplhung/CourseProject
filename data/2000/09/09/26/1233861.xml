        <p>The discovery of an unapproved variety of genetically engineered corn in a brand of store-bought taco shells is prompting new calls for the labeling of bioengineered foods.</p>
        <p>But the case, which led Kraft Foods to announce a nationwide recall on Friday, also offers a foretaste of some of the practical difficulties involved in such labeling. Among the questions are the reliability of testing, the degree to which conventional grains and foods can feasibly be kept separate from those that are genetically modified, and even the definition of genetically modified food.</p>
        <p>Such issues are already confronting the European Union, Australia, Japan and other countries that already require labeling or are moving toward it, with different countries, or even different supermarkets in the same country, adopting different standards.</p>
        <p>In the United States, where about two-thirds of processed food contains ingredients made from genetically modified corn, soybeans, potatoes or other crops, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, an Ohio Democrat, is sponsoring bills requiring labeling and safety testing of such foods.</p>
        <p>He seized upon the discovery, initially made by a coalition opposed to bioengineered foods, that taco shells sold under the Taco Bell brand contained small amounts of a genetically modified corn known as StarLink. The corn, with a gene to make it more pest-resistant, has been approved for use as animal feed but not for human consumption because it contains a protein with some characteristics of an allergen.</p>
        <p>''It concerns me, and should concern American consumers, that this is a glimpse of things to come as genetically engineered products are rushed to store shelves without real mandatory safety testing and labeling programs in place,'' Mr. Kucinich said in a statement last week.</p>
        <p>He later elaborated in an interview that if labeling were required the problem might have been caught, because labeling ''would establish a higher level of responsibility among those in the biotechnology industry in controlling what is in their products.''</p>
        <p>But those in the food industry say this is not a case of a biotechnology product being rushed to market without safety testing. Indeed, it was because of such tests that the corn in question had not been approved for human consumption. Nor, they say, would labeling have made a difference in this case, since the taco shells were not supposed to have the StarLink corn in the first place.</p>
        <p>Kraft said the corn came from a Texas mill operated by Azteca Milling, which said yesterday that it was investigating what might have happened.</p>
        <p>What the incident does show, in any case, is how difficult it is to keep one crop from contaminating another. The problem has also arisen this year in Europe, where genetically modified material was discovered in supposedly conventional crops. Keeping crops segregated will require duplicate grain elevators, trucks and barges, raising food prices, some analysts say.</p>
        <p>Another issue is the trickiness of testing whether food and crops have been genetically engineered. Both Kraft, a subsidiary of Philip Morris, and the Food and Drug Administration scrambled last week to figure out how to test for the presence of StarLink corn in the taco shells. A cottage industry has sprung up to offer such tests, and the Agriculture Department is setting up a laboratory to develop standardized tests and certify testing laboratories.</p>
        <p>''The grain markets want to have assurances that the tests they are utilizing and the laboratories they are utilizing are credible,'' said Steven N. Tanner, the official in charge of the project. Although Washington believes that genetically modified foods are the same as other foods and need no labeling, American crops will have to be tested for export to countries with labeling laws, he said.</p>
        <p>There is no evidence that the modified foods approved for human consumption are harmful. But critics say safety testing has not been adequate so such foods should be labeled to give consumers the choice of avoiding them.</p>
        <p>''If juice is from concentrate it has to be labeled,'' said Jean Halloran, director of the Consumer Policy Institute of the Consumers Union. ''The difference between juice that is from concentrate and not from concentrate is much less than between genetically engineered and nonengineered foods.''</p>
        <p>Biotechnology and food industry executives say the critics want labeling because it will scare people away. ''It is not designed to inform people; it is designed to alarm people,'' said Gene Grabowski, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America, which represents food companies. ''In Britain, where they have mandatory labeling, you cannot find biotech foods.''</p>
        <p>How costly labeling would be is a matter of some debate and study. And to some extent it depends on the practical issues, starting with what exactly should be labeled.</p>
        <p>Cheese, for instance, used to be made using an enzyme from calves' stomachs that coagulates proteins in milk. But it was sometimes hard to procure enough calf stomachs, so the enzyme is now made by bacteria or yeast using the calf enzyme gene. Neither the bacteria, the yeast nor the enzyme get into the cheese. So should such cheese be considered genetically modified?</p>
        <p>What about pork chops from a pig that ate genetically modified corn?</p>
        <p>The European Union requires labeling mainly for ingredients made from modified corn and soy. But Representative Kucinich's bill would require labeling the pork chops and the cheese and any other product even touched by genetic engineering. That could apply to most foods in the supermarket. Enzymes made in genetically engineered microbes are used as processing aids in making not only cheese but some breads, yogurt and beer.</p>
        <p>Another question is how much contamination to allow. Europe does not require labeling of ingredients that are less than 1 percent genetically modified. Mr. Kucinich's bill, which has more than 50 co-sponsors but is not expected to be acted on this year, would not set any threshold, so even a speck of genetically modified material would qualify for labeling.</p>
        <p>But the American agricultural system moves grain so fast that it tolerates 2 to 7 percent foreign matter in bulk shipments of corn. So trying to provide grain with less than 1 percent genetically modified content could be unrealistic, the Institute of Food Technologists, a scientific society, said in a report last week.</p>
        <p>How low the threshold can be set also depends to some extent on the sensitivity of the tests. Those using the tests now say that while the tests usually work, there can be occasional inconsistencies.</p>
        <p>''We've had samples rejected on the barge with 30 percent G.M.O. and then retested at 0 percent,'' said John Benz of the Ursa Farmer's Co-op in Ursa, Ill., referring to genetically modified organisms. Experts say results can vary based on the seeds chosen for sampling.</p>
        <p>Testing processed food is harder than testing crops. Heating and other steps in food processing can destroy both the protein created by the implanted gene and the implanted DNA itself. Some highly refined foods like corn oil and refined sugar contain virtually no DNA or protein at all. Europe does not require such oils to labeled, even if they are made from genetically modified corn or soy.</p>
        <p>Genetic ID of Fairfield, Iowa, the company that did the initial tests of the taco shells for the coalition of biotechnology critics, found about 1 percent of the StarLink corn, an amount on the borderline of what would require labeling in Europe. The test was for the DNA, so it did not establish that the protein itself,  the potential allergen, was in the taco shells.</p>
        <p>When the coalition announced its findings on Sept. 18, Aventis Crop-Science, which developed StarLink corn, challenged their validity. And on Friday, it said Kraft's test might have confused the unapproved corn with another ingredient.</p>
        <p>One problem is that many tests detect only a single type of modified grain. As the number of different genes put into plants grows, testing for all of them could become burdensome. So a labeling system could not be based solely on testing. Rather, crops would have to be followed from seed through food processing with a paper trail.</p>
        <p>''Unless you know the history of the sample, you don't know what you are testing for,'' said Eluned Jones, associate professor of agriculture and agribusiness at Virginia Tech. ''It has to start at the farm level. You can't just test it at the final level and put a label on.''</p>
        <p>Despite the practical problems, the food and biotechnology industries themselves will have a strong interest in making crop segregation and testing work. Genetic engineering is currently used to make crops resistant to insects or herbicides, traits that have little value to consumers. But biotechnology companies are working on genetically modified crops to produce food oils lower in artery-clogging fats, or tomatoes rich in cancer-fighting substances. The industry will want those crops segregated and foods made from them labeled.</p>
