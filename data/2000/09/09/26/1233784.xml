        <p>When Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner travels to China to play table tennis, he is mobbed when he leaves his hotel, as if he were a rock star walking around Manhattan or a soccer star walking around Europe.</p>
        <p>The Chinese recognize Waldner for his Olympic gold medal in 1992, for his endurance and for his style.</p>
        <p>But in these Summer Games, there is no mercy for the venerable Waldner, who turns 35 on Oct. 3. Ten years his junior, Kong Linghui of China outlasted Waldner for the gold medal tonight, 21-16, 21-19, 17-21, 14-21, 21-13, in a match of mood swings.</p>
        <p>In the bronze medal match, Liu Guoliang of China, the 1996 Olympic champion, defeated Joergen Persson of Sweden, 21-18, 19-21, 21-14, 21-13. Fans of both nations -- including King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden, both wearing yellow shirts -- waved flags and chanted for players who are quite familiar to them.</p>
        <p>''I have respected him since my childhood,'' Kong said. ''He has been playing against China for several generations.''</p>
        <p>This expression of sportsmanship and respect from Kong might be traced to his being a distant descendant of Confucius, although Kong played down the link in an interview in a magazine, saying: ''I'm an ordinary person. I can't boast about things I personally haven't done.''</p>
        <p>He now has a gold medal in the latest match between these two table tennis powers. The bond is personified by the link between Kong and Waldner. Eight years ago, the young Kong was sent to Sweden to play for Kalmar BTK in the Elite League, Sweden's top professional table tennis league. The Chinese made a bit of money from the move, perhaps, but it also gave Kong experience in different styles.</p>
        <p>Waldner, who has traveled extensively in China, now plays for Kalmar, but they have never played for that team at the same time. And Swedish players go to China because it is the center of the universe in table tennis.</p>
        <p>''You can have a conversation with a normal person on the street and they know all about him,'' Ulf Carlsson, the Swedish coach, said of Waldner.</p>
        <p>The Chinese have dominated the sport since it joined the Olympic movement in 1988. China has won 14 gold, 9 silver and 3 bronze medals, including all four golds this year. Sweden has one bronze in addition to Waldner's gold and silver.</p>
        <p>The Chinese domination is hardly an accident, as Kong explained later.</p>
        <p>''A major reason is the training,'' Kong said. ''We are able to get excellent athletes to play this sport, so we can win with different players. We are able to see videos to evaluate the techniques. It is very difficult to win, as you have seen today, and in the final points, it depends on luck.''</p>
        <p>Waldner was not ready to attribute China's success to luck. ''It is normal that they win both the singles and doubles,'' he said later. ''But sometimes we win.''</p>
        <p>Waldner is seen as one player who can stand up to the Chinese. He is known as a sociable visitor, who likes to get out perhaps as much as he likes to practice. He also has an eccentric serve in which he contorts his right arm inward, so that his serve seemingly emerges from under his left armpit.</p>
        <p>Tonight, facing game point in the second game, Waldner maneuvered his opponent to his left, leaving plenty of table for a smash, but he played it too fine and missed the table entirely. He then lost the first 4 points of the third game, but stormed back to win two straight games.</p>
        <p>In the fifth game, Kong tried to play to Waldner's forehead and ran off an early lead of 10-1. Waldner maintained that he did not lose his composure, saying, ''If you cannot concentrate in the fifth game of the Olympics, you shouldn't even play.''</p>
        <p>He came back and trailed by only 15-12 before losing. Then the Chinese celebrated their latest gold medal, while the Swedish king and queen left, mingling with other spectators.</p>
        <p>Chinese dominance is not likely to be affected by the rule change coming on Oct. 1, enlarging the official ball from 38 millimeters (1.496 inches) in width to 40 (1.5748 inches). The ball is being changed to produce longer rallies, but whether that will help an older player like Waldner remains to be seen.</p>
        <p>''He has been very important in this sport, and I admire him very much, but whether he can continue to play, I don't know,'' the descendant of Confucius said.</p>
