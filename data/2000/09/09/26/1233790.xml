        <p>Of the many modes in which the enterprising New York City Opera functions these days, an opera from the heart of the repertory in a fully conventional production may soon be the rarest. But there was Verdi's ''Traviata'' on Friday evening, returning to the New York State Theater in Renata Scotto's 1995 staging.</p>
        <p>The production, last seen in 1997, is mostly attractive and eminently serviceable. It manages to achieve a certain Zeffirellian grandeur and sumptuousness on a small scale, if that is not a contradiction in terms.</p>

        <p>Of the many modes in which the enterprising New York City Opera functions these days, an opera from the heart of the repertory in a fully conventional production may soon be the rarest. But there was Verdi's ''Traviata'' on Friday evening, returning to the New York State Theater in Renata Scotto's 1995 staging.</p>
        <p>The production, last seen in 1997, is mostly attractive and eminently serviceable. It manages to achieve a certain Zeffirellian grandeur and sumptuousness on a small scale, if that is not a contradiction in terms.</p>
        <p>At any rate there is enough hubbub and distraction in the party scenes that a strong stage presence is needed to command the viewer's attention. And this production surely has one in Mary Dunleavy, who sings the title role of the consumptive courtesan Violetta, thrown off her sybaritic bearings by a real romantic attachment to a smitten Alfredo.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dunleavy's bright tone and admirable vocal agility are just the beginning, for she gives a strong and compelling dramatic portrayal, taking frequent chances along the way. Indeed the vocal performance itself is quickly made subservient to the drama, with fluid rhythm and speechlike inflection, and with fioritura deftly turned to laughter.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dunleavy built to an intensity that occasionally threatened to spin out of control into a scenery-chewing mad scene, as at the end of the first act. But for the most part, she seemed to know when too much was enough and avoided the outer limits. Cumulatively, she gave the sense of a flame burning within, which made the protracted carryings-on of a dying consumptive on Alfredo's return seem plausible, fueled by sheer force of will and abundance of spirit.</p>
        <p>The other strong outing came from Stephen Powell as Giorgio Germont, persuading Violetta to abandon Alfredo, his son, for the good of the family. Mr. Powell began a bit stiffly and blandly yet built to great power by the end of the scene, making the capitulation of even so formidable a Violetta understandable.</p>
        <p>But what these performances amounted to for the Alfredo, Bruce Fowler, were further obstacles in staking his own claim on a busy stage. Mr. Fowler sang accurately and sometimes attractively, but his tone often seemed small and colorless alongside those of his partners. Still more, his dramatic presence: tentative and wooden, little aided, it seemed, by Beth Greenberg's stage direction. With a stronger foil, Ms. Dunleavy's Violetta might well have seemed less extreme.</p>
        <p>Kate Aldrich was appealing as Flora, and the rest of the cast proved adequate and often better.</p>
        <p>At times Joseph Rescigno's conducting seemed considerate, allowing the singers to expand the tops of their phrases; at other times, simply loose, especially in crowd scenes. The orchestra sounded less distinguished than it had a week before in ''Madama Butterfly.''</p>
        <p>As always at the start of a run, it is possible to hope that such things will iron themselves out and that Mr. Fowler will gain stature in later performances, beginning tonight.</p>
