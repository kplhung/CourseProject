        <p>Once in a great while, a natural history book changes the way people look at the world.</p>
        <p>In 1838, John James Audubon's ''Birds of America'' was one, the first illustrated book of North American birds. In 1934, Roger Tory Peterson produced ''Field Guide to the Birds,'' the first to use paintings and drawings to depict living birds as they appear in the field, with arrows pointing out specific markings.</p>
        <p>Peterson's guide stood the publishing world on its head with its instant and widespread popularity. The Peterson system, as it has become known, spawned a series of highly useful guides that is still going strong.</p>
        <p>Now comes ''The Sibley Guide to Birds,'' an encyclopedic illustrated guide to the birds of North America. The book will be published next month, but birders and ornithologists who have seen it are already hailing it and its author, David Allen Sibley.</p>
        <p>Many people, this writer included, did not see the need for another guide to North American birds. It shows how wrong one can be.</p>
        <p>''David has just raised the bar,'' said Pete Dunne, author of numerous books and director of the New Jersey Audubon Society's Cape May Bird Observatory. ''This book represents the high-water mark for bird guides.''</p>
        <p>Simon Perkins, field ornithologist for the Massachusetts Audubon Society, calls the book ''a quantum leap.''</p>
        <p>Each species is depicted in a clear and easy to understand way with multiple illustrations starting with the flying bird from above and below, a first for any bird guide and a feature that will be extremely useful to intermediate and advanced birders who often deal with birds overhead at migratory hot spots along either coast or inland.</p>
        <p>And each species is shown in juvenile, immature, male and female plumages, both ordinary and breeding, more than other guides attempt.</p>
        <p>Of course, no subject is ever going to look exactly like the illustration. A drawing is a composite of the artist's experience and a photograph is a record of a fleeting instant, a snapshot in time. Generally, though, paintings and drawings of birds can do much more than photographs to emphasize field marks. And when the artist is a master birder, with an eye for detail and tremendous field experience, the results have a much greater chance of depicting what it is one may actually see when confronted with a certain species in the field.</p>
        <p>Birds, specifically sketching, drawing and painting them, have been the central theme for Mr. Sibley's life from as far back as he remembers. He began observing birds when he was 7, and by 12 he was photographing birds in the hand, sketching birds and had already amassed an impressive volume of data.</p>
        <p>More than 20 years ago, he began thinking about producing a field guide. ''I wanted all plumages, age classes and sexes, of all species,'' he said. ''I wanted to know and categorize everything about birds.''</p>
        <p>''David is one of the supreme field birders in the United States,'' said Dr. Noble S. Proctor, a professor of ornithology at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven and an author of an ornithological textbook.</p>
        <p>That skill as a field observer, married with his gifts as an artist, has given the guide a distinctive, personal feel. Whereas most field guides are collaborative efforts, this one is the way Mr. Sibley wanted it, envisioned it and shaped it in more than a decade of work. It is the guide he always wished he could use.</p>
        <p>Each species has its common and scientific names as well as its average measurements, including length, wingspan (also a first for a North American guide) and weight in both imperial and metric systems.</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Sibley points out in his introduction and elsewhere in the book, birds are highly variable. ''Do not expect any bird to look exactly like the illustrations,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For example, bird weights are highly variable, a function of the fantastic migrations that many undertake. Some long-distance migrants having the ability to almost double their body weight in some instances, storing subcutaneous fat to be used in long nonstop flights. A warbler that has just arrived after a night of flying may weigh far less than an individual that has been feeding for a few days or longer. Side by side the differences are apparent.</p>
        <p>Asked how he painted his amazing flight shots, Mr. Sibley smiled. ''It is a question that requires a long answer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sibley's father, Fred Sibley, is an accomplished and well traveled ornithologist who studied California condors in the late 1960's, later directed the Point Reyes Bird Observatory in California and then became vertebrate curator at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale, where he recently retired.</p>
        <p>David's older brother, Steve, started listing birds he had observed, and by the age of 7, David was taking birds out of mist nets, fine nets ornithologists use to capture birds without injuring them, and competing against his older sibling. Sibling rivalry and an insatiable desire for information spurred him on. He became proficient at handling live birds by the next year, and he soon  began collecting and organizing information, facts and figures.</p>
        <p>At 12, he was taking photographs of birds in the hand with wings outstretched. He took pictures of the open-winged birds from above and below, of juveniles, immatures, females and males. He amassed a file of pictures accompanied by sketches made of birds in flight that featured pictures of birds displaying features and marks that only a few accomplished birders knew about.</p>
        <p>When the idea came to him about how to organize the species, depicting each bird with separate paintings for each plumage, accompanied with notes on behavior or unique field marks, descriptions of voice, range maps and similar confusing species all on the same page, so did the idea of the paintings of the flying birds at the top of each page.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sibley, who is 38, and his wife, Joan Walsh, credit Mr. Dunne of the Cape May center and Will Russell, who operates a natural history tour company called Wings, with enabling him to complete the project. Mr. Dunne hired Mr. Sibley as a hawk counter in Cape May, giving him a base from which to operate. And Mr. Russell hired him to conduct birding tours.</p>
        <p>Expert birders who have seen the book call it a must-have guide for anyone interested in birds.</p>
        <p>Of course, there are a few complaints. Some expert birders say the book contains, if anything, too much information. And at 9.5 inches long and 2.65 pounds, it is more than some people will want to carry into the field.</p>
        <p>For these and other reasons, Houghton-Mifflin, publishers of the Peterson guides, need not worry that sales of its volumes will go into eclipse. In fact, the company itself is coming out with a new competitor to the Peterson books, ''Birds of North America,'' part of a new series, the Kaufman Focus Guides, by Kenn Kaufman. It is notable in that it uses computer-modified photographs to illustrate each species.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sibley's guide ''is far and away the best single book on North American birds,'' said Denny Abbott, of Stratham, N.H., a founding member of the American Birding Association.</p>
        <p>Wayne Petersen, a field ornithologist at Massachusetts Audubon and vice president of the American Birding Association, said the book ''once again raised the standard of excellence in a North American field guide.''</p>
        <p>''The Sibley Guide's open format, telegraphic field descriptions, consistency in artistic style and breadth of plumage coverage combine to give North American birders a guide reminiscent of those produced in the finest European tradition,'' Mr. Petersen said. ''It's a gem!"</p>
