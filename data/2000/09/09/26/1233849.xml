        <p>As a show of market power, the joint intervention to rescue the euro seems not to have much impressed its audience.</p>
        <p>Today, on the first full business day after major central banks intervened in the currency markets to revive the downtrodden European common currency, and threatened to do so again, the markets barely reacted.</p>
        <p>The euro, the currency adopted by 11 European nations nearly two years ago, traded throughout the day around 88 cents to the dollar, and weakened to 87.30 cents in late New York trading, compared with 87.87 late Friday. At its high point after the intervention, the euro sold for about 90 cents. Today's rate is only around 3 cents above its low and well below what some European officials consider its true value.</p>
        <p>Indeed, as finance ministers and central bankers from around the world attended annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank here today, there were new signs that the American leaders are less worried than Europeans about reversing the euro's decline.</p>
        <p>The unexpected decision by the United States to join the rescue attempt on Friday surprised investors and lent further credibility to the European Central Bank's move. Japan and Canada intervened, too.</p>
        <p>But the tone of American statements was more ambivalent than that of European bankers. Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers insisted over the weekend that the United States had not changed its view that ''a strong dollar'' was in the interests of the United States.</p>
        <p>Ernst Welteke, president of Germany's central bank, let it be known today that he and other German officials were frustrated by Mr. Summers's remarks, as they seemed to undermine the use of future interventions.</p>
        <p>''They thought the remarks of Larry Summers had not been very helpful,'' said Rolf-Ernst Breuer, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, who met with Mr. Welteke and other senior German officials here this morning.</p>
        <p>European leaders made clear that they wanted to do more than simply stop the decline of the euro, which has lost about 25 percent of its value against the dollar since its introduction in January 1999.</p>
        <p>Over the weekend, Finance Minister Laurent Fabius of France emphasized the need to achieve a higher rate.</p>
        <p>Wim Duisenberg, the European Central Bank president, talked about achieving an ''orderly reversal'' in the euro's decline.</p>
        <p>Because a failed intervention would do greater damage to the euro's credibility than no intervention at all, it is hard to imagine that the European Central Bank will not act again.</p>
        <p>European officials meeting here in Prague said repeatedly in the last couple of days that they would intervene again if appropriate and made clear that the euro's current value is nowhere near the level they want.</p>
        <p>But there was no hint of a follow-up campaign today, nor was there any anxious repositioning of portfolios by currency traders in anticipation of one.</p>
        <p>Adding to the pressure, European officials are preparing for the possibility of more bad publicity on Thursday, when Denmark votes on whether to adopt the euro. Polls have shown the Danes almost evenly divided, but the euro's decline in the last few weeks appears to have strengthened the opponents.</p>
        <p>While a Danish rejection of the euro might have little immediate impact on its trading value, it could increase resistance in the two bigger countries that have stayed out of the monetary union, Britain and Sweden.</p>
        <p>''Of course it would be bad news for the euro,'' said Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at Dresdner Bank. ''Right now, all news about the euro is bad news.''</p>
        <p>The more fundamental problem, analysts say, is that the euro's weakness does not lend itself to a quick fix through central bank intervention.</p>
        <p>Intervening on behalf of a currency generally works best if a large number of speculators have already been betting heavily in one direction, because central banks can often squeeze out traders with a short but intense bout of buying in the other direction.</p>
        <p>But the euro's core troubles are reflected in long-term investment flows, and may stem from the effects of corporate mergers and acquisitions as well as portfolio investments. In general, those investments have been pouring out of Europe and into the United States, reflecting higher American growth.</p>
        <p>''It is the long-term flows that are leaving the country,'' said Tony Norfield, chief currency analyst at ABN Amro, ''not the mad speculators. There are very few positions out there to squeeze.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, analysts say that money managers, particularly in Asia, bet too heavily in favor of the euro. Many did so initially because they liked the idea of having an alternative to the dollar, but then funds invested heavily on the mistaken conviction that the euro was overdue for a rebound after its early declines.</p>
        <p>Those expectations were kindled by almost all major bank and investment banks, which were overly optimistic about the euro's prospects.</p>
        <p>Axel Siedenberg, head of economic research at Deutsche Bank, said the goal of intervention is not so much to strengthen the euro as to keep it from sinking further. And that, he said, is an attainable goal.</p>
        <p>''The intervention was not intended to start a new trend toward a strong euro,'' Mr. Siedenberg said. ''The message to the market is that this is the bottom.''</p>
