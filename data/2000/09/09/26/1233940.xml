        <p>MANHATTAN: AIDS PROTESTERS ARRESTED  Eleven people demonstrating against what they called inadequate housing and other city services for people with AIDS chained themselves around a pillar yesterday inside the Human Resources Administration building in Lower Manhattan.

        <p>MANHATTAN: CLINIC OPENS IN SCHOOL  The Jacob H. Schiff Elementary School opened a free primary-care clinic yesterday for students and their parents. The clinic, unlike rudimentary health services at many public schools, has a full-time doctor and a nurse practitioner and provides comprehensive physical examinations and vaccinations. Some 1,600 students, more than half of whom have no medical insurance, and their parents are expected to benefit from the program, which is federally financed for three years.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: RAPPER ARRESTED  The rapper Queen Pen was arrested early yesterday on charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest after a shooting at a Manhattan nightclub. The police arrested Ms. Pen, 28, whose real name is Lynise Walters, after a report of a disturbance at Club Pulse, at East 54th Street and Second Avenue. As they approached the club, the police said, they heard three shots. No one was injured by the gunfire and no weapon was recovered, but Ms. Pen, of West Babylon, N.Y., was arrested after the police found her in a heated argument with another woman. Detective Robert Samuel, a police spokesman, said she was not suspected of involvement in the shooting.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: JUDGE ALLOWS SPRAYING  The city can continue to spray neighborhoods with pesticides in its battle against the spread of the West Nile virus, a federal judge ruled yesterday as he struck down arguments by environmentalists. The judge, John S. Martin, said in a written opinion that the No Spray Coalition, the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides and other groups had not proved that the city was violating federal law. The groups had argued that large-scale spraying by the city over the last two summers threatened the health of the public as much as or more than the virus, which killed 7 people in the New York region last year and sickened at least 13 this year.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: ASSAULTS AT NIGHTCLUB  Two Brooklyn men were attacked in the Tunnel nightclub on 12th Avenue in separate incidents early yesterday, the police said. At 1 a.m., Kevin Truluck, 22,  was stabbed in the chest as he stood at the bar. He told the police that he did not see the assailant, but that he had been involved in a fight earlier. At 3 a.m., a man in the club grabbed a gold chain worn by Kevin Parris, 23, and slashed him in the face with a sharp object, the authorities said. Both men were treated at St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center and released.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: FEDERAL OFFICERS SUE  The union representing federal police officers in Manhattan filed suit in federal court yesterday to stop the government from eliminating 30 of 65 federal officers who patrol federal property in Manhattan. Stephen DeNigris, the lawyer for the union, the Fraternal Order of Police, said the General Services Administration, which has jurisdiction over the officers, was endangering security at federal sites. Thomas J. Ryan, G.S.A. regional administrator, said he had not seen the lawsuit. But he said that the 30 officers whose jobs are to be eliminated on Saturday were temporary workers hired after the 1994 bombing of the World Trade Center and that their contracts had been extended three times.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: MOST POPULAR BABY NAMES  As in previous years, Michael and Ashley continue to be the most popular names for babies born in New York City, according to the latest list compiled by the city's Department of Health. But don't count out Latrell (39) or Keyshawn (43) or an expanding number of Elvises (56 last year, up from 32 in 1998). Of the nearly 124,000 babies born last year, there were 711 Ashleys and 1,139 Michaels.</p>

        <p>MINEOLA: OFFICERS INDICTED  A correction officer was indicted yesterday on charges that he assaulted an inmate at the Nassau County Jail and then filed a false report to try to cover it up. Michael Selover, a Sheriff's Department corporal who supervised the officer, was also indicted on a charge of offering a false instrument for filing. District Attorney Denis Dillon said that the officer, Alberto Roman, and other guards assaulted an inmate, Robert Semprini, on Feb. 23, 1998, after an argument between the two became physical. Officer Roman and Corporal Selover submitted reports claiming the inmate struck the first blow and that Officer Roman had delivered a single blow in return, Mr. Dillon said.</p>

        <p>BRONX: PEDESTRIAN KILLED  A 27-year-old man was killed last night by a driver who the police said was drunk. The victim, Eduardo Perez, was walking in the intersection of East 177th Street and the Sheridan Expressway in the West Farms section at 6:30 p.m. when he was struck by a van driven by John Gathers, 44, who was coming down an exit ramp of the Bronx River Parkway, said Detective Edward Reuss, a police spokesman. Mr. Perez, of 2030 Cross-Bronx Expressway, died several hours later at Jacobi Medical Center, Detective Reuss said. Mr. Gathers, of the Belmont section, was charged with driving while intoxicated and vehicular manslaughter.</p>

        <p>BAYONNE: TEENAGER'S DEATH STILL A MYSTERY  The authorities are trying to determine why a 13-year-old girl collapsed and died at the end of soccer practice Friday afternoon. The girl, Marisa Minisci, was jogging with her team at Holy Family Academy in Bayonne, where she was a freshman, when she collapsed, said her mother, Helene Minisci. Mrs. Minisci said that her daughter had not had any condition that might have contributed to her collapse. Edward DeFazio, an assistant Hudson County prosecutor, said that an autopsy had ruled out foul play, but that further tests were needed.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: CANDIDATES OBJECT TO DEBATES  Independent candidates for the United State Senate from the Green and Reform Parties say they are being unfairly excluded from debates by the League of Women Voters of New Jersey. Bruce Afran, a civil rights lawyer running on the Green Party line; Pat Dinizio, the Reform Party candidate and a member of the rock group the Smithereens; and Dennis Breen, the Independent Party candidate, said the league used unfair criteria, like extensive fund-raising. Patricia Tieman, executive director of the league, did not provide a list of criteria but said the candidates did not meet the qualifications.  Steve Strunsky (NYT)</p>
