        <p>The Giants still held a slim hope of salvaging the game when the Redskins lined up to punt with two minutes remaining on Sunday night. On fourth-and-4 from the Giants' 34-yard line, the Giants' rookie Brandon Short jumped offside. The 5-yard penalty gave the Redskins a first down and essentially ended the game. The Giants did not get the ball back and lost, 16-6.</p>
        <p>Today, Short said that he had been tricked on the play; the Washington center quickly moved his hand from the ball to his hip, feigning a snap. Short was looking upfield and caught the movement out of the corner of his eye and jumped offside. He was sure the Redskins were trying to lure the Giants into a penalty and he blamed himself for falling into the trap.</p>

        <p>The Giants still held a slim hope of salvaging the game when the Redskins lined up to punt with two minutes remaining on Sunday night. On fourth-and-4 from the Giants' 34-yard line, the Giants' rookie Brandon Short jumped offside. The 5-yard penalty gave the Redskins a first down and essentially ended the game. The Giants did not get the ball back and lost, 16-6.</p>
        <p>Today, Short said that he had been tricked on the play; the Washington center quickly moved his hand from the ball to his hip, feigning a snap. Short was looking upfield and caught the movement out of the corner of his eye and jumped offside. He was sure the Redskins were trying to lure the Giants into a penalty and he blamed himself for falling into the trap.</p>
        <p>''He got me,'' Short said today. ''It was very frustrating. At the time, nobody else saw him do that. I wasn't even sure if that happened.''</p>
        <p>Short also admitted he had been overanxious on the play, because he badly wanted to block the punt and said that might have led to his penalty. He was relieved today when videotape of the game confirmed his suspicion that he had been tricked.</p>
        <p>''Even though the game is over and we lost, personally I feel better about the whole situation right now, because I know it was trickery,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Offensive Line Struggles</p>
        <p>For three games, the Giants' rebuilt offensive line had been one of their more surprising units. With three new players and only one player back at his position from last season, the line had jelled to provide solid protection for quarterback Kerry Collins, open the running game and eliminate the mistakes that plagued last year's unit.</p>
        <p>That confidence evaporated quickly Sunday night, as Collins was continually pressured. After being sacked three times in the Giants' first three games, Collins endured four sacks Sunday.</p>
        <p>''We played horribly,'' guard Glenn Parker said. ''It's never an end-of-the-world situation. We'll address it and get better, but we were terrible. If we play with confidence and play mistake-free football, we can be as good as anybody, but we have to play mistake-free to be that good.''</p>
        <p>Beyond the sacks and two penalties were other mental errors and missed calls. Coach Jim Fassel cited a miscommunication on the line that left defensive end Bruce Smith open for a sack in the first quarter. On second-and-10 at the Redskins' 26, the Redskins brought a linebacker to the line and tackle Lomas Brown blocked him, leaving Smith an open route to Collins. The Giants lost 8 yards on the play, 2 more on third down and were forced to punt on fourth-and-20 from the 36.</p>
        <p>Barber Runs Past Montgomery</p>
        <p>Tiki Barber's 65 yards rushing gave him 391 after four games, surpassing Joe Montgomery's team-leading 348-yard total in all of 1999.</p>
