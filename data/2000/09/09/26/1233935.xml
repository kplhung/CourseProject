      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Robert S. Wilson, a firefighter here, got right to the point when asked what he liked about living in Suffolk County: ''Our budget isn't going down the tubes.''</p>
        <p>Anything else?</p>
        <p>''It's not Nassau.''</p>
        <p>From his safe remove a few hundred yards east of the county line, Mr. Wilson can watch with amusement as Nassau County struggles to crawl out of the mire of a $143 million deficit, fights to avoid a state takeover of its finances, and tries to improve its bond rating (currently, one step above junk).</p>
        <p>''I think it's hilarious,'' he said of Nassau's predicament while chatting in the firehouse office with two co-workers, Karen Herbert and Joyce Logan.</p>
        <p>Ms. Logan showed more sympathy for her neighbors. ''I think it's very sad,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wilson remained wickedly gleeful.</p>
        <p>''They had the last Republican machine in the country, and they even screwed that up in the last election,'' he said. ''It would make it quicker to get into the city if you blew up Nassau County. By about 15 miles.''</p>
        <p>In years past, many Long Islanders preferred living in Nassau, the county closer to New York City and known for its good schools and better shopping. But now, Suffolk residents, fresh from the indignity and inconvenience of a change in their area code, are snickering a bit at their western neighbors, saddled with rising taxes and a discombobulated government.</p>
        <p>In dozens of interviews in September along both sides of the county line, from Massapequa north to Huntington, Long Islanders shook their heads in dismay over Nassau's fallen state, though they generally remained loyal to the county they lived in.</p>
        <p>''It used to be thought that the people who lived out in Suffolk were country folk, sort of hillbillies almost, people who were really opting for the simple life,'' said Richard Himelfarb, an associate professor of political science at Hofstra University who is glad that he moved in 1998 from Hempstead, in Nassau County, to West Islip, in Suffolk.</p>
        <p>But these days, the country mice seem to be finding themselves with a little bit more cheese than the closer-to-the-city mice. ''As Nassau County has become more and more congested,'' Professor Himelfarb said, ''and housing prices and the cost of living have risen, people I think are starting to say: 'You know, living out there with the country folk is not so bad. You can drive to the drugstore a mile away and be back in five minutes, and it's nice to have the ocean two miles from where you live, where you're not going to get caught in a snarl of parking.'</p>
        <p>''What do you associate with Nassau County?'' he asked. ''The traffic and congestion is horrific in Nassau County, and it only gets better when you get to Suffolk County.''</p>
        <p>Professor Himelfarb, a new father, said he preferred the less expensive housing and the less crowded roads of Suffolk. ''If you're thinking about buying, with cost and property taxes, you get a much better deal in Suffolk County,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, Professor Himelfarb said, Nassau County is perceived as being poorly administered and inherently corrupt, and is being forced to raise taxes considerably to maintain that system.</p>
        <p>His colleagues tell him they have found the same problems in Nassau, he said.</p>
        <p>''Nobody says, 'Oh, gee, you've just got to live in East Meadow or Garden City,' '' he said. ''It's too expensive.''</p>
        <p>He'd get no argument from one Nassau resident, a retired high school athletic coach from New Hyde Park who was waiting for his wife on a bench at Sunrise Mall in Massapequa, on Nassau's South Shore, one recent afternoon.</p>
        <p>The man, who would not give his name, said he and his wife were barely making ends meet on a retirement income of $60,000 to $70,000.</p>
        <p>''What does the average person do in Nassau County? The only thing that saves you is your house,'' he said, noting that his, which he bought for $36,000, is now worth about $336,000, an increase in value that will be useful now that he is thinking of buying a home in Huntington, just east of the county line. But Nassau's problems are causing housing values to fall, he said, adding, ''The most political place in the world is Nassau County.''</p>
        <p>At the mall, Josephine Bellitto, a retired nurse from Massapequa whose daughter lives in Suffolk, said she was partial to Nassau. ''I used to think I was better off, before we went into the red,'' she said, referring to her county's financial problems and planned cuts in government services. ''So far nothing has affected me very much, but you hear them talk about raising taxes.''</p>
        <p>Mary Vavassis, who was standing nearby, said Nassau's taxes were already too high. ''I do try to shop in Suffolk,'' said Ms. Vavassis, who lives in the Nassau County hamlet of Baldwin. ''You save in taxes, but then you pay in gasoline.''</p>
        <p>Christine Tarantino, a medical technologist from Nassau County, also shops in Suffolk County to avoid paying Nassau's 4.25 percent sales tax on clothing. (Suffolk, like New York City and New York State, does not charge sales tax on clothing and shoes costing $110 or less.) As she waited for relatives at the Walt Whitman Mall in the town of Huntington, she said her property taxes would be raised again because of the ''whopping'' county deficit.</p>
        <p>''I don't think enough people really watched what was going on,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She can see some advantages of moving away from such troubles.</p>
        <p>''You can go farther out east for much bigger houses and less money, and the school districts are picking up,'' Ms. Tarantino said of Suffolk County. ''Parts of it are really becoming more desirable.''</p>
        <p>Richard Sutton, who owns the Kiva Trading Company, a jewelry store in Cold Spring Harbor, lives in Huntington but is worried about Nassau's problems, because his wife works at Nassau Community College. He cited layoffs, tax increases and service cutbacks in the county next door.</p>
        <p>''They all concern me,'' he said. ''You can't do one and not have an effect on a great number of people. These are my customers. I don't like any of it, but obviously it's a crisis situation.''</p>
        <p>He said Nassau County, where he lived briefly, had a lot to offer its residents. ''You still have a little bit of that city feeling,'' he said. But Nassau's problems could make its residents consider moving. ''In my view, for people who are tending toward moving east, this might put them over the edge.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Suffolk is growing faster than Nassau. The Suffolk population increased 4.6 percent from 1990 to 1999, while Nassau's rose 1.4 percent during the same period.</p>
        <p>Dan Finn, an accountant who lives one block into Suffolk County, on County Line Road in the town of Babylon, likes the lower property taxes and town beaches of Suffolk.</p>
        <p>''I really am kind of a pro-Suffolk person, especially after what Gulotta did to Nassau,'' he said, referring to the county executive, Thomas A. Gulotta. ''That's such a misappropriation of funds, it's ridiculous. If that ever happened to Suffolk, I would probably leave Long Island.''</p>
        <p>He moved to Babylon from Bellmore, in Nassau, but is glad to be close to his old haunts. ''Way out in Suffolk, I couldn't live there,'' he said. ''Out there, you're not really part of anything. This is the best of both worlds.''</p>
        <p>Helen Modest is an X-ray technician who lives west of County Line Road, on the Nassau side. As far as property taxes go, she said, Suffolk would be a better place to live, but she will stick to Nassau for now. She knows that for a while, at least, it was thought to be the better choice.</p>
        <p>''People have this misconception that if there are high property taxes, it's a better area, but that's not true,'' she said. ''My taxes were assessed in Nassau County in the 1930's or 1940's. Plus, in Suffolk, there's a lot more land, so the taxes even out.'' Sometimes, she said, friends from Babylon make fun of her for living in a county she calls ''a mess.''</p>
        <p>Rena Sylvester, who helps run the Unique Caribbean American Restaurant on Route 110 in Amityville, said Massapequa has been a good place to raise her two children, although the county's budget problems have affected the services she used to enjoy.</p>
        <p>''Before, they used to really be cleaning the street, and now they're lax,'' she said. ''They don't do as much as they should.''</p>
        <p>In the village of Huntington, some shoppers found the problems over in the 516 area code slightly entertaining, and they wondered why Nassau residents were not more upset.</p>
        <p>''I think it's disgraceful,'' said Joyce Donofrio, referring to the crisis in Nassau. ''I can't believe they let Gulotta get away with all that. I'd be fighting to my death.''</p>
        <p>Her friend and shopping companion, Marge Acerra, agreed. ''Politicians are so awful,'' Ms. Acerra said.  Both women are retired and live in Dix Hills, Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>''Nassau loves Nassau,'' Ms. Donofrio said. ''I don't think they'll come out and bother our place. Nassau is happy in Nassau. I'm shocked that they're not going crazy.''</p>
