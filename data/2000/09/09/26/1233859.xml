        <p>A jury in federal court in Manhattan yesterday ordered Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb wartime leader, to pay $4.5 billion in damages to victims of rape, torture and genocide.</p>
        <p>The award was the largest to come from a series of similar lawsuits against foreign leaders that have been filed in United States courts in the last 20 years. Several have resulted in orders to pay damages, but the judgments have been symbolic, because victims have been unable to collect in nearly all cases.</p>
        <p>Both the jury foreman and the judge in the case took the unusual step yesterday of making statements after the verdict. Bill Walters, the foreman, conceded that it was unlikely that Dr. Karadzic, who remains at large in Bosnia, would be forced to pay.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Walters, a retired stage hand, said he and other members of the jury felt that they had a duty to express their outrage over the conduct of Bosnian Serb soldiers under the political leadership of Dr. Karadzic, who did not appear in court. ''I hope the world gets the message,'' he said. ''What happened was reprehensible.''</p>
        <p>The United States district judge, Peter K. Leisure, praised the jury for its work. ''It's very important that the United States of America rises to the occasion when these things happen, and we not just wait for the United Nations war crimes tribunal,'' the judge said.</p>
        <p>The verdict came just weeks after another jury in New York returned a $745 million verdict against Dr. Karadzic in a civil case focusing on women who were raped during the war in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>After contesting the jurisdiction of an American court, Dr. Karadzic declined to defend himself. In a 1997 letter to Judge Leisure, he questioned the court's right to sit in judgment of him.</p>
        <p>''Can you really hope to find truth, or do justice, or protect rights of people in distant nations?'' Dr. Karadzic asked. ''Do you really believe that attaching a U.S. dollar sign to human tragedy around the world by empty judgments in uncontested lawsuits is a step toward peace or justice?''</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, initially filed in 1993, is one of a series brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights based on an 18th-century law. The law allowed people, American or foreign, to file suit for violations of international law in American courts.</p>
        <p>Mirza Hirkic, one of about 20 plaintiffs in the suit, said yesterday that the verdict was not about monetary damages, but about gaining recognition of the acts committed by Bosnian Serb ultra-nationalists. A widow who moved to Grand Rapids, Mich., in 1993 with her two teenage children, Ms. Hirkic described in her testimony how she last saw her husband when he and other Bosnian Muslim prisoners were led away by Bosnian Serb soldiers.</p>
