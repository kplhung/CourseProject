        <p>To upset Cuba's famed two-time Olympic boxing champion Felix Savon, the United States heavyweight Michael Bennett knew he had to avoid Savon's mighty right hand at any cost. That was the American plan, but Bennett, giving away 6 1/2 inches in height to Savon, couldn't stay out of Savon's range.</p>
        <p>With methodical and brutal efficiency, Savon used his punishing right hand today to chop away at Bennett turning the Olympic boxing tournament's most featured bout into a rout. Savon easily won in the first meeting between the fighters, advancing to the heavyweight division semifinals with a 23-8 decision on points. The fight was stopped at the end of three rounds because Olympic rules require the referee to stop any bout when an opponent trails by 15 points.</p>

        <p>To upset Cuba's famed two-time Olympic boxing champion Felix Savon, the United States heavyweight Michael Bennett knew he had to avoid Savon's mighty right hand at any cost. That was the American plan, but Bennett, giving away 6 1/2 inches in height to Savon, couldn't stay out of Savon's range.</p>
        <p>With methodical and brutal efficiency, Savon used his punishing right hand today to chop away at Bennett turning the Olympic boxing tournament's most featured bout into a rout. Savon easily won in the first meeting between the fighters, advancing to the heavyweight division semifinals with a 23-8 decision on points. The fight was stopped at the end of three rounds because Olympic rules require the referee to stop any bout when an opponent trails by 15 points.</p>
        <p>Bennett, 29, had hoped to become the first Olympic boxer to defeat Savon, who now becomes the runaway favorite to equal countryman Teofilo Stevensen as the first boxer to win three Olympic gold medals in the same weight class.</p>
        <p>Tom Mustin, the coach of the United States team, believed Bennett could get inside enough to perhaps score counter punches to build a lead. And while Bennett landed the first punch of the fight, Savon soon had a 4-1 lead throwing right-hand leads and combinations to Bennett's head. Savon's lead at the end of the first round was 7-2.</p>
        <p>Savon began loading up on his right hand and he found it easy to hit Bennett, who was soon trailing 10-3. After a Savon uppercut snapped Bennett's head back early in the second round, Savon taunted Bennett, dancing in front of him. Bennett charged at the Cuban, but continued to be hit more often than he could hit Savon.</p>
        <p>By the beginning of the third round, Savon led on points 17-6. Midway through the third, Bennett caught Savon with a crisp right hand to the head, but Savon held on and continued to pad his lead. The fight ended as the third round did because Savon was ahead by 23-8.</p>
