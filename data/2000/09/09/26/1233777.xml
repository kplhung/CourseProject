        <p>Three years ago, Stacy Dragila bought a chocolate Labrador retriever and nicknamed it Sydney in the hope that her sport, women's pole vault, would be added to the program for the 2000 Summer Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>Her hope was realized, and tonight Dragila became the first gold medalist in her event. Dragila nearly exited the competition early, but regained her composure to clear 15 feet 1 inch in front of 112,524 people at Olympic stadium, nearly all of them cheering for her main rival.</p>
        <p>''I knew I had to stay within myself and keep my head on my shoulders to perform and hopefully jump higher,'' Dragila said.</p>
        <p>After missing her first two attempts at 14-9, Dragila cleared the bar on her third try. She tends to get stronger the more jumps she takes, and tonight she outlasted Tatyana Grigoryeva, the Australian  who moved here from Russia in 1997. She won the silver medal with a vault of 14-11.</p>
        <p>The bronze medal went to Vala Flosadottir of Iceland, the first woman from her country to win an Olympic medal. Dragila attempted to surpass her own world record of 15-2 1/4, set in July at the United States Olympic trials, but she just nudged the bar off the stanchions on her third attempt at 15-3.</p>
        <p>Later, she turned her back to the crowd and tossed a bouquet of flowers over her shoulder as if she were at a wedding reception instead of the Olympics.</p>
        <p>''The gold medal is beyond any world record,'' said Dragila, who lives in Pocatello, Idaho. ''To make history, I don't think there's anything better.''</p>
        <p>Except for the women's 400-meter race, which featured the Australian gold medalist Cathy Freeman, the pole vault seemed to engage the crowd more than any other event tonight. All three medalists played to the audience, raising their hands above their heads to encourage clapping as they hoisted their fiberglass poles and approached the bar.</p>
        <p>''It was piercing,'' Dragila said of the partisan crowd. ''I was just crying to get a couple of claps as I went down the runway.''</p>
        <p>Dragila, who is 29, could not have expected such a rapt audience seven years ago, when she took up pole-vaulting at the recommendation of Dave Nielson, her coach at Idaho State.</p>
        <p>In 1993 Dragila's first attempt was at six feet, which would not be considered a challenging high jump today, much less a vault.</p>
        <p>''To take up the pole vault seven years ago and to be here with a gold medal tonight is unreal,'' Dragila said. ''I just never imagined this when I first went to the pole-vault pit and tried it out. I still remember going in the air upside down, thinking to myself, 'What am I doing?'</p>
        <p>''I didn't know where I was. There were a lot of days like that in the beginning.''</p>
        <p>A native of Auburn, Calif., Dragila was a member of the 4-H club in high school and participated in such sports as goat-tying. She was also a resourceful athlete who won a college scholarship as a heptathlete. In junior college, she was discouraged from vaulting by a male athlete at her school, but she renewed her interest at Idaho State. Unnerved by the inverted positioning required in the pole vault, she began working at a gymnastics club to improve her sense of awareness in the air.</p>
        <p>She won the 1999 world championship in Seville, Spain, but women were given only half the prize money of the men. Tonight, Dragila won, and officials were not miserly with the gold medal.</p>
        <p>''To win the gold medal takes precedence over everything I've accomplished,'' Dragila said.''To get here, to the Olympic stage, is a dream come true.''</p>
