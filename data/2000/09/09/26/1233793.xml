        <p>In a sure sign that design credentials flow freely beyond borders, the Smithsonian Institution announced yesterday that the new director for its Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum is British.</p>
        <p>Paul Warwick Thompson, the director of the Design Museum in London, will be the first non-American to serve as director in the 33-year history of the museum.</p>
        <p>''It has taken us nearly a year -- an exhaustive search -- to find the right person,'' Lawrence Small, the Smithsonian's secretary, or chief executive, said in a statement. ''But it has been worth the wait.''</p>
        <p>Dianne H. Pilgrim, the museum's director since 1988, retired in January. Several other names surfaced throughout the prolonged search, including Susan Soros, the founder of the Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts and wife of the financier George Soros; Susan Yelavich, assistant director for public programs at the Cooper-Hewitt; Mark Robbins, director of design at the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington; and Paola Antonelli, a design curator at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson will be taking over a museum that faces many of the same identity issues as the one he is leaving. While the London Design Museum is in a new building known as the White Cube, and the Cooper-Hewitt is housed in the notoriously dark-paneled Andrew Carnegie mansion on the Upper East Side, both have struggled to balance the demands of presenting a permanent collection with the allure of staging more contemporary exhibitions with greater sex appeal.</p>
        <p>The Cooper-Hewitt, whose diverse collection of more than 250,000 pieces includes the largest wallpaper trove in the world, crowded shelves of Tiffany glass and the complete archive of the industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss, has also established a reputation for exhibitions that explore the moment. Crowds turned out for ''Mixing Messages,'' a 1996 review of experiments in current graphic design, and, last spring, for ''Design Culture Now,'' the museum's first triennial roundup of contemporary designs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson is no stranger to the contemporary, or the trendy. The most popular shows at the Design Museum in London have been ''The Power of Erotic Design'' and ''Ferdinand Porsche: Design Dynasty.'' Mr. Thompson has been at the Design Museum in London since it was founded in 1988 by Sir Terence Conran, who apparently felt that his mission to popularize good design needed a more serious forum than the Habitat shops. The museum has relied largely on Sir Terence, private sponsorship and year-to-year grants to survive.</p>
        <p>When he took over as director of the museum in 1992, Mr. Thompson inherited a debt of more than $:1.5 million, which he managed to turn into a slim surplus by 1994. Establishing student education and teacher-training programs have been a major focus of his tenure, Mr. Thompson said.</p>
        <p>Regarding the Smithsonian's selection, Sheila Burke, the institution's under secretary for American museums, said, ''Paul has taken the British Design Museum from a relatively small and noninfluential museum in the red to an extraordinary museum in the black.'' She added, ''And his commitment to education is extremely important to us.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Thompson, who will begin officially early next year, seemed equally comfortable with the past and the present: ''I'm not one of those who says, 'Let's forget the past collection because we find it's embarrassing,' or one of those who says, 'Let's put our heads in the sand' to avoid what's going on around at the moment. I'm going to be building a bridge uniting the historic and the contemporary.''</p>
        <p>As for the old Carnegie mansion, at 2 East 91st Street, just off Fifth Avenue, where he will be working, he sounded pleased: ''It would be easy to worry about a landmark house and think it's something you have to get around. But I think it will be just great.''</p>
