        <p>''Breast Cancer: The Complete Guide'' (third edition), by Dr. Yashar Hirshaut and Dr. Peter I. Pressman (Bantam Books, $15.95).</p>
        <p>A diagnosis of breast cancer, and indeed even the possibility that one has the disease are sources of enormous stress.</p>
        <p>But as the authors of this definitive guidebook point out, there is positive news about breast cancer: it is now stable at around 180,000 new cases in the United States each year, and the cure rate is definitely improving.</p>
        <p>In this updated edition of a highly regarded resource, the authors -- a medical oncologist and a surgical oncologist -- provide both the support and every scrap of the information that a woman needs to get the right treatment from the right doctor.</p>
        <p>The format is carefully organized and readable, covering all the details of diagnosis, treatment options, follow-up, recurrence and the social and emotional aspects of the disease.</p>
        <p>One especially valuable section demystifies the complicated system of cancer classification, standards that unfortunately vary from country to country, region to region and even from medical center to medical center.</p>
        <p>The explanations offered are easily understandable, covering essentials like the size of tumors, where they are attached, how doctors arrive at cancer's stages and how one can be assured that a lump is not cancer but a benign tumor or cyst, as 90 percent of such growths turn out to be.</p>
        <p>The chapters on surgery, which remains the prime defense against breast cancer, and on radiation are especially detailed, walking the reader from pretreatment to procedure to aftereffects and recovery.</p>
        <p>Wisely, the book has no chapter on alternative treatments for breast cancer. The authors describe that course of treatment as ''a prescription for tragedy.''</p>
        <p>Research by the authors and others has shown that nontraditional treatments are not known to work against this disease.</p>
        <p>''We don't know everything about the mysterious factors that govern why it is that one patient survives and another does not under similar medical circumstances,'' the authors write. ''We do know that imaging, enemas, macrobiotic diets, relaxation techniques, deep massage, group healing and the like are not a substitute for good medical treatment.''</p>
