        <p>The Internal Revenue Service, which came under fire in Congress three weeks ago over a legal memorandum that said the parents of a kidnapped child could not receive a tax break for the missing child in the years after the abduction, reversed itself yesterday.</p>
        <p>The original memorandum was written in response to a question posed last April to the I.R.S. by an unidentified parent whose child was kidnapped and remains missing. It said Congress allowed the parents to take an exemption for the child in the year of the abduction but denied it in subsequent years because the parents could not prove that they provided more than half of the child's support. The memo said ''the issue is not free from doubt'' and noted that the only court case that touched on the issue involved not an abduction by a stranger but the more common case of a parent taking a child from an estranged spouse.</p>

        <p>The Internal Revenue Service, which came under fire in Congress three weeks ago over a legal memorandum that said the parents of a kidnapped child could not receive a tax break for the missing child in the years after the abduction, reversed itself yesterday.</p>
        <p>The original memorandum was written in response to a question posed last April to the I.R.S. by an unidentified parent whose child was kidnapped and remains missing. It said Congress allowed the parents to take an exemption for the child in the year of the abduction but denied it in subsequent years because the parents could not prove that they provided more than half of the child's support. The memo said ''the issue is not free from doubt'' and noted that the only court case that touched on the issue involved not an abduction by a stranger but the more common case of a parent taking a child from an estranged spouse.</p>
        <p>The revised memo tiptoes around the issue of subsequent years by avoiding that language. The new memorandum states that ''we believe it should ordinarily be presumed that the parents have incurred sufficient expenses'' to qualify for the exemption as long as the child remains missing and no one else is legally qualified to take the deduction. Under the law a kidnapper, even one who is the child's parent, cannot qualify for the tax exemption.</p>
        <p>Don Roberts, an I.R.S. spokesman, said the general counsel's office intended the revised memo to be read as allowing the exemption in any future years that parents would otherwise be entitled to it.</p>
        <p>But two law professors who specialize in family tax matters said the language was not a clear reversal.</p>
        <p>John Barry Forman, a professor at the University of Oklahoma Law School who specializes in family tax matters, said the agency ''is still not giving the exemption away; a presumption doesn't go forever.''</p>
        <p>He said that he expected auditors to read the revised memorandum as making it clear that parents can take the exemption in the year of the abduction and ''could stretch it to suggest, 'O.K., go ahead and give it the next year or two,' but beyond that I would not take too much comfort'' from the memorandum.</p>
        <p>Prof. Thomas R. White of the University of Virginia Law School, who is conducting a study of taxes and divorce, said he concurred. Congress has limited the agency's discretion, he said, so it ''used some weasel words'' to get around the statute.</p>
        <p>Among those who criticized the original I.R.S. memo was Representative Jim Ramstad, Republican of Minnesota and a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. On Sept. 6, he said that ''for the I.R.S. to penalize parents of missing and abducted children is as low as it gets.</p>
        <p>''The I.R.S. ruling is anti-family, cruel and heartless,'' he added. ''On top of more pain and devastation than a family can bear, the I.R.S. is now forcing a tax hike on the families of missing children.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramstad and about two dozen other lawmakers have sponsored a bill that would allow parents in such circumstances to take the exemption until a kidnapped child's 18th birthday or until the child is declared dead. Karin Hope, Mr. Ramstad's legislative affairs director, said the Congressman did not think the fault lay with Congress and that existing law gave the I.R.S. sufficient discretion to grant the tax break without his bill.</p>
