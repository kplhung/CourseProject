        <p>CHERRY  By Mary Karr  276 pages. Viking. $24.95.</p>
        <p>At the age of 11 Mary Karr wrote in her diary: ''I am not very successful as a little girl. When I grow up, I will probably be a mess.'' Writing, however, was already providing her with the tool of detachment to cope with her sense of estrangement, and she knew, as early as then, what her vocation would be: she wanted to grow up and ''write one-half poetry and one-half autobiography.''</p>
        <p>That, of course, is exactly what Mary Karr would do. In addition to three volumes of poetry she would go on to write ''The Liars' Club,'' one of her generation's most eloquent, heart-grabbing memoirs, a pitch-perfect account of her childhood in the hardscrabble East Texas town she calls Leechfield.</p>
        <p>Published to critical hosannas in 1995, ''The Liars' Club'' chronicled, with exceptional candor and grace, the harrowing events of Ms. Karr's seventh and eighth years -- she was raped by a boy from school, molested by a baby sitter and made witness to her mother's spectacular nervous breakdown -- and it left the reader with an indelible portrait of her eccentric family and its emotional legacy of rebellion and disaffection.</p>
        <p>By the time ''Cherry,'' the sequel to ''Liars' Club,'' opens, Ms. Karr's parents have receded into the background. Her father is increasingly absent from the house, while her bohemian mother shrugs off her maternal duties: she takes the reluctant 14-year-old Mary to get birth control pills, then withdraws into a Valium-fueled dream world of her own.</p>
        <p>Because Ms. Karr's parents -- who were such towering, mythic figures in ''Liars' Club'' -- are more marginal in this volume, because the events of Ms. Karr's teenage years are less overtly dramatic than those of her childhood, ''Cherry'' lacks, at first glance, the fierce singularity of ''Liars' Club.'' And yet after a somewhat hesitant start, she proves herself as fluent in evoking the common ground of adolescence as she did in limning her anomalous girlhood.</p>
        <p>She captures, exactly, what it's like for a girl to kiss the first boy she loves, her whole body purring, his face floating in her mind's eye ''with red Magic Marker hearts scribbled around it.'' She captures, exactly, what it's like to start high school, to stride into the auditorium wearing a ''daisy-spattered dress, scanning for the right place to sit,'' while jockeying with schoolmates to establish a persona and a self. And she captures, exactly, what it's like to be a book-hungry teenager, enraptured by the words and heady ideas that offer transport from the banalities of small-town life.</p>
        <p>Later in ''Cherry'' Ms. Karr conjures, with startling verisimilitude, the glassy aerial state of being high on a combination of pharmaceuticals, where time ''blinks on and off like a strobe light,'' people take on a comic-book radiance, and ''the membrane that separates your inner world from outer phenomena'' melts and fades away.</p>
        <p>As she did in ''Liars' Club,'' Ms. Karr combines a poet's lyricism and a Texan's down-home vernacular with her natural storytelling gift. Some of her stories are nostalgic for a vanished time and place; some are scathing in their evocation of an insular world; some are just plain funny.</p>
        <p>She recounts the time she tried to commit suicide by overdosing on Anacin, then grumbling, as she waited for it to take effect, that she was forced to die to the mundane sounds of her neighbors arguing about their rosebushes. In another chapter she recounts her efforts to work a voodoo love spell on her longtime object of affection: having retrieved his family's hairbrush, she tried in vain to distinguish the hairs of her would-be lover from those of his relatives, finally grabbing them all, figuring she would let the entire household ''be nuts about me.''</p>
        <p>In many of Ms. Karr's stories, however, there is an undertow of sadness and regret. The episode in which she and a group of friends are arrested for creating a public disturbance (and later busted for drugs) is a harbinger of more serious jail terms for some of them, as well as assorted freak-outs, car wrecks and ''drug-related obliterations.''</p>
        <p>''Some kids leave elite prep schools like St. Paul's or Choate with entry into certain colleges, mastery of certain protocols,'' she writes. ''In the same way, one leaves Leechfield with raw tales on which to dine out, a sense of having escaped, and the capacity for both pathos'' and rage  ''that would make for either an excellent nun or a fearless infantry soldier.''</p>
        <p>The self-portrait Ms. Karr draws in this volume is that of a would-be outlaw, a rebel sometimes scared of her own impulses, a girl avid to grow up and yet reluctant to relinquish her remaining innocence. She was becoming, she writes, ''a worrier, a world-class insomniac, what one friend would later call a grief-seeking missile.''</p>
        <p>What she is, most insistently, is a witness to her own life: she is there, she writes, ''to watch'' and report. Even as a child, she is busy keeping a journal, transforming her experiences into prose, and she will continue to do so throughout her life.</p>
        <p>''Cherry'' begins teasingly with Ms. Karr referring to her decision to leave Leechfield and invent a new self, ''golden and unalterable,'' with her surfer pals in the promised land of California. As it turns out, this volume ends before she actually departs to take up that new life. For that story, we must wait -- and after ''Liars' Club'' and ''Cherry,'' we wait eagerly -- for what will undoubtedly be the next installment of Ms. Karr's life.</p>
