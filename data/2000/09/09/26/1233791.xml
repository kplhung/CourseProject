        <p>Wilde Woman  Everybody knows about Oscar Wilde. But what about his wife? Yes, there was a Mrs. Wilde, and her name was Constance. The couple had two children. Her story will be told at the Barbican Theater in London beginning tomorrow in the Abbey Theater of Dublin production of ''The Secret Fall of Constance Wilde.'' The play, by Thomas Kilroy, will have a limited run through Oct. 7.</p>
        <p>Out of Egypt  Educated at Eton, trained for the military at Sandhurst, W. J. Myers was commissioned in the King's Royal Rifle Corps before he served in the Zulu War in South Africa and was posted to Cairo in 1882. Two years later, at 26, he began to collect Egyptian antiquities. Upon his death in 1899 Major Myers bequeathed his collection to his old school, Eton College, in Windsor, England. Beginning today, some 150 works will be seen outside Eton's Myers Museum for the first time when ''Egyptian Art at Eton College: Selections from the Myers Museum'' go on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The show continues through Jan. 21.</p>

        <p>Jazz Transport  To get to the A train on Thursday night, it may be best to take the N or the R. Those trains let passengers off outside Carnegie Hall, where ''Take the A Train'' will be one attraction in a celebration of the music of Duke Ellington. Leading the way will be Sir Simon Rattle, conducting the Orchestra of St. Luke's and jazz soloists in performances that feature the arrangements of Luther Henderson, whose association with Ellington dates to the 1940's. Mr. Henderson's Broadway credits include ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' and ''Jelly's Last Jam.'' Thursday's program includes ''Sophisticated Lady,'' ''That Do Wah Thing,'' ''Come Sunday,'' ''Solitude,'' ''Transbluency'' and ''Far East Suite.''</p>
        <p>Romeo's Rap  Rap meets Shakespeare when the 2000-1 season at the Joyce Theater opens at 8 tonight with the New York premiere of ''Rome &amp; Jewels.'' This urban retelling of ''Romeo and Juliet'' combines Shakespeare's poetry, the rhythmic rhymes of rap, theater, music and video with the hip-hop dancing of the Rennie Harris Puremovement company. This so-called hip-hop opera includes original compositions by Darrin Ross and prerecorded samples of popular songs, some of them mixed live onstage by three disc jockeys. The engagement, which runs through Oct. 1, begins a 47-week season that includes 34 troupes from around the world performing more than 75 premieres.</p>
