      <abstract>
        <p>Dr Marylene Cloitre letter questions whether it would be a good idea to be able to erase memories (Sept 19 article)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The experiment discussed in ''Brain-Updating Machinery May Explain False Memories'' (Sept. 19) is exciting because it hints at the neurobiological processes underlying the malleability of memory. But the suggestion that the future clinical value of such findings would be to erase traumatic memories is horrifying.</p>
        <p>The idea may be appealing to a culture that uses avoidance and denial to deal with painful events. Yet, despite the pain associated with traumatic events, they represent our personal, social and political realities. In addition, as a trauma therapist and cognitive scientist, I have been impressed by how pervasively trauma leads to negative appraisals about oneself and the world, which then exist independently of the memory.</p>

        <p>A protein fix to obliterate the memory may seem like a good ''second best'' to obliterating a frightening reality, but at what cost? Would we really be better off, for example, if Holocaust survivors forgot what happened? As a culture, would we be doomed to repeat our less desirable behaviors? What an endless nightmare that would be.</p>
