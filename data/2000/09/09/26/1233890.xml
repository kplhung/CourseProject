        <p>Wayne Chrebet was at the center of one circle of reporters today, joking about the 100 electronic messages he had received on his Web site after Sunday's shocking 21-17 victory over Tampa Bay, including the one that suggested a new moniker for him: the Green Lantern.</p>
        <p>A few feet away, Curtis Martin reviewed the details of his winning touchdown pass to Chrebet, likened by Keyshawn Johnson to a flashlight compared to his aura as a star. Martin was talking about how his own defense had teased him in practice last week that he would give away the play by shucking the glove he wears on his right hand as the ball was about to be snapped. Martin successfully removed it finger by finger and was now talking about the Jets' upcoming bye week with all the glee of a teenager approaching spring break.</p>
        <p>But if the Jets were filled with jubilation over their franchise-best 4-0 start and their elite standing as one of only three undefeated teams remaining in the National Football League, there was one player in the Jets' locker room yesterday who was noticeably not smiling.</p>
        <p>Vinny Testaverde had seemed downcast in the moments after the Jets' come-from-behind victory Sunday and his mood had not improved with the trip home. Testaverde, who threw three interceptions in the game and endured an embarrassing and surprising one-series benching, was still chafing at Coach Al Groh's move to relieve him after he was halfway onto the field and alluded today to other vague problems he hoped to address during the bye week. Testaverde usually measures his words carefully, but today his irritation was plain.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't pleased at all,'' Testaverde said of his benching and the circumstances surrounding it. ''I'm really not, to be honest. There is nothing I can do about it. The moment it happened I didn't know if I was going back. I just kept saying to myself, he's making a big mistake taking me out. Because I really believe the fourth quarter belongs to me.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, I was disappointed, but not necessarily in how I was playing,'' he said of his postgame demeanor. ''Some things I don't need to discuss but they'll get worked out.''</p>
        <p>Testaverde had been on the sideline, unaware that he was about to be benched, collecting his thoughts for the next drive. He looked at the clock, and 7 minutes 57 seconds remained. He figured that all the Jets needed was a touchdown, a 2-point conversion and a field goal to tie the game. Testaverde did not know he was coming out of the game until he had already stepped on the field to start the next drive and turned to the tight ends coach Ken Whisenhunt to get the play. That is when he heard someone yelling that Ray Lucas was in the game.</p>
        <p>The person he heard was Groh, who said he became so wrapped up in being on the phone with the defensive coaches during that he had failed to tell his quarterback he was giving him a rest. Groh took responsibility today for that lapse in communication. Groh said that he yanked Testaverde because he had looked in his eyes as he came off the field after throwing his third interception and saw profound frustration. He heard it in the voices of his offensive coaches and players.</p>
        <p>''I didn't think the third quarter had gone too great,'' Groh said. ''One of the things that the opponent had feasted upon is teams getting frustrated and impatient against them. I had gone back to players on the bench during the third quarter and said, 'Don't get frustrated.' So when I sensed there was frustration, I thought we'd try to remove that frustration and not hustle right back out there.''</p>
        <p>Groh insisted again today that he planned all along to put Testaverde back in the game no matter what Lucas did on his drive. The Jets went three-and-out on that drive as Lucas threw a pass to Richie Anderson for 5 yards, was sacked for a 6-yard loss and then scrambled up the middle for 9 yards. Testaverde, who had received moral support from several of his teammates during his time on the sideline, returned. But what if Lucas had given the Jets the spark that Groh obviously sought?</p>
        <p>''I really wasn't thinking far enough ahead,'' Groh said. ''I just put Ray in and I was planning on putting Vinny in.''</p>
        <p>Did Groh sense Testaverde's anger at the decision to bench him, albeit temporarily?</p>
        <p>''I didn't try to sense anything,'' Groh said. ''I had my plan in mind. The actions and results speak for what the plan was. With the game on the line, who was in the game?''</p>
        <p>For that, Testaverde credits linebacker Bryan Cox. Testaverde said there was ''no question'' in his mind that he had been pulled for the day but that Cox went over to Groh and said, ''If we lose, we lose with Vinny.'' Cox confirmed that account. The move paid off. Testaverde completed 8 of 9 passes for 44 yards on the drive that resulted in a 6-yard touchdown pass to Martin to pull the Jets to 17-14.</p>
        <p>Groh said he did not think there was anything to smooth over with Testaverde, and compared his benching to that of left tackle Jason Fabini after he accumulated four penalties in the season opener against Green Bay. Testaverde is 16-2 in the regular season as a starter, but he has not put together four quarters of outstanding play this season. He has completed 77 of 155 passes (49.7 percent) for 911 yards with 6 interceptions and 6 touchdowns. His overall quarterback rating is 64.7. But in the fourth quarter, Testaverde has completed 26 of 38 passes (68.4 percent) for 360 yards, 4 touchdowns and only 1 interception. His rating is an astonishing 122.7.</p>
        <p>Groh was guarded in his comments about Testaverde's play but, in an early effort to tamp down any chance of a quarterback controversy, said Lucas would not get more snaps in practice than usual.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Testaverde frequently floated balls and underthrew receivers, but he pointed out today that he was 10 of 20 in a first half that he felt was marred only by the interception at Tampa Bay's 5-yard line with 22 seconds remaining.</p>
        <p>''I think I have had better performances,'' Testaverde said. ''The last four weeks, I feel what I've brought to the team in the fourth quarter is somewhat discredited by what the perception is of what I've done in the first three quarters. I'd much rather have a big fourth quarter than a big first quarter. The standard is high because of how I played in 1998.</p>
        <p>''I also said my performance will be determined by how good my team plays around me -- not necessarily only the players. People have to be accountable, players and coaches. The better we all perform, the better we all look. Period. There are things we need to take care of that will be fixed.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>WAYNE CHREBET's personal feelings after outshining KEYSHAWN JOHNSON with his winning touchdown catch on Sunday never really surfaced. But asked again about those feelings on Monday, Chrebet said, ''I think the Jets were dead-on for making the moves they made.'' Chrebet was referring to the Jets getting two first-round draft picks from Tampa Bay in the Johnson trade. Those two picks turned into JOHN ABRAHAM, who sacked quarterback SHAUN KING in the fourth quarter, causing a fumble to seal the victory, and tight end ANTHONY BECHT, who snared two passes. ''The players we have instead are making the plays for us,'' Chrebet said.</p>
        <p>Chrebet said he was delighted when he realized the Jets were going to call the halfback option play that led to the winning touchdown. ''I was thinking, 'Gosh this would be a great time to call this play.' And I'm walking in and see Vinny talking to Curtis, and I'm like 'Oh man, you guys are kidding me. This is going to happen.' And when that ball went up there, I said, 'This is it.' Then it was still up there and I was like, 'Man, please come down.' ''</p>
