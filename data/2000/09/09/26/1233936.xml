        <p>A year after Paul J. Silvester, the former Connecticut treasurer, pleaded guilty to taking bribes while in office, political insiders throughout the state are nervously waiting for the next shoe to drop in a case with the potential to tarnish both political parties.</p>
        <p>In the last year, the United States attorney in Connecticut, Stephen C. Robinson, has postponed Mr. Silvester's sentencing three times -- almost certainly because he has not finished giving investigators information about his scheme to take bribes in return for investing $527.5 million from the state pension fund in five private investment funds.</p>

        <p>A year after Paul J. Silvester, the former Connecticut treasurer, pleaded guilty to taking bribes while in office, political insiders throughout the state are nervously waiting for the next shoe to drop in a case with the potential to tarnish both political parties.</p>
        <p>In the last year, the United States attorney in Connecticut, Stephen C. Robinson, has postponed Mr. Silvester's sentencing three times -- almost certainly because he has not finished giving investigators information about his scheme to take bribes in return for investing $527.5 million from the state pension fund in five private investment funds.</p>
        <p>And despite guilty pleas from three other men, including Mr. Silvester's older brother and his brother-in-law, who helped arrange the kickbacks and launder money, no one else has been charged. A federal investigation is looking into whether other political insiders illegally benefited from investments in the pension fund.</p>
        <p>The waiting could soon end. Pressure is building inside and outside the justice system to show the results of the investigation, several lawyers close to the investigation said.</p>
        <p>The first indictments in the Silvester case are, as one of the lawyers put it last week, ''relatively imminent,'' and could be announced this week.</p>
        <p>''I would expect that something would happen by the first of October,'' another lawyer involved in the case said.  ''This case has been kicking around for a year,'' he added. ''My sense is that pressure is building to do something.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Silvester's downfall has already had an enormous impact on the state, prompting lawmakers to create new rules governing how the state's treasurer invests its pension fund. Two state committees that oversee governmental ethics and elections laws have also opened investigations into violations of their laws.</p>
        <p>The federal investigation, on the other hand, has gone on without resolution, and in utmost secrecy.</p>
        <p>Indications are that any indictments would not implicate anyone now holding elected office in Connecticut, including Mr. Silvester's former patron and the man who appointed him treasurer: Gov. John G. Rowland.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mr. Rowland's re-election campaign received tens of thousands of dollars in contributions from partners in whose investment firms Mr. Silvester invested hundreds of millions of dollars, records show. Federal investigators have subpoenaed several firms' partners to find out if they made political contributions in exchange for state investment contracts.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, the treasurer has sole authority to invest the state pension fund, which now stands at nearly $22 billion. Mr. Silvester, 38, has admitted to collecting cash and Republican campaign contributions, and even negotiating future jobs for himself and others in his office, in return for placing millions with equity funds run by investment firms. A few of those firms are run by people with close ties to prominent state Republicans, including Mr. Rowland, who has denied any knowledge of Mr. Silvester's illegal schemes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silvester pleaded guilty to six acts of racketeering, including three instances of bribery and one count of conspiring to launder money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowland, of course, may still have to worry about his image being tarnished from guilt by political association if any other high-profile Republicans are indicted. Earlier this year, Mr. Robinson subpoenaed records from Connecticut Republican Party headquarters to see whether party officials were involved in Mr. Silvester's efforts to funnel kickbacks into Republican campaigns.</p>
        <p>These questions no longer seem to worry the governor, who nonetheless declined requests to be interviewed at any length on the Sylvester matter. ''The whole Silvester mess really sounded like it was about a few people who did some bad things,'' Mr. Rowland said last Thursday as he walked toward his car near the Capitol. No one in his office has been subpoenaed in the investigation or has broken the law, he added.</p>
        <p>''We have not been involved in any way, shape or form,'' Mr. Rowland said. ''I'm not worried about it.''</p>
        <p>Though the governor is thought to be out of any immediate danger from Mr. Robinson's investigation, his Republican Party may not be. Officials in both parties acknowledge that the specter of indictments could still damage their credibility with voters.</p>
        <p>''The scandal has impacted everyone in state government,'' said Karen Hobert Flynn, the former executive director of Common Cause in Connecticut, which has used the case to advocate new state campaign finance laws. ''There's been an air of cautious nervousness because the story has not come out yet.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Silvester, a Democrat until the mid-1990's, often forged deals that included top officials in that party, he also helped enrich many Republicans, some of whom are now under federal scrutiny in connection with the $527.5 million in investments the former treasurer showered on five private equity firms based in Connecticut, Boston and Washington.</p>
        <p>The prime benefit to each of these politically connected people was money -- in the form of what are known as marketing, agency or ''finder's'' fees -- that the investment firms paid them for providing entry to Mr. Silvester's office.</p>
        <p>The fees themselves are often legal, but they can be illegal if paid to someone who did no real work or if given in exchange for financial or political favors. Last October, the current state treasurer, Denise L. Nappier, a Democrat, released a list revealing that 37 investment firms had paid about $18 million in consulting and other fees to a handful of politically connected consultants, lobbyists and lawyers since 1991. Most of those payment contracts, about $17 million worth, were struck since 1997, the year Governor Rowland appointed Mr. Silvester to the treasurer's job.</p>
        <p>Included on the list are well-connected members of both parties.</p>
        <p>Ben F. Andrews, Jr., who ran unsuccessfully for secretary of state on Mr. Rowland's Republican ticket in 1998, for instance, stands to receive more than $1 million in fees for deals he has brokered since 1991, according to state treasury records.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andrews, a consultant for several investment firms, has said that he has complied with all state lobbying laws and did nothing improper.</p>
        <p>Lisa Thiesfield, Mr. Silvester's former campaign manager and a former aide to Mr. Rowland, was given a consulting contract worth as much as $1 million by a Boston firm, Triumph Capital, several weeks after Mr. Silvester agreed to invest $200 million in pension funds with the firm, state treasury records show. Federal investigators are trying to determine if there was any improper  link between the consulting fee and Mr. Silvester's investment in the firm.</p>
        <p>Attempts to reach Ms. Thiesfield by phone were not successful, and her lawyer, George McMahon, did not return several calls.</p>
        <p>Investigators are looking into the state Republican Party's inner sanctum as well. Federal investigators have subpoenaed campaign finance records from the party's headquarters here and are examining fund-raising activities that involved the party's state chairman, Chris DePino, according to lawyers with knowledge of the investigation.</p>
        <p>In late July, The Hartford Courant reported that Mr. DePino had traveled with Mr. Silvester to Chicago in 1998 to meet with executives of an investment firm that Mr. Silvester later awarded a $75 million investment contract. Several weeks after that, several of the firm's executives and employees contributed at least $15,000 to the state party.</p>
        <p>In a brief interview on Friday, Mr. DePino refused to discuss the details of his Chicago trip, but he denied that he had done anything improper.</p>
        <p>Several high-profile Democrats also appear on Ms. Nappier's list; many of them have subsequently come under federal scrutiny for their relationships with Mr. Silvester, lawyers with knowledge of the investigation said. William A. DiBella, a former Democratic leader in the State Senate, received $349,500 from Thayer Equity Investors L.P. in 1999 for what the company described as ''documentation, negotiation and investor relations.''</p>
        <p>The United States attorney's office is investigating whether Mr. Silvester asked the firm to pay Mr. DiBella the fee and what he did to earn it, lawyers involved in the case said.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiBella did not respond to phone calls to his home. His lawyer declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Other Democrats who received large finder's fees under Mr. Silvester's auspices are the former state Democratic Party chairman, John F. Droney; Peter G. Kelly, a Hartford lawyer and prominent Democratic fund-raiser who is an architect of vice-president Al Gore's presidential campaign in Connecticut; and George C. Finley, a West Hartford lawyer. All have repeatedly said they did nothing improper.</p>
        <p>The list goes on. As the November elections draw closer, some Connecticut Democrats said they are hoping that Mr. Robinson, the United States attorney, either announces indictments soon or waits until after election day, when media attention could influence voters.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, meanwhile, since last year the state's Ethics Commission has made inquiries into about three dozen individuals and investment firms to see whether they paid or received illegal lobbying fees. Under state law, lobbyists can accept such fees from investment firms at a flat or hourly rate. Contingency fees, paid only if the firm receives a state contract, or fees that vary based on the size of the amount invested by the state, are illegal, said Alan S. Plofsky, the commission's executive director. He would not say whether the commission planned to levy fines against any person or firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andrews, the 1998 Republican candidate for secretary of state, and prominent Democrats like Mr. Droney, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Finley, were each paid lobbying or consulting fees based on the amounts of state pension fund investments their clients received, according to treasury records. Those investments are now worth about $300 million, said R. Bartley Halloran, the lawyer for the three men. But Mr. Halloran contested Mr. Plofsky's reading of state law and said his clients have done nothing illegal.</p>
