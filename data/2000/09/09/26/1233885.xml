        <p>A major fight has erupted in Congress over a proposal to compel states to adopt a more stringent standard for drunken driving, under the threat of losing millions of dollars in federal highway aid.</p>
        <p>The fight has held up agreement on a huge transportation spending bill that provides money for highways and mass transit systems and also pays for air traffic controllers, the Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates air crashes.</p>
        <p>In the Senate's $54.8 billion version of the spending bill, people whose blood alcohol level is 0.08 percent -- meaning that eight one-hundreths of one percent of the liquid in their blood stream is alcohol -- would be considered to be driving under the influence. On average, a 170-pound man reaches that level by consuming five 12-ounce beers in two hours and a 120-pound woman by drinking three 12-ounce beers in that time.</p>
        <p>States would have three years to adopt this standard under the Senate bill, which was sponsored by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, and passed in June. States that did not adopt the standard would lose 5 percent of their federal highway funds the following year, another 5 percent the next year and 10 percent the year after that.</p>
        <p>''There is no need to have another year of tragic deaths caused by .08 drunk drivers,'' Senator Lautenberg said. ''With the president's strong support, I believe we will pass the .08 law before time runs out for this Congress.''</p>
        <p>Restaurant and brewing trade groups strongly oppose the tougher standards, but in Congress such opposition is usually voiced in the relative privacy of committee rooms and in House-Senate conferences, where the final shape of legislation is often determined.</p>
        <p>Currently 18 states and the District of Columbia use the 0.08 percent criterion to define drunken driving, while 30 others, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, set their standard at 0.10 percent.</p>
        <p>For a 170-pound man, the difference between a 0.08 blood-alcohol content and a 0.10 level is generally one additional 12-ounce beer during a two-hour period. For a 120-pound woman the difference is an additional six-ounces of beer.</p>
        <p>Two states, Massachusetts and South Carolina, do not set a specific blood-alcohol level for drunken driving but leave it up the judgment of the arresting officer.</p>
        <p>House and Senate negotiators are meeting this week to resolve differences between the Senate bill and a $55.2 billion House transportation measure that does not contain the requirement of a 0.08 percent blood-alcohol limit.</p>
        <p>In addition to the restaurant industry, the proposal is also unpopular with groups like the National Governors Association and the National League of Cities, which say the federal government should not be telling them what to do.</p>
        <p>Opponents argue that it is not clear that lowering the blood-alcohol level would save as many lives as its proponents contend.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the last year in which complete statistics are available, 38 percent of all traffic fatalities nationally involved a driver who had been drinking. Of the 18 states and the District of Columbia that have adopted the 0.08 percent standard, 8 had more alcohol-related fatalities than the national average, 9 had fewer  than the national average, and 2 were at the national average.</p>
        <p>Proponents of the tougher standard, including the Clinton administration, argue that it will save 500 lives a year. They point to studies indicating that drivers show significant impairment, including slowed reflexes, at blood-alcohol levels even lower than 0.08 percent.</p>
        <p>''We've seen at least eight studies dealing with impairment that found that, on average, these laws have resulted in a 6 to 8 percent reduction in crashes,'' said Rodney Slater, the secretary of transportation.</p>
        <p>The law has also drawn support from groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which produce highly personal stories of people killed at the hands of drunken drivers.</p>
        <p>''The general population knows you're too impaired at .08,'' said Millie Webb, national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, whose 19-year-old nephew and 4-year-old daughter were killed in 1971 by a driver whose blood-alcohol level was .08 percent. ''But it's the special interests that the legislators listen to, especially in the committees.''</p>
        <p>The issue is of great importance to groups like the Wholesale Beer Distributors and the American Beverage Institute, which represents restaurants with liquor licenses. Of the 191,000 restaurants that provide table service, more than 111,000 sell alcoholic drinks.</p>
        <p>Lobbyists for the restaurant industry say the new rule would force states to concentrate on drivers who are only mildly impaired. The lobbyists also worry that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would push for even tougher standards since the agency has already said that a driver is impaired at blood alcohol levels below 0.08.</p>
        <p>''This is a campaign against drinking and driving -- any drinking and driving,'' said John Doyle, director of Communications for the American Beverage Institute. ''We have lost our focus. This is a temperance movement.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials reply that the lowering of the blood-alcohol standard is aimed at affecting the behavior of those who might be tempted to have just one more drink. Officials note that only 5 percent of people who drive while under the influence of alcohol are caught. Therefore, they argue, the only way to reduce drunken driving fatalities is to adopt a stringent standard and combine it with a public education campaign and tougher sanctions for those who are caught.</p>
