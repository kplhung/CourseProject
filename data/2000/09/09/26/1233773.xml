        <p>In a finding that is being hailed by the biotechnology industry and denounced by environmentalists, the Environmental Protection Agency has issued a preliminary report concluding that genetically modified corn is unlikely to pose a serious threat to monarch butterflies.</p>
        <p>The report, which was made public last week and focuses on crops genetically modified to produce an insecticide known as Bt, also minimized the potential for other environmental problems, including the persistence of the insecticide in the soil and the evolution of pests that can withstand it.</p>
        <p>''Although there may be individual butterflies that could be adversely affected, the overall population of monarch butterflies is not at any risk'' from Bt corn, Brian Steinwand, a spokesman for the environmental agency, said. But he said the report's conclusions were tentative and that new data were continuing to come in. Bt stands for Bacillus thuringiensis, the scientific name of the bacterium from which the toxin and the gene producing the toxin originate.</p>
        <p>The report comes after more than a year of controversy following the publication of a Cornell University study showing that Bt-containing pollen from the genetically modified corn could kill monarch butterfly caterpillars in the laboratory. That finding turned the monarch into a symbol of fragile nature threatened by biotechnology. Opponents criticized the environmental agency for approving the corn, which was planted on 20 million acres last year.</p>
        <p>The report is a major step in a continuing re-evaluation of the safety of Bt crops that will culminate in a decision next fall to discontinue or reapprove their widespread commercial use. Meanwhile, the report noted, companies are phasing out Bt corn varieties that produce a particularly toxic pollen -- those that carry the genetically engineered DNA known as Event 176. The change could help reduce risks to monarchs and other nonpest insects.</p>
        <p>Dr. Val Giddings, vice president for food and agriculture at Biotechnology Industry Organization, which represents companies that sell seed for genetically modified crops and other biotech products, praised the report. He called the review rigorous, and said it confirmed that biotech crops ''pose no adverse health or environmental problems.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Jane Rissler, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, which has been critical of the agency's handling of Bt crops, said:  ''We were disappointed. It's clear that there are insufficient data.''</p>
        <p>Because studies showing actual effects of Bt corn pollen on monarch butterfly populations in the wild are still in progress, the report relied instead on indirect studies that, like the original Cornell research, simply indicate a greater or lesser likelihood of risk to the monarchs from the pollen. Data considered include the toxicity of different strains of Bt corn and the distance that toxic pollen can move within and beyond a cornfield.</p>
        <p>In addition to arguing against risks to monarchs, the report also disputed the significance of other studies that had suggested the potential for unexpected environmental threats from Bt crops. For example, some studies have indicated that the Bt toxin from these plants can persist much longer than had been thought possible in the soil. Other studies have indicated that pest caterpillars that have eaten the Bt toxin can sicken the beneficial insect predators that eat them.</p>
        <p>In one of few concessions to critics, the report suggests that more can be done to prevent the evolution of pests that are resistant to the Bt toxin. Bt toxin has traditionally been sprayed on fields by farmers. The arrival of genetically engineered Bt potatoes, corn and cotton that continually produce Bt in their tissues raised the possibility that insects would be exposed more often and for longer periods to the toxin. Such exposure could speed the evolution of pests that are resistant to the insecticide, a development that would render Bt useless. Produced naturally by a bacterium, Bt toxin is an important insecticide for organic farmers and one of the few available for their use.</p>
        <p>Over the next year, Mr. Steinwand said the agency would continue to reassess Bt crops. He said half the new research that the agency had requested from scientists to assess the potential threat of Bt corn to monarchs had not yet been submitted to the agency.</p>
        <p>In just the last month, he said, the E.P.A. was surprised to learn from researchers that monarch caterpillars could be found in the middle of cornfields, the place where most of the toxic pollen from Bt corn plants ends up landing.</p>
        <p>''That told us, Hey wait a minute,'' said Mr. Steinwand. ''We're still waiting for a considerable amount of data.''</p>
