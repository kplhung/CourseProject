        <p>The comptrollers of the State and City of New York, representing pension funds for public employees that are among the largest shareholders in AT&amp;T, have requested a meeting with its chairman to discuss the company's long-term prospects.</p>
        <p>In a letter to C. Michael Armstrong, AT&amp;T's chairman and chief executive, H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, and Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, also expressed concern over AT&amp;T's sagging share price and strategies the company's management is considering to improve its fortunes.</p>
        <p>The move by the public officials highlights the distress with which some of AT&amp;T's largest institutional shareholders have witnessed an erosion of their investments in one of the the nation's leading telecommunications companies.</p>
        <p>Battered by concern over the relatively slow growth of revenue from services like long-distance calling, AT&amp;T's share price has declined more than 50 percent this year. Yesterday, AT&amp;T stock fell to a 52-week-low of $28.63 before rebounding slightly to close at $28.81.</p>
        <p>The New York State Common Retirement Fund holds more than 11.8 million shares of AT&amp;T's common stock, while the New York Pension Funds and Systems hold about 13.3 million shares of common stock. Together, they own less than 1 percent of the company's outstanding shares, according to information AT&amp;T made available at the end of June.</p>
        <p>Still, the pension funds are substantial investors in the company. For example, John C. Malone, the former chairman of Tele-Communications, who is the largest individual shareholder, owned about 32 million shares at the end of the second quarter, only about 7 million more than the New York pension funds' total.</p>
        <p>At AT&amp;T's annual strategy session late last week, the company's board reportedly discussed a variety of strategies, including an alliance with British Telecommunications; an acquisition of Nextel Communications, a wireless carrier; and the issuance of a new tracking stock. None of these options seemed to inject optimism into investors' perception of the company.</p>
        <p>''As long-term investors, we want to be assured that the options are being considered to promote growth and stability in the long term, and not simply to produce a short-term boost in the stock price,'' Mr. McCall and Mr. Hevesi said in their letter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Armstrong received the letter but declined to comment on its contents or whether a meeting with the pension funds had been scheduled.</p>
        <p>''We understand Mr. McCall and Mr. Hevesi have concerns about our share price within a situation affecting not just our company but the sector as a whole,'' said David Couette, an AT&amp;T spokesman. The company is concerned, too, he said.</p>
