        <p>Dwight Gooden's four-month metamorphosis from out-of-work pitcher pondering retirement to Yankees fill-in starter might have qualified as a near-miracle, until he revealed again last night that he is very mortal.</p>
        <p>Two towering Detroit home runs and two and two-thirds innings into the Yankees' final home game of the regular season, Gooden had authorized a debacle that only unraveled more painfully in a damp and chilly September night not to remember.</p>
        <p>Gooden had switched places with his longtime friend David Cone, from bullpen to the rotation, for last night's start at Yankee Stadium, and both Cy Young Award winners wound up with outings to forget in a 15-4 thrashing by the Tigers. But while the 35-year-old Gooden should make the postseason roster as a reliever, the 37-year-old Cone's future remains in doubt.</p>
        <p>Having the worst season of his career, and still affected by pain from a dislocated left shoulder, Cone relieved in the fourth inning of a game the Tigers led, 5-1.</p>
        <p>He allowed four more runs before leaving with one out in the fifth. Gooden yielded 5 runs and 6 hits, making their combined numbers : 9 runs, 11 hits, 5 walks, 1 wild pitch, 1 strikeout.</p>
        <p>''The weather was tough for Cone, it may have contributed to crankiness in his left shoulder,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ''I don't think he was ever very comfortable and he was obviously not very effective.''</p>
        <p>Gooden's performance did not discourage Torre. ''He's given us a lot more positive outings than negative outings, so I don't put much into what happened today,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>The Yankees fell to 4-8 this season against Detroit. But with second-place Toronto's loss to Tampa Bay last night, New York's clinching number fell to 2 in the American League East.</p>
        <p>Gooden (6-5) was charged with the loss, his first in five Yankee starts.  Cone just got more demoralized, leaving with one out in the fifth and the score 9-3. ''I was just favoring my left shoulder and it's not exceedingly painful,'' Cone, a right-hander, said. ''I just was not very good tonight.''</p>
        <p>There were few who were for the Yankees, with the regular exceptions. Derek Jeter had three more hits and an infield single in the fifth was his 1,000th career hit; he went 13 for 18 in the series. David Justice hit his career-best 41st home run, in the fourth inning. He has hit 20 home runs since being acquired from Cleveland, making him the the first American League player to hit 20 or more homers with two teams in the same season.</p>
        <p>But there was nothing noteworthy for Gooden or Cone.</p>
        <p>''I just didn't have it in sync today,'' said Gooden, making his first start since Aug. 1 and pitching for the first time since he relieved Cone in Toronto last Wednesday. ''I felt good warming up and it was different not coming out of the bullpen.''</p>
        <p>Gooden's troubles began in the second inning, when Damion Easley teed off on an 0-1 slider that hung over the plate, the ball sailing out just over the left field wall. It gave the Tigers a 2-1 lead.</p>
        <p>The third inning finished Gooden. He walked the leadoff batter, Rich Becker, and Juan Encarnacion was robbed of an extra-base hit when Bernie Williams made a diving catch in right-center field as he slid to the wet grass. But it only saved one run.</p>
        <p>Two pitches later, Bobby Higginson lofted a 1-0 slider into the upper deck in right and it was 4-1.</p>
        <p>Two singles and another run later, Gooden was relieved by Craig Dingman, ending his shortest start as a Yankee this year, and his shortest outing since May 8, when he went two and a third innings with Tampa Bay. ''I want to use him out of the bullpen,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>When Cone entered in the fourth it was his first relief appearance after 143 starts, the first since Oct. 4, 1992, in which he faced the Tigers for the Blue Jays. That night, he pitched two scoreless innings. Last night had none of the same symmetry, which was apparent immediately, when Cone walked his first batter.</p>
        <p>After Cone got Becker to fly to left, Justice tracked down Encarnacion's high fly to left and even had the ball in the pocket of his glove before dropping it. Encarnacion reached second with a double. Cone walked Higginson intentionally and then gave up a sacrifice fly to Dean Palmer, making the score 6-1. By the time Cone left in the fifth, his team was trailing, 9-3, and question marks surrounded him.</p>
        <p>He is a free agent after what he termed a miserable season and his spot on apostseason roster is in doubt.</p>
        <p>''I want to include him because he's important for this organization,'' Torre said. ''Physically we want him to feel good. That right now is the question.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>After throwing without pain in his bruised right leg in his off-day workout yesterday, ROGER CLEMENS plans to make his normal start Thursday. Clemens bruised his right hamstring when he was hit by a ground ball Saturday. . . . The crowd of 32,701 last night gave the Yankees a season total of 3,227,657 for 80 home games (one rainout will not be made up). In 81 games last year, the total was 3,292,343. . . . Tickets for a possible three home games in the first round of the playoffs next week will go on sale tomorrow at the Yankee Stadium advance ticket window under a wristband distribution procedure starting at 8 a.m. Seats can also be ordered, starting at noon, through TicketMaster at (212) 307-1212 and the Internet, at www.yankees.com.</p>
