        <p>With Democrats growing more confident about their chances of regaining control of the Senate this fall, several colleagues of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman are pressuring him to let another Connecticut Democrat seek his seat so that the party will not lose it if he becomes vice president.</p>
        <p>Even though he is campaigning as Vice President Al Gore's running mate, Mr. Lieberman is also seeking a third term in the United States Senate, which he is entitled to do under state law.</p>
        <p>Democratic strategists and senators said that two senior Democrats, Harry Reid of Nevada and Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, have approached Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, to ask Mr. Lieberman to step aside. Mr. Daschle has rebuffed their appeals, aides and senators said.</p>
        <p>Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, who heads the Democrats' re-election efforts, said this month on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' that the ''right decision'' for Mr. Lieberman would be to step aside.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Lieberman wins his Senate campaign and the vice presidency, he will give up his Senate seat and Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, will be able to appoint his replacement. That would cost the Democrats a Senate seat, at a time when they are trying to narrow the Republicans' 54-to-46 advantage. Under state law, the interim senator appointed by the governor would serve for two years, with a replacement chosen in the 2002 general election.</p>
        <p>''There's a huge worry that we could pick up four seats and then lose the Senate because Joe hasn't stepped down,'' said one Senate Democrat who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''It's one of the main topics among Democratic senators.''</p>
        <p>If the Democrats were to pick up four seats, and a Democratic administration were in place, the party could control narrow votes in the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has explained his decision to continue his Senate campaign by saying that there would not be enough time to hold a primary so voters could choose a replacement candidate.</p>
        <p>Instead the replacement would be chosen by the 72-member state Democratic Central Committee.</p>
        <p>Under state law, Mr. Lieberman has until Oct. 27 to change his mind.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's intent to seek a third term scared away all of the best-known, best-liked potential Republican Senate candidates, leaving the field to Philip Giordano, the mayor of Waterbury, who lacks money and name recognition.</p>
        <p>Among the Democrats mentioned most often is Richard Blumenthal, the state attorney general who could step in and be heavily favored to beat Mr. Giordano.</p>
        <p>The oddity of Mr. Lieberman's dual political identity was on full display today, as he shifted for a day from the national campaign to stump in Connecticut for his re-election. Responding to questions about it, he  referred to polls that show voters by a slight margin oppose his dual candidacy. He and the voters have ''agreed to disagree'' on that point, he said, while noting that polls show him with an overwhelming lead over Mr. Giordano.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Senate Democrats say their hopes of recapturing control have been buoyed by new polls -- which Republicans have quickly challenged with surveys of their own -- showing Democratic candidates closing the gap in states the party had discounted or even written off, including Montana, Pennsylvania and Nevada. These hopes also shot up when former Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia, a Democrat, was named to replace Senator Paul Coverdell, a Republican who died in July.</p>
        <p>This boost also coincides with the post-convention surge enjoyed by the Gore-Lieberman ticket against their  Republican rivals, Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' strong showing in the presidential race, however, has fueled fears among Mr. Lieberman's colleagues. While few if any have made their concerns known directly to the senator, several Democrats spoke to a reporter today on the condition of anonymity, knowing their remarks would reach him.</p>
        <p>''I wish Joe would step aside,'' said one Democratic senator. ''As his likelihood of success becomes more apparent, that seat of his could make a difference.''</p>
        <p>Said another Senate Democrat: ''I would certainly say he should take a hard look at it in 10 to 12 days.''</p>
        <p>Senator Evan Bayh, an Indiana Democrat, said, ''I have heard a lot of chatter about it, but ultimately it's up to him and his conscience.''</p>
        <p>An aide to Mr. Lieberman would say only that the senator ''has felt great support from his colleagues,'' and referred all other questions to Mr. Daschle.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Daschle defended Mr. Lieberman's decision:  ''He's had a very impressive record in the Senate for 12 years. To throw away something that's a sure thing, another term in the Senate, for the possibility of a new position of vice president is a choice and decision that only he can make.''</p>
        <p>As he campaigned in Connecticut today, Mr. Lieberman faced a barrage of questions about his balancing act.</p>
        <p>Might he change his mind? Didn't he worry about a Republican taking his seat? Was he hedging his bets against a possible loss by Vice President Al Gore?</p>
        <p>The senator handled the questions calmly, saying that while the people of Connecticut are split over his decision, polls show that they overwhelmingly favor his re-election. Last week, a Quinnipiac College poll showed that 46 percent of voters oppose Mr. Lieberman's double campaign and 45 percent support it. But he enjoys an extraordinary 80 percent approval rating and leads his Republican opponent, Mr. Giordano, 72 percent to 19 percent.</p>
        <p>''Look, I understand this is an unusual situation and I appreciate the questions that people in Connecticut are asking,'' he said, after a stop at the Harbour Park Restaurant in Middletown.</p>
        <p>''I and my extended family in Connecticut, that is, the people of Connecticut have agreed to disagree, but ultimately, I'm heartened, deeply heartened, and grateful by their response in the polls.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has called for a change in the state law, so that a special election would be held next year, rather than 2002. Mr. Rowland said last week that he would veto such a bill, but that, Mr. Lieberman insisted, had not shaken his resolve.</p>
        <p>''It does not change my view, and hopefully, the Legislature and the governor will work on this if it becomes necessary to work on it next year,'' he said. ''I still think that the best course is for there to be a special election, should I be fortunate enough to be elected vice president, there should be a special election early next year, giving enough time for party nominations, full open list of candidates, primaries if that's required, and then a good debate and election of a successor.''</p>
        <p>As if to underscore his dual demands, Mr. Lieberman took time out from a day ostensibly devoted to his re-election to attend three fund-raisers for the Democratic National Committee, which raised more than $3 million.</p>
