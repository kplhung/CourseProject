        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH</p>
        <p>From remarks today at Bethany Elementary School in Beaverton, Ore.:</p>
        <p>''There's too many of our schools not meeting the challenge. Expectations are not high enough. Performance is not strong enough. And our leaders are not bold enough to reverse this slide. . . .</p>
        <p>Texas has ended the education recession. And as president, I intend to end the education recession in every public school in America. The issue of education provides one of the biggest differences, one of clearest choices in this campaign for the presidency. With the reforms in Texas, reading scores have gone up and under this administration, national reading scores have gone down. Texas is closing the achievement gap between rich and poor and Anglo and minority. Under Vice President Gore, the achievement gap in America has grown wider.</p>
        <p>Texas has spent money well and wisely, with results to show for it. Under the vice president and the administration, money has been spent without accountability or results.''</p>
