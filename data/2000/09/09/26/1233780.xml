        <p>Sometime between last May and tonight, Vince Carter developed a serrated edge on the court. Gone is the cuddly Toronto Raptors acrobat with the postgame disposition of a koala and the ''Inside Stuff'' smile.</p>
        <p>At the Olympic Games, of all places, he has decided to share with the world an unmerciful, take-no-prisoners side of himself. Carter's performance here has come with preening after a score, altercations with inferior players, jeering from Australian fans.</p>
        <p>Who knew that the guy whose mother put encouraging notes on his hotel pillow after a playoff loss had any outlaw in him?</p>
        <p>But Carter has also provided splendid athletic moments, too, breathtaking plays to make everyone forgive and forget. And tonight, no transgression could stop the crowd at the Dome in Olympic Park from rising and cheering the most spectacular dunk anyone could recall in international competition.</p>
        <p>With 16 minutes left in the second half of Team USA's 106-94 victory over France, Carter intercepted a lazy behind-the-back pass a few feet in front of the midcourt line. All that stood between his 6-foot-6 frame and the rim was Frederic Weis, a gawky, 7-2 Frenchman trying to draw an offensive foul some four feet from the basket on the left side.</p>
        <p>Carter took one power dribble and rose. And rose. And rose. ''I felt like I took off a long way out and wasn't sure if I was going to make it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He did. Carter somehow leaped over Weis, using the Frenchman's head for balance as he slammed the ball with his body splayed in spread-eagle fashion. He resembled a boy leapfrogging a parking meter. The rim and the building shook.</p>
        <p>''Le facial,'' a member of French news media said.</p>
        <p>''He joked with me at the end, 'Did you see that dunk I put in your face?' '' said Weis, taking the harsh postgame humor in stride. ''I didn't see. Was too quick. I was not moving, trying to take a charge. But he jumped over me. It's unbelievable.''</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Why on me?' I'm going to be the poster dunk and I don't like this. He started laughing.''</p>
        <p>The Americans were impressed as well. ''The only time I've ever seen a play like that is when I jumped over my 4-year-old son on one of those Nerf-ball baskets,'' United States Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.</p>
        <p>Jason Kidd, the Team USA point guard, said: ''I think everybody was in awe, and nobody thought he was going to attempt that. To me, that was probably the greatest play in basketball I've ever seen.''</p>
        <p>Carter's liftoff and splashdown over Weis, the much-maligned Frenchman whom the Knicks shockingly took with the 15th pick in the 1999 National Basketball Association draft, obscured another mediocre outing from Team USA. France's 12-point margin of defeat was the second-lowest margin of victory by a team of American professional players since the international basketball federation began allowing N.B.A. players to compete in 1992. Last Thursday, Lithuania lost 85-76 to the Americans and trailed by only 5 with 1 minute 9 seconds remaining.</p>
        <p>Team USA, which finished 5-0 atop Group A, will meet Russia (3-2), the fourth-seeded team in Group B, in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. But in incremental ways, the Americans continue to show their fallibility against patient and physical teams. Tim Hardaway and Shareef Abdur-Rahim both got into altercations with French players, drawing technical fouls and the ire of the crowd.</p>
        <p>It is not always the United States instigating the trouble. Grabbing, clutching and using their forearms, many international players clearly hold this collection of N.B.A. All-Stars in much less esteem than they did their Olympic predecessors.</p>
        <p>''The international players are getting better because there are more players coming to the N.B.A. to play,'' Kidd said. ''The fear of the Dream Team is gone; '92 was the best team ever assembled. Now guys aren't as scared or afraid to play against us and you can see that in the first five games.''</p>
        <p>Canada (4-1) pulled off perhaps its greatest international upset tonight, knocking off the defending world champion, Yugoslavia (4-1), 83-75, to win Group B and avoid the Americans at least until the gold medal game. Steve Nash scored 26 points.</p>
        <p>Australia (3-2) was also the beneficiary of good fortune after a 91-80 comeback victory over Spain (1-4). By taking third place in Group B, the host nation will meet Italy (3-2) in the quarterfinals. The Australians also set themselves up to avoid meeting the United States until the gold medal game.</p>
        <p>Lithuania (3-2) meets Yugoslavia in the other quarterfinal, with the winner most likely meeting the Americans in the semifinals.</p>
        <p>There are still indelible moments, however, when the game is more of a show than a contest. When Carter dunked over Weis, he said he felt as if he was literally flying.</p>
        <p>''I went to track and field last night and I was telling my mom that I was itching to do it,'' he said. ''I just wanted to try it, just to say I did it.''</p>
