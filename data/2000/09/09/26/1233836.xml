        <p>Another executive has departed Janus Capital, the Denver company that is the nation's fifth-largest manager of mutual funds. Last month, James Craig, the respected chief investment officer, said he would leave to manage money for a charitable foundation. Yesterday, a federal filing disclosed that the chief financial officer was also leaving.</p>
        <p>The executive, Steven R. Goodbarn, who was also a vice president at Janus, resigned effective yesterday. ''Our understanding is that he's going to spend time with his family and then pursue another job,'' said Jane Ingalls, a spokeswoman for Janus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodbarn, 43, had been with the company since 1992. Janus is a unit of Stilwell Financial, a collection of financial holdings spun off earlier this year from Kansas City Southern Industries. The role of chief financial officer is not considered nearly as pivotal as Mr. Craig's position, since the firm is intensely focused on its investment management group and is not public in its own right.</p>
        <p>Still, the departure comes at a tumultuous time for the firm. Stilwell was spun off over the objections of Janus executives, who preferred to be spun off as an independent entity.</p>
        <p>And the firm's funds have not performed as well as they did in 1998 and 1999. Nonetheless, Janus has been inundated with the largest net sales in the fund industry this year, leading it to close to new investment 5 of its 16 equity mutual funds</p>
