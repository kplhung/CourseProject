        <p>Shares of Sotheby's Holdings rose more than 15 percent yesterday after the board of the beleaguered auction house agreed to pay $256 million to settle a class-action claim that it colluded with Christie's to fix commissions charged to buyers and sellers.</p>
        <p>The board's action, taken Sunday, also set off speculation that the company was more ripe than ever for a takeover.</p>
        <p>Shares of Sotheby's rose $3.13, to $23.44.</p>
        <p>A. Alfred Taubman, the company's largest shareholder and former chairman, agreed to pay $156 million of the auction house's settlement cost. Of the $100 million Sotheby's has to pay, $50 million can be in the form of certificates offered like lines of credit to future sellers.</p>
        <p>As part of the agreement, which is now before a federal judge for review, the privately held Christie's also has to pay $256 million.</p>
        <p>Investors have had little interest in Sotheby's stock for some time. Its price nosedived after a federal investigation into collusive practices gathered steam last January.</p>
        <p>''It was a stock no one cared about yesterday,'' said George Sutton, a managing director of Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. ''But today they do because now that there's been a settlement something has to happen to the Taubman shares.''</p>
        <p>Speculation that Sotheby's might be sold has been rife ever since Mr. Taubman, a 75-year-old real estate magnate and the majority shareholder, resigned as chairman in February amid accusations that he set commission fees with his one-time counterpart at Christie's, Sir Anthony Tennant. Sotheby's and Christie's are part of the ongoing federal antitrust investigation.</p>
        <p>While Sotheby's may still have another big check to write to settle its case with the Department of Justice, officials at the auction house said they believed that sum would not be as large as the $256 million payment.</p>
        <p>The stock is far from its high last spring of $46.75 a share, but Ronald Baron, chairman and chief executive of Baron Capital, the company's largest outside shareholder, with a $500 million holding, said he was pleased with yesterday's settlement.</p>
        <p>''It removes a cloud from the company,'' he said. ''But I don't think I've made much so far. I bought the stock for a little over $20 a share.''</p>
        <p>James M. Meyer, director of research at Janney Montgomery Scott, the Philadelphia investment firm, said that despite its current woes, Sotheby's has many valuable assets.</p>
        <p>''It's one of the two trusted entities in the art world and a company with access to the richest people in the world,'' he said. ''The message now is that the shoe that hasn't dropped -- the criminal side -- is about to.'' This, he said, could precipitate a change in ownership. ''Shareholders are eager to find somebody else to run the business,'' he said. ''Like the Yankees, it's a franchise worth owning.''</p>
