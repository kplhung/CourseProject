        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Amazing! In one more example of how children rule, the article 'A Trend on the Sidewalks, and in the E.R.'' (Sept. 12) expresses concern for the increase in injuries as a result of children on their new scooters, but it doesn't mention the danger to pedestrians.</p>
        <p>While I share the concern for the children, I'm also aware of the number of times that I and others have had to dodge these careening contraptions and their inconsiderate riders.</p>

        <p>Children should have fun, but not at the expense of those of us using the city's sidewalks for their intended purpose. Perhaps these toys should be relegated to specific areas in the playgrounds and parks. Or at least, parents, please teach your children consideration for those of us who would rather walk than ride.</p>
