        <p>Lawmakers who spent most of today examining the high costs of policing in Nassau County came away with one overriding sentiment: the proposed labor contracts that County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta has negotiated with two police unions are all but dead.</p>
        <p>And if those contracts are not approved, county officials will have only a month to find the roughly $35 million that Mr. Gulotta has said his two proposed contracts would save the county through 2004.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, struck tentative deals this month with the Police Benevolent Association and the Detectives Association Inc. that include cumulative raises of 22 percent over the next five years.</p>
        <p>But Democratic and Republican county legislators said today that with Nassau's current fiscal crisis, when Mr. Gulotta is proposing a roughly 4 percent increase in property taxes and the layoffs of more than 350 county employees in his 2001 budget, it is unfair -- and politically impractical -- to grant such steep raises.</p>
        <p>Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the presiding officer of the County Legislature, said she would like to see new deals negotiated. ''At this point in Nassau County, I don't see any way we pass it,'' she said. ''On an equity argument, it's dead.''</p>
        <p>Today, the first day of legislative committee hearings on the budget, Ms. Jacobs said a proposed contract that Mr. Gulotta negotiated with the county correction officers was more realistic. The proposal would give those officers a 28 percent raise over seven years. But, Ms. Jacobs said, those officers have not had a raise in three years, and their proposed increases are more in line with those of civil service workers.</p>
        <p>Nassau County police officers, already among the highest paid in the nation, now earn $73,000 a year as an average base salary after six years on the force, or $90,000 in total annual pay, including overtime and other pay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta negotiated the proposed raises in return for a number of union concessions that he said would offset the increase in pay. In his 2001 budget plan, Mr. Gulotta factored in the savings he said those concessions would bring: $28.4 million from police officers and $7 million from detectives.</p>
        <p>He needs the savings to balance the cash-strapped county's budget and keep a state oversight board, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, from seizing control of the county's finances.</p>
        <p>But legislators were fuming today after a closed-door meeting with Martin Scheinman, who mediated the proposed contracts, and the county's labor counsel, Peter Bee, because they said the two men indicated that the contract proposals were still changing.</p>
        <p>''Every issue we brought up, they said, 'Oh, that was addressed in the latest draft,' which we don't have,'' said Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader of the Legislature. ''I don't even know if these contracts are now working documents anymore.''</p>
