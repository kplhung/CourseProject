        <p>Campaigning in Florida, where as many as 40 percent of this November's voters may be 60 or older, Vice President Al Gore promised today to strengthen sanctions against health maintenance organizations that pull out of the Medicare market and to eliminate Medicare copayments and deductibles for a variety of preventive tests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore unveiled those proposals in a speech in St. Petersburg that  opened a weeklong discussion of Medicare policy, an issue that is particularly potent in Florida. Before flying here to attend several fund-raisers, Mr. Gore used his speech to convey his stark differences on the issue with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a comparison that illustrates the broader philosophical differences between the two campaigns. Along those lines, Mr. Gore also drew attention to a five-year-old interview in which Mr. Bush expressed support for the deep Medicare cuts championed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides provided reporters with a videotape of the interview on Oct. 19, 1995, by a television station in Austin, Tex., in which Mr. Bush commended that year's House Republican plan to cut $270 billion over seven years from Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly. The proposal died after a prolonged battle with Congressional Democrats and the White House that prompted two government shutdowns.</p>
        <p>''Elderly people will not suffer as a result of this plan,'' Mr. Bush said in the interview with KXAN. ''It's going to make the plan solvent. And Republicans will be heralded, not only for saving Medicare, but at the same time for having the political courage to balance the budget.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides then made him available for an interview with The New York Times, in which he said that Mr. Bush's comments were ''very revealing of his basic attitude toward Medicare'' and belied his assertion that he was a new kind of Republican.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't like it,'' Mr. Gore said. ''He disagrees with its basic premise and he is looking for any politically viable opportunity to gut it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore then said Mr. Bush would do ''virtually the same thing to Medicare that Gingrich proposed: raising premiums, taking money out of Medicare for a tax cut that goes mainly to the wealthy, forcing seniors into H.M.O.'s, privatizing Medicare.''</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman, said Mr. Bush had made it clear with his own 10-year plan to restructure Medicare, at a cost of $198 billion, that he was committed to the program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's proposal, issued earlier this month, would allow private insurers to compete with the government to provide a variety of coverage options, some of which could include prescription drug benefits.</p>
        <p>''His proposals will strengthen Medicare so it will be just as successful in the future as it has been in the past for millions of seniors,'' Mr. Bartlett said.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Bush's comments in 1995, Mr. Bartlett said, ''What is important here is not what Governor Bush said about a plan five years ago that wasn't even his. What's important is what he says about his plan today.''</p>
        <p>Today's trip was Mr. Gore's fourth to Florida since the Democratic convention last month, and his ninth since early March. But despite that sign that Mr. Gore is competing aggressively for the state's 25 electoral votes, his campaign admits that it is being badly outspent here on television advertising.</p>
        <p>Karl Koch, a senior consultant to the campaign in Florida, said that the Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee had spent an estimated $2.2 million on advertising from Sept. 11-19, compared with  only $330,000 by the Gore campaign. The Democratic National Committee, which had been advertising in three Florida media markets, is currently off the air but plans to return, Mr. Koch said.</p>
        <p>A senior campaign official said today that either Mr. Gore or his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, would travel to Florida each week between now and Election Day. The official also said the campaign would increase its advertising and ground troops in the state.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign considers Medicare a major issue partly because it plays well in key states like Florida that have large elderly populations. But Mr. Gore's strategists also know that with 39 million beneficiaries nationwide, a number that is projected to more than double by 2035, Medicare is a significant concern for a large cross-section of voters. Indeed, the vice president also used the Medicare issue to batter his opponent in the Democratic primaries, former Senator Bill Bradley.</p>
        <p>In his speech in St. Petersburg, delivered to a crowd of several thousand people, most of them elderly, Mr. Gore vowed that ''the heart of my agenda is a rock-solid commitment to Medicare.''</p>
        <p>Reading from a teleprompter, Mr. Gore explained the key elements of his Medicare proposals: to protect the projected $360 billion, 10-year Medicare surplus by placing it in a secure fund; to add a voluntary prescription drug benefit at a cost of $338 billion; and to invest $40 billion in reimbursement for nursing homes, teaching hospitals, rural hospitals, home health agencies and rehabilitative services.</p>
        <p>Those were among the proposals that were repackaged in a 74-page booklet on Medicare that was released by Mr. Gore today, three weeks after he issued a 191-page synopsis of his economic plan.</p>
        <p>But the booklet also outlined Mr. Gore's new proposals for an array of sanctions against H.M.O.'s that pull out of the Medicare market, a growing problem. Mr. Gore would prevent H.M.O.'s that drop coverage of Medicare recipients from returning to that market for four years, double the existing sanction of two years.</p>
        <p>He also would require H.M.O.'s to sign up Medicare beneficiaries for two years instead of the current one year. And the vice president would ban H.M.O.'s from the Medicare market if they showed a persistent pattern of cherry-picking the least expensive recipients by offering coverage in relatively healthy communities while not offering it in less healthy ones.</p>
        <p>''We will no longer just accept the rising wave of H.M.O.'s dropping seniors and denying them coverage, all to enhance their bottom line,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>Another new proposal would eliminate existing Medicare copayments and deductibles for preventive services like hepatitis B vaccinations, colorectal and prostate cancer screenings, mammographies, pelvic exams and bone mass measurements. Gore aides said those changes would cost $8 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>''No seniors should be priced out of tests that could save their lives,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
