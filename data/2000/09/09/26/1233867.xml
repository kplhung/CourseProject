        <p>WELCOME to the Lincoln Bedroom! This room has a special place in the history of the nation; and, more important, in the history of the Clinton family. It's where our best friends stay. We can't always be here to welcome you personally, but whether you're spending the night or taking a Junior Donor Nap, you'll always find clean towels and warm hospitality. So relax! You're family.</p>
        <p>For your safety and comfort, please keep your name tag clearly visible when walking in the hall. At night we don't always recognize our friends, especially the new ones from New York, and the Secret Service agents react forcefully if one of us screams for help.</p>

        <p>WELCOME to the Lincoln Bedroom! This room has a special place in the history of the nation; and, more important, in the history of the Clinton family. It's where our best friends stay.

You're family.</p>
        <p>For your safety and comfort, please keep your name tag clearly visible when walking in the hall. At night we don't always recognize our friends, especially the new ones from New York, and the Secret Service agents react forcefully if one of us screams for help.</p>

        <p>''Profiles in Generosity.'' True stories of daring campaign donors who changed the course of history.</p>
        <p>''But Do They Like Me for Myself?'' The self-doubts of the affluent are examined by Anthony Robbins. Let the motivational guru who counseled Bill teach you the secret of self-acceptance: ''As long as you've got money, why not be liked for it?''</p>

        <p>A Room With a Rich Tradition.</p>
        <p>This very room, Abraham Lincoln said, put him ''in a New York state of mind.'' He often came here late at night to ask guests for donations for the 1864 Senate race in New York. He was determined to stop a ruthless, baby-faced politician from Long Island who was running with a plan to ban soft money contributions; including ones in this very bedroom!</p>

        <p>The plush Presidential Bathrobe in the  closet is yours to keep. ($15,000 has been charged to your account.) You are welcome to take your toothbrush, shampoo or any other toiletry item with a Presidential Seal. ($150 per item; $500 if personally autographed by President.) Also available are the Lincoln Bedroom's hand-carved bed, lamps and other furnishings. (For pricing, contact Democratic National Committee.)</p>
