        <p>Sounding his new slogan intended to raise anxieties about the nation's well-being, Gov. George W. Bush accused the Clinton administration today of helping create an ''education recession'' in which minority and low-income students were routinely allowed to fail.</p>
        <p>Seeking to draw a clear link between the nation's future economic health and the quality of its schools, Mr. Bush asserted that the nation faced a reading crisis that had contributed to crime and caused American students to fall behind their peers in other industrialized nations.</p>

        <p>Sounding his new slogan intended to raise anxieties about the nation's well-being, Gov. George W. Bush accused the Clinton administration today of helping create an ''education recession'' in which minority and low-income students were routinely allowed to fail.</p>
        <p>Seeking to draw a clear link between the nation's future economic health and the quality of its schools, Mr. Bush asserted that the nation faced a reading crisis that had contributed to crime and caused American students to fall behind their peers in other industrialized nations.</p>
        <p>''This is a leading indicator of troubles to come,'' Mr. Bush told 500 supporters early today at an elementary school in Beaverton, Ore., 10 miles west of Portland. ''Children who never master reading can never master learning. As uneducated adults, they face a life of struggle on the fringes of our society. Some will turn to crime and end up in prison.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, the Republican nominee for president, outlined his proposals to improve grade school reading programs, expand scholarship programs for math and science students and encourage annual testing of students in grades three through eight. He accused his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, of promising change but instead protecting a failed status quo.</p>
        <p>''They call for new spending without real reform or accountability,'' the Texas governor said. ''It's like pumping gas into a flooded engine.''</p>
        <p>Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, countered that Mr. Bush would not be able to afford his education proposals because he would need the entire federal surplus to pay for his military programs and tax cuts. Mr. Bush denies that.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's school event kicked off a three-day swing on the West Coast that today took him through Washington and Oregon, states where Democrats have carried recent presidential elections but where polls show Mr. Bush running neck-and-neck with Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>In both states, Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, has recently drawn enthusiastic crowds of more than 10,000 people and is considered a threat to draw disaffected Democrats away from Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Later today, Mr. Bush told several hundred supporters at an airport rally here that he would oppose breaching hydroelectric dams on the Snake River, as some environmentalists had proposed, to improve salmon habitats. He also attacked Mr. Gore for having said he wanted to study the issue further.</p>
        <p>''He's worried about some kind of group's not liking him,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He wants to study it as way of not taking a position.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also plans to spend two days in California, where polls show Mr. Gore holding a comfortable lead. Part of Mr. Bush's goal is to tap into the state's wealth: he plans to raise more than $1.4 million for the state Republican Party at Silicon Valley and Los Angeles fund-raisers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush's communications director, Karen P. Hughes, asserted that the governor also wanted to show that he planned to contest California until Election Day.</p>
        <p>''He wouldn't be going there, at a critical point in the campaign, if we didn't think we could compete in California,'' Ms. Hughes said.</p>
        <p>Coming about a week before what will probably be among the most important moments of the fall campaign -- a nationally televised debate with Mr. Gore -- today's event in Beaverton also gave Mr. Bush an opportunity to fine-tune his message on a signature issue before a friendly audience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not hold a news conference but instead fielded gently worded questions from the largely partisan audience. With each response, Mr. Bush expounded on his plans to cut taxes, increase military spending and improve education.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush has sought to lay blame for the nation's education problems squarely on the administration's doorstep, many educators contend that the federal government plays a relatively minor role in primary and secondary education. The most important decisions -- on curriculum, standards, testing, personnel and construction -- are made by state and local officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush himself acknowledged the limitations of federal action today, noting that Washington provides only 7 percent of public education spending.</p>
        <p>''It's not as if the federal government is going to solve 100 percent of the problems,'' he said. ''The best education is that where it's focused at the state and local government.''</p>
        <p>The focus of Mr. Bush's education plan is to ensure that all children read proficiently by the fourth grade. He would provide aid to help primary schools expand reading programs and reward schools that administered standardized tests annually to help educators identify learning problems early. For those and other proposals, Mr. Bush has called for increasing federal education spending by $47 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>Schools that failed to reduce the gap in test scores between low-income students and their more affluent peers in three years would lose some of their federal Title I funds, which are earmarked for low-income children. That money, $1,500 a student, would be given directly to parents of children in failing schools, who could use it for other educational purposes, like hiring tutors or paying private-school tuition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has called for increasing federal education spending by $115 billion over 10 years to help districts build new schools, provide preschool for most students, hire more teachers and raise teacher salaries.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Bush, he has proposed withholding federal aid from states where test scores do not improve. But unlike his opponent, he would redirect that money to the local schools with the greatest problems, rather than give it to parents.</p>
        <p>Toward the end of the education event in Beaverton, Mr. Bush was asked what could be done to help students reconnect with politics, and he recommended that candidates not make decisions based on polls or focus groups.</p>
        <p>But the Bush campaign is not completely averse to such tools; the phrase ''education recession'' was carefully poll-tested before Mr. Bush first deployed it today.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush was pitching his education ideas, his running mate, Dick Cheney, continued his attacks on Mr. Gore, accusing him of having a conflict of interest involving stock and oil prices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney told reporters in Springfield, Ohio, that Mr. Gore supported extending a moratorium on royalties paid by United States companies drilling for natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico. That position, Mr. Cheney said, would benefit Occidental Petroleum -- a company whose stock is held in a trust belonging to Mr. Gore's mother.</p>
        <p>''Gore continues to be the prospective beneficiary of holdings of stock in Occidental Petroleum in the family trust,'' Mr. Cheney said, ''and I think that that does constitute a conflict of interest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney said the vice president should either recuse himself from participating in decisions about energy policy or ask his mother to divest the family trust of oil stocks.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spell, the spokeswoman for Mr. Gore, said that the vice president neither owned nor controlled any stock in Occidental and that there was no way of knowing what stocks would be in the family trust when he inherited them.</p>
