      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A lawsuit filed by New York State's attorney general against General Electric last year arguing that the company should be held liable for the economic costs of pollution in the Hudson River has been dismissed by an Albany judge, who called it ''premature'' and ''meritless.''</p>
        <p>Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer refused to admit defeat, however, and said the lawsuit's central argument would be revived in another suit.</p>
        <p>The case marked what legal authorities said was a novel approach in the decades-long drama of the Hudson's contamination and the tortuous path to its cleanup.</p>
        <p>Instead of focusing on environmental or health damage from the polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, that General Electric factories discharged into the river during three decades, Mr. Spitzer asked the court to look at the harm to navigation, tourism and the economic life of the river.</p>
        <p>The suit contended that shipping and tourism traffic on the 35-mile-long Champlain Canal, which stretches from the southern tip of Lake Champlain to a point just down river from two General Electric factories, has become severely restricted because contaminated silt has built up in the river.</p>
        <p>The attorney general's office asked the judge to order that section of the river dredged, and to make the company pay for the damage to the local economy, because larger boats can no longer make the canal journey. The state has not dredged the silt that blocks the vessels' way because the need to prevent the PCB's from spreading would make it too costly, officials have said.</p>
        <p>In his decision, which he signed on Sept. 14 but apparently only issued to the parties yesterday, Justice Stephen A. Ferradino of State Supreme Court said, in effect, that the court was being asked to go into uncharted territory. Since the agencies with regulatory control over the dredging issue, especially the Environmental Protection Agency, have not rendered a decision on whether dredging is the best solution to the PCB problem, the judge said, the court could take no action on its own.</p>
        <p>General Electric has spent tens of millions of dollars asserting that the PCB's should be left entombed in the river bottom silt, and that dredging could repollute a river that the company officials say is cleansing itself. Justice Ferradino stressed that even if the company wanted to dredge the river, it could not legally do so now, nor could he order it to.</p>
        <p>''G.E. would be under court order to do what it could not do,'' he wrote. ''The court will not put the defendant in such an untenable position.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer said he believed an equally important element of the decision was the judge's ruling that the statute of limitations governing legal claims over the PCB pollution had not expired, as General Electric's  lawyers contended.</p>
        <p>The company's plants discharged into the river, legally and under state permit, about one million pounds of PCB's from the 1940's to the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists mostly agreed with Mr. Spitzer that the decision left room for future maneuvering.</p>
        <p>''The judge left the door open for the attorney general to come back at this issue once the E.P.A. has rendered its decision,'' said Cara Lee, the environmental director of Scenic Hudson, a private conservation group in Poughkeepsie.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for General Electric, Mark L. Behan, characterized the ruling as dismissing Mr. Spitzer's overall argument about the canal. The statute of limitations finding would do nothing to bolster any future lawsuits, Mr. Behan argued.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has said it will issue a final decision on a cleanup plan by the end of this year, and a spokesman for the agency, David Cohen, said Justice Ferradino's decision would have no effect on either the decision or the timetable.</p>
