        <p>MetroStars goalkeeper Mike Ammann has defied all odds. Just when everyone had figured he would be out for the season courtesy of Mamadou Diallo's left knee, Ammann is close to returning to action in the second round of the Major League Soccer playoffs.</p>
        <p>Ammann had a full practice with the MetroStars yesterday and said afterward that he would not play in tonight's opening game of their semifinal series in Chicago against the Fire.

        <p>MetroStars goalkeeper Mike Ammann has defied all odds. Just when everyone had figured he would be out for the season courtesy of Mamadou Diallo's left knee, Ammann is close to returning to action in the second round of the Major League Soccer playoffs.</p>
        <p>Ammann had a full practice with the MetroStars yesterday and said afterward that he would not play in tonight's opening game of their semifinal series in Chicago against the Fire. But he quickly pointed out that he could play on Saturday at Giants Stadium in the second game of the series.</p>
        <p>''Not enough practice to play tomorrow,'' Ammann said yesterday before the MetroStars left for Chicago. ''My timing is not there yet, but I think I'll be ready for Saturday.''</p>
        <p>Except for Daniel Hernandez, who is at home recovering from reconstructive surgery in his right knee, Coach Octavio Zambrano took all the MetroStars on the trip. While Ammann ruled out any chance of playing tonight, Zambrano left open the possibility that he might give Ammann a chance.</p>
        <p>''I would not rule him out at this point,'' said Zambrano, who admitted he would make few changes from the lineup that eliminated Dallas in two games. One change Zambrano might make is teaming Alex Comas with Clint Mathis as his twin strikers before he goes to Adolfo Valencia.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars and the Fire split two games in the regular season, each team winning at home, but Chicago has been playing well lately. With the former Bulgarian international Hristo Stoitchkov leading the way, the Fire eliminated New England with a 6-0 trouncing in the third game of that series Friday night in Chicago.</p>
        <p>CHAMPIONS LEAGUE</p>
        <p>Europe's most prestigious competition for clubs is set to generate more money this season than the $491.9 million it earned last season for clubs, leagues and officials, Europe's governing body, UEFA, announced yesterday in Geneva. UEFA said in a statement that while it could not predict the final figures, the budgeted income for the season will be higher than last year's revenue.</p>
        <p>The clubs take 75 percent of revenue, including a 5 percent slice that goes to their domestic leagues. The remaining 25 percent goes to UEFA, which keeps some for itself and uses the rest for solidarity payments to leagues, clubs and its 51 associations.</p>
        <p>This is the third week of competition this season with a full schedule. Barcelona and AC Milan will meet today at the Nou Camp in Spain in a match that has taken added significance following shocking defeats for the two powerhouses last week. Barcelona's 3-0 loss at the hands of Besiktas, in Turkey, raised alarm bells after some awful defending, while AC Milan suffered a 1-0 loss to Leeds United on a freakish goal.</p>
        <p>Real Madrid will be full of confidence after an impressive 4-1 victory against Athletic Bilbao in league play, but today's match at Bayer Leverkusen of Germany will also be different after Leverkusen's 3-2 victory over Sporting Lisbon last week. Sporting has only 1 point from two games and needs a victory in its visit to Moscow to play Spartak.</p>
        <p>One of the best matches of the week will be the clash between Lazio of Italy and Arsenal of England in north London. Arsenal has been playing well, but Lazio's glittering array of talent will prove a tough test as Lazio is a joint favorite with Manchester United.</p>
        <p>Juventus, the most famous of Italian clubs, faces a tricky opponent today in the Spanish champion, Deportivo Coruna, a winner over Hamburg SV last week.</p>
        <p>Manchester United and Bayern Munich started well, with the Germans comfortably winning their first two matches in Group F, while United strolled past Anderlecht of Belgium in the first game but settled for a scoreless tie last week in Kiev, Ukraine.</p>
        <p>The Glasgow Rangers will travel to Turkey to meet Galatasaray, which was embarrassed last week by Austria's Sturm Graz.</p>
        <p>GERMANY</p>
        <p>Manager Uli Hoeness of Bayern Munich, the German champions, said yesterday that his club was willing to spend anywhere between $9 million and $13 million for a defender and that he was determined to buy one before the winter break in the Bundesliga. The German champions were said to be talking last week with the Croatian international Igor Biscan, 22, who plays for Dinamo Zagreb. Biscan is also being pursued by Barcelona, Ajax and Fenerbahce of Turkey.</p>
        <p>Bayer Leverkusen Coach Christoph Daum warned yesterday that he might not take the job as coach of the national team as expected. Chosen by the German federation in July, Daum is supposed to replace the stand-in coach, Rudi Voller, in eight months.</p>
        <p>With Voller having success in the 2002 World Cup qualifying, Daum is having second thoughts after Leverkusen got off to a shaky start in the Bundesliga. Daum said he would decide in two weeks.</p>
