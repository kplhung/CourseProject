        <p>The conclusion of the Spring 2001 collections in New York brought with it these questions: Is there time between now and March for stores to figure out how to control the masses of women, many possibly wearing side ponytails and scrunchies, who will storm the gates demanding to look as they did the first time they heard a Human League song? Will Barneys and Bergdorf's start to resemble the meat counter at Balducci's, with numbers handed out for handkerchief skirts rather than pork chops?</p>
        <p>It isn't that the clothes shown last week, with their drapey off-the-shoulder necklines, wide shirred sleeves and crushed waistlines, are unwearable. It is just that the era they allude to, a sanitized version of the New Wave 1980's, isn't one that seems all that relevant in a period when money is still the drug favored over anything available in a powder. When designers mined the 80's of Aaron Spelling last season, they seemed in touch, at least, with a materialistic world glued to the television taking in ''Sex and the City,'' and a new generation of women aiming to sleep their way into residences of greater square footage.</p>

        <p>The conclusion of the Spring 2001 collections in New York brought with it these questions: Is there time between now and March for stores to figure out how to control the masses of women, many possibly wearing side ponytails and scrunchies, who will storm the gates demanding to look as they did the first time they heard a Human League song? Will Barneys and Bergdorf's start to resemble the meat counter at Balducci's, with numbers handed out for handkerchief skirts rather than pork chops?</p>
        <p>It isn't that the clothes shown last week, with their drapey off-the-shoulder necklines, wide shirred sleeves and crushed waistlines, are unwearable. It is just that the era they allude to, a sanitized version of the New Wave 1980's, isn't one that seems all that relevant in a period when money is still the drug favored over anything available in a powder. When designers mined the 80's of Aaron Spelling last season, they seemed in touch, at least, with a materialistic world glued to the television taking in ''Sex and the City,'' and a new generation of women aiming to sleep their way into residences of greater square footage.</p>
        <p>To look at the editors and other women seated at fashion shows, to watch them frantically working Palm Pilots in one hand and cell phones in the other, provides evidence enough that this isn't a live-and-let-live moment. Is Brooke de Ocampo, say, really going to trade in the tweed suit she wore last week from Marc Jacobs's fall collection for one of his new, faux Debbie Harry looks come Easter?</p>
        <p>The lure of the early 80's was too forceful even for Donna Karan to resist. In the actual early 80's, Ms. Karan was making bodysuits and other utilitarian garments for working women. Her collection shown on Friday afternoon showcased a line that was loose and asymmetrical and apparently meant for the woman who said goodbye to the 70-hour work week at Morgan Stanley, opting for a life requiring chiffon and droopy sleeves. Some dresses tied obtrusively just below the waist or on the hip. Hemlines seemed to fall in layers of poufy triangles. There were a number of beautiful pieces, a striped organza trench coat with matching skirt, for example, but for the most part Ms. Karan's collection concentrated too heavily  on clothes for after dark.</p>
        <p>The collection for Ms. Karan's DKNY line moved speedily, but it was hard to know what she wanted to convey other than a belief that men and women should wear tinted visors and low-slung belts.</p>
        <p>Calvin Klein, who showed his collection Friday evening, also dipped into the early 80's but with considerably more restraint than some others. The concession to the prevailing mood could be as simple as a bit of elasticized gathering in the lower back portion of a jacket. Mr. Klein put dolman sleeves on a taffeta jacket, or an exaggerated cowl on a dress, but never let such references overpower his own assured voice. He showed more color than he has in past seasons, as well as a looser silhouette; the result was a collection that felt less monotonous, more awake than in previous seasons. And there were clothes for the gamut of life's demands, from simple jersey dresses for work to iridescent satins for evening.</p>
        <p>Like Nicolas Ghesquiere, who showed his line for Callaghan on Friday morning, Nicole Noselli and Daphne Gutierrez have been steeped in the 80's all along. The two women, who design the line Bruce, arrived on the fashion scene a few seasons ago ordained as ones to watch. They do not occupy quite the pinnacle of hipness as, say, Imitation of Christ, whose show managed to drag editors away from their beach houses a week ago Sunday. As talented as the Bruce designers are, many senior editors did not feel compelled to travel to the Hunter College Rotunda on the F.D.R. Drive on Friday night, a fact lamented by Polly Mellen, the former Conde Nast editor. ''At my level, you won't see many editors at something like this, and that I don't approve of,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In the past, Ms. Noselli and Ms. Gutierrez have opted for presentations; this time they staged a show, which perhaps because they think the world expects such things of the young avant-garde, started one hour and 15 minutes late. The show contained only about 14 looks, but as a result was one of the most focused collections of the week.</p>
        <p>Their universe is a cold one, despite fringe belts and sleeves roomy enough to hide tambourines. Their palette was restricted to khakis and mustards. Although they, too, are referencing the 80's, Ms. Noselli and Ms. Gutierrez, unlike many designers, don't seem to want merely to capitalize on nostalgia. There isn't the sense that they're rummaging through the 80's. Instead, they seem challenged by how inventively they can play with the decade's motifs. With an asymmetrically cut skirt, they paired a sweater with a contrasting dolman sleeve on one arm and no sleeve on the other. A pair of wide-leg cropped pants had one leg pleated and one leg played straight.</p>
        <p>It was Wynn Smith's misfortune to land Fashion Week's last time slot -- Friday at 8 p.m., which became Friday at 9:30 thanks to  Bruce's late start -- for the showing of his Wink collection. Ms. Mellen was again one of the few well-known fashion faces in the crowd. That was a pity. In a loft on lower Broadway, Mr. Smith's models stood their ground, with guests looping around a kind of runway. The designer played with the stark aesthetic of the Amish, showing, for example, a black dress with a diamond applique  of quilting.</p>
        <p>The clothes had a somber, deranged beauty. Mr. Smith, who used to produce exquisitely made-to-order suits and dresses, felt free to let his skill with a scissors out of the closet. A number of simple cotton dresses revealed backs of elaborate crisscrossing. Next season, one hopes, he will be able to show when the fashion world isn't too tired to show up.</p>
