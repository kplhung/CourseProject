        <p>Going Against Summer Traffic</p>
        <p>There are those who flee Manhattan in the summer, and then there is LINDY HESS, who plans to spend summers in Manhattan from now on.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hess is the director of the Radcliffe Publishing Course, a six-week summer program that is moving to Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. Among the alumni of the 53-year-old program are VICTOR S. NAVASKY, the publisher and editorial director of The Nation; DOMINIQUE BROWNING, the editor in chief of House and Garden; and DAVID GRANGER, the editor in chief of Esquire.</p>
        <p>''I've been trying for years to persuade the New York publishing industry to move to Cambridge,'' Ms. Hess said yesterday. ''Having failed to do that, I think this is a wonderful oportunity to move the course to New York, where I think it should be anyway.'' But some things will not change: the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard (the official name since Radcliffe College merged with Harvard last year) and Columbia said that the publishing course would keep the Radcliffe name for the next two years.</p>
        <p>Invited, But Where?</p>
        <p>The interior designer JOHN CHRISTENSEN invited some friends to a party for JULIE BROWN, the former MTV V.J., at his apartment on Saturday night. The problem was that someone (not Mr. Christensen) gave Ms. Brown the wrong address.</p>
        <p>About 10 p.m., her friend MONTGOMERY FRAZIER, who was at Mr. Christensen's, dialed Ms. Brown's cell phone number to see if she remembered, as he put it, ''this party at which she is supposed to be the guest of honor.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown had not forgotten. ''I had given up ringing a doorbell at the wrong house,'' she said, and had headed off to a restaurant with four friends who had also expected to be at the party. A fifth person was supposed to join them, and she had given him the wrong address, too. So she left a note in the vestibule at the wrong address: ''Stanley, Oops. Call me.''</p>
        <p>Eventually STANLEY ZAREFF joined the group at dinner, and later at Mr. Christensen's, where Ms. Brown showed off her engagement ring. She said she planned to marry MARTIN SHERMAN, a German businessman, next April.</p>
        <p>A Belated Host</p>
        <p>The opposite problem occurred at the Landmark Restaurant on East 58th Street. Its owner, SHAMSHER WADUD, gave a birthday party for a friend from Andrew Ward High School in Fairfield, Conn.: the actor RICHARD BELZER, who plays a detective on ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.''</p>
        <p>In this case, the guest of honor was on time, but the host arrived nearly three hours after the party began. Just busy at his other restaurant, Nirvana, on Central Park South, he said, when he finally greeted Mr. Belzer.</p>
        <p>The crowd included PAUL SHAFFER, DICK CAVETT and MARISKA HARGITAY, who also plays a detective on ''Special Victims Unit'' and whose hair was shorter and spikier than it was last season. ''I looked at myself one morning and thought I didn't want to be bogged down,'' she said. Because the season premiere has not been broadcast yet, she added, ''Nobody recognizes me. It's wonderful.''</p>
        <p>TD's With CD's</p>
        <p>JOE NAMATH, who spent time in the 1980's working as a commentator on ''Monday Night Football,'' has advice for fans who find themselves diving for a dictionary or an encyclopedia to understand DENNIS MILLER'S occasionally obscure references.</p>
        <p>''I put the game on, turn the sound down, and then I put on my favorite jazz music,'' Mr. Namath said. ''I don't listen to the announcers.'' (He said he had nothing against Mr. Miller: ''Personally, I like him.'')</p>
        <p>At a party for the ESPN Classic cable channel over the weekend, the sportscaster DICK SCHAAP reminded Mr. Namath of a story about the commentator who once seemed to personify ''Monday Night Football.''</p>
        <p>''I was writing a book with Joe in 1969,'' Mr. Schaap said, ''and one night we were in his apartment with Howard Cosell. Joe's roommate was Ray Abbruzzese, a Jets player, who was sleeping in his bedroom at the time. Cosell was talking, and he woke Ray up. Ray walked out of the bedroom, walked over to the TV set and pushed the off button. But he still heard Howard's voice. 'What are you doing here?' Abbruzzese said, looking at Cosell. 'I just turned you off!' ''</p>
