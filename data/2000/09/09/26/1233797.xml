        <p>The compact Blaine Wilson launched into his first vault, tumbled through the air with his body tucked as tight as a lollipop swirl only to backpedal badly through his landing.</p>
        <p>On his second vault, there was no mishap, but the difficulty level of the routine was so low, he had no way to win a medal in the Olympic apparatus finals today at the Super Dome. Just after Wilson's sixth-place finish, Elise Ray bobbled her way to the bottom of the standings in the balance beam finals.</p>
        <p>At that point, hope plunged, fizzled and died -- an Alka Seltzer-like ending to the American's upsetting week. For the first time since 1972 -- not including the 1980 boycott year -- the United States failed to win a gymnastics medal at the Olympics. Once again, as part of a trend this last week, there was plenty of blame but no accountability for the disappointment. Today, a conspiracy theory was added to the mix of excuses.</p>
        <p>''When you're judged on how you look and not by what you do, you're not going to get the score,'' Wilson said. ''The judges don't like Americans, I think. Some do; some don't. It's all subjective.''</p>
        <p>More than the judges, the pressure seemed to get to the Americans. The leaders of the men's and women's teams had particular trouble coping. Instead of leading the men to a reachable bronze team medal, Wilson buckled during the competition and the men's team finished fifth. Instead of redemption, he found disappointment in the all-around meet, then again in the apparatus finals.</p>
        <p>''I'm tired of explaining that winning a medal doesn't make you a person,'' Wilson said. ''I'm a two-time Olympian.''</p>
        <p>This was Ray's first time. She had her hiccups in her effort to lead the women to the medal stand (they were fourth in the team competition), but also had to endure the cruel twist of a mismeasured vault in the all-around competition. Today, she felt all eyes on her as America's last chance. ''The Olympics has not been everything I had hoped the whole experience would be,'' Ray said. ''A lot of things I didn't think would happen did happen.''</p>
        <p>What did happen today resulted in two more medals for Aleksei Nemov of Russia, who edged Benjamin Varonian of France for the gold on the horizontal bar and took a bronze on the parallel bars; his six medals here equaled his count in Atlanta four years ago. Russia's Svetlana Khorkina added a silver from the floor exercise to the gold she won in the uneven bars on Sunday. Her teammate, Yelena Zamolodtchikova, won gold on the floor. Gervasio Deferr of Spain won the gold in the vault; Li Xiaopeng of China won gold on the parallel bars; and Liu Xuan won China's first gold on the balance beam.</p>
        <p>The United States, meanwhile, was left to examine a system that seems to have failed. There is no united training program for the men. And the women's team is in disarray. Four years after a gold medal in Atlanta, Bela Karolyi's last-minute insertion into the revival plan left the team divided. Once the women came up short of a team bronze, a flurry of backbiting and finger-pointing flowed from coaches and athletes.</p>
        <p>Did the USA Gymnastics president, Bob Colarossi, give Karolyi too little control or too much when he asked the Svengali to save the program? Did Coach Kelli Hill's conservative approach on the floor leave the team flat? Were there too many coaches, too many separate agendas? Everyone voiced his and her criticism.</p>
        <p>''I think there was too much of that, both in the arena and in the gym, between coaches and the gymnasts,'' Ray said of the bickering. ''I think it took our focus away. But it's our job to keep our focus.''</p>
        <p>In her response, the 18-year-old Ray was more adult than most of her sniping elders this last week. But when asked how disturbing the discord was to him, Colarossi professed ignorance. He said he had paid no attention to the accounts of dysfunction emanating from the team.</p>
        <p>''We put the program in place,'' said Colarossi, who tugged Karolyi out of retirement to be the national coordinator after the women's team finished sixth in the 1999 World Championships. ''We went up two spots, so it worked.''</p>
        <p>Outside of Colarossi, there were few signs of satisfaction. As she left, Hill expressed her distaste for the blueprint devised when Karolyi entered and began a series of camps that led up to the Olympics.</p>
        <p>''Do I think we moved from sixth to fourth because of the camps? No,'' Hill said. ''Bela has a huge amount of knowledge, and he's a great motivator, but you can't take kids coached by individual coaches and turn them over to him for the last six weeks.</p>
        <p>''We have to get on the same page. I don't have any idea how.''</p>
        <p>There is uncertainty about the future of USA Gymnastics. Unlike the factory systems that still pop out champions in Romania, China and Russia, American gymnasts still like to attend their proms. That has been the issue for years. In the end, there seems to be no good excuse for the 28-year low the program has found itself in.</p>
        <p>''It's disappointing,'' Ray said. ''At the same time, I don't think anyone has ever had to go through what we did this year. So it's a totally different ballgame. I don't know what will happen in the future.''</p>
        <p>DISMOUNTS</p>
        <p>JOHN DANTZSCHER, father of the American gymnast JAMIE DANTZSCHER, remained in stable but critical condition in a local hospital after an auto accident on Friday in downtown Sydney. He was riding in a taxi when it collided with a bus, leaving him with head trauma.</p>
