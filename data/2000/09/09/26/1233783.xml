      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Back in the 1960's Rudy Ray Moore was content to sing jovial rhythm-and-blues. He recorded songs about finding and losing love; he declared that women were ''Angels on Earth'' and called himself a ''Hully Gully Papa'' who loved to ''coffee grind real slow.'' He sang those songs again, for what was said to be the first time in more than 30 years, at Wetlands on Saturday night, celebrating their recent rerelease on ''Hully Gully Fever'' (Norton).</p>
        <p>But a gift for uninhibited raunchiness and braggadocio gave him a far more celebrated career. On party records he made in the 1970's, Mr. Moore rhymed about sex and other exploits while his band played blues or jazz vamps. Joining a tall-tale tradition that also includes Bo Diddley, Mr. Moore adopted ''bad'' personas with names like Dolemite or Petey Wheatstraw (''the devil's son-in-law''); by the end of the 1970's, Dolemite had been in his own series of blaxploitation movies. Since then rappers have traded blues for funk, tightened up the rhyme cadences and taken party-record raunch to the national pop charts, while sampling Mr. Moore and sometimes (like Big Daddy Kane) collaborating with him. A movie comeback, ''Dolemite 2001,'' is scheduled next year.</p>

        <p>But a gift for uninhibited raunchiness and braggadocio gave him a far more celebrated career. On party records he made in the 1970's, Mr. Moore rhymed about sex and other exploits while his band played blues or jazz vamps. Joining a tall-tale tradition that also includes Bo Diddley, Mr. Moore adopted ''bad'' personas with names like Dolemite or Petey Wheatstraw (''the devil's son-in-law''); by the end of the 1970's, Dolemite had been in his own series of blaxploitation movies.

A movie comeback, ''Dolemite 2001,'' is scheduled next year.</p>
        <p>In two late-night sets at Wetlands, Mr. Moore veered between what he called G-rated and X-rated material. He still has his voice, a gruffly forthright baritone that's at home anywhere along the continuum from preacherly declamation to blues lines. A band led by Jimmy Lynch, including four male backup singers harmonizing in falsetto, harked back to jump-blues, 1950's rock and New Orleans rhythm-and-blues.</p>
        <p>When he sang, Mr. Moore was Mr. Nice Guy, pitching woo or struggling with heartbreak in standard blues modes. But the ''bad'' side was more original. When he rhymed or told hoary jokes, he wisecracked his way through a world of uncontrollable lusts and endless battles: men challenging men for dominance, and women demanding that men perform. Behind the crudeness and the wildly hyperbolic fights and trysts was an underlying generosity that hip-hop didn't retain. He wanted everyone to have satisfaction and to get a good laugh when they couldn't.</p>
