        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Stanley Herz (Op-Ed, Sept. 21) complains about paying taxes on his mother-in-law's estate, but she didn't need ''a coterie of tax lawyers'' to make plans to shield her estate from tax.</p>
        <p>Almost everyone (like my own 83-year-old mother) whose assets are in the estate tax ballpark already deals with a tax preparer and a will-writing lawyer, at the least. These professionals inform their aging clients of pre-decease gifts, education funds for grandchildren and other simple strategies for reducing estates.</p>
        <p>Given these opportunities, which require nothing of the donor beyond a little form-filling and check-writing, and considering that the exemption from estate taxes is scheduled to rise from the current $675,000 to $1 million by 2006, few baby boomers whose parents have saved well need worry about estate tax -- unless they are greedy for even more of this money that they didn't earn.</p>
