        <p>As opera lovers arrived at Lincoln Center for last night's opening, they were greeted by hundreds of cacophonous demonstrators backing an effort to unionize 95 restaurant workers at the Metropolitan Opera House.</p>
        <p>The demonstration, one year after a nearly identical protest at last September's Met opening, shows that the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union has made little headway in its unionization drive.</p>
        <p>Last night, as was the case last September, union supporters said it was unfair that restaurant workers at the Met earned wages that kept them in poverty while they catered to rich and superrich operagoers.</p>
        <p>Henry Tamarin, the president of Local 100 of the restaurant workers' union, said yesterday about last night's opera benefit: ''Nowhere else in New York will the disparity between the working poor and the upper crust be so clear as tonight when 3,800 members of the power elite in black tie and elegant gowns pay up to $2,250 to attend. ''One ticket costs more than some of these workers take home in two months.''</p>
        <p>Irked by the demonstrations and leafleting, Met officials have sought to wash their hands of the affair, saying it is a matter between the union and the Met's food-services contractor, Restaurant Associates, not between the union and the Met.</p>
        <p>For months, the union's strategy was to maximize pressure on the Met to get opera officials to push Restaurant Associates to grant union recognition. Sometimes union backers have embarrassed Met board members at their workplace.</p>
        <p>But the Metropolitan Opera has hurt this strategy by obtaining a federal court injunction that orders the union not to take any steps that drag the Met into a dispute that a federal judge said involves Restaurant Associates, not the opera.</p>
        <p>''This dispute is between Restaurant Associates and the union, and the Metropolitan Opera is not permitted to have any role in it,'' said Sharon E. Grubin, the Met's general counsel. ''I would hope the union finally makes that clear.''</p>
        <p>Michael Anderson, a lawyer for the union, said the injunction was an unconstitutional prior restraint against free speech. Last week he urged the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York to overturn the injunction.</p>
        <p>At last night's demonstration, the union circulated leaflets saying: ''The Metropolitan Opera has obtained an injunction that prohibits us from saying that the Metropolitan Opera is involved in a labor dispute, saying 'shame on you' or making any other attribution of blame to the Metropolitan Opera.''</p>
        <p>They added, '' If you find yourself having any of these thoughts, please do not express them.''</p>
        <p>The restaurant workers' union is demanding that Restaurant Associates grant union recognition to the Met's food workers once a majority of them sign cards expressing their desire to join a union. Union officials say such card checks are a faster, less expensive, less antagonistic way to determine sentiment than the traditional union election.</p>
        <p>But Larry Jones, general counsel for Restaurant Associates, said his company would not accept the union's demand for recognition through a card check. ''It's our policy that we let our employees choose through an independent democratic voting process whether or not they want union representation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones said the Met's food workers enjoyed very competitive wages and benefits and an excellent work environment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tamarin, the union president, voiced frustration that the pressure campaign had not succeeded in persuading Restaurant Associates to recognize the union through a card check. He said that last year 76 of the 95 workers signed cards saying they wanted to join his local.</p>
        <p>He noted that a yearlong pressure campaign against Salomon Smith Barney had helped get the firm's food contractor, Aramark, to grant union recognition to 56 restaurant workers at the bank's Manhattan headquarters in May 1998.</p>
        <p>''Restaurant Associates is being particularly intransigent,'' Mr. Tamarin said. ''Unfortunately a year-long campaign in an organizing drive is not uncommon. This is something we have to do a better job at as a union and as a movement.''</p>
        <p>Some union leaders suggested that the city's labor movement had not done enough to pressure the Met to do what it could to settle the dispute.</p>
        <p>Josh Freeman, a professor of labor history at Queens College, said: ''If the person contracting with another firm is willing to stand tough as the Metropolitan Opera is, it's very hard to find a point of leverage. Similar tactics have been successful for Local 100 with Wall Street brokerage firms. Local 100 has been pretty shrewd in this approach, but it's not a magic bullet.''</p>
