        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>CHENEY SURVEYS STORM DAMAGE -- Dick Cheney's voting record in Congress followed him to Ohio yesterday as he stopped to survey the damage from a storm on Wednesday in Xenia. Mr. Cheney stood beside Gov. Robert Taft of Ohio as he called on President Clinton to declare Xenia a federal disaster area.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign was quick to note that when Mr. Cheney served as Wyoming's lone congressman, he voted several times against financing for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which provides relief to disaster sites like Xenia.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>CHENEY SURVEYS STORM DAMAGE -- Dick Cheney's voting record in Congress followed him to Ohio yesterday as he stopped to survey the damage from a storm on Wednesday in Xenia. Mr. Cheney stood beside Gov. Robert Taft of Ohio as he called on President Clinton to declare Xenia a federal disaster area.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign was quick to note that when Mr. Cheney served as Wyoming's lone congressman, he voted several times against financing for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which provides relief to disaster sites like Xenia.</p>
        <p>Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman for the Cheney campaign, said Mr. Cheney voted against some of the bills because they were part of larger bills that he had other objections to, some because they were not given adequate debate, some because they were not supported by the Reagan administration and others because he thought they were simply too expensive.</p>

        <p>THE DEBATES</p>
        <p>FOX TO SKIP DEBATE -- The Fox television network has cast its vote in the presidential election -- in favor of ''Dark Angel.'' When CBS and ABC broadcast the first debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush on Oct. 3, Fox will be screening the two-hour premiere of a science-fiction adventure series. NBC, for its part, said last week it had to stick to baseball.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>GIFTS FROM MOM -- Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's 85-year-old mother, Marcia, is sending care packages, not only to her son, but to reporters following him. The brown paper-wrapped boxes were mailed from her Stamford, Conn., home and recently delivered to reporters aboard his plane in Texas. So what did she send? Tylenol, lip balm, tissues, an apple, Manishewitz bagel chips, a news clipping about her son, candies, a pair of plastic sunglasses, postcards for reporters to write home to their own mothers -- and a handwritten note that implores reporters to ''Please be good to my son!'' It was signed, ''Marcia Lieberman (Joe's mom!).''</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>THE MEDIA</p>
        <p>SUBLIMINAL REACTION -- The cover of The New Republic, dated Oct. 2, looks a lot like any other cover of the weekly political magazine. But careful readers might notice something different. In the solid red bar that appears on the cover of every issue are the barely visible words ''Don't Trust Arafat.''</p>
        <p>What gives with the subliminal sloganeering? Peter Beinart, the editor, said he ran the hidden headline, which does not refer to an article inside the magazine, as ''a response to the media obsession with subliminal advertising'' -- the brouhaha that erupted after the barely visible word ''rats'' flashed in an advertisement for Gov. George W. Bush intentionally or otherwise.</p>
        <p>''If everyone was suddenly venting their deepest darkest obsession in subliminal ways,'' Mr. Beinart went on, ''why not us? It's a humorous caricature of our position,'' he said.</p>

        <p>THE TRAVEL LOG -- After a weekend of debating oil prices and whether any ''moles'' were out there trying to pilfer campaign secrets, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore took to the stump again Monday, with Mr. Gore heading south to Florida, a state once considered Bush territory but now a crucial battleground, and Mr. Bush heading northwest for Oregon and Washington, states that once seemed safe Gore territory but, now, maybe not so safe.</p>
        <p>Length of the Official Day: Gore, 15 1/2 hours; Bush, 12 hours  States Visited: Gore, 1; Bush, 2  Towns and Cities Visited: Gore, 2 ; Bush, 2  Events: Gore, 3; Bush, 2  News Conferences/Interviews: Gore, 9; Bush 5 (includes editorial board meeting at The Oregonian newspaper)  Diners Visited/Unscheduled Drop-bys: Gore, 0; Bush 0  Main message: Gore, strengthening medicare; Bush improving education, renewing the promise of America's public schools.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 27, 2000, Wednesday  A report in the Campaign Briefing column yesterday about gift packages sent to reporters by Marcia Lieberman, the mother of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, misspelled the brand of bagel chips she included. It is Manischewitz, not Manishewitz.</p>
