        <p>The opposition candidate in the Yugoslav presidential election claimed victory today over Slobodan Milosevic in elections on Sunday. But with official vote counting suspended, there were concerns about whether Mr. Milosevic is willing to acknowledge defeat.</p>
        <p>Supporters of Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition candidate, said that according to their tally of more than 65 percent of the vote, he was ahead of Mr. Milosevic by 55 to 34 percent, or well on his way to a clear first-round victory.</p>
        <p>''According to our count, a first-round victory is certain,'' Mr. Kostunica declared. ''Dawn is coming to Serbia.''</p>
        <p>Even if the opposition's assertion of a first-round victory is not accepted, Milosevic allies fear that the elections could mark the beginning of the end of his 13-year rule. Tonight more than 20,000 people gathered in central Belgrade for a concert and rally to celebrate the victory hopes of Mr. Kostunica (pronounced kosh-TOON-eet-zah).</p>
        <p>But Mr. Milosevic's government today said, in effect, not so fast. After a long night and day of debate within the ruling coalition headed by Mr. Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic, together with the heads of the police and the army, the decision seemed to be to buy time. No official results were released, and indications were that they could come as late as Thursday, the legal deadline.</p>
        <p>By the ruling coalition's count, based on some 37 percent of the vote, Mr. Milosevic leads the race, 45 percent to 40 percent. A Socialist Party official, Gorica Gajevic, said those results show ''the probability that our candidate Slobodan Milosevic will win in the first round.''</p>
        <p>But an effort to tough out a declaration of a first-round win would be difficult for the party, given the apparent size of Mr. Milosevic's defeat -- but he and Ms. Markovic may decide to try.</p>
        <p>''The defeat is too obvious to be denied,'' said one former official of the party. ''They didn't expect such poor results. Even a small defeat is a problem for Milosevic. Now it's hard for him to find a way out without creating a crisis inside the system.''</p>
        <p>The United States and its Western allies, who have made ousting Mr. Milosevic a priority and who made war against Yugoslavia last year over Kosovo, urged Mr. Milosevic to accept defeat. While they originally cast doubt on the freedom and fairness of the elections, Western officials are now hailing them as a marvelous demonstration of the popular will.</p>
        <p>Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said today that if Mr. Milosevic accepts defeat and democratic change takes place, Washington would take steps to lift sanctions against Serbia.</p>
        <p>Last week Mr. Milosevic's federal prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, said Mr. Milosevic's mandate as president runs through its original term of July 2001, regardless of the outcome of the elections. The Constitution is unclear on the point, but other laws indicate that his mandate should end within 10 days of losing the election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, a 56-year-old constitutional lawyer, is a moderate nationalist, deeply critical of the NATO bombing war over Yugoslavia. He has criticized its legal justification, and called the bombing of civilian targets possible war crimes. He also  says he will not hand over Mr. Milosevic to the international criminal tribunal in The Hague.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica describes himself as a Western-oriented liberal democrat and once translated The Federalist Papers into Serbian.</p>
        <p>Ljubisa Ristic, president of Mrs. Markovic's party, the Yugoslav United Left, suggested that if there was a runoff, the government would accept ''the will of the people.''</p>
        <p>A second round, judging by the first, would mean a crushing defeat for Mr. Milosevic, and some in his party were said to have argued against the tactic, urging recognition of the defeat. Milosevic officials say they won control of the federal Parliament largely because the government of the sister republic, Montenegro, decided to boycott the election.</p>
        <p>A number of officials, especially in Ms. Markovic's party, reportedly argued that any concession could mean the rapid disintegration of Mr. Milosevic's control over Serbia, and they urged delay, a second round or even the rerunning of the elections.</p>
        <p>But opposition leaders said today that if their final tally still indicates that they won a first-round victory, they will demand it, even if the Federal Election Commission disagrees and calls for a second round.</p>
        <p>Opposition leaders said the commission, which must verify the vote totals reached at local polling stations, had stopped its work early Monday morning and had not resumed counting, a delay the opposition regarded as suspicious and another effort by the government to buy time.</p>
        <p>Each party has representatives at the polls who are informed of those counts, but the electoral commission in Belgrade has not announced vote totals. The commission contains two representatives from each political coalition, but a majority of its 28 members are appointed by the government. Its task is formally technical, to total local polling results and rule on any disparities.</p>
        <p>The opposition intends to call a rally in Belgrade and other towns across Serbia for Wednesday night to demonstrate for recognition of its victory, an opposition leader said.</p>
        <p>''If the Socialists declare victory or say we go to a second round, and it goes against the voting data we gather, we must defend our vote,'' said Zarko Korac. ''Why should we accept his offer for a second round, if it's illegal? Our problems are in a way beginning. We have to get him to concede his defeat.''</p>
        <p>While the opposition and Mr. Kostunica appear to have little taste for street revolution, many experts believe that the size of Mr. Milosevic's apparent defeat will quickly become known, despite his control over the state media, and that even the police will be reluctant to beat or shoot demonstrators now. While the police broke up rallies against him after his defeat in Kosovo, Mr. Milosevic was still widely accepted as the legitimate and legal president of Yugoslavia. Now matters are not quite so clear.</p>
        <p>''The numbers speak for us,'' Mr. Kostunica said today. ''We will fight in democratic ways. The truth is our strongest weapon. We don't want to provoke internal tensions and foreign intervention.''</p>
        <p>The opposition also did extremely well in municipalities, sweeping Belgrade and other large cities despite a split with the Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic, which suffered enormous defeats along with the Radical Party of the ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj. Mr. Draskovic admitted today that he had been wrong to run a campaign separate from Mr. Kostunica. Both Mr. Draskovic and Mr. Seselj offered to resign -- offers their parties are unlikely to accept.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica's insistence on unity at both federal and local levels proved to have been wise in the landslide of anti-government voting.</p>
        <p>While the pro-Western president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, succeeded in protecting his base by boycotting the federal election, the boycott handed Mr. Milosevic control of both houses of the federal Parliament, which he could not have won otherwise.</p>
        <p>Even if he takes office, Mr. Kostunica -- already contemplating choices for the Yugoslav prime minister -- does not have a large amount of formal powers. Mr. Milosevic really runs the country from his position at the apex of the Socialist Party and its web of politicians and businessmen. But if Mr. Milosevic is beaten, his own party will have to look beyond him and Mr. Kostunica will be a major voice and symbol of democratic change.</p>
