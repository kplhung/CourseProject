        <p>He finished second to Haile Gebrselassie in the last Summer Olympics; finished second again in the 1997 world championships and the 1999 world championships. But this major race felt different to Paul Tergat of Kenya as he sprinted into the lead with the finish line in sight.</p>
        <p>Hadn't Gebrselassie, the diminutive Ethiopian with the wicked kick, been moving more slowly of late? Hadn't his leg been bothering him all year? Hadn't all the victories and the miles on hard tracks built for sprinters left Tergat's rival slightly less hungry, slightly less fresh?</p>
        <p>Couldn't this finally be his moment, his 10,000 meters, his gold medal?</p>
        <p>Tergat pushed on: his long, thin legs and arms working confidently. But what he could not see as he broke free of the Ethiopian was how quickly Gebrselassie responded to the affront.</p>
        <p>''I was surprised when Tergat started sprinting before I did,'' Gebrselassie said. ''But I knew I could do something in the last few hundred meters.''</p>
        <p>Off the two rivals went: through the final turn with Gebrselassie making up ground slowly but making it up nonetheless. Down the final straightaway with both men's teeth flashing through the pain: down to the final 10 meters, and then Gebrselassie lunged past Tergat at the tape in a finish that bore a much greater resemblance to the split-second conclusion of a 100-meter race than to the end of a 10,000 meters.</p>
        <p>The closest and finest race in Olympic history in this event was over, and Tergat was still only the second best long-distance track runner of his generation. Gebrselassie had won his second Olympic gold medal in a time of 27 minutes 18.20 seconds. Tergat had won his second silver in 27:18.29. (You have to look back to 1932 to find a closer finish in an Olympic distance race; in the 5,000 meters that year, Lauri Lehtinen of Finland and Ralph Hill of the United States finished in a virtual dead heat.)</p>
        <p>''I never competed in a race with a finish like this, except maybe in a distance like 1,500,'' Gebrselassie said.</p>
        <p>''I was never sure I had it won,'' said Tergat in a surprisingly upbeat tone. ''But I thought I might have it this time. Unfortunately I was supposed to start sprinting with 300 to go, but I could not pass. I was trying to find a way to get past earlier, but I did my best. I can do no better than that. I had nothing left at the end.''</p>
        <p>One of the things driving Gebrselassie down the stretch was the understanding that his fellow Ethiopians might not be able to deal with his defeat. ''I think if you came back to Ethiopia and it was a silver or bronze for Haile, I don't think the people would accept it,'' he said. ''I survived today.''</p>
        <p>It has been a year of survival for the 27-year-old who has broken or re-broken 15 world records in his career, has been the subject of a documentary and has not lost at 10,000 meters since 1993 or at 5,000 since 1996. Before Christmas, Gebrselassie began feeling pain in an Achilles' tendon, enough pain to keep him from training and make him think that this Olympic season might be compromised. The pain lingered, and he was still considering whether he could run the 10,000 shortly before the Olympics began. New shoes and constant treatment made it possible.</p>
        <p>Gebrselassie's thrilling victory came on the busiest night of track and field at these Games, with nine finals in all. Gabriela Szabo of Romania, a silver medalist in the 1,500 four years ago, moved up to 5,000 this time and set an Olympic record of 14 minutes 40.79 seconds, 19 seconds faster than the previous record.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, Maria Mutola of Mozambique took the 800 meters in 1:56.15. She won the bronze in 1996.  In the 100-meter hurdles, Anier Garcia of Cuba outran a trio of Americans and won in 13 seconds flat. Allen Johnson of the United States, who won the gold in Atlanta, hit each of the 10 hurdles and finished fourth in 13.23, behind Terrence Trammel and Mark Crear. Colin Jackson of Britain, the world champion, was fifth.</p>
        <p>The triple jump final provided vindication and relief for Jonathan Edwards of Britain, who won the gold with a leap of 58 feet 1 1/4 inches. Edwards had been the favorite to win in Atlanta, but was soundly beaten by an inexperienced American, Kenny Harrison. The loss had haunted him for four years.</p>
        <p>''I thought my best chance to win in the Olympics was Atlanta,'' he said. But at 34 years old and with graying hair, Edwards outperformed everyone.</p>
        <p>In the discus throw, Lithuania's Virgilijus Alekna won with a throw of 227 feet 4 inches. The 1996 Olympic champion, Lars Riedel of Germany, won the silver and Frantz Kruger of South Africa took the bronze.</p>
        <p>But on this night of brilliant competition, the night's most competitive duel belonged to Gebrselassie and Tergat. And as befits a historic occasion, the two will almost certainly never race in a 10,000 meters like this again. Tergat is planning to convert to the half-marathon and marathon, and Gebrselassie is expected to make the same transition.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully, we will meet again,'' Tergat said.</p>
