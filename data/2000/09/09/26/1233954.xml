        <p>Adam Taliaferro, the Penn State freshman cornerback who suffered a spinal injury during a loss to Ohio State on Saturday, underwent successful surgery yesterday in Columbus, Ohio, the school's sports information department announced.</p>
        <p>But Taliaferro, 18, still does not have feeling in his fingers and legs and he remains in serious condition in the intensive care unit of the Ohio State University Medical Center.</p>
        <p>Taliaferro was hurt while attempting a tackle with 99 seconds remaining in a 45-6 Ohio State victory that left the Buckeyes with a 4-0 record and dropped Penn State to 1-4. According to Dr. Wayne Sebastianelli, Penn State's director of athletic medicine, who spoke to the surgeon, Dr. Gary Rea, after the procedure, a metal internal fixation and bone graft were inserted to stabilize the spine in the mid-lower neck area.</p>
        <p>According to the statement released by the university, Taliaferro's spinal cord was bruised but not cut. Taliaferro, a 5-foot-10-inch, 183-pound player from Voorhees, N.J., is able to move his arms, shoulders and wrists. He is expected to remain in Ohio for two to three more days, the university said, and then be transferred to a spinal rehabilitation center in the Philadelphia area.</p>

        <p>GAME-TURNING CALL IN ERROR: The Big Ten officiating coordinator, David Parry, said yesterday that two game-turning fumble calls late in Michigan's 35-31 victory over Illinois on Saturday were mistakes and that Illini Coach Ron Turner had called on the National Collegiate Athletic Association to use instant replay to review such plays.</p>
        <p>Parry said both disputed fumble rulings would have gone Illinois's way instead of Michigan's if an N.F.L.-style instant replay system were in use.</p>
        <p>Parry, who is also the national coordinator of officiating for the N.C.A.A., called instant replay highly, highly unlikely because of the cost and logistics involved in equipping every stadium. Parry acknowledged that the two fumbles in question from Saturday's game would have been overturned after a review of tape. (AP)</p>
