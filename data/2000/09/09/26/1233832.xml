        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick Lazio both claim credit for taking the initiative and agreeing mutually to ban soft-money broadcast ads in their New York Senate campaigns. That is fine with us. Each deserves praise for taking a step that, while limited, could curb an egregious fund-raising abuse and sends a powerful signal to other campaigns around the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's challenge to Mrs. Clinton to sign a soft-money treaty was a centerpiece of his performance in their recent debate. He got mixed reviews for presentation, but the effort was worthwhile. The first lady showed independence and resolve in accepting an accord that puts her at some political disadvantage.</p>
        <p>The Lazio-Clinton accord should not be seen as a substitute for campaign reform legislation that would ban all raising and spending of unlimited party donations from corporations, unions and rich individuals, known as soft money. Under their accord, both candidates will still allow parties and groups supporting them to spend such money on telephone banks, mailings and get-out-the-vote drives. Mrs. Clinton has made it clear that she intends to raise such money for the Democrats to spend on her own race and others, and it would have been better if she had agreed to forgo such activities altogether. But realistically, the ban on raising and spending soft money for television and radio ads was a step in the right direction.</p>
        <p>There have been occasional pacts in the past on limiting fund-raising. The Senate race in 1996 between Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts and his challenger, Gov. William Weld, involved an agreed-upon cap on spending, although some reports suggested that it unraveled at the end. The New York agreement almost ran aground over Mrs. Clinton's demand that outside groups be barred from running ads backing the Republican campaign while outside groups backing her campaign could go ahead. She argued that while Republican groups were sham organizations, the groups backing her were more legitimate.</p>
        <p>Late last week Mrs. Clinton dropped her demand, and it was replaced by an accord on broadcast advertising that resembled a nuclear arms agreement. By its terms, if any independent groups run ads supporting one candidate, the other may authorize the running of ads in some fashion that is proportionate. Each campaign will now have to keep tabs on the other's activities, something they say they can do through the agencies that place ads. Mrs. Clinton has called on the groups supporting her -- notably the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Sierra Club and the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League -- to refrain from television and radio ads. They should do so as a matter of civic-mindedness and loyalty to the candidate they support.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers have already been bombarded by television ads in the Senate race. The ads are likely to continue in some form, because both sides will run them with ''hard money'' raised in chunks no greater than $1,000 per individual and $5,000 per political action committee. The soft-money accord may also lead to a profusion of mailings and phone calls on behalf of candidates.</p>
        <p>But the soft-money deal is important because once again it flies in the face of the argument in Washington that no one really cares about campaign finance reform. Of course if voters did not care, Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton would not have done this deal. Once they adhere to it, their example can pave the way for real reform enacted in Washington.</p>
