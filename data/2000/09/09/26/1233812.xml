        <p>With Fashion Week behind us, it is time now to revisit some of the ideas and philosophies behind the clothes. These may not always be legible in the garments themselves, or for that matter, in the designers' often loopy press notes. Do these explain what the viewer has just seen or obscure it? The answer is not always clear. And that may be the point. Nobody is looking to Marc Jacobs for a sequel to the ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.'' And let's face it: Ludwig Wittgenstein probably couldn't baste a hem.</p>

        <p>With Fashion Week behind us, it is time now to revisit some of the ideas and philosophies behind the clothes. These may not always be legible in the garments themselves, or for that matter, in the designers' often loopy press notes. Do these explain what the viewer has just seen or obscure it? The answer is not always clear. And that may be the point. Nobody is looking to Marc Jacobs for a sequel to the ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.'' And let's face it: Ludwig Wittgenstein probably couldn't baste a hem.</p>
        <p>To review: In a loft space near the Hudson River on 14th Street, Walter van Beirendonck -- one of that crop of what Sarah Hailes, a co-owner of the SoHo boutique Kirna Zabete, has characterized as the ''crazy Belgian designers'' -- showed his spring line in the form of oversize Cibachrome photos and on videotape.</p>
        <p>Mr. van Beirendonck, who affects a biblical beard and wears so many oversize rings that the effect is of silver knuckles, titled the collection Starship Earth, in homage to Buckminster Fuller's prophetic writings. The designer explained in a series of notes that he was inspired by a picture he once saw of pilgrims ''showing their faith in the name of God by wearing the Holy Name, Rama, written in Sanskrit, across their faces and printed on their clothing.'' Oh.</p>
        <p>John Bartlett also struck a sacral note, with rope as his theme: ''Erotic. Sacred. Tightening the knot that frees our duality.'' There were lariats on shoulders, references to body piercing, belts that looked as if they had been borrowed from a dominatrix's tool kit. There was, too, a wall of seminaked men, their bodies whitewashed, and a pulsating orb on the runway into which a mysterious viscous substance was released from the tent roof by drops. ''What is that?'' one viewer inquired. ''Don't know,'' his baffled seatmate said. ''All I can think of is, 'Got milk?' ads.''</p>
        <p>At the downtown label Slinky Vagabond, the text extended the seasonal quasi-mystical theme: ''Meekness is powerful; it harbors no evil thoughts. That is a Buddha.'' And at Donna Karan, who apparently never met an incense stick she didn't like, inspiration came from a polymorphic global ideal, a person who is, as her notes said, ''a sexy study in contradiction, feminine and masculine, manicured and thrown, forever blurring her night into day.''</p>
        <p>The Brazilian designer Fause Haten found his enlightenment with dresses that used oversized jelly-bean prints to convey the ''intent of felicity.'' All of life is an inspiration, Mr. Haten wrote, ''while intent is an actual focus of wishes given to one who wears the clothes.'' Provided you're not blurring night into day.</p>
        <p>Among the more forthright designers was Carolina Herrera, whose pretty spring clothes were designed for a woman who is ''fluid, feminine, polished and pulled together.'' (Enough of this duality.) Bryan Bradley and Josh Patner of Tuleh alluded to both the drawings of the late fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez and a time of ''innocent madness'' (read: pre-AIDS) when there was ''no greater joy than the smile of a particular kind of woman caught somewhere between grace and the devil.''</p>
        <p>The gifted designer Gene Meyer also showed pretty clothes, alas for men, 20 of whom he sent onto the runway with teased and back-combed hair accompanied by a soundtrack of rockabilly music and a theme of ''tall hair and one cowboy hat.'' (What? For all 20?)</p>
        <p>The theme of Helmut Lang's show of characteristically rigorous garments (some black with your gray?) was ''When Love Comes to Town.'' Critics likened Mr. Lang's output to that of Azzedine Alaia and of Herve Leger, and also to bondage garments. It would certainly seem as if, when love comes to Mr. Lang's part of town, it is time to bring out the handcuffs. Yet Mr. Lang steadfastly claimed that his collection was inspired by antique entomological prints. And his press notes sought earnestly to convey the, uh, sprightliness of that: ''Henny Penny, Loosy Goosy, Turkey Lurkey Meet Foxy Loxy,'' read a printed flyer placed on every seat at the Dia Center for the Arts. Penny, Goosy, Lurkey, Loxy, chat among yourselves.</p>
        <p>And finally, there was Diane Von Furstenberg, who presented a collection of filmy and adaptable dresses under the rubric Hotel Life. They were, the designer explained, intended for the woman with ''a spirit of adventure, an international flavor, an irresistible easiness, ready for anything at a moment's notice.'' Just because the type of woman Ms. Von Furstenberg seemed to be describing can often be found advertising her irresistible easiness in the Yellow Pages, it should not be inferred that the clothes were less than charming and ladylike. They were both. Ms. Von Furstenberg's room service muse is not that other kind of girl.</p>
