        <p>Ask the players on the United States softball team to describe their first week at the Olympics, and they use the same word: nightmare. After winning their first two games, the team lost three in a row, shattering a 112-game winning streak and putting a gold medal seemingly out of reach.</p>
        <p>Tonight, however, the defending Olympic champions continued their long climb out of the abyss, capitalizing on the fiery pitching of Lisa Fernandez to beat Australia, 1-0, and advance to the gold medal game on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Fernandez struck out eight straight Australian hitters between the fourth and seventh innings. Her pitches had a combination of speed -- some were clocked at 62 miles an hour -- and pinpoint placement.</p>
        <p>''I just kept telling myself, 'Oh God, please help me,' '' a jubilant Fernandez said afterward. ''It was actually a sense of relief knowing that I held the outcome of the game in my hands.''</p>
        <p>The victory over Australia, which wound up with the bronze medal, was sweet for several reasons. It came on the heels of the team's 3-0 victory over China in the semifinals this morning. And it came over a team that had beaten the United States, 2-1, last Thursday.</p>
        <p>''We could have easily folded up our bags and said, 'We're done,' after the losses,'' said catcher Stacey Nuveman, who hit the game-winning three-run home run against China and kicked off the rally in tonight's game.</p>
        <p>But the United States seemed anything but rattled against Australia. With Fernandez on the mound, as well as a strong Australian pitcher, Kelly Hardie, the teams played four scoreless innings to start the game. Then a fielding error by Australia in the bottom of the fifth broke it open.</p>
        <p>A ball hit by Nuveman bounced past shortstop Natalie Ward. Nuveman was replaced on first base by the pinch-runner Jennifer McFalls. Leah O'Brien-Amico followed with a single, advancing McFalls to second. That brought up Dot Richardson, the team captain and second baseman, who hit a blistering single into center field to score McFalls.</p>
        <p>''My job is to put the ball to the bat,'' said Richardson, adding that her other major contribution was to shout encouragement to Fernandez.</p>
        <p>After striking out the Australian side in the fifth and sixth innings, Fernandez finally gave up two hits. But the two final plays summed up the evening for the Australians. Peta Edebone, the left fielder who did damage in Australia's first Olympic tournament game against the United States, grounded out to third base. And Joanne Brown made the last out by hitting a short-hop grounder back to Fernandez.</p>
        <p>Fernandez said she did not try to throw strikes at the end of the game, relying instead on her teammates to make the plays.</p>
        <p>Although Fernandez was scorching today, the coach of the United States team, Ralph Raymond, deflected a question about his choice of a starting pitcher on Tuesday. ''I'm thinking of Greg Maddux,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In facing Japan for a gold medal on Tuesday, the United States has the chance for a remarkable feat of redemption. Japan is the third team that defeated the Americans during the disastrous round-robin event here, along with China and Australia. The Americans have now vanquished two of the three.</p>
        <p>Several of the United States players said they did not sleep well after the three defeats. Many said they were bolstered by the United States women's soccer team, which turned up in the stands tonight to cheer raucously. The loudest cheers, however, came from the home team's fans between the third and fourth innings, when word of the Australian runner Cathy Freeman's victory in the 400-meter race spread through the crowd.</p>
        <p>''It was a nightmare,'' Richardson said about last week, repeating that word. ''But when you have a nightmare, you wake up. And we woke up in time.''</p>
