        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The application of the death penalty in the United States is biased against the poor and people of color, and characterized by a shocking number of erroneous convictions. And as you report (front page, Sept. 22), the presence of a death penalty does not decrease homicides in a state.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, the Justice Department issued a study showing that the application of the death penalty at both the federal and state levels depends more on race and geography than on the nature of the alleged crime. A recent Columbia Law School report concluded that capital sentences are ''persistently and systematically fraught with alarming amounts of error.''</p>
        <p>What these studies show and what the American people are realizing is that the death penalty is unnecessary and beyond repair. There should be a moratorium on state and federal executions. Let's call the death penalty what it is: a human rights violation that must end once and for all.</p>
        <p>WILLIAM F. SCHULZ  Washington, Sept. 25, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A.</p>
