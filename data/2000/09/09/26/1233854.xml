        <p>A homeless man who thrust a rush-hour commuter into the path of an oncoming subway train last year, severing his legs, intended to kill him, a defense lawyer acknowledged yesterday in opening statements of the trial of the man charged with the attack.</p>
        <p>But she said that her client, Julio Perez, 44, suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and believed that the commuter, Edgar Rivera, was an assassin hired to kill him. So he acted in self-defense, the lawyer, Stephanie Kaplan, argued.</p>
        <p>The issue of Mr. Perez's mental state will clearly frame the trial, as the two sides painted different pictures of why he pushed Mr. Rivera onto the tracks as he stood on a Manhattan subway platform during rush hour.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor, Peter Casolaro, an assistant district attorney, described Mr. Perez as a manipulative drug addict with murderous intent. Despite 20 years of treatment for mental illness, Mr. Perez was not as sick as he seemed, Mr. Casolaro said, and was ''more than capable'' of pursuing a daily routine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perez picked up prescription medicines, attended a support group at the homeless shelter where he lived and even wisely managed the money he got from Social Security,  Mr. Casolaro said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kaplan painted a far darker picture of Mr. Perez's world and the delusions that she said warred within him. ''He pushed Edgar Rivera because it was all he could do to kill one of the enemy, to save his own life,'' she said, trying to impress upon the jury that Mr. Perez is severely mentally ill and not just ''a little weird,'' as she said the prosecution would suggest.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Perez sat placidly in a turtleneck and green sweater, she concluded, ''He doesn't have to be incapacitated and drooling in a corner to be a paranoid schizophrenic.''</p>
        <p>In psychiatric evaluations, Mr. Perez was found mentally sound enough to stand trial.</p>
        <p>The subway motorman and a firefighter who first reached Mr. Rivera, 38, also testified about the attack. At approximately 5:30 p.m. on April 28, 1999, Mr. Rivera, a father of three and a messenger at a Manhattan printing shop, stood on the platform of the Lexington Avenue subway station at 51st Street.</p>
        <p>''He had no idea,'' Mr. Casolaro told the jury, ''that it was the last time in his life that he would ever walk again.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Perez, then 43, had a record of convictions for drug possession, robbery and harassment, and was then living in a Washington Heights shelter and being treated under at a program run by New York Presbyterian Hospital that treats schizophrenics.</p>
        <p>He stepped forward and thrust Mr. Rivera into the tracks, just as the No.  6 train was entering the station.</p>
        <p>The motorman, Timothy Quigley, testified that he hit the emergency brake as he saw Mr. Rivera fall to the tracks but that the train was going 20 miles an hour and did not immediately stop. Mr. Quigley said that he watched as Mr. Rivera tried to dive into a small crawl space just under the platform. He managed to get his torso out of the way, but not his legs. Remarkably, Mr. Rivera, who lay wedged between the first and second cars, survived and began a lengthy recovery.</p>
