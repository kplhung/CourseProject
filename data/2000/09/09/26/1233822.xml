        <p>Calling a young man up to the stage, Rabbi Yehuda Deri beamed as the youth was draped in a prayer shawl and vowed to become an observant Jew.</p>
        <p>''Blessed are you, Lord, for letting us live to reach this moment,'' the young man recited as a hearty ''Amen'' went up from the crowd in a tent set up here in a dusty lot outside Maasiyahu Prison. Other young men followed in turn, taking the stage to commit themselves to the faith.</p>
        <p>The prison holds Rabbi Deri's brother, Aryeh Deri, the charismatic leader of the strictly Orthodox Shas Party of Sephardic Jews who was sent to prison on Sept. 3 for corruption. Since then the area near the jail has mushroomed into a pilgrimage site where hundreds -- and sometimes thousands -- of people gather nightly for the Jewish equivalent of a religious revival meeting.</p>
        <p>The gatherings have taken on a life of their own, drawing mostly Sephardic Jews of Middle Eastern and North African origin, many from economically depressed communities. There are newly religious young men and people who are already strictly Orthodox, as well as the nonobservant.</p>
        <p>Every night men, women and children stream to the prison area in a demonstration of ethnic resentment and religious fervor that echoes the discontents of Israel's underclass.</p>
        <p>To them Mr. Deri is a Sephardic martyr, his imprisonment the latest example of oppression by a secular elite of European background.</p>
        <p>''I've realized that I'm a stranger in my own country,'' said Hillel Tzabari, 50, of Ramat Gan.</p>
        <p>The nightly meetings, which include prayer, sermons and song, seem to offer many who take part the solace of faith, resembling pilgrimages to tombs of holy men across Israel, where people pray for divine help to heal sickness, find a spouse or bear children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deri himself has been transformed by his followers into something of a saint, a suffering servant of the Torah whose mere presence in a nearby cell has already worked wonders. ''Every day that he's there, people are returning to religion,'' said a woman from Tel Aviv.</p>
        <p>The scenes near the jail, which have also drawn strictly Orthodox Ashkenazic Jews of European origin, have led some experts to suggest that something new is in the making, inspired by Mr. Deri's imprisonment but reflecting broad undercurrents in Israeli society.</p>
        <p>''This is a grass-roots religious movement that goes beyond Shas, that unites various people who reject Israeliness, with its secular modernism,'' said Avirama Golan, who writes about religious politics for the newspaper Haaretz.</p>
        <p>The lines have been drawn more sharply in recent weeks as a public debate has grown over proposals by Prime Minister Ehud Barak to push through a ''civil reform'' program that would remove constraints of religious law from various aspects of public life.</p>
        <p>His suggestions include speeding up legislation for a constitution, which Israel has never had, as well as sanctioning civil marriages and running bus and national airline services on the Jewish Sabbath.</p>
        <p>Menachem Friedman of Bar-Ilan University, an expert on radical religious movements, said the people drawn to the gatherings near Mr. Deri's prison were from parts of Israeli society that felt economically marginalized and overtaken by Israel's increasingly globalized culture.</p>
        <p>''The huge growth in social gaps in Israel has left these people at a dead end,'' he said. ''They feel left behind, that their identity has been erased. ''They're saying, 'We have a home, we have warmth, we have togetherness and we have a face -- we're not just anybody.' ''</p>
        <p>The lot outside the jail, a makeshift yeshiva by day, was transformed into a religious bazaar on a recent night. Peddlers hawked cassettes of rabbinical sermons and religious books, charms, amulets, candles, bottles of oil, posters of revered rabbis, skullcaps for men and hats for women, and even electrical appliances. Sitting next to a Torah scroll strung with flashing lights, a man urged people to sign up to sponsor the copying of a new scroll in honor of Mr. Deri. On the main stage, a prayer leader led recitations for the penitential Jewish month of Elul, and speakers praised Mr. Deri and exhorted the crowd to pray for his speedy release.</p>
        <p>''You can feel the sacredness of this place,'' said Meir Levy, from Ramle. ''After work you come right here without even going home. It pulls you like a magnet.''</p>
        <p>Shlomo Vaknin, a soldier on leave sporting a big white skullcap, said he had become a regular at the nightly gatherings although he was not an observant Jew.</p>
        <p>''I'm slowly getting close to Judaism, feeling more comfortable with it, more whole,'' he said. ''There are no class differences here. People treat each other with respect.''</p>
        <p>David Cohen, an unemployed drug addict from nearby Lod, said he had come to get help. ''I want to listen to words of Torah, to get stronger and to find someone who can refer me to a rehabilitation program,'' he said. Later, he was brought on stage to proclaim his return to religion.</p>
        <p>Mike Nissim, a newly religious follower of the 19th-century Hasidic rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, said the meetings brought people together. ''I like the unity here, Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews, strictly Orthodox with secular people,'' he said. ''You see the people of Israel getting close to the Creator.''</p>
