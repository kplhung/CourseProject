        <p>A whiff of scandal crossed the political aisle here today when a former Socialist cabinet official acknowledged that he was given a copy of a videotape that accuses President Jacques Chirac of illegal activities, but did not notify the authorities during the two years he had the tape.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac quickly called on the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, for a speedy investigation into whether Mr. Jospin's former finance minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, got the potentially damaging tape from a lawyer in exchange for giving a huge tax break to one of the lawyer's clients.</p>

        <p>A whiff of scandal crossed the political aisle here today when a former Socialist cabinet official acknowledged that he was given a copy of a videotape that accuses President Jacques Chirac of illegal activities, but did not notify the authorities during the two years he had the tape.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac quickly called on the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, for a speedy investigation into whether Mr. Jospin's former finance minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, got the potentially damaging tape from a lawyer in exchange for giving a huge tax break to one of the lawyer's clients.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jospin, who said he knew nothing about the tape until he read transcripts from it in Le Monde last Thursday, promised a swift inquiry and said Mr. Strauss-Kahn would hand over all relevant documents to investigators by the end of the day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac has denied the accusations made on the videotape, but the detailed account of a vast illicit fund-raising scheme has nonetheless dominated the news here. On the tape, the former party official, Jean-Claude Mery, describes in detail the vast network of kickback schemes he oversaw that brought Mr. Chirac's party millions of dollars a year in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mery said he worked under instructions from Mr. Chirac, who was the mayor of Paris at the time and the leader of his Rally for the Republic party. The tape was made in 1996, when Mr. Mery, who has since died of cancer, was being investigated for illegal fund-raising. He says on the tape that he made it to protect himself.</p>
        <p>The role of Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a close friend of Mr. Jospin, did not come to light until Sunday night when a respected weekly magazine, L'Express, which was to have printed the article on Wednesday, put it on its Web site.</p>
        <p>The L'Express story says that a lawyer who helped Mr. Mery make his tape gave the cassette to Mr. Strauss-Kahn in the summer of 1998 in exchange for a huge tax break for one of his other clients, Karl Lagerfeld, the fashion designer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who was forced last year to resign his ministerial post after allegations of false accounting at his law firm, denied all wrongdoing in the case.</p>
        <p>''I deny all political connections that people are trying to make as well as any connections with any tax dossier,'' he said. He added that the lawyer who gave him the tape, Alain Belot, was an associate who gave him the tape because he thought it was interesting. ''I didn't think it was worth looking at and made no use of it,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn said. ''I don't even know where I put it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lagerfeld's fashion company, Lagerfeld Gallery in Paris, said he was traveling in Italy and could not be reached. Mr. Belot did not return calls to his office.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Chirac and Mr. Jospin are longtime archrivals likely to meet again in the 2002 presidential elections, they seemed to be in the same boat today.</p>
        <p>The scandal enveloped them both as did the lingering sense of failure and poor timing that accompanied the results of a referendum on Sunday on whether the president's term should be cut to five years from seven.</p>
        <p>The referendum, which both supported, was approved easily. But nearly 70 percent of the voters did not bother to go to the polls and another 5 percent (nearly two million people) registered their disdain for the question by leaving their envelopes empty or filling them with a ripped up ballot.</p>
        <p>Many voters complained that they would rather have been consulted on more pressing matters, like tax cuts or the 35-hour workweek that the government has been putting in place during the last two years.</p>
        <p>Both men were heavily criticized in newspaper editorials today as totally out of touch with the population.</p>
        <p>Accusations of corruption and illegal fund-raising are not new to any of France's major parties. But the Mery tape has provided the kind of drama that seems to have brought even France's most cynical citizens to attention.</p>
        <p>On the tapes, Mr. Mery, both a developer and a member of the governing committee of the Rally for the Republic party, described how he got kickbacks from almost everyone who wanted to do business with the city, particularly those who wanted to build housing for the poor. On one occasion, Mr. Mery said that Mr. Chirac was present when he handed one of his aides $700,000 in cash.</p>
        <p>The tape would be questionable evidence in court because Mr. Mery cannot be cross-examined. But magistrates investigating illicit fund-raising were nevertheless interested enough on Friday to search the offices of the journalist who helped Mr. Mery make his tape. Today, several magistrates were supposed to go to a bank vault to obtain an envelope Mr. Mery apparently gave one of his lawyers for safekeeping.</p>
        <p>While both Mr. Jospin and Mr. Chirac are now at the center of the growing political storm, they arrived there along different paths. Mr. Jospin, stiff and earnest, has a squeaky-clean reputation that could be shattered by the scandal. He has held his ministers to high standards, for instance, that insisting Mr. Strauss-Kahn leave the government until he had cleared his name, though no charges have been forthcoming.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac, on the other hand, who exudes warmth on the campaign trail, is no stranger to accusations of wrongdoing. He cannot be criminally prosecuted as long as he is president. The courts made that ruling last year, after evidence emerged linking him with the practice of giving party workers government salaries, though they never showed up to do the government job.</p>
        <p>But the accusations on the Mery tape are the most direct so far, and could clearly have an impact on his bid for re-election.</p>
        <p>When transcripts of the Mery tape were first published in Le Monde, Mr. Chirac made the highly unusual decision to go on television that night to dispute them. He called the accusations as an ''abracadabra story'' that amounted to no more than producing ''a man who had been dead more than a year, laying out implausible events that supposedly happened more than 14 years ago.''</p>
