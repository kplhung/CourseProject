        <p>Less than a week after the charismatic Romanian Andreea Raducan won the prestigious Olympic all-around gold medal with a style some compared to Nadia Comaneci, she was stripped of her medal today after testing positive for a banned drug.</p>
        <p>A Romanian team doctor administered the drug stimulant pseudoephedrine to the 16-year-old Raducan in the form of a cold medicine. Dr. Ioachin Oana was held responsible and expelled from the Games.</p>
        <p>Raducan is the first gymnast to be stripped of a medal because of a drug violation. She is the second athlete at these Games to lose a gold, and it was the sixth positive drug case at the Sydney Games.</p>
        <p>''A team physician should be able to read a bloody label on a package,'' said Dick Pound, vice president of the International Olympic Committee and head of the I.O.C.'s World Anti-Doping Agency. ''It was reckless on the part of the physician. His athlete tested positive; and because of it, her medal was withdrawn.''</p>
        <p>[A short article in today's Sydney 2000 section reported that the I.O.C. medical commission had recommended that Raducan be stripped of her all-around medal. The actual suspension occurred after that article was already printed.]</p>
        <p>Raducan, the first Romanian to win the gold in the all-around since Comaneci, was allowed to keep the gold she won as a part of the team competition and also the silver medal she won in the vault. But with Raducan's disqualification, the Romanian sweep of the all-around medals came to an end. The Romanian Simona Amanar claims the gold in the individual all-around competition, and her teammate, Maria Olaru, moves up from bronze to silver. Liu Xuan of China, who placed fourth, is the bronze medalist.</p>
        <p>According to a statement issued today by the I.O.C.'s executive board, the presence of the banned substance was detected in the A urine sample. The Romanian delegation was informed of the results on Monday, and they requested a B sample be tested. The results were the same.</p>
        <p>''We believe this case is completely irrelevant,'' Ion Tiriac, the president of the Romanian National Olympic Committee, told The Associated Press. ''The athlete is the best gymnast in the world at this time -- she has proved it.''</p>
        <p>Raducan was part of a mighty Romanian gymnastics team. On Thursday night, she stood atop her coach's shoulders and smiled brightly after her dominating performance.</p>
        <p>''I'm very proud of them,'' said Bela Karolyi, the United States team coordinator, who laid the groundwork for the Romanian program. ''I feel good about what has happened to their program.''</p>
        <p>Raducan has been the sparkling ornament on the Romanian program. She has steadily risen through the factory-like system in Romania and become one of the elite gymnasts.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Russian Svetlana Khorkina -- who was one of the favorites for the gold, but saw that chance ruined by an error in the vault measurement -- Raducan revealed herself to be the template for the gymnastic pixie. At 4 feet 10 inches, and only 82 pounds, she is the perfect size to impress the judges. She is also better equipped to adjust on the fly. But now, after a team physician administered Nurofen, an over-the-counter cold medicine with the banned drug, Raducan has been stripped of her glory.</p>
        <p>''Unless the physician is a moron, he should know what he is giving an athlete,'' Pound said. ''If there is a presence of a banned drug, he should be able to realize that.''</p>
