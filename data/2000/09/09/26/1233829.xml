        <p>In an effort to improve a strained relationship, Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, met tonight for the first time since the Camp David peace talks ended two months ago.</p>
        <p>Israeli and Palestinian officials do not expect anything tangible to come from the closed-door, late-night meeting. They do not presume to hope that the deadlock in the peace negotiations will be broken.</p>
        <p>Rather, relations have deteriorated to the point where a mere meeting of the leaders is considered progress, and especially one held in an intimate setting -- in Mr. Barak's private home in the central Israeli town of Kochav Yair, according to the Israeli radio.</p>
        <p>After the three-hour meeting ended, Gadi Baltiansky, Mr. Barak's spokesman said in a statement that it had been held ''in a very good atmosphere and a positive spirit.''</p>
        <p>For weeks, Mr. Barak had insisted that there was no point in a meeting if Mr. Arafat did not agree in advance to consider American proposals to bridge the differences between them, especially on the seemingly intractable issue of Jerusalem's status. But under pressure from American officials and from dovish Israeli ministers, particularly Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, Mr. Barak dropped his precondition. President Clinton called and spoke with Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat during the meeting, Mr. Barak's office said.</p>
        <p>After the Kochav Yair meeting, senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are expected to fly to Washington for talks in the next few days. American mediators have prepared a working paper that summarizes points of concord and differences between the parties and suggests solutions, but it is unclear whether they will use the document.</p>
        <p>The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said today that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright informed Mr. Barak and Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben Ami over the weekend that the Americans were going to hold off on presenting the document. The newspaper said the Americans had identified too many disparities on almost every issue to formulate a workable overall proposal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ben Ami visited Amman, Jordan, and Cairo today to promote the idea of entrusting the sacred heart of the Old City, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al Sharif, to the United Nations Security Council to resolve conflicting Israeli and Palestinian demands for sovereignty over the site.</p>
        <p>Speaking in English to reporters, Mr. Ben Ami announced, ''There is going to be an agreement this week!'' Quickly, he corrected himself and said he had meant a meeting, not an agreement. Then he repeated his mistake, laughing and saying his dual slips revealed how badly he wanted a breakthrough.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak told his cabinet this weekend that he would be willing to accept a partial deal with the Palestinians that set a time line for resolving issues, like Jerusalem. Haaretz endorsed the idea in an editorial today as a way to ''prevent a crisis.''</p>
        <p>But the Palestinians have rejected both the proposal for United Nations control over the site and the idea of a partial agreement.</p>
        <p>If tonight's meeting is meant to re-establish a link between the two leaders, that will be no easy feat. A senior American official said recently that Mr. Arafat never cottoned to Mr. Barak's terse military manner, and that the Americans constantly find themselves trying to interpret Mr. Barak's intentions to Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>Muhammed Rachid, a senior economic adviser to Mr. Arafat, said rapport between the two leaders never gelled. This summer, right before Camp David, Mr. Rachid said Mr. Barak always gave the impression that he thought he was smarter than anyone else in the room; and maybe he was, Mr. Rachid allowed.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Barak made it clear that he felt that if he just had several minutes alone with each individual, he could convince them all that his way was right for everybody, Mr. Rachid said.</p>
        <p>And, Mr. Rachid suggested, that is not a good way to do business with Mr. Arafat.</p>
