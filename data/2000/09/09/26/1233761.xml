        <p>If a child at the Enrico Fermi School in Yonkers is found to have attention deficit disorder, parents can choose an unusual alternative to medication: neurofeedback, a computerized biofeedback system that some say strengthens the brain.</p>
        <p>Linda Vergara, the school's principal, said she decided to try the approach when doctors diagnosed the disorder in her son in 1992. ''They told me I needed to give him something to calm him down,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vergara decided not to give her son Ritalin, the drug frequently used to treat the ailment, and instead took him to see Dr. Mary Jo Sabo, a psychologist in Suffern, N.Y., to try neurofeedback.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vergara said she saw her son become calmer, and he began doing his homework without being asked. She and Dr. Sabo brought the technique to Fermi, a public elementary school with 900 children.</p>
        <p>Now, five years after the program began, nearly 300 children have been treated at no charge with neurofeedback at Fermi and two other public schools in Yonkers for a variety of problems, including A.D.D., learning disabilities and depression.</p>
        <p>''There are children who see tremendous gains and some who see minimal changes,'' said Ms. Vergara. ''Over all, the kids can focus better and have better self-esteem. There are fewer suspensions, better attendance and fewer late kids.''</p>
        <p>Generally relegated to the fringes by mainstream scientists when it was introduced in the 1970's, brain wave biofeedback -- now called neurofeedback or neuro therapy -- has returned. Its effectiveness boosted by computers, it has made its way into mainstream health care, largely as a treatment for attention deficit disorder, but also for depression, head injuries, sleep disorders and other problems.</p>
        <p>Critics say that not enough research has been conducted on the technique to justify any claims for its effectiveness. Critics say that improvements in the patients probably stem from a placebo response and that parents should be aware that the technique is highly experimental.</p>
        <p>''If you give a child four extra hours a week of one-on-one attention you'll see some improvement,'' said Dr. Larry B. Silver, who has been treating attention deficit disorder in the Washington area since 1964. ''But will it last a week or a month later? There has been no follow-up.''</p>
        <p>The disorder, Dr. Silver said, is ''a neurochemical deficiency.'' He added: ''And the only thing that will raise the levels of neurochemicals is medication. We've found no alternatives.''</p>
        <p>One of the hundreds of clinics in the United States offering the treatment is Connecticut Educational Services in Middletown, Conn., which specializes in treating A.D.D., hyperactivity and traumatic brain injury. Dr. Robert Reynolds, the psychologist who operates the clinic, said the technique brought about long-term changes in the brain's functions.</p>
        <p>''About half the children we treat get off medication completely,'' Dr. Reynolds said. ''The other half reduce their medication.''</p>
        <p>Brain wave training, he said, is part of a package of treatments that includes family counseling and behavioral therapy. But the brain wave training, he said, is key.</p>
        <p>''We did all these things without the neurofeedback and they didn't work as well,'' Dr. Reynolds said. A testing and treatment package costs around $4,500 at the clinic.</p>
        <p>Most neurofeedback systems use one or two dime-size sensors placed on the scalp. The sensors read the subtle electrical frequencies of the brain. The signal is amplified and displayed on a computer, and a clinician can see where the client needs to alter the range of frequencies.</p>
        <p>The patients sit at computers playing video games, which respond to their brain waves to challenge them. Their success at the game is tied to their ability to expand the range of their brain waves. After 20 to 40 sessions the brain changes are set in place, practitioners say.</p>
        <p>''It's brain exercise,'' said Dr. Alan J. Strohmeyer, chief of the Biofeedback Section of the Department of Neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and an assistant professor of neuroscience and neurology at the New York University School of Medicine. ''There's a direct correlation between neurofeedback and getting in shape physically at a gym. Neurofeedback helps the brain grow and develop normally.''</p>
        <p>Neurofeedback is a carry-over from the behavioral school of psychology. In the 1970's, a researcher at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Sepulveda, Calif., accidentally discovered that neurofeedback could help some people control epileptic seizures.</p>
        <p>The researcher, Dr. M. Barry Sterman, now a professor emeritus at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, had conditioned cats' brain waves for a sleep study. Coincidentally, he used some of those cats in a study of the hazards of rocket fuel for the Defense Department. Most of the cats exposed to the rocket fuel went into seizures, except those that had received brain wave training. Dr. Sterman then tried the technique on people with epilepsy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sterman concluded that those cats had increased their resistance to seizures by strengthening their brain. In several controlled, randomized studies he tested the technique on epileptic patients and reported that they had far fewer seizures. The results were published in journals and replicated in other studies.</p>
        <p>Although it appeared effective, the technique was put aside in favor of new drugs. Later, Dr. Joel Lubar, a psychologist at the University of Tennessee, adapted the technique to treat attention deficit disorder.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Edward Hallowell, a psychiatrist who teaches at Harvard Medical School, has criticized the costs. It is not that neurofeedback does not work, said Dr. Hallowell, who wrote ''Driven to Distraction: Recognizing and Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder from Childhood Through Adulthood.''</p>
        <p>The treatment, he said, does work well for some people. He even refers some patients for the treatment. ''The problem,'' he said, ''is that it's time consuming and it's expensive. Those are real obstacles.''</p>
        <p>A full course of testing and treatment ranges from $1,500 to $5,000 or more. While some insurance companies pay for the treatment, most do not.</p>
        <p>No one knows precisely how the brain responds to the neurofeedback training, though recent research on the brain's ability to change offers some explanation.</p>
        <p>Dr. Henry Markram, a professor and senior scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and an expert in neuroplasticity, took his 9-year-old daughter to a psychologist in Toronto who treats A.D.D. with neurofeedback. ''It was very effective,'' he said. ''I'm very pleased with the effects.''</p>
        <p>''The brain is incredibly plastic and incredibly responsive,'' Dr. Markram said. ''Neurofeedback is in keeping with that.''</p>
