        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Buchanan Forcefully Strikes Familiar Notes in Speech at Bob Jones University'' (news article, Sept. 19), you refer to the university's ''disagreement with the Roman Catholic Church.''</p>
        <p>On the university's Web site, under the heading ''The Truth About Bob Jones University,'' the following sentence appears: ''We love the practicing Catholic and earnestly desire to see him accept the Christ of the Cross, leave the false system that has enslaved his soul, and enjoy the freedom of sins forgiven that is available for any of us in Christ alone.''</p>
        <p>This rhetoric does not sound like ''disagreement'' but a view of Catholicism that makes it the religious equivalent of the ''evil empire.'' Is that indeed the truth about Bob Jones University?</p>
        <p>(Msgr.) FRANCIS J. MANISCALCO  Director of Communications  United States Catholic Conference  Washington, Sept. 19, 2000</p>
