        <p>The Senate voted overwhelmingly today to approve a $7.8 billion plan intended to restore the Everglades and its ecosystem, a project supporters say is the most ambitious environmental restoration effort ever.</p>
        <p>The plan, drafted by the Army Corps of Engineers, would revamp South Florida's water supply by capturing and storing more rainwater, then redirecting its flow into the Everglades. It comes after years of delicate negotiations among the Clinton administration, Florida, Congress and an unlikely coalition of environmental groups, sugar barons, utility companies, home builders and the Indian tribes that live on the land.</p>
        <p>In a rare bipartisan twist, the project also made allies of Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee; Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican opponent; and Mr. Bush's younger brother Jeb, the Republican governor of Florida. All three men support the plan, in which Mr. Gore took an active interest early on and which Jeb Bush helped complete.</p>
        <p>Florida has the fourth largest number of electoral votes in the presidential election, and the Texas governor and the vice president are engaged in a fierce contest to win over voters there.</p>
        <p>The Senate approved the plan, which is attached to a larger bill on water resources, by a vote of 85 to 1. Now attention turns to the House, where the measure is tangled in unrelated partisan disputes. The House has not scheduled a vote, but Florida Republicans said today that they would pursue several strategies to pass the measure.</p>
        <p>''It's truly bipartisan, it's truly historic,'' said Senator Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire, the Republican chairman of the Committee on the Environment and Public Works.</p>
        <p>''This is a national treasure,'' Mr. Smith said. ''It is a vast freshwater marsh, which once was connected by the flow of water, a sheet of water, a river of water, flowing south from Lake Okeechobee all the way into the Gulf of Mexico.''</p>
        <p>''But now the Everglades is in peril,'' he said. ''It is half the size it used to be.''</p>
        <p>By redirecting the flow of water into the Everglades, which includes Everglades National Park, the legislation aims to resuscitate the 12 million acres of saw grass and swamp that cut across southern Florida and revitalize its dying plants and animals. As many as 68 plant and animal species in the Everglades are fighting extinction.</p>
        <p>At the same time, backers of the plan say it would ensure an adequate supply of fresh water for South Florida cities and farms, a major concern to local governments, Florida utilities, the sugar industry and citrus farmers.</p>
        <p>The bill calls for the federal government to split the $7.8 billion cost  with the state, a tacit recognition of the federal role in damaging the Everglades. In 1948, facing severe flooding in South Florida, Congress ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to reroute the flow of water.</p>
        <p>The corps built a series of levees and canals that changed the natural flow of water into the Everglades and shunted 1.7 billion gallons of fresh water into the ocean every day. The Everglades wound up receiving too little water in the dry season and too much in the rainy season.</p>
        <p>While the work made the East Coast safe for development and permitted the lucrative sugar industry to flourish, it also drained the Everglades of fresh water and nearly killed it.</p>
        <p>Although the project is expected to take 30 to 40 years to complete, the bill would establish the Army corps' plan as the framework for the restoration. The plan was first submitted two years ago. The bill would also authorize the first $1.1 billion for 10 of the 68 projects in the plan.</p>
        <p>''It is the largest, most complex environmental restoration project, not only in the history of the United States of America but in the history of the world,'' said Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat, who worked closely with his Republican colleague, Connie Mack, in support of the program.</p>
        <p>To keep track of the costs, which a few senators viewed as exorbitant, the legislation states that no individual project can go 20 percent over budget without an explanation to Congress. And it instructs the corps to return periodically for more money.</p>
        <p>Most environmental groups signed on to the project early, although a few question whether so complicated and untested a plan is truly necessary. The Corps of Engineers, they say, must be closely watched as it carries out such a complex project over such an extended period.</p>
        <p>''The details, design and operation phases are things that will need monitoring constantly,'' said Stuart Strahl, president and chief executive  of Audubon Florida. ''But this is a huge step.''</p>
        <p>Environmental groups have also raised concerns about a proposal to convert the former Homestead Air Reserve base into a commercial airport. The base, which sits near the Everglades, was demolished by Hurricane Andrew. Environmental impact studies say the noise and pollution generated by an airport could cause further harm to the Everglades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has been criticized in Florida by environmental groups -- traditional allies of his -- for not taking a strong position on the proposed airport.</p>
        <p>Responding to the criticism, Jim Kennedy, a Gore spokesman, said today that Mr. Gore ''believes any actions taken by federal agencies should not jeopardize the progress we've made in restoring the Everglades.''</p>
        <p>The Senate included in the bill nonbinding language, drafted by Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, urging that the redevelopment of the former base be consistent with the restoration of the Everglades. It also requests that the federal government report to Congress in two years on the base's redevelopment.</p>
        <p>The Corps of Engineers' long-term plan to restore the Everglades would require capturing fresh water and storing it in limestone quarries and aquifers, methods that are untested in that area. Engineers would also remove dikes and barriers at the eastern edge of the Everglades, which abuts with urban Miami, to permit the water to flow into the marshland.</p>
        <p>Eighty percent of the captured water would be used to restore the ecosystem, giving the Everglades half the total expanded water supply. Now farms and cities get 70 percent of a smaller water supply.</p>
        <p>Elliot Diringer, White House deputy press secretary, called the plan ''a replumbing of the replumbing.''</p>
        <p>Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, cast the only vote against the bill.</p>
        <p>For Senator Smith, the Everglades legislation posed his first challenge as chairman of the environment committee. He took over last year, after its former chairman, Senator John H. Chafee, a Republican moderate from Rhode Island, died.</p>
        <p>Since then, environmental groups have expressed profound reservations about Mr. Smith, a hard-line conservative, and his commitment to the environment. But Mr. Smith scored high marks with his handling of the Everglades matter and received much of the credit for cobbling together a bipartisan bill in an election year.</p>
        <p>On the Senate floor today, Mr. Smith shrugged off the calculus of election-year politics, saying he was thrilled to finish what Mr. Chafee had begun.</p>
        <p>''Some say we did bad politics -- bad politics for the administration to work with a Republican Congress, bad politics for Republicans to work with the administration,'' Mr. Smith said. ''They say that Florida is a swing state -- maybe Gov. George Bush will get too much credit, or Al Gore, who has been closely associated with the Everglades, he's going to get too much credit. You know what? There is enough credit to go around. Who cares?''</p>
