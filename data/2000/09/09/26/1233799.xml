        <p>We often talk about people carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders, but never really mean it as much more than a metaphor.</p>
        <p>Tonight in Sydney, we meant it.</p>
        <p>Cathy Freeman, the pride of Australia, the joy of the Aborigine people, carried this continent 400 meters across the finish line and light years farther.</p>
        <p>The 27-year-old Freeman ended a four-year journey in just 49.11 seconds to become the first Aborigine to win an individual Olympic gold medal. The news media coverage was so intense, the adulation so smothering that it had become a threat. A silver medal would have been accepted graciously, but in reality, another second-place finish would be counted as a loss.</p>
        <p>As Freeman ran tonight, all the nerves, all the anticipation, the 112,524 fans screaming and cheering for history, provided the fuel.</p>
        <p>''I was very nervous,'' she said after the race, ''but I heard this voice in my head just telling me to do what I know, do what I know. As long as I did that, I'd be fine.''</p>
        <p>Freeman didn't run the race of her life -- she had run 48.6 seconds, her personal best, in Atlanta. She ran the race of hundreds of thousands of other lives. And she ran with a certain fury, knowing that when she finished -- when she won -- she would be free for the first time in nearly four years, since she finished second to Marie-Jose Perec at the 1996 Games in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Perec left town last week. Under normal circumstances, critics might say the defending champion had robbed the new champion of the joy of snatching her crown. But tonight, after the first of many waves of excitement had washed up and gone away, Freeman gave Perec an eloquent farewell bouquet. Freeman knew her time had come, and Perec's had passed.</p>
        <p>''I was more happy for her because she made the decision,'' Freeman said. ''I know her well enough to know she's a very proud athlete, and I respect her for what she represents.''</p>
        <p>''She decided she wasn't ready to run and she didn't want to run,'' she added. ''The only important thing is that she's happy.''</p>
        <p>Lorraine Graham of Jamaica, the silver medalist, and Katharine Merry of Britain, who won the bronze, were ready to run the race of their lives. Freeman and Graham were even coming out of the final turn. Some will say that the uproar of the Australians carried Freeman to the finish line. In the final 50 meters, Freeman pulled away from Graham and broke the tape. Exhausted and delirious, Freeman began the process of winding down by sitting on the track for two minutes.</p>
        <p>''I could feel the crowd around me, all over me,'' she said. ''I felt everybody's emotion. Happiness and joy absorbed into every pore of my body. I had to sit down to make myself feel normal and get comfortable. It was beyond words.''</p>
        <p>First, she went over to her mother and stepfather. Then, in the most symbolic act of all, Freeman took a victory lap with both the Australian and Aboriginal flags. Finally, she was free.</p>
        <p>Afterward, she said she hoped ''what's happened tonight will make a difference in people's attitudes: to the person walking in the street, their attitude; people in the political arena, their attitude.''</p>
        <p>''All I know is that I've made a lot of people happy, with all kinds of backgrounds who call Australia home,'' Freeman said. ''And I'm happy.''</p>
        <p>The anticipation, emotion and history surrounding Freeman's race was too wide, too high, too vast to be overwhelmed by the news that C. J. Hunter, the 1999 world champion in the shot-put and husband of the sprinter Marion Jones, had tested positive for a banned steroid.</p>
        <p>For this one night, fans and citizens savored a long-awaited treasure; Cathy Freeman savored the moment and said it would not change her.</p>
        <p>''In my simple world, when I wake up in the morning, I have breakfast and I clean my teeth and life's very normal when I'm on my own,'' she said. ''If anything will change, it will be the way everybody treats me.</p>
        <p>''But the main difference within myself will be the fact that I'm pleased that I withstood the pressure and won the gold medal.''</p>
        <p>Many decades from now, when her racing days are long past, she will still have her most valuable possession. Freeman will carry a torch around a stadium the way the former Australian Olympians did before Freeman ignited the caldron in Sydney.</p>
        <p>Someone will remember Sept. 25, 2000. Someone will say then what you can say now without equivocation: Cathy Freeman fought the good fight. She ran the good race.</p>
