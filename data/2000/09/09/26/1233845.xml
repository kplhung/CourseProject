        <p>It is a fabled story in the biotechnology industry. Floyd Nichols, a computer salesman and entrepreneur who had a rare disease that leads to colon cancer, heard of a drug that might save his life. When he could not interest a pharmaceutical company in developing the drug, he formed his own company. And although it was too late for Mr. Nichols -- he died of cancer in 1996 at age 43 -- the drug is now being used experimentally to treat his son, Eric, who also has the disease.</p>
        <p>But the story may not have a happy ending. The company Mr. Nichols started, Cell Pathways, said Friday that it had been told by the Food and Drug Administration that the drug would not be approved.</p>
        <p>The announcement put Cell Pathway's stock into free fall yesterday, with the shares losing two-thirds of their value. The stock closed at $9.31, down $20.69, with 12.8 million shares changing hands.</p>
        <p>Robert W. Towarnicki, president of Cell Pathways, said in a conference call with investors yesterday that the company had not yet received a letter from the F.D.A. outlining the agency's reasons. So he could not say whether the F.D.A. had major objections that would virtually kill the drug or minor ones that would only postpone approval for a short time. The F.D.A., as a rule, does not comment publicly on applications it is considering.</p>
        <p>Cell Pathways, based in Horsham, Pa., was seeking approval to sell the drug, Aptosyn, to treat familial adenomatous polyposis, or FAP, the hereditary disease that Mr. Nichols had. The disease causes hundreds of pre-cancerous growths called polyps to form in the intestine, leading almost invariably to colon cancer.</p>
        <p>But Aptosyn, which can induce precancerous or cancerous cells to destroy themselves, a process known as apoptosis, is also being tested to treat or to prevent several common types of cancer, including colon cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer. Cell Pathways executives said in the conference call that the company would continue with clinical trials for those diseases and that they were encouraged by those trials and by animal studies that seemed to show the drug was effective.</p>
        <p>''The current event is a regulatory event rather than a scientific or medical event,'' said Rifat Pamukcu, the company's co-founder and chief scientific officer, referring to the F.D.A.'s decision.</p>
        <p>Still, if Aptosyn is not approved for FAP, it could take up to three years for Cell Pathways to get a drug on the market, executives said in the conference call. But perhaps the biggest risk for investors is that the problems the F.D.A. has found will also hurt prospects for Aptosyn to be approved for other cancers.</p>
        <p>Cell Pathways suffered a setback in February 1999 when Aptosyn, known generically as exisulind, failed to show a statistically significant difference compared with a placebo in treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis. But the company reanalyzed its data and treated more patients with the drug. It had expected F.D.A. approval to have come by now. Its stock had nearly tripled in the last year before losing virtually all of that gain yesterday.</p>
        <p>Celebrex, the arthritis pill made by the Pharmacia Corporation's Searle division, earlier this year became the first drug approved for FAP. Before that, treatment was basically limited to surgically removing the polyps or the entire colon.</p>
