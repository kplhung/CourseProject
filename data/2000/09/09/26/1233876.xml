        <p>Norilsk Nickel of Russia, the world's biggest palladium producer, sought today to allay growing investor anger over a reorganization plan that minority shareholders call a brazen move to dilute their stakes.</p>
        <p>The company surprised investors last week with the plan, which has already reduced the size of their holdings through a series of new stock issues and purchases that no one outside senior company management had known about.</p>
        <p>Today, Norilsk Nickel pledged that it would take steps to limit the dilution of its shares and tried to persuade investors that the reorganization would ultimately increase the value of their holdings.</p>
        <p>Investors were not convinced. ''They've stolen our wallet and are promising to give most of it back,'' remarked a Moscow-based portfolio manager who holds Norilsk shares. ''But the bottom line is that they've stolen it.''</p>
        <p>The manner in which Norilsk disclosed the reorganization and the angry response from shareholders illustrates one of the most persistent problems in Russia's evolution toward a market-driven economy -- poor corporate governance.</p>
        <p>Although the overall economy is growing for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, serious problems remain at many privatized Russian companies. As they become more profitable and valuable, the problem of corporate control becomes worse, pitting large owners against minority shareholders in bitter property fights. While the leadership under President Vladimir V. Putin is working to reform the legal system, many inconsistencies and loopholes remain.</p>
        <p>''This shows yet again that there is a very high risk for shareholders here,'' said Svetlana Smirnova, a metals analyst at Renaissance Capital, an investment bank here. ''It explains why Norilsk shares are priced at only half their true value. In the West, you wouldn't see half a restructuring carried out without shareholder notification.''</p>
        <p>The central element of the company's restructuring lies in the value of a metals trading company called Norimet, which Norilsk bought in April in exchange for a stake in its most valuable subsidiary. That subsidiary, the Norilsk Mining Company, produces most of Norilsk's revenue and owns all its valuable licenses. Analysts said Norilsk management cheated investors out of a fair price for the stake by assigning too high a value to Norimet, which sells Norilsk's metals on world markets.</p>
        <p>Then in July, the subsidiary issued new shares, further reducing shareholder value.</p>
        <p>As a result, these equity holders, which include Western investment funds, lost more than two-thirds of the subsidiary.</p>
        <p>The company argues that the changes will help make Norilsk more efficient and reduce its tax liabilities.</p>
        <p>''Shareholders will get a smaller piece of a more delicious cake,'' said Aleksandr G. Khloponin, Norilsk's general director, at a news conference today.</p>
        <p>Still, the reorganization plan continues to raise questions. Mr. Khloponin acknowledged today that among Norimet's previous owners was Norilsk's majority shareholder, Interros, indicating that management had given away company value to itself.</p>
        <p>Interros is a financial group, which includes a bank, machinery producer and media companies. It is controlled by Vladimir O. Potanin, a businessman who amassed his fortune during Russia's economic free-for-all in the early 90's. Minority shareholders own about 30 percent of Norilsk, whose share price has fluctuated wildly on the news, falling sharply and rebounding today. Interros owns about 60 percent.</p>
