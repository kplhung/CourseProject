        <p>One of the great things about the music of John Dowland is the degree to which it gives performers control of matters that eventually became a composer's prerogative. In Dowland's songbooks lush vocal harmonies are offered, but the music's flexibility is such that if four or five singers are not available a single singer (or two, or three) could perform the song with the additional harmonies played on the lute, or on viols or even recorders.</p>
        <p>Within 50 years of Dowland's death in 1626, composers were prescribing instrumentation, and less than a century and a half after that, as scoring became fussier, the freedom to add melodic embellishments that composers had enjoyed in Renaissance and Baroque times had virtually vanished as well. Dowland's music has its performing conventions, but compared with Romantic music, it is a free-for-all.</p>

        <p>One of the great things about the music of John Dowland is the degree to which it gives performers control of matters that eventually became a composer's prerogative. In Dowland's songbooks lush vocal harmonies are offered, but the music's flexibility is such that if four or five singers are not available a single singer (or two, or three) could perform the song with the additional harmonies played on the lute, or on viols or even recorders.</p>
        <p>Within 50 years of Dowland's death in 1626, composers were prescribing instrumentation, and less than a century and a half after that, as scoring became fussier, the freedom to add melodic embellishments that composers had enjoyed in Renaissance and Baroque times had virtually vanished as well. Dowland's music has its performing conventions, but compared with Romantic music, it is a free-for-all.</p>
        <p>The Queen's Chamber Band mostly performs Baroque works, and its founder, the harpsichordist Elaine Comparone, has always made the most of the ornamental freedoms that Baroque scores offer. In a way, moving on (or back) to Dowland, as the group did on Wednesday evening at Merkin Concert Hall, was not a tremendous stretch. Ms. Comparone left her harpsichord at home and played instead on the lighter-voiced, more period-proper virginal, and Jerry Willard, the group's lutenist, moved into the spotlight, which is only proper, since the lute was Dowland's instrument.</p>
        <p>Marshall Coid, the countertenor, and Julianne Baird, the soprano, sang duet versions of some of the songs and divided others between them. Their approaches were quite different: Mr. Coid's ornamentation was more adventurous, but Ms. Baird's command of timbral nuance gave her readings more of a dramatic flair.</p>
        <p>A particularly satisfying decision was to weave Dowland's instrumental settings -- or those of his contemporary, Thomas Morley -- into their arrangements. Instead of performing ''If My Complaints'' purely in its song form, the group also offered Dowland's instrumental setting of the same melody, which he published as ''Captain Digorie Piper's Pavan,'' as a kind of instrumental break. To complicate matters, instead of using Dowland's version of the Pavan, Mr. Willard played Morley's variations on it. Similarly, ''Now, Oh Now I Needs Must Part,'' which Ms. Baird and Mr. Coid performed as a dialogue, incorporated Morely's variations on Dowland's ''Frog Galliard.''</p>
        <p>There were moments when a Dowland enthusiast might have quibbled over the group's scoring decisions. Keyboard instruments, after all, are interlopers in Dowland's world, and in songs like ''Come Again'' and ''If My Complaints,'' the combination of virginal and lute seemed unduly thick. All things being equal, it would have made more sense to hire a gamba player to support the lute, and leave the virginal out of it. But all things aren't equal: this is Ms. Comparone's band.</p>
        <p>That said, in several works, Ms. Comparone made a strong case for the virginal. It proved a graceful partner to the lute in ''Lord Willoughby's Welcome Home,'' usually performed as a lute duet. And there was a nice interaction between the instruments in ''Clear or Cloudy'' and ''Time Stands Still.'' In several cases Ms. Comparone left the accompaniment entirely to Mr. Willard (and  vice versa), and they each took solo turns -- Ms. Comparone in settings from the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, and Mr. Willard in a handful of Dowland lute works, most notably a deft account of the Fantasie No. 7.</p>
