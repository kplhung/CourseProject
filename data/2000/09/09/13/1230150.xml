        <p>The changes most in the spotlight at Kennedy International Airport lately have involved a $9 billion redevelopment project at the passenger and cargo operations. But there are also changes under way within the roughly five million square feet of commercial and industrial space that surround the airport, home to dozens of airline support companies, freight forwarders, warehouse companies and distributors.</p>
        <p>That industrial area has a significant new investor: the AMB Property Corporation, a San Francisco-based real estate investment trust that is one of the country's largest owners and operators of industrial real estate.</p>
        <p>AMB has been buying airport industrial space around the country as part of a larger goal to both speed up and make more efficient the distribution of goods from various transportation centers, like airports and seaports. The company, which owns 104,000 square feet of industrial space at Newark International Airport, entered the market at Kennedy when it assembled a portfolio of properties that cover more than 1.2 million square feet, 1.1 million square feet of which was bought in the spring from the Great Neck-based J. A. Green Development Corporation. In late August, AMB hired Cushman &amp; Wakefield of Long Island to manage and lease the properties.</p>
        <p>The properties, encompassing 32 buildings and 6 parking lots, are primarily along Guy R. Brewer and Rockaway Boulevards. According to  Cushman &amp; Wakefield, AMB is now the largest landlord of commercial property at Kennedy.</p>
        <p>Reid J. Berch, an industrial property broker at Cushman &amp; Wakefield's office in Melville, N.Y., said that Kennedy's industrial corridor was now one of the most robust such areas in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Annual asking rents there are $8 to $14 a square foot, he said, while asking rents for office space are $14 to $22 a square foot.  Asking rents in the corridor have risen about 10 percent in the last 18 months, compared with 5 percent for similar space elsewhere in Queens or on Long Island, Mr. Berch said.</p>
        <p>Bruce Freedman, the head of real estate operations at AMB, said that rents within Kennedy's industrial corridor ''have moved up substantially'' in the last year.. He said his company was attracted to the area for a number of reasons that included the continued rapid growth of the air cargo business at Kennedy, as well as the large variety of freight forwarders there.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Freedman added that AMB also liked to invest in areas with sizable barriers to entry by competitors. And because of its location, he said, Kennedy does not have the land that is needed for sizable construction projects, as is available in certain other parts of the country, like Dallas.</p>
        <p>Still, AMB is banking on more than just a narrow field of competitors at Kennedy. Because the properties that AMB bought were in relatively poor condition due to inadequate maintenance, Mr. Freedman said, the company spotted an opportunity to raise standards within Kennedy's industrial market over all. Several buildings, he said, had damaged common areas, rusting exteriors, damaged truck doors and stairway handrails and missing lighting. And that, he added, caused them to post an overall occupancy rate of only about 90 percent, compared with roughly 95 percent for the entire Kennedy industrial area.</p>
        <p>''A lot of what we saw there is not atypical for that market,'' Mr. Freedman said, ''but it's not the way AMB would run a property. We're very concerned with the appearance of space and how we present it.''</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Berch, AMB's property portfolio is a collection of  ''very diverse'' buildings that encompass more than 190 tenants and range from 6,000 square feet to 124,000 square feet. Some of the buildings, he said, stand side by side, and all the buildings are within a mile of one another.</p>
        <p>And while most of the buildings are ground-floor warehouses that have attached second-floor office space, Mr. Berch said, the portfolio also included a three-story office building, as well as the only extensive ground-floor retail space within Kennedy's industrial corridor. Mr. Freedman added that the buildings that his company now owned were built from 1966 to 1996.</p>
        <p>According to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, major tenants at the buildings include Concordia International, a freight forwarder, and Rockwell-Collins, a unit of Rockwell International that makes aircraft electronic systems. The largest tenant, however, is UTi, a California company that provides services like freight forwarding and customs brokering; it leases about 45,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>The building with retail space on the ground floor contains about 11,000 square feet of space. Tenants include a bank, a delicatessen, a pizzeria and a Chinese restaurant.</p>
        <p>Vacant space is tight at AMB's new holdings: Cushman &amp; Wakefield says it has less than 50,000 square feet left to lease. Mr. Berch said that he expected occupancy to reach more than 95 percent soon.</p>
        <p>There were two proposals to build a million more square feet of warehouse, distribution and office space within Kennedy's industrial area in the next 12 to 18 months, Mr. Berch said. Those proposals, he said, await approval from the city and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport.</p>
        <p>Even with the chance of new construction competing with his space, Mr. Berch says he is encouraged. ''I get calls from all around the country looking for facilities here at J.F.K. that we just don't have,'' he said. ''I think the proposed new development will get leased up pretty quickly.''</p>
