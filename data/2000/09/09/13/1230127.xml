        <p>New York City's new police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, has decided to ''clean house'' by removing the highest ranking female officer in the Police Department from her command position in the Bronx, in his view to improve department leadership (news article, Sept. 7).</p>

        <p>It is unfortunate that the murder rate in the Bronx has increased recently. But leadership ability in the Police Department extends to peacekeeping as well as law enforcement, social service as well as crime-fighting. A limited view of leadership can be regressive, both in the present struggle to improve police-community relations and in the struggle to eliminate sexual discrimination in the work force.</p>
