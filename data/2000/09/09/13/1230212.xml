        <p>Joseph T. Smitherman, the former segregationist who has been mayor of Selma, Ala., through 35 of the most restless years in the Deep South, lost his tenth bid for re-election tonight after a newly unified black electorate threw its support to James Perkins Jr., a former computer consultant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perkins, 47, who had run against Mr. Smitherman twice before, will become the first black mayor in the history of Selma, a city of 21,000 famous for its bloody response to the civil rights marches of 1965 that led to the Voting Rights Act.</p>
        <p>Unofficial returns showed that Mr. Perkins won 57 percent of the votes in the runoff election, while Mr. Smitherman won 43 percent. As supporters of Mr. Perkins filled the streets and crossed back and forth over the Edmund Pettus Bridge -- where hundreds of marchers were beaten by sheriff's deputies in 1965 -- Mr. Smitherman ruefully conceded.</p>
        <p>''Well, I put up a pretty damn good fight,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home, ''but the blacks decided they wanted a change, and now they've got one. They brought in all these celebrities to energize the voters, and I didn't think it would work, but I guess it did.''</p>
        <p>Referring to a slogan used repeatedly by his opponents, he added, ''They always said, 'Joe gotta go,' and now Joe gone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smitherman won previous elections by getting most of the white vote and enough black votes to achieve a majority, even though the city has been mostly black for decades. Mr. Perkins was able to assemble black voters into a majority, building on a financial scandal in the mayor's last term and a sense in the city that Mr. Smitherman, who is 70, had served long enough.</p>
        <p>''Many have said and many have felt that this was about James Perkins and Joe Smitherman, and that's not true,'' Mr. Perkins said at a victory rally. ''Many have said it's about black and white. That ain't so. This campaign has been about faith and fear. Faith won this campaign.''</p>
        <p>The turnout was heavy, reflecting the surge in interest in the race since Mr. Perkins forced Mr. Smitherman into a runoff for the first time last month. Several civil rights leaders from around the country came to Selma to support Mr. Perkins.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Smitherman was mayor during the 1965 march, he always said he was a moderate segregationist who played no role in the beatings, an assertion confirmed by many of those who were there. Over the years he acknowledged being ''on the wrong side of history,'' appointing many black department heads and trying to spread city services evenly around the city. He had gradually grown more isolated as the City Council and the County Commission were dominated by black elected officials.</p>
