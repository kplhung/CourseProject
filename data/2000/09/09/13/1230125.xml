        <p>Maybe it never really changed, but the popular music business has unequivocally returned to judging female artists by their pounds of flesh. Yards of young midriff define the female presence in pop, overshadowing not just talent but personality as well. This is sad, not only because it shuts out those with better voices than abs, but also because it makes sexuality dull, as false and uniform as the scent of deodorant.</p>
        <p>It's time for a resurgence of brazen women to recharge the mainstream with some rock 'n' roll oomph. Two senior advisers for this much-needed offensive offered their services on Saturday night in Manhattan, showing how pop's girl androids might free their humanity.</p>

        <p>Maybe it never really changed, but the popular music business has unequivocally returned to judging female artists by their pounds of flesh. Yards of young midriff define the female presence in pop, overshadowing not just talent but personality as well. This is sad, not only because it shuts out those with better voices than abs, but also because it makes sexuality dull, as false and uniform as the scent of deodorant.</p>
        <p>It's time for a resurgence of brazen women to recharge the mainstream with some rock 'n' roll oomph. Two senior advisers for this much-needed offensive offered their services on Saturday night in Manhattan, showing how pop's girl androids might free their humanity.</p>
        <p>Marianne Faithfull, who appeared at the Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College, emerged in 1965 as a mod Britney Spears, an ingenue most valued for her looks. She was a model and a consort to Mick Jagger, playing the girlish ideal. Then in the 1970's she practically destroyed herself with heroin. With the release of her punk-influenced 1979 album, ''Broken English,'' she became a rock phoenix, rising with a new, rugged voice and a genius for music that strips away romantic illusion.</p>
        <p>Koko Taylor, who played at B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, has been a raw-voiced oracle since she rose to fame, also in 1965. She never had conventional beauty to fall back on, vocally or physically. As virtually the only female blues belter competing with the men on the South Side of Chicago, she fit in by cultivating earthiness. Her very existence defied the notion of the ladylike, and she turned that difference into a strength, a sign of her honesty.</p>
        <p>Ms. Faithfull, 54, and Ms. Taylor, 65, have developed their challenging approaches separated by the gaps of race, class and feminine convention. On Saturday, Ms. Faithfull offered her usual anthem, John Lennon's brainy polemic ''Working Class Hero''; Ms. Taylor echoed the sentiment in the far more plain-spoken Willie Dixon stomper, ''Big Boss Man.'' During another of her trademark songs, Ms. Faithfull evoked the conflicts caused by desire by repeating the title word until it became a spell: ''Guilt, guilt, guilt.'' Ms. Taylor worked similar magic with more humor as she finished her version of ''Hound Dog.'' She growled: ''Bowwow! Bowwow!''</p>
        <p>Strip away the bohemian aura enveloping Ms. Faithfull and the raunchy-mama stereotypes that surround Ms. Taylor, however, and the same brave project is revealed. In concert these women risked ugliness to find grace in uneven reality. Their voices are wrenched by use, and they pushed them as hard as they ever have. No matter that their bodies show the mark of time, too; they adorned themselves in sexy clothes and moved with the abandon of women who fully own their own sexuality. It is striking how radical their choice to express themselves unhesitatingly still seems.</p>
        <p>Ms. Faithfull, who has played the gown-clad diva in recent years, exploring the songbook of Brecht and Weill, was in full rocker mode in a filmy flowered shirt with a plunging neckline, trousers and moppy hair. Her salty mood may have been enhanced by the support of a tight, inspiring band, especially Greg Cohen on bass and Smokey Hormel on guitar. At times she plopped into a chair and just observed her band mates soloing; her immersion in the music gave her a break from her diva-fabulous persona.</p>
        <p>She surveyed her rich career, including a few of the songs she recorded in her gamine days, like the Merseybeat charmer ''Come and Stay With Me,'' written by Jackie DeShannon with the help of Jimmy Page. Her smoke-cured voice added depth to the song's sunniness.</p>
        <p>Ms. Faithfull also had fun with material from her current album, ''Vagabond Ways'' (Instinct). ''Incarceration of a Flower Child,'' a Roger Waters song that Pink Floyd never managed to record, is her new showpiece. She fell to her knees to relate this caustic story of a hippie dream gone disastrous, which seemed almost autobiographical. She poured as much into the album's title track, a streetwalker's tale that she wrote with David Courts. Ms. Faithfull has sometimes been overwhelmed by the melodrama her music generates, but this evening she had fun with it, flaunting the jaded humor that lifts her out of the fray.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Faithfull went into her encore, Ms. Taylor was taking the stage in Times Square. She also had a fine band, led by the suave guitarist Vino Louden. Like Ms. Faithfull, she went full speed into songs from a new album, ''Royal Blue,'' (Alligator), and old favorites, including her classics ''I'd Rather Go Blind'' and ''Wang Dang Doodle.''</p>
        <p>Instead of artful irony, Ms. Taylor used party songs like ''Blues Hotel'' to leaven the pain of her confessions. Drenched in sweat, she rode the flow of pain into pleasure into pain that is the blues. Her face showed that changing current, transforming in an instant from a show-biz smile to a fierce mask of concentration.</p>
        <p>Ms. Taylor's powerhouse contralto has not completely survived decades of hard labor. Sometimes she would aim for a note and just a rasp would come out; the effect was like a misfired gun. This made her intention all the more profound. This far from ideal performance was full of a quality female musicians are rarely even allowed to display: the courage to live in the rough.</p>
