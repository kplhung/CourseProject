        <p>THE first taste of the coriander chicken on coconut pancakes from Maya Kaimal's new book, ''Savoring the Spice Coast of India'' (Harper Collins, $27.50), evokes a number of responses.</p>
        <p>Is this Thai? Could it really be Indian?  Certainly, it is like no Indian food found in restaurants here.</p>
        <p>It is proof of how little most Americans still know about Indian cooking. Most of the restaurant food and cookbook recipes in America come from northern India and Bangladesh, where the cuisine is marked by lots of meats, tandoori cooking, flatbreads and mild spices. But such a large country, with widely varied climates and a diverse culture, has many regional variations in its cuisine.</p>
        <p>Which is why Ms. Kaimal's recipes seem exotic. There are egg dishes and crisp pancakes leavened with yeast; coconut chutneys, cucumber salads and brothy curries. Mustard seeds, green chilies, tamarind and curry leaves are used in abundance.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kaimal's spice coast is the shoreline along southern and western India, a region called Kerala. It is warm and humid; as in many tropical cuisines, fish and seafood prevail, as do chilies and spices.</p>
        <p>Hindus, Muslims and Christians coexist in the region, and each group has its own style of cooking, all represented in this book.</p>
        <p>Hindus there, including Ms. Kaimal's family, rely on vegetable curries, rice and legumes. The Syrian Christians are known for appam, or yeast pancakes, steamed fish, fried meats and meat stews. The Muslims'  cuisine is more closely tied to the north, with meat curries scented with garam masala and rice casseroles, incorporating local foods like coconut, tamarind, fish and bananas.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kaimal, who is American and a cookbook author, began by exploring the cooking of her relatives, then spent time with both Syrian Christian and Muslim cooks.</p>
        <p>For coconut pancakes, a Syrian Christian recipe, you begin by softening yeast in water, cooking rice flour in a pan and stirring these together with cream of rice, shredded coconut and sugar.</p>
        <p>A few hours later, coconut milk and salt are added, and the delicate batter is fried. A hot nonstick pan, a very thin spatula and patience are needed.</p>
        <p>Alone, the pancakes are fairly bland but, as Ms. Kaimal points out, they are lovely with other dishes. I served them as a base for coriander chicken, a braised dish seasoned with coriander seed, curry leaves, spices, coconut milk and fresh cilantro.</p>
        <p>The fragrant juices from the chicken soaked into the pancakes, making their nutty flavor come alive and providing a spongy, yeasty bed, much like the Ethiopian bread injera, but with crisp edges.</p>
        <p>Two warm cucumber salads, both Hindu, were interesting. One, with tomatoes, cumin, green chilies, yogurt and mustard seeds, was tangy and richly spiced. Another, with black-eyed peas, coconut milk and green chilies, was less vibrant, but memorable for its novel, gentle flavors.</p>
        <p>Like many of the dishes, they had daunting ingredient lists, yet took little time to prepare.</p>
        <p>A pudding made with almond paste, milk, sugar and cardamom, and thickened with Cream of Wheat struck the perfect balance between childhood pleasure and adult indulgence. It was delicious.</p>
        <p>As a guest served this food noted, each dish did what all good Indian food does: it keeps you wanting a little bit more. And a little bit more we all took.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the book, Ms. Kaimal judiciously lays out how to plan a southern Indian meal. Most include rice, bread, a legume, two vegetable dishes and a meat dish. Altogether, these would feed six. If you make fewer dishes, you won't have enough. I made a pancake, a meat dish and two vegetable dishes for five and it was just right.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kaimal has a strong voice, but it is subdued by a lack of space. This is a slim, tightly edited book -- generally a good thing. As with her food, however, I wanted a little more.</p>
        <p>CORIANDER CHICKEN  Adapted from ''Savoring the Spice Coast of India''  Time: 50 minutes</p>
        <p>1/4 cup vegetable oil  2 cups thinly sliced onion  2 teaspoons minced garlic  2 teaspoons minced ginger  1 teaspoon minced serrano or Thai chili  10 to 12 fresh curry leaves  2 tablespoons ground coriander  1 teaspoon ground black pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon cayenne</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</p>
        <p>1/8 teaspoon cinnamon</p>
        <p>1/8 teaspoon ground cloves</p>
        <p>1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom  1 1/2 teaspoons salt  2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes</p>
        <p>1/2 cup coconut milk</p>
        <p>1/4 cup chopped cilantro, plus additional leaves for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. In a large deep pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Saute onions until edges are nicely browned. Add garlic, ginger, chili and curry leaves and fry for 1 minute.</p>
        <p>2. Stir in coriander, pepper, cayenne, turmeric, cinnamon, clove, cardamom, salt and a few teaspoons of water to prevent spices from sticking. Fry for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.</p>
        <p>3. Add chicken pieces and continue stirring over medium-high heat until the pink color disappears. Add  1/4 cup coconut milk and  1/2 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>4. Add remaining coconut milk and chopped cilantro, bring just to a boil and remove from heat. Check salt. Garnish with cilantro leaves and serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
