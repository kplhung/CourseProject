        <p>Malcolm K. Hughes, a former editor in chief of United Press International, died on Monday in Arlington, Va. He was 66.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes, known as Mike, had stomach cancer, U.P.I. reported.</p>
        <p>Born of British parents in India, he served in the Royal Air Force and was hired by what is now U.P.I. in London as a teletype operator in 1956. He rose through the agency's ranks as a sports writer and editor, becoming executive sports editor in 1973.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes went to Washington as vice president and general manager of U.P.I.'s international division. He was executive vice president and editor in chief from 1984 to 1986, when he resigned in a dispute with U.P.I.'s owners over administration of the financially troubled agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes became an associate director of the American Press Institute in Reston, Va., and retired in 1992 because of ill health.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, Morfydd, known as Nicky; a daughter, Christine Dian of London; a brother; and a sister.</p>
