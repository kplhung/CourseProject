        <p>Before adjourning next month, Congress should approve two of the most important conservation bills in many years. One bill, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, would guarantee $45 billion over 15 years for a range of environmental purposes, including wilderness protection. The other could save the Everglades.</p>
        <p>Both bills have made it through most of the hazardous committee process. Some fear they will not survive a floor vote because the Republicans may not want to give President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore two big election-year victories on the environmental front. In truth, these would be big victories for everyone, Republicans included, not least because several powerful Republican committee chairmen have been crucial to their progress so far. The biggest enemy now is inertia on the part of the Republican leadership.</p>

        <p>Before adjourning next month, Congress should approve two of the most important conservation bills in many years.

The other could save the Everglades.</p>
        <p>Both bills have made it through most of the hazardous committee process. Some fear they will not survive a floor vote because the Republicans may not want to give President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore two big election-year victories on the environmental front. In truth, these would be big victories for everyone, Republicans included, not least because several powerful Republican committee chairmen have been crucial to their progress so far. The biggest enemy now is inertia on the part of the Republican leadership.</p>
        <p>Conservation and reinvestment: The Conservation and Reinvestment Act passed the House in May by a resounding margin. It would authorize nearly $3 billion a year for 15 years to acquire wilderness, restore damaged coastlines and estuaries and protect endangered species. The bill will not impose new taxes. It relies on the same mechanism that has long underwritten the government's main land acquisition program, the Land and Water Conservation Fund -- royalties from offshore oil production.</p>
        <p>The House bill was drafted largely by two members who rarely agree on anything -- California's George Miller, a Democrat and staunch conservationist, and Alaska's Don Young, a Republican who has been fighting environmentalists for most of his career but who, nearing retirement, has done a surprising about-face. Similarly, in the Senate the conservative Frank Murkowski of Alaska and the liberal Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico steered the bill past property rights advocates on Mr. Murkowski's Natural Resources Committee. They also improved it along the way, earmarking more money for coastal restoration.</p>
        <p>The Everglades: In early July, a Senate committee approved a blueprint for the most ambitious restoration project ever attempted in this country. The heart of the project is a vast new system of canals, levees and reservoirs designed to store and deliver Florida's copious rainwater to the Everglades, which is slowly dying for lack of fresh water. This undertaking will cost an estimated $8 billion over 20 years, shared by the federal government and Florida, and will also include land acquisition to provide buffer zones between the Everglades and Florida's expanding coastal cities.</p>
        <p>The bill before Congress authorizes $1 billion for the first wave of projects. Gov. Jeb Bush has already promised $200 million, Florida's share of the first-year costs. The ball is now in Congress's court. The measure that emerged from committee in July, thanks largely to Senator Robert C. Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, is now ready for a floor vote in the Senate.</p>
        <p>But a big push will be needed in the House, where no action has been taken. Fortunately for friends of the Everglades, the key house subcommittee is headed by Sherwood Boehlert, the upstate New Yorker who is one of his party's most committed environmentalists. But a surer route to success may be for the House to proceed directly to a floor vote on the Senate bill.</p>
        <p>Before the end of the session, the appropriations committees in both houses must act so that the actual projects, especially those in the Everglades, can begin to move forward. But the crucial first step is to get the projects authorized. Years of work have gone into these measures. It would be a shame to waste this effort.</p>
