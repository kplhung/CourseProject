        <p>Besides the muddled rivalry, the verbal war, the mutual respect mixed with envy that color nearly every facet of the Jets-Patriots relationship, their meeting Monday night was more about which team would gain the jump on its new course.</p>
        <p>With new head coaches, new coordinators, new assistants, new schemes and new players on both sides, the Jets and the Patriots are in the same boat: to produce while learning on the run, to curb the learning process. To coalesce. To act as one even though the identity and chemistry are still being created.</p>
        <p>Advantage Jets. So far they are better at putting this thing together than the Patriots are.</p>
        <p>That is why the Jets can brag.</p>
        <p>In a rivalry like this one, the winner realizes it has gained a quicker track toward the ultimate goals: a divisional championship, a playoff berth and Super Bowl possibilities. The loser is confronted with the nagging notion that the other guys are better at pulling the package together. Better at the free-agent game, the draft, the preparation, the desire, the performance. Better at the entire game. For the 2-0 Jets, it is an exhilarating feeling. For the Patriots (0-2), it hurts. It is exhausting.</p>
        <p>The effects of Monday night's game -- Jets 20, Patriots 19, a thriller, a shocker, a high-strung victory -- can be lasting. The Jets now enjoy a wonderful opportunity to propel themselves toward something great. Their confidence is soaring. The Patriots, however, are full of questions and doubt and are forced to shake a mountain of the wrong momentum.</p>
        <p>The Jets are in excellent shape to continue their trend, playing at home against Buffalo next and then traveling to Tampa Bay where, against Keyshawn Johnson, they can stare down another old ghost and prepare for a remarkable ride.</p>
        <p>The Patriots -- at home next against Minnesota followed by road games at Miami and Denver and then home again against Indianapolis -- have all of the makings for an 0-6 start before seeing the Jets again Oct. 15. Losing this game that they should have won could very well spiral the Patriots into a mental and physical funk.</p>
        <p>The Jets and the Patriots are two franchises that scrutinize and compare each others' every move. Let's make some comparisons.</p>
        <p>THE COACHES -- Al Groh's start is as good as two opening victories get. Close victories. Fourth-quarter victories. They indicate resolve in adversity and that his message and leadership are clear.</p>
        <p>Groh talks a good game. His handling of questions regarding the Bill Parcells-Bill Belichick relationship before the Patriots game was smooth. He complimented them both and kept the focus on the opportunity for his team and for himself. In two games he and his staff have made enough of the right moves -- especially in the waning moments -- to begin to distinguish Groh.</p>
        <p>Bill Belichick saw his team fight itself as much as Tampa Bay in an opening loss at home and then lose a 19-7 fourth-quarter lead Monday night. After playing much of the game in press coverage and throwing the Jets' offense out of sync, the Patriots' defense could not keep pace when the Jets opted for an empty backfield and for running back Richie Anderson spread wide as a receiver. That exposed the Patriots' weakness of too few cover guys at linebacker, and the Patriots failed to respond with a solution such as a safety covering Anderson instead of linebackers. Of the Jets' touchdown drives of 85 yards and 72 yards, the latter was comical: a two-play drive.</p>
        <p>Belichick has to be alarmed that the strength of his team and his game -- defense -- did not win versus the Jets when called upon. When your team's strength becomes its liability, you are in trouble. Belichick has plenty to correct, but how he handles the mental state of his team now will determine the season.</p>
        <p>THE QUARTERBACKS -- Vinny Testaverde is 14-2 as the Jets' starter. He struggled all night against the Patriots but then when they backed off, he took control. He showed experience and determination. To make the kind of game-ending throws he did under that kind of pressure shows that Testaverde is not only back from a season lost because of injury but that he remains one of the game's top five quarterbacks.</p>
        <p>Drew Bledsoe has been sacked 12 times in two games (six sacks in each game). On his last play of the game against the Jets, he was sacked. His team traveled six times inside the Jets' 20-yard line and gained only one touchdown. His mobility is being questioned, but the bottom line with Bledsoe is pass protection. With it, he can flourish. Without it, he cannot improvise.</p>
        <p>THE RECEIVERS -- With no pass protection, Patriots receiver Terry Glenn, so talented, is becoming a nonentity.</p>
        <p>But Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward in two games are on their way to answering the Keyshawn question. Do the Jets have a go-to receiver without Keyshawn? Chrebet and Ward are answering yes and yes. Their plays in the winning touchdown drives were far from routine. Ward's one-handed, 44-yard catch and Chrebet's two scoring catches that showed athleticism and concentration were Pro Bowl-like plays.</p>
        <p>Neither receiver has grabbed a microphone or pounded his chest and proclaimed why he could take over for Johnson. Both, instead, took the high road, walked and spoke softly, and let performance speak loudly.</p>
        <p>Analysis across the nation and locally about both players crept toward them (too small, too little, not good enough even as a duo to replace Keyshawn). Both used the Monday night football platform to give America and their peers a response. That is impressive in production, personality and style.</p>
        <p>The Patriots look toward the long haul. They know that the coming, rugged divisional games for both teams could change everything. They know that the season is a 16-game foray determined by what you have, what you do with it and with how much heart. Their stories are unfolding. But two games in, the Jets have barrels more of what the Patriots desire.</p>
        <p>Confidence. Promise.</p>
