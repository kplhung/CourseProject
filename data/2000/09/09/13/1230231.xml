        <p>With their preparation time dwindling and concern mounting, the United States Olympic basketball teams vacated the men's and women's team hotel in Melbourne yesterday and arrived in Sydney Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The teams left their Melbourne hotel at 6:30 a.m. on Tuesday, the day after a protest against a World Economic Forum meeting in the same building affected their practice schedules.</p>
        <p>The men were restricted to a workout in the hotel gym and to watching game videotapes because about 1,500 demonstrators packed the streets outside. Skirmishes between the police and the demonstrators made it difficult for anyone to enter or leave the hotel.</p>
        <p>Members of the women's team walked past the protesters after a 75-minute wait on Monday and practiced without incident. But more than a hour later on Monday, when the men were supposed to leave the hotel for practice, more protesters had joined the scene and made it difficult for buses to get around.</p>
        <p>''There were no concerns over safety,'' said Craig Miller, a USA Basketball spokesman. ''The issue involved finalizing our preparation and getting on a more predictable schedule with three or four days left before the Olympics. Getting into Sydney early was probably the best option for us.''</p>
        <p>The women's team was not scheduled to leave Melbourne until the today, while the men were scheduled to arrive in Sydney on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''At this point we're so close to the Games the main issue is just trying to keep a schedule,'' Miller said. Both American teams were scheduled to have their first practices in Sydney today.</p>
        <p>Chinese Admit Failed Tests</p>
        <p>The biggest drug scandal in Chinese sports just got bigger.</p>
        <p>After a week of saying that injuries, illness and poor performance were involved in some cases, Chinese officials said Tuesday in Sydney that nearly all of the 27 athletes cut from the Olympic team failed drug tests.</p>
        <p>He Huixian, the Chinese Olympic Committee's spokeswoman, said ''the overwhelming majority'' had suspicious results in blood tests for the performance-enhancing drug EPO.</p>
        <p>Among them were six runners trained by the famed coach Ma Junren, whose record-smashing ''Ma's Army'' stunned the world in the 1990's. The spokeswoman said Ma was responsible for his runners' failed tests, ''that is without doubt.''</p>
        <p>Ma and his runners were among the most conspicuous absentees in the squad that is expected to produce 16 gold medals for China, matching its total in Atlanta four years ago. China cut its squad for Sydney from 311 to 284 competitors.</p>
        <p>He, the spokeswoman, also said that China was not the only offender.</p>
        <p>''EPO has polluted the world sports stage,'' she said in an interview. ''Many countries know that they have athletes using EPO, including America, Australia, Germany, England, France -- they all know. It's a global problem.''</p>
        <p>Chinese sports have been riddled with drug scandals in recent years, but none involving so many people in one series of tests. In addition to the athletes, the Chinese cut 13 coaches including Ma from their squad.</p>
        <p>The strongest Chinese hopes for medals are in diving, weight lifting, table tennis and badminton.</p>
        <p>By leaving home those athletes who failed drug tests, Chinese sports officials may have improved Beijing's bid for the 2008 Olympics and avoided a repeat of embarrassing doping scandals at the 1994 Asian Games and 1998 swimming world championships.</p>
        <p>''I'm very pleased,'' the International Olympic Committee president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, said at the time of the drug-related withdrawals. ''I'm very happy. This is very good news. It shows the new system for detecting doping substances will work very well. The objective is to have clean games.''</p>
        <p>Of Ma's athletes, only the 10,000-meter runner Li Ji remained on the team. Spared any cuts or embarrassment was China's weight-lifting team, which is expected to win at least five gold medals, including four women's titles. (AP)</p>
