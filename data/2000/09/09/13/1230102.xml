        <p>GRAND SICHUAN INTERNATIONAL in Chelsea not only prepares excellent and authentic Sichuan food but also goes to extraordinary lengths to explain the cuisine's finer points to Americans. Now, it has opened a branch uptown in Clinton, which is great news for lovers of Chinese food.</p>
        <p>The owners, John Zhang and Quan Jun Lee, who is also the chef, have recreated the extensive menu of the Chelsea branch while adding dishes based on a popular Chinese television series. They have also brought with them a fascinating 26-page guide to Chinese regional cuisines.</p>
        <p>While the menu includes Cantonese and Shanghai sections, the specialties are the Sichuan and Hunan dishes, and the new TV dishes, which are described in a supplement. If you have time to scan the booklet before you order -- not easy, given the attentive, eager-to-please waiters -- you are likely to find inspiration.</p>
        <p>I did. The new dishes, all with poetic names and created for an emperor, include Growing Grass in Spring Must Be Like Green and Threaded Silk ($5.95), a mixture of fresh sliced vegetables served cold in a fiery yet flavorful sauce, which sets the mouth aglow and demands well-timed mouthfuls of rice and water. Another dish, Green Parrot With a Red Mouth ($4.95), cooked spinach served cool with a sauce of ginger and hot oil, is more refreshing than spicy with a gingery kick.</p>
        <p>Chili heat is often present in Sichuan dishes, but not always. Sliced conch with wild pepper sauce ($6.95), made with Sichuan peppercorns, offers a thoroughly different sensation in which the pepper sets the mouth atingle, as if the food were dancing across the tongue. It is a perfect foil for the chewy conch. More familiar dishes include excellent renditions of Sichuan cold noodles ($3.95), with a slight sweetness, which offsets the growing heat; delicate wontons stuffed with pork and served in a spicy red oil ($3.95); and fiery dan dan noodles ($3.95).</p>
        <p>Pork is a preferred meat of Sichuan and Hunan, and Grand Sichuan states authoritatively that the Chinese prefer fatty cuts to lean. Braised pork with chestnuts ($9.55), a marvelous combination of savory pork and crunchy chestnuts, may test a Westerner's tolerance for such cuts. Lard-phobes will find it easier to accept the less fatty double-cooked pork ($8.95) and cured pork with garlic shoots ($9.55), made with pungent garlic greens that taste far milder than they smell.</p>
        <p>I loved sour string beans with minced pork ($8.95), a Hunan dish in which sweet diced beans are pickled rather than sour. Ma po tofu, bean curd with spicy minced pork and chili peppers ($8.25), is a classic Sichuan dish, invented, the guide explains, by an old woman with a face pockmarked by measles.</p>
        <p>Nonpork highlights include crisp, tender quail ($12.95), subtly flavored with five-spice powder, and simple but flavorful sauteed greens ($7.95).</p>
        <p>With glittery chandeliers, walls of marble and wood, and at least four sources of light, the dining room has the aesthetic appeal of a generic hotel lobby. But in all the ways that count, Grand Sichuan stands out.</p>
