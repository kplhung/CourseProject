        <p>The Chase Manhattan Corporation, the third-biggest banking company in the United States, is expected to announce today that it has agreed to acquire J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, one of the most storied banks, for $30.9 billion in stock, executives close to the talks said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Chase has been striving to transform itself into a global financial powerhouse, and acquiring Morgan could sharply accelerate the process. Since the early 1980's, Morgan has changed from a commercial bank with a blue-chip list of clients into a firm focused on investment banking.</p>
        <p>Buying Morgan could catapult Chase into the big leagues of investment banking, the business of raising money for large corporations and advising them on mergers and acquisitions. It would also continue the consolidation among the nation's largest banks, leaving only a handful of huge institutions at the top of the industry. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>Together, Chase and Morgan would have more than $650 billion in assets, ranking second to Citigroup's $800 billion.</p>
        <p>''This is the deal that should have been done a year ago,'' said Michael Mayo, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''It's a logical progression.''</p>
        <p>While the companies have released no details on the likely deal, executives close to the negotiations said that job cuts were expected. Some analysts speculated that several thousand jobs could be eliminated.</p>
        <p>Most of Chase's banking customers would probably not notice much immediate change as a result of the combination. Most of the overlap between the two companies would be in investment banking functions, like underwriting stocks and bonds and trading currencies.</p>
        <p>Chase is one of the biggest creditcard issuers in the country and a major lender to individuals seeking to buy houses and cars. In contrast, even as it has labored to reinvent itself, Morgan has continued to focus largely on serving the needs of blue-chip clients, both corporate and individual. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>Still, both have struggled to keep pace with the rapid growth of the leading investment banks, which are in businesses that have been far more lucrative than the lending business at the core of commercial banking.</p>
        <p>''The resulting organization would clearly be powerful because both firms are both bank and investment bank,'' said Robert Albertson, president of Pilot Financial, an investment firm in New York. ''The old Chase and the old Morgan a decade ago would have been oil and water, but now they're made of the same liquid. They've grown closer rather than further apart.''</p>
        <p>The new firm would be called J. P. Morgan Chase, the executives said. William B. Harrison, chairman and chief executive of Chase, would be chief executive of the combined institution. Douglas A. Warner III, chairman and president of Morgan, would be chairman of J. P. Morgan Chase.</p>
        <p>Chase agreed to exchange 3.7 shares of its stock for each of Morgan's 159 million shares, the executives said. At Chase's closing stock price of $52.50 yesterday, the proposed price was about $30.9 billion.</p>
        <p>Chase has total assets of $396 billion, compared with $266 billion for Morgan. While both companies are among the five biggest banks in the nation, neither has been able to crack the top tier of investment banks. Chase ranks 9th and Morgan 10th this year among advisers to corporations on mergers and acquisitions around the world.</p>
        <p>Chase has operations in 65 countries and nearly 80,000 employees. J. P. Morgan has about 16,000 employees.</p>
        <p>The deal, if completed, would end months of speculation about who might acquire the 150-year-old Morgan. Several firms, including Deutsche Bank of Germany, have recently considered buying Morgan as consolidation has picked up speed on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>In the last few months, there have been several high-priced acquisitions of midsize American financial companies, including the PaineWebber Group, the brokerage firm, and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, a midsize investment bank. The commercial banking industry has been consolidating as well. But none of those deals involved two companeis with the heritage and power of Chase and Morgan.</p>
        <p>Chase, which was founded in 1799, has grown rapidly in recent years through mergers with some of New York's biggest banks, including Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover. More recently, it has been buying up smaller investment banking firms. To strengthen its position as an underwriter of technology companies, it acquired Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a San Francisco-based firm, last year.</p>
        <p>This spring it bought the Beacon Group, a merger boutique run by Geoff Boisi, a former investment banker at the Goldman Sachs Group who is now overseeing Chase's investment banking operations. In June, Chase added Robert Fleming Holdings, an investment banking and money-management firm in Europe, for $7.7 billion.</p>
        <p>But even with those purchases, Chase faced the prospect of losing ground as competitors made even bigger acquisitions. UBS, the giant Swiss bank, agreed to pay more than $12 billion to buy PaineWebber earlier this year. Last month, the Credit Suisse Group, another Swiss bank, agreed to pay about $12.8 billion to buy Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette from AXA, a French financial conglomerate.</p>
        <p>Those deals nearly wiped out the ranks of independent middle-tier securities firms, increasing the pressure on would-be buyers to rush in. At the beginning of this week, only three remained: Morgan, Lehman Brothers Holdings and Bear Stearns.</p>
        <p>For its part, Morgan has worked for years to transform itself into a company focused on investment banking but has stayed away from mergers and major acquisitions. But according to one adviser who had talked with J. P. Morgan, Mr. Warner has been shopping the company to prospective buyers for several months. That person said that Morgan was asking for a premium of 15 percent to 20 percent over the current stock price, a sum some investment banks thought was too rich.</p>
        <p>Of particular concern was J. P. Morgan's fixed-income trading business, which competitors say made up too much of its business.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Bank was one suitor interested in J. P. Morgan, but that bank would have to register shares here before it could complete any transaction, and that would take more than a year.</p>
        <p>Late last week, Morgan's chief financial officer, Peter Hancock, quit suddenly, adding more fuel to the speculation. Then, Tuesday morning, Mr. Warner, the chairman of Morgan, set the rumors flying when he canceled an appearance at a banking conference sponsored by Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>Morgan's stock shot up $16.13, to $185.44, yesterday. Chase's shares fell $4.88, to $52.50.</p>
