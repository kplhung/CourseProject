        <p>COMPARED with some of California's better-known wine regions, the Anderson Valley doesn't get much attention, except when it's mistaken for the Alexander Valley. The Alexander, in northern Sonoma County, is home to many big wineries like Clos du Bois and Jordan. Anderson Valley, in Mendocino County, is roughly the same size as the Alexander but with far fewer grapes planted, and it is home mostly to small, little-known wineries that deserve a higher profile.</p>
        <p>Pinot noir in particular grows successfully in the Anderson's cool climate, but the valley may also be California's best area for German grapes like gewurztraminer and riesling. Chardonnay and zinfandel also do well.</p>

        <p>COMPARED with some of California's better-known wine regions, the Anderson Valley doesn't get much attention, except when it's mistaken for the Alexander Valley. The Alexander, in northern Sonoma County, is home to many big wineries like Clos du Bois and Jordan. Anderson Valley, in Mendocino County, is roughly the same size as the Alexander but with far fewer grapes planted, and it is home mostly to small, little-known wineries that deserve a higher profile.</p>
        <p>Pinot noir in particular grows successfully in the Anderson's cool climate, but the valley may also be California's best area for German grapes like gewurztraminer and riesling. Chardonnay and zinfandel also do well.</p>
        <p>You'll have to work to find Anderson Valley wines. Navarro Vineyards, perhaps the area's leading winery, doesn't sell its wines retail. You can often find the wines on good restaurant lists, though. Navarro makes superb rieslings and gewurztraminers, both dry and sweet, and a fine chardonnay.</p>
        <p>Handley Cellars is a little easier to find in stores than Navarro. It, too, makes a fine gewurztraminer, along with a juicy pinot noir. Edmeades Vineyards, a winery owned by Kendall-Jackson, makes small lots of wine, including a terrific pinot noir.</p>
        <p>Several wineries outside the area buy the valley's grapes. Au Bon Climat in Santa Barbara County makes a fine though pricey pinot noir under its Ici/La-Bas label, while Littorai, a small winery in Napa Valley, makes several Anderson Valley wines.</p>
        <p>The one giant among the Anderson elves is Roederer Estate, the California arm of the French Champagne house. Its sparkling wine is one of America's best.</p>
        <p>EDMEADES, PINOT NOIR 1997 $20.  Rich, fruity aroma; smooth and medium-bodied with herbal and chocolate flavors.</p>
        <p>HANDLEY, PINOT NOIR, ESTATE RESERVE 1995 $31.  Big and mouth-filling, with berry, mint and leather flavors.</p>
        <p>ICI/LA-BAS, PINOT NOIR, LES REVELES , ELKE VINEYARD 1997 $58.</p>
        <p>Fresh, fruity aroma, silky textured, rich and complex.</p>
        <p>LITTORAI, PINOT NOIR, SAVOY VINEYARD 1997 $35.  Sweet, complex and voluptuous.</p>
        <p>NAVARRO WHITE RIESLING, CLUSTER SELECT, LATE HARVEST,  VERY SWEET 1997; 375 MILLILITERS  $25.  Rich, sweet and honeyed, yet spicy and balanced.</p>
        <p>ROEDERER ESTATE, BRUT, NV $19.  Citrus aromas, tangy, bright and delicious.</p>
        <p>Listed in alphabetical order. Prices are those paid in various Manhattan wine shops.</p>
