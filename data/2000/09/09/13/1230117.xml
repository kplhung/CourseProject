        <p>FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA marked his 25th anniversary in the wine business on Saturday with a daylong party at his Niebaum-Coppola Winery here. The festivities included a dinner with vintages of his prestigious Rubicon red wine dating back to 1978, served in magnums, followed by a screening of his film ''One From the Heart.''</p>
        <p>For me and a group of other guests, the highlight of the day was a tasting comparing California and Bordeaux cabernet sauvignon blends from the 1985 and 1995 vintages. Led by Niebaum-Coppola's winemaker, Scott McLeod, we tasted 1985 Bordeaux from Chateaux Lynch-Bages, Pichon-Lalande, Leoville-Las Cases, Haut Brion, Margaux and Lafite-Rothschild. From the Napa Valley, the 85's were Heitz Cellars Martha's Vineyard, Neibaum-Coppola Estate Winery's Rubicon, Joseph Phelps's Insignia, Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23, Chateau Montelena Cabernet Sauvignon and Robert Mondavi Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon.</p>
        <p>The 1995 wines were the same except for the Heitz. Like most Napa Valley wineries, the Heitz Cellars vineyards were seriously damaged by phylloxera in the late 1980's and replanted in 1992. Another Heitz estate wine, Trailside Vineyard, took its place.</p>
        <p>The first flight of wines in the tasting on Saturday morning consisted of the dozen 85's, all identified, with the six California wines in one row and the Bordeaux wines in another. In the second flight, the wines were served blind.</p>
        <p>To me, the remarkable feature of the tasting was the change in style among the French wines. The 1985's offered no surprises. There were some excellent wines, all true to form. They were elegant and restrained; the California wines were full-bodied and lush. The French were more angular and austere; the Californians more rounded and mellow.</p>
        <p>Ten years later, all that had changed. The French wines had become, well, more Californian. Mr. McLeod asked the group -- winemakers, a couple of restaurant people, a few journalists and one prominent filmmaker -- to guess which 1995's were Californian and which were French. Only one person got them all correct. I got 5 wrong out of 12, but then I've always considered humiliation an important component of wine judging.</p>
        <p>My favorites among the 1985's were Lynch-Bages, Margaux and the Cask 23. Among the the 1995's, I liked the Chateau Montelena, the Phelps Insignia and the Leoville-Las Cases.</p>
        <p>At the dinner, I especially enjoyed the 1978, 1981 and 1984 Rubicons.</p>
        <p>Both 1985 and 1995 were fine vintages in Bordeaux and California. The 1985 Bordeaux were early maturing and lacked something of the power and concentration of 1989 and 1990. And yet they seemed, on Saturday anyway, harder and less generous than the Napa wines.</p>
        <p>In California, 1985 is thought to have been the best year of the decade. Both the Bordeaux and California wines matured fairly early. As for the 1995's, most critics rated the Bordeaux just below the more tannic 1996's and the California wines just below the 1994's but above the 1996's, all three being excellent years.</p>
        <p>Bordeaux and the Napa Valley, and particularly Niebaum-Coppola, are inextricably intertwined. Bordeaux has always been the inspiration for Napa cabernets, and both regions use the same grapes. Gustave Niebaum, who founded the estate in the late 1800's, used Bordeaux cuttings to start his vineyard and, as Mr. Coppola noted before the tasting, ''We still plant the Niebaum clone of cabernet sauvignon today.'' In fact, Niebaum-Coppola's Rubicon was one of the first ultrapremium California wines to be made from a blend of Bordeaux varieties.</p>
        <p>An earlier generation of Napa Valley vintners boasted that their best wines were 100 percent cabernet. Now most winemakers agree that the best wines in California, as in Bordeaux, are blends. Among the 1985's, the Rubicon is 61 percent cabernet sauvignon, 26 percent cabernet franc and 13 percent merlot; the Phelps Insignia is 60 percent cabernet sauvignon, 15 percent cabernet franc and 25 percent merlot. There are, of course, traditionalists. The Heitz Martha's Vineyard 1985, like all previous Martha's Vineyards, is 100 percent cabernet sauvignon.</p>
        <p>The Bordeaux winemakers have always blended and have never bothered to explain their blends. Among the wines in Saturday's tasting, Lafite-Rothschild usually has 70 percent cabernet sauvignon, 25 percent merlot and small amounts of cabernet franc and petit verdot. Lynch-Bages and Margaux are similar.</p>
        <p>After the tasting someone observed that when experts identify Bordeaux wines as Californian and Californian wines as Bordeaux, the days of comparing one region with another may be ending; that the convergence of styles, so evident in the tasting, may mark the beginning of a time when we will compare California estates with Bordeaux chateaus -- with no regional bias.</p>
        <p>''The world is a smaller place,'' Mr. McLeod said, leaving no doubt that he feels California will occupy the premier position. ''We are entering a golden age here. The first decade of the new millennium may well belong to the Napa Valley.''</p>
