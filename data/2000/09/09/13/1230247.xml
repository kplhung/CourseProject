        <p>BRONX: RAPIST SOUGHT  The police are looking for a masked rapist who climbs in women's windows and attacks them at knifepoint. The rapist has struck three times, most recently yesterday, in the Morris Heights section, the police said. The same man is also suspected in a fourth incident in which he burst into a woman's apartment, threw a bottle at her and fled, said Officer Guy Brown, a police spokesman. The three rape victims were 21, 23 and 23 years old, Officer Brown said. The rapist also threatens to hurt the victims' children if they do not submit to him, said Capt. Geryl McCarthy.

        <p>MANHATTAN: SENTENCE IN THEFT OF MALCOLM X DIARY  The law clerk charged with stealing Malcolm X's diary from an evidence safe and selling it to a curio dealer was sentenced yesterday to five years of probation, a $5,000 fine and 150 hours of community service. Justice Jeffrey Atlas of State Supreme Court also ordered the clerk, Douglas Henderson, 42, to stay away from Malcolm X's family. Mr. Henderson, a clerk in the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building, interrupted his trial in July and pleaded guilty to third-degree grand larceny in exchange for a deal that kept him out of jail.</p>

        <p>WASHINGTON: DEALING WITH BIOLOGICAL TERRORISM  A Federal General Accounting Office report on the New York region's response to the West Nile virus has concluded that government agencies are unprepared to deal with biological terrorism, Senator Charles E. Schumer said yesterday. Mr. Schumer vowed to ask Congress next year to double the $250 million now spent to combat biological terrorism.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: BUS AND FIRE TRUCK COLLIDE  A transit bus and a fire truck collided at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street yesterday morning, injuring six firefighters, the bus driver and 10 passengers, officials said. The M2 bus, operated by the Metropolitan Transit Authority, was traveling south on Fifth Avenue, when it was struck by a New York City Fire Department ladder truck heading west on 57th Street. Firefighter Mike Pendergast, a department spokesman, said the truck was one of several that had responded to a high-rise fire at Broadway and 55th Street.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: FIRE ON FERRY  A fire broke out yesterday on a high-speed commuter ferry linking Manhattan and Highlands, N.J., as it was mooring at South Street Seaport, officials said. The crew of the ferry, which is operated by SeaStreak America, had secured the bow line when smoke began billowing from the fan room, which draws hot air from the engine room, said Petty Officer Angel Patti of the Coast Guard. All 75 people aboard were evacuated safely. Firefighters from Engine Company 15 across the street worked with the crew to extinguish the fire.</p>

        <p>SLOATSBURG: 'SMART' BUSES ROLL OUT  Three buses that automatically announce stops to passengers began operating in Rockland County this week. The buses, which run from Sloatsburg to the Nanuet Mall, are programmed to say ''The next stop is . . .'' in English and Spanish. The buses are equipped with satellite-based global positioning systems that automatically determine the next stop, and announce it to passengers ahead of time. The system is to be installed on the county's entire fleet of 40 buses by January.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: SUBWAY BEATING  A woman from the Bronx who is accused of beating a teenager on the Canal Street subway platform on Sept. 5 was ordered held on $25,000 bail yesterday, a day after turning herself in, officials said. The woman, Stepanie Ducker, 21, is charged with knocking down the victim, 19, then smashing her head against the concrete floor at least twice, said Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office. Ms. Thompson said the victim, who had rebuffed Ms. Ducker and fellow break dancers who were asking for money, was hospitalized.</p>

        <p>ATLANTIC CITY: ARREST IN TRIPLE HOMICIDE  A casino security guard was arrested yesterday and charged in a roadside attack with an assault rifle that left three people dead last week. The guard, Lloyd Massey II, 21, surrendered yesterday. Mr. Massey got into an argument with Michael Demps, 20, of Pleasantville at a bar in Egg Harbor Township on Friday, the authorities said. When Mr. Demps left, in a car with three other men, Mr. Massey and a friend followed them into Atlantic City. At a red light, Mr. Massey jumped out and opened fire on the other car's occupants. The two victims beside Mr. Demps were Lamont Wilson, 21, and Richard White, 26, both of Pleasantville.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: JOBLESS RATE UP IN AUGUST  New Jersey's unemployment rate rose to 4 percent in August, up from 3.7 percent in July, the State Labor Department announced yesterday. The number of private sector jobs grew by 2,000, but 2,800 temporary government employees lost their jobs because of completion of the census. A department spokesman pointed out that the state unemployment rate was still lower than the August national average of 4.1 percent.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: JET ENGINE FAILURES INVESTIGATED  The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating three engine failures on Continental Airlines jets since April, including two at Newark International Airport, the airline's hub. All three incidents occurred on DC-10 wide-body jets scheduled for retirement within two years, and involved damage to engines made by General Electric. All occurred before takeoff, and none resulted in injuries. A General Electric spokesman said the three incidents involved a loose exhaust valve that damaged the engine casing, and were the first such problems for 1,400 CF-6 engines now in use.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>NEW HAVEN: ONE JUDGE FOR MALL SUITS  To ease the increasing legal load a $500 million mall proposal has put on the state court system, the state has designated a single Superior Court judge to hear most of the complaints, a court spokeswoman said. In the last two years, the mall's proponents, including New Haven city officials, and opponents, including Westfield America, a company that owns four malls in the state, have filed at least 16 lawsuits and legal petitions about the center, known as the Galleria at Long Wharf. Since July, most of the suits have been referred to Judge Beverly J. Hodgson of the court's Complex Litigation Docket in Waterbury.</p>
