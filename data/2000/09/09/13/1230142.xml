        <p>As Britain approached the new millennium, the centerpiece of its efforts to draw the eyes of the world to a cool Britannia was the Millennium Dome -- a huge tent beside the Thames River shaped like an inverted wok and packed with exhibits.</p>
        <p>Cool is hardly the term for it now.</p>
        <p>In the nine months since the dome was opened at Greenwich in east London, it has become a sore embarrassment for Prime Minister Tony Blair's government, depicted less often as a dome than as a sinkhole for seemingly endless subsidies from the National Lottery that have pushed its cost to the public beyond $1 billion.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the cruelest cut came today when a British division of the Nomura Securities Company of Japan pulled the plug on a $157 million bid to take over the financially ailing edifice at the end of this year, when the New Millennium Experience Company's one-year contract to operate the dome expires.</p>
        <p>The problem, primarily, was that despite the hoopla surrounding its opening at New Year's, too many Britons and other potential visitors stayed away.</p>
        <p>Initially, the New Millennium Experience Company, a government-led agency that operates the dome, forecast that it would be a financial success, with 12 million visitors in a year. That forecast was lowered to 7 million, but by the end of the summer vacation season, no more than 4.7 million had passed through its portals, according to a spokeswoman for the company. And even those figures are questionable. By some estimates, the final count for the whole year will not exceed 4.5 million.</p>
        <p>A Nomura-led consortium called Dome Europe had promised a $1.2 billion investment to turn the dome and its surrounding land into a leisure and entertainment park.</p>
        <p>By today, it was not low attendance but the dome's ramshackle finances that caused the problem. Only weeks after the newest, $74 million injection of lottery money -- the fifth in a year -- Nomura called into question the dome's financial management, saying that there was ''substantial uncertainty'' about the assets controlled by the New Millennium Experience Company.</p>
        <p>Nomura said it had been denied access to full financial information about its would-be acquisition. ''This was a very difficult decision to make,'' said Guy Hands, the brokerage firm's financing chief in Britain, ''but in the circumstances we had no alternative.''</p>
        <p>Nomura won a bidding competition for the dome in July, beating out Legacy P.L.C., a consortium that had promised a major investment to turn it into a center for high-technology business start-ups. Legacy said today it was still interested in buying the dome, and government officials said Legacy's bid might be revived.</p>
        <p>For all that, the dome has become a political symbol here. Britons critical of Mr. Blair complain that his government has been more interested in salvaging hurt pride than in spending public money for the public good. The government minister responsible for the dome, Lord Falconer, has rejected what have become routine calls for his resignation, saying it is his duty to remain until the end of the year.</p>
        <p>After the latest injection of lottery money, David James, a new chairman with a reputation for repairing troubled companies, was appointed to sort out the dome's financial problems and keep it open until it could be handed over to Nomura. Shortly after his appointment, Mr. James said the dome's operators had not even compiled a register of its assets.</p>
        <p>An earlier audit by PriceWaterhouseCoopers disclosed what Mr. Hands of Nomura said was ''new information about the costs and future liabilities of the dome,'' suggesting that its finances had been run haphazardly. The ownership of some of its assets was also unclear.</p>
        <p>The dome's operators said today that the exhibits would remain open until the end of the year under the same management. From 2,000 to 3,000 jobs in the depressed area around the dome would be in jeopardy if it was shut down.</p>
