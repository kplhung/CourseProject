        <p>For the first time since World War II, a synagogue opened its doors today in the vicinty of the Auschwitz death camp, and was hailed as a symbol of the healing of the long troubled relationship between Poles and Jews.</p>
        <p>In front of the small synagogue, ransacked by the Nazis and later used as a carpet warehouse under Poland's postwar Communists, Jewish officials, Polish ministers and even a Jordanian prince gathered to hear messages of reconciliation, including a call from President Clinton to act with ''principle and purpose'' on the lessons of the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>But the atmosphere of good will was clouded slightly by the fact that the synagogue's opening came a few weeks after that of a large disco, which stands about a mile closer to the camp.</p>
        <p>Jewish organizations, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, have protested that the disco, ''in the immediate vicinity of the largest Jewish graveyard in history,'' amounts to an affront, but local authorities have said they can do little because the dance club is on private property, a mile from the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex.</p>
        <p>The difficulties appeared to capture the tensions between the desires of the living, particularly Polish youth, and the shadow of the dead, including more than a million murdered Jews, in a provincial Polish town stained forever by what the Nazis did nearby.</p>
        <p>''It is better, and normal, that young people go and dance than that they make trouble,'' said Klaudia Zaor, an 18-year-old student. ''Sometimes we have the impression that the Jews just want this town to die.''</p>
        <p>As she spoke, she watched, with an amused twinkle in her green eyes, as the ceremony at the synagogue proceded. Speaker after speaker referred to a restoration of life. The sun shone with a late-summer glow on the newly painted cream-yellow walls of the refurbished building, the only place of Jewish worship not entirely destroyed by the Nazi onslaught in 1939 on the town of Oswiecim -- the Polish name for Auschwitz.</p>
        <p>It was this modest southwestern Polish town, whose Jewish minority  numbered 7,000 in 1939, that gave the German version of its name to the adjacent camp.</p>
        <p>Not one Jew now lives in Oswiecim -- the last survivor died in May. But the synagogue will serve as a place of prayer and reflection for Jewish visitors to the camp. No rabbi is to be permanently attached to the synagogue, so any formal services must be organized in advance.</p>
        <p>The past post-Communist decade has brought a modest Jewish revival in Poland and Fred Schwartz, the New York businessman who raised $3 million for the new synagogue, said he backed the building in part because ''the ashes at the camp communicated nothing of the life that  had been here.''</p>
        <p>His initiative was repeatedly applauded by more than a hundred people at a three-hour ceremony today. The United States ambassador, Christopher Hill, read a letter from President Clinton that said the synagogue would serve ''as a place for contemplation where future generations can reflect on the world they lost.''</p>
        <p>A letter from Poland's prime minister, Jerzy Buzek, was read by the chief of the Polish Chancellery, Maciej Musial. In notably stark language, Mr. Buzek said that Jews had been ''sentenced to be burned at the stake by the Nazis,'' but that the attempt at annihilation had failed and the synagogue showed that ''those who save traditions save a culture.''</p>
        <p>Relations between Poles and Jews have proved difficult in the postwar years, but the difficulties have come a long way toward resolution in recent years, and the ceremony today included an emotional speech by the local bishop and an equally warm evocation of Polish-Jewish relations by Marek Siwiec, the national security adviser to the Polish president.</p>
        <p>Saying that the dignity of the victims of the Holocaust had always remained intact, but ''our own dignity'' needed to be restored, Bishop Tadeusz Rakoczy praised the synagogue as a place of ''meeting and hope.'' He concluded with a simple greeting: ''Shalom.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Siwiec said the synagogue, flanked by a cultural center filled with photographs of the town's prewar Jewish life, was a ''symbol of the links between Poles and Jews.''</p>
        <p>But some problems remain. The furor over the disco, situated in a former tannery where camp inmates worked and died, follows conflicts over crosses erected outside Auschwitz to commemorate Catholic victims and over a Carmelite convent. All but one of the crosses -- the largest -- have now been removed; the convent closed in 1993.</p>
        <p>The government denounced the disco last week, saying that ''amusement places should not be located at areas marked with the suffering of the inmates of former death and concentration camps.'' But it also said it could not order the club's closing because ''the disco and the land under it are both private property.''</p>
        <p>Rafal Waliczek, the club's owner, has argued that it lies well beyond the 100-yard-deep zone around the camp in which all commercial activity is banned and that his premises are not the original tannery, as most historians contend, but a factory erected in 1952.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Jozef Krawczyk, the town's mayor, met representatives of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which has demanded the disco's immediate closing, and said the town needed money from international organizations or the government to compensate Mr. Waliczek and buy out the building. He said he was confident the problem would be solved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krawczyk avoided any reference to the controversy in a speech today that focused on reconciliation. He was followed by Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, the brother of the late King Hussein, who made an impassioned plea for people of all religions to ''make a commitment to our common humanity.''</p>
        <p>He was profusely thanked by Shevach Weiss, the chairman of the Yad Vashem Memorial in Jerusalem, who said the prince's presence was a moving ''symbol of the continuity of making peace, of solidarity in its pursuit, and of understanding of what happened before.''</p>
