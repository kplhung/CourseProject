        <p>He had his passion for playing baseball criticized by the blustery principal owner of the Yankees, so he barked back. He has been bothered by so many elbow, wrist and forearm injuries that he could do a cameo on ''E.R.'' He had such a terrible defensive game one night in June that the manager mercifully suggested he leave Yankee Stadium before the contest was even over.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch has already endured a torturous and tumultuous season, a season unlike any in his 10-year career. Knoblauch's chronic throwing problems have not disappeared as much as they have been tempered by his lack of playing time at second base. His next throw could aggravate the tendinitis in his right elbow, the ball could flutter like a Frisbee and cause George Steinbrenner to screech again, or it could be accurate. It has been that perplexing for Knoblauch.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees understand the importance of having a competent Knoblauch leading off as they prepare for another postseason, and that was underscored in their 10-2 victory over the Blue Jays last night at the Stadium. Knoblauch stroked a critical two-run triple off Joey Hamilton in the second inning that gave Denny Neagle an early cushion and helped him win his fourth straight start.</p>
        <p>David Cone will return to the starting rotation after dislocating his left shoulder eight days ago, but Neagle's emergence has almost certainly made Cone's return Friday an audition for the bullpen in October. Neagle (7-4) pitched splendidly and received a standing ovation after allowing two runs while whiffing seven in seven and two-thirds innings. Still, even Neagle lauded Knoblauch.</p>
        <p>''That's patented Knoblauch tonight,'' Neagle said. ''We all know what he can do for us. I know his elbow is still sore, but he's playing through the pain. He is going to get even better, and that's going to make us stronger.''</p>
        <p>With Knoblauch providing the spark, Neagle providing the pitching and Jose Canseco providing the power with three hits and three runs batted in, the Yanks began a 10-day period in which they will play the Blue Jays six times and the Indians four times. The Yankees lead the American League East by eight games over the Red Sox, but they will influence the wild-card race.</p>
        <p>As the Yankees prepared for a run at their third straight World Series title, Manager Joe Torre will continue tweaking them until he believes they are ready. Torre needs relievers Mike Stanton and Jeff Nelson to be sharper, and he needs the rotation to stay effective. The piece that has been missing for over a month is Knoblauch's tenacity atop the lineup. That is why Knoblauch's simple contributions last night loomed large.</p>
        <p>''We traded for him and won two World Series with him,'' Torre said. ''That tells you how important he is.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch, who had been sidelined since Aug. 3, returned to the lineup on Sept. 6. It was less than a week after Steinbrenner inferred that Knoblauch was hesitant to return because of his throwing woes.</p>
        <p>Gradually, Knoblauch is looking more as if he is really back. He walked on four pitches in his first at-bat against the wobbly Hamilton. With the Yankees up, 2-1, with two outs and runners on second and third in the second, Knoblauch flicked a liner to right. Chad Mottola should have let it drop for a single, but he dived awkwardly, flailed at a ball that bounced five feet in front of him and had it slither by him for a triple. It was just Knoblauch's second hit in 19 at-bats since he was activated.</p>
        <p>''When he gets going on offense,'' Tino Martinez said, ''he's a pain to the other team.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch also ranged about 30 feet to his left to make a nice stop and a strong off-balance throw in the fourth. But Torre still replaced him with Jose Vizcaino to start the seventh, saying, ''That's what we do here.''</p>
        <p>Canseco belted a two-run shot into the left-field seats to make the score 6-1 in the fourth, pausing briefly after he hit it to stare at his bat and make sure it was not cracked. Like Knoblauch, Canseco is another piece the Yankees need but have not had all season. Like Knoblauch, Canseco's body is still healing after a long stint on the disabled list. There is a different feeling when Canseco bats at the Stadium, and the fans booed as he was intentionally walked in the seventh. Ryan Thompson followed with a three-run double.</p>
        <p>Despite a 6-1 lead in the fifth, Neagle encountered a ticklish situation when Toronto loaded the bases with no outs. After Alex Gonzalez singled in the second run, Mottola hit a pop down the right-field line. Martinez scooted toward the stands, but the wind pushed the ball into fair territory and Martinez had to deftly lunge to his left to snare it.</p>
        <p>Still, Neagle could not exhale. Carlos Delgado, the favorite to win the most valuable player award and a Triple Crown candidate, was the next batter. Delgado smacked a hard grounder to Martinez, who flipped the ball to Derek Jeter, who then tossed it back to Neagle covering first for a nifty and timely double play.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>BERNIE WILLIAMS is recuperating from a strained right rib-cage muscle and a strained right calf muscle, which he injured while running on Sunday. ''The only positive about this is none of these are season-ending injuries,'' said Williams, who hopes to play tomorrow.</p>
