        <p>Pack a Wallop, Hold the Sugar  Maureen McGovern  Oak Room at the Algonquin</p>
        <p>It takes a special combination of qualities for a singer nowadays to be able to carry off the big inspirational ballads of Rodgers and Hammerstein without seeming either too saccharine or too grandiose, since these Broadway warhorses already tend to push the envelope of sentimentality. But Maureen McGovern, whose newest cabaret show, a tribute to Richard Rodgers, opened at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel on Friday evening, is one of the few singers with the sensibility and vocal capacity to put them over.</p>

        <p>Pack a Wallop, Hold the Sugar  Maureen McGovern  Oak Room at the Algonquin</p>
        <p>It takes a special combination of qualities for a singer nowadays to be able to carry off the big inspirational ballads of Rodgers and Hammerstein without seeming either too saccharine or too grandiose, since these Broadway warhorses already tend to push the envelope of sentimentality. But Maureen McGovern, whose newest cabaret show, a tribute to Richard Rodgers, opened at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel on Friday evening, is one of the few singers with the sensibility and vocal capacity to put them over.</p>
        <p>Her show, which plays through Oct. 14, divides Rodgers's catalog into thematic blocks, concentrating more on his collaborations with Lorenz Hart at the beginning (one segment examines Hart's attempts to circumvent direct expressions of romantic love), then turning attention to his work with Oscar Hammerstein II. A segment demonstrating Rodgers's fondness for waltzes includes an amusing description of Jeanette MacDonald, the so-called iron butterfly, singing ''Lover'' while astride a horse.</p>
        <p>In another high point Ms. McGovern, accompanied on piano by Jeff Harris, adopts a chilly English accent to deliver ''To Keep My Love Alive,'' Rodgers and Hart's word-perfect comic monologue of an upwardly mobile serial murderess. Her versions of ''It Never Entered My Mind,'' ''This Nearly Was Mine'' and ''You've Got to Be Taught'' (wound  around a fragment of Stephen Sondheim's ''Children Will Listen'') find an ideal balance between clarity and a wistful lyricism.</p>
        <p>It all builds to a medley of Rodgers and Hammerstein songs exalting hope and perseverance that begins with ''A Cockeyed Optimist'' and culminates with ''Climb Ev'ry Mountain'' and ''You'll Never Walk Alone.'' Here the secret is restraint. Ms. McGovern's beautiful semi-operatic voice, perfect enunciation and innate sense of propriety prevent her from turning the songs into gushy showcases for a phony show business empathy. In allowing the songs to breathe, she brings them to emotional life.</p>
        <p>Those Are the Breaks; Might As Well Live  Jackie Cain and Roy Kral  Firebird Cafe</p>
        <p>The lyricist Fran Landesman, who wrote the words for three songs in Jackie Cain and Roy Kral's smart new cabaret act, has always specialized in mocking despair by adopting a tone of fey whimsy that suggests Dorothy Parker with her claws retracted. Four decades ago Ms. Landesman collaborated with Tommy Wolf on the cult nightclub standards ''Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most'' and ''The Ballad of the Sad Young Men,'' and she's still in fine form. Her collaborations with Mr. Kral are the high points of the pop-jazz duo's new show, which plays Thursdays through Saturdays at the Firebird Cafe through Sept. 23.</p>
        <p>The narrator of ''Lost,'' which Ms. Cain delivers with a shrug-your-shoulders insouciance, muses about losing her keys, tickets and other small items before lowering the boom and naming other forfeitures, including ''my memory and my looks'' and ''my castle and my king.'' Ms. Cain brings a similar lighthearted stoicism to ''Absent Friends,'' an equally devastating song about reaching the age when your friends are dying off. ''Through the Windows of Cars'' evokes the feeling of detachedly looking back on your own life as a jumble of images rushing outside a window.</p>
        <p>All three might be called senior songs. Sung by Ms. Cain and with Mr. Kral on the piano, they address some hard facts without a trace of self-pity. Thursday's opening show found Ms. Cain and Mr. Kral, who are in their 70's, bravely coping with their own losses, which include an increasingly shaky vocal blend. But rhythmically, the duo, who were accompanied by Dean Johnson on bass and Rich De Rosa on drums, still swing, as they proved with punchy upbeat versions of ''I Got Rhythm'' and ''Come Fly With Me.'' And their genteel jazz format of genial scat vocal improvisations folded into carefully blocked pop settings is as durable as ever.</p>
