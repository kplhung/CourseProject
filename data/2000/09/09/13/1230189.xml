        <p>Offering a moral victory but no immediate cash, the Federal Election Commission today upheld Patrick J. Buchanan's claim to $12.6 million in disputed federal campaign funds earmarked for the Reform Party's presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>In an ''initial determination'' of a heated Reform Party dispute, the commission voted 5 to 1 that Mr. Buchanan is the legitimate nominee and entitled to the money. But the actual awarding of the funds from the treasury must await the commission's final determination at some later date, with a federal court fight threatened after that.</p>
        <p>The commission rejected the rival claim of John Hagelin, an Iowa physicist who was nominated by a Reform faction that staged a walkout at the party convention last month rather than take part in Mr. Buchanan's nomination.</p>
        <p>The Buchanan camp hailed the  decision by the commission and signaled Mr. Buchanan's emphatic return to the national campaign after a month's recuperation for gall bladder surgery. He is to deliver an address on Monday at Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C. The Bob Jones campus became an issue for the Republicans during the primaries when Gov. George W. Bush of Texas spoke there, despite critics' complaints that the university banned interracial dating and had a history of anti-Catholicism.</p>
        <p>''We're in pretty good shape, as long as the money comes in this week,'' said Bay Buchanan, the sister and campaign strategist of the candidate, who bolted the Republican Party last October when his presidential quest flagged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan, the fiery conservative polemicist whose standing has plummeted to 1 percent in recent national opinion polls, has been bedeviled by the challenge of the Hagelin faction. Mr. Hagelin has already said he will try to continue the challenge to Mr. Buchanan's legitimacy beyond the commission with a federal court suit.</p>
        <p>In the remaining eight weeks of the campaign, Mr. Buchanan has said his goal is to tap into the federal financing to begin television advertisements and to win his own court fight to gain entry into the televised presidential debates.</p>
        <p>The commission, which meets again on Thursday, set no date for its final determination, Ian Stirton, a spokesman, said. A petition from an anti-Buchanan faction in New York remains to be dealt with before the final determination.</p>
        <p>The petition includes an affidavit from Ross Perot, the founder of the Reform Party, siding with Mr. Hagelin as ''the only proper candidate to receive public funding, based on the votes I received in the 1996 election.''</p>
        <p>The commission majority found otherwise in its initial determination,  after investigating the extent of the rivals' support in state Reform organizations.</p>
        <p>''There is no doubt here that Buchanan is the party's nominee, and there is no reason to delay the certification,'' said Bradley Smith, a commission member.</p>
        <p>The one dissenting commissioner, Karl Sandstrom, insisted that the decision was hasty and should be left for the courts to settle. ''The law requires more of us than of officials at a track meet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The commission's final determination, which could be made within days, then would be followed by its certification to the treasury that the money can flow to the Buchanan campaign's cash-starved coffers. Whether Mr. Hagelin can block this through the courts remains an open question.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan has been sorely counting on the federal funds, which come from taxpayers' nonpartisan voluntary check-off on federal income tax returns. The amount of money is calculated using the 8 percent share of the vote won by Mr. Perot in the 1996 election.</p>
        <p>''We can now move forward with our campaign and go after Al Gore and George W. Bush and take our issues to the American public,'' declared Tim Haley, Mr. Buchanan's campaign manager.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan contends that the drawn-out challenge to his candidacy's legitimacy, which includes continuing ballot challenges in state courts, is ultimately being financed by Mr. Perot. But Russell Varney, a Perot associate, declared, ''That is not true, and Buchanan knows it.''</p>
