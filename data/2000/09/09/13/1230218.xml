        <p>Ford and Firestone, partners for a century, fell into bitter sniping before a Senate committee today, with top executives trading accusations about how the companies should divide responsibility for the dozens of deaths in rollover crashes involving Ford Explorers and Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>The hearing was ''like tying two cats by the tail and throwing them over the clothesline and letting them claw each other,'' said Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat.</p>
        <p>Each company has been seeking to put blame upon the other since early August, when Firestone recalled 6.5 million tires because of deadly failures on some sport utility vehicles, mostly Explorers. But today's hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee showed how profound the rift between the two automotive pioneers had become.</p>
        <p>Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, faulted the way John Lampe, Firestone's executive vice president, and others had handled warranty claims and other evidence of a problem. Mr. Nasser said that when he attended a House subcommittee hearing last Wednesday on tires: ''I listened in disbelief as senior Firestone executives not only acknowledged that Firestone had analyzed its claims data, but also identified significant patterns of tread separations as early as 1998. Yet Firestone said nothing to anyone, including Ford Motor Company.''</p>
        <p>Ford was also unhappy with Firestone's estimate that it would take well into next year to replace all the tires being recalled, Mr. Nasser said. ''We went berserk when we heard that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The head of the American subsidiary of the Japanese-owned tire company, Masatoshi Ono, made a brief opening statement, saying he took ''full and personal responsibility'' for the events that led to the hearing. But he also said his limited command of English had reduced the company's ability to get its points across.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampe, however, sought to focus attention on the design of the Explorer. He said that there had been 16,000 Explorer rollovers and that ''tire failure was involved in only a very, very small portion'' of them. His written testimony put it at less than 10 percent. In remarks to reporters later, he said that the stability of the Explorer would have to be analyzed as ''part of the puzzle'' of the crashes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampe also said that the company might have found the source of the flaw that made some of its tires throw off their treads. The company now believed that the problem involved a ''unique design specification'' of the tires, combined with human error and machine problems at the company's Decatur, Ill., factory, he said.</p>
        <p>In his remarks to reporters after the hearing, Mr. Lampe said he would not be specific because the problem involved a trade secret, saying only that the bad tires had resulted from ''an aspect of the design combined with a process variability.'' The design feature involved a belt, he added.</p>
        <p>Firestone is bringing in an expert from the University of California at Berkeley to evaluate the hypothesis, he said.</p>
        <p>Much of the testimony today focused on the federal highway safety agency and what even top transportation officials acknowledge is its ineffectiveness in spotting and monitoring safety problems like the tire flaw. The secretary of transportation and his subordinate, the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, asked for powers to compel tire and auto companies to turn over data on quality.</p>
        <p>But they acknowledged that they lacked the ability to pick up safety trends from the varied sources of information they already had. For example, they receive complaints from consumers, reports on fatal accidents and information from insurers, but have trouble linking them to expose serious problems.</p>
        <p>The safety official, Sue Bailey dodged a question from Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, when he asked her how the agency would evaluate information ''qualitatively,'' looking at the significance of reports of problems rather than their number. Dr. Bailey, a doctor of osteopathy, referred to Senator Frist, who is a surgeon, as a ''fellow scientist'' and said that a mathematical system was needed to determine when an issue reached a threshold at which investigation was required.</p>
        <p>Members of the committee repeatedly asked if the highway agency needed more money to analyze safety trends.</p>
        <p>''Never once has any of you come to me and said, 'Look, we've got to increase this budget; be our advocate here,' '' the chairman, John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said pointedly to Dr. Bailey and Rodney Slater, the transportation secretary. The two witnesses agreed with him, but said they were planning to take $1.8 million from other safety programs and spend it on investigating Firestone tires. They did not specify what programs would be cut.</p>
        <p>Mr. Slater said his department wanted the authority to require auto- makers and related companies to report on foreign recalls. But he acknowledged under questioning that the information could also be obtained from foreign governments, though the United States does not normally trade information with highway safety regulators in other countries.</p>
        <p>The reason, he said, is a lack of a protocol by which governments could swap proprietary information without fear of public release.</p>
        <p>Senator Hollings expressed surprise that commercial attaches in American embassies in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Malaysia, three countries where Ford replaced Firestone tires on Explorers, had not informed the highway safety agency. Dr. Bailey said that if her office had known of those actions, combined with the trouble reports here, there would have been an investigation sooner. Instead, the tip-off for the federal government came from consumer complaints generated by news reports from a Houston television station, KHOU, she said.</p>
        <p>Several committee members voiced enthusiasm for giving the highway agency greater powers to demand information, including data on services provided under warranty, which is the type of data that Ford eventually used to expose the problem with Firestone tires. Several also called for enacting criminal penalties for companies that failed to report safety problems, a position even Ford and Firestone endorsed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampe of Firestone said that in hindsight his company had not looked at its own data properly. He added that the root of the problem might be Ford's recommendation to inflate the tires on Explorers to a relatively low range of 26 to 30 pounds.</p>
        <p>Firestone approved that range when the large, heavy vehicle first went on the market a decade ago. But looking back, he said, Firestone should probably have considered that more carefully, because under-inflated tires heat up rapidly and heat can cause damage. Consumers also often run their tires at pressures lower than what is recommended, he said.</p>
        <p>Several committee members also favored raising or eliminating the ceiling on fines to companies for failing to turn over information. Joan Claybrook, a former administrator of the highway safety agency and now president of Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy organization founded by Ralph Nader, derided the existing limits as ''a joke.'' The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is one of the few such federal agencies with no criminal statutes to back it up.</p>
