        <p>Indonesia's defense minister said today that his government would not meet with United Nations representatives when they visit Indonesia to look into the killings of three United Nations refugee workers in West Timor last week.</p>
        <p>The minister, Mohammed Mafud, told journalists in Jakarta that the cabinet considered the incident an internal matter. The delegation, which is being sent by the Security Council, was expected to leave early next week.</p>
        <p>''We will reject the presence of that mission,'' Mr. Mafud said, according to the news agency Agence France-Presse. ''We will negotiate on our own, we will settle this on our own, a sovereign nation.''</p>
        <p>But President Abdurrahman Wahid said the minister had gone beyond his instructions, diplomats reported in New York. They said Indonesia's foreign minister, Alwi Abdurrahman Shihab, would convey his government's formal response on Wednesday morning.</p>
        <p>Richard C. Holbrooke, the United States representative at the United Nations, predicted that the visit would go ahead. The visit's purpose, he said in a telephone interview, was not to embarrass the government but to offer help by directly expressing the Council's concerns. ''This mission is to support the civilian leadership of Indonesia,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The three workers for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -- Carlos Caceres-Collazo of Puerto Rico, Samson Aregehegn of Ethiopia and Pero Simundza of Croatia -- were killed in Atambua, in West Timor, when a mob led by armed militia members stormed their office and battered and hacked them to death. The workers were unarmed. The attackers had been attending a funeral for a militia leader killed the day before.</p>
        <p>Today the national police chief, Gen. Rusdihardjo, reported in Jakarta that five suspects had been arrested in the investigation into the death of the militia leader, Olivio Medonca, known as Moruk.</p>
        <p>The Security Council, in a resolution on Friday, demanded that the Indonesian government take immediate steps to disarm and disband the undisciplined militias, which oppose independence for East Timor and are thought to get support from elements in the Indonesian military.</p>
        <p>The three United Nations workers were in West Timor to assist refugees who fled militia predations in East Timor. The Council said United Nations workers, more than 400 of whom were evacuated from West Timor after the killings, would not return until the government showed that could guarantee their security.</p>
