        <p>Some of the artists were born in the United States. Others were from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico (before it became a territory in 1898) and across Latin America. But over 200 years, all created art that reflected their cultural traditions.

        <p>NEWS</p>
        <p>From the New World</p>
        <p>Some of the artists were born in the United States. Others were from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico (before it became a territory in 1898) and across Latin America. But over 200 years, all created art that reflected their cultural traditions. These are the artists represented by the 66 paintings, sculptures and photographs to be displayed beginning on Saturday in ''Arte Latino: Treasures From the Smithsonian Art Museum.'' The  exhibition, a sampling of the Smithsonian's 500 works, is at the El Paso Museum of Art in Texas through Nov. 12.</p>
        <p>Off and Running</p>
        <p>With Zdenek Macal conducting and the Russian-born violinist Maxim Vengerov as guest soloist, the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra ushers in its 78th season with a concert at 7 p.m. tomorrow in Prudential Hall at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark. On a program that includes the New Jersey premiere of Richard Danielpour's ''Toward the Splendid City'' and Respighi's ''Pines of Rome,'' Mr. Vengerov will perform Beethoven's Violin Concerto in D major.</p>
        <p>Laughter and Music</p>
        <p>Steve Martin, Mary Tyler Moore, Jerry Seinfeld and Dick Van Dyke are among the comedians who are to take part in the salute to Carl Reiner when he receives the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center in Washington on Oct. 24. Other participants include Richard Belzer, George Wallace and Rob Reiner, Carl's son. . . . A Brazilian impresario said he was lining up 98 musical acts, including Britney Spears, 'N Sync and R.E.M. for a rock concert in Rio de Janeiro in January. The impresario, Roberto Medina, said ''Rock in Rio for a Better World,'' a benefit expected to draw more than 2 million people, would be the biggest musical event ever.</p>
        <p>Bluesman's Due</p>
        <p>Legend has it that he sold his soul to the Devil at a crossroad at midnight in return for his prowess as a musician. His name was Robert Johnson. What is undeniable is that  Mississippi-born Johnson (1891-1938) was a great bluesman whose powerful, precise guitar playing influenced his contemporaries and others. At 8 p.m. tomorrow at Merkin Concert Hall, his legacy will be explored and illuminated in ''At the Crossroads: A Tribute to Robert Johnson.'' Participants include the former Captain Beefheart guitarist Gary Lucas, the British folk guitarist John Renbourn and the singer and songwriter Toshi Reagon.</p>
