        <p>The presidential race may be neck and neck, but there is one place Gov. George W. Bush has cut back on his campaigning. The rear of his own plane.</p>
        <p>Until a few days ago, the Republican nominee would stroll the aisle of the campaign's chartered Boeing 757 to chat with reporters traveling with him. But the visits became fewer and farther between after Mr. Bush's aides found that the networks preferred those informal moments to the staged events of the day. And reporters, in turn, began to object when the campaign insisted that the governor's conversations at 30,000 feet had to be off the record.</p>
        <p>''We discovered they were using shots from the plane on the evening news,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director. ''And because Gore wasn't doing 'avails' like that, the networks were using shots from his events.''</p>
        <p>After months of romancing the media, the Bush campaign is learning about the downside of courtship. Unlike the campaign of Vice President Al Gore, which has strictly limited the candidate's access, Mr. Bush and his advisers have provided a steady diet of the kind of ''availabilities'' that reporters crave.</p>
        <p>Even on days that he can anticipate tough encounters -- as on the morning last week when articles appeared quoting prominent Republicans expressing worries about the state of the Bush campaign -- the governor met with reporters.</p>
        <p>''He took questions for 20 minutes,'' said Walter Shapiro, a columnist for USA Today, ''and the consensus of the reporters I talked to was that this was a gutsy performance.''</p>
        <p>In providing the access, Mr. Bush's aides have also learned how piercing the double-edged sword can be, for making the governor available almost every day has given reporters and camera crews a greater degree of autonomy within the highly controlled confines of a presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, by contrast, was for weeks this summer virtually unavailable for daily questions from reporters, a practice that may have irritated the media, but certainly gave him tighter control over the ideas and images the campaign sought to convey.</p>
        <p>As the experience of the photo opportunities on the Bush plane demonstrated, access does not guarantee cooperative coverage. In fact, Mr. Bush appears at times to grant the media license to knock him completely off his message.</p>
        <p>When, for instance, Mr. Bush surprised the media last month with an admission aboard the campaign plane that he had to do a better job of  making clear his plan for a tax cut, some reporters used his candor as the foundation for stories about a campaign in disarray.</p>
        <p>The pattern continued today, as Mr. Bush appeared on the tarmac of Orlando International Airport and faced several questions about a report in The New York Times that the word ''rats'' shows up for a split second in an anti-Gore commercial by the Republican National Committee.</p>
        <p>CNN led its midafternoon newscast today with its follow-up to the report. ''No detail is too small or too fleeting to cause a controversy,'' a CNN anchor noted. In its piece about Mr. Bush's tarmac appearance, the network also pointed out that Mr. Bush mispronounced ''subliminal'' four times.</p>
        <p>Nelson Warfield, who served as Bob Dole's press secretary during the 1996 presidential campaign, said: ''Another day of message lost for a guy in a neck-and-neck race. The Bush campaign is a highly disciplined operation, and I think they are convinced their message will penetrate. He doesn't want to become a bumbler and he isn't yet. But this is not a helpful thing.''</p>
        <p>In what sometimes can sound like an echo of his former rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, the governor often speaks of his respect for reporters as if he genuinely likes them. In a question-and-answer session Mr. Bush held with workers at a high-technology company in Warrendale, Pa., on Friday, the first two questioners were critical of what they saw as the way the press distorted Mr. Bush's campaign themes.</p>
        <p>''There's an interesting relationship between me and the media,'' Mr. Bush told the employees at the company, Marconi Communications. ''I need them to get my message out, and sometimes it comes out fairly and sometimes, frankly, I don't care for the coverage. But that's O.K. Sometimes I answer the question, they think its O.K. Sometimes I answer the questions, they don't like it.''</p>
        <p>Today, it was Mr. Bush and his staff who did not like the questions. As the plane headed to St. Louis, Ms. Hughes served reporters cubes of cheese as she called the article about the rats reference ''the cheesiest story'' she had ever read.</p>
        <p>For the first time since his loss in the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Bush has had to endure a sustained period of bad news, reported by many of the people he says he respects. The recent events range in significance from his failed effort to impose his own plan for debates to smaller gaffes and strategic miscues that have become frequent distractions.</p>
        <p>The campaign and the reporters who follow it say there has been no perceptible deterioration in their relationship. Indeed, some in the traveling press corps report a kind of admiration for Mr. Bush's resilience.</p>
        <p>''He can get pummeled by reporters,'' said David Gregory, a correspondent for NBC News assigned to the campaign. ''And 10 minutes later, he'll come back and shake hands.''</p>
        <p>Still, some political professionals wonder whether the trouble Mr. Bush has faced recently will force a shift in the relationship between the governor and the journalists.</p>
        <p>''The press is the most jealous mistress of all,'' Mr. Warfield said. ''And Bush has been very smart in recognizing the demands of the care and feeding of the press. The question is how he continues that, now that he's hit a rough patch.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Warfield said that Mr. Dole, who as a senator was known for his quick wit, found the tenor of the coverage in the presidential race frustrating. ''He enjoyed bantering with reporters, but his dry sense of humor didn't always translate into ink,'' Mr. Warfield explained.</p>
        <p>In one instance, Mr. Dole was asked the fairly innocuous question, What was the one thing he wanted Americans to know about him?, Mr. Warfield recalled. ''Senator Dole sort of scratched his head and said 'Beats me,' in a funny way.'' The resulting story? ''Dole can't come up with a single thing he wants America to know about him.''</p>
        <p>''There came a certain reluctance to step on your message of the day by taking the high risk of shooting the breeze with reporters,'' Mr. Warfield said.</p>
        <p>Some reporters following Mr. Bush say that on some days, the themes and issues the campaign emphasizes, especially health care and education, are retreads that force them to pursue other story lines. And ever more often, the story of the day is what the latest polls are saying.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's decision to visit this state, previously thought to be safely in his column, itself became the dominant story on Monday, when the governor was in Clearwater and West Palm Beach, talking about health care. For example, the lead paragraph in The Palm Beach Post's front page story on Mr. Bush's noted that Mr. Bush's campaign here was ''nowhere near the sure thing he hoped it would be.''</p>
        <p>Whether all the ''avails'' are to any avail may be incalculable. Much of what happens is beyond the control of a campaign anyway, said Mr. Shapiro of USA Today, who traveled with the campaign last week.</p>
        <p>''A drop in the polls is something that nothing can cushion,'' he said. ''An embarrassing admission is something that nothing can cushion. So all these things are at the margins.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Shapiro said he thought the campaign and the press had reached an acceptable equilibrium.</p>
        <p>''It's not chummy 'We're all in this together' nor is it 'You're all part of an evil media conspiracy,' '' Mr. Shapiro said. ''It's much more 'You have your job to do, and we'll help you.' Anything closer, you'd get suspicious.''</p>
