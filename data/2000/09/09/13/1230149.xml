        <p>I've known Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman for years. They are smart, capable men who have a pretty good handle on what makes our economy tick.

        <p>I've known Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman for years. They are smart, capable men who have a pretty good handle on what makes our economy tick. But judging from their comments in recent days, I'm a bit bewildered. In his speeches, Mr. Gore attacked ''big oil,'' ''the pharmaceutical companies,'' ''big polluters'' -- in short, corporate America in general.</p>
        <p>He seems quite willing to play the populist card even if it distorts the record of corporations, fosters antagonism between company leadership and workers and encourages the very stereotyping that, on other fronts, the Democratic Party claims to be against.</p>
        <p>Suddenly business is the enemy. Why, I'm not sure, since the Clinton-Gore team takes such great pains to boast about the economic achievements of the past eight years, including the 22 million new jobs generated by the free enterprise system. Consider the words of Mr. Lieberman in his recent book, ''In Praise of Public Life'': ''We New Democrats believe that the booming economy of the 1990's resulted more from private sector innovation, investment and hard work than from government action.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman got it right. The men and women who make things in America, from skilled workers on the factory floor to innovators in the company lab, have fueled these achievements.</p>
        <p>And these workers have been duly rewarded. Today's manufacturing jobs provide an average yearly compensation of $49,000 per worker, nearly 17 percent higher than in the private sector overall.</p>
        <p>But great success of business in creating good jobs seems to be lost in this campaign. Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman are creating an atmosphere of division between employers and employees at a time when workers and their employers are partners as never before. The newfound angry populism of the Gore-Lieberman ticket distorts the true picture of the American economy and fosters resentment rather than cooperation.</p>
        <p>As another centrist Democrat, the late Senator Paul Tsongas, said in his speech at the 1992 Democratic Convention, ''You cannot redistribute wealth you never created. You can't be pro-jobs and anti-business at the same time. You cannot love employment and hate employers.''</p>
        <p>This year's Democratic ticket would do well to heed these wise words.</p>
