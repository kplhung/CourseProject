        <p>Dresdner Bank in Talks  To Buy Wasserstein Perella Wasserstein Perella is in advanced talks to be acquired by Dresdner Bank of Germany and, if the two can come to terms on price, a deal could be announced in three to five days, a person close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>If an agreement is reached, it would be the symbolic end of the swachbuckling style of deal-making celebrated in the 1980's, which has been replaced by a blander type of investment banking. Market Place. [Page C16.]</p>

        <p>Hewlett Rolls Out New Computer  Hewlett-Packard rolled out the powerful computer it is counting on to lift sales to companies that need systems capable of handling huge amounts of data around the clock. Carly S. Fiorina, Hewlett-Packard's chief executive, hailed the new computer, called Superdome, as a symbol of the company's claim that it has been ''reinvented'' as a more customer-oriented vendor selling solutions rather than products. Ms. Fiorina did not mention the company's talks to acquire the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, but analysts said that such a deal would be consistent with the vision involved in Superdome.

The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index was down 7.27 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,481.99. [C18.]</p>
        <p>Creating a Supportive Atmosphere  Royal Farros, the chief executive of iPrint.com, an online printing service, says managing a company involves a lot of the same expectations and feelings as having pets. Creating a loving, affectionate home for pets is similar to fostering an active environment where employees feel important and influential. Building such a culture is not just critical to the personality of an organization, he says, but absolutely key to its livelihood. The Boss. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Political Volunteers in White Collars  For all the fund-raising by Democrats and Republicans this year, candidates for offices from the the White House to the local school board know one thing is even more important than money: volunteers. And while these unpaid armies are made up mostly of students and retired people, it is business professionals who exhibit the qualities that political candidates value most: nuts-and-bolts organizational skills, management savvy and address books filled with contacts.
