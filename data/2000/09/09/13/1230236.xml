        <p>The cast of ''Big Brother'' continues to drive the show's producers batty. Last week an effort to bribe one of the six remaining contestants to leave the camera-filled house where they have been confined for two months failed because they decided they would present a united front to thwart the producers' main goal of inserting a new participant.</p>
        <p>Then over the weekend the houseguests, as they are called, became so inflamed by the notion that they were being trifled with that they announced they would stage a mass walkout of the house tonight.</p>
        <p>That revolt was short-lived. By Sunday the six had seen the light. If they walked out no one would receive the $500,000 grand prize.</p>
        <p>With the houseguests now apparently locked in for the long haul, the producers began the week still wishing they could find a way to squeeze their new hope, a straightforward and outspoken attractive young woman named Beth, into the house for the show's last two weeks.</p>
        <p>One idea was to let one house member out into the world for one night for a taste of real life. So Curtis, a lawyer from California, won a contest to leave the house and go to  the Emmy Awards show on Sunday  in Los Angeles. He said he decided to  go back into the house, however, partly because he was cheered by fans at the Emmys.</p>
        <p>That left the producers pondering other moves for tonight. Paul Romer, the executive producer, said yesterday that the show had all but resolved to offer a $50,000 prize again to anyone who wanted to leave the show, an offer that would be made just before the audience vote was revealed, determining which houseguest is banished. Cassandra, Curtis and Eddie have been nominated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romer said he would still love to add Beth to the group, ''to add that new impulse.'' And he admitted that the resistance to taking the money baffled the producers.</p>
        <p>''It's the same amount as the third prize, $50,000. Three of the people left are going to walk away with no money.''</p>
