        <p>Treasury officials say abusive corporate tax shelters are the government's biggest tax enforcement problem, costing billions of dollars annually. Now, a company called the Tax People is teaching similarly dubious tax avoidance techniques to middle-class Americans at a time when the Internal Revenue Service's ability to enforce the tax laws is at a historical low.</p>
        <p>At the Tax People's national convention last month, 3,500 people hollered with delight as the president told them that not only would they cut their tax bills but they would also grow rich by selling the same tax-advice system to other Americans.</p>
        <p>The key to the system, for which the Tax People says 50,000 people have signed up, is to set up a home business. For almost everyone who participates, that business is to sell the ''tax relief'' system to others. Then, almost any time the taxpayer leaves the house -- whether to commute to a day job, buy groceries, play golf or go to church -- he deducts the cost of the trip as a business expense on the ground that everywhere he goes he is doing business recruiting customers.</p>
        <p>''Golf, hunting, fishing and even vacations with your family'' can become tax-deductible expenses, asserts a brochure from the Tax People. Learn it all for $300 down and $100 a month -- costs that are themselves deductible. It does not stop there. Hire the children to clean the home office and then provide them with a fringe benefit -- their college education -- and deduct the cost as a business expense.</p>
        <p>The Tax People's president, Michael Cooper, 46, of Topeka, Kan., said he was marketing ''a way for people to legally, ethically and morally reduce their taxes to the absolute legal minimum so they can get out of debt and enjoy the lifestyle they deserve.''</p>
        <p>But a variety of seasoned tax experts who have examined the Tax People system said they did not share the Tax People's views on the legitimacy of the techniques. ''This is very clever,'' said Professor Charles Davenport, a Rutgers Law School tax professor, when asked to examine the system. ''They have created a system to cheat.''</p>
        <p>The Tax People is just one example of the vulnerability of the income tax system to questionable operations in an era when Congress has sharply reduced the resources to hunt for tax cheats and has imposed new rules that make it difficult for I.R.S. agents to pursue cases. Indeed, because of weakened enforcement, more people are cutting their taxes, though their deductions may not be legitimate, the experts said.</p>
        <p>The Tax People, which has been selling its system since late 1997, advertises that a family of four with $60,000 of wages can take $33,560 in federal income tax deductions if they have a home-based business with just $1,000 of revenue. Those deductions would cut their federal tax bill 81 percent, to $1,384.</p>
        <p>But tax law requires that a business report a taxable profit at least two of every five years, or those deductions will be disallowed. That is no problem, said Jesse Cota, a former I.R.S. district director and head of the Tax People's ''tax dream team.'' He said one need only switch to a different money-losing business every three or four years to take these deductions for life.</p>
        <p>The Tax People has ardent supporters. In San Diego, Mr. Cooper introduced the Rev. Terry Thomas, a retired Army sergeant who leads an independent congregation on the Japanese island of Okinawa, and his wife, Phyllis, noting that their trip was a tax-deductible expense.</p>
        <p>The couple said they were thrilled with the system and that since joining in July they had signed up 33 other people. ''The Tax People teaches people to be debt free, and by selling this system we can help people do that,'' Mr. Thomas said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thomas said those who embrace the system ''tend to be visionary and business-oriented people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas said the integrity of the Tax People was critical to his involvement. ''We are in the business of helping people, and we feel this is a way to help people achieve financial freedom,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Independent tax experts say the Tax People is advertising techniques that can be legal only in unusual circumstances and is glossing over limits on who can use them. For example, the rule allowing a deduction for commuting expenses applies only when one's wage job and home business are in the same line of work and the taxpayer can show a bona fide expense.</p>
        <p>As another example, the Tax People teaches that the owner of a home-based business can deduct $5,250 in education benefits for each child if the child is employed in the business. But among the many complex rules to qualify for this tax break, is one requiring that the business first give the same benefit to at least 19 nonfamily employees at a cost of $99,750.</p>
        <p>The tax experts warned that while many of the techniques the Tax People teaches may have a patina of legality, they would not survive an audit because they ignore complex tax rules. Indeed, the techniques are similar to some used by big companies that have been criticized as abusive by Treasury officials, in that they have no purpose except tax avoidance, as opposed to a legitimate business purpose.</p>
        <p>But even if adherents of the Tax People abuse the rules, they might get away with it, tax experts say. Congress has cut the budget for auditing tax returns. For those who file the kind of tax return that the Tax People recommends, there was only a one in 77 chance of being audited last year, down from one in 31 in 1994.</p>
        <p>And if a taxpayer is audited, the I.R.S. is more likely to pursue further the cases of people who do not keep good business records. Because Tax People teaches members to keep exhaustively detailed records, even dubious deductions might make it past the I.R.S. simply because the deductions appear to be documented.</p>
        <p>Sheldon Cohen, the I.R.S. commissioner during the Johnson administration, said the I.R.S. has the power to shut down the Tax People, but he doubted it would act.</p>
        <p>After examining the Tax People literature, Mr. Cohen said that if the Tax People had come along in his day ''I would have issued a summons for the names of everyone who has paid for the system and then we would have mailed each of them a letter saying that this is not legitimate, but if you file an amended return, then that will be the end of it with no penalties, but if you do not then we will come after you.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Charles O. Rossotti, the current tax commissioner, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>The Tax People is under scrutiny by state officials in Kansas and Missouri.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper, in an interview, confirmed the investigations and said that state officials suspected, wrongly, that he was running a pyramid scheme in which an expanding base of recruits paid fees that were funneled up to the top.</p>
        <p>Carla Stovall, the Kansas attorney general, said company records showed that virtually all of those buying the system were trying to make money selling it to others.</p>
        <p>She said her attention was drawn to the company in part because of complaints by people who said they were lured into paying four enrollment fees with a promise that doing so would bolster their earnings as independent marketing associates.</p>
        <p>''I believe it is illogical for people to buy four or more tax relief systems unless it is to expand the pyramid,'' Ms. Stovall said.</p>
        <p>Three times in the last six years Kansas authorities have moved against Mr. Cooper and his marketing companies with accusations of fraudulent and deceptive practices. He twice signed consent decrees.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mr. Cooper told marketing associates that he would give each of them 1,000 shares of stock in his company, which he valued at $40 a share now and a fortune in the near future. Kansas securities regulators valued the shares at one five-hundredth of a penny each.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper was recorded telling the associates that the stock gift was ''double secret stuff'' that ''cannot be discussed publicly'' and expressing concern about violating securities laws.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper, in an interview, said  he thought his gifts of the stock were legal. ''I had legal advisers, and I thought it was all appropriate,'' he said. ''I paid a $10,000 fine, and I am still giving the stock away.''</p>
        <p>Those who join the Tax People get a slim booklet and audio tapes that explain complex tax avoidance strategies in very simple language.</p>
        <p>W. Bradford Murray, a businessman in San Rafael, Calif., is suing Mr. Cooper and the Tax People in Federal court in Kansas City. Mo., for copyright infringement, saying much of the best tax advice in the Tax People manual was taken verbatim from Mr. Murray's work. The company says it acquired the rights legally through an intermediary.</p>
        <p>Recruits can also listen in on daily conference calls with tax preparers and accountants who are affiliated with the organization and, at the end, can ask questions about their own tax concerns.</p>
        <p>In the event a return is audited, the Tax People promises that its dream team of tax experts will represent the taxpayer. The Tax People says it has a 100 percent success rate in audits and that in 60 percent of the cases the I.R.S. approves additional reductions in the taxpayer's bill.</p>
        <p>At the meeting in San Diego of 3,500 of what the company calls independent marketing associates, the Tax People's speakers repeatedly characterized the tax dream team as having such prowess that when the I.R.S. learns who is representing the taxpayer it quickly ''wilts.''</p>
        <p>Frank Keith, the senior I.R.S. spokesman, said that ''we decide cases on the basics of facts and law, not who represents the taxpayer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper has not disclosed any documentation of his company's claim of 100 percent success in audits and getting an increased refund in 60 percent of cases.</p>
        <p>He also said he had not set aside any reserves for the cost of future audits. He said in an interview that if the I.R.S. were to make targets of his clients the company might not have the resources to fulfill its audit representation promise. ''That's a risk you take with any business, that they might not be there to honor the guarantee,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The audit guarantee itself is limited. Not only must the marketing associate have done exactly as instructed by the Tax People manual, meticulous records must also have been kept.</p>
        <p>The audit representation guarantee ends if the individual stops paying the $100 monthly fee. Typically, I.R.S. audits begin 18 months or more after a tax return is filed. Thus an individual who paid Mr. Cooper's company $6,300 over five years and then retired and stopped paying would have no right to audit representation if his tax returns were selected later for audit.</p>
        <p>Darlene Siddons, a San Diego woman who bought audit protection from Mr. Cooper's company, said she could not persuade the company to represent her last year until she went to the Tax People sales meetings and loudly declared that the company was not delivering on its promises. She said Mr. Cooper eventually hired someone to represent her but that she lost her deductions. Other clients say they were well represented, though one said he had to pay additional taxes.</p>
        <p>Critics also say the Tax People's Web sites make inflated promises. Many, for example, guarantee $5,000 in tax savings, when the company actually promises only $5,000 in tax deductions. ''That's a huge difference,'' said Mike Wellman, a Texas  tax accountant who is one of a half-dozen tax professionals who have sought in an Internet news group to debunk the Tax People's statements. ''No one at the company seems to be correcting the false claims by the marketing agents, but then what incentive does the company have to police its sales force?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nathan Zehr of Watertown, N.Y., said he paid $1,200 for four subscriptions because he was told this would make him eligible for bonus payments if he sold the system to others.</p>
        <p>But he said that after contacting the Better Business Bureau in Kansas he had questions about the company and began calling its customer-service number to stop further charges on his credit card. ''I could never get through,'' he said, so he canceled his credit card number to stop further charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zehr said he regarded the Tax People as ''unethical, dishonest and fraudulent.''</p>
        <p>Mike Nelson of Wichita, Kan., said he, too, could not get the company to stop charging his credit card $100 a month and the customer-service line was answered with a recording saying that the company was so busy processing new orders it did not have anyone available to process cancellations. Last night, he said, his money was finally refunded, though his calls were never answered.</p>
