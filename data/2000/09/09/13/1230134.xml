        <p>UKRAINE: PUTIN DEATH PLOT FOILED -- Tipped off by unidentified foreign intelligence services, Ukrainian agents foiled a bid to assassinate President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Yalta last month, the head of Ukraine's security service said. At the time the security chief, Leonid Derkach, said four Chechens had been held, along with several Middle East residents. Russia has long asserted that Chechen rebels are supported by Middle East militants.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: THE KURSK'S FUTURE -- The minister for atomic energy, Yevgeny Adamov, said it might be safer to leave the submarine Kursk in the Barents Sea rather than risk a nuclear accident by raising it. ''From the point of view of the nuclear reactors, and the nuclear situation, there is no need to raise the submarine,'' he said. Environmental groups have warned of the risk of leaking radiation in adjacent fishing grounds. An aide to Mr. Adamov said he was concerned that cutting holes to retrieve crew remains could further weaken the vessel and make its raising more dangerous.</p>

        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: MILOSEVIC STARTS CAMPAIGN -- President Slobodan Milosevic made his first campaign appearance before elections Sept. 24, starting a new turbine at a power plant near the Romanian border. Mr. Milosevic, addressing some 10,000 supporters, praised his country's resilience and attacked the West and its supporters. ''This is the answer to violence and injustice, a proof of the civilizational superiority of our nation, undefeated and unconquered by evil,'' he said.</p>

        <p>IRELAND: POPULATION GROWING -- Ireland marked its tenth successive year of population growth, reaching a total of 3.79 million people in the year to last April, the highest level since 1881. Immigrants outnumbered people leaving the country for the fifth year in a row, by 42,300 to 18,200. Irish returning from abroad accounted for 43 percent of immigrants, the largest single group.</p>

        <p>CANADA: TORIES DEFECT -- Accelerating the slow-motion implosion of the traditional conservative party, two Tory members of Parliament have defected to the Liberals. The move deflated the Monday night victory of Joe Clark, the Tory leader, who was elected to Parliament. Stockwell Day, leader of the Canadian Alliance, was also elected. With 57 seats, four times that of the Tories, Mr. Day will become leader of the opposition when Parliament reconvenes on Monday.</p>

        <p>VENEZUELA: INVITATION TO RUSSIA -- In another indication of its increasingly prominent role in OPEC, Venezuela announced that President Hugo Chavez had invited Russia to join the oil cartel and that ''the Russian government is seriously studying the possibility.'' Energy Minister Ali Rodriguez is the president of OPEC, and the 11-member group will be meeting in Caracas on Sept. 27 and 28.</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: PEACE TALKS CONTINUE -- After meeting in Paris with representatives of the government of Colombia and the country's second-largest guerrilla group, the five nations acting as intermediaries in the decades-old civil conflict said they would soon visit an area in Colombia controlled by the group, the Army of National Liberation. The delegation will include envoys from Cuba, France, Norway, Spain and Switzerland who have been involved in peace talks that have made little noticeable progress.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>CHINA: SMUGGLING TRIALS -- Trials will begin today in China's largest corruption scandal, the vast smuggling of goods through the southern port of Xiamen in a case that has implicated scores of senior customs, police and Communist Party officials. Hearings will get under way in four different cities in Fujian Province, officials told The Associated Press, but the number of defendants was not disclosed.</p>

        <p>KASHMIR: CEASE-FIRE RULED OUT -- The leader of the rebel Hizbul Mujahedeen, Syed Salahuddin, said he had ruled out any further cease-fire offers from his group and said it is up to India to make a move toward peace. Guerrillas have increased their attacks on Indian military units, while artillery exchanges have also intensified.</p>

        <p>IRAN: 18 CITED IN DISSIDENT SLAYINGS -- The judiciary has indicted 18 people, including senior intelligence officials, on charges of murdering dissidents, newspapers reported. They will stand trial in a military court for the murder of four intellectuals in 1998, a senior judiciary official was quoted as saying by the daily Hayat-e No. Other papers published similar reports. A key suspect, former Deputy Intelligence Minister Saeed Emami, died in custody last year, reportedly a suicide.</p>

        <p>MAURITIUS: OPPOSITION VICTORY -- An opposition alliance made up of the political old guard swept into power after elections on Mauritius. Official results showed Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam's party won just 6 seats in the 62-member national assembly elections. The opposition alliance headed by former Prime Minister Sir Anerood Jugnauth won 54, while a small local party won the only 2 on the neighboring Indian Ocean island of Rodrigues.</p>

        <p>CONGO: 33 DIE IN NEW VIOLENCE -- New fighting in the volatile eastern part of Congo has left at least 33 people dead, rebel officials said. Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, who heads an Ugandan-backed rebel faction, said at least 19 opposing militiamen died Monday when they attacked his forces near Uganda. In a separate incident near the-Burundi border, Mai Mai fighters reportedly ambushed a truck and killed 14 people.</p>
