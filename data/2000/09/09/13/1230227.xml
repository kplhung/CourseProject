        <p>The best September Mike Piazza ever had was in 1997, when he batted .406 with eight homers for the Los Angeles Dodgers. But the Dodgers still missed the playoffs that year, and the example backs up Piazza's case that the Mets do not just follow his lead.</p>
        <p>That is an easy assumption to make, based on the evidence. Piazza has hit .167 this month, and the Mets have slumped with him, who had been 2-8 entering last night's game, a victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at Shea in which Piazza didn't play. Their struggles would seem to be largely a case of follow the leader.</p>

        <p>The best September Mike Piazza ever had was in 1997, when he batted .406 with eight homers for the Los Angeles Dodgers. But the Dodgers still missed the playoffs that year, and the example backs up Piazza's case that the Mets do not just follow his lead.</p>
        <p>That is an easy assumption to make, based on the evidence. Piazza has hit .167 this month, and the Mets have slumped with him, who had been 2-8 entering last night's game, a victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at Shea in which Piazza didn't play. Their struggles would seem to be largely a case of follow the leader.</p>
        <p>Piazza is paid $13 million a year to be the leader of the Mets' offense, and he accepts that his responsibilities are greater than anyone else's. But as the disappointment of 1997 showed, he cannot carry a team by himself.</p>
        <p>''If we're able to get back and play the way we can, it'll be a team-wide thing,'' Piazza said. ''It's obvious my job is a lot bigger than most guys', but it's a team, and that's the only way we're going to win.''</p>
        <p>Piazza caught on Sunday, which was a day game after a night game, and he played again on Monday before sitting out last night's game. Because the Mets' slide has not cost them much ground in the wild-card race -- they led Arizona by four and a half games before last night's games -- Piazza has gotten more rest than he did last year.</p>
        <p>Then, with a playoff spot perilous, Piazza caught 30 of the Mets' last 32 games. He caught in 137 games over all, batting .248 in September and October and .182 in the postseason.</p>
        <p>This year, because of the Mets' cushion, Piazza has gotten much more rest. He has caught 109 games so far, with 35 days off. He will finish this season with at least 10 more days off than he had last year, presumably making him fresher for the postseason.</p>
        <p>''I feel pretty good; it's nothing physical that I can think of,'' Piazza said, later adding, ''I'll be the first to say I'm not swinging the bat the way I want to be, but I'm not going to blame that on fatigue. I've caught a lot of ballgames, but I've been at this point many times in my career when I've finished strong.''</p>
        <p>The problem this month, the Mets' hitting coach, Tom Robson, said, is that Piazza has been overeager at the plate, and he has pulled too many balls instead of staying back and using his superior strength to drive the ball to right field. ''He's probably trying a little harder, too,'' Robson said.</p>
        <p>Ventura's Back</p>
        <p>Believing that the struggling third baseman, Robin Ventura, has made sufficient progress on his swing, Bobby Valentine put him back in the lineup last night, sending Matt Franco back to the bench. ''His batting practice today had the look of old,'' Valentine said of Ventura, who went 1 for 5 against the Brewers.</p>
        <p>But because Franco had two hits, including a homer, on Monday, Valentine wanted to start him again last night. He stopped first baseman Todd Zeile on Zeile's way out of the clubhouse Monday night, but Zeile said he wanted to play last night. Valentine let him, and Franco will start today's series finale, probably at first base.</p>
        <p>The Forgotten Man</p>
        <p>For the Mets, there has probably been no more dramatic hit this month than the two-out, two-run, game-tying homer by Bubba Trammell in St. Louis on Sept. 3. The Mets lost in extra innings, but Trammell, who knocked in three runs and had two hits, had done his part.</p>
        <p>But with three other right-handed-hitting outfielders in the starting lineup, Trammell has found it difficult to get playing time since then. In fact, going into last night's game with the Brewers, he has not played at all since that game.</p>
        <p>''I want to play every day; every hitter does,'' Trammell said. ''As a player, you want to try to help. But we've got guys who can play, and I'm going to do whatever I can to help.''</p>
        <p>Trammell, however, has had difficulty with his current role. He marvels at the way Lenny Harris can stay sharp despite limited playing time, and he has talked with Harris about having good at-bats despite getting few chances.</p>
        <p>Trammell, acquired in a trade with Tampa Bay in July, believes he can be a regular in the majors when he gets the chance. ''I just feel like one day, my time will come to play every day,'' Trammell said. ''And if I ever get that chance, I'll always be an everyday player, no doubt.''</p>
