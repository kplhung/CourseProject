        <p>Top executives from De Beers, the supplier of half the world's rough-cut diamonds, met with Russian executives and government officials yesterday in Moscow to persuade them that its new company strategy would not harm the diamond trade in Russia, the world's second-largest producer of diamonds. Russia's monopoly producer, Alrosa, said it would continue to work with De Beers and expected to conclude a new contract before the current one expires late next year. That was in contrast to comments by Russian government officials in July that Russia may change its relations with the South Africa-based producer.</p>
