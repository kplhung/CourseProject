        <p>Correction of Sept 9 obituary of singer Rebert Harris; several facts noted</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A headline and a picture caption on Saturday with an obituary of Rebert  H. Harris, lead singer of the Soul Stirrers, characterized their music incorrectly. They were gospel singers, not soul singers.</p>
        <p>Because of an editing error, the obituary also omitted the given name and background of a producer. He is  Anthony Heilbut, a gospel historian and Mr. Harris's former producer.</p>
        <p>The obituary also misspelled the surnames of two members of the Soul Stirrers. They were Thomas Breuster (not Brewster) and Roy Crain (not Crane).</p>
