        <p>In a significant step for thousands of Holocaust victims who have fought for decades to recover their savings from Swiss banks, a special master appointed by a federal judge overseeing a class action lawsuit submitted a complex plan yesterday for distributing $1.25 billion in settlement payments from the banks.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, $800 million from the settlement would be set aside to repay Holocaust survivors or heirs who can show that they held accounts in Swiss banks during the World War II era.</p>
        <p>Where account balances can be proven, the money would be refunded in full with interest and adjusted for inflation. Where balances are not known, victims or their heirs would get at least 35 percent of amounts recommended case-by-case by an independent tribunal in Zurich. To date,  26,000 Swiss accounts have been identified as probably belonging to victims of Nazi persecution.</p>
        <p>The remaining $450 million would be divided among survivors -- but not heirs -- from four other classes of Holocaust victims. An estimated 200,000 slave laborers who worked for German companies and a smaller number who worked for Swiss companies would be paid up to $1,000 each. About 17,000 refugees who were denied entrance to Switzerland during the war would get up to $2,500 each, while 3,000 refugees detained in Switzerland under abusive conditions would be entitled to $500 each.</p>
        <p>Another $100 million would be set aside to help compensate those whose assets were looted by the Nazis and then deposited in Swiss accounts. But rather than distribute it to individual survivors, most of the money would be given to organizations that provide aid to elderly and destitute Holocaust survivors in the former Soviet Union. A final $10 million would be used to compile, for research and remembrance, a list of all who were the target of persecution under the Nazis.</p>
        <p>Edward R. Korman, the United States District Court judge in Brooklyn who is overseeing the case, will hold a public hearing on the proposal on Nov. 20. He could adopt the proposal, reject it or modify it.</p>
