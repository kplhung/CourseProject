        <p>For nearly two decades, a lawsuit accusing this city of intentionally segregating its schools has shaped almost every educational decision here -- from bus routes to curriculum to spending -- and kept a perpetual flame under debates about race.</p>
        <p>But now, for the first time, almost all the major players here say the long case is nearing an end, promising to put the city back in charge of its own school system, which has been overseen by a court-appointed monitor since 1986.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki has provided $10 million in state funds that will help settle the case, by reassuring the court that there is adequate financing for the schools. State and city officials have held a daylong meeting to sketch out possible ways of settling the case, and Mayor John Spencer says he expects a settlement within six months.</p>
        <p>The court-appointed monitor who has overseen the schools since 1986 is hoping to meet with the state and city this week to talk about a timetable for the settlement.</p>
        <p>Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court issued an order late last month that encouraged the settlement talks. He said he would withhold any decisions on pending litigation -- and after 20 years there are still aspects of this complex lawsuit pending -- in the expectation that he will receive a proposed settlement agreement. Even the N.A.A.C.P., which brought the original lawsuit in 1980, is talking about conditions under which it would accept a settlement.</p>
        <p>''These are the strongest signs yet that this is coming to an end,'' said the monitor, Joseph M. Pastore. ''It's a courtship of sorts. You have to look for signals and signs, you've got to look for the right moment and the right mood.''</p>
        <p>If the mood is right, it may be in part because the governor established a significant dowry of sorts when he stood on the steps of City Hall here last month and pledged the $10 million toward a resolution agreement.</p>
        <p>In announcing the money at a press conference, the governor was joined by all the major adversaries in the case, in a display of harmony that stood in stark contrast to the shouting matches and picketing that once punctuated public meetings about the schools.</p>
        <p>The move toward a settlement started in July 1999, when the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that there was insufficient evidence that discrimination by the city and state were responsible for a large gap between the achievement of black and white students. That court sent the case back to Judge Sand to determine whether there are still vestiges of segregation in the schools.</p>
        <p>The mayor, who has pledged an end to federal court involvement in most of his major speeches in five years in office, argues there are no such vestiges.</p>
        <p>Demographics now makes ''desegregation'' something of a misnomer. When the case began, about 35 percent of the students in the system were black or Hispanic. Now, about 75 percent of students are black or Hispanic. When every school has a student body where whites are in the minority, it is increasingly difficult to argue that black students are segregated in inferior schools.</p>
        <p>Federal intervention has meant more money for the schools, new buildings and special magnet programs. But the blunt-spoken mayor terms efforts to achieve desegregation a mistake imposed by ''social engineering liberals,'' who he said vowed to improve the schools but only ended up making them worse.</p>
        <p>''That's the bottom line of this,'' the mayor said. ''After 17 years of federal intervention, education has not improved.''</p>
        <p>''What I resent,'' the mayor added, ''Is the idea that the N.A.A.C.P. are the only ones who care about educating minority children. I resent that. We all care about children.''</p>
        <p>What would look different if the city controlled the schools? The mayor says he looks to Chicago as his model for improving schools, and has spoken to officials there. He wants smaller class sizes, an end to social promotion -- the practice of advancing students to the next grade even if they have not met the standards of the previous one -- greater parent involvement and partnerships with teachers.</p>
        <p>What the N.A.A.C.P. wants for the schools sounds remarkably like what the mayor proposes -- smaller classes and higher standards. But Leonard Buddington, president of the Yonkers chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., accuses city officials of paying ''lip service to those issues.''</p>
        <p>''The governor and the mayor are taking a very myopic, narrow view of what this case is about, because they're obviously under the impression that money is going to make the problems go away,'' Mr. Buddington said.</p>
        <p>Michael H. Sussman, who argued the case for the N.A.A.C.P. as a young lawyer in the 1980's and has continued arguing about it in and out of court since then, says there are still vestiges of segregation in the schools. A report commissioned by the school board last year concluded that there were vestiges, he says.</p>
        <p>''There are gaps on every single measure of educational performance,'' he said. ''Graduation rates, dropout rates, special education rates. That's well beyond test scores. There are gaps on every measure and every indicia of educational attainment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buddington says the schools will need court-ordered supervision  for another two to four years, and should have to demonstrate progress in closing the black-white gap for two years before the federal monitor's role ends. Still, that kind of deadline is more specific than most of the group's comments over the last few years.</p>
        <p>Much of the settlement, like much of the case, will depend on how much money the state and city pledge for new programs. The courts have ruled that Yonkers and the state are both responsible for paying for programs to reverse the impact of segregation. The state points out that it has increased the money it gives to Yonkers; this year's allocation of $133 million is a 15.4 percent increase over last year's, compared with an average increase in school aid of 8.7 percent statewide. But Yonkers, the state's fourth-largest school district,  says it still contributes more money for its schools and gets less from the state than the other large school districts, like Buffalo and Rochester.</p>
        <p>The state and the city spent several months bickering about money earlier this year. But after discussions that began in July, Governor Pataki's office agreed to provide more money, as long as Yonkers maintains its effort as well.</p>
        <p>''We're committed to working with all sides to get the federal courts out of the schools,'' said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the governor. ''It's long past time to have that happen. What other school district in the state is controlled by an outside force? We think it's best to have the local community running their schools.''</p>
        <p>Those who will be involved in approving the final settlement say the state and the city will likely have discussions through the fall, and after that, bring the N.A.A.C.P. and the United States Department of Justice, who were the plaintiffs in the original case, into the talks.</p>
        <p>Whether the monitoring might be phased out in any settlement is something that will be decided in the talks with the plaintiffs. Some city officials doubt the N.A.A.C.P. will let go of the case, which they say has been its primary mission for two decades.</p>
        <p>But at some point, they say, the courts may force them to do so.</p>
