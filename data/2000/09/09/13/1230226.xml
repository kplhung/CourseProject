        <p>Memo to the Bush campaign team: Can you spell backfire?</p>
        <p>For the moment, at least, it is spelled RATS, and Gov. George W. Bush must be seething despite his labored attempt to shrug off ''conspiracy theories'' about his campaign's latest fiasco. That, of course, was the insertion of the word RATS in capital letters into a television ad attacking Vice President Al Gore over the issue of prescription drugs for Medicare.</p>
        <p>News of the ad, coming after the governor's embarrassing problems with an open microphone 10 days ago, launched a new round of jokes and questions about his technologically challenged campaign. Even a studiously somber Vice President Al Gore expressed puzzlement over the strangeness of the episode. Other Democrats were predictably gleeful, and Paul Begala, a party strategist, questioned whether an organization that cannot handle the rewind button can be entrusted with the nuclear button.</p>
        <p>Smart Republicans know that, all kidding aside, this is a fraught moment for the Bush campaign. The governor's malapropisms are becoming standard comic fare. Yesterday he referred four times to ''subliminable'' techniques. Meanwhile a conservative publication, The Weekly Standard, features on its cover a worried-looking Mr. Bush beside the slightly panicky-sounding headline ''How Bush Can Win.'' Being an object of doubt and ridicule can quickly become a serious problem for a presidential candidate. Just ask Michael Dukakis.</p>
        <p>Forceful damage control would be Mr. Bush's smartest move. He has already pulled the ad. But since subliminal messages are regarded as unethical by the ad industry and unfairly deceptive by the Federal Communications Commission, Mr. Bush should go further. He needs to find out how it got on the air in the first place, especially since Alex Castellanos, who produced the commercial for the Republican National Committee, has not kept his story straight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Castellanos originally told Richard Berke of The Times that the use of the word was ''purely accidental.'' Yesterday he said he was using a ''visual drumbeat designed to make you look at the word bureaucrats.'' That sounds to us like a declaration of intent to use subliminal techniques by Mr. Castellanos, who is known as a creator of attack ads. If Mr. Bush really means that such techniques are not acceptable to his campaign, perhaps he should sever his connection with Mr. Castellanos.</p>
        <p>When a presidential campaign has the stumbles, such decisive action by the nominee can be a step toward getting back on message, a place Mr. Bush has hardly visited in the last two weeks.</p>
