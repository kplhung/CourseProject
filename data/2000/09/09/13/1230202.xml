        <p>While Jon S. Corzine is blanketing New Jersey with sunny television commercials promoting his ''fiscal discipline'' and his ''faith in the American dream,'' his Republican opponent in the race for the United States Senate, Representative Bob Franks, has zeroed in on Mr. Corzine's finances and his apparent lack of forthrightness as inviting targets for what is becoming a sharply focused line of attack.</p>

        <p>Mr. Corzine, who spent $35 million of his $400 million fortune during the primary campaign, has had to continue to defend his refusal to release his personal tax returns, saying again that he is handcuffed by a confidentiality agreement with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, the investment bank he headed until last year.

        <p>While Jon S. Corzine is blanketing New Jersey with sunny television commercials promoting his ''fiscal discipline'' and his ''faith in the American dream,'' his Republican opponent in the race for the United States Senate, Representative Bob Franks, has zeroed in on Mr. Corzine's finances and his apparent lack of forthrightness as inviting targets for what is becoming a sharply focused line of attack.</p>
        <p>In the last week, Mr. Corzine has had to admit that he misstated his voting record and concede that he was unaware that a trailer-park company he had invested in had raised rents for poor tenants by nearly 30 percent and evicted others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who spent $35 million of his $400 million fortune during the primary campaign, has had to continue to defend his refusal to release his personal tax returns, saying again that he is handcuffed by a confidentiality agreement with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, the investment bank he headed until last year. And he has had to explain why he postponed, until after the election, filing a report listing the groups that received the millions of dollars his private foundation gave out in 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who is spending $1.2 million this week for TV ads describing his stands on gun control, health care and education, shrugs off these recent stumbles and says Mr. Franks is focusing on them to divert attention from his record.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Franks, who still has little money to spend for his own commercials, has nonetheless begun to get attention by portraying Mr. Corzine's missteps as part of a larger pattern of ''hiding and buying'' -- concealing information that might reflect poorly on Mr. Corzine while trying to buy the election with a largely televised campaign.</p>
        <p>''We are two months from this year's election, and some very disturbing questions still surround this man,'' said Mr. Franks's spokesman, Charlie Smith. ''His willingness to say anything at any given time, and his steadfast refusal to release what is essentially the funding behind his record-setting campaign, starkly raise the credibility question.'' Political analysts said Mr. Franks was right to call attention to Mr. Corzine's wealth since part of the electorate -- nearly a third, in one recent poll -- is troubled by how much his campaign is spending.</p>
        <p>''None of this stuff disqualifies Corzine from office,'' said David P. Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University. ''But the effect can be cumulative. If the Franks campaign can draw a more detailed picture of Corzine as wealthy, out of touch and unable to handle questions in a public setting, then Franks can get some mileage and score some points. Because the way Bob Franks wins votes is by putting a wedge between Corzine and the average voter.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks runs the risk, of course, that Mr. Corzine will be provoked into turning his television howitzers against his opponent sooner rather than later in the campaign. But for now, at least, Mr. Corzine is giving Mr. Franks plenty of small-arms ammunition.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday, what should have been a coup for Mr. Corzine, his endorsement by the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, became an embarrassment. When reporters, prompted by Mr. Franks's aides, asked Mr. Corzine why he had not voted for the state's 1998 open-space bond issue, Mr. Corzine said that, in fact, he had. In fact, he had not, as his spokesman acknowledged hours later. The episode gave Mr. Franks a chance both to question Mr. Corzine's veracity and to remind voters that Mr. Corzine had missed 17 primary elections and 5 general elections since 1975.</p>
        <p>As if that were not enough, Mr. Corzine's private philanthropy, the Jon and Joanne Corzine Foundation, owes the Internal Revenue Service a separate tax return, for the year ended Jan. 31.</p>
        <p>For months, Mr. Corzine has denied suggestions that he used the foundation to buy community support for his Senate campaign. And its  tax return would list all its gifts. But on Monday, Mr. Corzine filed for a second extension of the deadline for the foundation's return, until Dec. 15. The Franks campaign immediately questioned the need for a delay until after Election Day.</p>
        <p>Tom Shea, Mr. Corzine's spokesman, said Mr. Corzine asked for the extension because the foundation gave much more away than in prior years and because he had hired a new accountant.</p>
