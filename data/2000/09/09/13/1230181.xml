        <p>Dick Cheney realized a profit of $20.6 million last month as he cashed in most of his stake in the Halliburton Company, which he ran until he left to become the Republican candidate for vice president, he reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's sales, from Aug. 21 through Aug. 28, came before he announced on Sept. 1 that he would forfeit some options in Halliburton if the Republican ticket is elected. At that time, he did not disclose that he had already sold a large part of his holding in the energy company.</p>
        <p>The options that he said he would forfeit, worth $3.9 million at the current price of Halliburton stock, cannot be exercised until well after the new administration takes office. Critics had argued that having a large stake in Halliburton, an energy services company whose share price tends to rise and fall in line with oil prices, would be a conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>Halliburton's share price has risen 29 percent since Halliburton's board accepted his retirement on July 25.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney, Juleanna Glover Weiss, would not say yesterday if Mr. Cheney had made any additional sales since Aug. 28. She described the sales as ''part of normal efforts he would take to divest himself of the securities,'' but did not say why he had not mentioned them in his Sept. 1 announcement.</p>
        <p>In a filing delivered to the S.E.C. on Friday and released yesterday, Mr. Cheney said he had exercised options on 650,000 shares of Halliburton and sold the shares, earning a profit of $18.5 million before taxes.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he transferred 39,200 shares of Halliburton back to the company at a price of $54 per share, for a total of $2.1 million. That money was used to pay withholding taxes on the value of the shares he received from Halliburton as part of his retirement package.</p>
        <p>Added to a profit of $3 million he earned in cashing in 100,000 options in May, before he joined the ticket, Mr. Cheney has realized profits of $23.6 million on his Halliburton securities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney still has 210,800 shares of Halliburton, all of which he was given by the company, worth $11.5 million at yesterday's closing price of $54.38 per share.</p>
        <p>He has only 33,333 more options that he could cash in now, on which he would have a profit of $875,000 at current prices. Options now worth $3.5 million can be exercised in December, after the election but before the inauguration. In addition, he has 100,000 options to buy shares at $54.50, slightly above the current price, that could be exercised now. But there would be no profit from those options unless the stock price rises.</p>
        <p>Stock options allow the holder to buy stock at a fixed price. If the stock has risen substantially, as it has since many of Mr. Cheney's options were granted, large profits can be realized.</p>
