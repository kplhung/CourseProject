        <p>WATCHING political candidates on the prowl used to be simple. They kissed babies, and that was it. Now, we have to put up with all kinds of kisses, along with endless pontificating over what each one means.</p>
        <p>It was a big deal last month when Vice President Al Gore gave his wife, Tipper, a full-mouthed smooch on national television. But the gasping over that was nothing compared with the months of huffing and puffing over air kisses that Hillary Rodham Clinton exchanged last year with Suha Arafat, wife of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat.</p>

        <p>WATCHING political candidates on the prowl used to be simple. They kissed babies, and that was it. Now, we have to put up with all kinds of kisses, along with endless pontificating over what each one means.</p>
        <p>It was a big deal last month when Vice President Al Gore gave his wife, Tipper, a full-mouthed smooch on national television. But the gasping over that was nothing compared with the months of huffing and puffing over air kisses that Hillary Rodham Clinton exchanged last year with Suha Arafat, wife of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat.</p>
        <p>Lately, the head-shaking has been accompanied by some hand-shaking.</p>
        <p>President Clinton clasped Fidel Castro's hand when their paths crossed at the United Nations Millennium Summit last week. That practically gave some people the vapors, including Representative Rick A. Lazio, Mrs. Clinton's opponent in the Senate race. Flesh-pressing with despots is unacceptable, he said. So is air-kissing despots' wives.</p>
        <p>Mischievous souls that they can be, White House officials released a 1998 photo showing Mr. Lazio in the Gaza Strip, firmly clasping the hand of that awful Mr. Arafat. On the congressman's face was what former Mayor Edward I. Koch described as a ''molasses licking'' grin.</p>
        <p>So here we are. All these people who would shape New York's political life are fighting over soul-searing questions like which hand is more foul to touch: that of a bearded dictator in the Caribbean or of a bearded dictator in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Or how about this puzzler that is sure to keep you up nights: which is worse, cozying up to a man regarded by some as the devil or making nice with the devil's wife?</p>
        <p>If you ask Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, it is all terrible, this touching and kissing of unsavory types. Mr. Arafat has blood on his hands, the mayor groused this week. It might be noted that in 1994 Mr. Giuliani gave City Hall honors to Gerry Adams, the political spokesman for the Irish Republican Army. At the time, the State Department considered the I.R.A. a terrorist organization. Oh, well. Once again, one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter.</p>
        <p>Since the politicians seem to have trouble sorting out right from wrong, guidance was sought from experts in body language. What, they were asked, should one think about this touchy-feely business?</p>
        <p>Being smart people, they steered clear of party politics. But they suggested that perhaps all sides were making too much of a few simple gestures. You must remember this, they said in effect, sometimes a kiss is just a kiss. Ditto for a handshake.</p>
        <p>As a forensic psychiatrist at New York University Medical Center, Dr. Sasha Bardey is often sought out to evaluate people who have committed horrible deeds, like Andrew Goldstein, who pushed Kendra Webdale to her death in front of a subway train last year.</p>
        <p>''I shook his hands a bunch of times,'' Dr. Bardey said. It hardly means that he applauded what Mr. Goldstein did. ''It's just polite,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Besides, he added, ''The best way to get somebody to reveal his true colors is to engage him.'' Shaking hands is one way to do that.</p>
        <p>''Arafat is, for better or worse, a representative of certain individuals, and if you want to deal with Middle East problems, you have to deal with him,'' Dr. Bardey said. ''It doesn't necessarily imply agreement with him.''</p>
        <p>THE same may be said about a perfunctory kiss, he said, as did other experts, who suggested that Americans might try breaking their habit of assuming that the rest of the world does whatever Americans do. There are, duh, such things as cultural differences.</p>
        <p>''We're not that physical a culture,'' said Dr. Kenneth Skodnek, chairman of the department of psychology and psychiatry at Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow, N.Y. But in much of the world, including the Middle East, a peck on the cheek is a routine courtesy, not an intimacy. ''Perhaps we overstate the importance of certain kinds of physical contact in other cultures,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Roger E. Axtell agreed. He is the author of ''Gestures: The Do's and Taboos of Body Language Around the World'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons). ''It all depends on where you are, and in many places the handshake and the kiss are both pretty benign,'' Mr. Axtell said.</p>
        <p>Speaking of different cultures, he added, members of some central African tribes spit at one another's feet as a form of greeting. ''That's one the politicians might like to start,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Funny. In the New York Senate race, they seem to be doing that already.</p>
