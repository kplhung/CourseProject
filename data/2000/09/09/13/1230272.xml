        <p>Attacked from all sides, United States Representative Michael P.

        <p>Mr. Forbes, of Quogue, acknowledged last night that his race against Regina Seltzer, 71, of Bellport, a longtime Democrat, was too close to call. With Republicans clinging to a narrow majority in the House, both national and state party officials had channeled money and advertising into the district early on to sway even Democrats to vote against the man who infuriated the Republicans by switching parties in 1999.

        <p>Attacked from all sides, United States Representative Michael P. Forbes, a Republican turned Democrat from Long Island, was locked in a dead-even struggle with his primary challenger last night and was one of the few incumbents who did not easily prevail in contests that were unusually rancorous.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes, of Quogue, acknowledged last night that his race against Regina Seltzer, 71, of Bellport, a longtime Democrat, was too close to call. With Republicans clinging to a narrow majority in the House, both national and state party officials had channeled money and advertising into the district early on to sway even Democrats to vote against the man who infuriated the Republicans by switching parties in 1999. In a telephone interview from Washington late last night, Mr. Forbes sounded resigned to whatever the outcome was, saying that his adoptive party voters ''had a hard time accepting that Mike Forbes embraced the same values they do,'' especially his fiscal conservatism and his opposition to abortion.</p>
        <p>This primary election was also the first in which the name of a first lady was on the ballot, with Hillary Rodham Clinton easily winning the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate against Mark S. McMahon, a little-known Manhattan orthopedic surgeon.</p>
        <p>With 98 percent of the vote counted, Mrs. Clinton received 82 percent of the vote, and Dr. McMahon received 18 percent. Aides to Mrs. Clinton's Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, had forecast that Mrs. Clinton would be viewed as a particularly weak contender for the November general election if her opponent in the Democratic primary received 30 percent of the vote. Still, Dr. McMahon's showing suggested that Mrs. Clinton must contend with a group of Democratic voters who dislike her.</p>
        <p>With the exception of the Congressional primary on Long Island, yesterday's races drew a light voter turnout and produced decisive victories for several incumbent members of Congress and for most incumbents in the State Legislature, according to  unofficial returns reported by The Associated Press. Connecticut also held primaries in several state legislative races, with most incumbents surviving except in Bridgeport, where State Representative Hector Diaz lost to his challenger, Felipe Reinoso, a charter school principal.</p>
        <p>In the Bronx, United States Representative Eliot L. Engel survived a vigorous challenge from State Senator Larry B. Seabrook in a fierce, racially charged contest. It also exposed potential weaknesses in the party machine of Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic Party chairman, who stunned traditional politicians by declining to endorse the incumbent. Instead, he embraced Mr. Seabrook in a bid to ensure black voters' support in next year's mayoral race.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the Democratic chairman suffered a huge setback with defeats in four of the five races in which the party had invested its resources.</p>
        <p>In another highly charged race that produced tensions between American-born and Caribbean Brooklynites, United States Representative Major R. Owens withstood a challenge from Una Clarke, a Jamaican-born city councilwoman who was once a protegee of the congressman. In her campaign, Ms. Clarke made specific appeals to the growing Caribbean community in that central Brooklyn Congressional district.</p>
        <p>''I feel relieved and triumphant,'' Mr. Owens said after a victory celebration last night. ''I feel indebted to the great common sense of my constituents and their appreciation of what I have done over the years. Their support refuted all the lies that have been told during the campaign that I had not achieved anything of significance over all these years. In a time of crisis, the people came through.''</p>
        <p>Also in Brooklyn, Representative Anthony D. Weiner won a resounding victory in a race against City Councilman Noach Dear, by a ratio of roughly 3 to 1. And United States Representative Edolphus Towns, an 18-year incumbent, won renomination, following a strong challenge by Barry Ford Jr., a Harvard-educated lawyer who opposed the Brooklyn congressman two years ago.</p>
        <p>The race between Mr. Owens and Ms. Clarke proved to be one of the most divisive of this season. Mr. Owens had asserted that his opponent, a longtime City Council member, was trying to bait voters along ethnic lines.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Clarke based her campaign on the theme that Mr. Owens had been ineffective in his 18 years in Congress and had grown increasingly distant from the concerns of residents. During their campaign, Mr. Owens invoked Hitler's name to describe her techniques in pitting one community against another.</p>
        <p>The fight portended another fateful event in the city, one that is  causing rifts along many fault lines -- the imposition of term limits for two-thirds of the City Council members next year. In this case, Mr. Owens and Ms. Clarke had socialized and supported each other's campaigns until Ms. Clarke made her  candidacy official. The congressman  cast her campaign as a desperate attempt to find an elective office once she faces term limits next year.</p>
        <p>While the race between Representative Towns and his challenger, Mr.  Ford, was not as personal, it was nonetheless a high-pitched competition. Mr. Ford had picked up the support of a number of officials, including Public Advocate Mark Green and former Mayor David N. Dinkins.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Towns, who received barely more than 50 percent of the vote in the 1998 race, this year assembled a much more formidable campaign and invested a lot more of his time --  and raised more money. The 66-year-old congressman was seen throughout the district in this year's campaign, working, by his own admission, more feverishly than in the earlier campaign.</p>
        <p>On Long Island, Mr. Lazio's seat in the Second Congressional District forced primaries all around.</p>
        <p>Steve J. Israel of the Huntington Town Council narrowly won the Democratic Party nomination for the seat in unofficial returns. Mr. Israel will face Joan B. Johnson, the Islip town clerk. Mrs. Johnson, of Central Islip, won the Republican primary yesterday and is seeking to become the first black Republican woman in Congress. She has had the backing of the Republican Party, with the national chairman, Jim Nicholson, helping her campaign just last week.</p>
        <p>Republicans hold a slight edge in voter registration in the district, but because some political analysts regard the seat as being up for grabs, the election is likely to receive national attention from both parties.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Forbes's race, Ms. Seltzer, a lawyer who served from 1976 to 1980 on the Brookhaven Town Board, campaigned vigorously, although she was outspent by Mr. Forbes. Ms. Seltzer stressed that, although Mr. Forbes became a Democrat, he continued to cast his votes with the Republican majority in the House on tax bills.</p>
        <p>She also stressed her support of a woman's right to choose abortion while highlighting Mr. Forbes's opposition to the procedure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes maintained that he has  remained the same fiscal conservative he always was and that he would continue to guard the environment, balance the budget and reduce taxes.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's primaries also included third-party candidates in the Senate race. The Independence Party, New York's arm of the national Reform Party, fielded two candidates, and Jeff Graham, the former mayor of Watertown, emerged victorious. The Green Party offered up three candidates, and its winner won't be known for several days because it was forced to use paper ballots in the city. Its candidates were Al Lewis, formerly known as ''Grandpa'' on ''The Munsters''; Ronnie Dugger, founding editor of the Texas Observer; and Mark Dunau, an organic farmer.</p>
        <p>On the Right-to-Life line, Louis Wein, a Republican, was in a dead heat with John Adefope, a telephone company engineer, for that nomination. With nearly all precincts reporting, the race was too close to call.</p>
        <p>Primary day began in Chappaqua with votes by Mrs. Clinton and her husband at the Douglas G. Grafflin Elementary School in their new hometown. The two arrived at 7:15 a.m. to a waiting throng of photographers and reporters to cast their votes in the sole voting booth in the school's lobby.</p>
        <p>After signing photographs and shaking hands with residents outside the school lobby, Mrs. Clinton went into the aqua blue booth first, followed by her husband. Asked afterward how it felt to see Mrs. Clinton on the ballot for the first time, President Clinton said: ''It was a thrill. After all these years of her helping me, it was a thrill. I loved it.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was more demure, saying only that it felt ''great'' to vote for herself. But later, talking to reporters at a nearby delicatessen, she elaborated somewhat on the occasion. ''I stood there for a minute,'' she said, ''staring at my name.''</p>
