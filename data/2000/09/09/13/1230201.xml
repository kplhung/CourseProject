        <p>Political Advice, Centuries Old</p>
        <p>Shakespeare was probably the last thing on the minds of HARVEY WEINSTEIN, BARRY DILLER, RICHARD HOLBROOKE, GEORGE PLIMPTON, TOM BROKAW, LIAM NEESON and DIANE SAWYER on Monday night as they drank cocktails in TINA BROWN's garden. Although Ms. Brown gave the party to honor RALPH FIENNES, who is appearing in two Shakespeare dramas at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the conversation veered toward politics, not plays.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Fiennes was dishing out political counsel. After all, in addition to ''Richard II,'' he is performing in ''Coriolanus,'' the political tragedy about an aristocratic Roman soldier whose arrogance and pathological need for his mother's approval lead to his early death. The only inkling of warmth and humanity in Coriolanus's soul comes from his enthusiastic and public expression of love for his wife.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fiennes's advice? He told KARENNA GORE SCHIFF that she should bring her father, Al Gore, to see the play, because it is ''a great tutorial for power.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Schiff smiled politely and said she'd think about it.</p>
        <p>Main Course With Manuscript</p>
        <p>Location can be everything in publishing, too.</p>
        <p>STEVE MILLINGTON is the maitre d'hotel at Michael's, the West 55th Street lunch spot of choice for the publishing crowd. Some of the city's most prominent magazine editors, book editors and agents depend on him for their tables.</p>
        <p>Well, Mr. Millington and his wife, MEREDITH, had one of those New York experiences recently. To boil it down: their much beloved African gray parrot went on the lam in Riverside Park,  and after great turmoil she was recaptured.</p>
        <p>Mr. Millington wrote a six-page precis and started asking his restaurant clients if they would mind taking a look. Thus far the likes of DAVID HIRSCHEY of Harper Collins, ESTHER NEWBURG of I.C.M., ALICE MAYHEW of Simon &amp; Schuster and MAER ROSHAN of New York magazine have all read it.</p>
        <p>Mostly they suggested he make it a children's story.</p>
        <p>He said that surprisingly, not a single editor or agent had refused to read the piece. And if they had, would they find themselves at a table, say, near the bathroom?</p>
        <p>''It would never cross my mind to do that,'' Mr. Millington said. ''I am not pushing it on anyone, I do it just in passing. I want them to look at it very much in a coaching direction.''</p>
        <p>Some Howls For the Mayor</p>
        <p>Watch out, David Letterman. MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI may be out to steal one of your trademark routines.</p>
        <p>At least he seemed to be trying yesterday as, microphone in hand, he offered reporters and his top aides a Live From City Hall version of Mr. Letterman's Stupid Pet Tricks.</p>
        <p>Ten dogs and a cat shared a stage in the ornate former Board of Estimates chambers, with each guest offered a chance to sing -- or perhaps more accurately to howl -- a tune.</p>
        <p>There was Buddy, a Chihuahua-terrier mix from Raleigh, N.C., who howled along to ''New York, New York.'' Lewis, a Welsh terrier from Winnipeg, Manitoba, gave his own gravelly version of Neil Young's ''Unknown Legend.'' Greta, a boxer from St. Petersburg, Fla., briefly brought ''Cats'' back to the stage in New York, offering a melancholy whimper to accompany ''Memory,'' which her owner played on a flute.</p>
        <p>The mayor, strolling around the stage with a certain bravado and a Letterman-like smirk, passed out pet snacks.</p>
        <p>''This is a like a session of the City Council,'' the mayor said after one less-than-tuneful dog melody, evoking groans and nervous laughter from his aides.</p>
        <p>The pets were in town to compete for North America's Best Singing Pet Title, a promotional contest sponsored by Advantage, a flea-control product. A winner at the competition today at South Street Seaport will get the chance to audition for an Advantage advertising campaign.</p>
        <p>The mayor, in case you were wondering, did not sing.</p>
