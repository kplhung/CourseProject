        <p>Facing a deadline Friday to come up with a plan to solve Nassau County's budget crisis, top county officials said today that they had agreed on more than $90 million of the roughly $140 million in budget cuts and new revenue they need to balance next year's budget.</p>
        <p>The three major sides in county government -- the Democrats who control the county Legislature, the Republican legislative minority and the Republican county executive, Thomas S.

        <p>Facing a deadline Friday to come up with a plan to solve Nassau County's budget crisis, top county officials said today that they had agreed on more than $90 million of the roughly $140 million in budget cuts and new revenue they need to balance next year's budget.</p>
        <p>The three major sides in county government -- the Democrats who control the county Legislature, the Republican legislative minority and the Republican county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta -- emerged from a closed meeting with members of the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, known as NIFA, vowing that they can still solve the county's budget problems together, without outside intervention.</p>
        <p>They cited the $90 million in cuts as proof of progress, but the differing assessments by Mr. Gulotta and the legislators indicate how far apart they are in their spending priorities as they try to settle the rest of the gap by Friday.</p>
        <p>The officials face two tasks, trimming $140 million from the 2001 budget and coming up with a balanced four-year budget plan. The county charter requires that Mr. Gulotta must submit a balanced budget by Sept. 15, and the NIFA board requires him to have a four-year plan ready then as well. It also wants the Legislature to pass a 2001 budget by mid-October and threatens to take over the finances if the county fails to balance its books.</p>
        <p>After the 2 p.m. meeting in Uniondale with Frank G. Zarb, the NIFA chairman, and others, Mr. Gulotta was more confident than the legislators, as he has been in the past, and said no one expects his budget Friday to be the final word.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the expectations of NIFA are that there will be a document on Friday that has every t crossed and every i dotted and that all of the parties agree to every element,'' Mr. Gulotta said. ''There clearly is a legislative process that has to take place.''</p>
        <p>Both Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the presiding officer of the county Legislature, and Peter J. Schmitt, the leader of the Republican minority, said they would wait for Mr. Gulotta's 2001 budget and four-year plan on Friday and then let the process unfold.</p>
        <p>''We've got concerns and yet there are some positives,'' Ms. Jacobs said. But, she said, it will be very difficult to cut the remaining $50 million in time.</p>
        <p>For example, the Democrats would like more detail on Mr. Gulotta's contract proposals for the county police, county detectives and county correction officers, as well as a cost analysis of the double-digit raises the proposals include. They want more detail about the effects of Mr. Gulotta's plan to lay off more than 350 county employees and about the early retirements of more than 300 others. And they say they are waiting for more detail about the effects of cutting $2.6 million from the county subsidy to the new Public Benefit Corporation, which provides health services to county residents.</p>
        <p>''We have our work cut out for us,'' Ms. Jacobs said. ''We have a short window, but I don't consider it a fatal problem.''</p>
        <p>Among the things the legislators have already agreed on is placing a $1.50 surcharge on tickets for such things as sports games, shows or circuses in county arenas. That fee, which is expected to bring in $590,000 this year and nearly $3 million in 2001, was passed unanimously Monday by the Legislature.</p>
        <p>Legislative committees will hold budget hearings on Sept. 25, Sept. 28 and Oct. 2, Ms. Jacobs said. After that, the full Legislature will hold a hearing on the budget, which must be passed by the week of Oct. 16 to meet Mr. Zarb's mandate, she said.</p>
        <p>After the meeting, Mr. Gulotta vowed to present a balanced 2001 budget and four-year plan on Friday. Although he was optimistic, he could not be specific about how he would apply the revenue from his proposed 4 percent property tax increase. Nor could he say which employees would be laid off or how much his proposed contract agreements with county police and correction officers would cost.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Schmitt expressed concern that Mr. Gulotta's outlook was too positive, saying, ''If the county executive is painting a rosy picture of the fiscal condition of this county as we speak today, then the county executive has got a fuzzy grip on reality.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Gulotta said difficult policy issues remained, like whether to freeze the subsidy to Long Island Bus at 2000 levels. But he said he remained confident.</p>
