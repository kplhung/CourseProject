        <p>''Dancer in the Dark,'' Lars von Trier's fable about a single mother and factory worker who is losing her sight, will open the 38th New York Film Festival, which runs Sept. 22 through Oct. 9. The winner of the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes film festival, the film stars the pop singer Bjork, who also wrote the score, and features Catherine Deneuve as her best friend and co-worker and David Morse as a policeman and her landlord.</p>
        <p>The festival, presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, will screen 36 features and shorts from 22 countries. Among the offerings are 10 works by Asian filmmakers, including the closing night film, ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' directed by Ang Lee.  The film centers on legendary martial-arts heroes, with action sequences staged by Yuen Wo-Ping, the fight choreographer for ''The Matrix.''</p>
        <p>Also included are Wong Kar-wai's ''In the Mood for Love,'' a romantic idyll set in Hong Kong in 1962 about two married people who discover their spouses are having an affair with each other; Edward Yang's ''Yi Yi'' (''A One and a Two''), about a middle-aged businessman going through a personal and professional crisis; ''Chunhyang,'' Im Kwon Taek's romantic 18th-century tale about the outlawed love between the beautiful daughter of a former courtesan and the haughty son of the provincial governor; and ''Brother,'' the first film made in the United States by Japan's reigning master of the gangster film, Takeshi Kitano. He stars under his stage name, Beat Takeshi, as an organized-crime member who moves to Los Angeles and earns the unwanted attention of the local mafia.</p>
        <p>The festival's centerpiece, to be shown on Sept. 30 and Oct. 1, is ''Pollock,'' a long-planned film about the artist. Directing for the first time, the actor Ed Harris leads a cast that includes Val Kilmer as Willem de Kooning, Jeffrey Tambor as the critic Clement Greenberg and Marcia Gay Harden as Lee Krasner, Pollock's wife.</p>
