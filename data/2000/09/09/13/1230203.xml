        <p>The National Football League released a fascinating little nugget of information today: the average margin of victory so far this season is 9.93 points, the lowest since 1970.</p>
        <p>The Jets are certainly doing their part to help set a record. With two come-from-behind nail-biters already behind them, the Jets left Giants Stadium early this morning still floating on the adrenaline high that a victory -- no matter how close and no matter how many weaknesses it may expose -- is good enough.</p>
        <p>''When you play in a game like this, and you win it, it means a lot,'' safety Victor Green said. ''It's only the second game of this season, but it makes sure you're off to a good start and it gives you so much confidence. Our team showed tonight a kind of resolve you don't always see. It took full advantage of the fact that the game is four quarters, not three and a half.''</p>
        <p>Good thing for the Jets. Their defense, particularly in the red zone, was superb; the Patriots were limited to four field goals through the first three periods, and then were thwarted on two late fourth-quarter drives that could have won the game. But the Jets' offense needed a warm-up so long that an old jalopy could have gotten revved up and taken out of the garage.</p>
        <p>Quarterback Vinny Testaverde was still showing the rust from his scant preseason work, struggling through the first three quarters, just as he did against the Green Bay Packers in the season opener. In the first three quarters of both games, he is a combined 25 or 62 for 272 yards.</p>
        <p>But in the fourth quarter of the first two games, Testaverde has completed a total of 14 of 19 passes for 270 yards. Three of his four touchdown passes this season have come in the fourth quarter. His quarterback rating for the first three quarters: 45.9. His fourth quarter rating: 155.2.</p>
        <p>The Jets were stymied early by the mix of defenses devised by Bill Belichick, the Patriots' coach who used to be the Jets' assistant head coach. He would send a pass rush at Testaverde and then drop six defenders back into coverage. The Jets had only 143 yards total offense at halftime and went three-and-out on four drives before the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Another drive ended after only one first down and yet another ended quickly when Testaverde was intercepted by cornerback Antonio Langham. And because the Jets were so frequently in unfavorable down and distance situations, the role of Curtis Martin and the running game was diminished. He ran 11 times for 47 yards.</p>
        <p>But the Jets found fourth-quarter success against Belichick's defense when they sent four or five players wide, leaving the backfield empty and spreading the defense. They used the versatile back Richie Anderson on the first drive of the fourth quarter, completing five passes to Anderson, all for first downs. That drive ended with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Wayne Chrebet that went through the hands of Langham, who should have had an interception.</p>
        <p>On the Jets' second touchdown drive of the fourth quarter, Testaverde completed a 44-yard pass to Dedric Ward before throwing a 28-yard touchdown to Chrebet, who stretched and leaned his body into the end zone before falling down. Chrebet, who has shown so far that he has the big-play capability that his former teammate Keyshawn Johnson said he lacked, fought through double-teaming for much of the game.</p>
        <p>''This win showed the character and heart of our team,'' Testaverde said. ''The Patriots were good at mixing their defenses and making the night tough on us. In the end, we spread things out a little bit and took advantage of their defense underneath.''</p>
        <p>Groh claims to be unconcerned about Testaverde's slow starts.</p>
        <p>''Not with the kind of throws he's made in fourth quarters, he wouldn't be rusty,'' Groh said. ''He's just missed them. Jordan missed some shots, too.''</p>
        <p>But as thrilling as the Jets' two victories have been -- the team is 2-0 for the first time since 1994 -- they have come against teams that are both 0-2 so far this season with two new coaches.</p>
        <p>The Jets play Buffalo and Tampa Bay in the next two weeks, so the level of competition is about to increase markedly. And while the Jets have shown a revitalized pass rush, sacking the Patriots' Drew Bledsoe six times, the two victories have also featured an offense that sputters before it starts and a woeful special teams.</p>
        <p>''It would be nice to dream there would be a smooth level of efficiency throughout the game,'' Groh said. ''Our two games have been this way. It really comes in spurts, good and bad for each side. You've got to be able to weather those.''</p>
        <p>Still, with the Jets now poised to play the Bills for the early lead in the division, Groh seems content to gamble with a stress-inducing offense, a punishing defense and an awe-inspiring level of resiliency.</p>
        <p>''Get used to it,'' Groh said. ''If you want to have a good record, with so many teams, the ability to win is about the same. Record doesn't depend on superiority. I said I liked our team because they have competitive toughness about them. You have to know that before you play. I thought we had some tests at the start of camp. Maybe it wasn't always what everybody else wanted to do. Maybe it was structured so the coach could find out some things.''</p>
