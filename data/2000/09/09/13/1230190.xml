        <p>Nearly a century ago, the House of Morgan and its founder, J. Pierpont Morgan, preserved the American financial system in the midst of a widespread panic.</p>
        <p>But despite the best efforts of the bank that bears J. P. Morgan's name, in recent years it could not preserve itself.</p>
        <p>Over the last 20 years J. P. Morgan  has undergone a remarkable renovation, infusing what had become a sleepy bank devoted simply to lending money to big governments and corporations with the pioneering spirit of the House of Morgan. Morgan was the first modern American commercial bank to break out of the restrictions imposed on banking in the 1930's during the Depression, becoming a contender on Wall Street by underwriting stock offerings and advising on gigantic mergers.</p>
        <p>But as much as the company strained to reclaim its former glory, it was not able to find a comfortable position in the modern financial world. So Morgan put itself on the block, talking with a number of banks around the world before reaching a deal to be acquired by the Chase Manhattan Bank for about $31 billion.</p>
        <p>In the end, analysts said, Morgan's downfall may be that it tried too hard to remain what its founder had built -- a behind-the-scenes adviser to the richest and most powerful, with a driven but insular culture. It shied away from the wave of banking mergers so prevalent in recent years. And Morgan found it had become an anachronism in a financial world dominated by mass rather than class.</p>
        <p>''Nobody like them is succeeding,'' said Alden Toevs, an executive vice president of the First Manhattan Consulting Group. ''The companies they are competing with are just much bigger in terms of capital and product lines.''</p>
        <p>Morgan is not alone. In just the last two months, two other midsize Wall Street firms -- Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and PaineWebber -- also agreed to be bought, both by huge diversified Swiss banks.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, J. P. Morgan is giving up its independence only a year after its biggest regulatory burden -- the Glass-Steagall Act -- was lifted. Passed in 1933, the law separated commercial and investment banking and forced the Morgan Stanley brokerage firm to be split from J. P. Morgan.</p>
        <p>Through the 1970's, the Morgan bank was content to lend money to big governments and corporations and to manage the assets of the heirs to the fortunes of the turn-of-the-century robber barons and other wealthy individuals. But as its big corporate borrowers were able to raise money directly by issuing stocks and bonds, the company realized its traditional business was wasting away.</p>
        <p>Given the choice of changing its clients or changing its products, declared its former chairman, Lewis Preston, in the 1980's, J. P. Morgan should offer its existing clients the ability to trade securities and agree to underwrite their financial offerings. This set in motion a 20-year game of cat and mouse with Congress and the banking regulators as Morgan found more and more regulatory loopholes that allowed it to act more and more like a brokerage firm. Indeed, when Congress finally repealed Glass-Steagall last year, Morgan had already become much more like its old partner, Morgan Stanley, than a traditional commercial bank.</p>
        <p>But repeal freed Morgan's competitors to go after its business, even as it accelerated the mergers among its rivals. Morgan executives, in the bank's exhaustively deliberate style, studied and stewed over myriad possible combinations, but never were willing to dilute what they saw as the company's unique culture and heritage.</p>
        <p>''This was the last bank on Wall Street that wanted to surrender its independence, and in retrospect this proved to be a real handicap,'' said Ron Chernow, the author of ''The House of Morgan,'' the definitive history of the bank. ''The other commercial banks weren't hampered by a sense of tradition and were able to grow at greater speed.''</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, Mr. Chernow noted, Morgan had the highest stock market value of any bank in the country. Now its value is one-tenth of the biggest, Citigroup.</p>
        <p>The financial world is increasingly dominated by two kinds of institutions. On one side are investment banking powerhouses -- Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch, perhaps Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank -- that manage the raising of capital, brokering of mergers and trading of anything with a price. Competition in this business is so intense that even successful second-tier players are choosing to sell to larger rivals.</p>
        <p>The second sort of giant that has evolved out of the commercial banks are financial conglomerates that sell all manner of investments, loans, deposits and insurance. The archetype of this company is now Citigroup, which incorporates Morgan's longtime rival Citibank, along with the Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney brokerage firms and the Travelers Insurance company. And the corporate ancestor of the entire conglomerate is the antithesis of everything Morgan: the Commercial Credit Corporation, which began by lending money to lower-income people before it was transformed into a global leader by the driven deal making of its leader, Sanford I. Weill.</p>
        <p>While Morgan has managed to crack the the top 10 in annual score cards of underwriting and advisory deals, it has never been able to climb to the very top where the bulk of the profits are earned.</p>
        <p>Morgan in some ways was trapped by its earlier success doing business with tycoons and Fortune 500 companies, Mr. Chernow said, and could not take advantage of the burgeoning markets managing the money of main street America.</p>
        <p>''They felt their competitive advantage was to trade on the romanticism and illustrious tradition that no one could match,'' Mr. Chernow said. ''But when the entire world of Wall Street was going down market, they felt that by lessening their standards they would water down their mystique.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, Morgan's focus on the very largest corporate customers left it with little involvement in the most dynamic sector of the economy recently, small technology companies.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Morgan has tried to address these flaws with modest efforts. It started an Internet business meant to serve the affluent rather than the truly wealthy. And it tried to get involved in financing Internet companies. But the results have been mixed. One of Morgan's most prominent Internet deals was the financing of Boo.com, an ambitious attempt to create a global Web site selling women's sportswear. Morgan helped Boo gain investments from some of the most wealthy families in Europe, but after running through $135 million, Boo was liquidated earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Morgan is now likely to see itself become a part of Chase, an agglomeration of banks that had hardly been in its league. To be sure, some of the ancestors of the current Chase have their own storied histories. The Bank of Manhattan Company, after all, was founded in 1799 as a water company. And Chase in the 1970's, run by David Rockefeller, was a leading banker to the Arab world. But the institution now using the Chase name was formed when two underperforming New York banks -- Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover -- merged in 1991 as a way to preserve capital drained by a decade of overindulgent lending. In 1995, what was then called Chemical bought Chase, which itself was struggling to meet profit goals. Chemical was clearly in control but took the more prestigious name.</p>
        <p>''They have a history of making acquisitions and integrating them successfully; that is enviable in an industry that has not done this well,'' Mr. Toevs said. Still, Chase, with its extensive branches and wide-ranging clientele, relies on a corporate culture drawn more from the streets of New York than of the rarefied air breathed by those at Morgan.</p>
        <p>''The Morgan folks are always wearing their elite status on their sleeves,'' Mr. Toevs said. ''That's got to help the Chase franchise.''</p>
