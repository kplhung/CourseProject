        <p>Representative Michael P. Forbes -- the former Republican who drew national attention by switching parties last year -- trailed by 39 votes out of nearly 12,000 cast in unofficial primary returns last night for the Democratic line in November's general election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes, a three-term congressman representing the East End of Long Island, faced the prospect of a stunning upset by a little-known but scrappy challenger, Regina Seltzer, who had campaigned as ''the real Democrat.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Seltzer, 71, is a retired school librarian and former town councilwoman who entered law school at age 50. Using the kitchen of her Bellport, N.Y., home as an office, she handles pro bono cases for environmental groups.</p>
        <p>''We're declaring victory,'' she said last night from her house, which was full of well-wishers. ''We are just absolutely ecstatic.''</p>
        <p>But the final outcome could hinge on recounts, absentee paper ballots and legal challenges.</p>
        <p>Representative Forbes, 48, of Quogue, who in the afternoon had expressed confidence that he would win the primary as he returned to Washington for legislative votes, demanded last night that the voting machines be impounded to verify the numbers.</p>
        <p>But if the preliminary results hold up, he said in a telephone interview: ''Then it's the will of the people. I have no regrets.''</p>
        <p>If Ms. Seltzer is the nominee, he said, ''I will support her'' and work hard for the entire Democratic slate.</p>
        <p>With all precincts reporting in the 1st Congressional District, unofficial returns at the Suffolk County Board of Elections gave Ms. Seltzer 5,825 votes, to Mr. Forbes's 5,786, a virtual dead heat.</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Forbes survives the primary, his chances in the general election would be gravely damaged.</p>
        <p>Although few politicians had expected Ms. Seltzer to win, they were watching her totals as a barometer of how much resistance Mr. Forbes would encounter in November from Democrats rebelling at his political midlife conversion, said Alan Eysen, a political consultant.</p>
        <p>The final Democratic victor will face a formidable Republican nominee, Felix J. Grucci Jr., supervisor of Brookhaven Town, who also has the Conservative, Independence and Right to Life Party lines.</p>
        <p>The adjoining 2nd Congressional District was also one of the mostly closely watched races.</p>
        <p>There primary voters chose the Republican and Democratic candidates who will face off in November to succeed Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican incumbent who drew national attention by forgoing a re-election bid to run for the United States Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>With all precincts reporting, the unofficial returns gave 5,735 votes, or 44.5 percent, to Steven J. Israel, the majority leader of the Huntington Town Council. A Suffolk County legislator, David A. Bishop, had 5,368 votes, or 41.6 percent, and Ghenya B. Grant, a Wyandanch library board president, trailed in third place with 1,790 votes, or 13.9 percent.</p>
        <p>The 2nd District is a political swing district. On the Republican side, the party's official nominee, Joan B. Johnson, the town clerk of Islip, defeated Robert T. Walsh. But she suffered a setback in the Conservative Party primary, losing to Richard N. Thompson.</p>
        <p>With both major national parties scrambling for control of Congress, hard-fought campaigns are being waged in both districts for the November finals. The Republicans cling to a narrow margin among the nation's 435 districts; the Democrats need to take only a handful of seats to capture a majority. The two districts on Long Island could prove pivotal.</p>
        <p>''There's no question these are nationally targeted races,'' said a spokesman for the Suffolk Democratic Party, Bradford W. O'Hearn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's decision to leave Congress made his district one of the country's 34 ''open'' seats, with no incumbent candidate. Anchored in the thickly populated, blue-collar South Shore suburbs of western Suffolk, it is considered a ''fair fight'' district and has tipped both ways in the past.</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson's campaign to succeed Mr. Lazio has already propelled her onto the national stage as well. She was among the minority speakers featured at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Victory in November would make her the country's first black Republican woman in Congress.</p>
        <p>In the 1st District, Mr. Forbes's startling party conversion had come with the encouragement of top Democrats, all the way to President Clinton.</p>
        <p>But that political about-face enraged Republican leaders, who called Mr. Forbes a ''hypocrite'' and a ''weirdo.'' They even released an old campaign tape outtake of Mr. Forbes kidding around by cupping a hand under his armpit and making flatulence noises.</p>
        <p>Seeking more serious revenge, the Republicans tried to undermine Mr. Forbes with mailings to Democratic primary voters portraying him as an archconservative opposed to abortion rights and gun control. They also described him as a loyalist ''who stood by Newt Gingrich 100 percent.''</p>
        <p>In fact, although Mr. Forbes was an early Gingrich ally, he was also the first Republican congressman to risk publicly breaking with Speaker Gingrich, in an early failed coup. Mr. Forbes's voting record was more moderate than the Republicans' party line, and he forged ties with labor unions.</p>
        <p>Representative Forbes said last night that considering Ms. Seltzer's limited resources: ''The Republicans' meddling in the Democratic primary obviously had an impact. But we're all big boys and girls.''</p>
        <p>The 1st District has a solid 3-to-2 enrollment ratio of Republicans over Democrats but has occasionally elected Democrats to various offices. The district stretches over the eastern two-thirds of Suffolk, embracing middle-income suburbs, dwindling farmland and the fabled estates of the East End.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes first won the seat in 1994 by upsetting the longtime Democratic incumbent, Thomas Downey.</p>
        <p>In her underdog challenge, Ms. Seltzer charged that Mr. Forbes had ''only changed his registration,'' not his philosophy. Her forces won a court ruling halting state Democratic Party ads that they said illegally interfered in the primary by helping Mr. Forbes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grucci, 47, of East Patchogue, heads the government of Brookhaven, the large town that dominates Suffolk in acreage, population and political power. He is better known outside Brookhaven as the president of his family business, Fireworks by Grucci.</p>
        <p>''We're going to have fireworks of a different sort when I unseat Mike Forbes,'' Mr. Grucci said.</p>
        <p>But his business could become a liability. Democrats are running a television ad displaying a news report that says health inspectors are testing soil samples to see whether the fireworks factory is the source of the toxic contamination of 11 nearby drinking water wells -- a sensitive environmental issue. Mr. Grucci has denied that his company is the source of the pollution.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PRIMARY: LONG ISLAND  Correction:  September 14, 2000, Thursday  An article in some copies yesterday about a vote that favored Regina Seltzer in the race against Representative Michael P. Forbes in the Democratic primary in the First Congressional District on Long Island misidentified the incumbent Congressman who was defeated in 1994 by Mr. Forbes. He was George J. Hochbrueckner; Thomas J. Downey was defeated by Rick A. Lazio in the Second Congressional District in 1992.</p>
