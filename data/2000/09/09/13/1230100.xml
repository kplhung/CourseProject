        <p>WILFRED KEAN is famous for his dill pickles, but on one particular day last fall, he couldn't make them by himself.</p>
        <p>Wilfred, 86, is my neighbor at our weekend place in Equinunk, a fleck of a town overlooking the Delaware River in the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania. He had called me over, so I followed him into his comfortable kitchen, with its flowered linoleum floor, sparkling white stove and porcelain sink, all of which his wife, Grace, keeps immaculate. Grace is also mindful of her pantry, stocking it with so many sugary items that my daughter always manages a visit, even though Wilfred's gravelly voice and teasing manner scare the daylights out of her.</p>
        <p>In the kitchen, Wilfred stood stooped at the sink, his arthritic hands as gnarled as ginger root, his body not cooperating, leaving him unable to stand for too long. ''Hold them like this, Delsey,'' he instructed, mispronouncing my name, as he has for 12 years, as he showed me how to scrub the small black warts off one of his Kirby cucumbers, of which, I noticed, there were a bucketful. Inwardly I sighed, aware that the many tasks on my own to-do list were about to be slighted in this venture. Still, I was drawn to the job. I had rinsed many cucumbers, but never scrubbed. I was curious, too, about the makings of these pickles.</p>
        <p>He handed me a small plastic brush, and I picked up the first cucumber and whisked away, removing every black knob. Then I looked down at the bucket and realized I had to pace myself better if I was to last at the sink.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Wilfred sat down at the kitchen table and mumbled through a monologue about how no one helped him pick the cucumbers in his garden but how everyone wanted his pickles, about the bald eagles he'd seen nesting on the Delaware last winter and about the virtues of sweet pickles, which he makes occasionally. ''Can't write the recipe down,'' he said. ''A recipe ain't worth the woof.''</p>
        <p>Although I was swamped with cukes, Wilfred's dill pickles were worth it: crunchy on the outside, firm on the inside and snappy with garlic, they lived far beyond the pale of any other pickles I had ever known.</p>
        <p>With the cucumbers washed and Wilfred pleased with my efforts, we prepared the brine: water, cider vinegar, sugar and canning salt, all boiled in a big pot. I looked at the recipe written in Grace's girlish cursive on notepaper, thinking I would be able to recall it by memory when I got back to the city, but it drifted out of my head, just as my grandmother's recipe for lemon cake with lemon icing had died with her 25 years earlier.</p>
        <p>The brine heating up, we started to pack two gallon-size jars. At the bottom Wilfred dropped a handful of dill, and then threw in a bunch of chopped white onions as I sliced a garlic pod on top. Next came the cucumbers.</p>
        <p>''Start with the smallest ones,'' Wilfred said. ''Then put the ones that look pregnant in the next layer. You can slice the ones that are too big -- just put them facedown. Put the curve side against the jar. Don't leave any gaps. Fill the middle with the tiny ones. There you go.''</p>
        <p>The jar was now two-thirds full -- time to insert more dill, onions and garlic. It was hard for Wilfred to stick his hand in the jar, so I put the dill in for him, though he managed the onions, dropping some on the floor.</p>
        <p>As time ticked away, I fleetingly wondered what was happening across the lawn in my own house. It had been ages since I had lingered in any kitchen, and though this had felt self-indulgent at first, it now felt totally right. Wasn't I old enough to dawdle? How long did I have to wait? My 80's? The last time I had spent so many hours in a kitchen was probably the summer of 1963, when as a young girl I stayed with my grandmother in her bungalow in New Jersey. Day after day, I'd watch as she stirred her cake batters, popped the pans in the oven and sat down to a good, hot cup of tea despite an indoor temperature of 90.</p>
        <p>''I can't get any more cucumbers in here,'' I complained to Wilfred, slightly annoyed that he expected me to find space where there was none.</p>
        <p>''Oh, come on, there's plenty of room,'' he grumbled as I searched for possible victims. ''Pack them in. You don't want a jar of floating cucumbers, do you?''</p>
        <p>The brine had been boiling a few minutes. I asked Wilfred again how he made sweet pickles. ''By guess and by God,'' he said, waving his hand but elaborating. ''You use four times as much sugar than in dill pickles. You got to go with your taste. The brine must be sweet but still quite sour.''</p>
        <p>''Who gave you these recipes?'' I prodded some more. I knew Wilfred had grown up on a farm, had even worked his own a few years before he switched to construction and ended up on a state road crew. ''Delsey, you know these recipes are from a hundred years ago,'' Wilfred chastised, putting an end to my query.</p>
        <p>We put the packed jars in a plastic basin and ladled the hot brine in, sure to fill every cranny. We then threw in a teaspoon of mustard seed -- to keep the pickles fresh longer -- and let the pickles set before topping them off with more brine. The pickles would need to stay refrigerated over the months it took to eat them.</p>
        <p>The last steps -- leaving the jars out until they cooled down before refrigerating them -- I left to Wilfred. The afternoon had nearly vanished, and I could see my husband approaching Wilfred's house, a weary look in his eye.</p>
        <p>We made the pickles with Wilfred another time. Grace helped, and my husband prepared the brine. ''He was afraid you wouldn't do it right,'' Wilfred said jokingly, trying to catch me off guard. As we took a noontime break, my daughter and I sat with Wilfred under his carport, as he hand-fed a chipmunk.</p>
        <p>He told a story about the white swans that swam in the Delaware within view of our houses, how a mother had laid her tail down flat and her babies walked right up it onto her back and they all floated away. How nice, I mused -- much like a day making pickles.</p>
        <p>DILL PICKLES  Adapted from Wilfred Kean  Time: 45 minutes, plus 24 hours' marinating and refrigerating</p>
        <p>2 cups cider vinegar</p>
        <p>1/3 cup sugar</p>
        <p>1/3 cup noniodized salt or canning salt</p>
        <p>1/2 cup (packed) fresh dill  3 white onions, peeled and chopped  3 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced  3 1/2 to 4 pounds small Kirby cucumbers, well scrubbed (to fill 1-gallon jar)  1 teaspoon mustard or celery seed.</p>
        <p>1. Sterilize 1-gallon glass jar and lid by immersing in boiling water for 10 minutes. Remove from water, and set aside.</p>
        <p>2. In large enameled, glass or other nonreactive saucepan, combine 6 cups water with the cider vinegar, sugar and salt. Bring to boil, reduce heat to low and then simmer mixture while proceeding with recipe.</p>
        <p>3. Place a third of the dill in bottom of jar. Top with a third each of the onion and garlic. Starting with smallest cucumbers, pack 1 layer horizontally over garlic. Place another layer crosswise over first. Continue until jar is two-thirds full, packing jar tightly and filling gaps with cucumbers halved lengthwise.</p>
        <p>4. Add another third of the dill, followed by another third each of onion and garlic. Top with cucumbers, packing tightly. Top with remaining dill, onion and garlic.</p>
        <p>5. Place jar in large plastic basin and carefully pour hot vinegar mixture (brine) into jar to fill it completely. Using a long wooden skewer, gently nudge the cucumbers deep in the jar to dislodge any air bubbles. Add more brine, if necessary, and allow to sit 5 minutes. Add more brine to fill the jar to the brim, and top with mustard seed. If using glass lid, place lid directly on jar. If using metal lid, to prevent corrosion place large piece of wax paper over top of jar before fastening lid.</p>
        <p>6. Let mixture cool to room temperature. Remove jar from basin, and wipe clean with damp sponge. Refrigerate jar at least 24 hours before eating. The pickles may be refrigerated for up to a year.</p>
        <p>Yield: 20 to 25 pickles.</p>
