        <p>Striking public school teachers here continued to defy a judge's back-to-work order and mounting anger from parents and students today as they pushed the state's seventh-largest school district into its second week of a strike over salary issues.</p>
        <p>Nearly five hours of bargaining in this blue-collar suburb of Trenton ended today just after midnight with only glacial movement on the central money issues. According to the teachers' union, the Hamilton Board of Education increased its wage offer over three years to 12.55 percent from 12.5 percent, an increase that the union, the Hamilton Education Association, said would amount to an extra dime a day on average. The strikers say they are the lowest-paid teachers in Mercer County and want a 14.7 percent increase over the same period. They have been without a contract since June.</p>

        <p>Striking public school teachers here continued to defy a judge's back-to-work order and mounting anger from parents and students today as they pushed the state's seventh-largest school district into its second week of a strike over salary issues.</p>
        <p>Nearly five hours of bargaining in this blue-collar suburb of Trenton ended today just after midnight with only glacial movement on the central money issues. According to the teachers' union, the Hamilton Board of Education increased its wage offer over three years to 12.55 percent from 12.5 percent, an increase that the union, the Hamilton Education Association, said would amount to an extra dime a day on average. The strikers say they are the lowest-paid teachers in Mercer County and want a 14.7 percent increase over the same period. They have been without a contract since June.</p>
        <p>''That offer was received by the members as the insult it was,'' said Steve Wollmer, a spokesman for the New Jersey Education Association, the state union that is assisting the local union. Talks were scheduled to resume tonight in Plainsboro.</p>
        <p>Teacher strikes are illegal under New Jersey law, and the teachers were ordered back to work last Wednesday by a State Superior Court judge, Anthony J. Parrillo, under threat of contempt. On Monday, Judge Parrillo began imposing cumulative daily fines of $100,000 on the union and $300 on each of the district's 1,000 certified teachers.</p>
        <p>But nobody in the union believes that large sums will ever have to be paid. Jersey City teachers defied a back-to-work order in 1998 and were fined $500,000, but the amount was reduced to $300,000 and converted into a union donation to a scholarship fund, Mr. Wollman said. Arnold M. Mellk, the union lawyer, added that state law forbids fines that are ruinous or force a person or institution into bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the only school buses that rolled through Hamilton's streets today were for parochial schools, and Neil A. Bencivengo, the superintendent of schools, was among only a handful of staff members still working at district headquarters. He has met with a stream of angry parents and worried students, especially high school seniors worried about college admissions and the prospect of the lost strike days being made up next summer. The district has 13,000 students.</p>
        <p>There has been only one other strike in the 32 years that Carol Chiacchio, assistant superintendent, has worked in the district, and that one, in 1980, lasted only a day. The current strike began the day after Labor Day, when teachers were supposed to report for work. Classes were to begin last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bencivengo said: ''I think it's important for people to know that we have an outstanding teaching staff, and that the current Board of Education is more pro-educator than any in memory. And that just makes it that much more frustrating to me that it isn't settled.''</p>
        <p>There have been sporadic protests by parents against the strikers.</p>
        <p>''They deserve more money,'' said Tara Vacha, an eighth grader, ''but they're not the ones who are going to get double homework when we have to make this up.''</p>
        <p>Other students organized e-mail protests. ''How many of you are sick of this teacher strike?'' one message began. ''As this strike continues, all the sports teams may suffer because of forfeits to other teams not involved in a teachers strike. The seniors may even have their graduation pushed back.''</p>
        <p>The teachers contend that they have not been treated fairly by a penny-pinching school board. Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Education Association, said starting teachers at Hamilton are paid an annual salary of $30,321, which rises to a maximum of $54,000 after 13 years. She said that while  teachers in other Mercer County towns start at about the same level, their top salaries are as high as $89,000.</p>
        <p>In addition, Ms. Joseph said, the teachers have returned to work on the last four September opening days without contracts. ''You have a lot of history here building up and building up, and finally the members said, 'Enough,' '' she said.</p>
