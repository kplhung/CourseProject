        <p>The number of new freshmen in the senior colleges at the City University of New York this fall has risen by 5 percent, and at some campuses by more than 20 percent, according to preliminary figures provided by the university.</p>
        <p>The increase, the first in five years, comes despite predictions that CUNY's new policy of ending remedial instruction at CUNY's senior colleges would cut sharply into enrollment. This is the first year that the new policy is being applied on some campuses.</p>
        <p>CUNY officials attributed the gain to better-educated applicants, more aggressive recruiting efforts and their efforts to rebuild CUNY's image. They said that students who might once have rejected CUNY as a remedial factory were now seeking admission and that 87 percent of the applicants -- up from 80 percent a year ago -- were able to pass the entrance examinations.</p>
        <p>''This increase shows that the reputation of the university has improved and is attracting more and better students,'' said Louise Mirrer, CUNY's vice chancellor for academic affairs.</p>
        <p>But there were more skeptical explanations as well.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the faculty union said they feared that CUNY was bending its admissions guidelines to fill seats, and taking in unprepared students whom it could no longer serve well, and that the numbers did not reveal  whether minority students were being squeezed out of the senior colleges.</p>
        <p>''A large number of students came in at the last minute, and the first question is who these students are and whether they are prepared,'' said Steven London, the first vice president of the faculty and staff union, the Professional Staff Congress.</p>
        <p>He said that many of the students who signed up at on-the-spot recruiting drives were admitted without providing academic or financial records. ''How many of these students will be here in a month or two, I don't know,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On at least one campus, Brooklyn College, where freshman enrollment rose by 24 percent, there was a sharp increase in the number of students admitted through its SEEK program for economically and educationally disadvantaged students who do not meet the college's regular entrance criteria. (SEEK stands for Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge.)</p>
        <p>While the SEEK students will not be taking remedial classes, their academic background is considered roughly equivalent to those admitted as remedial students in previous years. SEEK is mandated by the State Legislature. About two-thirds of the increase in Brooklyn's freshmen enrollment (to 1,315 from 1,057 last year) can be attributed to the increase in SEEK students.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Mirrer maintained that an improvement in CUNY's rigor and reputation was responsible for the increased enrollment. She said that at the senior colleges, which have been raising their own entrance requirements in recent years, more students were arriving with stronger high school records.</p>
        <p>She said that the number of students with four or more years of high school English, for example, had risen by 10 percent to 11,381 this year, while those with three or more years of college preparatory mathematics had climbed 6 percent, to 11,132. At the same time, she said, the number of students with grade point averages of 80 or higher (10,739) had risen by 6 percent.</p>
        <p>She said that CUNY did not yet have data about the racial and ethnic composition of the incoming class and could not say yet whether it had changed since last year.</p>
        <p>The increase in freshmen helped stabilize CUNY's overall enrollment, which has fallen since 1994, when it reached a recent peak of 212,634 students. Total enrollment late last week was 195,620, up three-tenths of 1 percent from last year. CUNY officials expect to revise the figures when they take their formal student census next month, but do not expect the trends to change.</p>
        <p>''People are beginning to think of CUNY as not the school of last resort,'' said Larry Edwards, the liaison between CUNY and the Board of Education and deputy to both chancellors. ''It's all perception, and perceptions are beginning to change.''</p>
        <p>Bernard Sohmer, president of the university faculty senate, said he expected the enrollment figures to be slightly lower in October when the formal student census occurs, but expected that the freshmen totals would still show gains.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the increase will turn out to be 5 percent, but I do think something positive has happened,'' he said. ''There seems to be a turnaround.''</p>
        <p>Many public universities, including the State University of New York, have shown enrollment gains in recent years as a college degree has become more important to earn a decent salary.</p>
        <p>Tuition is $3,200 a year at CUNY's senior colleges, compared with $3,400 at SUNY. A SUNY spokesman said he did not yet have data on enrollments for this year, but that the number of freshmen at SUNY's four-year colleges grew 4 percent (to 29,007) last year.</p>
        <p>CUNY began to lose enrollment in 1994, as it struggled with cutbacks in its state aid and growing attacks from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki and its own board members, including Herman Badillo -- now the chairman -- who asserted that the education it offered was second-rate.</p>
        <p>''There was a lot of rancor and negativity,'' said Matthew Goldstein, CUNY's chancellor.</p>
        <p>He said that CUNY lost students when it imposed a one-year limit on remedial work at the senior colleges in 1995; he also said it lost more than 20,000 students on public assistance when the city began to require welfare recipients to work.</p>
        <p>In 1998, CUNY's trustees voted to stop admitting any remedial students to the senior colleges. Under its new policy, students who cannot demonstrate their readiness for college-level English and math may not enroll in bachelor's degree programs, but may enroll in the two-year community college programs. To demonstrate they do not need remediation, they have to either pass CUNY's own placement tests or show that they scored at least 75 on the English and math Regents or at least 480 out of 800 on each of the math and verbal sections of the College Board's SAT tests.</p>
        <p>The new policy took effect on 7 of CUNY's 11 senior college campuses this year, and will take effect at the others next year.</p>
        <p>Nearly all the colleges where the new policy is in effect showed increases in freshmen this year, many of them sizable. Baruch College showed an increase of 15 percent. Queens College was up 10 percent. Brooklyn was up 24 percent, including its bigger population of SEEK students.</p>
        <p>Although the number of Hunter College freshmen declined by 3.6 percent this year, campus officials said they had to turn away applicants because their total enrollment had climbed.</p>
        <p>''We could not accommodate any more freshmen,'' said Evangelos J. Gizis, the college's acting president.</p>
        <p>Baruch College, too, said it shut its door to eligible transfer students seeking to enter its business program in early July because its classes were full.</p>
        <p>''People working on Wall Street are knocking on our doors,'' said Jim Murphy, Baruch's executive director for admissions and financial aid.</p>
        <p>He said that the college, which admits all eligible applicants, not only admitted more freshmen this year (2,992, up from 2,623 last year), but a slightly higher percent of those accepted for admission actually enrolled. He said the average combined College Board scores for the new students were 1,060, up 7 points from last year and up 50 points from 1997. A third of the freshmen had scores of 1,150 or higher.</p>
        <p>At City College, where the new policy does not take effect until next year, freshmen enrollments are up 29 percent. Zeev Dagan, the college's provost, said he thought much of the increase resulted from improved services and recruitment.</p>
        <p>''When we got our lists of admits, we started calling students, and we offered placement tests every weekend,'' he said. ''They didn't even have to make an appointment.''</p>
        <p>More than 25,000 students have enrolled at CUNY as freshmen this year, up 5.4 percent from last year. The number jumped about 5 percent at both the four-year colleges and the community colleges.</p>
        <p>Not all the colleges had increases in their freshmen classes. Besides Hunter, New York City Technical College, Lehman College and Medgar Evers all saw declines, ranging from 4 percent at New York City Tech to 18 percent at Medgar Evers.</p>
        <p>Ricardo R. Fernandez, president at Lehman, said he and his staff were still trying to determine the reasons for the 12 percent decline in incoming freshmen. He said one question was whether the number of of high school graduates in the Bronx had changed now that students have to pass Regents exams to graduate.</p>
        <p>Edison Jackson, Medgar Evers's president, said that the college had received many late registrants after the preliminary figures were gathered last week and that he now expected to show a 10 percent increase in freshmen.</p>
        <p>''The average age of our students is 34,'' he said, ''They have to get their kids into school first, and then they come to us.''</p>
