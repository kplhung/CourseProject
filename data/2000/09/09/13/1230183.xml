        <p>Indiana University tried to look to the future yesterday, naming Mike Davis as the interim head basketball coach of the Hoosiers.</p>
        <p>While Davis accepted his ascension from assistant to Bob Knight to successor to the controversial coach, it was clear from the remarks at Davis's news conference and from a nationally televised interview with Knight, that it will take a while to chip away at the Knight legacy in Bloomington.</p>
        <p>Knight, who was fired on Sunday after 28 years as head coach at Indiana, spoke on ESPN last night, defending his behavior at the school, particularly since the administration put him on ''zero tolerance'' notice on May 15, and admitting that he had overstayed his welcome.</p>
        <p>''I thought I would stay here and coach until I was done coaching, which I'm certainly not now,'' Knight said during the ESPN interview. ''I'm not done coaching. But in recent years things have changed, the administration changed, the athletic department changed. For some people that may be good. For me, it wasn't.</p>
        <p>''As recently as July I gave serious consideration to another job, and have in the last couple of years. I don't think that my thinking about another job quite overrode the feeling that I had for Indiana University and the kids we had here, the kids we had coming, what we had built. I wanted more than anything to see us get back. We've never been mediocre. always been really good or pretty good. I wanted to see us get back to really good. I kind of hung onto that thought for four or five years.</p>
        <p>Knight added: ''Probably I should have gone somewhere else. There's someone who's a better fit for these people and administration as a basketball coach. And there would be a place somewhere that's a better fit for me as a basketball coach than Indiana is right now.''</p>
        <p>He said he was not embarrassed to leave Indiana the way he did.</p>
        <p>''Not at all,'' Knight insisted. ''What I am is proud, proud of what our basketball program turned out.''</p>
        <p>Knight denied committing any of the violations that were detailed on Sunday by the university's president, Myles Brand.</p>
        <p>And he said he would definitely coach somewhere else.</p>
        <p>''I spent all summer with an offensive set in my mind while I'm fishing or traveling, thinking who's going to be here or there,'' he said. ''Now I won't be able to do that with these kids. But I'm looking for kids that I can do it with. I haven't retired. I'm an unemployed teacher now, looking for a place to teach. There are too many things I have yet to explore about game of basketball.''</p>
        <p>He said he had already received calls inquiring about his interest.</p>
        <p>Davis, who was an assistant to Knight for three seasons, serving as the lead recruiter for this year's prize class and the man who recruited most of the players he inherits, now steps into the spotlight.</p>
        <p>While Knight no longer holds the entire state of Indiana in sway as he once did, he still had enough stature  to prompt protests on campus and a threatened walkout by nearly the entire team if Davis were not named as coach.</p>
        <p>But Davis, 39, who played at Alabama, then professionally in Europe and in the Continental Basketball Association, was named as interim head coach while another assistant, John Treloar, was named as interim associate head coach. The team stood behind Davis on the podium and expressed satisfaction.</p>
        <p>''Coach Knight is the reason I'm here, but Indiana basketball is bigger than anyone,'' Davis said. ''The players stood up for Coach Treloar and myself. I discussed the situation with their parents, and my son yesterday when I was leaving said, 'I hope you get the job.' I've gone to these kids homes and recruited them, convinced them to come here. They stood up for me, so there's no way I could turn it down.''</p>
        <p>''We definitely have something to prove,'' said the junior Dane Fife, who just one day earlier said he had already decided to leave. ''We've been through a lot, and we have to come out and beat people.''</p>
        <p>Speaking of Knight, Fife said: ''We owe it to him. This is his team. We're ready to go.''</p>
        <p>Davis said: ''I don't think there was pressure from the players. For Mike Davis to be head coach at Indiana University is a miracle. If it wasn't September, this program could go out and get a big-time coach.''</p>
