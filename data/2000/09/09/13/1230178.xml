        <p>A union between Chase Manhattan  and J. P. Morgan &amp; Company would probably mean the elimination of only a few jobs and free much-needed real estate space, people in the industry say.</p>
        <p>The deal ending the independence of J. P. Morgan, a storied New York firm that has built a strong reputation as an investment bank, would also probably mean the elimination of some jobs that are deemed to be duplicated after the merger.</p>
        <p>But, according to government officials in New York who had limited knowledge of the plans, the impact would be minimal, and the acquisition was likely to have a positive impact on New York's already tight real estate market.</p>
        <p>''Most of the consolidation will be at the higher levels and that banking talent will be redeployed because those people are quite resilient and skilled,'' said Mitchell Moss, a business professor at New York University, said, echoing the sentiments  government officials. ''And it will be very good for the New York real estate market, because it will open up space in a very tight market.''</p>
        <p>Government officials said that they were publicly taking a wait-and-see approach to the mergers of the two New York companies. But, privately, they said it would help strengthen the financial services industry in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moss said that the two companies have ''complementary strengths'' that will help a new company at a time when ''the financial services industry is increasingly one that is becoming more integrated'' and the lines between ''investment banks, retail banks and other banks'' were slowly being eliminated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moss added that in the end New York would ''benefit from being the home of the merged banks.''</p>
        <p>The overall impacts of any acquisition on the economy, job market and the real estate industry are still unclear, but local leaders seem to be taking a positive attitude.</p>
        <p>Carl Weisbrod, the president of the Downtown Alliance of New York, a group that represents businesses in the Wall Street area, said that the strength of a combined bank would help Manhattan solidify its international dominance in the financial services industry.</p>
        <p>''Consolidation in today's economic climate does not have as much of an impact as it would have several years ago,'' Mr. Weisbrod said. ''In a way, anything that is going to strengthen New York's role as the financial capital of the world is going to be encouraged, especially in this era of globalization.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weisbrod said that the areas of Manhattan where both companies have their offices are in dire need of available commercial real estate and that any job loses would be offset quickly in this market.</p>
        <p>''In the early 1980's, the consolidation of commercial banking did have an impact on occupancy rates on commercial real estate space and did contribute to the depression on Wall Street,'' he said. ''But Lower Manhattan's economy is going extremely well, people can find jobs, the growth of Silicon Alley has really diversified things.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moss, the New York University business professor, said that while some may worry about losing their jobs, few will be in a position to have to truly worry about finding employment. ''The important thing is that no matter what happens in any merger, New York is going to be the home of one of the largest banks in the world,'' Mr. Moss said. ''There will be a stronger, better bank in New York, as opposed to having two weaker ones.''</p>
