        <p>AS J. P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan captured the spotlight yesterday, a smaller proposed union signaled the passing of another era on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Wasserstein Perella &amp; Company is in advanced talks to be acquired by Dresdner Bank of Germany, said a person close to those discussions. If the two can come to terms on price -- said to be $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion -- a deal could be announced in three to five days, the person said.</p>
        <p>Such an agreement would end the renowned firm that embodied the swashbuckling style of deal making celebrated in the 1980's. It was then that Wall Street bankers were storied media stars, reveling in a world captivated by the rough-and-tumble business of hostile takeovers. Bruce Wasserstein, and his partner at the time, Joseph Perella, made their names at First Boston, which was later acquired by Credit Suisse. It seemed there was almost no deal without them, including Texaco's takeover of Getty Oil and the sale of the Beatrice Companies.</p>
        <p>In 1988, the two took a core of talented bankers with them and set up shop as Wasserstein Perella. From the start it was a dynamic team. Mr. Wasserstein, say colleagues, is a numbers whiz with the ability to map out the maneuvers of a hostile takeover from memory. He is a gruff, intimidating negotiator who earned the nickname Bid'Em Up Bruce for his ability to extract the highest price from a suitor. But his reputation suffered after the hostile takeover of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, when, according to the book ''Barbarians At the Gate'' he leaked crucial information to the press.</p>
        <p>For years, Mr. Wasserstein hoped to fashion himself after Felix Rohatyn, the well-appointed Lazard Freres deal maker who went on to become the United States ambassador to France, said one person who asked not to be identifited. Not surprisingly, Mr. Wasserstein had talked with Lazard in the past about acquiring the firm, but those talks faltered over price, said that person. Mr. Wasserstein did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perella was always the more affable of the two, a charismatic leader, liked by chief executives and staffers. But the partnership, which was so successful at First Boston, grew strained at Wasserstein Perella. In particular, the two clashed over the direction that their investment boutique would take and what private investments it would make.</p>
        <p>''Our marriage is a complex one,'' Mr. Perella told The Boston Globe in 1990. ''Sometimes you hate your wife. Sometimes you love her. The differences are often reconcilable.'' In this case, they were not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perella left Wasserstein in 1993 for Morgan Stanley, where he became a managing director in the investment banking department and was later named head of that division. Despite Mr. Perella's protests, former colleagues said, Mr. Wasserstein kept the Perella name on the door. Mr. Perella has thrived at Morgan, spending hours with clients and serving as a mentor to younger bankers there, leaving the day-to-day operations to a colleague, Terry Meguid.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wasserstein thrived, too. And indeed if Mr. Wasserstein's firm gets the astounding price being discussed for the investment advisory business, he could net as much as $750 million because he owns more than 50 percent of the company, a person close to the discussions said. The investment boutique is in a good position to negotiate, particularly because bankers there are very familiar with Dresdner's business. Wasserstein Perella helped advise Commerzbank A.G. of Germany on its failed merger with Dresdner. This is Dresdner's third try at a deal this year, having failed to close a planned merger with Deutsche Bank, too.</p>
        <p>If Dresdner's talks with Wasserstein -- talks reported yesterday by The Wall Street Journal -- bear fruit, the German bank will get a long-sought presence in the United States that it needs if it wants to compete on a global scale.</p>
        <p>''It is not just about mergers,'' said Richard Strauss, a Goldman, Sachs analyst. ''It is any business generated from those transactions to help them grow,'' like bond deals and initial public offerings of stock.</p>
        <p>One person involved in the talks said that Mr. Wasserstein would probably be named a vice chairman of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, while Frank Biondi, who is the chief executive of Wasserstein and who has been there since the beginning, would probably be co-head of investment banking with a Dresdner official.</p>
