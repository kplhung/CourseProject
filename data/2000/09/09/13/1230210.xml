        <p>Darryl Strawberry was at home in Tampa, Fla., yesterday, which is where he must remain for most of the next two years after being sentenced to house arrest for violating his probation by admittedly driving under the influence of medication and then leaving the scene of an accident on Monday.</p>
        <p>Strawberry, who is fighting colon cancer and whose career has been marred by substance-abuse suspensions, illnesses and criminal charges, was driving to see his probation officer on Monday. But Strawberry said that he blacked out from the prescription medication and hit a road sign, and then slammed into another vehicle.

        <p>Darryl Strawberry was at home in Tampa, Fla., yesterday, which is where he must remain for most of the next two years after being sentenced to house arrest for violating his probation by admittedly driving under the influence of medication and then leaving the scene of an accident on Monday.</p>
        <p>Strawberry, who is fighting colon cancer and whose career has been marred by substance-abuse suspensions, illnesses and criminal charges, was driving to see his probation officer on Monday. But Strawberry said that he blacked out from the prescription medication and hit a road sign, and then slammed into another vehicle. Strawberry apologized for his behavior when Judge Florence Foster sentenced him in court yesterday in Tampa.</p>
        <p>''I used the wrong judgment taking medication because I didn't feel well,'' Strawberry said in the courtroom. ''I just blacked out. I didn't know if I hurt anybody. I feel really bad about it.''</p>
        <p>Strawberry's wife, Charisse, who was teary-eyed outside the courthouse, said her husband was in a lot of pain because of his battle with cancer and the removal of his kidney last month. She added that he was relieved that the other driver was not injured. In a telephone interview after the Strawberrys returned home, Charisse Strawberry said that her husband is trying to cope with his latest ordeal.</p>
        <p>''He'll have to pick himself up from this and go on,'' she said. ''Hopefully, there will be a light under this dark cloud.''</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the house arrest, Strawberry can leave the house only for doctor's appointments or to go to work. If Strawberry ever wanted to return to baseball, said Robin Fuson, the assistant state attorney, he would need the court's permission. Fuson added that the 38-year-old Strawberry still faces misdemeanor charges for driving under the influence and leaving the scene of an accident, and he could receive additional punishment.</p>
        <p>''Two years of house arrest is no day at the beach,'' Fuson told The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>Most of the Yankees seemed bewildered by the latest twist in Strawberry's life. Dwight Gooden thought for about 30 seconds before saying that he would not know what to say to Strawberry. Derek Jeter, who plans to call Strawberry soon, compared the developments of his friend's life to a soap opera.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what you to say to him,'' Jeter said. ''I don't have a clue.''</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams said that it was ''obviously sad'' to see Strawberry arrested and that Strawberry's failure to ''maximize his talent'' was sad for baseball. Williams spoke  about Strawberry's uncertain future, a future that was already clouded by a recurrence of his cancer and a one-year suspension from baseball starting in April for drug and solicitation charges and will now include two years of house arrest.</p>
        <p>''He's still a fairly young person,'' Williams said. ''Maybe, if it's not baseball, he'll find his calling in society in some other aspect of life. I wish him the best. He's one of those warriors who won't give up. Hopefully, he'll be all right in those two years.''</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, the Yankee manager who had prostate cancer and who declined to discuss Strawberry on Monday, did not know of Strawberry's sentencing until reporters told him.</p>
        <p>''It's just sad,'' Torre said. ''You know he's not normal because he's got all this stuff going on, chemically, in his body. Unless we've experienced it, it's really tough to pass judgment. It's unfortunate that he keeps running into it.''</p>
        <p>Charisse Strawberry had told reporters at the courthouse that her husband was experiencing ''mental difficulties'' but refused to elaborate. During the phone interview, she explained that she meant that her husband has not been himself because of the pain from dealing with cancer and the derailing of his career.</p>
        <p>''I think it's just really tough to not be able to continue his career and then to have his second fight with cancer,'' Charisse Strawberry said. ''At 38, to have his second bout with cancer, that's tough.''</p>
        <p>Strawberry, who tested negative for alcohol in his system, volunteered a urine sample that will be tested for any nonprescription drugs in his system. He was fined $265 and his case will be reviewed in four months. If Strawberry abides by the conditions of his house arrest for a year, law enforcement officials said there is a chance the second year could be lessened to probation.</p>
        <p>''All I can say is, it's like what one of the reporters at court said to me today,'' Charisse Strawberry said. ''It was like Darryl was trying to do the right thing and it went bad.''</p>
