        <p>FOR months, Burger King has sought to stimulate flagging sales of its fast fare with a seductive appeal carrying the theme ''Got the urge?'' Yesterday, it was Burger King that had the urge -- the same old urge the company has had so often, to place the creative duties for its general market advertising account in review.</p>
        <p>The review, denied by the top Burger King marketing executive as recently as a month ago, involves assignments with billings estimated at $400 million. It began with an unusually frank dismissal of the recent work produced by the incumbent agency, the New York office of Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide. Lowe Lintas and two predecessors have created campaigns for Burger King since 1994 carrying themes like ''Get your burger's worth'' and ''It just tastes better'' as well as ''Got the urge?''</p>
        <p>''We're disappointed with the impact our advertising has had in driving sales,'' said Mikel Durham, the new North American president for the Burger King Corporation in Miami, part of Diageo P.L.C., ''and moving the indicators we track on the relationship of the consumer with the brand.''</p>
        <p>While Lowe Lintas is being invited to participate in the review, she added, the agency would be expected to offer a drastically new approach to the account.</p>
        <p>The fast-food category of the restaurant market ''is intensely competitive,'' Ms. Durham said, adding that it ''becomes harder and harder to stake out a point of differentiation and a 'share of throat,' if you will.''</p>
        <p>The review came as sales at Burger King stores in the United States open at least a year declined 0.4 percent for the 12 months ended June 30. That's worrisome to Ms. Durham, who was brought in a month ago from a sibling, Guinness in London, to help Diageo dress up Burger King for a planned stock offering.</p>
        <p>Her perspective on the industry is underscored by recent steps taken by other chains that compete against Burger King, the world's second-largest fast feeder. Taco Bell, a unit of Tricon Global Restaurants, dismissed its agency, the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>The agencies for two other fast-food advertisers -- KFC, also part of Tricon, and McDonald's -- have made substantial changes in the creative content of their campaigns. At the KFC agency, Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising in New York, the creative team was changed, too.</p>
        <p>Typically, comments like those by Ms. Durham mean that the incumbent stands a slim chance of retaining an account. That is particularly true for a restless marketer like Burger King, which has had four creative agencies since 1987 -- six if you count the two predecessor shops of Lowe Lintas that created ads from 1994 to 1999, Ammirati &amp; Puris and Ammirati Puris Lintas. Still, Lowe Lintas intends to take part in the review.</p>
        <p>''We've got the history, we've got the experience and we've certainly got the creative firepower to help them turn their business around,'' said Rob Quish, president at the New York office of Lowe Lintas, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>Lowe Lintas has not been having a good week. On Monday, another client, Sun Microsystems, left the agency, citing a conflict with the account of a second high-technology marketer, Dell Computer.</p>
        <p>And on Thursday, during the MTV Video Music Awards, the performer Kid Rock mocked Burger King commercials created by Lowe Lintas for a promotion featuring the Backstreet Boys by unfavorably comparing them with a similar promotion pairing a rival boy band, 'N Sync, with McDonald's.</p>
        <p>Asked her opinion of Kid Rock's humorous remarks, Ms. Durham was all business.</p>
        <p>''No comment,'' she replied.</p>
        <p>Ms. Durham declined to identify the other agencies being asked to take part in the review; speculation has already started that TBWA/ Chiat/Day may be one. She also declined to discuss whether an agency in San Francisco that has worked for two months on a project for Burger King, Odiorne Wilde Narraway &amp; Partners, would be considered.</p>
        <p>The hiring of Odiorne Wilde was a strong signal that Burger King was getting ready to flame-broil Lowe Lintas in addition to its hamburgers. While the company had been pleased with a campaign that ran from March 1996 to August 1999, which paired familiar rock and pop tunes with appetizing footage of Burger King menu items, subsequent work was less well received.</p>
        <p>Ms. Durham said that she hoped to complete the review by the end of the year and have a new campaign soon after. That fast-track timetable might favor Lowe Lintas because it may prove difficult for an agency of the size needed by Burger King to handle such a big assignment to mobilize so quickly.</p>
        <p>''Given the nature of Burger King's business and the challenges it is facing as a corporation,'' said Lee Garfinkel, chairman, chief executive and chief creative officer for the United States operations of Lowe Lintas, ''we understand new management's obligation to entertain new points of view relative to its advertising and marketing.''</p>
        <p>''We embrace this opportunity to look at the account from a fresh perspective,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Three other agencies will continue to handle other tasks for Burger King: MediaVest in New York, part of the Starcom MediaVest unit of the B Com3  Group, for media services; Uniworld in New York, 49 percent owned by the WPP Group, for campaigns aimed at black consumers; and Bromley, Aguilar &amp; Associates in San Antonio, also part of B Com3 , for ads aimed at Spanish-speaking consumers.</p>
