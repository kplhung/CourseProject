        <p>The MetroStars saw one of their goals for this season end last night when they were eliminated by the Miami Fusion, 3-2, in the semifinals of the United States Open Cup at Mitchel Field in Uniondale, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Goals by the Brazilian Welton and the Colombian Diego Serna two minutes apart 16 minutes into the second half made the difference before a crowd of 3,109.</p>
        <p>Andy Williams scored the first goal for the Fusion, in the 11th minute, and Billy Walsh tied it for the MetroStars in the 40th minute before Miami scored the two quick goals. Adolfo Valencia brought the MetroStars close with seven minutes left, but the team pressed in vain the rest of the way, missing two excellent chances to tie.</p>
        <p>Miami, which failed to make the playoffs in Major League Soccer, will face the Chicago Fire, another member of M.L.S., in the final, which will be staged Oct. 21 in Soldier Field, home of the Fire.</p>
        <p>Paul Grafer, the goalkeeper for the MetroStars, looked tentative in allowing Williams to beat him from about 30 yards away. Grafer was expecting a pass to the right side and got caught on the wrong side as Williams beat him to the lower left corner.</p>
        <p>It was the third game in 11 days for both teams, and the MetroStars will play another Friday, when they open their playoff series against the Dallas Burn at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>It is because of the crush imposed by competitions such as the U.S. Open Cup and international regional tournaments that M.L.S. yesterday announced a reduction next year in the number of regular-season games, from 32 games to 28.</p>
        <p>''It'll be less congestion and it'll allow our teams to be more active in international competitions,'' Ivan Gazidis, the league's executive vice president said.</p>
