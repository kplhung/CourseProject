        <p>LATELY, dealing with my corporate travel department is like being pecked to death by a duck,'' said a senior executive I know who travels over 100,000 miles a year on business and feels that he is being increasingly second-guessed by the bean counters when he tries to exercise some personal choice in his airline and hotel arrangements.</p>
        <p>The complaint is a common one. As business travel costs soar, many travel departments are revamping existing travel policies or drafting new ones -- and insisting on more strict adherence to them. ''The importance of compliance'' to these policies ''has increased significantly,'' according to the latest survey by American Express on business travel costs.</p>
        <p>By necessity, travel departments ''are becoming increasingly aggressive'' in keeping costs under control, said Rusty Carpenter, the vice president for American Express Consulting Services, which helps corporations manage travel and purchasing expenses.</p>
        <p>At many companies, travel departments now more than ever are dictating who you fly, what you drive, when you leave, where you stay and why you need to adhere to the rules.</p>
        <p>I'd like to hear from readers describing their experiences -- good or bad -- with new company travel policies. Meanwhile, let's give the travel departments their due and look at what they're facing.</p>
        <p>Companies in the United States spent about $185 billion on business travel last year, according to the Institute of Business Travel Management. That compares with $70 billion in 1982, when such costs were first tracked. Worldwide, about $396 billion is spent annually on business travel, according to Marianne McInerney, the executive director of the National Business Travel Association.</p>
        <p>The American Express survey, ''Trends and Forecasts for the Business Travel Industry: Preview 2001,'' estimates that business air fares, hotel rates and car rentals are all expected to rise at least 5 percent next year.</p>
        <p>Business air fares, which American Express said rose 8 percent in the second quarter compared with the 1999 period, are volatile. So it's difficult to predict that 5 percent is all they will rise next year. Major carriers recently increased fares, blaming fuel costs. The survey noted that proposed and potential mergers among carriers here and abroad can ''radically alter the competitive landscape of the airline industry,'' possibly leading to even higher fares.</p>
        <p>The average booked rates for hotels also rose 8 percent in the second quarter and is expected to increase 6 percent next year domestically and 3 percent internationally, American Express said. But prices are increasing more in high-demand business cities.</p>
        <p>But it's not just the room rates  adding up. The overall revenue that hotels generate per room rose 7.4 percent in the first four months of this year, as hotels have increasingly found ways to tack on extra charges for using the phone, raiding the mini-bar and other in-room services.</p>
        <p>''Gathering data on how much travelers are spending on these extra fees, above and beyond the room rate will give travel managers additional leverage'' in negotiating vendor deals, the American Express survey suggests.</p>
        <p>And there is growing pressure to book farther ahead and purchase cheaper, nonrefundable air tickets, which can cut 20 percent a year off air travel costs, Mr. Carpenter said.</p>
        <p>But he added, ''The catch is, the companies have to make sure to manage the process'' internally so that such tickets, which are typically good for one year, don't get forgotten about and become ''spoiled inventory'' when itineraries change, as they frequently do in business travel.</p>
        <p>All of which adds up to ''more creative'' corporate travel departments, Mr. Carpenter said, with greater responsibilities and more power to enforce compliance with policies, and even to go beyond traditional boundaries and have a bigger say in corporate procurement decisions on computers, cell phones and other technology.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, there was a tiny snippet of good news in the American Express survey. While business-class fares to Europe continue to rise, those to Asia and Australia fell 3 percent in the first quarter of this year.</p>
