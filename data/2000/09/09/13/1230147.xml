        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today that the United States would not use force to make Iraq allow the resumption of international arms inspections.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright, speaking with reporters after a speech to the opening session of the General Assembly, said there were still other ''red lines'' that Iraq would risk attack by crossing.

        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today that the United States would not use force to make Iraq allow the resumption of international arms inspections.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright, speaking with reporters after a speech to the opening session of the General Assembly, said there were still other ''red lines'' that Iraq would risk attack by crossing. ''We do not want to see them reconstitute their weapons of mass destruction,'' she said, ''and we don't want them to take action against the Kurds, and we don't want them to threaten the neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>But as for restarting arms inspections, Dr. Albright said, only President Saddam Hussein ''can pick up the key to let himself out of the sanctions box.'' She said Iraq had to allow a new inspection commission under Hans Blix, a Swedish arms control expert, to start work; otherwise, the sanctions imposed in 1990 after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait would never be lifted.</p>
        <p>Speaking to the General Assembly today, Dr. Albright urged member nations to ''stand up to the campaign launched by Baghdad against the U.N.'s authority and international law.''</p>
        <p>''We must continue to do all we can to ease the hardships faced by Iraq's people,'' she said. ''But we must also defend the integrity of this institution, our security and international law.''</p>
        <p>In answering questions from reporters, Dr. Albright said twice that force was not the answer to getting cooperation from President Hussein on arms inspections.</p>
        <p>Her statements signaled both to Iraq and to Council members that the United States would not raise the possibility of American force as the United Nations waits for the Iraqis to admit the new inspectors, who have been trained and are ready to go. That could come as a relief not only to Iraq, but also to those nations who say American threats can only complicate dealings with Mr. Hussein.</p>
        <p>''I think that basically we have made it clear that it is essential for Baghdad to live up to its obligations, and we are opposed to it, using force,'' she said. ''We have our red lines, and we have made those quite clear, and I think it is very important that somehow Saddam Hussein gets the message that he is the one out of step with the rest of the members.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright's remarks underscored the evolution in the administration's policy toward the use of force against Iraq. In December 1998, the United States and Britain conducted four nights of air strikes to punish Mr. Hussein's government for its refusal to cooperate with the previous team of inspectors. Since then, the administration has grown increasingly reluctant to consider force, even though some intelligence reports have noted worrisome signs that Iraq's weapons programs have continued.</p>
        <p>In Washington, officials said the use of force -- even the threat -- would undercut efforts to maintain an international consensus on keeping sanctions in place as long as Mr. Hussein resists new inspections. One official said the administration was prepared to accept Iraq's continued intransigence because that supports the American case.</p>
        <p>''What we have said is, we're not ready to use force to get the inspectors into Iraq,'' an administration official said today. ''That is not saying -- if we have any evidence he's trying to reconstitute weapons of mass destructions -- that we're not prepared to act.''</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, there has been a heightened sense of concern at the Pentagon and elsewhere in Washington that Iraq might be preparing to cross one of the ''red lines'' Dr. Albright spoke of today. Iraq's military has been conducting annual exercises, and intelligence officials have warned that some of the activity appeared to go beyond that of previous years, including unusual movements of armored weapons and aircraft, officials said.</p>
        <p>''I would say there is just enough to warrant the extra level of attention we're giving it,'' but not yet enough to prompt the administration to act, a senior administration official said on Friday. In 1996, similar exercises in Iraq culminated when Iraqi troops stormed into the Kurdish enclave in the north.</p>
        <p>The latest activity has prompted the Pentagon to put its forces on a heightened state of alert, including batteries of Patriot missiles based in Germany, which have been ordered to be ready to move quickly to Israel or other countries in the event of a confrontation with Iraq.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright's comments were not unexpected; diplomats at the United Nations say they believe that the Clinton administration does not want another confrontation in its waning months in office.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive economic embargo was imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Last December the Security Council, in creating the new Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, gave Iraq a plan under which sanctions could be suspended after a period of cooperation with inspectors on solving key disarmament tasks.</p>
        <p>Iraq says that the decade-long embargo has led to the deaths of a million people because of scarcities of food, medicine and other goods. Some American and European groups are campaigning to end sanctions.</p>
        <p>''While those groups may be well-meaning, they need to understand who the villain is,'' Dr. Albright said today. ''The villain is Saddam Hussein. It is very, very simple.''</p>
