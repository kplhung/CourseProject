        <p>In October, Marriott International will fire its second salvo in the nation's work-family conflict, opening a $2.5 million, 120-place day care center in a refitted historic building in downtown Washington.</p>
        <p>The company's first assault on employee child care problems -- a 24-hour day care center in Atlanta -- promised much when it opened in 1997 but delivered disappointing results. Now Marriott, having analyzed what went wrong, is prepared to try again, offering not just a refined version of company-sponsored child care but also insights for the many Americans who have wondered why, in one of the world's richest countries, it is so hard for companies to offer decent, affordable places for employees to put their children.</p>
        <p>Fewer than 10 percent of American businesses offer some form of child care assistance to employees, said Faith Wohl, president of the Child Care Action Campaign, and the assistance is usually limited to discounts and referral services. Nationwide, parents currently pay 60 cents of every dollar of child care, she added, while governments at all levels pay 39 cents, and the private sector -- both companies and tax-exempt philanthropies -- pays just a penny.</p>
        <p>Marriott, one of the few companies to experiment with child care on site, began monitoring the work-family travails of its staff early on. Almost 85 percent of its employees are wage earners who push room-service carts, haul luggage or answer phones deep into the night.</p>
        <p>Years before the current labor shortage made child care a hot-button workplace issue, Marriott discovered that these hourly employees were so overwhelmed with family chores that supervisors were essentially spending 25 to 50 percent of their time on social work.</p>
        <p>''They were doing everything from finding subsidized child care to driving people to doctors' appointments,'' said Donna Klein, Marriott's vice president for diversity and workplace effectiveness.</p>
        <p>Marriott was not dying to be in the day care business, she added, but its managers knew that if they ignored staff problems, they could badly tarnish the chain's reputation for customer service.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, Marriott sought a solution on the supply side: if working parents could not find day care, the thinking went, it must be because there were not enough places. So Marriott would build its own center, employees would put an end to jury-rigged dealings with aunties and grannies and women down the street, and productivity would surge.</p>
        <p>In Atlanta, Marriott's two downtown hotels, the Marriott Marquis and the Marriott Suites Midtown, formed a nonprofit partnership with two other hotels in the neighborhood and floated bonds to finance construction of a day care center.</p>
        <p>And not just any day care center. The Inn for Children, as the center was named, was to offer not only around-the-clock child care and early-learning programs, but a full range of social services as well: nutrition counseling, family-crisis referrals, dental screenings, a pediatric infirmary, credit counseling and even mammograms.</p>
        <p>On opening day, Atlanta's mayor cut a chain of paper dolls, and the local news media pronounced an end to the lodging industry's child care crisis. And then, to everyone's dismay, the children did not come.</p>
        <p>The cost was a big reason. To cover the interest on its construction bonds, the hotel partnership charged $110 to $135 for a 50-hour week of child care, depending on the child's age. That may have been on a par with other licensed centers in Atlanta, but it was out of the question for the wage-earning families the hotels wanted to assist. ''If you're making $25,000 a year, that's 25 percent of your income,'' Ms. Klein said.</p>
        <p>The hotels had expected the workers to make use of scholarships and state financial assistance to reduce their costs to as little as $25 a week. What they did not realize was that the wage earners' hectic lives left them little time to line up the aid.</p>
        <p>Employees working day shifts could not go across town to submit applications during business hours. Some did not have cars. Recent immigrants lacked required documents and could not read forms printed in English. And some employees had an aversion to going near any government office.</p>
        <p>Faced with running this gantlet, most employees stuck with the woman down the street.</p>
        <p>With slots going empty and debts to pay, the hotel partners opened the center to the children of nonemployees. Today, of the 250 mostly low-income children finger-painting and eating peanut butter sandwiches at the Inn for Children, only 25 are children of Marriott employees.</p>
        <p>The lesson in all this? The day care problem is not one of supply, but affordability, Ms. Klein said. If a company charges fees high enough to cover the cost, many employees will not be able to afford the service.</p>
        <p>So Marriott is using a different model for its Washington center. Instead of linking with peers from the private sector, it joined forces with the General Services Administration, which has operated day care centers since 1985, and the city of Washington. Instead of floating bonds, Marriott and the G.S.A. split $1.3 million in capital costs 50-50, and Washington granted $1 million to pay rent for seven years.</p>
        <p>The partners also lined up grants and scholarships from foundations and local businesses, so low-income families would not have to maneuver the state-aid bureaucracy. Community groups and Washington law firms offered pro bono legal work and managerial assistance.</p>
        <p>And this time, no one is saying the center will put an end to all employee child care woes.</p>
        <p>''If we could get, maybe, 30 Marriott children out of 120 places, we'd definitely look at it as a success,'' Ms. Klein said, noting that the chain has three hotels within a four-block radius of the center, with about 800 hourly workers. Government employees' children are expected to fill most of the other openings.</p>
        <p>But if the project succeeds, she said, it will be duplicated in other cities where Marriott has hotels, the federal government has employees and municipal financing is available.</p>
        <p>''Ten years ago, we thought, 'Oh, we can make a huge difference,' '' Ms. Klein said. ''But now, we realize that this is a systemic issue, which has to be solved, certainly, with business as a key player, but with public-policy involvement as well.''</p>
