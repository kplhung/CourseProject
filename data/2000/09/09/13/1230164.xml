        <p>The White House plans to declare on Wednesday that Japan has violated international whaling rules by expanding its whale hunt this year, and will start a process that could lead to economic sanctions against Japanese imports within two months,  Clinton administration officials said.</p>
        <p>A meeting in New York on Monday between Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Japan's foreign minister, Yohei Kono, failed to head off the start of the sanctions process, the officials said.</p>
        <p>In July, Japan began hunting small numbers of Bryde's and sperm whales in the North Pacific, saying that the whales would be harpooned for scientific research. Both species are protected under United States law, but scientific whaling -- as opposed to commercial -- is permitted under International Whaling Commission rules.</p>
        <p>During the last two months, the expanded hunt has turned into one of the largest confrontations between Tokyo and Washington since the trade disputes that marked President Clinton's first term. Mr. Clinton has complained about the whaling in letters to Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, and the United States has boycotted a United Nations meeting in Japan.</p>
        <p>Japanese officials charge that the move toward sanctions in Washington has been politically driven, reflecting an effort by Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, to rebuild strained relations with environmental groups.</p>
        <p>But standing up to the United States on whaling is good politics in Japan as well. Whale meat is still a delicacy at small restaurants dotting  Tokyo's back streets, often marinated with talk of how the United States is attempting to force Japan to adopt Western environmental rules without regard to local tradition.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration is betting that Japan will back down rather than risk sanctions in the midst of a presidential election. It is already drawing up lists of goods that could be banned, including many types of seafood. The hope is that publishing the list will result in enough panic among Japan's food exporters that whaling will be called off.</p>
        <p>Japanese officials say that if the United States proceeds to the next step, imposing sanctions, it will take the case to the World Trade Organization in Geneva. Trade lawyers say  the Japanese government might win because the United States imports no Japanese whale meat and therefore may not be able to impose sanctions for actions that take place beyond American borders.</p>
