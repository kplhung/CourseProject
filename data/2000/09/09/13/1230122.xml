        <p>The first Latin Grammy Awards show, tonight on CBS, will be the first multilingual broadcast on a major American network: the talk will be mostly in English and Spanish, the singing in Spanish and Portuguese. It is also the first time the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences has allowed recordings released outside the United States to be Grammy nominees.</p>
        <p>Modeled on the national academy's annual Grammy Awards, the Latin Grammys are decidedly international. Their debut at the Staples Center in Los Angeles is intended to celebrate the Latin music explosion in the United States and expose American viewers to the music of the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking worlds.</p>
        <p>''We want to make the Latin Grammys a touring event every year,'' said Mauricio Abaroa, senior vice president and executive director of the 2,600-member Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, an arm of the national group. The Latin academy, formed in 1997, is made up of voting members from 15 countries. ''This is an international project that will be a showcase for the music of the different countries,'' Mr. Abaroa said.</p>
        <p>In the future the show will be as likely to be staged in Buenos Aires or Rio de Janeiro as in the United States, the Latin academy said. Michael Greene, president of the national academy, said that Latin music was so diverse that he could envision separate Grammys for Mexico, Brazil and other Latin countries someday. ''The possibilities are endless,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In seeking to represent musical styles from Cuba to Argentina, the Latin Grammys have not made everyone happy. One record executive complained that separating the Latin Grammys from the regular awards would result in marginalizing them. There has also been criticism that regional Mexican music, one of the best-selling Latin styles in the United States, receives short shrift in terms of performances and presenters.</p>
        <p>In development for more than 10 years, the Latin Grammys were born of a sense that the eight Latin categories among the regular Grammys fell short of recognizing the growth and the diversity of Latin genres, national academy officials said. Latin music now represents about 5 percent of the overall United States music market, Recording Industry Association of America figures show, and in recent years has become one of its fastest-growing segments of that industry.</p>
        <p>The main Grammy awards are given in 98 categories; the Latin Grammys have 40, from record of the year and best new artist to best tango album and best Portuguese-language rock album. Some recording executives noted that unlike the regular Grammys, which sometimes resulted in odd choices for the Latin categories because voters included members unfamiliar with Latin genres, the Latin Grammy winners were voted on by industry professionals who know their music.</p>
        <p>With Jennifer Lopez, Jimmy Smits, Gloria Estefan and Andy Garcia as hosts, the banter on the show is expected to be bilingual, and winners may switch completely to their native language in acceptance speeches.</p>
        <p>''Is it a risk? Sure,'' said Jack Sussman, vice president for specials at CBS, which also broadcasts the Grammys. But Mr. Sussman, a former programming chief for MTV Latin America, said that the talent involved in the show and the potential for building a new annual franchise on the network outweighed concerns that English-speaking viewers would tune out. The Latin Grammy show, which will be seen in about 120 countries, is being produced by the same team that stages the main Grammys.</p>
        <p>The Latin Grammys are giving a platform to many of the Hispanic artists who have become household names in the United States singing in English. The scheduled performers include Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera as well as non-Latin guests like 'N Sync, which will sing with Son by Four, a Puerto Rican group.</p>
        <p>The criticism over marginalization and lack of Mexican representation became public when Gilberto Moreno, general manager of Fonovisa, a California company that releases regional Mexican recordings, said in an interview with the Los Angeles Spanish-language daily La Opinion that the performers to be featured in the show did not represent the Latin music movement in the United States and that the awards themselves separated Latin artists from the mainstream.</p>
        <p>If the national academy wants to recognize Latin music, Mr. Moreno said, it should expand the Latin categories in the main Grammys.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moreno, who did not return telephone calls to his office in Van Nuys, Calif., called the Latin Grammys ''a party between Emilio Estefan and Sony.'' Emilio Estefan Jr., the Miami producer and Sony executive, led the Latin Grammy field with six nominations and was honored on Monday as the Latin Academy's person of the year. Mr. Estefan has produced million-selling albums for the Miami Sound Machine and Gloria  Estefan, his wife. Fonovisa artists got a handful of nominations and none of them are scheduled to perform on the show.</p>
        <p>But the criticism underscored a wider sentiment among Mexican-Americans that regional Mexican music does not get the respect it deserves. Based in traditional music, it has roots on both sides of the border and extends from the brass-band bounce of banda music to accordion-driven norteno music, sometimes known as Tex-Mex in the United States. Guillermo Hernandez, director of the Chicano Studies Research Center at the University of California at Los Angeles, said that regional Mexican music was looked down upon in Mexico and the United States because it was associated with rural working-class people.</p>
        <p>''Mexican folk music, aside from being a curious, cute type of thing in some circles, has not really being recognized for its value,'' said Mr. Hernandez, whose center received $500,000 this year from Los Tigres del Norte, a norteno band, to promote the study and appreciation of the music. ''It's mostly ignorance.''</p>
        <p>But music critics note that the genre is hugely popular, reflecting the rapid growth of the Hispanic population in the United States. More than 60 percent of that population is of Mexican descent, and many are immigrants. While Latin pop artists have gotten most of the attention across the United States, regional Mexican music represents a large chunk of Latin sales, half or more by some estimates, and in areas of California and the Southwest it is as prevalent on Spanish-language radio as salsa is on the East Coast.</p>
        <p>The leader of Los Tigres del Norte, Jorge Hernandez, said that his band, which won a Grammy in 1988 and is nominated for a Latin Grammy, would not attend the ceremony because it would be performing in Colombia. But he said he supported the stance of Mr. Moreno and Fonovisa, his band's label for the last 11 years.</p>
        <p>''Our position is that our music should be respected and given its due,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the complaints is also a widespread feeling among Mexican-Americans that, even though they form a majority among Latinos in the United States, they are often underrepresented on Hispanic television and in other entertainment media in the country. Abraham Quintanilla Jr., a recording producer in Corpus Christi, Tex., and the father of the Tejano star Selena, said that Mexican-Americans were slighted both by ''the Caribbean people'' who predominate in entertainment centers like Miami and New York and the people of Mexico, many of whom resent Mexican-Americans for their Americanized ways.</p>
        <p>''We're treated like orphans,'' said Mr. Quintanilla, who said he planned to attend the Latin Grammys because his son, A. B. Quintanilla, and his band, Los Kumbia Kings, received a nomination.</p>
        <p>''What's wrong with a Tejano artist performing at the Latin Grammys?'' the elder Mr. Quintanilla asked. ''What does 'N Sync have to do with the Latin world? I don't understand that. That's my only gripe. I don't think it's balanced out.''</p>
        <p>Only one regional Mexican music performer, Alejandro Fernandez, who sings rancheras, is included among tonight's scheduled performers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abaroa of the Latin academy said that the criticism was unwarranted. He said that nominees were voted on by Latin academy members on the basis of excellence, not of recording sales or popularity. He noted that regional Mexican music had six Latin Grammy categories; only Brazilian music, with seven, had more. ''I'm Mexican, and I'm the first one to defend my music,'' he said. ''But this is not the Mexican Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. This is an international organization.''</p>
        <p>The controversy has left a sour taste among some Latin Grammy supporters. Sandra Guzman, editor in chief of Soloella.com, a Web site for Latinas, said she would be watching the show at a private party sponsored by El Diario-La Prensa, the New York newspaper; the magazine Urban Latino; and HBO Latino at the Copacabana in Manhattan. But she lamented: ''It shows we're not as inclusive as we should be as a community. It's not a Mexican issue, it's a Latin music issue. We should be better than that.''</p>
        <p>Some music critics said that the Latin Academy needed to reach out to the regional Mexican field to maintain its credibility.</p>
        <p>''The burden is on the organization to get a fair representation,'' said Ramiro Burr, a music critic for The San Antonio Express-News and author of ''The Billboard Guide to Tejano and Regional Mexican Music,''  published by Billboard Books. ''The truth of the matter is that the regional Mexican market is enormous, and it's beginning to overpower Latin pop and tropical salsa.''</p>
        <p>This is not the first bump the Latin Grammys have run into. Organizers had wanted to stage the show at the American Airlines Arena in Miami,  where many of the Latin artists and music labels are based. But a local law prohibited Miami-Dade County from dealing with companies and organizations that do business with Cuba, and the Latin Grammys include Cuban nominees like Los Van Van and members of the Buena Vista Social Club. (The law was rendered moot in July after a Supreme Court decision struck down a similar law in Massachusetts aimed at Myanmar and human rights abuses there.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Estefan, a Cuban exile, said that music and politics should not mix and that he would like the Latin Grammys to be held in Miami next year. As for his numerous Latin Grammy nominations as songwriter and producer, he said this was his lucky year, so much so that he doubted that such a showing could be replicated.</p>
        <p>''It's the kind of thing you can't plan,'' said Mr. Estefan, who has won seven Grammys.</p>
        <p>Mr. Estefan, who has his own record label in a joint venture with Sony Music Entertainment and is president of artist development worldwide for Sony, said that the  Latin Grammy Awards would be a special moment for him mostly because they confirm how far Latin music has come.</p>
        <p>''It used to be that people didn't want to hear Latin music or wanted you to change your last name,'' he said. The Latin Grammys offer proof, he said, that ''in order to be successful you have to be yourself.''</p>
