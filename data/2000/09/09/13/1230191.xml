        <p>John DiBiaggio, a Detroit-born dentist who has helped promote public service in higher education, yesterday announced his plans to retire as president of Tufts University in Medford, Mass.</p>
        <p>Dr. DiBiaggio, 68, has presided over the 8,500-student campus since 1992, and plans to remain until a successor is selected, or until June 2002. He previously served as president of Michigan State University and the University of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>During Dr. DiBiaggio's tenure, Tufts' endowment more than tripled, to $600 million from $180 million. Among the new initiatives is the College of Citizenship and Public Service, a university-wide push to integrate those values as core elements of the curriculum funded by a $10 million donation from Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay.</p>
