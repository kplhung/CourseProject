        <p>HEARD about the tequila shortage? It seems that because of a shortfall in the supply of agave plants, from which tequila is distilled, the demand for this liquor is exceeding the supply.</p>
        <p>But fear not, margarita lovers; plenty of tequila is still around, although in a twist, there is now less bad stuff.</p>
        <p>As tequila producers in Mexico wait for the supply of agave to rebound -- the plant takes eight years to mature -- they are cutting back on their least profitable products, the cheap, generic tequilas used primarily for slushy frozen margaritas, sugary house cocktails or for downing shots with lime and salt. Instead, the existing agave is being channeled into the higher-quality tequilas, which are generally more profitable.</p>
        <p>''The better tequilas haven't doubled and tripled in price -- they were charging top dollar for them already,'' said Al Lucero, author of ''The Great Margarita Book (Ten Speed Press, 1999) and an owner of Maria's New Mexican Kitchen in Santa Fe, which offers about 100 brands of tequila. ''The rotgut stuff was so bad that they were almost giving it away.''</p>
        <p>The rise in quality will be subtle. Replacing generic house tequilas with more expensive brands like, say, Jose Cuervo White, offers only marginal improvement, at a slightly higher price. For example, the classic margarita at Mi Cocina in Greenwich Village is now $7, up from $5.50. And it is irrelevant with frozen margaritas, which are so intensely sweet that you cannot taste the spirit anyway. Both branches of the Manhattan Chili Company in Midtown have replaced the cheap tequila in their frozen margaritas with cheap rum to create a ''rum-a-rita,'' not that you can tell the difference.</p>
        <p>''Most people who are connoisseurs aren't going to order the frozen anyhow,'' said Ken Kessler, an owner of the Manhattan Chili Company, which still uses tequila in its other margaritas.</p>
        <p>A classic margarita uses two parts tequila to one part Triple Sec and one part lime juice, served straight up with or without salt around the rim of the glass. A better grade of tequila may point to a day when the cocktail may be savored rather than slugged back. Anybody who orders a margarita with a better tequila, made of 100 percent agave juice rather than the 51 percent required in the cheaper tequilas, will discover a smoother, more complex cocktail that cushions the salty, mineral agave flavor of the tequila with the orange sweetness of Triple Sec and the sweet-sour edge of lime juice.</p>
        <p>Still, rising prices for tequila raise the question of why variations on the martini, using fine rum or vodka, haven't gone over.</p>
        <p>''The flavor of the agave is so distinct that it's hard to replicate it with anything else,'' said Mr. Lucero, who once made an Absolut margarita but saw it die on the menu. ''The popularity of tequila is so high that there's no reason to change the formula. Why fight success?''</p>
