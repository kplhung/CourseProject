        <p>An Unlikely Address</p>
        <p>Now that the carpeting and red brocade have been stripped away, Edwardian no longer describes the handsome corner dining room in the Plaza overlooking Grand Army Plaza. Its airy brightness suits its new personality as an American-style brasserie called ONEc.p.s., opening today. Alan Stillman, whose New York Restaurant Group runs it, named it for One Central Park South, an unlikely address for the even-numbered side of the street. David Burke is in charge of the kitchen; Adam Tihany did the design. Their touches of whimsy include a chocolate horse-and-buggy dessert and mammoth hanging red lampshades.</p>
