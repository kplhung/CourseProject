        <p>After not developing any new comedy hits last year, NBC is still struggling with the genre it rode to prominence in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Problems with ''The Michael Richards Show,'' named for a former ''Seinfeld'' star, were reported this summer, when the pilot episode for NBC was retooled.</p>
        <p>The latest bad news for the network came when Nat Bernstein and Mitchel Katlin, executive producers and creators of ''Cursed'' -- one of four half-hour sitcoms that are to make their debuts on NBC this fall -- left their posts on Friday.</p>
        <p>Executives said yesterday that they hoped to complete a deal with Adam Chase, a former co-executive producer of ''Friends,'' to take over the executive producer duties on ''Cursed.''</p>
        <p>Network executives said they expected ''Cursed'' to make its debut on Oct. 12, as expected, in the prime Thursday night time slot at 8:30.</p>
        <p>What happened?</p>
        <p>Both the network and the former producers say they could not agree on the show's direction.</p>
        <p>''Cursed'' is based on the misadventures of an advertising executive, played by Steven Weber, whose life is turned upside down after a curse is put on him during a blind date with a woman who practices black magic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bernstein said he and Mr. Katlin were getting mixed signals from network executives, who questioned the name of the show and at one point even suggested doing away with the premise of the curse altogether.</p>
        <p>''The response was, 'We love the pilot; maybe we should get rid of the curse,' '' he said. ''The fact of the matter is that from the very, very beginning, there were many opinions and many cooks, and there were many things that people would have liked to have seen. It was a very difficult process.''</p>
        <p>Network executives said that they were not happy with the scripts they were receiving from the producers but that they expected to keep the main premise.</p>
        <p>Trouble with the program was first reported in Variety and The Hollywood Reporter.</p>
