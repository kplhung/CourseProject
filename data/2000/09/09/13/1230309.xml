        <p>PITT-William H. Philanthropist and real estate magnate of Greenwich, CT., and Palm Beach, FL, died on September 9 following a brief illness. The beloved husband of Pauline Baker Pitt. He was predeceased by his first wife, Theodora Ward Pitt and his son William H. Pitt III. He was the stepfather of Sandra Pine Doubleday of Hobe Sound, FL, Hope Pine Kelly of Darien, CT, Serena Boardman of NY, and Samantha Boardman of NY. The son of the late William H. Pitt and Regina Mulgrew Pitt. William Pitt was born in Stamford, CT on October 16, 1926. He founded the William Pitt Real Estate Company in Stamford in 1949, which today is one of the largest privately held real estate companies in the country. He was largely responsible for the development of Stamford into a bustling corporate business center, bringing a number of major corporations to southwestern CT in the 1970's including GTE, Xerox, and Price Waterhouse. He established The William H. Pitt Foundation in 1985 in memory of his son to benefit deserving youth in Fairfield County, CT primarily through education. Evidence of his generosity stands throughout Fairfield County, CT: The William Pitt Health &amp; Recreation Center at Sacred Heart University, The William Pitt Family Medicine Center at Stamford, former St. Joseph Hospital, The William Pitt Child Development Center at Hillandale School and The William Pitt Youth Center at the Stamford YMCA. He was a member of the National Golf Links of America, the Racquet Club of NY, the Brook Club of NY, the Everglades Club in Palm Beach, FL, and the Bath and Tennis Club of Palm Beach, FL. A Requiem Mass will be held at St. Mary's Church, Elm Street, Stamford, CT at 11:00 AM, Wednesday, September 13. Interment will be private. In lieu of flowers, donations to The William H. Pitt Foundation, Inc., P.O. Box 120063, Stamford, CT 06912, would be appreciated.</p>
