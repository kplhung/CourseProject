        <p>With the demise of their large-scale tax cut, Republican leaders in Congress met today with President Clinton at the White House to discuss unfinished legislation and request that he set aside 90 percent of this year's surplus to pay down the national debt.</p>

        <p>With the demise of their large-scale tax cut, Republican leaders in Congress met today with President Clinton at the White House to discuss unfinished legislation and request that he set aside 90 percent of this year's surplus to pay down the national debt.</p>
        <p>''I think we're down here to find a fair middle ground and try to start to have some productivity and finish up the season,'' said Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois.</p>
        <p>But Democratic leaders who attended the meeting quickly seized on the Republican request concerning the surplus, saying they were puzzled by the last-minute proposal. For two years, Republicans have made tax cuts their showcase issue, though they have often mentioned debt reduction and protecting Social Security and Medicare in the same breath.</p>
        <p>President Clinton vetoed their two most popular tax-cutting bills in August as too expensive and too skewed toward the wealthy.</p>
        <p>''Republicans spent their entire two years trying to pass these tax cuts and now they say they really want to pay down the debt,'' said Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader. ''It's either a gimmick designed to get them out of town or a break from where they have been in the past, if you play it out over 10 years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton told Republicans he viewed paying down the debt as a priority, but said he was not sure it could be done in the 2001 fiscal budget, which is set to begin on Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>Spending requests are also piling up, Mr. Clinton said. The government must send emergency money to Western states recovering from wildfires, and lawmakers want increases for military spending and to help farmers. ''Whether we can do it this year or not depends upon what the various spending commitments are,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>As the discussion veered off to other matters, Mr. Clinton said he hoped Congress would pass bills to overhaul managed care and classify violence against gays as hate crimes, an issue the House is expected to take up on Wednesday. Mr. Clinton said he hoped to reach a compromise on raising the minimum wage and providing some tax relief to small businesses, which Republicans want to see linked in the same bill.</p>
        <p>But most of today's discussion revolved around the Republican proposal to reduce the debt.</p>
        <p>For Republicans, the shift in emphasis from tax cuts and toward reducing the debt is an effort to take the money off the table, rein in spending and protect them from Mr. Clinton's attacks on their tax cuts. It is also a move to put Mr. Clinton in an awkward position, since he and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, both support paying down the debt.</p>
        <p>''If you lock in the debt reduction, you don't spend it,'' Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, said.</p>
        <p>But Democrats said a proposal to set aside 90 percent of the surplus for only one year would do nothing to pay down the debt. As it stands, they said, that figure is not so different from what already exists in the budget requests.</p>
        <p>''The president's budget more than meets the 90 percent marker,'' said Gene Sperling, Mr. Clinton's top economic policy adviser. ''But the real test is not a potentially artificial one-year number but whether or not there is a 10-year commitment to debt reduction and paying off the debt over exploding tax cuts.''</p>
        <p>Democrats portrayed the request as an effort to jump on a more popular bandwagon and as a split from the direction Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, is headed in with his large tax-cut package.</p>
        <p>The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the surplus next year will total $268 billion. By setting aside 90 percent, nearly $30 billion would be available for extra spending and tax cuts.</p>
        <p>''We smell a rat,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader. ''If it's a one-year plan, it's a gimmick. If it's a 12-year plan, they're divorcing themselves from their presidential candidate, George Bush, because George Bush has committed all of that surplus to a tax cut.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman fpr Mr. Bush, Ari Fleischer, said that the Bush plan would eliminate the debt by 2016. The Gore plan would eliminate it by 2012.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders said their proposal was no gimmick, simply a bid to make Mr. Clinton choose between increasing spending or reducing the debt. Michele Davis, the press secretary for Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said: ''It's saying, 'O.K., Mr. President, you vetoed the marriage penalty. Fine. That money is going to debt reduction. You vetoed the death tax. That money goes to debt reduction and you don't get to spend it.' ''</p>
        <p>Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, said that the meeting was most productive; Republicans, he said, established a direct line to Mr. Clinton, without interference from Democratic leaders, to discuss issues that would come up in the waning weeks of the session. ''We were straightforward with him,'' Mr. DeLay said. ''We didn't pull any punches.''</p>
