        <p>When the Mets reached first place at the end of August, they did not get there by bludgeoning opponents. Good pitching and a few timely hits were enough. When the hits stopped coming this month, the Mets started losing. The players got worried, and the veterans sensed that this made no sense.</p>
        <p>''When we were winning games, 3-2, 3-1, we were only getting six hits, but nobody said nothing,'' John Franco said. ''When we were losing, everybody started worrying.''</p>
        <p>A lot of guys had a lot on their minds, said Franco, who discovered this after the Mets lost on Monday night. A couple of other veterans approached Franco about calling a players-only meeting, the Mets' first of the year, and Franco did so yesterday. At 6 p.m., with coaches and reporters out of the room, the players opened up to each other. Nobody knew for certain if that 20-to-30 minute talk made a difference in last night's game. Meetings are overrated, said the veteran infielder Lenny Harris, one of at least seven Mets who spoke. Todd Pratt, the veteran reserve catcher, said most meetings have about a 50 percent success rate -- no effect.</p>
        <p>But the Mets acted and played differently last night, and the immediate result was a 10-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. The Mets, who won for only the third time in 11 games this month, are two games behind the Atlanta Braves for first place in the National League East.</p>
        <p>Besides Franco and Harris, the veterans Dennis Cook, Al Leiter, Mike Piazza, Robin Ventura and Todd Zeile spoke at the meeting. The themes were common -- ''Don't worry about the headlines, relax and have fun,'' Jay Payton said. But, Leiter said, the larger theme was accountability.</p>
        <p>''When you verbalize what everyone already knows and feels,'' Leiter said, ''you put yourself on the line because you actually express what you should be doing, as opposed to listening to someone else lecture you. That's what's productive about players' meetings. It's nothing different than what Bobby tells us. But when you're saying it, you're committing yourself to being that player.''</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine said he did not know about the meeting until some players told him on the bench that it had gone well. ''I don't ask questions,'' he said. ''It's their clubhouse, and it's their domain.''</p>
        <p>It was obvious to Valentine that something was different about his team, that there was a fire in their eyes, he said.</p>
        <p>When left fielder Benny Agbayani circled the bases on a bizarre play in the second inning, the team's spirit came alive. ''Maybe it was just kindling waiting to be struck,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>The Mets scored their first run when Brewers catcher Tyler Houston threw away a sacrifice bunt by the Mets' starter, Bobby J. Jones. With two runners on and one out, Agbayani laced a single to center. Two runs scored, and the throw from Brewers center fielder Lou Collier was well up the third-base line.</p>
        <p>Agbayani had stopped for a moment at first, but he heard the coach Mookie Wilson screaming: ''Go! Go! Go!'' So he chugged for second as Houston fired to the bag. Agbayani slid as the throw sailed into center, where Collier picked it up and made his second throw home on the same play.</p>
        <p>Agbayani made it safely, beating Collier's throw and Richie Sexson's relay, and the Mets had a 4-1 lead.</p>
        <p>''We haven't had the lead in too many games,'' Payton said. ''When you can get that lead, it helps you relax.''</p>
        <p>The Mets continued to pile on runs for Jones, who improved to 9-5 by allowing two runs on seven hits and two walks in eight innings. Milwaukee starter John Snyder allowed seven runs in four and one-third innings, and six of those runs came with under two outs.</p>
        <p>During their slide, catcher Piazza felt, too many of the Mets' runs had come with two outs. ''Those should be a bonus,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Instead, the bonuses last night were the bases-empty homers in the late innings, one by Agbayani and another by Edgardo Alfonzo. That gave the Mets 10 runs for the first time since a 13-3 victory over Arizona on Aug. 25. Since then, the Mets had batted .200 and had not had a 10-hit game until last night.</p>
        <p>But offense and the pitching came together this time, and afterward the locker room erupted when the final out of the Braves' loss was shown on the clubhouse television. It was only one game, but the Mets seemed to be alive again. They were smiling, anyway.</p>
        <p>''It was good for the team to have fun for the first time in a few weeks,'' Pratt said.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>DEREK BELL had two hits last night and lined out sharply in another at-bat. The right fielder has been streaky all year, and now he is hot again. Bell, who entered this homestand on a 7-for-68 slide, is 8 for 22 in his last five games. ''The timing of his front foot is early when he's hitting well and late when he's hitting poorly,'' Manager BOBBY VALENTINE said. ''It looks like he's got better early timing now.'' . . . In coin flips by Major League Baseball yesterday, the Mets went 1-1. If they are tied with the Braves for the N.L. East title, the tie-breaking game would be played at Atlanta. But if the Mets and Arizona Diamondbacks are tied for the wild-card berth, the Mets would play host to the one-game playoff.</p>
