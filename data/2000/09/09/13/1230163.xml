        <p>A former New York City school superintendent has filed a federal lawsuit accusing former Chancellor Rudy Crew of firing him because he is white and because the chancellor needed a scapegoat to appease Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a powerful business group at a time when the school system was under fire for low test scores.</p>
        <p>Robert E. Riccobono was one of 5 superintendents dismissed by Dr. Crew during a much publicized shake-up on June 23, 1999, in which Dr. Crew also closed 13 schools and took direct control of 43 others.</p>
        <p>While not suggesting that Mr. Giuliani played any personal role in firing him, Mr. Riccobono asserts that Dr. Crew acted under pressure from the mayor and the business group, the New York City Partnership, to show that he was making progress in the school system. He contends that he was singled out because he lacked political patrons and because Dr. Crew did not want to fire only black and Hispanic superintendents. While two of the fired superintendents are white women, Mr. Riccobono says that because of their age they were able to retire instead of being dismissed outright. .</p>
        <p>Dr. Crew, now the executive director of the Institute for K-12 Leadership at the University of Washington, did not return calls for comment. Chad Vignola, counsel for the chancellor's office, said he could not comment on pending litigation, and the Partnership also did not return calls.</p>
        <p>At the time of the firings, Dr. Crew said he based his decisions on management skills, leadership and student test scores. While a 1997 state law gave the chancellor the authority to fire any of the system's 32 district superintendents for poor performance, Dr. Crew never developed formal standards for evaluating superintendents, as envisioned by the law. It was only after he left that his successor, Harold O. Levy, developed such standards.</p>
        <p>Dr. Crew, Mr. Riccobono said in his court papers, appointed a black woman, Joan Mahon-Powell, to succeed him as interim superintendent of District 19, in East New York, Brooklyn, even though Ms. Mahon-Powell had been principal of one of the lowest-performing schools in the district. East New York is an impoverished, largely black and Hispanic neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riccobono's dismissal, the court papers contend, ''was driven by the chancellor's desire to appease the mayor, the media and the New York City Partnership, and not by considerations of sound educational policy.''</p>
        <p>It was not clear from the court papers whether Mr. Riccobono had evidence to support his charges, or whether he was hoping to get it through legal discovery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riccobono has also appealed his dismissal to the State Education Commissioner, Richard P. Mills. In that case, the New York State Council of School Superintendents has filed a brief supporting Mr. Riccobono, questioning whether Dr. Crew had the right under state law to dismiss Mr. Riccobono without formal charges and a chance for a hearing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riccobono is seeking punitive and compensatory damages and unspecified compensation for back pay, loss of future earnings and for lawyer's fees. The court papers were filed Friday.</p>
        <p>In an interview yesterday, Mr. Riccobono said he believed that he was singled out because Dr. Crew was trying to balance what he perceived to be competing racial interests.</p>
        <p>''Does he hate white people?'' Mr. Riccobono said of Dr. Crew, who is black. ''No, probably not. I think it was political racism.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Riccobono was the only one of the five superintendents fired outright, and he contends that of the others, the two minority ones were given the most favorable treatment. Askia Davis, who is black, was given a job at central headquarters, while Mary Rivera, who is Hispanic, was allowed to accrue enough pension benefits to retire. The other two superintendents were both white women of retirement age, and they retired immediately.</p>
