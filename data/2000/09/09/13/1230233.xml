        <p>Pilots for Aer Lingus, the Irish airline, demanded pay increases that would make their salaries comparable with pilots in other airlines that belong to the One World Alliance, of which Aer Lingus is a member. In the case of top-earning pilots, who currently make 87,000 Irish pounds ($95,000) a year, the demands called for a near doubling, to more than 160,000 pounds. The Irish Airline Pilots' Association said that its members share work with employees of other airlines and that it had received complaints that Aer Lingus salaries were lowering the industry average.</p>
