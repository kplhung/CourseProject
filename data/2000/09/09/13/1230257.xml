        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your Sept. 12 editorial criticizing Al Gore for his proposal to stop the marketing of inappropriate entertainment material to children:</p>
        <p>The R-rated movies that are marketed to teenagers wind up being marketed to my 7-year-old. Since the trailers for new movies can be edited so that they are deemed appropriate ''for all audiences,'' they are shown before movies for young children. Also, many of the TV shows watched by teenagers between 6 and 7:30 p.m. are also seen by much younger children, and these same movies are advertised during these programs.</p>

        <p>Personally, I applaud Mr. Gore's courage in criticizing a traditional ally of his party. Children are impressionable, and even if the violence and sex that the media exposes them to don't cause criminal behavior, they contribute to a lowering of standards of civility and respect.</p>
