        <p>The Emmy Awards struck back this week against all those who have denigrated the award as all but meaningless: with 21.8 million viewers, the broadcast Sunday on ABC was the most-watched Emmy Awards show since the Nielsen company started using the people-meter ratings system in 1986.</p>
        <p>The show also added significant numbers of younger viewers, bringing in the most young adult women since 1994 and the most young adult men since 1992.</p>
        <p>Many television executives said that the big increase in ratings was proof that television was having a revival of sorts with the American public.</p>
        <p>Naturally the biggest evidence of that revival has been the enormous number of people watching first ''Who Wants to be A Millionaire'' on ABC and then ''Survivor'' on CBS.</p>
        <p>But neither show was up for any Emmy Awards, though the show did open with an elaborate comedy sketch based on ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>One difference this year was a change in the voting system, which broke away from the blue-ribbon panels that previously selected winners after watching nominees over one day in one room. This year the winners were picked by a much broader group of voters who watched tapes at home.</p>
        <p>The most noticeable result was more Emmys for the shows considered the hottest favorites of the season: five for ''The West Wing'' and three for ''Will and Grace.''</p>
