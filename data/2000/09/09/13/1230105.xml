      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A word was omitted last Wednesday from an article in this section about almond farming in California. The affected sentence should have read, ''Almonds were first brought to the state in the 18th century, by the Franciscan padres who founded the chain of coastal missions, but the trees suffered in the misty, moist conditions near the Pacific, and only a hundred years later were successfully planted inland.''</p>
