        <p>The Walt Disney Company announced yesterday that it would no longer accept advertising for R-rated movies on any programs on its ABC television network that are broadcast before 9 p.m., Eastern time.</p>

        <p>The Walt Disney Company announced yesterday that it would no longer accept advertising for R-rated movies on any programs on its ABC television network that are broadcast before 9 p.m., Eastern time.</p>
        <p>The decision came in response to a report this week from the Federal Trade Commission that criticized the entertainment industry for marketing films with violent and sexual content to children.</p>
        <p>Movie advertising is one of the most lucrative sources of revenue for television networks. According to figures from Competitive Media Reports, which tracks television advertising, movie studios spent $668 million on the four big broadcast networks last year. For the first half of 2000, the figure has grown to $418 million. For ABC, the figures were $148 million from movie advertising in 1999 and $115 million for the first half of 2000.</p>
        <p>Disney released comprehensive guidelines for the company in regard to its marketing practices, many of which were restatements of existing policies, said John Dreyer, the company's corporate spokesman.</p>
        <p>The ban on commercials for R-rated movies on the Disney-owned ABC network is an extension of an existing policy, Mr. Dreyer said, ''but previously there had been exceptions.'' He added, ''From now on there will be no exceptions.''</p>
        <p>He said he did not expect the prohibition to result in a very significant loss of revenue for the network.</p>
        <p>No other network has a prohibition tied to the first hour of prime time, an hour that was once formally designated by the networks as a ''family viewing hour.''</p>
        <p>But the Fox network has an existing policy that prohibits commercials for R-rated films in any show considered to be family programming, a Fox spokesman, Jeff DeRome, said. Among the shows included in that category are ''The Simpsons,'' ''Malcolm in the Middle'' and ''Futurama.''</p>
        <p>CBS executives declined to comment on that network's formal policies, but in recent years CBS has had virtually no programs with significant numbers of children watching. That changed somewhat this summer when ''Survivor'' became a hit with almost every age group, and not coincidentally, CBS began taking in far more money from movie studios, thanks to that program.</p>
        <p>NBC ties its own policy to the composition of its audience, saying it will not accept commercials for R-rated films in any show whose audience is made up of more that 30 percent children.</p>
        <p>Rosalyn Weinman, a senior vice president of NBC, said that no show on NBC reached that threshold last season. In recent years, NBC has taken in more movie money than any other network, largely on the strength of its lineup of Thursday programs, one of which, ''Friends,'' is on at 8 p.m.</p>
