        <p>With only three months left before the Environmental Protection Agency is to release a decision on the decades-old problem of PCB contamination in the Hudson River, a fight in Congress that some politicians and E.P.A. officials say could delay the ruling yet again -- perhaps into the next presidential administration -- is reaching a showdown.</p>
        <p>The House of Representatives passed a bill in June that would require the environmental agency to consider a study on the impact of dredging, now under way at the National Academy of Sciences, before authorizing any new dredging. The study, which is already running behind schedule, could push the E.P.A.'s ruling on the Hudson past the December deadline the agency had set, since it is considering dredging as a remedy.</p>
        <p>In addition, opponents say the House bill would make dredging and other cleanup decisions much more cumbersome and complicated to undertake. The Senate Appropriations Committee is scheduled to take up its own version of the bill, which does not require the E.P.A. to consider the dredging study, today.</p>
        <p>Resolving those differences in a House-Senate conference committee over the next month, Congressional staff members and lawmakers say, could bring many of the questions  that have long swirled around the Hudson River cleanup -- from the science of the clean-up to public opinion about it -- into sharper focus.</p>
        <p>''The Senate knows better than to delay the cleanup of the Hudson River,'' said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democrat of New Jersey and an Appropriations Committee member who fought against the dredging provision. ''The real question now is whether the House will insist.''</p>
        <p>Opponents of the provision on the dredging study, including Mr. Lautenberg, say the legislation is tactical -- an attempt by General Electric and its allies in Congress to  delay further a possible order requiring the company to spend what could amount to a billion dollars or more cleaning up the chemicals it released into the river over three decades.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the provision in the House bill say it is intended to make sure the agency bases its decisions on the most up-to-date science. They say that before the E.P.A. can make a carefully reasoned scientific decision about the Hudson, it must take into account what they say is the most thorough examination of the consequences of dredging: the National Academy study, which is specifically examining the implications of dredging pollutants from sediment.</p>
        <p>The bill requires the E.P.A. not only to consider the Academy of Sciences study, but also to incorporate the findings in its decision-making process for other cleanups.</p>
        <p>Agency officials say the bill's language on that point is so unclear and open to interpretation that the cleanups they order could be stymied by challenges in the courts. The bill, aimed not just at dredging but at all ''invasive remedial technologies'' used by the agency, could delay  cleanup actions at 28 polluted sites in 14 states, they say.</p>
        <p>Other uncertainties swirl in the background. The dredging study has been repeatedly delayed, for example, although a spokesman for the National Academy of Sciences said this week that it would probably meet its current deadline, Nov. 30, to send its findings to the E.P.A. President Clinton also indicated earlier this year that the dredging amendment language was unacceptable and could prompt a veto.</p>
        <p>And now, the end-of-session legislative process itself could become a source of further delay, as Congress and the White House struggle to finish pending business before a proposed adjournment next month.</p>
        <p>The problem the environmental agency will recommend methods for abating is a longstanding one. General Electric's factories in upstate New York released more than 500 tons of PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls -- used in the manufacture of electric capacitors -- into the upper Hudson between 1946 and 1977, under legal permits from the state. The PCB's found their way into the tissues of fish, and thus became a cancer risk to humans who eat the fish, the E.P.A. has concluded.</p>
        <p>The chemicals also settled on the river bottom, and into the layers of silt and sediment that accumulate over time. Studies commissioned by General Electric have said that stirring up that silt by dredging will re-release the PCB's, which it says are now safely entombed. The environmental agency, while not definitely saying that it would order the river to be dredged, has said that PCB levels are not dropping fast enough to conclude that natural river burial has solved the problem.</p>
