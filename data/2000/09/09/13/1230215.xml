        <p>A generation ago, six major commercial banks dominated the financial world in New York, which itself was the financial capital of the world's largest economy.</p>
        <p>Now J. P. Morgan -- the last of those six to stay independent -- is about to be bought, in the latest example of a trend toward financial concentration. If the planned takeover by Chase Manhattan is completed, it will bring together four of the six biggest banks in New York, circa 1980. And yet the combination reflects weakness as much as strength, as both institutions seek growth in areas where their previous efforts have not been especially successful.</p>
        <p>Two decades ago, the commercial banks were dominant because they were the major financial intermediaries for both individuals and companies. Investment banks and insurance companies had their own niches, some quite profitable, but none of them seemed to be in a position to challenge the big banks as financial powerhouses.</p>
        <p>What happened? Beginning in the 1970's, the commercial banks' dominance of their franchise diminished as corporations discovered they could save money by issuing securities rather than borrowing from banks. As the stock market boomed for years, investors' money flowed out of banks and into stocks and mutual funds.</p>
        <p>And the commercial banks were hobbled by a series of loan debacles that damaged some severely and hurt all to some extent, whether in real estate or loans to third world countries. It took years for the banks to recover from those problems, and by then their competitors were ahead of them in many areas.</p>
        <p>On top of that, Depression-era laws aimed at protecting banks from possible losses in securities made it difficult for them to move into other financial products. By the time those laws were largely repealed, it was the investment banks that were dominant.</p>
        <p>At the close of trading yesterday, Chase Manhattan -- a company that includes the former Chemical New York and Manufacturers Hanover Banks -- had a market capitalization of $66 billion, and J. P. Morgan had shares valued at $29 billion.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the investment banking company descended from J. P. Morgan, had a market capitalization of $121 billion. Morgan Stanley was split from Morgan after the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 required the separation of investment banks and commercial banks. For decades no one doubted that J. P. Morgan itself had made the right decision by sticking to commercial banking. Now it will be subsumed, while Morgan Stanley is a dominant company.</p>
        <p>The trend of financial consolidation, said H. Rodgin Cohen, a partner in Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and a lawyer involved in many bank mergers -- but not in the Chase-Morgan talks -- can be traced largely to three factors: ''convergence, globalization and technology.''</p>
        <p>By convergence, he refers to the fact that many financial institutions can now offer similar products, in contrast to the old days of protected turf. Globalization has put a premium on gaining strength in markets around the world, and the heavy costs of installing new technology have made it much more difficult for small players to compete.</p>
        <p>There are many areas where Chase and Morgan would seem to complement each other. ''They can fill in each other's gaps,'' said Ronald Mandle, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Chase's strongest position is in equity securities is in technology stocks, thanks to its acquisition of Hambrecht &amp; Quist. Morgan has a broader equity business, but is not strong in technology. ''Morgan is stronger in Europe and Chase is a leader in syndicating U.S. loans,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In 1980, the largest New York-based bank was Citibank. It still holds that position, but it is now part of Citigroup, which was formed by the merger of Citicorp, Citibank's parent, and Travelers, the large insurance and investment banking company run by Sanford I. Weill. While the Citi name survived, the bank is now part of a much larger company mainly run by executives who came from outside.</p>
        <p>Chase ranked second among New York banks in 1980, followed by Manufacturers Hanover, Morgan, Chemical and Bankers Trust. Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover merged in 1991, and then acquired Chase (and its name) in 1995. Bankers Trust sold to Deutsche Bank, a German institution, in a deal annnounced in 1998.</p>
        <p>The two non-New York banks in the top eight, as compiled by American Banker in 1980, have not fared much better. Bank of America, then No. 1, and Continental Illinois, then No. 7, have joined and both have been taken over by what was, in 1980, North Carolina National Bank, which ranked 26th in the nation.</p>
