        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Brent Staples (''When Dogs Are More Important Than People,'' Editorial Observer, Sept. 10) sees a dog problem in this city. He suggests that all dogs and their owners may be made to suffer for the lapses of some antisocial or aggressive dog owners by the withdrawing of ''privileges'' like ''courtesy hours,'' when dogs may run off-leash in a park.</p>
        <p>Yet any number of legal and civil regulations already cover the hardly new issue of when a person is bitten by a dog. It would make better sense to apply the law properly as it stands, rather than to punish law-abiding dog owners by withdrawing off-leash time for their animals.</p>
        <p>Automobiles, too, are intrusive, ubiquitous and sometimes even deadly. But when car accidents occur, one can be fairly sure that the authorities will use their powers under the law to deal with the matter expeditiously. A threat to cut the ''privileges'' of all car owners, because of the awful behavior of some of them, would rightly be regarded as an outrageous idea.</p>
