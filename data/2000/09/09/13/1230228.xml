        <p>She was a school librarian with a knack for nurturing students who were learning English at the Chinatown elementary school where she had worked since 1967. She lived in the same apartment for more than 30 years, although her colleagues remembered that she often spoke of problems with her landlord.</p>
        <p>He was described by some of his tenants as an eccentric man who could sometimes be drawn into a conversation about Manhattan architecture or German cuisine. One of his sisters, who also lived in the building, said the librarian drove her brother crazy with endless complaints.</p>
        <p>The librarian, Barbara B. Kenna, 69, and the landlord, Louis Hubrecht, 65, had apparently been feuding for decades, and prosecutors are now investigating how and why the fighting boiled over into fatal gunshots early Monday morning.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Hubrecht's arraignment yesterday, Robert Frazer, an assistant district attorney, gave a different version of events than the one given after the shooting on Monday, and said he was citing the landlord's videotaped statement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frazer said that Mr. Hubrecht shot Ms. Kenna about 8:15 a.m. as she dragged a metal luggage cart down the stairs of the building where they lived, at 700 Madison Avenue between 62nd and 63rd Streets in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The cart that Ms. Kenna was pulling down the stairs from her penthouse apartment banged against the door of Mr. Hubrecht's third-floor apartment, Mr. Frazer said.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Hubrecht glimpsed through his peep-hole and saw Ms. Kenna, he reached for his .38-caliber revolver with his right hand and opened the door with his left. He fired four to six shots, Mr. Frazer said, after Ms. Kenna, holding a hammer, said, ''I'm going to kill you.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Frazer said that Ms. Kenna and Mr. Hubrecht were standing four feet apart, separated by a luggage cart. ''He made no effort to close the door,'' Mr. Frazer said. ''He made no effort to warn Ms. Kenna.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Frazer depicted Ms. Kenna as a woman who devoted decades of her life to the public school system and who was afraid that she would be evicted.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the office of the city medical examiner, Ellen Borakove, said Ms. Kenna died from multiple gunshot wounds that perforated all of her major organs.</p>
        <p>After the shooting, the authorities said, Mr. Hubrecht telephoned a sister, who persuaded him to notify the police. He did so at 9:20 a.m. In the meantime, the landlord told the authorities, he moved Ms. Kenna's body so that he could walk upstairs, collect trash from apartments and carry it outside.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hubrecht was charged with second-degree murder. Judge Patricia M. Nunez of Criminal Court ordered Mr. Hubrecht into custody yesterday afternoon, and a grand jury will begin to hear the case this week, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hubrecht's sister Alice Walker said yesterday that the shooting was ''very tragic,'' but blamed Ms. Kenna for provoking her brother with relentless complaints.</p>
        <p>''She brought this all on,'' said Ms. Walker, who was reached by telephone at her apartment in the Madison Avenue building, where she and her siblings were raised. ''She was torturing him for 34 years.'' She added that Ms. Kenna had tortured Mr. Hubrecht ''with reams of papers.''</p>
        <p>At the arraignment, Mr. Hubrecht's court-appointed lawyer, David Kapner, described Ms. Kenna's ''long history of threatening and bizarre behavior.'' On the back of her rent checks, Mr. Kapner said, Ms. Kenna would list complaints about her landlord, including items she believed that he had stolen from her apartment.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, her complaints escalated to the ''level of paranoia,'' he said. Earlier this year, Mr. Kapner said, Ms. Kenna arbitrarily changed the apartment number listed on her mailbox, confusing postal workers and neighbors.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Hubrecht's mother was alive, his lawyer charged, Ms. Kenna had threatened her with a hammer.</p>
        <p>After the shooting, a hammer lay next to the victim's feet, the police said. Emergency medical service workers at the scene said the hammer was in the victim's left hand. And Mr. Hubrecht told officials that that Ms. Kenna had been clutching the hammer with her right hand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frazer said prosecutors were investigating whether Mr. Hubrecht tampered with evidence.</p>
        <p>Yvette Rosado, who volunteers at the library at Public School 2, where Ms. Kenna worked, said that she was ''always stressed out'' about her landlord. ''She was always carrying around paperwork about how her landlord was harassing her,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Lily Liu, who runs the day care center at P.S. 2, said Ms. Kenna would sometimes speak of her landlord woes over lunch. ''She complained the landlord wanted her out,'' Ms. Liu said on Monday. ''She'd say he never left her alone.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kenna would allow students whose parents worked late to stay in the library after school was dismissed, and years ago, after Ms. Liu arrived from China, Ms. Kenna helped her perfect her English.</p>
        <p>Louise Duncan, a resident of 700 Madison Avenue, said that since she had moved into the building 15 years ago, Ms. Kenna and Mr. Hubrecht had bickered constantly. Ms. Kenna, she said, was convinced that Mr. Hubrecht wanted her out of her apartment, which a state official said was rent-controlled.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kenna was obsessed with the notion that the landlord would break into the apartment to swipe her possessions or instigate trouble, Ms. Duncan said.</p>
        <p>About a week ago, Ms. Kenna knocked on Ms. Duncan's door to ask whether water was seeping through her ceiling. She suspected that Mr. Hubrecht had entered her apartment and turned on the faucets, Ms. Duncan said, and would regularly use the luggage cart that sparked Monday's shooting to tote her valuables from place to place because she was afraid to leave them at home.</p>
        <p>While several of Mr. Hubrecht's tenants described him as reclusive and offbeat, the murder shocked his neighbors and tenants on Madison Avenue, where Mr. Hubrecht owns two brownstones.</p>
        <p>Suzanne Newman, who owns a store on the first floor of 700 Madison Avenue, said Mr. Hubrecht would swap recommendations on German restaurants with an employee. ''He was never on top of you for late payments,'' she said. ''He was very understanding.''</p>
        <p>Brian Hall, who owns a men's clothing store at 698 Madison Avenue said Mr. Hubrecht would come alive when speaking about the buildings that had gone up in the neighborhood.  ''I always got the feeling he didn't want any confrontation,'' Mr. Hall said.</p>
