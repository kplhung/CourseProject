        <p>After 22 years as a producer for HBO Sports, Ross Greenburg was named the president yesterday, succeeding Seth Abraham, who is leaving to become chief operating officer of Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>''The only change in my day-to-day world will be diving in to the boxing pool,'' said Greenburg, who has been the senior vice president and executive producer since 1995.</p>
        <p>One of Greenburg's primary tasks is to re-sign Roy Jones Jr. to a multiyear contract, a goal that has so far eluded HBO.</p>
