        <p>It took only a few minutes for Chris Witty to discover she was a prodigy in speed skating. As a 10-year-old in West Allis, Wis., she entered a 500-meter race wearing her brother's figure skates. Still, she won so easily that she was showing the gold medal to her mother by the time the second-place skater reached the finish line.</p>
        <p>Having won silver and bronze medals at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, Witty will again be a favorite in the middle distances at the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. First, however, she will enter the 500-meter cycling time trial on Saturday at the Sydney Games, attempting to become only the fourth person to win medals in both the Winter and Summer Olympics.</p>
        <p>''It would be awesome, probably more than I hoped for,'' Witty, who is 25, said in an interview last week.</p>
        <p>Only one athlete has ever won a gold medal in both Olympics. Eddie Eagan of Denver took the light-heavyweight boxing title at the 1920 Summer Games in Antwerp, Belgium; 12 years later, he finished first as part of the four-man bobsled at the 1932 Winter Games in Lake Placid, N.Y. Jacob Tullin Thams of Norway won the ski jump at the 1924 Winter Games in Chamonix, France, and finished second in the 8-meter sailing competition at the 1936 Summer Games in Berlin.</p>
        <p>The athletic ancestor to Witty was Christa Luding-Rothenburger of the former East Germany, who won gold medals in speed skating at the 1984 Sarajevo Games and the 1988 Calgary Olympics, then took a silver in the cycling 1,000-meter match sprint at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea. All of her medals have since been devalued, given revelations about the state-sponsored system of doping in the former East Germany.</p>
        <p>''You can't compare people with East Germans and the system they came up through,'' said Des Dickie, the American sprint track coach for cycling.</p>
        <p>Even so, speed skaters have long used cycling for cross-training. The Olympic 500-meter cycling time trial will consist of two laps around the velodrome. It is not dissimilar to a 500-meter speed skating race. The times are similar, both involve anaerobic sprints and the athletes are powered by the same primary muscle groups, quads and glutes. The transfer is one way, however. Because of the precise technique required, few cyclists take up speed skating.</p>
        <p>''Skating technique is not something you can learn in a couple of years,'' Witty said. ''You have to learn when you're young. Cycling is more brute strength. If you are fit, you can get on a bike and smooth out your pedal stroke, and it's possible to get to the top level.''</p>
        <p>Felicia Ballanger of France, the world record-holder at 34.0 seconds in the 500-meter time trial, will be favored in Sydney. Witty's personal best is 35.5. A second and a half is like an hour when it comes to races decided by hundredths of a second. If Witty trained full time for cycling, she would be a consistent medal contender in international events, Dickie said. She finished fourth at the 1998 world championships. He ranks her among the top six in Sydney and hopes for the magic of unexpected triumph that makes the Olympics so riveting.</p>
        <p>''Look at Olympic skating,'' Witty said. ''You have medal favorites, and things don't go right, whether they're tense or something, and someone normally 7 through 10 ends up winning the race or a medal. In the Olympics, you never know.''</p>
        <p>She speaks from disappointed experience. She had been favored to win the 1,000 meters in speed skating at the Nagano Games, only to grow nervous from expectation. Anxious, excited, Witty set an early pace that was too fast, and even though she won the silver medal, she felt as if she had squandered her chance.</p>
        <p>In cycling, the pressure of expectation is not so bulging as the pressure in the tires. Perhaps Witty will feel as relaxed in Sydney as she did at the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, when, as a carefree 18-year-old, she skated a personal best in finishing 23rd in the 1,000-meter race.</p>
        <p>''In '98, I felt like the whole world was on my shoulders,'' Witty said. ''Here, it's kind of a mixture. I'm curious to see how it will go. Will I start to feel tense? Or will I go back to '94, beginner-type focus, relaxed?''</p>
        <p>As a girl, she skated on baseball diamonds in West Allis that were flooded and frozen, paying a quarter or a half dollar for an afternoon on the ice. Her promising career seemed as if it might end when the factory that made agricultural machinery closed and her father was left without a job. ''We'll find a way,'' her mother told Chris and her three older brothers. She and her brother Mike got paper routes. At skating competitions, they overstuffed hotel rooms to save money.</p>
        <p>At 15 or 16, Witty began cross-training on her bike. She won a bronze medal at the 1992 world junior championships and followed with national championships in the 500-meter time trial in 1996 and '98. The time trial was not an Olympic event in 1996, so Witty bought her own tickets to the Atlanta Games, watching cycling, diving, soccer and volleyball. This year, she will be sitting on her bike in the Sydney velodrome instead of sitting in the audience.</p>
        <p>Witty spent the summer training twice a day for her two sports, riding her bike and her in-line skates. The biggest difference between the two? Sunburn, she said. That shouldn't be much of a problem in the chilly weather of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
        <p>''That's why I chose this Olympics; it's winter,'' she said with a laugh.</p>
