        <p>If there is anyone out there who has had any success playing special teams -- returning punts or defending punt returns -- Jets Coach Al Groh would probably take a glance at your job application this week.</p>
        <p>The Jets' revolving door of punt returners and their experiment at coverage groups during the first two games of the season has turned up nothing but disaster.</p>
        <p>In the first half of Monday night's game, the Patriots began drives after punts on the Jets' 44-yard line and the 34-yard line. Each led to a field goal.</p>
        <p>In two games, Jets opponents are averaging an astonishing 27.2 yards a punt return, and the Jets rank next to last in the league in opponents' punt return average.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Jets -- who used Dedric Ward and the newly acquired Damon Dunn on punt returns Monday night, both of whom fumbled -- have a dismal 1.7 yard return average, ranking the Jets 29th in punt return average in the league. One of the teams behind the Jets on punt return average? Next Sunday's opponent, the Buffalo Bills.</p>
        <p>Groh was so disappointed in the performance of Dunn, who joined the team last week, that he said as of right now the Jets would open the Bills game with Ward returning punts. It was Ward who nearly sealed the Jets' defeat when he fumbled the last punt of the game at the Jets' 24-yard line. The rookie Tony Scott saved the victory when he recovered the fumble.</p>
        <p>''I'm just trying to find some playmakers,'' Groh said.</p>
        <p>The poor results were especially disappointing because the Jets used a lot of their front-line players -- like Mo Lewis and Marcus Coleman -- on special teams units.</p>
        <p>When asked how exasperating the special teams were, Groh said: ''Exasperating. I felt going into the game that field position, not the familiarity of the coaching staffs, was going to be the most significant issue. For a long time it was the overriding issue. We had a lot to overcome as far as that's concerned.''</p>
        <p>The kickoff return average is not much better. The Jets rank 29th in the league, averaging only 18.2 yards a return.</p>
        <p>Low Profile for Parcells</p>
        <p>Once again, Bill Parcells, the Jets' director of football operations, made himself scarce Monday night, skipping the Patriots game as he had the season opener against the Green Bay Packers.</p>
        <p>Parcells clearly wants to avoid the impression that he is peering over Groh's shoulder, and his presence at Giants Stadium -- with his two former assistants battling each other -- would have created a circus.</p>
        <p>Parcells did talk to Groh this morning.</p>
        <p>''Congratulations,'' Parcells said. ''Had them all the way, didn't you?''</p>
        <p>''That's the way we planned it,'' Groh said.</p>
        <p>Groh said he understands Parcells's motives for staying away.</p>
        <p>''Bill's support couldn't be stronger, nor his desire to help greater, if he was standing on the sideline,'' Groh said.</p>
        <p>A Scheming Chrebet</p>
        <p>Receiver Wayne Chrebet wore a wrap on his left leg when he went out for pregame warm-ups Monday. Chrebet strained a calf muscle in his right leg Saturday.</p>
        <p>So why was his left leg wrapped? It was a ruse by Chrebet to throw the Patriots off.</p>
        <p>Ellis Gets Credit</p>
        <p>Upon further review, the rookie defensive end Shaun Ellis was credited with two sacks Monday. The sacks came at critical moments.</p>
        <p>One was on third down with 4 yards to go, which forced the Patriots to punt, giving the Jets the ball for the two-play drive that led to the winning touchdown. The other sack came on the Patriots' final drive of the game, on second-and-10.</p>
        <p>Ellis struggled during training camp, adapting to the 3-4, two-gap defense, after having played the 4-3 in college. But he now has three sacks and seven tackles, plus a forced fumble and a fumble recovery this season.</p>
        <p>''He was doing what rookies do coming into a new system,'' Groh said. ''It clears up for him a little bit all the time. Last night, it was continuing to do so.''</p>
