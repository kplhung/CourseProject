        <p>The Islanders begin their preseason against Philadelphia tomorrow night and Friday night, and Coach Butch Goring has not let the venues influence his decision on which goalie will start.</p>
        <p>The veteran John Vanbiesbrouck faces his former teammates tomorrow at the Sovereign Bank Arena in Trenton. The Islanders' No.1 draft pick Rick DiPietro will be in goal at the First Union Center in Philadelphia the following night.</p>
        <p>But wouldn't there be less pressure on DiPietro, who turns 19 next week, if it were the other way around, Goring was asked yesterday at the team's camp in Lake Placid, N.Y.?</p>
        <p>The coach laughed. ''He's the kind of cocky individual who wants to take on the best,'' Goring said of DiPietro, who in June became the first goalie ever made the No. 1 overall pick in the entry draft.</p>
        <p>A day later, the Islanders signed the 37-year-old Vanbiesbrouck to buy time for their goalie of the future.</p>
        <p>Goring said the focus of the first two exhibition games would be to evaluate the young talent, DiPietro included.</p>
        <p>''We want to see how he handles it,'' Goring said. ''Whether he lets in one goal or six, it's still the start of his career.''</p>
