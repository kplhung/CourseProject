        <p>IT seems no one expects butter at the table in an Italian restaurant these days. Balsamic vinegar or olive oil is the typical spread for bread, and the best it gets is with a basil infusion.</p>
        <p>But at Pepolino, a Tuscan restaurant in TriBeCa, what accompanies the basket of crusty bread is something else entirely: a little plate holding a fragrant red mound topped with a drop of olive oil and a fresh basil leaf. It's deep salmon in color, with the texture and richness of pudding and a taste that is the total essence of tomato.</p>

        <p>IT seems no one expects butter at the table in an Italian restaurant these days. Balsamic vinegar or olive oil is the typical spread for bread, and the best it gets is with a basil infusion.</p>
        <p>But at Pepolino, a Tuscan restaurant in TriBeCa, what accompanies the basket of crusty bread is something else entirely: a little plate holding a fragrant red mound topped with a drop of olive oil and a fresh basil leaf. It's deep salmon in color, with the texture and richness of pudding and a taste that is the total essence of tomato.</p>
        <p>It's hard to stop dipping your bread into the delicate blend; you want to eat it with a fork. No wonder the owners call it a flan.</p>
        <p>But the big secret is that this is no fleeting pleasure, dependent on tomato season. Although peeled and seeded plum tomatoes can be used, the restaurant makes it with tomato sauce. Canned tomato sauce.</p>
        <p>The flan has been a signature at Pepolino since Patrizio Siddu, the chef, and Enzo Pezone, the pastry chef, opened in August 1999. ''I don't like olive oil; I don't like balsamic vinegar,'' Mr. Pezone said. ''We started putting things together, and we came up with this.''</p>
        <p>Despite its intensity, it is made with simple ingredients: that sauce, basil, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, salt, pepper and the thing that gives it standing power, gelatin.</p>
        <p>And while the flan can be made in ramekins, Mr. Pezone has a trick he uses at home. ''Why not a cappuccino cup or espresso cup?'' he said.</p>
        <p>TOMATO FLAN  Adapted from Pepolino  Time: 25 minutes</p>
        <p>1 8-ounce can Del Monte or other tomato sauce  12 large basil leaves  2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</p>
        <p>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for garnish  4 teaspoons unflavored gelatin (about 1 1/3 envelopes)  Salt and fresh black pepper to taste  Vegetable oil  12 slices country bread.</p>
        <p>1. In a blender or food processor, combine tomato sauce, 6 leaves basil, garlic,  1/4 cup olive oil, gelatin and salt and pepper to taste. Blend at high speed for 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Lightly oil 6 small cappuccino or other cups. Divide tomato mixture among cups. Refrigerate 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. To serve, dip bottom of each cup in hot water to loosen flan. Unmold onto 6 plates. Garnish with a basil leaf and a drop of olive oil. Place 2 slices bread on each plate.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
