        <p>Most New York legislators easily fend off challengers in Democratic primary; exceptions in Assembly primaries include Adam Clayton Powell 4th, who defeats Assemblyman Nelson Antonio Denis, Assemblyman Edward Griffith, who is locked in close race against Diane Gordon, and Assemblyman Arthur O Eve, who apparently ekes out victory over Crystal D Peoples; in Senate primaries, Pedro Espada Jr defeats incumbent, David Rosado, and Sen Alfred T Coppola loses to Byron W Brown; Assemblyman Samuel D Bea Jr, in surprise, loses primary for Senate seat given up by Larry Seabrook to Ruth H Thompson; Assembly members Clarence Norman Jr, Roger L Green, Darryl C Towns, Catherine Noland and Pauline Rhodd-Cummings and Sen Olga A Mendez survive Democratic primary challenges; Michael N Gianaris defeats Kimon C Thermos for nomination to open Assembly seat from Queens; John W LaVelle defeats Raymond G Jorgensen for seat being vacated by Assemblywoman Elizabeth A Connelly on Staten Island; Liz Krueger wins Manhattan Senate primary, defeating Robert J Bellinson; will face Sen Roy M Goodman, Republican; Lorraine Coyle Koppell defeats Michael R Benedetto for nomination in Bronx to face Republican Sen Guy J Velella; Robert J DiCarlo narrowly defeats Charles Capetanakis in Brooklyn Republican priarmy for nomination to face Sen Vincent Gentile, Democrat (M)</p>

        <p>Several New York lawmakers fended off challenges in the Democratic primary yesterday, once again demonstrating that when it comes to elections, the State Legislature is usually an incumbents' paradise. But there were a few exceptions, notably an East Harlem assemblyman who was defeated by former Councilman Adam Clayton Powell 4th, a son of one of the most famous politicians in city history.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powell, returning to politics after an unsuccessful run for borough president in 1997, ousted two-term Assemblyman Nelson Antonio Denis. Mr. Powell had charged during the campaign that Mr. Denis had neglected the district, while Mr. Denis had retorted that Mr. Powell's candidacy was based solely on his name.

        <p>Several New York lawmakers fended off challenges in the Democratic primary yesterday, once again demonstrating that when it comes to elections, the State Legislature is usually an incumbents' paradise. But there were a few exceptions, notably an East Harlem assemblyman who was defeated by former Councilman Adam Clayton Powell 4th, a son of one of the most famous politicians in city history.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powell, returning to politics after an unsuccessful run for borough president in 1997, ousted two-term Assemblyman Nelson Antonio Denis. Mr. Powell had charged during the campaign that Mr. Denis had neglected the district, while Mr. Denis had retorted that Mr. Powell's candidacy was based solely on his name. Mr. Powell's father, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., was an influential  Harlem congressman and civil rights leader.</p>
        <p>''People in this community are very smart, and they realized that we had virtually no representation in the State Assembly,'' Mr. Powell, who has worked in recent years as a federal emergency management official, said last night. He said Mr. Denis ''is a very intelligent guy, but I just think that his heart was not in this community.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Denis had backed an attempt this year to overthrow the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver of Manhattan, and Mr. Silver exacted revenge in the primary, refusing to give Mr. Denis the financial or organizational support that incumbents typically receive from the speaker.</p>
        <p>In Brooklyn, Assemblyman Edward Griffith was locked in a close race against Diane Gordon. In Buffalo, the longest-serving Assembly member, Arthur O. Eve, appeared to have eked out a victory against Crystal D. Peoples, majority leader of the Erie County Legislature.</p>
        <p>In the State Senate, in a continuing feud between Bronx party leaders and the Espada family, former State Senator Pedro Espada Jr. defeated the incumbent, David Rosado. Mr. Espada is facing trial on Medicaid fraud charges. And in Buffalo, State Senator Alfred T. Coppola lost to Byron W. Brown.</p>
        <p>In a surprise, a Bronx assemblyman, Samuel D. Bea Jr., lost the primary for the State Senate seat given up by Larry Seabrook. Mr. Bea was defeated by Ruth H. Thompson.</p>
        <p>Most other Democratic incumbents facing challenges survived easily. Among the Assembly members who won -- tantamount to retaining the seat in many overwhelmingly Democratic districts -- were Clarence Norman Jr., Roger L. Green and Darryl C. Towns of Brooklyn; and Catherine Nolan and Pauline Rhodd-Cummings of Queens. In the Senate, Olga A. Mendez of Manhattan also won.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, and former Mayor Edward I. Koch, a Democrat, had sought to rally support against some Democratic incumbents in the city, particularly Ms. Nolan, because they voted to repeal the income tax on commuters last year, but those efforts appeared to have had little impact.</p>
        <p>''There were a lot of charges hurled my way,'' Ms. Nolan said, ''but in the end, my neighbors felt that I was the person who served them and worked hard.'' She handily turned aside a challenge from Patrick T. O'Malley, a former Queens prosecutor whose brother Martin is the mayor of Baltimore.</p>
        <p>As usual, many incumbents did not face primary challenges. Incumbents in Albany have long maintained an iron grip on their seats, in large part because they have name recognition, the support of party committees, the authority to dole out projects and the ability to raise political money from contributors with an interest in legislation. Most turnover stems from open seats.</p>
        <p>In one such open Assembly district in Astoria, Queens, Michael N. Gianaris, a counsel for the Democratic majority in the Assembly, edged out Kimon C. Thermos, a lawyer who had sought the seat previously.</p>
        <p>On Staten Island, John W. LaVelle, the Democratic county chairman, who had pledged not to seek elected office and then changed his mind, edged out Raymond G. Jorgensen for the seat held by Assemblywoman Elizabeth A. Connelly, a Democrat who is retiring.</p>
        <p>Liz Krueger won a Democratic Senate primary on the Upper East Side, seeking to run against the longtime Republican incumbent, Roy M. Goodman. Ms. Krueger, on leave from the Community Food Resource Center, defeated Robert J. Bellinson, a lawyer, who has run against Mr. Goodman in the last two elections.</p>
        <p>In another contest to take on a longtime Republican senator, Lorraine Coyle Koppell, a lawyer who is the wife of a former state attorney general, beat Michael R. Benedetto, an elementary school teacher who is a Bronx Democratic district leader. She will face Guy J. Velella.</p>
        <p>And in a Brooklyn Republican primary, former State Senator Robert J. DiCarlo narrowly defeated Charles Capetanakis for the right to take on the incumbent Democrat, Vincent Gentile.</p>
