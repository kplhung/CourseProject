        <p>Three more people, two of them still hospitalized, have been sickened by the West Nile virus, bringing the total number of people infected in the city this year to 11, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Despite the new cases, Mr. Giuliani insisted that the city's measures against the virus, including spraying pesticide, had been successful. ''All of these situations are situations where the disease was contracted before the spraying began in that section of the city,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said the city would continue to spray until cold weather puts an end to mosquito season.</p>
        <p>Only one of the three new cases occurred on Staten Island, where seven earlier cases were confirmed this year. In the new case there, a 40-year-old woman from Castleton Corners was sickened, the mayor said. The woman has been released from the hospital.</p>
        <p>In the second new case, a 77-year-old man from Florida who was visiting his children in Canarsie, Brooklyn, is hospitalized in stable condition.</p>
        <p>In the third case, a 54-year-old man who the mayor said spent time in both Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and Cliffside Park, N.J., developed a fever and experienced ''altered mental states.'' Mr. Giuliani said the man, who is hospitalized in stable condition, spent most of the hours from dusk to dawn hours, when mosquitoes are active, in Cliffside Park.</p>
        <p>In a related development, the National Park Service has approved the first aerial spraying of the pesticide Anvil on parts of the Fire Island National Seashore, after mosquitoes infected with the West Nile Virus were found in in Saltaire.</p>
        <p>The spraying on Fire Island has not yet been scheduled because of adverse weather conditions, said Dominick Ninivaggi, superintendent for the division of vector control at the Suffolk County Department of Public Works.</p>
        <p>The pesticide cannot be sprayed unless winds around sunset are less than 10 miles per hour and the temperature is above 60 degrees, he said. It is standard procedure not to spray within 300 feet of open water, he added. National park policy normally does not allow for mosquito control at all, but an exception is being made because of public health concerns, Mr. Ninivaggi said.</p>
        <p>''At the same time we're concerned about virus activity, we're also recognizing that the weather is cooling, and mosquito activity is dying down, so we have to make a judgment as to at what point is it worthwhile to spray, and at what point is it not going to make a difference,'' he said. ''It will be a difficult judgment to make, with the weather the way it is.''</p>
        <p>In a news release, Constantine Dillon, superintendent of the Fire Island National Seashore, said the spraying would take place on federal land within his jurisdiction, from the eastern boundary of Robert Moses State Park to the western boundary of Sailors Haven and Sunken Forest. He noted that pesticides like Anvil are toxic to fish, and that the Environmental Protection Agency prohibits their use on open water.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dillon and other National Park officials did not return several calls yesterday.</p>
        <p>Local environmental groups criticized the plan, saying it was inappropriate for Fire Island. They advocated less drastic measures like preventing mosquitoes through modifying and preserving wetlands and removing breeding areas near homes.</p>
        <p>Adrienne Esposito, associate executive director of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, based in Farmingdale, said it was impossible to control the drift of pesticides sprayed into the air, so Anvil will end up in both the South Shore estuary and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
        <p>''The Sunken Forest area is only 825 feet wide,'' she said. ''It's impossible to spray areas as narrow as the Sunken Forest without contaminating coastal water resources.''</p>
