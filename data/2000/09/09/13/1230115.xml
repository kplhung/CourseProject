        <p>LOST  By Lucy Wadham  315 pages. Carroll &amp; Graf. $24.95.</p>
        <p>Corsica is the setting for ''Lost,'' a taut and atmospheric first novel by Lucy Wadham in which the kidnapping of a child gives a strange and transient meaning to the lives of several island inhabitants. No kidnapping ever took place on Corsica, the talented Ms. Wadham assures us in an author's note. This book is refreshingly not ''based on a true story.''

        <p>LOST  By Lucy Wadham  315 pages. Carroll &amp; Graf. $24.95.</p>
        <p>Corsica is the setting for ''Lost,'' a taut and atmospheric first novel by Lucy Wadham in which the kidnapping of a child gives a strange and transient meaning to the lives of several island inhabitants. No kidnapping ever took place on Corsica, the talented Ms. Wadham assures us in an author's note. This book is refreshingly not ''based on a true story.'' And maybe for that very reason Ms. Wadham seems to have made her imaginary Corsica believable.</p>
        <p>It is an austerely beautiful, politically afflicted place, where officials live in a state of exile from the French center and where a kind of human driftwood, gangsters and nongangsters alike, has collected to live out lives of isolated desperation.</p>
        <p>In any event, it won't take long for devotees of exotic adventure to fall under Ms. Wadham's spell. Described succinctly on the dust jacket as a freelance journalist who lives in Paris, Ms. Wadham writes with stylish precision. She makes you think of Graham Greene in one of his lighter moods as she teases out the emotional responses to a situation of extreme distress, managing grimness, terror and suspense like an artist mixing paint, getting the right tint, the proper degree of shadow.</p>
        <p>Why ''Lost''? Almost everybody seems to have some quality to justify Ms. Wadham's evocatively monosyllabic title. The central character is Alice Aron, a rich young widow, beautiful of course, whom we first see arriving at the airport with her two young sons to visit her dead husband's ancestral home. Watching her, waiting for her, is a small-time hoodlum named Mickey da Cruz, whose presence, along with a pair of brothers named Scatti waiting in a car, gives Ms. Wadham's story an ominous tone from the beginning.</p>
        <p>One of Alice's sons, 7-year-old Samuel, the kind of normally inquisitive boy who asks his mother which runs faster, a scorpion or a snake, is going to be taken away from her. But not before Ms. Wadham has introduced us to the other dramatis personae.</p>
        <p>First there is Antoine Stuart, the disillusioned and unhappy police commissioner whose career is in such a sad state that he spends whole days at the beach. He has a lurking intelligence, a moral incorruptibility that makes him almost outlandish in a place like Ms. Wadham's Corsica. He drives an old brown Datsun because ''the car cult on the island had always sickened him and so he kept his own in protest.'' He is not a widower but a man abandoned by the wife he still longs for, and he knows he has faded into insignificance on Corsica because the unofficial chief of the island, the leader of the criminal underworld, doesn't even bother to keep watch on him any more.</p>
        <p>The capo is Coco Santini, who lives with his mistress in a large villa designed by a Scandinavian architect. He mistreats his wife and has people he doesn't like killed, including Stuart's most valuable informant. Santini confidently maneuvers though the island's Byzantine politics to control the National Liberation Front, which started out as an independence movement but has become an entrepreneurial mafia. When young Sam is hustled into a car one morning by Mickey da Cruz and the Scatti brothers, we are not sure whether Santini is ultimately behind the kidnapping or not. But we do know that he is dangerous to deal with.</p>
        <p>''What makes people sick about you is that you pretend to be a good man when what you are is a coward,'' Santini tells Stuart as Ms. Wadham's climactic scenes approach and the characters of the two rivals have been stripped bare. ''There aren't any good men on this island. They don't survive.''</p>
        <p>Stuart replies, ''They don't survive because you kill them.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wadham constructs a complicated intrigue after the kidnapping of Sam, one with lots of the unpredictable motion that occurs when human volition comes into play. The original kidnappers are replaced by a second, radical political gang that Santini is using to keep the liberation front under his control. Sam, whom we glimpse from time to time in various states of captivity, is slowly reduced to a mute, curled up ball divorced from the sensory reality outside himself. But at the moral heart of the story is the rivalry between the good but, in Alice's eyes, ineffectual Stuart and the evil but charismatic Santini.</p>
        <p>The rivalry includes the seduction of Alice, which adds another savory element of suspense to Ms. Wadham's story. Which of the two will she trust to regain her son? The reader knows whom she should choose, but one of Ms. Wadham's skills is to imagine realistically the densely clouded mind of a young mother in which the senses of loss, guilt and desperation are mixed. Danger hovers over Ms. Wadham's story like a mist, and the danger comes not only from the evil figures in her book but from normal human frailty as well.</p>
        <p>''Lost'' in this sense remains true to Ms. Wadham's grasp of gritty, confusing reality right to the end as the chess-like conflict between Stuart and Santini reaches its conclusion. At one point, Stuart ruminates on the vanity to which police investigators are prone, that they will be able to sift the evidence, figure out the game and win it with guile and intelligence. ''But his job was to sit still as a lizard in the sun and wait for the fallible mechanism to spring and perhaps make a catch, perhaps not.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wadham's appreciation of the fallible mechanism gives this darkly entertaining novel its special aura of suspense and of something more satisfying than suspense: the melancholy feeling that people being what they are, these events -- based on nothing but imagination -- could happen exactly the way she describes them.</p>
