        <p>In the wake of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal and diminished credibility over its resolve to reduce the use of performance-enhancing drugs, the International Olympic Committee has faced a barrage of new embarrassments this week that raises questions about its ability to change significantly.</p>
        <p>The I.O.C., which has been struggling to turn attention to the Summer Games that officially open on Friday, is trying to persuade the world that it is no longer the aloof, autocratic organization that it has been during the two decades Juan Antonio Samaranch has served as president.</p>
        <p>But the Indonesian government criticized Samaranch today for lobbying for the release from jail of an I.O.C. member named Mohamad Hasan so he could attend the Games.</p>
        <p>This followed the Australian government's refusal, on grounds of national security, to allow entry in recent days to two Olympic officials: Gafur Rakhimov of Uzbekistan, who is a member of the International Amateur Boxing Federation, and Carl Ching of China, the president of the Asian Basketball Confederation. Each man has been accused of links to organized crime in published reports, and each has denied the allegation.</p>
        <p>Australia's immigration department also said it was monitoring the activities of between 20 and 40 Olympic officials for security reasons during the Games, which run from Friday through Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>Adding to the I.O.C.'s problems, many academics, scientists, athletes and coaches have criticized as insufficient and ineffective a new test for the endurance drug known as EPO, which is believed to be widely used in sports like swimming, distance running and rowing.</p>
        <p>These matters, large and small, have been reported incessantly and urgently by the fiercely competitive Australian news media, sometimes in a mocking tone, each story magnified because the Summer Games are considered the most important sports event in the country's history.</p>
        <p>Privately, some I.O.C. members said the skeptical coverage indicated that an overhaul of Olympic rules and procedures enacted after the Salt Lake City scandal might not earn broad public trust until Samaranch steps down as president next year.</p>
        <p>''I think it's probably hard for genuine reform to take place within the existing structure and with the existing president,'' said Richard Cashman, director of the Center for Olympic Studies at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.</p>
        <p>The emphasis in the Australian news media on unsavory characters, drugs, transportation problems, windy weather and shivering nights in the athletes' village has clearly exasperated some I.O.C. members, who would prefer that the focus be on wondrous performances, new stadiums and public enthusiasm in a sports-mad country.</p>
        <p>''Haven't we done anything right?'' said Phil Coles, an Australian I.O.C. member.</p>
        <p>On Monday, some I.O.C. officials even considered suing the Salt Lake City committee organizing the 2002 Winter Games over a disputed document that contains the word geld -- German for money -- next to the names of some current members. The members thought their reputations had been besmirched by the suggestion they were bribed for their votes.</p>
        <p>''Perhaps we should see if we can do something legally to attack those who continue to call our dignity into question,'' said Francois Carrard, the I.O.C.'s executive director.</p>
        <p>The idea seemed to fade quickly, given that American courts might not be sympathetic and that it might look unseemly to pick a fight with the city that the I.O.C. chose to play host to the next Winter Games in 17 months.</p>
        <p>The latest confrontation occurred today when the Indonesian government criticized Samaranch for a letter he wrote this past April seeking the release of Hasan, the I.O.C. member, from jail. A powerful Asian track and field official, Hasan was also an associate of the deposed Indonesian president, Suharto. Hasan faces trial next week on charges of embezzling $87 million in state money. He has said he is not guilty.</p>
        <p>The existence of the letter written by Samaranch to Abdurrahman Wahid, the Indonesian president, was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
        <p>''It amazed me that they asked for this,'' the Indonesian attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, said of the I.O.C. to The Associated Press in Jakarta. ''The ethics involved are quite odd. It contravenes the spirit of the Olympics.''</p>
        <p>Some I.O.C. officials questioned Samaranch's sense of public relations for pressing the Australian government to allow Rakhimov and Ching into the country after it became clear they would not be granted visas.</p>
        <p>Other Olympic officials saw it as the I.O.C. meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign government. ''We looked stupid,'' said an I.O.C. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''We should have dropped it.''</p>
        <p>For the first time, at the Sydney Games, the I.O.C. will use blood testing to identify athletes who use performance-enhancing drugs, which are prohibited. As many as 40 athletes have been removed from various national Olympic teams for failing blood tests before leaving home. The Olympic committee, however, has said that it was having trouble finding athletes in Australian locations other than Sydney to administer the EPO tests.</p>
        <p>The test is also flawed, I.O.C. officials admit. Only athletes who fail both a blood test that detects EPO use over the previous three weeks and a urine test that detects use over the previous three days will face punishment.</p>
        <p>Some members have remained defiant in the face of the unremitting criticism. ''We are like ducks; the rain falls but does not touch us,'' said Prince Alexandre de Merode, an I.O.C. member from Belgium.</p>
        <p>But Gerhard Heiberg, a member from Norway, said the criticism was necessary and welcome. Ed Hula, the editor of an Olympic newsletter called Around the Rings, said the critical coverage reflected a heightened level of distrust of the I.O.C. in the news media since the Salt Lake City scandal.</p>
        <p>That is why the Sydney Games represent an important crossroads, said Cashman of the Center of Olympic Studies.</p>
        <p>''If the Games work out well, the I.O.C. will recover a bit of ground and Samaranch would go out on a positive note,'' Cashman said. ''The Olympic movement is fragile now in terms of credibility. If the Games don't go well, it could be immensely damaging.''</p>
