        <p>Soreness set in ever so subtly at the Rangers' camp in Burlington, Vt., yesterday as Mark Messier and Radek Dvorak removed themselves from a scrimmage because of stiffness.</p>
        <p>''It's nothing,'' said Messier, who has a sore left groin, and who described his removal as precautionary. ''It's a little bit stiff. So instead of trying to push through, I decided to take a half-day off so I will be fine. When you push through, that's when you pull something. It's just typical training camp soreness.''</p>

        <p>Soreness set in ever so subtly at the Rangers' camp in Burlington, Vt., yesterday as Mark Messier and Radek Dvorak removed themselves from a scrimmage because of stiffness.</p>
        <p>''It's nothing,'' said Messier, who has a sore left groin, and who described his removal as precautionary. ''It's a little bit stiff.

        <p>Dvorak, who complained of a stiff back, said, ''It's just a little tight; it's no big deal.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers will have their annual blue-white scrimmage tonight.</p>
        <p>''We're pretty committed that we're going to play the best 40 players we have,'' Coach Ron Low said. ''But it's questionable whether Mark or Dvorak will play.''</p>
