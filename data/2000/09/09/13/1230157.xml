        <p>It was supposed to be a stimulating group chat about the global economy, held here a few days before the opening of the Olympics to allow the corporate executives, central bankers and other notables to hop over to Sydney for some world-class sport.</p>
        <p>But in an eruption reminiscent of the violent protests at the World Trade Organization summit meeting in Seattle last November, thousands of protesters have tried to sabotage the meeting here of the World Economic Forum, clashing with riot police and blocking the conference site.</p>
        <p>The meeting has gone ahead more or less as planned, though on Monday about a quarter of the 900 delegates could not get into the hotel where it was being held because demonstrators had formed a human chain across every entrance. This morning riot police, some on horses, swung truncheons at protesters to clear a path for the delegates' buses.</p>
        <p>The organizers of the protests, a polyglot group of environmentalists and anti-free-trade activists, said that 50 people had been injured in the melee and that 11 were hospitalized. After seeming daunted by the crowd on Monday, the police used markedly stronger measures today.</p>
        <p>''What we have had over the past few days is not peaceful protest but something verging on riot, where we have had ball bearings, marbles, screws, glass and urine thrown at police officers,'' said Andre Haermeyer, the police minister of the Victoria state government.</p>
        <p>Australia's prime minister, John Howard, was forced to arrive at the site, the Crown Hotel and Casino, by boat because the police could not clear a path for his motorcade.</p>
        <p>For the Australian government, the protests have been an ugly scene-setter for the Olympics, which start on Friday, competing for the attention of the international news media with the torch relay and other festive preparations in Sydney.</p>
        <p>The protesters said they would rally at the Games as well, though it was difficult to imagine how an Olympic athlete could provoke as much outrage as a software billionaire like William H. Gates. Mr. Gates was the big name among speakers at the World Economic Forum, a private foundation whose last meeting, in Davos, Switzerland, was also disrupted by protests.</p>
        <p>The roar of the crowd eventually drew a response from conference participants. Asked during a panel discussion what he thought about the protests, Mr. Gates said, ''World trade, if you block it, the big losers will be the poor people of the world.''</p>
        <p>Christine Loh, a pro-democracy leader from Hong Kong who was turned back by the barricades, said: ''I think it inconvenienced a lot of people, which is what the protesters wanted to do. They've managed to make people more aware of the issues. I think it has been successful.''</p>
        <p>Greg Grodecki, 19, an environmental science student from Brisbane, Australia, said the goal was not to shut down the meeting, but to discourage future ones. ''We have been successful because these meetings are becoming too expensive, from a security point of view,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As the delegates filed into buses at the end of today's session, the cost of the blockade became more evident. Riot police again cleared a path, and the cavalcade inched onto the street under a shower of epithets and plastic bottles. A helicopter with a search light hovered overhead. Afterward, ambulances lined up to treat a handful of injured demonstrators.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates was forced to cancel two outside events, both demonstrations of a new Microsoft product, when the police warned him not to cross the street to a nearby office building.</p>
