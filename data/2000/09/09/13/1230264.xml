        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The New York City Board of Education's new teacher assignment policy of sending certified teachers only to the most troubled schools (news article, Sept. 7) is shortsighted.</p>
        <p>This policy will result in new teacher candidates' remaining uncertified in order to have a choice in where they will teach. Thus, the policy will have an effect that is the opposite of what Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, intended.</p>

        <p>While we try to solve the problems of the lowest-performing schools, the shortage of certified teachers in New York City will be worsened.</p>
