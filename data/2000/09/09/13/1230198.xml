        <p>FIRST, the confession: Bruce Raynor, the union leader who helped last week to end the long strike at the Museum of Modern Art, has never been to the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
        <p>''You probably shouldn't put that in the paper,'' he says. A reporter complains bitterly, of course. So he smiles and concedes: ''I guess it is too good not to put in, right?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Raynor is the secretary-treasurer of Unite -- the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, one of the largest manufacturing unions in North America. He knows a lot about wages and working conditions, bargaining and boycotts. He could not tell a Rauschenberg from a Rothko.</p>
        <p>''Whatever you know about art,'' he says, ''I guarantee you I know less.''</p>
        <p>The strikers who held out for more than four months against the museum -- art professionals with funky eyeglasses and titles like assistant curator -- are also not exactly the kind of strikers with whom Mr. Raynor is usually involved. And the museum is definitely not the kind of management he has come to know and hate over the years.</p>
        <p>Here are some more representative examples from his 27-year career as a union organizer:</p>
        <p>The time the shotgun was held on him in Andrews, S.C., during his first strike in 1973. The time he was thrown into jail for 10 days in Ohio and the jail turned out to be a whole lot nicer -- and warmer -- than the motel where he had been staying. The time his second marriage dissolved because he was too deeply involved in a labor battle. The time he helped lead the final push to unionize the Southern textile giant J. P. Stevens, the monumental organizing fight upon which the movie ''Norma Rae'' was based.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raynor, 50, when asked about what first drew him to the labor movement, what caused him to give up a badly needed biochemistry scholarship at Cornell University to study labor relations, is the kind of guy who is able to say things like this without a trace of post-1960's irony: ''Well, to change the world.''</p>
        <p>He grew up on Long Island. His father was a truck driver and laborer who died of a heart attack at age 40, while bowling. Before traveling to South Carolina for his first strike, Mr. Raynor had never been out of the Northeast. In fact, until he graduated from high school, he had never even been as far as New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''My family didn't have any money, so we didn't go on vacation. How would you go anywhere? I had been to New York; I had been to all five boroughs.''</p>
        <p>So when he got his first taste of small-town, still segregated, virulently anti-union South Carolina, the reaction was somewhat mutual. ''I had never seen anything like this place in my life,'' he said. ''And they looked at us like we were some kind of creatures from outer space. To say there was a lot of hostility is an understatement.''</p>
        <p>Which meant that Mr. Raynor found himself right at home. ''Growing up,'' he explains, ''I was not the biggest guy around. I was not a muscle man. But I would fight anybody.''</p>
        <p>For essentially the next two decades, until he moved back to the city two years ago, Bruce Raynor -- a guy who pronounces ''law'' the New York way, ''lawr'' -- was a dedicated Southerner. And despite some obvious limitations, he says, he loved it. ''I got to know a lot of very courageous people, people with very little power who stood up for themselves. I would move back in a heartbeat.''</p>
        <p>But there were the limitations. ''If someone asks you in a plane or a grocery store or a restaurant, 'What do you do?' and you tell them you're with a union, it ends the conversation. It's like saying, 'I'm a mass murderer. I kill people for a living.' ''</p>
        <p>And because both his second wife and the woman to whom he is now married, Joan, a homemaker and part-time parents' representative at a school, are black, there were other unspoken rules as well. ''There were some things you didn't do, some places you didn't go,'' he says. (Mr. Raynor and his wife now live in Nyack, N.Y., where they are raising five children.)</p>
        <p>During his time in the South, Mr. Raynor was instrumental in helping organize not only J. P. Stevens but also 5,200 workers at six Fieldcrest Cannon plants in Kannapolis, N.C., a vote that was considered the largest victory ever for labor in the South when the company's workers unionized last year.</p>
        <p>GOING to New York and to larger paperwork responsibilities -- he is expected to take over the union next year, when its president, Jay Mazur, resigns -- seems to have not slowed down Mr. Raynor's organizing duties. In fact, the night before the Museum of Modern Art negotiations, he had flown the red-eye back from Las Vegas, where the union had succeeded in organizing 1,600 laundry workers.</p>
        <p>The next night he was on his feet until a museum agreement was reached at 3 a.m. It was a strange role for Mr. Raynor: umpiring a game in which he has always been a fiercely partisan player.</p>
        <p>It was even stranger, considering that the museum workers had been using the Unite cafeteria as a headquarters during the strike. But Robert Batterman, the lawyer for the museum, said he asked for Mr. Raynor as mediator because he believed he could be fair.</p>
        <p>And this in spite of the conversation Mr. Raynor remembers the two men having just before the talks.</p>
        <p>''Bob said, 'Look, can I stop by? I need to talk to you.' And I said, 'Well, Bob, I don't think you'd better stop by because the museum workers are here and I can't guarantee your safety. They might accost you.' I was really more or less kidding.''</p>
