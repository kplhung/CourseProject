        <p>WHERE is everybody?</p>
        <p>That is the feeling in Sydney right now. No chanting crowds. No swarming hordes. No obvious rush of fresh money, newly arrived from overseas. Just peaceful streets, comfortable trains, empty stadiums.</p>
        <p>This tranquillity is far preferable to the steamy days and tacky nights of Atlanta 1996, when you couldn't walk on Peachtree Street because of the glut of tourists having a block party. The Sydney organizers looked at that unkempt scene and sniffed, ''Don't sweat it, mate, this won't happen in Sydney.'' Up to now, this looks like the anti-Atlanta.</p>
        <p>The Summer Games are only two days away, but the feeling has not reached critical mass. The Olympic Stadium will surely be jammed with 110,000 people, watching the Olympic flame during the opening ceremony on Friday night. Eighty percent of all tickets have been sold, within a couple of percentage points of the great record-setting glut in Atlanta four years ago. So far, Sydney is calm. Too calm for some.</p>
        <p>Mario Luongo is getting antsy. He comes from Turin, owns the Siena restaurant on Glebe Point Road, does a good business in normal times. Right now he is hurting.</p>
        <p>''I don't see people from overseas,'' Luongo was saying yesterday. ''The city is dead, and that is not just my opinion. We are struggling. I have no idea what is the problem.''</p>
        <p>My source in the city reported yesterday that the Meadowbank Ferry was nearly empty and that the panoramic film of Sydney at the Imax had maybe a dozen spectators.</p>
        <p>What Luongo and other merchants are discovering is normal for every Summer Games or World Cup of soccer. People who go to sports events do not necessarily patronize good restaurants or purchase artifacts or visit museums. Many of them buy a T-shirt and a beer, root and go home.</p>
        <p>Not only that, but sports hordes also scare away the locals. In Los Angeles before the 1984 Summer Games, there was so much gloom and doom that everybody who could vanished to Hawaii or Mammoth Lake or London. The freeways have never been so easy to negotiate.</p>
        <p>In Rome in 1990 for the World Cup, we rented an apartment in Piazza Sforza Cesarini, just across the river from the Vatican. My wife was regularly regaled with sad tales of deprivation by the owners of trattorias and specialty shops: ''Signora, tell your husband the reporter that there is nobody here. The soccer fans come in, they look at St. Peter's and they go to the game. They don't even buy a penne a la vodka or an insalata tricolore.''</p>
        <p>On the Monday night after the World Cup ended, every seat was taken in our favorite trattoria. The locals had returned from California or Greece or deep in the countryside where no soccer fan could find them.</p>
        <p>''We have beautiful customers,'' Luongo was saying yesterday. ''Maybe they have taken their kids on holiday. Every day we have two, four, six customers.''</p>
        <p>The authorities will say that hotel rooms are booked, that tickets are selling, but there have been empty seats on everybody's flights into town. Tomorrow is supposed to be the biggest influx for the Games -- perhaps 100,000 tourists from international flights. Then we will find out if the trains will really deliver the crowds to the new Olympic Park station. Some people are dubious.</p>
        <p>Right now, the ghost-town feeling is a good reminder for all cities that tinker with the idea of playing host to the Summer Games. There are even rumors from New York that some naifs are agitating for the city to be the host of a set of Summer Games somewhat later in this century. A Summer Games spread all over that fractious and balkanized region of bridges and tunnels? That will be the year when everybody goes to Sydney.</p>
        <p>Then there is the cost for all this largesse. The Sydney Olympic Park looks lovely at dusk, as the lights go on. Handsome new stadiums sprawl all over the former dumping grounds at Homebush Bay -- the Super Dome, the Olympic Stadium, the Hockey Center, the Tennis Center, the Aquatic Center, the Dome and Pavilions, the Baseball Stadium.</p>
        <p>When the crowds arrive -- and they will arrive -- it will all look good on NBC, two-thirds of a day later. But what is the cost for the privilege of providing a studio audience for worldwide television?</p>
        <p>''I hope we don't wind up like poor Montreal,'' said one Australian taxpayer yesterday, referring to the city that is still stuck with the bills from a party it gave 24 years ago.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mario Luongo has a table for you.</p>
