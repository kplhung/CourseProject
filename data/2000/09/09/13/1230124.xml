        <p>In take after take, Preity Zinta pivoted into the arms of Sunny Deol, bringing to life the heroic tale of an Indian policeman's struggle to win the love of his life. A 30-member film crew hovered  protectively to make sure that this  musical dream sequence, integral to  Indian cinema, was captured in perfection.</p>
        <p>The outdoor scenes for the movie, ''Farz,'' which means duty, were filmed in the Bernese Oberland in  central Switzerland, a tourist paradise of Alpine peaks and lakes. Many of the 800 to 900 films produced annually by the Indian movie industry are filmed at such spectacular scenic Swiss locations.</p>
        <p>The audience for these long, lavish odes to romance with diaphanous singing interludes is enormous, with  millions of Indians flocking to their village cinemas regularly for a few hours of romantic escape. The movies are also exported abroad for an estimated 25 million expatriate Indians.</p>
        <p>Most of the films are considered wholesome family entertainment because they have no sexually explicit scenes and usually have happy endings. They are known as masala, a combination of spices, for their blend of song-and-dance routines, glamorous stars, romance and stylized action sequences.</p>
        <p>They draw so many expatriate Indians in the United States and Britain that some theaters show Indian films exclusively. In Bern, the Swiss capital, a movie house opened recently to cater not only to immigrants but also to a growing number of Indian tourists who travel to Switzerland to take in the scenery that has become so familiar on the movie screen.</p>
        <p>A half-dozen movie crews can be found at any one time in the Swiss Alps starting in late April or early May, when snow remains on the mountains but the roads are passable. Typically, the crews film for a week or two, mostly at ski resorts like Lenk, Gstaad, Interlaken or St. Moritz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deol, a screen idol in India, is best known for his roles in the action films ''Border'' and ''Ghatah.'' Ms.  Zinta has acted in films for just  three years but already has traveled to Switzerland for five movies, among them ''Dil Se,'' described in The Sunday Telegraph of London as a '' terrorist action musical adventure film,'' and ''Kya Kehna,'' atypical in that it centers on an unmarried pregnant woman who decides to have her baby.</p>
        <p>The latter two films spent longer on the Top 10 movie list in Britain this year than ''Battlefield Earth'' with John Travolta and ''Saving Grace'' with Brenda Blethyn.</p>
        <p>Like most Indian films, ''Farz'' is  a modern-day tale focusing on the hopes and trials of middle-class people.</p>
        <p>Why pack off a crew of 30 and two stars to Switzerland, one of the most expensive countries in the world?  ''We can't get proper glaciers in India, or proper facilities or weather,''  said N. R. Pachisia, a co-producer of ''Farz.'' ''It's often too humid there.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''We're not so comfortable going to Kashmir,'' the disputed mountainous border region between India and Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Yet Vikram Bhatt, in Switzerland to direct an as-yet-unnamed drama about a couple fleeing what is now Pakistan during the partitioning of British India, said that filming in Switzerland was cost-effective.</p>
        <p>''India is far more costly because travel is more expensive,'' he said.  ''Certain areas are difficult politically and mountains are far.''</p>
        <p>In shooting picturesque village scenes, Indian producers rely on local Swiss companies to obtain the necessary visas and government approval, then negotiate with individual farmers or villages.</p>
        <p>''Its not very bureaucratic here,'' said Mr. Bhatt, who is filming near Gstaad. Swiss companies ferry crews around, provide Indian food, attend to medical needs and, for Mr. Bhatt's movie, provide train rails. The actors were filmed with the rails in the background as if they were walking by while a train was stopped. Scenes with a 1947 train were added later in a Bombay studio.</p>
        <p>It is estimated that ''Farz'' will cost about $3 million; if it is a hit it will net $5 million, a small amount by Hollywood standards but a comfortable cushion that will encourage the Indian production company to pursue other foreign locations.</p>
        <p>Indian moviemakers are starting to film stories with scenes in locations that are obviously not Indian, and Bern and London are becoming especially popular sites.</p>
        <p>But most of the masala films offer resolutely beautiful fantasy and outdoor scenes, leading to the question of whether the audience knows that what is being shown a different country.</p>
        <p>''It's meant to be happening in India, but audiences know it's not,'' said Raj Kanwar, director of ''Farz.''  ''Switzerland is the most fantastic place from the pictorial point of view. It looks just like Kashmir.''</p>
