        <p>AS the dishes of other countries become part of American cooking vernacular, so do the ingredients that define them. Curry leaves, which are used in Indian, Sri Lankan and Malaysian cooking, are beginning to appear in mainstream cookbooks just as Mexican cilantro and Southeast Asian kaffir lime leaves did a while ago.</p>
        <p>Mustard seeds and dried red chilies, two other Indian staples, are common enough,  but curry leaves have no familiar reference. And they are not related to curry powder. Once you taste them, you realize they have no substitute.</p>
        <p>Curry leaves are sold on their thin stems. The leaves look like bay, the fronds like ferns. Small, soft and waxy, the curry leaf has a powerful toasty aroma, layered with green pepper and citrus. It is not a fleeting aroma but one that is deep and heady, and pronounced in every dish it touches.</p>
        <p>''They are absolutely one of the best things,'' said Madhur Jaffrey, author of ''Madhur Jaffrey's World Vegetarian'' (Clarkson Potter, 1999). ''I keep hoping it will be the next lemon grass of America.''</p>
        <p>She gives curry leaves to chefs, and when she has guests, she said, ''I put it on their napkin, a whole spray of it, so they can crush it and smell it and see just how wonderful its aroma can be.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jaffrey uses them not just in Indian dishes but Western ones, too. For pasta, she seasons a tomato sauce with mustard seeds, red chili and curry leaves. When stir-frying shrimp, she adds curry leaves to the oil.</p>
        <p>This is an easy herb to incorporate, potent but not too assertive. I inserted them in  slices in fingerling potatoes, as I would bay leaves, before tossing the potatoes in peanut oil and braising them with a few cloves of garlic. For soup, I combined curry leaves with a few slow-roasted tomatoes and onions, a little water and a pinch of cumin.</p>
        <p>The leaves, which offer a touch of bitterness once cooked, helped balance the tomatoes' sweetness. They were also delicious sprinkled on roasted eggplant, which was soft and caramely and needed a powerful herb (which is why eggplant is so often paired with rosemary or thyme).</p>
        <p>With dishes that have a sauce or a broth, the leaves should be added whole to allow their flavor to seep out slowly. When sauteing, they are best added to the oil as it heats so that the flavor is infused in it and then the whole dish.</p>
        <p>Curry leaves are usually sold in plastic packages and will keep in the refrigerator for a week. In tropical regions of India, the curry plant is grown in backyards and in pots inside homes so, like the laurel tree in  many French homes, it is always at hand.</p>
        <p>Fresh curry leaves are available at Indian markets. A package of four to five stems is $1.49 at Kalustyan's, 123 Lexington Avenue (28th Street); (212) 685-3451.</p>
        <p>CARROT AND WATERCRESS SALAD  Adapted from ''Sophie Grigson's Herbs'' (BBC Consumer Publishing, 1999)  Time: 15 minutes</p>
        <p>2 medium carrots, peeled and grated  1 large handful watercress, trimmed  Large pinch sea salt; more to taste  2 tablespoons peanut oil  20 curry leaves  1 teaspoon black mustard seeds</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds  Lime juice, to taste.</p>
        <p>1. In a medium heatproof bowl, combine  carrots, watercress and salt.</p>
        <p>2. In a small saute pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add curry leaves and mustard seeds. As soon as mustard seeds begin to pop, take pan off heat and add cumin seeds. Return pan to heat, cover and let seeds pop for about 10 seconds more. Remove from heat and pour mixture over carrots and watercress. Toss to mix. Add about 1 tablespoon lime juice. Toss again. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more salt, oil and lime juice as desired.</p>
        <p>Yield: 3 servings.</p>
