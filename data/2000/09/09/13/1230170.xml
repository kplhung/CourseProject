        <p>American Airlines, the nation's second-largest airline, said yesterday that it would rearrange flights at its two largest hubs to improve its overall reliability after this summer's high number of delays and cancellations.</p>
        <p>American said that it would slow the number of arrivals and departures and add more time between connecting flights at its hubs in Dallas and Chicago. And in a bolder step, the airline plans to ''isolate'' its operations at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, which it said was one of its most unreliable hubs, so that delays there will not upset its flights elsewhere in the country.</p>
        <p>''What we're doing, in fact, is building a firewall between our O'Hare operation and the rest of our network so if there's a snowstorm in Chicago it won't affect your flight from New York to Dallas,'' said Donald J. Carty, the chief executive of the AMR Corporation, American's parent.</p>
        <p>The changes, which will take effect Oct. 1, appear to take into account criticisms made by the Federal Aviation Administration, air traffic controllers and some members of Congress that the major airlines contribute to delays by scheduling more flights at peak hours than the air traffic system can handle.</p>
        <p>''The accusation that airlines overschedule is absolutely true,'' Mr. Carty said yesterday at a meeting with Wall Street analysts in Manhattan. His statement contradicted the long-held position of the Air Transport Association, the airline industry lobby. The association's current chairman is none other than Mr. Carty himself.</p>
        <p>As delays have increased in recent years, other airlines have also tried revamping their schedules to improve on-time performance -- with mixed results. For example, at Newark International Airport, Continental Airlines has shifted flights frequented mostly by holiday travelers to off-peak times to relieve congestion during the busy morning and afternoon hours, when business travelers most want to fly. Newark has now moved from being the airport with the most  delays to being the fourth worst, said Greg Brenneman, Continental's president.</p>
        <p>United Airlines, the country's largest airline, extended the scheduled length of all its flights this summer after it experienced a steep decline in on-time performance. Indeed, the Transportation Department's inspector general recently concluded that such schedule stretching over the last decade had succeeded in masking how greatly airline delays have grown.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carty said that American planned to eliminate some morning flights at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, its biggest hub, and extend its operations at the airport by about 30 minutes each day to give its passengers and employees ''a little bit more breathing room.''</p>
        <p>American has been making minor changes to its schedule to make it run more smoothly for years. Finally, several months ago, its operations staff decided to start from scratch. After running computer models, they were surprised to learn that they could make changes that would not only increase on-time performance but also enable their jets to spend more time in the air carrying passengers.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Carty said that the changes at O'Hare would enable American to fit nine more flights into its schedule using the same number of aircraft it flies today.</p>
        <p>Cutting off its O'Hare flights from the rest of its nationwide network means that American jets will fly back and forth between Chicago and their destinations rather than connecting to other airports from Chicago, as they do now.</p>
        <p>For many passengers, the changes may be invisible. ''The guy in Burbank who never understood why a snowstorm in Chicago affected his flight to Atlanta will probably never know the difference because his flight will now simply get to Atlanta,'' said Timothy J. Doke, an American spokesman.</p>
        <p>The extent of the improvements that will result from the changes remains to be seen. And despite American's latest moves, Mr. Carty did not hold out much hope that overall reliability of the airline industry would improve significantly during future peak travel seasons.</p>
        <p>''The next two summers are going to be pretty ugly,'' he said, until some new air traffic control technology comes into use. He attributed much of this summer's problems to high demand, unusual weather and a covert job action by pilots at United Airlines. American suffered similar disruption last year when hundreds of its pilots called in sick.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carty also commented on recent speculation that British Airways, American's principal European partner, might be forced to back out of its deal with American to complete its proposed merger with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.</p>
        <p>''Even absent the comprehensive deal we seek with B.A., we are, from an alliance standpoint, well positioned in Europe,'' he said, referring to American's partnerships with Swissair and Sabena of Belgium.</p>
        <p>The American-British Airways alliance has been stalled by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for four years because of fears that it would give the two airlines too strong a position at Heathrow Airport near London. KLM has a much closer partnership with Northwest Airlines that would be difficult to unravel, leading many analysts to say that British Airways would link up with Northwest instead of American.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Carty said that British Airways might find that buying KLM would nullify the antitrust immunity now enjoyed by KLM and Northwest, making a British Airways-KLM partnership less attractive.</p>
