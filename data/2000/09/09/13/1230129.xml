        <p>Re ''Tribulations and Triumphs in Sports'' (editorial, Sept. 12):</p>
        <p>I have just one question concerning Indiana University's dismissal of its basketball coach, Bob Knight. Would a member of any other collegiate department have been able to abuse students and remain employed like Mr. Knight? I think not. Bob Knight should have been fired a long time ago, but clearly, ticket sales were more important.</p>
