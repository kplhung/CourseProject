        <p>THE all-fat-is-bad theory of eating has gone the way of the grapefruit diet, but the calories-do-count theory is still with us. And that leaves fried foods where they have always been, generally out of reach for those who would prefer not to gain weight. Still, the results of perfect deep frying are hard to resist: most people prefer a plateful of French fries to boiled potatoes.</p>
        <p>Some time ago I figured out how to get that irresistible flavor of French fries without actually frying the potatoes. Roasting them at a high temperature in a light coating of oil provides much of the same crispness and crunch with far less grease. Not to mention far less mess.</p>

        <p>THE all-fat-is-bad theory of eating has gone the way of the grapefruit diet, but the calories-do-count theory is still with us. And that leaves fried foods where they have always been, generally out of reach for those who would prefer not to gain weight. Still, the results of perfect deep frying are hard to resist: most people prefer a plateful of French fries to boiled potatoes.</p>
        <p>Some time ago I figured out how to get that irresistible flavor of French fries without actually frying the potatoes. Roasting them at a high temperature in a light coating of oil provides much of the same crispness and crunch with far less grease. Not to mention far less mess.</p>
        <p>This summer I decided to put other vegetables to the ''oven fried'' test: zucchini, green tomatoes and eggplant.</p>
        <p>Unlike potatoes, those vegetables are filled with water, so roasting them at high heat simply softens them. They need a coating to provide crispness, something that will actually toast and turn brown.</p>
        <p>Flour, bread crumbs and egg whites all work wonders in oven-frying vegetables. Just as in deep frying, the bread and flour have properties that allow them to be toasted and browned. The egg whites, like whole eggs, help the coating stick to the food.</p>
        <p>For sliced eggplant, egg whites and bread crumbs were all that were needed to provide a crunchy coating. But I enhanced the flavor with thin slices of melted Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p>
        <p>Green tomatoes, the juiciest of the vegetables, needed a relatively thick coating to seal in the liquid and allow the coating to brown. Adding a little garlic and cayenne to the batter makes them even better. I also tried laying a leaf of basil on each slice of tomato before cooking, and it was a  delicious touch, although I doubt any Southerner would ever entertain such a radical idea.</p>
        <p>Zucchini can be oven-fried in the same kind of batter.</p>
        <p>All these ''fried'' vegetables taste great just as they are, hot out of the oven. But the zucchini and tomatoes are excellent with a yogurt sauce, curried or dill, while the eggplant could be put between good Italian bread to make a sandwich.</p>
        <p>Oven-frying beets and sweet potatoes is easiest of all, using the same technique as with white potatoes, because all three have little moisture.</p>
        <p>Peel the beets and sweet potatoes, and cut into slices less than an eighth of an inch thick. Season them with salt. Spray a nonstick pan with cooking spray, arrange the slices on the pan and spray again. Roast on the top shelf of a preheated 450-degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes, turning once. They will be crisp but tender,  and you will want to eat them like potato chips.</p>
        <p>So go right ahead.</p>
        <p>'OVEN FRIED' EGGPLANT  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>Pan spray  1 medium-large eggplant  3 egg whites  2 cups flour  Salt and pepper to taste  1 cup fine dry bread crumbs  5 to 6 slices Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Spray a large baking sheet with pan spray.</p>
        <p>2. Cut eggplant crosswise into  1/4-inch-thick slices. Beat egg whites in shallow bowl. Place flour in second shallow dish, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Dip slices first in egg whites, then in flour, then in egg whites and finally in bread crumbs. Arrange slices on prepared baking sheet, and spray with pan spray. Roast on top shelf of oven about 15 minutes. Turn once, top with very thin slices of Parmigiano-Reggiano and return to oven for a minute or two until cheese melts and bubbles.</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 to 3 servings.</p>
        <p>'OVEN FRIED' ZUCCHINI  Time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>1 cup flour  2 tablespoons oil  Salt to taste  Pan spray  2 medium-large zucchini  2 egg whites.</p>
        <p>1. In a bowl, mix flour with 1 cup water, the oil and salt to taste. Let stand 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Pan spray a nonstick baking sheet.</p>
        <p>3. Slice zucchini  1/8 inch thick. Beat egg whites until soft peaks form, then fold into batter. Dip each zucchini slice in batter, and place on prepared pan. Roast on top shelf of oven about 10 minutes, until slices are browned on the bottoms, then turn and roast another few minutes.</p>
        <p>Yield: 3 to 4 servings.</p>
        <p>'FRIED' GREEN TOMATOES  Time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>1 cup flour plus extra for coating tomatoes  2 tablespoons oil  Salt and pepper to taste  Pan spray  2 egg whites  6 medium-large green tomatoes  Crushed garlic to taste  Cayenne pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Mix flour with 1 cup water, oil and salt and pepper to taste in a shallow bowl, and allow to sit for 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Spray 2 baking sheets with pan spray. Beat egg whites until soft peaks form, and fold into the flour mixture. Have more flour mixed with lots of salt ready in a second dish.</p>
        <p>3. Slice top and bottom off tomatoes, and cut each into inch-thick slices. Sprinkle with garlic and cayenne. Dip slices in flour, then in batter. Place on baking sheet.</p>
        <p>4. Roast on top shelf of oven until bottoms are browned, about 10 minutes. Spray tops with pan spray, and turn over. Return to oven and continue roasting another 5 minutes, until crumbs brown.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
