        <p>FOR decades in this country, the most beloved condiment was ketchup, bottled ketchup. But the American palate woke up, a great national craving for a spicy Mexican sauce took hold, and ultimately it supplanted ketchup in many homes.</p>
        <p>It was salsa. But lately it, too, has come perilously close to commonplace -- bottled and consistent and without much variety. The fact is that even if you limit yourself to the various regions of Mexico for inspiration -- and ignore Spain or even Sicily -- salsas are too numerous to count, bursting with invention and surprise.</p>
        <p>And it's not just true of traditional salsas. Chefs across the country have continued to take salsa to new levels, and their ideas are easy to adapt to the home kitchen. By preparing just a few of these widely different salsas (the Spanish word simply means sauce), you can get a sense of the breathtaking possibilities.</p>
        <p>There's the familiar tomato salsa, with tomato, onion, chili and cilantro. Less familiar is the salsa verde, with its tomatillo base. But a great salsa doesn't have to have tomatoes in it, or even chilies. Some are cooked, some aren't. Some reach for combinations that you've probably never experienced before, like black beans and peaches, or toasted almonds and fresh herbs. One thing all salsas have is bite, and they have the remarkable capacity to breathe life into the simplest grilled fish or meat.</p>
        <p>And one other thing: for the most part, they are much easier to prepare than they seem. To me, salsas are especially appealing when they are made from uncooked ingredients. The basis of most raw salsas is a chopped, pounded or nearly pureed vegetable, herb or fruit, made superflavorful by the addition of some combination of onion, garlic, lime or lemon juice. Many also incorporate more than one herb, shallots, spices and, of course, chilies. The best combinations are quite moist -- so if tomato or a juicy fruit is not one of the basic ingredients, a great deal of citrus juice usually makes up for it. Salsas are thin-textured and informal, but they are fresh, colorful and beautiful on the plate.</p>
        <p>Chefs understand these things, and are always experimenting: there are only so many ways you can grill a piece of fish, meat or chicken, but the salsas you can serve them with are unlimited. In some ways, asking a chef which salsa to serve with which dish is an exercise in futility, not unlike asking the short-order cook which dish to serve with ketchup. (The short answer: almost anything.)</p>
        <p>Still, chefs do tend to serve salsas and other strong sauces with grilled food, and that's a good guideline: when even a mild meat or fish is well browned, it gains enough backbone to support a spicy sauce.</p>
        <p>Raw salsas retain the strong, bold flavors of their basic components, especially garlic and chilies. And because these flavors can sometimes be overpowering, many chefs make salsas with roasted chilies. ''I hardly do any salsas that are completely uncooked,'' said Rick Bayless, the chef and owner of Frontera Grill in Chicago. Roasting tames the heat of many chilies, and brings out more subtle flavors. But Mr. Bayless has his no-cook salsa, too: a tomato and fruit version that features uncooked habaneros, the fiery, complex little pepper also known as Scotch bonnet.</p>
        <p>Chipotles (smoked jalapenos) also need no roasting, since they've already been mellowed by smoke. ''And,'' said Mark Miller, the chef and owner of Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, N.M., ''if you buy canned chipotles in adobo, you already have the added flavors of tomato and vinegar, so you're halfway to making a great-tasting salsa already.'' Mr. Miller combines a puree of chipotle in adobo with fresh fruit to make a salsa for grilled or roasted pork or dark-fleshed fish.</p>
        <p>Zarela Martinez, the chef and owner of Zarela in Manhattan, reminded me that one of the most basic and important salsas, chile pastor -- a thin sauce that is not unlike a coarse pesto -- is an uncooked blend of chilies, lime, onions and herbs. One of her green salsas combines jalapeno, tomatillos and avocado for a kind of light, spicy guacamole that is a good dip or sauce.</p>
        <p>Fresh, raw salsa can, of course, be made with no chilies at all. A good example of this is one created by Susanne Goin at Lucques in West Hollywood, Calif. ''I start with a basic chopped salsa verde,'' she said, ''and add either almonds, which makes it perfect for grilled fish, or shards of feta, which I like to serve with chunks of skewered and grilled lamb. You can also add hard-cooked egg to the sauce and use it for salmon.''</p>
        <p>That's the thing about salsa. Once you get started, there's almost no limit to what you can put together with no cooking at all.</p>
        <p>GREEN SAUCE WITH AVOCADO  Adapted from Zarela Martinez  Time: 15 minutes</p>
        <p>2 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped  1 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste  1 small white onion, coarsely chopped  2 fresh serrano or jalapeno chilies, or to taste, stemmed, seeded and coarsely chopped  6 to 8 tomatillos (about  1/2 pound), husks removed, and quartered  1 ripe avocado  8 to 10 cilantro sprigs.</p>
        <p>1. In a food processor or with mortar and pestle, process or pound the garlic and salt to a paste. Add onion, chilies and tomatillos; pulse in processor or pound to make a slightly chunky paste.</p>
        <p>2. Scoop out the avocado flesh. For a smooth machine-finished puree, add it and the cilantro to the processor and process very fine. To do it by hand, finely chop the avocado and mash it into the onion-tomatillo mixture; stir in cilantro leaves. (For a medium texture, pour the machine-processed onion-tomatillo mixture into a bowl, and mix in the chopped avocado and cilantro.)</p>
        <p>3. Serve immediately as a dip or a sauce with chips or vegetables.</p>
        <p>Yield: About 2 1/2 cups.</p>
        <p>SALSA VERDE WITH NUTS  Adapted from Susanne Goin  Time: 15 minutes</p>
        <p>1 anchovy, preferably packed in salt, rinsed and cleaned  2 cloves garlic, peeled  1 tablespoon capers  1 teaspoon fresh marjoram leaves</p>
        <p>1/4 cup mint, chopped  1 cup parsley leaves, tightly packed</p>
        <p>3/4 cup olive oil, more or less</p>
        <p>1/4 cup chopped or slivered almonds, preferably toasted.</p>
        <p>1. In a food processor or with a mortar and pestle, pulse or pound the anchovy and garlic to a paste, then add capers, and then the herbs until everything is coarsely pureed. Be careful not to overprocess.</p>
        <p>2. Add the olive oil a bit at a time until mixture is smooth and saucy. Taste, and add more oil if necessary. Stir in nuts, and serve with fish.</p>
        <p>Yield: About 1 cup.</p>
        <p>TOMATO SALSA WITH FRUIT  Adapted from Rick Bayless  Time: 25 minutes</p>
        <p>1 small red onion, finely chopped  2 tablespoons lime juice  1 1/2 cups tomatoes, in  1/4-inch dice  1 habanero chili, or to taste, seeded, stemmed and minced</p>
        <p>1/3 cup chopped cilantro (stems are O.K.)</p>
        <p>3/4 cup chopped ripe mango, peach, nectarine or pear, in  1/4-inch dice  Salt as needed.</p>
        <p>1. Soak onion in the lime juice for 20 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.</p>
        <p>2. Combine the tomato, chili, cilantro and fruit. When the onion is ready, stir it in, along with some salt. Add more lime juice if necessary, and serve with duck, chicken, grilled halibut or other fish.</p>
        <p>Yield: About 2 cups.</p>
        <p>BLACK BEAN AND PEACH SALSA  Time: 15 minutes</p>
        <p>1 cup cooked black beans, drained (and rinsed, if from a can)  1 cup peach, mango or papaya, cut into  1/2-inch dice  1 small red onion, peeled and minced</p>
        <p>1/2 red bell pepper, minced  1 tablespoon ground cumin</p>
        <p>1/4 cup fresh lime juice  1 small chili (or more), preferably habanero, seeded, stemmed, minced  Salt to taste.</p>
        <p>Combine ingredients. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Let sit 5 minutes or so, and serve with white-fleshed fish or chicken.</p>
        <p>Yield: About 2 cups.</p>
        <p>HERB AND SHALLOT SALSA  Time: 15 minutes</p>
        <p>1 cup tightly packed chopped herbs like parsley, cilantro or mint leaves, alone or in any combination</p>
        <p>1/2 cup peeled and chopped shallots  1 small jalapeno or other hot chili (or more to taste), seeded, stemmed and minced  Juice of 2 limes  1 teaspoon ground cumin  Salt and freshly ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>In a small bowl, combine all ingredients and let sit 5 minutes. If mixture seems thick, thin with a little water, neutral oil (like canola or corn oil) or additional lime juice. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve with grilled meat, chicken or fish.</p>
        <p>Yield: About 1 cup.</p>
        <p>FRUIT SALSA WITH CHIPOTLE PUREE  Adapted from Mark Miller  Time: 15 minutes, plus up to 1 hour's resting time</p>
        <p>2 cups pineapple, peach or nectarine, cut into  1/4-inch dice</p>
        <p>1/2 cup red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and cut into  1/4-inch dice  2 teaspoons pureed canned chipotle chilies in adobo  2 teaspoons fresh orange juice  1 tablespoon fresh lime juice  2 tablespoons minced cilantro  2 teaspoons brown sugar.</p>
        <p>In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients; let rest for at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour. Serve with pork or dark-fleshed fish.</p>
        <p>Yield: About 2 cups.</p>
