        <p>Before Vice President Al Gore set foot on the stage this afternoon in front of a raucous crowd of 2,000 supporters at Cincinnati State Technical and Community College, there came The Testimonial.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore has been a friend of mine for almost 15 years, and he's a man of family and faith,'' Senator Joseph I. Lieberman told the already enthusiastic audience. ''Al Gore is a man of courage.''</p>
        <p>This scene has quickly become a chestnut for the Democrats' national ticket, repeated with slight variations from city to city and very likely to be heard again Wednesday when the two men travel to Boston. More than any other presidential and vice-presidential nominee in recent memory -- with the possible exception of Mr. Gore and President Clinton in 1992 -- Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman have made a habit of appearing in tandem.</p>
        <p>The practice defies the conventional wisdom that running mates should split up to cover as many electoral bases as possible. But campaign officials say it will continue through November, reflecting the benefits they believe Mr. Lieberman has brought to the ticket, benefits that Gore aides concede have exceeded their hopes.</p>
        <p>The Democrats see tactical advantages in joint campaigning, but the most compelling factor may be the one Gore aides are least comfortable addressing openly: It is clear, they agree, that Mr. Lieberman loosens up the famously stiff vice president, making him a more effective candidate.</p>
        <p>''They're good friends, and campaigning is a stressful experience that's easier when it's shared with someone,'' said Tad Devine, a senior strategist for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Donna Brazile, Mr. Gore's campaign manager, said, ''They just enjoy each other. You may even see some foursomes out there, with the spouses.''</p>
        <p>His aides say that Mr. Gore may not be adept at whipping up a crowd, but that he performs best before groups that are already enthusiastic. Mr. Lieberman, they say, effectively gets audiences ready for the vice president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's easy manner and constant joking leaven Mr. Gore's tendency toward seriousness, and the vice president, like others on the campaign, has not escaped his teasing. At a recent forum in Portland, Ore., Mr. Gore, noting that his wife, Tipper, had a master's degree in psychology, said that in recent years, ''Her psychology practice is almost entirely devoted to me.''</p>
        <p>''For which she is not adequately reimbursed, I might add,'' Mr. Lieberman interjected.</p>
        <p>Today, the candidates rolled through Ohio aboard a pair of yellow school buses to highlight their plans for improving education in this critical swing state. They made no new proposals, choosing instead to re-emphasize long-held positions on reducing class sizes, increasing testing of both students and teachers, expanding the federal Head Start program to provide preschool for 4-year-olds and some 3-year-olds, and offering tax credits for college tuition.</p>
        <p>The day was largely dedicated to stagecraft, as the candidates took questions from students at Anna K. Wantz Middle School in Miamisburg, basked in the adulation of cheerleaders and band members in the gymnasium at Middletown High School and spoke at a rally here. They were followed by the campaign's own camera crew, filming them together for possible use in future television ads.</p>
        <p>''Even to those of us out here watching on TV, it's been striking how much they've campaigned together,'' said Theodore J. Lowi, a professor of political science at Cornell University.</p>
        <p>Since the Democratic convention last month, Mr. Lieberman has made campaign appearances on 19 days. On 12 of those days, including the four-day boat tour he and Mr. Gore took down the Mississippi River, he has made at least one appearance with the vice president, and often two or three a day.</p>
        <p>By contrast, in the same period, Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential nominee, has campaigned with Gov. George W. Bush on four days.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people still have this feeling that Gore isn't quite sincere, that he's too serious, he's too cautious'' Mr. Lowi said. ''Lieberman brings that Hubert Humphrey-like joy to the experience of campaigning, and he sounds like he really believes what he's saying.</p>
        <p>''And he's a living reminder to people that Gore can make a very bold, very well-received move,'' Mr. Lowi said. ''That is, picking Lieberman.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman is best known for criticizing Mr. Clinton's private behavior, for opposing vulgarity and violence in popular entertainment, and for talking frequently about his own Jewish faith. Mr. Gore's aides have made no secret that it was his reputation as a morally upstanding man, as much as anything else, that appealed to the vice president, whose own image has been sullied somewhat by questions about improper fund-raising in the 1996 campaign.</p>
        <p>''He can talk about Gore as a first-hand witness and credential him as a person and as a leader in a very credible way,'' Mr. Devine said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's main role in their joint appearances has been to introduce the vice president with boasts about his accomplishments. And he is performing an important service for a presidential candidate whose own bragging -- like his claim to having a hand in creating the Internet -- has sometimes been clumsy and, however accurate, widely mocked. Mr. Lieberman reminds audiences that Mr. Gore volunteered for service in Vietnam, that he supported an overhaul of welfare, that he voted for United States entry into the Persian Gulf war, and that he helped preside over a booming economy.</p>
        <p>''I don't think anybody who is fair would disagree with this comment,'' Mr. Lieberman said today, ''that Al Gore has been the most effective and successful vice president in the history of the United States of America.''</p>
