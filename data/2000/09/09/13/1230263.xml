        <p>I agree with Mr. Levy that the bureaucratic hurdles for new teachers must be lessened, and I also agree that salaries and working conditions must be commensurate with other professions'. But let me add another way that the quality of the teaching force can be improved.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Why the Best Don't Teach,'' by Harold O. Levy (Op-Ed, Sept. 9):</p>
        <p>I agree with Mr. Levy that the bureaucratic hurdles for new teachers must be lessened, and I also agree that salaries and working conditions must be commensurate with other professions'. But let me add another way that the quality of the teaching force can be improved.</p>
        <p>Along with 30 other colleagues, I retired from teaching at a large public high school in June. We retired after years of success in the classroom and years of professional accomplishments.</p>
        <p>We were not encouraged to stay to mentor our younger colleagues but were offered monetary incentives to leave. That decision was a mistake, because it is possible to train teachers on the job, or at least through an intensive but minimal summer program.</p>
