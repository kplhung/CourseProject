        <p>In the final minute of the first half on Sunday, Amani Toomer started from the Eagles' 25-yard line, slanting from the line of scrimmage toward the center of the Philadelphia defense. As the defenders peered toward the Giants' backfield and their suddenly dangerous running attack, and they spied Kerry Collins pumping his arm once, Toomer sailed toward the end zone all alone.</p>
        <p>Talking about the play a day later, even Toomer was uncertain how he was able to get so wide open. He could ask his fellow receiver, Ike Hilliard, who less than a quarter later, ran into the end zone with an even larger gap between himself and a defender.</p>
        <p>Toomer had an idea of what provided him with the cushion that was unusual for a National Football League game, and it had little to do with the move he made or the subtle pump-fake by his quarterback. What Toomer identified as the best friend the receivers had is the same thing that may cause their statistics to drop this season -- a running game that can finally draw the attention of the defense.</p>
        <p>''It can be anything any week,'' Toomer said. ''That's what this team is built around, getting the right people in the right spots and everybody just playing their part.''</p>
        <p>Toomer and Hilliard embarked on a record-setting season a year ago, becoming the first two Giants to combine for more than 2,100 yards receiving in a season. After catching just 44 passes in his first three years, Toomer caught a team-record 79 passes last season for 1,183 yards, the second-highest total in franchise history. Hilliard caught 72 balls for 996 yards, placing him third on the franchise's career list for passes caught in a season.</p>
        <p>But the reputation they carried into this season also made them marked men. With the Arizona Cardinals striving to take them out of the offense, the running game flourished. But Toomer had just 4 receptions for 45 yards while Hilliard grabbed 3 passes for 62 yards, and neither player reached the end zone. Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne grabbed the spotlight and the receivers waited their turn.</p>
        <p>Their turn came the next game, as Hilliard caught 8 passes for 84 yards and a touchdown and Toomer grabbed 7 passes for 80 yards and another score, as the Giants beat the Eagles, 33-18.</p>
        <p>''We ran for so many yards against Arizona,'' Toomer said. ''That had a lot to do with why we didn't catch many balls. They were playing coverage on me and Ike. So, if they do come with those coverages, our offense has to attack in another direction.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we planned to go to us so much more this week. I think that's just what opened up. The week before, we went into the game and looked at the advantages that we had and we felt like we could take advantage of them running the ball. This week, we felt like they had a good front and we needed to even it out a little more.''</p>
        <p>In the second game, the Giants again built an early lead and did not have to pass as much as they normally might. That is a situation the Giants may find themselves in once more, facing the Chicago Bears this week. The Bears rank 30th in the N.F.L. in rushing defense over the first two weeks, ahead of only the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
        <p>''I'm not worried about the numbers,'' Toomer said. ''It doesn't really matter. They're going to have to try to take away something. If they take away us, we're going to run for 300 yards. If they don't, we're going to pass for 300 yards. It just depends on what the team is comfortable with.''</p>
        <p>Another difference for the Giants receivers this year is that for the first time in Toomer's five years with the team, there is no doubt about who is starting at quarterback. And even if the Giants receivers do not get the ball as much as they did last season, Toomer knows that he will occasionally find himself open in a way that he is unaccustomed to.</p>
        <p>''Usually, you don't get that open in this league,'' Toomer said. ''For some reason or another, I don't know what was going on with them. I'm not going to complain about it, but it's not really what you expect.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Giants added RAMOS McDONALD to the team's 53-man roster, signing the cornerback for the third time this season. McDonald was initially signed on waivers on Aug. 24, then was waived on Aug. 29. He was re-signed on Sept. 5, but waived on Sept. 9.</p>
