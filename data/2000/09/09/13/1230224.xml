        <p>With the Caribbean facing the highest rate of H.I.V. infection outside of sub-Saharan Africa, international donors and banks have pledged at least $120 million to support a regional strategy to combat the disease, they announced today.</p>
        <p>The announcement, which included a World Bank proposal for $85 million to $100 million in loans, came at the end of a conference on AIDS in the Caribbean at which many speakers emphasized that the epidemic  threatened to undo the social and economic development in the region.</p>
        <p>Official estimates put the number of H.I.V. and AIDS cases at 360,000, but many health experts said the actual number exceeded 500,000 because of underreporting.</p>
        <p>While the average rate of infection of the total population is about 2 percent -- compared with 8 percent in sub-Saharan Africa -- it has burdened the region's smaller economies. It has also forced political leaders to acknowledge the need to act, rather than to stay quiet because of fears of breaking taboos or scaring off the tourists that are a mainstay of many Caribbean economies.</p>
        <p>''We do not have a choice in the matter -- we must act now,'' said Prime Minister Owen Arthur of Barbados. ''The Caribbean has never lost a generation of its most talented young people because of war or natural disaster. It is in danger of doing so because of the pandemic of AIDS. With it goes the hope, promise and idealism of the best educated and most creative minds in the history of the Caribbean people.''</p>
        <p>The spread of the disease has been fueled by tourism, migration between islands, poverty, and religious and cultural resistance to the use of condoms and sex education. While Haiti and the Dominican Republic account for a vast majority of cases -- the infection rate is 12 percent in parts of Haiti -- growing concern about the spread of H.I.V. led the Caribbean Community to form an AIDS task force in 1998 to develop a regional plan to help members track and treat the disease.</p>
        <p>More new cases of H.I.V. infection were diagnosed in the region between 1995 and 1998 than in all the previous years since the disease was first identified, and as in Africa it is spread largely by heterosexual contact. In the English-speaking Caribbean it has become the leading cause of death for men and women aged 15 to 44.</p>
        <p>Yet many nations are spending only a fraction of what it costs for treatment and prevention. Current spending is about 10 percent of the estimated $258 million a year needed for effective regional treatment and prevention.</p>
        <p>The financing pledged today would bolster existing efforts by the Caribbean Community and its regional partners, while individual nations would be expected to review their own spending to see what costs could be covered in existing budgets.</p>
        <p>The United States, which has supported anti-AIDS programs in several of the worst-hit countries in the Caribbean, did not pledge a specific amount because of continuing budget discussions in Washington.</p>
        <p>While international aid will help combat the disease, Mr. Arthur underscored the need for a regional approach to build on longstanding collaborations in health, research and economic matters.</p>
        <p>''There has been stigma and discrimination,'' he said. ''There has been the usual Caribbean serendipity that the solution to the problem will be found elsewhere and applied here.''</p>
        <p>This week's conference is the latest in a series of recent events in which AIDS has dominated regional discussions. In June, during a meeting of Caribbean finance ministers in Washington, officials from the World Bank and international health organizations placed the disease and its threat in sobering context.</p>
        <p>The ministers learned of estimates that the cost of treating the disease, as well as the loss of life and income, could reduce gross domestic product in Jamaica by 6.4 percent and in Trinidad and Tobago by 4.2 percent by 2005.</p>
