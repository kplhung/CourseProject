        <p>The London Stock Exchange scrapped its proposal today to merge with the Frankfurt stock exchange, abandoning at least for now a vision of creating the first pan-European stock market.</p>
        <p>The decision put the future of stock trading in Europe in disarray and reflected the frustrations of melding financial markets with differing regulations, practices and monetary systems.</p>
        <p>Gaffes and misunderstandings about how the two exchanges would combine have plagued the merger plan since it was announced less than five months ago. Doubts about whether the merger would proceed as envisioned intensified after OM Gruppen, the company that runs Sweden's stock market, began a hostile takeover bid for the London exchange in August. The doubts grew further Monday, when the Deutsche Borse, parent of the Frankfurt exchange, canceled a shareholder vote meant to ratify the merger.</p>
        <p>The London exchange explained its decision to terminate the merger by saying it would allow exchange officials to concentrate on thwarting the hostile bid by OM Gruppen.</p>
        <p>The proposed London-Frankfurt exchange, which was to have been known as iX, had never gathered much support from professional traders. The announcement today was greeted with approval by some of the plan's most ardent critics. Many had been threatening to vote the London exchange's top executives out of office at a shareholders meeting Thursday.</p>
        <p>''We're pretty happy about this,'' said Brian Winterflood, founder of Winterflood Securities, a retail broker. ''If they hadn't done this, we're quite sure they would've been voted out of office.''</p>
        <p>A London-Frankfurt partnership has not been ruled out at a later date, said people close to the situation, although they added that the iX plan would not necessarily be revived in its current form should the London exchange succeed in fending off Swedish interest. More likely, a revised plan that more closely addresses shareholder concerns could be devised, these people said.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the London exchange said the decision to abandon iX was motivated by timing. Under the terms of the proposal, iX was to have been completed by Dec. 31, a deadline the spokeswoman said was unreasonable given the time required to fight OM's hostile bid.</p>
        <p>Yet it is possible that relations between London and Frankfurt have worn too thin to be salvaged. From its inception, iX has faced a series of strategic, political and public relations blunders.</p>
        <p>The structure of iX has been particularly sensitive. Constituents in London and Frankfurt felt shortchanged by the 50-50 merger and members of each argued that their exchange was worth more. Meanwhile, the decision to split the market between blue chips in London and high-growth stocks in Frankfurt proved equally troublesome. Porsche, the German automobile company, refused to list in London, while many British technology companies said they were uncomfortable listing in Frankfurt and being subject to German regulations, which differ from British guidelines.</p>
        <p>In a survey conducted by Granville Baird, an investment banking group in London, only 17 percent of technology firms supported the iX proposal, while only 5 percent of institutional investors said they were in favor of the plan.</p>
        <p>When the deal was first announced in May, both sides agreed that all stocks listed on the combined exchange, even those traded in London, would be denominated in euros. That angered British traders who thought there was a hidden motive to force Britain into adopting the single European currency, a hot political issue here.</p>
        <p>Another blunder came in the form of an internal memo meant for London Stock Exchange press officers that was inadvertently leaked in May and deeply offended the Germans. It contained instructions on how to field questions from reporters in the event that iX collapsed.</p>
        <p>One suggestion, according to a copy of the memo: ''Knocking copy off the record: Intransigence of Germans over regulation; no shared vision; despite LSE's flexibility and willingness to compromise.''</p>
