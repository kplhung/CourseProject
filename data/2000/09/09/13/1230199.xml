        <p>A thick, smoky electrical fire on a Metro-North train near New Rochelle shut down the railroad's New Haven line for almost an hour at the height of the evening rush yesterday. About 35,000 commuters on the line, Metro-North's busiest, were delayed by an hour or more, said Dan Brucker, a railroad spokesman.</p>
        <p>There were no serious injuries, but a conductor was taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation and a passenger was treated for stress, Mr. Brucker said.</p>
        <p>At 9 p.m., more than two hours after the fire was under control, commuters at Grand Central Terminal were still waiting up to an hour for a train, he said. Service was expected to be back to normal this morning, he said.</p>
        <p>The fire began at 5:15 p.m. in the batteries and wires in the undercarriage of a southbound train just north of New Rochelle, said the New Rochelle fire chief, Raymond Kiernan. The engineer of a passing train noticed the fire and radioed railroad officials, who halted the train and ordered the 200 passengers off, Mr. Brucker said.</p>
        <p>The train was partly in the station, but the back end, where the fire was, was in an underpass tunnel, which quickly filled with smoke from burning insulation and electrical housing, Chief Kiernan said.</p>
        <p>''It was a real black, thick, ugly, plasticky, rubber smoke,'' he said. ''It was not a pleasant smoke, it was rotten smoke. And there was a significant amount of it and a significant amount of flame.''</p>
        <p>Officials shut down all four tracks on the line because they had to turn off the power and because equipment and fire hoses were laid out across the tracks, the chief said. The fire was under control by 6:40 p.m., the chief said. In the meantime, one track had been reopened at 5:55, but trains were only able to crawl through, and the bottleneck kept the line at a near-standstill for a couple of hours, Mr. Brucker said.</p>
        <p>''At one point during the height of this thing, we had 40 trains trying to go north that couldn't go north and 40 trains trying to go south that couldn't go south,'' Mr. Brucker said.</p>
        <p>The 200 southbound passengers on the train that caught fire were delayed up to three hours, Mr. Brucker said; Chief Kiernan said many of them gave up and took cabs to New York City.</p>
        <p>Grand Central Terminal, normally a blur of rushing commuters in the evening, appeared to be in suspended animation as passengers stood frozen in place, cell phones or newspapers out, waiting for the next train to New Haven.</p>
        <p>Steve Martin, 27, a business development consultant, groaned when he heard that the trains had been delayed. ''The only reason I'm frustrated is that this is the first time I've been able to catch the 6:30 train in two or three months,'' he said.</p>
