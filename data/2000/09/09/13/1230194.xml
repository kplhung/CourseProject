        <p>A New York state judge threatened on Monday to hold a lawyer involved in the Holocaust-related reparations lawsuits in criminal contempt for failing to pay court-imposed penalties in a personal injury case.</p>
        <p>The judge, Thomas W. Keegan of State Supreme Court in Albany, said the lawyer, Edward D.

        <p>A New York state judge threatened on Monday to hold a lawyer involved in the Holocaust-related reparations lawsuits in criminal contempt for failing to pay court-imposed penalties in a personal injury case.</p>
        <p>The judge, Thomas W. Keegan of State Supreme Court in Albany, said the lawyer, Edward D. Fagan, had ignored his orders to show that he had paid $12,500 in court-imposed penalties in the case. Judge Keegan had warned Mr. Fagan in May that if he failed to show proof of payment he risked being held in contempt of court, court papers show.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fagan did not respond to a telephone call for comment yesterday. A lawyer who has represented him, Hal R. Lieberman, said he did not have any comment on the matter. Judge Keegan ordered Mr. Fagan to explain his actions at a hearing scheduled for next month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fagan, who has been one of the principal lawyers involved in actions against companies and banks charged with profiting from the Holocaust, was the subject of an article in The New York Times on Friday.</p>
        <p>The article, which chronicled complaints against the lawyer, was prepared under a joint reporting agreement between The Times and ABC News. It was also broadcast Friday on the ABC program ''20/20.''</p>
        <p>The filing of the order by Judge Keegan did not have a connection with the appearance of the article.</p>
        <p>The order involves a lawsuit filed in 1997 by Mr. Fagan on behalf of Christopher Bombardier and his parents against Christian Brothers Academy of Albany, a parochial school. In the action, Mr. Bombardier contended that while a student at the school in 1993 he was assaulted by a classmate and severely injured.</p>
        <p>The judge imposed $5,000 in sanctions in 1998 against Mr. Fagan after finding that the case filed in his court was identical to one brought on Mr. Bombardier's behalf in another New York State court. In August 1999, he ordered Mr. Fagan to pay an additional $7,500 to the defendants in the case to reimburse them for legal costs.</p>
        <p>It is rare, legal experts said, for a lawyer to be held in criminal contempt. If such a finding is made against Mr. Fagan he could face a fine of $1,000 or 30 days in jail or both.</p>
        <p>One legal expert said Mr. Fagan might be able to resolve the matter by paying the court-ordered penalties.</p>
