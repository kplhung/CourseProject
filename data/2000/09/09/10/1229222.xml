        <p>LIKE most 18-year-olds, Heather Lynn had scarcely heard of meningitis when she applied to college last fall. But after being accepted at the University of Massachusetts, she received a letter from the school recommending that she be vaccinated for the disease. And when she discovered that all her college-bound friends in New Rochelle were getting the vaccination, she went to the Sound Shore Medical Center and got one herself.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lynn and her cohorts have the unusual distinction of being the first class to enter college since the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta recommended late last year that college students be educated about the disease, which can be fatal and strikes freshmen living in dormitories at six times the rate of the general population.</p>
        <p>A result, said several Westchester medical practices, has been a vastly increased demand for the vaccine as students prepare to leave home.</p>
        <p>In July and August, the Westchester Medical Group of White Plains administered between 180 and 200 meningitis vaccinations, said Dr. Barbara Coven, one of the group's four practitioners. Last year the figure was 15.</p>
        <p>''My sense is that nobody was coming for it two years ago,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Lederman of the Infectious Diseases and Travel Medicine Division at Sound Shore in New Rochelle. This year, Dr. Lederman has administered about 10 vaccinations, he said.</p>
        <p>Meningitis is caused by meningococcal bacteria and is spread through the air in droplets from coughs and sneezes, or through direct contact -- kissing, for example, or sharing drinking glasses. One of the mysteries of the disease is that many people carry meningococci in their throats without becoming ill.</p>
        <p>No one knows why the disease is so much more common among freshman dorm residents, said Dr. James Turner, the director of student health at the University of Virginia and chairman of the Preventable Diseases Task Force at the American College Health Association.</p>
        <p>But, he said, meningitis appears to have something to do with groups of people from different backgrounds living in close proximity. Meningitis rates were very high in the United States military, particularly in training camps where recruits were housed together until 1971, when the services began performing routine immunizations.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Aventis Pasteur, the only licensed maker of the meningitis vaccine in the United States, said that private- sector sales over the last four months -- the period when college freshmen are most likely to be immunized -- had nearly tripled compared with the same period last year.</p>
        <p>Colleges and universities in Westchester have also made the vaccine available, at the urging of the state Board of Health.</p>
        <p>''We have offered it for the past three years, but we had no takers until TV and newspapers got a hold of it last fall,'' said Karen Lolli, the associate director of the Health Care Units at Pace University in White Plains. So far, the health center has vaccinated only a handful of students, perhaps because many are getting the shot at home, Ms. Lolli said.</p>
        <p>Nationwide, about 470 schools are making the vaccine available, compared with 10 in 1997, Dr. Turner said.</p>
        <p>In addition to the federal agency's recommendations, the demand for vaccines has been fueled by news coverage of meningitis cases and scares. In late August a student at the University of Delaware became seriously ill with the disease. And during the same week 1,000 people who attended a ''rave'' in Michigan and allegedly shared a pacifier dipped in the drug Ecstasy were urged to see a doctor after meningitis was diagnosed in one of them.</p>
        <p>Even among freshman dormitory residents the disease is extremely rare, striking only 3.8 of every 100,000, according to the disease control centers. But it has triggered anxiety and sensational news coverage well beyond its case numbers because of its deadliness and because it is difficult to diagnose.</p>
        <p>Meningitis starts out like a mild flu, with symptoms like fever, sore throat, headache, rash, muscle aches and nausea, but if it is not treated quickly with antibiotics the victim can go into a coma and die within hours. It is fatal in 13 percent of those who catch it, a rate rivaled by few other types of infection. And about 15 percent of those who survive develop permanent brain damage.</p>
        <p>The response by school authorities has varied. Some have pursued immunization aggressively, bringing in private companies to help administer the shots. The University of Virginia, for instance, administered 3,800 meningitis shots over two days in the student union ballroom last November.</p>
        <p>Krystal Poinsette, who grew up in Mount Vernon and will be a senior at the University of Maryland at College Park this year, said her campus was plastered with mailings and posters about the vaccine. ''You can get it on the way to class if you want to,'' she said. Ms. Poinsette got her vaccination last month at the Sound Shore Medical Center.</p>
        <p>But some students have been reluctant to get the vaccine because of the cost, which is about $75 when bought at a campus health center, said Dr. Audrey Sheehy, the director of student health services at Purchase College. At private clinics like Sound Shore, the cost is about $125, Dr. Lederman said. Some insurance companies cover the expense, but many do not. In some cases, because the meningitis shot is a new recommendation,  insurance companies have not had time to integrate it into their compensation package.</p>
        <p>In addition, Dr. Sheehy said, some doctors doubt that mass immunizations are necessary for such a rare disease. There are deadlier diseases that are more common, she said, like hepatitis B, for which there has been no equivalent vaccination campaign.</p>
        <p>It may be the mystery of the disease's transmission, she said, that has resulted in the widespread anxiety and consequent publicity of the past few years.</p>
        <p>''It's interesting because it gets to the heart of what people are afraid of,'' she said. ''It's the same as the West Nile virus. People are much more afraid of things they don't have any control over. It's the things that fall out of heaven on the innocent that really spark our imagination.''</p>
        <p>The vaccine is 85 to 95 percent effective against the four most common bacterial causes of the disease, which comprise about 75 percent of all incidences of the disease in college students, Dr. Turner said. The vaccine lasts between three and five years.</p>
