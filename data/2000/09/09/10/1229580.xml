        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mario Vargas Llosa's review of ''Manuel Puig and the Spider Woman'' is at once gratifying and unfortunate -- gratifying in its appreciation of the thorough effort by its author, Suzanne Jill Levine; unfortunate in its lack of appreciation for the work of Manuel Puig. The reviewer's main complaint is that Puig's work is ''light literature . . . that has no other purpose than to entertain.'' He ties this to Puig's fascination with popular Hollywood films of the 30's and 40's. Vargas Llosa fails to understand two important lessons of the author he criticizes: (1) the depth of film's celluloid surface and (2) the close analogy between the moviegoing experience and the psychoanalytic session. As shown in Levine's biography, Puig's fiction is an intense, sustained exploration of the self and the other, using film and psychoanalytic theory as the preferred means of entry. In this area, critics of Puig's work have only scratched the surface, and Levine's biography provides a wealth of information for future scholars.</p>
