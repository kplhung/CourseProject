        <p>Pete Sampras backpedaled toward the baseline and sprang above the court, levitating for an instant in the rarefied air he alone seems to inhabit. And then Sampras shattered the idyllic moment by blistering the ball, his feet landing about the time his overhead crashed to earth.</p>
        <p>Sampras's stunning and yet so familiar snapshot set up his match point in yesterday's United States Open semifinal against the Australian teenager Lleyton Hewitt.</p>
        <p>With the exception of a few strands of hair, that could have been an image from 10 years ago, when Sampras was the 19-year-old with nothing to lose, unexpectedly capturing the first of his record 13 Grand Slam singles titles.</p>
        <p>Now, Sampras expects nothing less. Like a career highlight film on the court at Arthur Ashe Stadium yesterday, he smashed overheads, cranked timely aces and rifled service returns that frustrated the anxious prodigy on the other side of the net. After speeding to a two-set lead, Sampras shrugged off a 1-4 deficit in the third set for a 7-6 (7), 6-4, 7-6 (5) triumph that sent him soaring into today's final, trying to capture his fifth United States Open title.</p>
        <p>''Ten years I've been through a lot of wars out there, a lot of battles, I've won a lot of big matches,'' Sampras said. ''I've done a lot more in the game I ever thought I would. When I won here at 19, I just played a couple great matches and the next thing I knew, I won the Open. I didn't know where my tennis was going to go from that point.</p>
        <p>''It just evolved into something,'' he added with a pause, ''you know, pretty special.''</p>
        <p>This afternoon, Sampras will face another hungry youngster. In yesterday's first men's semifinal, the 20-year-old Russian Marat Safin dismantled an already broken-down Todd Martin, overcoming mental lapses with his imposing physical tools and boundless energy to reach his first Grand Slam final with a 6-3, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (1) victory.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I will have a chance,'' Safin said about today's matchup. ''If I don't have a chance, what can I do? It's Pete, you know, 13 Grand Slams he won. He's No. 1 in the world. If not, what can I do? Final's O.K.''</p>
        <p>But that is not satisfactory to Sampras, who has won 13 of 15 the Grand Slam finals he has played. ''When you have raised the bar winning Grand Slams each year, you expect it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Last year, Sampras could not compete at the United States Open, sustaining a herniated disk in practice a day before the tournament began.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Sampras marched into the stadium healthy, happy and confident, and even though he had yet to win in the four-year-old stadium, he showed that he reigns on the court. President Clinton was the first sitting president to attend a match at Flushing Meadows, and while he was busy signing fans' hats from the United States Tennis Association's president's box, Clinton's presence did not rattle Sampras.</p>
        <p>''Well, it's my court, you know,'' he said. ''That's where I'm comfortable. I wouldn't want to give a speech to him.''</p>
        <p>Instead, Sampras offered a 2-hour-36-minute state of the game address. Hewitt, for his peskiness and 23 aces, is not ready to take Sampras's mantle. ''I'm still able to hold my own,'' Sampras said with a smile.</p>
        <p>In the first-set tie breaker, Sampras climbed out of a hole by constructing the right shots at the right time but also surviving by some luck. Hewitt had two set points, but on the second one, he salivated on a short ball from Sampras. Hewitt saw the open court in front of him, and drew his racket back so far behind him in anticipation that when he finally unloaded, he whipped it wide. Sampras hit an inside-out forehand winner and then a service winner on a 120-mile-an-hour serve to take the first set.</p>
        <p>''You've worked so hard for that set,'' Hewitt said. ''To be set point up and make an easy error, obviously you feel frustrated right away.''</p>
        <p>Sampras said: ''I was pretty lucky to get out of it. My confidence grew, my serving picked up a bit. Just a huge part of the match.''</p>
        <p>But Hewitt would not go away quietly. He broke Sampras's serve in the second game of the third set, shouting, ''Come on!'' and then took a 3-0 lead. With Hewitt ahead, 4-2, and serving, Sampras hammered two straight service return winners.</p>
        <p>Then, on his second break point, he forced Hewitt to crank a backhand wide, and Hewitt slammed his racket down in disgust. The two stayed on serve to tie the score at 5-5. Hewitt won the next game and then Sampras called for the trainer, Doug Spreen, to apply some hot cream on a tightened left groin muscle.</p>
        <p>Sampras would finish soon. Despite falling behind, 4-5, in the tie breaker, he won three straight points, starting with a deep volley winner in the corner. When Hewitt sent a lob into the wind, Sampras decided at the last minute to hit it, flying for the overhead winner. On match point, Sampras hit a crosscourt backhand for which Hewitt had no response.</p>
        <p>''This was the best I've ever seen him play against me,'' Hewitt said.</p>
        <p>Just as Sampras lost to Hewitt this summer on grass and picked up his game when he needed to yesterday, he will have to do the same against Safin. In August, Safin upended Sampras along the way to winning the Canadian Open, a hardcourt tournament.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the sixth-seeded Safin won his 51st match of the year, showing no mercy on Martin. Martin has been held together by Ace bandages, heating pads and sticky will in an effort to reach the final for the second straight year. After his fourth-round, four-hour epic survival, it was only a matter of time before his body failed him.</p>
        <p>''I was fighting an uphill battle the whole way,'' Martin said. ''Even when I was up a set point in the second set, he was still so on his game, it was tough to handle. I will look back on this tournament and think I got my money's worth. It's like renting a car. The new plan is, 'Do you want to return it empty?' I'm going to the airport empty.''</p>
        <p>Safin was the reason, overwhelming Martin with 58 winners and just 26 unforced errors. Safin did not let his emotions control him. He threw his racket twice to the court in disgust, but recovered as if it never happened. ''I thought I was playing horrible today,'' he said. ''Because I started, completely out of the court, I couldn't find my concentration.''</p>
        <p>Martin disputed that. ''Despite being extremely upset, he's like, 'O.K., next point,' '' Martin said. ''I was trying to capitalize on those periods of time when he was upset.''</p>
        <p>Safin induced Martin to the net and either lofted perfect lobs or passed him. ''I had to attack, in order not to get smothered,'' Martin said. ''I think I played pretty well, but it seemed as though he was laughing at me.''</p>
        <p>Safin broke Martin's serve at love in the fifth game of the second set, and it seemed just a matter of time until Martin would wane. He was down, 2-4, in the second set and could not author another two-sets-down comeback.</p>
        <p>Safin heads into the final with confidence.</p>
        <p>''You know, he believes he can beat me, so that's a big bonus for him,'' Sampras said about Safin, whom he has defeated twice. ''It is a final of a major. He hasn't played many of them. He's going to come out not intimidated by the situation. At 29, I feel like I've got a lot of good years left in me to really contend for major tournaments. That's what drives me.''</p>
