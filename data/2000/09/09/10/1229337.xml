        <p>IN September, the sunlit garden blazes with strong colors: dark red dahlias, deep plum-colored gladioli, brilliant yellow rudbeckias towering over orange canna flowers. But the real star of autumn doesn't start shining until dusk, when the nicotianas pick up their drooping heads, open their white throats and pour perfume into the darkening air.</p>
        <p>Nicotiana alata, also known as N. affinis, gives no hint of splendor during the day. The plants are rangy and tall, the half-closed flowers a washed-out chartreuse, lightly veined in pale maroon. Stems and leaves are covered with small, sticky hairs, guaranteeing that by summer's end the plant will look as if it needs dusting. (It does, but you can't: nothing but a real downpour really cleans it off.)</p>

        <p>IN September, the sunlit garden blazes with strong colors: dark red dahlias, deep plum-colored gladioli, brilliant yellow rudbeckias towering over orange canna flowers. But the real star of autumn doesn't start shining until dusk, when the nicotianas pick up their drooping heads, open their white throats and pour perfume into the darkening air.</p>
        <p>Nicotiana alata, also known as N. affinis, gives no hint of splendor during the day. The plants are rangy and tall, the half-closed flowers a washed-out chartreuse, lightly veined in pale maroon. Stems and leaves are covered with small, sticky hairs, guaranteeing that by summer's end the plant will look as if it needs dusting. (It does, but you can't: nothing but a real downpour really cleans it off.)</p>
        <p>When night falls, however, the flowers glow. Leaves and stems fade into darkness. You know why N. alata used to be called jasmine tobacco, and all its faults fall away.</p>
        <p>In fact, the virtues list is a long one, including far more than scent.</p>
        <p>Those hairs keep predators away, and as long as the plants aren't overfed, they seldom become diseased. They thrive in full sun or light shade, tolerate both drought and sog, and grow in almost any soil but tightly packed clay.</p>
        <p>They are powerhouse flower-producers, too. Keep them deadheaded, cut them back when they get leggy and they will keep producing until killed by hard frost.</p>
        <p>Each flower makes buckets of seeds, which self-sow readily. As long as you remember not to deadhead everything, one planting will provide a lifetime supply of volunteers.</p>
        <p>The tiny, gray-green seedlings don't appear until well after the weather has warmed, but once they do show up, they're patient. You can move them to new spots whenever you get around to it, even when they are quite large, a trait that comes in handy as earlier annuals fade away.</p>
        <p>Each year, for instance, the 30-foot swath of shirley poppies that borders our central path gives up the ghost in late July. No problem. I just shop around where I haven't weeded and before long have a 30-foot swath of undernourished nicotianas. (Life is tough under a squash plant.) With sunlight and a dose of fertilizer, fill-out is swift. Two or three weeks later, we have a full sweep of night fragrance that lasts well into fall.</p>
        <p>Nicotiana alata is a tender perennial, usually sold as an annual because it's killed by strong frost. Gardeners in Zones 8 and warmer can keep it going simply by cutting it back. (Cover with a dry mulch if your climate is borderline.)</p>
        <p>You can also dig it up and put it in a pot. It will continue to flower in a sunny window until Thanksgiving or so. Cut it back when it quits and let it rest through the winter (no fertilizer). Feed it in spring and it will start blossoming again.</p>
        <p>In addition to alata, there are about 70 other species of nicotiana. Most are more or less scentless, but the statuesque N. sylvestris is a happy exception. Though far larger than alata, it has a more delicate scent, less heavily tropical, with shadings of rose and lilac.</p>
        <p>Given room to grow, N. sylvestris makes a yard-wide rosette of enormous leaves while sending up six-foot blooming stems, and its starry clusters of narrow flowers erupt from their stalks like fireworks. On the downside, the lower leaves start to look ratty well before blooming ends. Clearly a case for Dr. Alata: transplant a few into sylvestris's skirts and the new growth will hide bare spots while giving another layer to the fragrance.</p>
        <p>N. sylvestris is sometimes marketed as Only the Lonely, a reminder that the whole group has severe nomenclature problems. Other old-fashioned flowers have poetic common names: cupid's dart for Cata nanche, love-in-a-mist for Nigella, dame's violet for Hesperis. But nicotianas can't seem to do any better than flowering tobacco.</p>
        <p>Perhaps there's some justice involved. The flowering types do contain nicotine, and Nicotiana glauca, or tree tobacco, a perennial type with smooth, blue-green leaves and scentless but charming small yellow flowers, is so toxic that eating even a little will kill you.</p>
        <p>This doesn't keep me from cherishing my N. glauca plant, which has been going back and forth between basement and garden for eight years. I just dig it up in the fall, whack it back so it will fit under the beams and put the roots in a plastic bag. The following spring, outside it goes. By fall it will be a 10-foot tree festooned with narrow yellow bells.</p>
        <p>The nicotianas' rightful colors are yellow, white and, in N. langsdorffii and N. Lime Green, a lovely though not particularly limey green. To get reds and pinks you must plant one of the modern hybrids, ideally either Daylight Sensation or Heaven Scent. Though their colors are somewhat muddy, they still have strong fragrance and blend well with other plants. That's more than can be said for the Domino group, and much more than can be said for the ubiquitous Nicki series.</p>
        <p>Squat, sticky, dull-colored, open all day, the utterly scentless Nickis threw out the baby and kept the bath water, but because they bloom while still very small, they are the only nicotiana plants sold in most garden centers. If they're the only nicotianas you know, a world of wonders awaits.</p>
