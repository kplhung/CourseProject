        <p>Who Are We?</p>
        <p>Critical Reflections and Hopeful Possibilities.</p>
        <p>By Jean Bethke Elshtain.</p>
        <p>178 pp. Grand Rapids, Mich.:</p>
        <p>William+B.+Eerdmans Publishing Company. $20.</p>
        <p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer and John Paul II are her ''primary interlocutors.'' Pride and Sloth are the categories in which she arranges the flaws of contemporary culture. She speaks from a Lutheran tradition now effecting a rapprochement with the older church from which it has been divided. For this Christian moralist, sin distorts individual and communal lives, hope is a necessary virtue, and God is not an icon or a mirage but a presence.</p>
        <p>Jean Bethke Elshtain is the Rockefeller professor of social and political ethics at the University of Chicago. Unsurprisingly -- to use one of her favored adverbs -- she has found her academic home not in the departments of sociology or political science but in the school of divinity. At Chicago, where the methodologies of economics have threatened to swallow other approaches to life, theologians are still hospitable to human concerns not expressible in cash.</p>
        <p>Commodification! It appears, as Elshtain observes in ''Who Are We?,'' to be a visible destroyer of values that should not be for sale or measured in monetary terms. She cites the advertisements that have run in college newspapers throughout the country offering $25,000, $50,000, (and now) $100,000 for the ova of young women with high admission scores, athletic ability and, in some instances, blue eyes and blond hair. Stanford, to take a campus I know, has not forbidden such advertising; after all, a woman could pay much of her college tuition in this way. What is bought and sold, however, is closely linked with personal identity, with motherhood, with interpersonal love. Unsurprisingly in this culture, a television show gains millions of viewers and is reported on the front page of The New York Times when the show presents 50 women wanting to marry a man of whom they know nothing except that his assets presumably exceeded $1,999,999. To extend Elshtain's argument, what Sloth to seek a lifelong partnership this way.</p>
        <p>In plenty of cultures, to be sure, and in many times and places, men and women have married for money or used money to win a partner in procreation. The critic of our commodifying culture is not identifying an unknown vice but a new openness, a new thoroughgoingness, a new hardness in bartering what should not be sold. The old moralists denounced the sin of simony as the attempt to buy or sell the Holy Spirit; they extended the sin to the sale of justice, another value they thought could not be commodified. No one -- not even the most ruthless of economists -- has suggested that we auction justice. Is it any better that we auction human ova or human love?</p>
        <p>As we move into a world of new technologies, the cloning of human beings has become a possibility. Warning voices have been raised; Elshtain endorses the arguments of the bioethicist Leon Kass against even embarking on this course. Certainly the strongest argument is that in the present culture, clones would be commodified. A competitive market in the production and sale of clones -- varieties designed and sold for a variety of purposes -- poses a future in which slavery would return in subtler guise.</p>
        <p>Feminists have protested the obscene television display of the women willing to marry for $2 million. Left and liberal critics have lamented the push of the market into every sphere from education to prisons. Wittily critiquing commodification, Elshtain will receive a sympathetic hearing. On other aspects of the dominant culture, like abortion and assisted suicide, she will encounter resistance. Believers are divided as to the moral acceptability of such practices. Elshtain, however, argues that the acceptance of these forms of human-inflicted death relates to a sense of human autonomy that accords no rights to God. Here's where Pride takes its lumps. Outside traditional religions, the very notions that a human being has been created by God, has a destiny beyond this life that is directed to God and has responsibilities to God are atrophied, neglected, unknown or disbelieved. Belief in the theistic propositions does no more than open the mind to the possibility of limits to human freedom. Without them, the views thoughtfully espoused by Elshtain will not make sense to many. On other subjects, notably contraception and celibacy, where believers are even more divided among themselves, Elshtain is prudently silent.</p>
        <p>Many believers and unbelievers come together again on capital punishment -- believers because they have come to see it as another human invasion of the Creator's power, unbelievers because they see it as an irredeemable extinction of life. So limited in practice as to be of little more than symbolic significance (except for those executed), the death penalty is another feature of our culture scrutinized with critical concern by Elshtain.</p>
        <p>I find it difficult to say that one culture, globally considered, is worse than another. We don't have the tools to make the measurement. Until well into the 19th century, human slavery was legally and morally accepted in substantial parts of the world. Up until the middle of this century, racism was legally and morally accepted in this country and in many parts of the world. Discrimination determined by gender is only now being dismantled. Every culture to the moralist is distinguished not only by Pride and Sloth but by the five other deadly sins, Anger, Avarice, Envy, Gluttony and Lust; and the deadly sins don't exhaust the possibilities of going wrong. What distinguishes a culture is the particular forms the vices take.</p>
        <p>Sounding at the end the note of hope, Elshtain finds it running like a submerged stream in some modern films, including ''Titanic,'' and some modern literature, like the poetry and prose of Czeslaw Milosz, a survivor of Nazi occupation and Communist domination. In his celebration of human living, Elshtain, a devoted grandmother, sees ''the fragility and miracle of the quotidian.'' The title of the book asks a question, to which the book implicitly responds. We are those who make this culture of atheism and faith, cash bottom lines and virtues beyond price, cynicism and aspiration.</p>
