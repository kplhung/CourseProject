        <p>Great bars come in every possible guise. There are great pickup bars, great bars for retro cocktails and even great dives, when you're in the Charles Bukowski frame of mind. My favorite genre is the sumptuous hotel bar, and my favorite New York hotel bar is Mark's Bar, at the Mark Hotel on East 77th Street.</p>
        <p>It is a tiny little thing. It cannot match the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis for eye-popping display, or the Oak Room Bar at the Plaza for pedigree. But it suits me perfectly, a relatively undiscovered pleasure spot tucked away off to the side of the hotel lobby.</p>

        <p>Great bars come in every possible guise. There are great pickup bars, great bars for retro cocktails and even great dives, when you're in the Charles Bukowski frame of mind. My favorite genre is the sumptuous hotel bar, and my favorite New York hotel bar is Mark's Bar, at the Mark Hotel on East 77th Street.</p>
        <p>It is a tiny little thing. It cannot match the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis for eye-popping display, or the Oak Room Bar at the Plaza for pedigree. But it suits me perfectly, a relatively undiscovered pleasure spot tucked away off to the side of the hotel lobby.</p>
        <p>The bar itself is barely five feet long, but a bartender in black tie somehow manages to ply his trade, mixing the great classics and stirring up a few new ones, like a nifty negroni made with Punt e Mes, an Italianized Manhattan made with Carpano Antica and a bright young thing called the Big Apple, made with vodka, Calvados and lemon juice.</p>
        <p>I like bars with hidden corners. Mark's Bar, a solid, clubby-looking room with dark green walls and black wood trim, seems to be nothing but hidden corners.</p>
        <p>When the world outside clamors, it's strongly tempt-ing to slink into this chamber of repose and settle into one of the love seats, upholstered in green velvet, or sit on one of the low-slung, pouffy chairs and peruse a list of a dozen ports, nearly a dozen specialty bourbons, 10 wines by the glass and the very nice de Venoge champagne, which is well priced at $14 a glass.</p>
        <p>If the stars align properly, you might have the place to yourself. It's like renting a million-dollar apartment for the price of a couple of movie tickets. Next to getting a massage with $100 bills, I can't think of a more luxurious, soothing sensation.</p>
