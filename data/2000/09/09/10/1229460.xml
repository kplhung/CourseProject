        <p>The Jets will probably use the younger, more mobile Ray Lucas in place of Vinny Testaverde to confuse the New England Patriots at times on Monday night, but they may need more than occasional confusion. The Jets learned today that their top receiver, Wayne Chrebet, is injured, joining running back Curtis Martin in the trainer's room.</p>
        <p>''Put yourself in the defense's spot,'' Lucas said today, savoring the possibility of replacing Testaverde. ''They don't know when I'm coming in, and then they have to prepare for Vinny, a legend in his own right.''</p>

        <p>The Jets will probably use the younger, more mobile Ray Lucas in place of Vinny Testaverde to confuse the New England Patriots at times on Monday night, but they may need more than occasional confusion. The Jets learned today that their top receiver, Wayne Chrebet, is injured, joining running back Curtis Martin in the trainer's room.</p>
        <p>''Put yourself in the defense's spot,'' Lucas said today, savoring the possibility of replacing Testaverde. ''They don't know when I'm coming in, and then they have to prepare for Vinny, a legend in his own right.''</p>
        <p>But the Patriots may not have to prepare for Chrebet. Toward the end of today's practice, Chrebet went up for a Testaverde pass, landed awkwardly and injured his knee. The Jets immediately listed him as 50-50, or questionable, to play Monday night. There were no further details.</p>
        <p>Thus, the wide receivers will be Dedric Ward, who has started five games as a Jet; Vincent Brisby, a recent free-agent pickup from New England; and the rookies Windrell Hayes and Laveranues Coles.</p>
        <p>That problem adds to another potentially serious one: Coach Al Groh disclosed that Martin's sprained knee will not allow the Jets to use him as often as they did in the season-opening victory at Green Bay. Thus, the Jets are looking for something to take the pressure off Testaverde and the rest of the offense in goal-line or third-down situations.</p>
        <p>''There are things we can't do next week, but he'll be able to play,'' Groh said of Martin's availability. Martin will probably wear a brace on his left knee; Jerald Sowell and Richie Anderson are ready as backups.</p>
        <p>Enter Lucas. All week he had emulated the Patriots' Michael Bishop, the young quarterback who can run option plays and who has more speed than Drew Bledsoe. Bishop might replace Bledsoe when the Patriots get near the goal line. He did it in a preseason game, the Pats scored, and that gave Groh an idea.</p>
        <p>''What caught my attention was that Bishop had run the option for a touchdown, and I thought, 'Hmm, we've got one of those kinds of guys ourselves,' '' Groh said.</p>
        <p>Groh not only employed Lucas this week to emulate Bishop, he even used Lucas as part of the Jets' offensive game plan.</p>
        <p>Groh described the Lucas option as intriguing. Still, he said: ''I don't know if it's intriguing to the offensive coaches. I'm looking at it as a defensive guy.''</p>
        <p>Bishop saw action for only one play in a loss to Tampa Bay last Sunday. He was brought in for a 2-point conversion, but was stopped.</p>
        <p>Of course, it is possible that Lucas will not even get into the game or that Martin will not play much. Martin said he expected the Patriots' coach, Bill Belichick, ''to throw everything but the kitchen sink at me.''</p>
        <p>But the Jets are hoping the threat that Martin and Lucas can play will affect New England's defense -- like a police car parked on the side of the road. That could be enough to make the Patriots' defense slow down.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Who has been better off since the feud between the Jets and Patriots began with the defection of BILL PARCELLS and most of his staff to the Jets in 1997? In the three seasons under Parcells and AL GROH, the Jets are 30-19. New England is 27-22 under PETE CARROLL and BILL BELICHICK. In face-to-face encounters, the Jets are 4-2. And those famous exchanges of draft picks the Jets yielded to New England to bring Parcells and CURTIS MARTIN to New York? Of those six picks, only one is a starter for the Pats, linebacker ANDY KATZENMOYER. Three others are out of football. . . . DREW BLEDSOE, sacked six times and knocked down frequently against Tampa Bay, has had problems since Parcells left. Since then -- with Belichick as the Jets' defensive coordinator and Groh as their linebackers coach -- Bledsoe was the winning quarterback in only two of five starts against them. His teams scored 20 or more points twice.</p>
