        <p>WITH automation, the World Wars, the Great Depression and the rise of plastics, the 20th century was almost the worst of times for glassmaking. However, over the past few decades, glass has enjoyed a renaissance. Now it seems like the best of times. Gay LeCleire Taylor, the curator of the Museum of American Glass at Wheaton Village here, has organized an exhibit surveying American glass since 1900</p>
        <p>The exhibit illustrates the most significant developments that have affected glass during the 20th century. Ms. Taylor stated that over the past 100 years glassmaking ''has undergone dramatic changes in style and production methods.'' This thoughtful tribute to American ingenuity and creativity weaves together technology, aesthetics and economics.</p>
        <p>Star treatment is awarded to a ''Blue Daffodil'' leaded glass and bronze table lamp made around 1900 by Tiffany Studios and a ''Venetian Series'' vase, which was designed by Dale Chihuly and made by Lino Tagliapietra at Wheaton Village in 1991.  Louis Comfort Tiffany and Mr. Chihuly are, indeed, the most recognized names in American glass.</p>
        <p>Since Tiffany opens the 20th century and Mr. Chihuly closes it, these pieces are the exhibition's benchmarks, each presented in its own free-standing showcase. The other pieces are arranged chronologically by decades.</p>
        <p>In spite of the years that separate Tiffany and Mr. Chihuly, they make an interesting and complementary pair. Both artists have been inspired directly by nature. Tiffany was a designer, not a glassblower. Assistants executed his decorative concepts. Since a car accident in the 1970's, Mr. Chihuly no longer blows glass; he directs others to bring his expressive drawings to fruition.</p>
        <p>When Michael Owens invented the bottle-blowing machine in 1903, it was a critical turning point for the glass industry, especially in South Jersey. The machine could make 16 bottles per minute. This eliminated the need for skilled glassblowers and the opportunity for workers to make end-of-workday decorative glass as a personal diversion. The industry went into a slump.</p>
        <p>But then Pyrex was patented on May 27, 1919. This heat-resistant glass dramatically changed the way Americans cooked. One of the earliest dishes made of Pyrex by the Corning Glass Company is displayed.  An iron with a Pyrex body that dates from the early 1940's looks like a handsome ice sculpture. Offered for sale in a choice of three shades, this red iron was the most popular. Ms. Taylor admitted that she could not resist plugging it in to see if it heated up. It did.</p>
        <p>During the 1930's and 40's, the glass industry continued to struggle, but some manufacturers used innovative modernist designs to attract consumers. The decanter from the Ruba Rombic line, which was designed by Reuben Haley, epitomizes the spirit of Art Deco. This faceted and angular yellow (marketed as ''sunshine'') glass bottle with its elaborate stopper looks like something from a Cubist still life. Representing a different modernist aesthetic, the ivory-colored cremation urn is fashioned from Carrara Glass, which was developed as a building material. Its stark geometry, smooth surface and lack of ornamentation suggest a strong Bauhaus influence.  These memorial urns were advertised as ''everlastingly beautiful.''</p>
        <p>Studio glass artists began to emerge in the late 50's and early 60's. Frances and Michael Higgins created stylish accessories, like the ''Barbaric Jewels Ashtray.'' It is easy to imagine this object sitting on an amoeba-shaped coffee table in a living room with pleated, fiberglass drapes. Harvey Littleton, a former ceramist, helped to inaugurate the studio glass movement with the creation of his expressionist-likevases that could be made in the newly engineered furnaces fit in an artist's studio.</p>
        <p>By the early 1970's, a few pioneering dealers, like Sally Hansen, Ferdinand Hampson and Douglas Heller, began to sell contemporary art glass to an emergent group of collectors, affirming that glass had become an artist's medium.</p>
        <p>At the same time, glass entered the museum world. The first public institution dedicated to glass is the Corning Museum of Glass, established in 1951. The museum houses the world's most comprehensive collection of glass objects, dating back to ancient Egypt. In 1973, the Museum of American Glass at Wheaton Village was founded. With approximately 12,000 works of industrial and studio art glass, it is the largest museum devoted to American glass in the country.</p>
        <p>One of the most recent objects on display is the ''Millennium Champagne Flute,'' a production piece made by Durand International in Millville. With its molded stem that is a vertical arrangement of ''2000,'' this commemorative item became an immediate commercial success and brought a flurry of manufacturing activity back to the sputtering local glass industry.</p>
        <p>There have certainly been major changes in the world of glass since 1904, when Carl Sandburg wrote:  ''Down in southern New Jersey, they make glass. By day and by night, the fires burn on in Millville.'' This exhibition demonstrates that ''glass continues to enrich and enhance our everyday lives.''</p>
