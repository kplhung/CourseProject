        <p>Three New York real estate companies will open a 45,000-square-foot building on the west side of Manhattan this week that is aimed at attracting high-tech companies interested in short-term commitments as tenants. The gutted and rebuilt six-story building, at 535 West 34th Street, between 10th and 11th Avenues, will offer 59 furnished office suites and will have available high-speed dedicated Internet services, conference rooms with video conferencing and on-site technical support.</p>
        <p>KickStart, as the new company is known, said that tenants would be able to move into offices with multiple phone lines and high-speed DSL Internet service, for as little as three months. Rents start at $1,800 a month.  The building's main floor is reserved for service providers specializing in Web design, accounting, public relations, human resources staffing and real estate.</p>
