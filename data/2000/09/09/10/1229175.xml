        <p>FROM paying lawyers to hiring expert witnesses to appraising a home or business, divorce can be expensive anywhere. But it can be even more costly in an affluent suburb like Westchester County.</p>
        <p>''I think it is an extraordinarily difficult problem,'' Audrey E. Stone, director of the Pace Women's Justice Center in White Plains, said of the fiscal burden of divorce. ''It is particularly extreme here in Westchester because of the high cost of living.''</p>
        <p>If a case is contested, the legal bills can easily reach $10,000, experts say.</p>
        <p>''The more you fight, the more you are going to pay,'' said Martin T. Johnson, chairman of the Family Law Section of the New York State Bar Association.</p>
        <p>Unlike the movies -- or most other states -- there is no such thing as irreconcilable differences in New York. Instead, divorce here requires fault or grounds: adultery; cruel and inhuman treatment; abandonment (either physical or sexual); or a yearlong separation after an agreement is struck.</p>
        <p>But there is a back-door method people often use to speed up the process: after reaching a separation agreement, the couple can come to a consensus on the grounds for divorce, with one party accepting blame -- usually for sexual abandonment.  Such cases are granted with less scrutiny than contested cases, and they can be resolved far more quickly.</p>
        <p>Some call the grounds too strict, even archaic. Others say that even these grounds too easily allow people to dissolve their unions. But either way, the requirement to prove grounds for divorce can contribute to the costs.</p>
        <p>Usually, the first step for divorcing couples is to hire a lawyer. Or two. In contested cases, a retainer for a lawyer experienced in matrimonial law is between $7,500 and $15,000 in Westchester, Mr. Johnson said. Many people said they paid less than that in cases that were not contentious.</p>
        <p>''Probably, the highest-priced divorces are in New York County,'' said Richard V. Danzig, a matrimonial lawyer with the White Plains firm Kurzman &amp; Eisenberg. ''But Westchester is a close second.''</p>
        <p>Once one party has decided to divorce, he or she files a summons and a complaint in court, an opening shot that costs $170. If a case heads toward trial, a request for judicial intervention is filed, for $75, with the county clerk.</p>
        <p>Anger or bitterness can ratchet up the legal fees, especially when people try to exact vengeance through the courts. One spouse may have earned his cash off the books, another may have hidden her savings in an overseas account. All of it is fodder for private investigators.</p>
        <p>Depending on the complexity of the case, accountants or appraisers can be called in to set a value on business interests or a professional degree like a medical license or an M.B.A. Pensions, stock options, deferred compensation plans or profit-sharing benefits are also valued.</p>
        <p>''That is a big Westchester issue,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''We are a county of many, many, many professional people in all walks of life.''</p>
        <p>Costs are also driven up by a state law known as equitable distribution whereby judges try to divide assets fairly, rather than equally. Fees of $10,000 to $50,000 can be incurred for evaluation and distribution of marital property, Mr. Danzig said.</p>
        <p>Establishing maintenance -- or alimony -- requires proof, too. And court-ordered psychological evaluations of the parents and children can be ordered, particularly in custody cases. Those fees can be $2,500 a day for testimony, lawyers said. Costs for a law guardian, a lawyer who represents the interests of the child, can range from $5,000 to $20,000, Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>The Pace Women's Justice Center offers free legal seminars for people who need help going through divorce, Ms. Stone said.</p>
        <p>''There are thousands of working poor, and they can't frequently access the same legal help as nonworking poor,'' said Vicki L. Lutz, executive director of the center, who said families earning $30,000 to $50,000 a year are now being considered for legal assistance. ''We have women who come who have no access to bus fare but live in nice middle-class homes. But the funds are tied up or unavailable to them.''</p>
        <p>Once all the legal issues are understood by the husband and wife, then the parties may be able to reduce their costs.</p>
        <p>''Some realistic expectation as to what you hope to get out of either litigation or settling would, in large measure, govern the sort of costs that a client would be expected to pay,'' Mr. Johnson said.</p>
