        <p>At the end of a rainy season that cut sharply into their profits, amusement park operators say it was not just the weather but the State Division of Community Affairs that bogged down their industry.</p>
        <p>For the past three years, the state's rides have been overseen by William Connolly, head of the Division of Standards and Practices in the Community Affairs office.</p>
        <p>He claims success in his approach to decreasing the number of injuries on rides, which has been to hold operators accountable for safety by demanding they meet rigorous new documentation standards.</p>
        <p>''The year before I took over, there were 24 serious injuries on rides in New Jersey,'' Mr. Connolly said. ''Serious, meaning the rider had either a broken bone or required hospitalization. At the end of my first year the number dropped to 15. The following year it was 12 and this year there has been only one serious injury. What more do I need to say?''</p>
        <p>But Bob Bennett, an owner of the Casino Pier in Wildwood , said: ''That's a no-win kind of statement Mr. Connolly likes to make. If there are no injuries, which we really think is the luck of the draw, he takes credit. If there is a tragedy, he says, 'See how much you need me around?' No win.''</p>
        <p>The state updated its Carnival-Amusement Ride Safety Act in April 1998, the same time it switched control of amusement rides from the state's Department of Labor to the Division of Codes and Standards. The new law increased fines for safety violations to $5,000 from $500, toughened reporting requirements, called for more warning signs and gates for rides, and added a ''rider responsibility'' clause that allowed operators to post warnings that unruly customers could be removed from rides and even charged with disorderly behavior. During the off-season, the state subjects some rides to X-rays and ultrasound tests to detect weaknesses that are not visible.</p>
        <p>Operators say Mr. Connolly has done little more than create a morass of paperwork and his department is too short-staffed to keep up with the inspections and processing that must be done.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennett, who is a director of the New Jersey Amusement Association, a group of amusement park owners and operators, says 51 of the largest of the state's 1,700 rides did not open this season because of clerical delays.</p>
        <p>Members of the amusement association  are also worried that legislation introduced in June by Assemblyman George Geist of Camden County that would hold manufacturers responsible for ride failure may keep some companies from selling to the state.</p>
        <p>The group says the new rules would mean that New Jersey riders might not have access to the newest and most exciting rides because manufacturers would rather go elsewhere than deal with the paperwork.</p>
        <p>Steve Ohlms, former owner of Hampton Amusement Rides, now a consultant for the company in Portage DeSioux, Mo., says New Jersey will remain a valued customer.</p>
        <p>''A sale's a sale,'' Mr. Ohlms said. ''It's just more paperwork. If it costs us more to get that done then we will certainly pass that cost on to the operators who buy from us. But new regulations to keep rides safe will not be a deterrent to sales for us. We sell safe rides.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bennett says the association is calling for revisions in the bill, which it says ''just adds another layer to the process that is already burying the industry in paperwork.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Connolly does not make any apologies for his system or the Assembly bill.</p>
        <p>''Hey, safety comes first,'' Mr. Connolly said. ''Maybe operators are not ready for this brave new world of science and responsibility. This isn't a seat-of-your-pants industry anymore.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''If some manufacturer doesn't want to sell here because we're demanding the rides be safe then I don't think that's a very good argument against the bill or the process.</p>
        <p>''These people work for three months and have nine months to sit around and get their paperwork in order for the 30-day approval process,'' he said. ''They get things in in the 11th hour and expect it to be processed in the 12th. That's just not fair to us.''</p>
        <p>It is that sort of comment that has park owners frustrated. They say that they are safety conscious, but are concerned that the new regulatory timetables and practices are making their businesses increasingly difficult to run.</p>
        <p>''I think that's a completely inappropriate statement from Mr. Connolly,'' said William Morey, owner of Morey's Pier in Wildwood. ''These kinds of things really fire us up. The problem is that operators submit the requested paperwork 30 days in advance and they change the rules. They keep coming back asking for new things and the 30-day process starts again from zero. It's like a bad board game.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Morey is also speaking as an operator whose biggest ride, the Storm, was shut down last September when a child suffered a severe contusion and what was thought to be a buckle fracture to her arm. Analysis of an X-ray taken two weeks later showed no fracture.</p>
        <p>The ride was closed pending investigation. Standards and Practices demanded that the ride's G-forces be tested again and that several documents concerning tests on the ride be produced. Mr. Morey says he complied, but was told that what he supplied was insufficient.</p>
        <p>Nearly a year later the ride is still closed, despite an appeal to the State Office of Administrative Law, which ruled last week that Mr. Connolly had overstepped his authority in demanding the new testing.</p>
        <p>''We're considering suing the state since we've lost close to $650,000 this season by not having the ride open,'' Mr. Morey said. ''The problem is that the rules keep changing and there's really no one to turn to for justice or due process.''</p>
        <p>Of the ride in question, Mr. Connolly said: ''Mr. Morey's in denial. That ride broke a girl's arm and he refused to give me testing that I knew could be done. What he did supply was not scientific enough.''</p>
        <p>To that, Mr. Morey added, ''The problem with this ride was not a massive design  failure, but a single incident that happened after 40,000 riders had safely used the ride. They overreacted.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Morey is not the only operator stymied by the system.</p>
        <p>Barbara Steele, director of the Ocean County Public Affairs Department and the county's Tourism Advisory Council, said of the state's new procedures, ''It's like that Chinese proverb about using an ax to remove a fly from a friend's head.'' She declined further comment.</p>
        <p>Bill Erwin, a member of the Carnival and Amusement Ride Advisory Board for the state who owns Casino Pier with Mr. Bennett, said: ''Right now I'm trying to finish up the season that never started because of the worst weather I've seen on the boardwalk in 40 years. Then there's the paperwork to come. Believe me, if paperwork is the answer to safety issues then New Jersey is the safest in the world.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to criticize Mr. Connolly because I have to sit across a desk from him and being adversarial never helped any situation,'' Mr. Erwin said. ''I know he's forged ahead rapidly. I also think that to accomplish the goals Mr. Connolly has set he's definitely understaffed.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bennett said that on the whole, park operators were dissatisfied with the way Mr. Connolly oversaw their business, and his assessment of the park owners' being slow to the mark ''far from true.''</p>
        <p>''We want to be safe,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''We also want to stay in business. There has to be some kind of partnership here. Some kind of balance struck. We're not the enemy.</p>
        <p>''Take the Tilt-a-Whirl,'' he said, ''a nice little ride that's been around forever. Instead of having that ride approved by the state for use in New Jersey, they make each and every operator go through the whole long ride approval process, supply all the manuals they already have and submit all the engineering specs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Connolly called this year's low injury rate good news. ''The bad news is that these kinds of changes only take place when there are strict scrutinies of the ride engineering and standards,'' he said.</p>
