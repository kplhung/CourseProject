        <p>BRIANNE NEIDECKER of Lynbrook would be the first to admit she wasn't quite ready when she enrolled at Nassau Community College in 1997. She would sign up for a course, go to a few classes and then drop it when she got bored. It took her three years to get her associate's degree.</p>
        <p>Now as Ms. Neidecker, 19, heads off to St. John's University to get a bachelor's degree in criminal justice, she goes as a true believer in the community college that she says has prepared her well for life at a four-year college.</p>
        <p>''I tell everybody they should come here instead of wasting their parents' money before they know what they're going to do with themselves,'' she said. ''I needed the time to mature and this was the best place for me.''</p>
        <p>Of the 22,000 students who started classes at Nassau Community College last week, there are probably thousands of recent high school graduates like Ms. Neidecker -- uncertain and in need of a little extra attention and direction. There are others who could handle the rigors of a four-year college, but want to work part time so they can save enough to finish college. And there are non-traditional students -- people leaving the workforce to study and change careers or mothers returning to school after raising a family.</p>
        <p>They may attend the school for different reasons, but they all go for the same thing -- two years' worth of credits from a well-respected institution where professors' salaries are near the top for two-year colleges nationwide, even though the tuition, $2,200 a year, is the lowest in the state.</p>
        <p>The college's tuition and finances were put in doubt recently when the county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, threatened to cut the college's proposed $135.7 million budget. He rejected a proposed tax increase to pay for increased costs and instead recommended a $95-a-year tuition increase. The County Legislature rejected his plan and developed a compromise plan that included a tax increase smaller than the one urged by the college and restored some, but not all of the proposed cuts. Tuition was increased by $50.</p>
        <p>The negotiations raised questions about the college's worth to Nassau County, which in theory is supposed to account for a third of the college's budget, with the state and student tuition paying the rest. Given the county's budget crisis, should and could it continue to support the school?</p>
        <p>County legislators responded with a resounding yes when they approved a tax increase of $3.85 a year for the average homeowner, to be devoted solely to the college budget.</p>
        <p>The measure was approved unanimously and was thus veto-proof. But Mr. Gulotta said he disagreed with the tax increase because ''I believe very strongly that wherever possible, only the people who utilize services should pay for those services, not the general public.''</p>
        <p>Legislators argued that sustaining N.C.C., the largest undergraduate college in the state, should be a priority. ''It's one of the county's anchors,'' said Judith A. Jacobs, the Legislature's Democratic majority leader. ''Long Island is very often looking for areas of identity and the college is one of them. You can't put a number to its worth.''</p>
        <p>Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader, agreed. ''The college gives people a relatively modest means to get two years of college and then go on and transfer to any four-year college in the United States,'' he said. ''This is a way to get a top-notch education for less than half the price and it's one of the things that makes the county a great place to live.''</p>
        <p>(Actually it is not necessary to live in Nassau to attend its community college. About 15 percent of its students come from outside the county and are charged double the residents' tuition, though the difference is usually made up by remittances from the county where the student resides.)</p>
        <p>Many county officials saw the college's budget struggle as a preview of the county's impending efforts to restore its overall financial health. In the proposal Mr. Gulotta submitted last week for cutting $75 million from the county's budget, he proposed raising property taxes by an average of $33 per household. Legislators will spend the next few weeks reviewing his plan and some suspect they will have to play the political heavies, as they did in the college's budget, and propose even higher tax increases to maintain county services.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs admitted that a $3.85 annual tax increase carried little political risk. ''But it did show a willingness on our part to do what needed to be done to make the college whole,'' she said. ''It was a defining moment for the Legislature. I think everyone realized that we were going to be judged on our will and resolve to do the right budgeting for Nassau County based on what we did with the college's budget.''</p>
        <p>Nassau Community College, which is celebrating its 40th birthday this year, is the biggest of 30 community colleges in the state (Suffolk County Community College, with 20,000 students spread around three campuses, is No. 2). While Long Island boasts some of the highest-performing high schools in the nation and routinely sends graduates to elite colleges across the country, a full 25 percent of Nassau County's college-bound high school graduates enroll at N.C.C.</p>
        <p>Unlike many community colleges, Nassau's primary mission is not to provide occupational training for its students. While the college does offer career programs in areas like nursing, physical therapy and mortuary science, about 60 percent of its students enroll in its liberal arts program, with the specific goal of going on to earn a four-year degree. The college also offers a wide array of extracurricular activities and is one of the few community colleges in the country to field a football team.</p>
        <p>''We see the college as really providing the first two years of higher education,'' said Sean A. Fanelli, the college's president. To emphasize that point, an advertising campaign in the early 1990's featured students saying things like ''I graduated from N.Y.U.'' or ''I graduated from Harvard'' and then adding, ''but I got my start at Nassau.''</p>
        <p>Nassau Community College also generally gets students with higher academic skills than many community colleges do. Roughly 40 percent of Nassau's students need some kind of remediation course when they enter the school, compared to the 70 percent at two-year colleges in New York City and the national norm of more than 50 percent.</p>
        <p>Norena Badway, director of the Community College Cooperative at the University of California-Berkeley, which researches community college performance nationally, said Nassau's relatively low number of remedial students allowed it maintain higher academic standards. The school has higher graduation requirements in math, science and English than other community colleges in New York State.</p>
        <p>''Nassau has exemplified a highly academic community college,'' Dr. Badway said. ''That's not part of a community college's mission in general, but the community isn't telling people to go there to get a two-year associate's degree. They're saying, 'This is your first two years toward a Harvard Ph.D.' ''</p>
        <p>She also said that N.C.C. is unusual in its ''determination to serve its community well.'' To illustrate that she pointed to a continuing education program that has as many as 14,000 students and the state's largest program for older learners, which allows about 1,200 county residents over age 60 to attend classes at no charge.</p>
        <p>Nassau's graduation rate is roughly the same as all state community colleges. The percentage of students who graduated from Nassau within three years and statewide was about 28 percent in 1995, the last year for which data was available. But the percentage of freshmen who returned as sophomores at Nassau in 1996 -- about 69 percent -- was significantly higher than other state community colleges, where the figure was closer to 52 percent.</p>
        <p>The graduation and returning student figures may seem low, but college officials note that about 10,000 of the college's 22,000 students are part-time students and naturally would take longer to graduate. They also point out that many students go to Nassau just to take a few courses to improve their chances for a promotion at work or to transfer to a four-year college before actually earning an associate's degree.</p>
        <p>Vincent Ngan, for example, is a 23-year-old from Queens who just enrolled at Nassau. He had been a student at nearby Hofstra University, ''but I wasn't doing too well and it didn't really work out.'' Instead he will continue to work part-time as a computer support technician and work toward an associate's degree at Nassau, thought he didn't rule out the possibility of transferring back to Hofstra before he finished the two-year degree. He said he chose Nassau because ''I knew I'd get a solid education here.''</p>
        <p>To ease the transition to a four-year college for its students, N.C.C. works closely with the public and private colleges on Long Island, the most likely destinations for most of Nassau's graduates, to make sure credits are easily transferred.</p>
        <p>At Hofstra, Nassau provides the largest number of transfer students each year, roughly 300 of the university's annual total of about 800 transfer students. Mary Beth Carey, Hofstra's vice president for enrollment services, said that Nassau students generally arrived at Hofstra fully prepared to tackle their junior year.</p>
        <p>''A lot of them may have gone to Nassau Community College uncertain about their career aspirations, and their time there gave them a chance to feel out their likes and dislikes,'' Ms. Carey said. ''That makes them stronger students when they come here and it makes furthering their academic path here easier.''</p>
        <p>At the State University of New York at Stony Brook, transfer applicants from N.C.C. fare better than the general applicant pool, with about 79 percent of Nassau's applicants gaining admission compared to 50 percent of the total applicant pool.</p>
        <p>Gigi Lamens, Stony Brook's dean of admissions, said that the roughly 100 transfer students Stony Brook gets from Nassau each year include high achievers who went to Nassau just to save money as well as ''late bloomers who needed some help getting used to a college classroom.'' She said that Nassau was able to give those students the kind of attention and help in developing study skills that a sprawling university like Stony Brook often can't.</p>
        <p>But what allows N.C.C. to provide that kind of care is precisely what drives up the school's budget. There are no large lecture classes at Nassau and the average class size is 20. And unlike most community colleges, where only about 10 percent to 20 percent of the faculty members have doctorates, more than 40 percent of Nassau's professors have Ph.D.'s.</p>
        <p>More than two-thirds of the courses at Nassau are taught by full-time faculty members; at the average community college, only about half the courses are taught by full-time professors. Part-time, adjunct professors teach the rest of the courses and are generally are paid much less. Full-time professors at Nassau earn as much as $94,000 a year, putting it near the top for salary scales at community colleges nationwide and not too far behind Ivy League schools, where professors earn as much as $130,000.</p>
        <p>Dr. Fanelli fiercely defended the college's faculty salaries. ''It absolutely astounds me that the people who are ensuring the future of our nation are second-guessed when they make even close to six figures, but a ballplayer can make $2 million a year and nobody bats an eye,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He also said that Nassau's top salary of $94,000 is attained only after 31 years' experience and that the average salary is $65,000. He added that while some Ivy League professors may be paid comparably, they may only be required to teach one or two courses a semester while Nassau professors routinely teach four or five courses.</p>
        <p>Timothy Turner, the associate vice president for finance at N.C.C., said the college's budget practices had been recognized as sound and responsible. Even the county executive's outside financial consultant, Public Financial Management, said in a memo that the college's proposed budget appeared ''to be well thought out and reasonable.''</p>
        <p>This year's request for a tax increase, Mr. Turner said, was the first since 1987. He said that the county's contribution had increased only $1 million in the last 12 years, while the students' share had increased some $21 million. ''We were getting further and further away from the tripartite formula where the state, the county and the students each kick in a third of the money,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Students now bear about 34 percent of the college's financial burden, while the county handles about 30 percent and the state picks up about 29 percent. The rest of the budget comes from reimbursements from other counties that send students to Nassau.</p>
        <p>Among the budget cuts approved by the county Legislature are the elimination of a proposed $1.3 million increase in salaries that the college anticipated would come during its current contract negotiations with the faculty union and the loss of about $800,000 in funding for new computer and laboratory equipment.</p>
        <p>''We would have liked to get what we thought was necessary,'' Dr. Fanelli said. ''But we know we have to do our part in dealing with the county's budget problems.''</p>
        <p>He said he believed the college would be able to do the required belt-tightening without affecting programs too much.</p>
        <p>''We're unique in the higher education community because we provide universal access and we give students of all educational backgrounds opportunities they might not otherwise have,'' he said. But, he added, students wouldn't continue to enroll at Nassau if all it offered was an affordable two-year degree that wasn't easily transferable to a four-year college.</p>
        <p>''We have to maintain our quality,'' he said. ''Otherwise we wouldn't be the good low-cost investment that our students have come to rely on.''</p>
