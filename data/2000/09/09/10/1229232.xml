        <p>MORE than 200 people from around the United States who have pledged at least $100,000 to a Jewish day school through the Partnership for Excellence in Jewish Education will gather in White Plains next Sunday and Monday to be recognized for their generosity and to learn how to expand the pool of donors for the cause of Jewish education.</p>
        <p>None of the donors, who collectively represent the major branches of Judaism, will be solicited for more funds.</p>
        <p>Instead, the purpose of the event, called the Donor Assembly, is to enable the donors to study strategies to improve fund-raising efforts in their communities and promote the cause of Jewish day schools, the organizers said.</p>
        <p>Among the topics to be covered at the event at the Renaissance Westchester Hotel here are advocacy for Jewish day schools, faculty recruitment and the development of Jewish day schools.</p>
        <p>''We want to help this group of lead donors recognize their profound impact,'' said Rabbi Joshua Elkin, executive director of the Partnership for Excellence in Jewish Education.  ''Through informal sessions of donor to donor, and school to school, we hope to increase the donor group.''</p>
        <p>The partnership, a Boston-based organization, which was founded in 1997, is a national program intended to strengthen the number and quality of Jewish day schools in North America.</p>
        <p>''Our organization is designed to help seed new schools,'' Rabbi Elkin said. ''We recognize that well-run afternoon Hebrew schools have their place. Jewish camps have their place, and the Israel experience has its place. We're not presenting day schools as a stand-alone solution, and it's not a running away from public education, especially not in a place like Westchester. It's more that day schools are becoming more mainstream, as parents are searching for value-laden Jewish education that is deeper than what they had had.''</p>
        <p>In Westchester, the Jewish day schools are Westchester Day School and Hebrew High School (Orthodox) in Mamaroneck; Solomon Schechter of Westchester (Conservative) in White Plains, which just broke ground for a new high school in Greenburgh; Westchester-Fairfield Hebrew Academy (Conservative) in Port Chester, and Stein Yeshiva (Orthodox) in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>Nationally, according to a census of Jewish day schools in the United States conducted for the Avi Chai Foundation in Manhattan and published in January, there were about 185,000 students enrolled in about 670 schools in 1998-1999.</p>
        <p>Organizers of the Donor Assembly decided to meet in White Plains mainly because of logistics.</p>
        <p>''The main reason is that the chair of our board, Michael Steinhardt, is a New Yorker who has a home in the city and in Mount Kisco,'' Rabbi Elkin said.</p>
        <p>''The Steinhardts offered to host a reception at their home, and we needed to pick a site that was within an easy commute of their home. And Westchester County, like many other parts of the country, is significant in the area of Jewish education with lots of growth activity.''</p>
