        <p>Something was up at the fall men's shows / something that was telegraphed as much through the music played as through the clothes parading down the runway. Frank Sinatra crooning for Puff Daddy's jeans line? Billie Holiday wailing ''God Bless the Child'' at virtually every stop? Clearly designers were in a mood for the classics, but, to paraphrase Frank, they did it their way. And the overall effect, witty indulgences and all, was completely elegant and satisfying.</p>
        <p>It is odd that in a time of dressed-down Fridays (and every other day of the week), the suit emerged as the season's No. 1 item. And these were for the most part serious suits -- shouldered and shaped, with vests and double-breasted jackets. Epitomizing the trend, Prada chose not to show its techno-flavored Sport line at all, opting instead for a decidedly dressed-up collection, starring a closely fitted, double-breasted suit and tie just right for a 21st-century tycoon.</p>

        <p>Something was up at the fall men's shows / something that was telegraphed as much through the music played as through the clothes parading down the runway.

        <p>It is odd that in a time of dressed-down Fridays (and every other day of the week), the suit emerged as the season's No. 1 item. And these were for the most part serious suits -- shouldered and shaped, with vests and double-breasted jackets. Epitomizing the trend, Prada chose not to show its techno-flavored Sport line at all, opting instead for a decidedly dressed-up collection, starring a closely fitted, double-breasted suit and tie just right for a 21st-century tycoon.</p>
        <p>Sportswear took a sophisticated turn, too, with the new black turning out to be (surprise!) black, once again. There was lots of black leather in bombers, blazers, pants and trench coats, one of the season's most popular items. But outerwear reaches dizzying heights when it's made of crocodile, python, ostrich, Persian lamb, even astrakhan, dramatizing the new appreciation for over-the-top luxury. And you thought the 80's were flashy.</p>
        <p>In stark contrast to this opulence, there were plenty of clothes for the guy who prefers something more understated -- styles with a tweedy, homespun feeling like wool herringbone and shearling jackets and coats, moleskin and wool-check trousers, Donegal tweed and corduroy suits all shown in comfortable shades of tobacco, sage, brown and tan. Note, please, the emergence of the streamlined, zip-front cardigan, leaving its stodgy, Jimmy Carter image far behind.</p>
        <p>That most basic of masculine colors, camel, has also received a new lease on life. Marc Jacobs did a preppy shawl-collared sweater, tie and trousers, Helmut Lang a suit and tie and Gucci a crocodile topcoat, turtleneck sweater and trim-cut trousers, all in camel.</p>
        <p>Those not afraid of color -- orange, raspberry, purple -- will find it in beefy sweaters with a rustic, hand-knit feeling. And to complement those sweaters, there were plenty of plaid pants from traditionalists like Tommy Hilfiger, who provided a definite alternative to the sea of solids.</p>
        <p>Clearly these are clothes conceived for a prosperous society, a world where men are not afraid to flaunt their success . . . at least to some degree. Depending on your own sense of taste and personal restraint, fall's reconceived classics can take you wherever you want to go, from refined and elegant to outright ostentatious.</p>
