        <p>THIS fall will be a season of radical departures, with an astonishing number of musicals from directors new to the genre and an action film from a director who made his name with finely tuned pictures based in the comedy of manners.</p>
        <p>The stretch would seem to be revivifying: many of the films have a restorative vigor. ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' is a period Hong Kong action film from Ang Lee, whose best-known movies -- ''Eat Drink Man Woman,''  ''Sense and Sensibility,''  ''The Ice Storm'' -- have pinpointed, with refined comic feeling, the disruptive and sometimes microscopic bumps in social interactions that lead to discomfort.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee's silken restraint is evident in ''Crouching Tiger,'' an elegant, literally high-flying epic whose blade-swinging heroes soar around on the wire rigs that are now a hoary tradition in Hong Kong action movies. Mr. Lee's patience as a storyteller gives the film a relaxed urbanity new to the genre; he has such deep-down confidence in his cast -- Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi -- and in his filmmaking skills that nothing feels rushed. It's a gift he applies to a type of material he's never attempted before; the graft takes.</p>
        <p>There's more genre-bending going on in the spate of musicals arriving this fall, from the established directors Joel and Ethan Coen (''O Brother, Where Art Thou?''), Lars von Trier (''Dancer in the Dark''), Wong Kar-wai (''In the Mood for Love'') and Baz Luhrmann (''Moulin Rouge'') and from the first-time feature film director Stephen Daldry (''Billy Elliott''). Movie musicals were presumed dead, both by audiences old enough to have grown up with them and by younger viewers, born into MTV, who had sought them out as a source -- of either inspiration or pillage, depending on your point of view -- for the music video. In their way, music videos have kept the form's romantic impulse alive (while it looked as though movie studios would never make another). And some filmmaking techniques -- which started off as experimental but lapsed quickly into cliche from overuse -- have taken these MTV and BET mini-musicals into altogether different territory.</p>
        <p>The good news is that in the films I've seen, directors are using music to personalize their pictures. There's honest sentiment in them, rather than the respectful entombment that has made the occasional attempt to revive the form (in limp pictures like ''Evita'') such a letdown. Even a film that isn't, strictly speaking, a musical, Cameron Crowe's ''Almost Famous,'' uses the rock and pop of the early 1970's for its ability to voice feelings and, eventually, heal wounds. (''Almost Famous'' is such a personal statement for Mr. Crowe that its opening credits are scrawled in his handwriting.)</p>
        <p>The Coen brothers, who have often made music a part of their films, have gone into full-scale delirium with ''O Brother,'' a lovely and assaultive pastiche that quotes from almost every memorable movie ever made and whose musical interludes are employed for their ability to soothe. Mr. Wong has woven music so deftly into the textures of ''In the Mood for Love'' that the songs are on a par with the images in the film's portrayal of heartsick desire; ''Love'' is all mood and music, a dream from a director who's temperamentally unable to think in narrative terms. And he's free of the kind of moist corniness that lies at the heart of all traditional musicals -- a quality the Coens embrace and comment on in ''Brother.''</p>
        <p>The one element these musicals share is that they're all period pieces. ''Brother'' is set in the 1930's, and uses a digital desaturation process that drains so much color from the film that it's virtually black and white for a good portion of the running time; ''Love'' is set in the early 1960's, as is Mr. von Trier's ''Dancer in the Dark.'' Even ''Billy Elliott'' (which was originally called ''Dancer''), the story of a young boy in a mining town who takes to ballet as a means of escape, is set in the past, albeit in the more recent past. Its 1980's period is appropriate for the what-a-feeling ''Flashdance'' plot turns -- even its climax recalls ''Flashdance.''</p>
        <p>So while it looks as though musicals are in the midst of a resurgence, it may still be true that directors haven't found a way to use the form's conventions in a contemporary setting. (''Dancer in the Dark'' and ''Moulin Rouge'' use new songs, but they can still be said to be dependent on the past -- even if the warm feeling on which they rely is merely nostalgie de la boue.) Directors are taking advantage of the distance the musical form imposes, rather than solving the problem that prevents musicals from being a viable means of conveying contemporary concerns.</p>
        <p>The problem is the ubiquity of the music video, which has turned the show-stopper into a regular part of everyday life. Musicals evoke a specific kind of joy, and nothing is as mesmerizing as being drawn into a masterfully staged song-and-dance number on the big screen: music videos have diminished that pleasure a bit by miniaturizing it and making it commonplace. Directors whose instincts are best suited for musicals are often filmmakers with an eye for using space and creating tension in a confined area. Directors as varied as the Wachowski brothers and John Woo have those instincts -- and Mr. Woo has expressed an interest in the form, which he should be allowed to pursue.</p>
        <p>That ability shows up also in ''Crouching Tiger,'' a picture that has the range and radiance of a musical; maybe Mr. Lee should think about turning himself in that direction next.</p>
