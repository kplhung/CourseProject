        <p>MUSEUM  Quivering in Anticipation</p>
        <p>In support of the theory that every place is famous for something, Le Roy, N.Y., was the birthplace of Jell-O in 1897. It is also home to the Jell-O Museum, which recently announced it will be open year-round thanks  to a donation from Kraft Foods. The museum, in a renovated high school, includes the 1899 contract in which Jell-O's inventor, Pearl B. Wait, sold all rights to it for $450. The museum is at 23 East Main Street in Le Roy, 20 miles southwest of Rochester. Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Sunday 1 to 4 p.m. Weekend hours change after Oct. 31. Admission is $3; (716) 768-7433.</p>

        <p>HOTEL  Two Rooms, Garden View</p>
        <p>For those who hate bustling hotel lobbies, the Spaarne 8 near Amsterdam looks like a good bet. With only two rooms, hotels don't get much smaller. It occupies the ground floor of a restored 1765 gabled house along the Spaarne River in Haarlem, about 20 minutes west of Amsterdam. Each room has a terrace overlooking a garden and a flat-screen TV and movie library. Rates (at 2.48 guilders to $1) are $231 or $278 including breakfast, drinks, cigars and chocolates. Call (31) 23 55 11 544, fax (31) 23 53 42 602.</p>
