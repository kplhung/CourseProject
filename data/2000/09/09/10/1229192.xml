        <p>BEFORE the introduction of modern latex and acrylic-based paints, oil-based paint was the most common type of paint used for commercial and residential applications. There was also another type of paint that was made and used around the home, although today few people have even heard of it. This was milk paint, and it was made, as the name implies, with a milk base.</p>
        <p>It may seem strange to make paint out of milk, but milk has a protein, called casein, that has strong adhesive properties (it was often used as a glue) and which makes it an excellent binder for paint pigments. It is manufactured by drying the curd of soured skim milk. The powdered casein is then mixed with other ingredients like pigment, clay, lime and water to create milk paint.</p>

        <p>BEFORE the introduction of modern latex and acrylic-based paints, oil-based paint was the most common type of paint used for commercial and residential applications. There was also another type of paint that was made and used around the home, although today few people have even heard of it. This was milk paint, and it was made, as the name implies, with a milk base.</p>
        <p>It may seem strange to make paint out of milk, but milk has a protein, called casein, that has strong adhesive properties (it was often used as a glue) and which makes it an excellent binder for paint pigments. It is manufactured by drying the curd of soured skim milk. The powdered casein is then mixed with other ingredients like pigment, clay, lime and water to create milk paint.</p>
        <p>Because it could be made easily by do-it-yourself homeowners, milk paint was used extensively in homes built before the Civil War. Decorators and painters interested in restoring or duplicating period interiors use milk paint to re-create authentic colors and textures. Another reason that milk paint is enjoying renewed popularity is because it is made with natural ingredients. There are no solvents. It is non-flammable, biodegradable and non-toxic when dry.</p>
        <p>Milk paint is still being manufactured today and is available in some stores or through mail-order sources. (One source is the Old Fashioned Milk Paint Company, Post Office Box 222, Groton, Mass. 01450.) It comes in powder form and is available in a wide variety of traditional colors. It is also available in a colorless powder, which contains only the casein binder and other dry ingredients but no pigment. With this product, you can add your own powdered pigment to create milk paint in a custom color.</p>
        <p>The milk paint must first be mixed with water to make liquid paint. To mix the paint, start with equal amounts of powder and warm water in separate containers. Stir the powder into the water until you achieve the desired consistency. Let it stand about 15 minutes so the water absorbs all the particles. The paint may thicken as it stands, and you may need to add more water.</p>
        <p>One drawback to milk paint is that once it is mixed, it does not store well. It is best therefore not to mix up more paint than you can use in a day. If, for some reason, you are interrupted and must store the liquid paint, pour it into an airtight container and put it in the refrigerator. Refrigeration will only preserve the paint for another day. The powder, however, will last indefinitely so long as it is kept in an airtight container.</p>
        <p>Another drawback to using milk paint is that even though the final paint finish is tough and durable, it will waterspot and readily absorb dirt. (This makes milk paint impractical outdoors.) For this reason, most manufacturers recommend applying a protective sealer to the paint finish after it dries.</p>
        <p>You can use almost any sealer, like varnish or polyurethane, but they may darken the color of the paint finish slightly. Most milk paint manufacturers also offer a sealer for their products, which is water based and solvent free.</p>
        <p>Milk paint can be applied to almost any surface that is clean, dry and free of oil, grease, dust and dirt. Glossy surfaces should be dulled with sandpaper or a degloss solution. Metal surfaces should first be coated with a rust-inhibiting primer.</p>
        <p>When painting raw wood, first wipe the surface with a damp rag to remove dust. Seal all knots with shellac to prevent bleeding. When the shellac is thoroughly dry, you can paint the surface. Since milk paint is a water-based paint, it should not be applied with a natural-bristle brush. The brush fibers will absorb the water and lose their shape and resiliency. Use a synthetic-fiber brush or a foam brush to apply the paint.</p>
        <p>Even if you are not interested in painting with milk paint, you may come across it if you like to refinish old furniture. Do-it-yourselfers are often puzzled when they try to strip a paint finish off an old piece and find that it is impervious to modern paint removers. That is because the finish is probably milk paint, and it is unaffected by petroleum-based solvents. For many years, the only solvent that would dissolve milk paint was ammonia. Today, there is a remover made especially for milk paint. It is called Behlen PDE-Milk and is formulated to soften a milk paint finish so that it can be scraped off.</p>
