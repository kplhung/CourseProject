        <p>Riesling and the Finger Lakes triumphed in this year's New York Wine and Food Classic, the major contest devoted to New York wines. All the most important awards went to Seneca Lake wineries, the first time one region swept everything in the contest's 15-year history. Most winning wines cost less than $20; all can be shipped inside the state.</p>
        <p>Chateau Lafayette Reneau won the Governor's Cup for its '99 dry riesling ($11), which 16 judges voted best riesling, best white wine and best wine in the show. Its '99 pinot noir blanc ($8) was voted best blush wine.</p>
        <p>Nine of the 17 double-gold medals (requiring judges' unanimity) and 32 gold medals awarded went to rieslings, 6 to chardonnays. Many in the wine trade say Finger Lakes rieslings are the nation's best.</p>
        <p>Hermann J. Wiemer's '99 late-harvest riesling ($16), was voted best dessert wine; his '98 dry riesling ($9) won a double gold medal; his '98 blanc de blanc ($18) was named best sparkling wine.</p>
        <p>The best wines in various categories include Lakewood's '98 port ($13); Lakewood's '98 reserve pinot noir ($20); Lakewood's '99 Long Stem White ($6), best white blend; Lamoreaux Landing's '98 cabernet franc ($14.75), best red; Lamoreaux Landing's '98 merlot ($16); Standing Stone's '99 gewurztraminer ($16).</p>
        <p>Among Long Island wines, double-gold medals went to Peconic Bay, for its '98 chardonnay ($10), the best chardonnay, and Pindar, for its '97 cabernet port ($25). Single golds went to Macari, for its '97 Bergen Road ($32), best red blend; Gristina (renamed Galluccio Estate Vineyards under new ownership), for its '98 Andy's Field reserve chardonnay ($22); Palmer, for its '99 gewurztraminer ($15); Paumanok, for its '98 barrel-fermented chardonnay ($17); Pindar, for its '95 syrah ($25); and Ternhaven, for its '97 Claret d'Alvah ($24), a red blend.</p>
        <p>Sponsored by the New York Wine and Grape Foundation, a trade organization in the Finger Lakes, the contest was held Aug. 30-31 in Hunter, N.Y., in the Catskills. Seventy of the state's 140 wineries participated, and 442 wines were reviewed.</p>
        <p>The foundation is posting the results on its Web site, www.uncorknewyork.com.</p>
