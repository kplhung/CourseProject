        <p>Two For the Summit</p>
        <p>My Daughter, the Mountains, and Me.</p>
        <p>By Geoffrey Norman.</p>
        <p>242 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Dutton. $22.95.</p>
        <p>What a treat, a mountaineering book in which nobody dies or loses any body parts to frostbite, and, at the same time, a book about a parent and child in which no one is abused, abandoned or even overly fond of gin.</p>
        <p>Instead, in ''Two for the Summit,'' Geoffrey Norman's account of his adventures in mountain climbing with his daughter Brooke, there is good sense, good humor, a risky but nonlethal encounter with nature's grandeur and a deftly drawn picture of a father and daughter negotiating both mountains and the daughter's passage to adulthood.</p>
        <p>Of course, this is the father writing. It's entirely possible that the daughter will return with a revisionist version in which the old ogre forced her to strap on crampons when all she really wanted was to tap-dance. But I doubt it. The book rings true.</p>
        <p>The story starts with Norman's plan to climb his first mountain, the 14,000-foot Grand Teton in Wyoming, on his 50th birthday. This is no simple hike. It takes two days. There are rock faces to scale, with ropes and pitons. When he announces the plan to his family, in a burst of midlife pride, his older daughter, Brooke, 15, says she'd like to go with him. At first he says no. He's the one turning 50, after all.</p>
        <p>But, of course, he changes his mind. Norman, a journalist who has written for Outside, Esquire, National Geographic, Sports Illustrated and other magazines, portrays himself as a man used to the company of men and, at first, somewhat puzzled by daughters and his role as father. He refers to himself as ''empathy impaired.'' I think he protests a bit too much. He is deeply involved with both his daughters, from their youngest days. And he quickly realizes that teenagers do not often offer to join with their parents in a common quest, and only a truly foolish parent would decline such a chance.</p>
        <p>Norman had thought his daughter might slow him down, but although she does struggle with altitude, she proves a more adept climber than he. And conquering his worries about her safety, he finds a tender satisfaction in his daughter's skill and determination. Describing her making the first difficult climb on the way up, he writes: ''Brooke put her hands over her head, spread them wide for balance, then plastered her feet to the rock. She moved with conviction and was across easily and quickly, like she had been doing this all her life. I exhaled. Then I stepped forward and followed her.''</p>
        <p>Father and daughter both make it to the top of the Grand. But they find that one mountain is never enough. After she returns to school, the daughter continues rock climbing. The father continues thinking about a bigger mountain and eventually they decide to attempt the nearly 23,000-foot summit of Aconcagua in Argentina. This is one of the ''seven summits,'' the highest mountains on each continent. It's a three-week climb, not a two-day climb, but one that novices can do.</p>
        <p>They sign on with a guide who is one of the mountaineering elite, and join a group of other clients to make the attempt. Early on, long before they have reached base camp, when they are still hiking in thick, nourishing air, a defeated climber is carried past them on a mule, muttering: ''I couldn't make it. I just couldn't make it.'' At this point, Norman begins to wonder what he has gotten himself and his daughter into.</p>
        <p>Before the attempt is over they face storms and struggles, and the air is thin enough and the mountain high enough to defeat more than one climber in their group. The possibility of failure weighs heavily on Norman as the attempt progresses. And both he and Brooke face the limits of their strength and determination.</p>
        <p>I won't tell the outcome of the climb, but it's not giving anything away to say that long before the denouement, Brooke is moving past her father, both on Aconcagua and on the less tangible climb that is at the heart of the book.</p>
        <p>It's also fair to say that Norman comes to relish the sight of his daughter ahead of him, and that though she passes him, neither he nor the reader gets the sense that he is being left behind.</p>
