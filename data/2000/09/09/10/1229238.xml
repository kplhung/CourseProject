        <p>AT the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia last month, Dean Dennis, an alternate delegate from Colorado, stood on the convention floor shouting his lungs out for George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Back at work, though, Mr. Dennis keeps his mouth shut about the election campaign. As the facilities manager for the Pueblo Convention Center, he said, he tries to keep his work life and political life separate.</p>
        <p>''I'm not the type to back somebody into the company water cooler and fill them with rhetoric,'' said Mr. Dennis, whose wife, Ginette, is a Republican state senator.</p>
        <p>With the fall political campaign season gathering speed, many politically active workers in corporate America find themselves downplaying their activism while on the job, or at least keeping their politicking below the radar of frowning managers.</p>
        <p>Experts say overt political activism can cut both ways, advancing some careers while retarding others, depending on the circumstances. As a rule, though, both managers and workers seem to prefer keeping it low-key, an approach made easier by the Internet and e-mail communications.</p>
        <p>''Political activism within the workplace is divisive,'' said David Heller, chief executive of Internet Business Systems in Campbell, Calif. ''If someone's got strong views, we don't want to hear about them.''</p>
        <p>Formal bans are rare, but informal taboos are widespread. ''Most companies operate on a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy when it comes to political involvement,'' said Eric J. Wallach, who heads the employment practices group at Kasowitz, Benson, Torres &amp; Friedman, a law firm based in New York. ''They don't want to act like Big Brother and tell people what to do outside of the workplace. But they want employees to be discreet while they're on the job.''</p>
        <p>That describes the attitude of Mr. Dennis's boss. ''I don't care if our employees are involved in politics, as long as they don't bring their activities into the workplace,'' said Mich Sauers, chief executive of Global Spectrum in Tampa, Fla., which manages the Pueblo center and others.</p>
        <p>Rosa Erives's involvement in the Democratic Party is hardly a secret to her boss at Qwest, a telecommunications company in Denver: She took time off to serve as a delegate for Al Gore at the party's national convention in Los Angeles. But neither Ms. Erives, an operations analyst, nor her co-workers talk politics on the job. ''It's kind of an unwritten rule that we stay apolitical,'' she said; the furthest she goes is reminding colleagues to vote each Election Day.</p>
        <p>Why do politically active workers keep such a low profile? Some do so because  companies insist. While most states have laws forbidding discrimination against private-sector employees because of political activity outside the workplace, they also allow employers to restrict the use of company time and resources for politics.</p>
        <p>Such policies do not deter some employees from engaging in quiet, behind-the-scenes politicking beyond the boss's notice.</p>
        <p>Patrick A. Sweeney, an assistant public defender for Allegheny County, Pa., which does not have such a policy, said he is quiet around his mainly Republican superiors, but often discusses his Democratic views with co-workers, and even recruited several interns to attend a fund-raising luncheon for Representative Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island. ''There's a group of us who hash out a lot of the issues,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''Lately, the biggest debates have been about national health care and H.M.O.'s.''</p>
        <p>COMPANY computer systems are often used by employees to quietly send politically motivated e-mail messages or to surf political sites on the Internet, often without management's consent. The great majority of people who visit E-ThePeople.com, a nonpartisan Web site that helps users sign petitions and send memos to elected officials, do so from 9 to 5 weekdays in their time zones. ''People are definitely using company time to get out their political messages,'' said Alex Sheshunoff, the Web site's president.</p>
        <p>Of course, not all employers try to ban politics at work; some welcome activism, while many more look the other way. Daniel Lysk, an asset administrator in Little Rock, Ark., said he proudly displays his activism in the animal-rights movement and other causes. His cubicle is decorated with anti-fur posters and photographs of him dressed as a cow for a demonstration.</p>
        <p>He once had to tell his boss that he might not make it back to work on time after a trip to Indianapolis because, while there, he planned to throw animal feces into the crowd at the Pork Expo and might be arrested as a result. (He wasn't.)</p>
        <p>''I've definitely influenced people at work to support animal rights,'' Mr. Lysk said, adding that he also sends e-mail messages to fellow activists elsewhere during the workday. ''I don't smoke, so to me, these activities are my cigarette break,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many bosses might not appreciate such activities at work, but Dave Dillon, who supervises Mr. Lysk, said he doesn't mind. ''He isn't obnoxious about it,'' Mr. Dillon said. ''I let it pass.''</p>
        <p>He said he saw advantages in having politically active employees. ''I find that people like Dan who are passionate about a cause bring that same level of passion and caring to their jobs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sharing his view, for a somewhat different reason, is Douglas S. Stone, a law partner at King Hershey Coleman Coch &amp; Stone in Kansas City, Mo. Its lawyers are accustomed to working with city officials in navigating real estate deals. They feel at home in political circles and are encouraged to be politically active. Mr. Stone was a Democratic convention delegate last month and ran for a seat in the Kansas Legislature in 1998. One partner is a former councilman; two others have run for other offices.</p>
        <p>In such a firm, unanimity helps: all the politically active lawyers are Democrats. ''We all sit around and tell George Bush jokes,'' Mr. Stone said.</p>
        <p>Some businesses in other fields encourage employee involvement in politics as well, often because the chief executive is politically active. Many create political action committees and encourage employees to contribute, said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington: ''At some companies, soliciting political donations has become part of the corporate culture.''</p>
        <p>An example is Enron, the Houston energy conglomerate, which even suggests how much employees should give. Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman, recently sent top executives a memo on his stationery asking them to contribute $1,000 each to the Bush campaign, said Steven J. Kean, an executive vice president. This year, Enron and its employees have contributed more than $615,000 to the Bush campaign, he said.</p>
        <p>But there are limits, even at companies like Enron. ''We might tell employees to go out and vote, but nobody tells them who to vote for or passes out brochures,'' Mr. Kean said. ''That kind of thing is just not acceptable in today's workplace.''</p>
