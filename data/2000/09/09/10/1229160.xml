        <p>''ON OUR OWN TERMS: MOYERS ON DYING''  Not a title calculated to drive ratings, that's for sure. Four 90-minute reports on end-of-life journeys, with those on the road as well as their loved ones and caregivers. PBS, starting tonight at 9. A related article is on Page 27.</p>

        <p>September</p>
        <p>''ON OUR OWN TERMS: MOYERS ON DYING''  Not a title calculated to drive ratings, that's for sure. Four 90-minute reports on end-of-life journeys, with those on the road as well as their loved ones and caregivers. PBS, starting tonight at 9. A related article is on Page 27.</p>
        <p>''GIRLFRIENDS''  A series whose name may be the most-used word in comedies with mainly black casts. It's built on the relationships among four young black women -- and yes, that is the same number as ''Sex and the City.'' UPN, Mondays at 9:30, starting this week.</p>
        <p>* ''ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER''  The Oscar-winning documentary about the attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics comes to television. It covers the events from the hostage-taking through the futile negotiations to the violent conclusion. It includes an interview with the only surviving Arab terrorist, Jamal al-Gashey, who has been in hiding for 28 years. HBO, tomorrow night at 8.</p>
        <p>* ''TWO-MINUTE DRILL''  What does Michael Davies, the production mastermind behind ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' do for an encore? He does a sports quiz show, with Kenny Mayne as host and with three contestants showing off their arcane knowledge in an effort to win cash prizes that escalate -- but slowly. And only up to $200,000, not a million. As a producer put it: ''Hey, we're cable.'' Then again, how much should you get for knowing things like who has the Kansas City Royals' season record for home runs? (O.K., I know, it's Steve Balboni, 36.) ESPN, Mondays at 7, starting this week.</p>
        <p>''THE ELIAN GONZALEZ STORY''  And the winner in the latest rush to make a ripped-from-the-headlines movie is: Fox Family Channel, which beat out CBS, whose movie of the same title is not yet scheduled. Here a child actor named Alec Roberts plays Elian, with Esai Morales as his father and Laura Elena Harring as Marisleysis Gonzalez. The events should be rather familiar. Fox Family, next Sunday at 8.</p>
        <p>''FEAR''  ''Blair Witch'' meets ''Survivor.'' Young contestants compete to survive in a setting with a horrifying background while they are constantly harassed and scared out of their wits. They all have cameras attached to their vests. MTV, Sept. 21 at 10.</p>
        <p>''DIRECT EFFECT''  An effort to link online fascination with video fascination: viewers vote online for the next video they want to see, mixed in with the usual guests and live performances. It sounds a bit like Total Online Request Live. The host is the one-named Teck, of ''Real World'' fame. MTV, starting Sept. 25 at 5:30.</p>
        <p>* ''AMERICAN MASTERS: CLINT EASTWOOD''  One of the most reliably fascinating PBS series takes a look at the now esteemed actor and director as he hits 70. PBS, Sept. 27 at 8.</p>
        <p>October</p>
        <p>''JACKASS''  An off-beat show with silly pranks and antics performed by Johnny Knoxville, exploring the underground world of skateboarders. MTV, starting Oct. 1 at 9.</p>
        <p>''THE NEXT BIG THING''  Dean Olsher, host of this weekly one-hour radio variety show, wants it to be ''a show about anything.'' Planned segments range from an accordion lesson delivered in French to a matchmaker's interrogation of a septuagenarian reporter. WNYC (93.9), starting Oct. 1 at 11 a.m.</p>
        <p>''DEADLINE''  Nobody in television makes better crime dramas than Dick Wolf of ''Law and Order,'' but here he is trying a hybrid: crime and journalism. Oliver Platt plays a famous of-the-street columnist for a New York tabloid; he also teaches journalism, and he and his team of young students investigate crimes on the side. The cast includes such familiar names as Bebe Neuwirth, Lili Taylor and Tom Conti. NBC, Mondays at 9, starting Oct 2.</p>
        <p>* ''FRONTLINE: THE CHOICE''  In what is now something of a tradition, the documentary series takes a close look at the men running for president. Reported by Peter Boyer, the program promises to avoid pundits and stick to friends, mentors and historians. PBS, Oct. 2 at 9.</p>
        <p>''TUCKER''  In television, no good show goes unparroted. In this case, ''Malcolm in the Middle'' seems the obvious inspiration, though this is clearly a less-inspired version. A teenage boy finds his life in disarray after his parents' divorce, and he and his mother are forced to move in with his strident aunt and her slug of a son. Katey Sagal (''Married With Children'') is the aunt, while Eli Marienthal (''American Pie'') plays Tucker. NBC, Mondays at 8:30, starting Oct. 2.</p>
        <p>''YES, DEAR''  A comedy less notable for its premise -- two couples who are close friends differ about approaches to being parents -- than its cast, which features not one, but two former stars of famously failed ''must see'' Thursday-night comedies on NBC: Mike O'Malley of ''The Mike O'Malley Show'' and Anthony Clark of ''Boston Common.'' CBS, Mondays at 8:30, starting Oct. 2.</p>
        <p>''BUILDING BIG''  A five-hour look at some of the most spectacular structures in the world, including the Channel tunnel, the Golden Gate Bridge and the Toronto Skydome. The host is the author and illustrator David Macaulay (''The Way Things Work''). PBS, starting Oct. 3 at 8.</p>
        <p>* ''DARK ANGEL''  This is the first creative work undertaken by James Cameron since ''Titanic,'' and while not quite as ambitious, it is a highly polished piece of science fiction entertainment with a young star, Jessica Alba (''Can't Hardly Wait''), who commands the screen. She plays a superwoman type who has escaped a genetic experiment in a post-apocalyptic future, when the world's economic system has collapsed, and teams with a streaming-video journalist to expose the bad guys. Among her other amazing talents, Ms. Alba manages to support lips that look like they're been stung by a whole hive of bees. Fox, Tuesdays at 9, starting Oct. 3.</p>
        <p>''THE GEENA DAVIS SHOW''  Truly a star vehicle, this show wants to be ''Sex and the City'' crossed with a family comedy, a tall order. But then Geena Davis is a really tall actress. She plays a Manhattan career woman who marries a divorced guy (Peter Horton of ''Thirtysomething'') with kids, making her an instant mom. It's a well-positioned show that will do well if it's well executed. ABC, Tuesdays at 9:30, starting Oct. 3.</p>
        <p>* ''GIDEON'S CROSSING''  The season's most serious drama, with the estimable Andre Braugher of ''Homicide'' moving into medicine at a teaching hospital that takes on desperate cases. It's heavy going, especially with many patients facing terminal illnesses, but Mr. Braugher has big acting shoulders. Reuben Blades co-stars. ABC, Wednesdays at 10, starting Oct. 4.</p>
        <p>''TITANS''  The season's standout in terms of sheer silliness, the latest soap opera from Aaron Spelling seems unsure itself whether its hilarious hokiness is intentional. It's about the usual stuff: the members of a rich, venal family scheme to ruin one another, mainly through sex. Yasmine Bleeth has the juicy vixen role, though her supposedly venomous lines draw mostly laughs. But Mr. Spelling has mined this territory successfully before. Victoria Principal of ''Dallas'' makes a comeback as an older-generation vixen. NBC, Wednesdays at 8, starting Oct. 4.</p>
        <p>''GILMORE GIRLS''  A gentle, quirky multigenerational drama with a light touch about a mother and her daughter in a Connecticut town. Lauren Graham stars as the mom, with Alexis Blendel as the other Gilmore girl. WB, Thursdays at 8, starting Oct. 5.</p>
        <p>''C.S.I.''  A crime drama with a heavy emphasis on forensic science, this hour has a number of things going for it, including a reasonably intelligent approach and a cast headed by Marg Helgenberger (''China Beach'') and William Petersen (''The Rat Pack''). The producer is Jerry Bruckheimer, who usually blows things up in the movies. CBS, Fridays at 9, starting Oct. 6.</p>
        <p>''FREAKYLINKS''  Inevitably, we have a show about a Web site. This one has ties to the makers of ''The Blair Witch Project'' and tries to make a similarly scary name for itself. A team of young hunters of the paranormal traces strange links to the death of a team member's brother. There is, of course, a real Web site to feed the hoped-for frenzy of interest. Fox, Fridays at 9, starting Oct. 6.</p>
        <p>''THE FUGITIVE''  What's it been? Forty years? It's actually been 37 since the original series made its debut, and it's already been updated once as a movie, but the old chase is back. Dr. Richard Kimble, convicted of murdering his wife, runs from Lieutenant Gerard, while simultaneously seeking the one-armed man who did the deed. Tim Daly gets the David Janssen/Harrison Ford part, with Mykelti Williamson stepping in for Barry Morse/Tommy Lee Jones. In case anybody's still wondering, Dr. Kimble didn't do it. CBS, Fridays at 8, starting Oct. 6.</p>
        <p>''MADIGAN MEN''  Another show with roots in ''Sex and the City.'' This one would like to take a look at the male side, as long as that means men with Irish roots who share a Manhattan apartment and spout cute Irish aphorisms. Gabriel Byrne, a true potential television star, is the newly single man with a teenage son and a dad from the old sod, played by Roy Dotrice, who also played opposite Mr. Byrne on Broadway in ''Moon for the Misbegotten.'' ABC, Fridays at 9:30, starting Oct. 6.</p>
        <p>''THE TROUBLE WITH NORMAL''  What does that title mean? No, there is no character named Normal; instead, there are two paranoid characters who think their neighbor is spying on them. Jon Cryer, who has had numerous shots in television comedies in the past, plays the neighbor who is equally paranoid and actually is spying on them. They all go to a therapist. Many people have paranoid tendencies, which perhaps sets up a sizable audience, but do people who are paranoid find paranoia funny? ABC, Fridays at 8:30, starting Oct. 6.</p>
        <p>''THE DISTRICT''  A crime drama that aims to be edgy, but may be asking for trouble: a white police chief, played by Craig T. Nelson, moves to Washington to clean up a town where black leaders have failed. Some genuinely gripping moments could get lost in the potential controversy. CBS, Saturdays at 10, starting Oct. 7.</p>
        <p>''STAGE ON SCREEN: THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER''  A live performance of the current Broadway production of the Kaufman and Hart play, with Nathan Lane and Jean Smart. PBS, Oct. 7 at 8.</p>
        <p>''THAT'S LIFE''  Another show looking to duplicate the ''you can go home again'' premise of ''Providence,'' this quirky-funny hour has some nice character work from Heather Paige Kent (''Stark Raving Mad'') as a woman in her 30's who dumps her fiance and goes back to college, and from Paul Sorvino and Ellen Burstyn as her parents. CBS, Saturdays at 8, starting Oct. 7.</p>
        <p>* ''ED''  The one new NBC series that seems to be getting an affectionate response, this gentle, likable hourlong comedy is not big on laughs but it works because of its sweet characters. Tom Cavanaugh (''Providence'') reacts to the misfortune of losing his job and his wife (to the mailman) in the same day by fleeing to his hometown, a recurring theme this season. There he essentially resurrects his adolescence, reuniting with high school friends and even chasing the unattainable girl from those years. To accomplish that, he buys a local bowling alley, where he also dispenses legal advice. Even though it's from two of David Letterman's longtime writers, Rob Burnett and John Beckerman, it's a show that could give warm and fuzzy a good name. NBC, Sundays at 8, starting Oct. 8.</p>
        <p>''HYPE''  A cast of newcomers tries to bring the sketch comedy formula up to date in a weekly series of fast-paced parodies of youth-oriented movies and music. WB, still sticking to the recipe that built the Fox network, tries to re-create the magic of ''In Living Color.'' WB, Sundays at 9, starting Oct. 8.</p>
        <p>''NIKKI''  Looking for new venues and new characters, Bruce Helford, the creator of ''The Drew Carey Show,'' goes all the way to Las Vegas to build a comedy around a dancer on the Strip, played by Nikki Cox of ''Norm,'' who is married to a big lug who wants to be a wrestler. WB, Sundays at 9:30, starting Oct 8.</p>
        <p>''OLIVER TWIST''  The big ''Masterpiece Theater'' effort of the season, a three-part adaptation of the Dickens book with Robert Lindsay, Julie Walters and Michael Kitchen. PBS, starting Oct. 8 at 9.</p>
        <p>* ''BETTE''  The most anticipated new comedy of the season, with Bette Midler playing a version of herself, in the throwback style of ''Burns and Allen'' or ''The Jack Benny Program.'' Actors play the other members of her family, as well as her manager and accompanist, but the show is all about Ms. Midler, with a lot of her brand of broad comedy mixed with regular bursts of music. That has always been a winning formula for her, and it should be here, too. CBS, Wednesdays at 8, starting Oct. 11.</p>
        <p>* ''WELCOME TO NEW YORK''  A comedy with most of the conventions intact -- a fish out of water shines in a new work environment -- but in this case the writing makes it exceed the preconceptions. Jim Gaffigan plays an Indiana guy brought in to be a weather reporter for a television show in New York by the brassy producer, played by Christine Baranski. Watch for an unusual clash between Mr. Gaffigan's character and the entrenched anchorman, played by Rocky Carroll. CBS, Wednesday at 8:30 starting Oct. 11.</p>
        <p>''CURSED''  For how many years now has NBC tried to make comedies hits by slotting them in the ideal location, Thursdays at 9? So many that the title of this one seems all too apt. Steven Weber (''Wings'') plays a man whose comfortable life falls apart after a bad date, when the woman puts a curse on him. Yeah, and then what happens? That's the part that nobody seems to know. NBC, Thursdays at 9:30, starting Oct. 12.</p>
        <p>* ''CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM''  One of the wildest and most promising new series of the season. It is the creation of Larry David, the comic mind behind many of the greatest episodes of ''Seinfeld,'' and is improvised from basic story lines. Mr. David plays himself as a stand-up comic surrounded by dysfunctional, loony friends. It sounds like ''Seinfeld,'' but it's much different -- after all, it's on cable. HBO, starting Oct. 15.</p>
        <p>''AMERICAN EXPERIENCE: THE ROCKEFELLERS''  A two-part biography of the rich American family, from the early days of Standard Oil to the current generation. From producers who previously chronicled the Kennedy family and Ronald Reagan. PBS, starting Oct. 16 at 9.</p>
        <p>''SPIDERGAMES''  The first original daytime soap opera on cable, about a family investigating the murder of the most hated man in town. Everyone is a suspect and an heir to his video-game empire. MTV, starting Oct. 16 at 4:30, repeating at 11 p.m.</p>
        <p>''THE FEARING MIND''  Here's the concept: Stephen King and his New England family in a sitcom. A horror novelist named Bill Fearing has real-life horrors, including a mother-in-law who said she had one month to live five years ago -- and other wacky stuff like that. The British actor Harry Van Gorkum, whose name sounds like a Stephen King character, stars, with Susan Gibney. Fox Family, starting Oct. 20 at 9.</p>
        <p>''BOSTON PUBLIC''  A drama about life in a high school would not sound too promising if it were not coming from David E. Kelley, who has made ''Ally McBeal'' and ''The Practice'' into two of the best series of the last five years. Here the challenge is making daily high school life dramatic and funny, and it's a bit of a stretch. A plot in which a teacher fired a gun in a classroom drew instant protest, and Mr. Kelly promised changes. As usual, his writing is of a high quality and so is much of the acting, led by Chi McBride as an intense principal. Fox, Mondays at 8, starting Oct. 23.</p>
        <p>* ''HATE.COM: EXTREMISTS ON THE INTERNET''  A documentary about how hatemongers have used the Web to find new recruits, spread their messages and in some instances even set up hate crimes. HBO, Oct. 23 at 8.</p>
        <p>''THE MICHAEL RICHARDS SHOW''  Here is NBC's great comedy hope, the first new series starring a ''Seinfeld'' grad. And what's happened? It has been one stumble after another, not unlike the ones that used to afflict Kramer. Except that those were funny. The original pilot was totally scrapped. No one knows much about the new one except that Mr. Richards is still playing a bumbling detective. He does have co-stars now, including Tim Meadows (''Saturday Night Live'') and William Devane (''The Hollow Man''). NBC, Tuesdays at 8, starting Oct. 24.</p>
        <p>''FREEDOM''  More apocalypse mongering from the producer Joel Silver, who hit it big with ''The Matrix.'' Much about this one is ''Matrix''-like, including the premise of a resistance unit fighting an evil military elite that has taken over humanity. UPN, Fridays at 8, starting Oct. 27.</p>
        <p>''LEVEL NINE''  Crime fighting goes totally cyber in this hour about a secret group created to fight Internet villains, like hackers who blackmail airlines by threatening to crash airplanes. Created by John Sacret Young (''China Beach''). UPN, Fridays at 9, starting Oct. 27.</p>
        <p>''FALLING IN LOVE AGAIN''  Valerie Bertinelli, who was once in every other TV movie, returns to play a romantic role in another generation: now she's the mom with the teenage children. The kids plot to bring Valerie and Jeffrey Nadling, who plays the dad, back together in a story that is set on a tourist ranch in the wilds of Alaska. CBS in October.</p>
        <p>''SECOND HONEYMOON''  Roma Downey and Tim Matheson star in another movie about a couple that just can't seem to break up. Here the soon-to-be-divorced pair get a surprise 20th-anniversary gift from the family: a tropical vacation. It works wonders. CBS in October.</p>
        <p>November</p>
        <p>''NORMAL, OHIO''  A troubled comedy that still has a great asset, John Goodman, as star. Mr. Goodman plays a father who happens to be gay; he moves back to his hometown and comedy is meant to ensue. But this is an all-new premise -- a first pilot was totally remade -- so the result is harder to predict than usual. Fox, Wednesdays at 8, starting Nov. 1.</p>
        <p>* ''THE STREET''  The true heir to ''Sex and the City,'' because it comes from the same creator, Darren Star. This hour is full of similar steamy touches as it traces the overheated lives, both professional and social, of a group of young Wall Street brokers who are on the make -- in more ways than one. The clothes, the music and the moves are all designed to reveal the male side of the sexual play featured in Mr. Star's HBO hit. Adam Goldberg (''Saving Private Ryan'') and Tom Everett Scott (''That Thing You Do'') are among the big, talented, attractive cast. Fox, Wednesdays at 9, starting Nov. 1.</p>
        <p>''TIME TO CHOOSE: AN NPR/PBS VOTER'S GUIDE''  National Public Radio and PBS collaborate on a live three-hour broadcast just before election day. Jim Lehrer will be the anchor in Washington, with correspondents from both organizations posted in Atlanta, Chicago, San Francisco and New York interviewing voters, campaign advisers and journalists. NPR and PBS, Nov. 1 at 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>''STUDIO 360''  A weekly one-hour show covering culture, high and low, produced by WNYC and slated for national distribution through Public Radio International beginning in February. Kurt Anderson, the novelist, journalist and co-founder of Inside.com, will be host of a program offering stories and conversation about the world of art, from opera to comic books. WYNC-FM (93.9), starting Nov. 4.</p>
        <p>''JACQUELINE BOUVIER KENNEDY ONASSIS''  Yet another Kennedy family mini-series, of which so many already exist that they could fill their own cable channel. This one promises the whole story of Jackie, in four hours, based on the biography by Donald Spoto. Joanna Whalley, who has one other high-profile television role on her resume (''Scarlett''), here will try to impersonate perhaps the most famous woman of the 20th century. CBS, starting Nov. 5 at 9.</p>
        <p>* ''NAPOLEON''  A four-hour documentary biography of the French general and emperor, directed by David Grubin, whose previous films for PBS include ''F.D.R.,''  ''L.B.J.'' and ''Truman'' in the ''American Experience'' series. PBS, Nov. 8 and Nov. 15, at 9.</p>
        <p>''NPR CELEBRATES AARON COPLAND''  Marking the 100th anniversary of the composer's birth, National Public Radio will present a series of Copland concerts, talks and documentaries. The centerpiece is a live broadcast and cyber-cast from Coolidge Auditorium at the Library of Congress, where Copland's ''Appalachian Spring'' was first performed. NPR, starting Nov. 13.</p>
        <p>* ''AMERICAN TRAGEDY: THE UNCENSORED STORY OF THE SIMPSON DEFENSE''  Destined to be one of the most talked-about projects of the season, for better or worse, this adaptation of the Lawrence Schiller book has already been threatened with an injunction by new lawyers for O. J. Simpson. It is an account of his defense strategy and the cast of characters includes those familiar names Johnnie Cochran (Ving Rhames), Robert Shapiro (Ron Silver), F. Lee Bailey (Christopher Plummer) and Barry Scheck (Bruno Kirby). Told over four hours -- if no restraining order is issued -- by a production team led by Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana. CBS, Nov. 12 and Nov. 15 at 9.</p>
        <p>* ''AMERICAN EXPERIENCE: RETURN WITH HONOR''  A two-and-a-half-hour account of the sufferings and ultimate victories of a group of American airmen shot down in Vietnam and subjected to years of torture before their release. It includes film from the Vietnamese government archives. Introduced by Tom Hanks. PBS, Nov. 13 at 9.</p>
        <p>''DAG''  David Alan Grier is a talented, funny guy, but this is his third try at sitcom success and it's not the charm. Here he plays a bumbling Secret Service agent banished to cover the president's wife (Delta Burke, who may look too much like a certain young lady in a beret for some people's comfort). The idea is to make the comedy extremely broad, but that will require generating a lot more laughs than the pilot did. NBC, Tuesdays at 9:30, starting Nov. 14.</p>
        <p>''NOVA: HITLER'S LOST SUB''  About the 1991 discovery of a sunken World War II U-boat, found only 60 miles off the coast of New Jersey, with its unexploded torpedoes and the bodies of its crew still aboard. The documentary follows the efforts of the diver John Chatterton and his crew to identify and explore the boat, a quest that cost three more lives. PBS, Nov. 14 at 8.</p>
        <p>''LOOKING FOR LOST BIRD''  A story of a woman, adopted as an infant, who  searches for her biological parents, discovers they were Navajo and seeks to learn of their culture. Mercedes Ruehl is the star, with Jamey Sheridan as her husband. CBS, Nov. 19 at 9.</p>
        <p>''THE MOVING OF SOPHIA MYLES''  Della Reese of ''Touched by an Angel'' plays yet another heartwarming role: the widow of a cherished pastor who duels with an evil real estate maven played by Rue McLanahan. CBS, Nov. 26 at 9.</p>
        <p>''FOR LOVE OR COUNTRY: THE ARTURO SANDOVAL STORY''  The story of the brilliant Cuban trumpet player Arturo Sandoval, who refused to defect after the Castro takeover because of his love for a woman, but later did so, with the help of Dizzy Gillespie. Andy Garcia stars in a cast that includes Gloria Estefan and Charles S. Dutton. HBO in November.</p>
        <p>''GROWING PAINS: THE REUNION''  At first glance this seems like a project conjured up solely to get Leonardo DiCaprio into a television movie. But he didn't show up for this reunion, of course, so fans of the series will have to satisfied with Alan Thicke, who did. ABC in November.</p>
        <p>''IN THE BEGINNING''  Religious stories have been unexpected hits in recent years, so why not go right to basics. It's the familar roster, including Adam and Eve, Abraham, Isaac, Joseph and Moses, with a lot of special effects to enhance the telling. Among the interesting casting choices: Martin Landau as Abraham, and Billy Campbell of ''Once and Again'' as Moses. NBC in November.</p>
        <p>''IN HIS LIFE: THE JOHN LENNON STORY''</p>
        <p>A lot of Lennon's early professional life was covered in the feature film ''Backbeat,'' and that R-rated material seems unlikely for a network television movie. This one includes a bit of his troubled childhood, but shifts quickly to his efforts to form a skiffle band, his meeting with a mate named Paul, and so on. NBC in November.</p>
        <p>''THE MIRACLE WORKER''  Yet another version of the famous play, which has already been a television special and a movie. Now it's back to television, almost solely as a vehicle for Hallie Kate Eisenberg, who in her ubiquitous Pepsi commercials has not demonstrated quite the acting depth that this part has pulled out of the likes of Patti Duke. ABC in November.</p>
        <p>''UNFORGETTABLE: THE NATALIE COLE STORY''  A television movie biography of the singer, who endured several rises and falls before her hit ''duet'' with her dead father. NBC in November.</p>
        <p>''WIDOWS''  Three women with extremely different backgrounds come together after their husbands are killed trying to pull off an art heist. Over four hours, on two days, they team up to search out the killer. Mercedes Ruehl is the middle-class housewife, Brooke Shields is the low-rent actress and Rosie Perez is the used-car saleswoman. Lynda LaPlante, the creator of the great ''Prime Suspect'' series, also created the original of this story, which was a hit in England. ABC in November.</p>
        <p>December</p>
        <p>''THE CHRIS ISAAK SHOW''  The singer-songwriter plays himself in a semi-fictional story about a lead singer for a band who is very much like Chris Isaak. The musicians are real; many of the backup characters are not. The show has as much music as comedy. Showtime, starting in December.</p>
        <p>* ''QUEER AS FOLK''  In Britain, this brutally frank drama about gay life was a sensation. Rather than simply import it, Showtime decided to make an American version. Pittsburgh steps in to approximate blue-collar Manchester, and Hal Sparks, who was once the host of ''Talk Soup,'' stars as Michael, who is secretly in love with his childhood friend, a drug-addled advertising executive. The show is steeped in character complications, some comedic, some heart-tugging, all fiercely realistic. Showtime, starting in December.</p>
        <p>''SANTA WHO?''  The old guy crashes in New York, of all places, days before Christmas and suffers amnesia. Panicked elves have to hunt him down. Santa falls in with a Christmas-hating reporter and, of course, he lands a job as a department store St. Nick. Will Santa recover his memory in time to save Christmas? Leslie Nielsen, who already has the hair, if not the girth, stars with Tommy Davidson of ''Booty Call.'' ABC in December.</p>
        <p>January</p>
        <p>*''JAZZ''  Potentially the outstanding program of the television season, the latest series from the much-decorated historical documentarian Ken Burns examines the roots, glories and influences of the one true American art form, with an emphasis on the role of race, in 10 parts over 19 hours. PBS, starting Jan. 23.</p>
        <p>''BREAKING NEWS''  ABC tried to turn sports news into comedy with ''Sports Night.'' This effort turns to real news in a series about a 24-hour news channel where the cranky reporters never go to sleep. It stars Tim Matheson and Rowena King. TNT, starting in January.</p>
        <p>''NERO WOLFE''  The rotund, brilliant detective who never leaves his New York townhouse comes to television, a long while after he became famous as a descendant of Sherlock Holmes. Rex Stout created the character and gave him lots of odd puzzles that he and his legman partner, Archie Goodwin, could solve. Last season's television movie inspired this series, which A&amp;E hopes will snatch up the crowd that loved its Poirot adventures. Maury Chaykin is the portly, orchid-loving Wolfe, with Timothy Hutton doing the hard labor as Archie. Mr. Hutton also did the hard labor of writing and directing. A&amp;E, starting in January.</p>
        <p>''OZ''  A special mid-season edition of the summer hit, serving as the sub for ''The Sopranos,'' which put its third-season premiere off until March. So Tom Fontana stepped in with eight new episodes of his riveting, often brutal prison series. HBO, Sundays at 9, starting in January.</p>
        <p>March</p>
        <p>''101 CENTRE STREET''  A New York night court is the focus of this series created by the film director Sidney Lumet. The show will be fictional, but Mr. Lumet will try to make it look real by shooting entirely with handheld video cameras. A&amp;E, starting in March.</p>
