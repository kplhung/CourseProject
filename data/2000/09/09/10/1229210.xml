        <p>ONE is an Olympic veteran and a lifetime county resident. The other is a newcomer to the Games and a part-timer in Westchester. But by water and on horseback, two women will carry local hopes at the Summer Olympics.</p>
        <p>Cristina Teuscher of New Rochelle, a swimming gold medalist in Atlanta four years ago, could win another gold this time. Sue Blinks, a summer resident of Mount Kisco, is the leading American rider in dressage, but her goals are more modest. ''Bronze would be beautiful,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Teuscher is one of the pre-race favorites in the 200-meter individual medley. Her winning time at the United States Trials, 2 minutes 13.36 seconds, is the fourth fastest in the world this year. Along with Beatrice Caslaro of Romania, Yana Klochkova of Ukraine, Tomoko Hagirara of Japan and Joanne Malar of Canada, she is considered capable of winning any of the three medals.</p>
        <p>Since the trials, Teuscher and her teammates have undergone intensive training in Pasadena, Calif. ''I don't worry about anyone else,'' she said by phone. ''I just worry about improving my own time. And everything has been fantastic out here, all geared to swimming faster. I'm really looking forward to the Olympics.''</p>
        <p>Her longtime coach, John Collins of the Badger Swim Club in Larchmont, is rooting from afar. ''The U.S. record is 2:11.9,'' he said, ''and I think Cristina can break it. That should be good for a medal.''</p>
        <p>There could be another in the 800-meter freestyle relay, in which Teuscher's leadoff leg set up a gold medal in Atlanta. She may be a coach's choice for the foursome.</p>
        <p>And after the last strokes of the Olympics are over? Teuscher, 22, who has a degree in psychology from Columbia University, admitted this summer to having thoughts of leaving the sport. But she has so enjoyed this Olympic campaign that she now says, ''I'll keep swimming as long as it's fun.''</p>
        <p>For Sue Blinks, fun would be a third place in the team competition. She explained: ''The Germans and the Dutch are so dominant that the rest of us can only hope for bronze. They could field three or four teams that could outscore anyone else individually, so a team medal is the only realistic goal.''</p>
        <p>Dressage is a series of prescribed movements with precise positions for horse and rider, each using one of the horse's natural gaits and each scored from 1 to 10 points. As in figure skating, there is both a compulsory and a freestyle portion. While Blinks, 42, is ranked first in the United States, she is only in the 40's in the world ratings, with a personal best of 12th in the World Games two years ago.</p>
        <p>''I've always loved horses,'' she said. ''I grew up in the Midwest and took to dressage when I was quite young.''</p>
        <p>Blinks lives in Florida in the winter but spends summers at the Mount Kisco farm of Fritz Kundrun, who employs her to teach and ride his German Hanovarian warm-blooded horse Flim Flam.</p>
        <p>Flim Flam, 13, is considered one of the top half-dozen dressage horses in the world.</p>
        <p>''It was love at first sight,'' she said of Flim Flam. ''He's actually a very arrogant, egotistical sort of horse, but he's a real schmoozer. He pulls you in to his chest. It's great.''</p>
        <p>Kundrun, who acquired his love of dressage in his native Germany, added: ''In dressage there must be perfect harmony between horse and rider. Flim Flam knows he's a star. Every morning in the barn, he wants to be the first one served.''</p>
        <p>Kundrun, like his horse, does not lack for confidence. He made his reservations for Australia three years ago.</p>
        <p>Another Westchester native in the competition is the sailor Courtenay Becker-Dey. A Rye native, she has lived in Oregon for 10 years and will again represent the United States in both Lechner and Europe classes. She earned a bronze in the latter in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Two county residents are going to Sydney as alternates in rowing and will take part only if a qualifier is sick or injured. Bill Carlucci of Rye Brook, a bronze medalist in the lightweight fours in the last Games, is now an alternate in the boat. Elizabeth Smith of Bronxville is a skulling alternate.</p>
