        <p>Gail Hope Moss and John Stuart Baymiller were married Monday in Thira, on the Greek island of Santorini. John Kavallaris, a civil marriage celebrant, officiated at Kastro, a restaurant.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Baymiller, 60, is the senior librarian for the picture collection at the Mid-Manhattan Library. She graduated from Bridgeport University and received master's degrees in art education from the College of New Rochelle and in library science from Columbia. She is the daughter of the late Rosemary and Morris Oken. Her father was a physician with a general practice in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baymiller, 57, is an architect and an urban designer at Marc Weissman Associates, an architecture firm in Manhattan. He graduated from the University of Virginia and received a master's degree in architecture and urban design from Washington University. He is a son of Marian Baymiller of Princeton, N.J., and the late John W. Baymiller. His father was a research chemist at Armstrong World Industries, the floor and ceiling materials maker in Lancaster, Pa. The bridegroom has twice been divorced, the bride once.</p>
        <p>The couple met in October 1997, after the bride placed an ad in the personals column of New York magazine, which read in part, ''Animal lover a plus.''</p>
        <p>''You should never trust a person who doesn't like animals,'' said Ms. Moss, whose two Siberian huskies had recently died.</p>
        <p>With two dogs, each a mix of Doberman pinscher and Labrador retriever, Mr. Baymiller fit the bill.</p>
        <p>''She was the right age, and an animal lover, and she was straightforward,'' Mr. Baymiller said as to why he answered the ad.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moss received 11 responses, but replied only to his.</p>
        <p>''He sent me a two-page handwritten reply, and his writing is almost like calligraphy,'' the bride said. ''He also said he spends three hours a day walking his dogs, which was good because that is what I would do if I had dogs.''</p>
        <p>After he received her reply to his letter, he popped up at her job, which Mrs. Baymiller found a pleasant surprise. After a five-minute meeting, during which they made a dinner date for a few days later, Mrs. Baymiller told her colleagues, ''This is the man I want to marry.''</p>
