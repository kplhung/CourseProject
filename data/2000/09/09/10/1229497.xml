        <p>The leaders made lofty pledges in a declaration. That and three days of speeches won't solve the problem, but behind the scenes, there was an innovation.

The White House said there was even a moment when President Clinton and Fidel Castro exchanged a handshake and innocuous chitchat.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore, who led one millennial roundtable, called it the organization's first ''interactive dialogue among leaders'' and suggested that the United Nations not wait a thousand years to do it again.</p>
