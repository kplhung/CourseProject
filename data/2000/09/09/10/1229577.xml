        <p>AMERICAN collectors in the late 20th century went bonkers over art. Week after week they chalked up records, buying Rembrandts, Renoirs and Rauschenbergs and becoming instant celebrities at black-tie auctions in New York and London. The consumer society had met the art world head on, and collecting evolved into a sport of mass buying more reminiscent of the style of William Randolph Hearst than of Andrew Mellon.</p>
        <p>Once awakened, the obsessive appetite for art spawned more grand acquisitors than the world had ever seen. Armed with the basics from Art 101 and from visiting museums everywhere, many collectors -- school teachers, salesmen, rock stars and Wall Street arbitrageurs -- looked beyond the paintings and sculpture that had once satisfied most elite art buyers. Instead they looked to acquire exotic and everyday things. They amassed so much quality French furniture, Chinese bronzes, Japanese screens, German toy trains, Venetian glass, African masks and American folk art that they sometimes surpassed the museums. And since it was no fun to play alone with their adult toys, they lent, gave or sold their objects to museums, and occasionally even paid for the galleries and wings to accommodate the pieces.</p>
        <p>The collecting phenomenon enriched most everyone -- buyers, sellers, museums and the public. But there were drawbacks when collectors gained too much power, lending art of lesser quality, dictating how their art should be displayed or using an exhibition as a launching pad for an auction. For the most part, though, such practices are the exceptions.</p>
        <p>In the year ahead there will be an amazing variety of private art collections starring in exhibitions at museums across the country. Three in New York illustrate why private art collections are formed, why museums exhibit them -- and in some cases acquire them -- and why museumgoers find them irresistible.</p>
        <p>When word gets around that a quintessential collection, of even the most esoteric material, is about to go on view, the show becomes a must see for serious art enthusiasts. One such show, ''The Embodied Image: Chinese Calligraphy From the John B. Elliott Collection,'' opens next Friday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''The most important and comprehensive exhibition of its kind ever assembled in the West,'' the press release announces.</p>
        <p>The 55 masterworks from the Elliott collection take center stage in the show. It also includes works from the museum's own holdings that were collected by John M. Crawford Jr., heir to an oil-drilling fortune, and a group of rubbings of early engraved calligraphies, lent by Robert H. Ellsworth, a New York dealer.</p>
        <p>Before he bought calligraphy, Mr. Elliott, a Wall Street financier, dabbled in Japanese folk art. In 1967, he started at the top, buying a dynamic work of bold, diagonal strokes by the 11th-century poet Huang Tingjian, a work that remains the most important in the collection. With the help of Wen C. Fong, a professor of art history at Princeton University (later a consultant to the Metropolitan Museum), Mr. Elliott had acquired the bulk of his calligraphies by 1970, but added rarities as he found them until his death in 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Elliott always collected ''with an institutional perspective,'' as Maxwell K. Hearn, curator of Asian art at the Metropolitan Museum, put it. Mr. Elliott's interest in Asian art began while he was a student at Princeton University in the 1950's. He had wanted to build a pre-eminent collection and leave it to the museum at Princeton (which he ultimately did). But his dream, which he shared with Mr. Crawford, a bibliophile and arts patron who died in 1988, was to have  their collections exhibited together at the Metropolitan Museum. Now their dream will be realized.</p>
        <p>OTHER collectors become involved with a museum at the start of their collecting, consciously making selections with the needs of the museum in mind. This approach is apparent in ''An Engagement with Folk Art: Cyril I. Nelson's Gifts to the Museum of American Folk Art,'' which will be on view through Jan.7.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nelson began collecting American folk art in 1972 while editing a book on painted furniture. Soon he was buying works of great virtuosity -- quilts, coverlets, stencilled watercolors, portraits, landscapes, painted furniture and sculpture, produced from 1800 to 1940. In 1974, he joined the museum board, always looking for ways to strengthen its collection. ''The quilts he favored are unlike any we owned,'' said Gerard C. Wertkin, the museum director. ''And we were very weak on Maine forms in furniture until Cy found an elaborately painted 1830's blanket chest.''</p>
        <p>Of the 113 objects that Mr. Nelson gave to the museum, 50 are in the exhibition. The quirkiest, a late 19th-century wood sculpture. ''Dove,'' once sat atop a pole in a Kansas grainery.</p>
        <p>Museums today are quick to seize on objects they think will attract new audiences.  And collectibles, like baseball cards and vintage eyeglasses, do just that. This season's ultimate pop culture extravaganza, ''Robots, Astronauts and Space Toys: The Robert Lesser Collection,'' will be an exhibition of 250 examples at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, from Nov. 10 to Feb. 1. Mr. Lesser, a retired electric-sign salesman, amassed one of the most extensive collections of toy robots from the 1930's to the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Arnold Lehman, the museum director, came upon the robots while visiting Mr. Lesser to see his collection of pulp art of the 30's and 40's. The robots were chockablock in the apartment, and Mr. Lehman was dazzled. He immediately persuaded Mr. Lesser to lend the collection to the museum.</p>
        <p>''Today, everyone is able to collect something,'' Mr. Lehman said. ''For me the kind of mentality represented in this collection is totally fascinating. We talk about 19th-century American paintings as the romance of the wilderness. Well, robots are about romance, too -- the romance of outer space.''</p>
