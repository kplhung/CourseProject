        <p>TWO Rye residents are about to board a hot-air balloon. They are Steven Cadenhead and his wife, Melanie, who is looking less than thrilled. The ride was actually Mrs. Cadenhead's idea, a birthday gift for her husband, but you wouldn't guess it from her ''not good with heights'' mumbles. Unlike his wife, Mr. Cadenhead, camera in hand, is a cyclone of excitement. He is carrying forth on the magical beauty they are about to experience. Mrs. Cadenhead looks a touch green.</p>
        <p>Save for one big detail, everything about the Cadenheads' flight is a known quantity. They paid Above the Clouds, the balloon's owner, $189 each for the flight. Their pilot's name is Chris Healy. The balloon is scheduled to lift off at 6 p.m. It is flying from Randall Airport in Middletown, N.Y.</p>

        <p>TWO Rye residents are about to board a hot-air balloon. They are Steven Cadenhead and his wife, Melanie, who is looking less than thrilled. The ride was actually Mrs. Cadenhead's idea, a birthday gift for her husband, but you wouldn't guess it from her ''not good with heights'' mumbles. Unlike his wife, Mr. Cadenhead, camera in hand, is a cyclone of excitement. He is carrying forth on the magical beauty they are about to experience. Mrs. Cadenhead looks a touch green.</p>
        <p>Save for one big detail, everything about the Cadenheads' flight is a known quantity. They paid Above the Clouds, the balloon's owner, $189 each for the flight. Their pilot's name is Chris Healy. The balloon is scheduled to lift off at 6 p.m. It is flying from Randall Airport in Middletown, N.Y.</p>
        <p>No one, however, has the foggiest idea where the balloon is going to land.</p>
        <p>That's because, like all balloon pilots, Mr. Healy can only control when the balloon goes up and down. For lateral direction, he is wholly at the whim of the wind.</p>
        <p>This results in an inability to identify a landing spot ahead of time, creating a hornets' nest of potential trouble. For one, landing is smoothest when people can be there to guide the balloon down with the ropes it drops. Two, some ground-level politicking is needed to calm those whose land you are commandeering when you plop from the sky. Lastly, balloonists need a ride home.</p>
        <p>Enter the chase group, people who follow the balloon in a van and, if all goes well, are there when it lands. But this chase often turns into a comical do-si-do, with one partner floating slowly high in the sky and the other speeding along the ground.</p>
        <p>That's because balloons don't follow roads. Add some trees and clouds into the mix, and the chase group frequently loses visual contact with the balloon, transforming those in the van into human bloodhounds, sniffing the sky. All they have to help them is a two-way radio, a map and horse sense about winds.</p>
        <p>In the chase group on the Cadenheads' flight are four people. They include the crew chief, Tim Riordan, whose nickname is Mad Dog and who works during the week as an accountant for a Big Five firm. The quieter David Annese still ''crews'' even though he has a 3-year-old daughter, because he likes the locker-room-on-wheels camaraderie of the chase van. Joe Fedor, 20, was an architecture student until he discovered that ''architects were off the wall.'' Now he is thinking of theatrical lighting, and got involved in chasing three years ago because ''my sister's ex-fiance is the pilot's brother.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fedor, in turn, got his girlfriend, Jillian Beach, also 20, interested. Ms. Beach is ''in-between schools'' and got pinned between the balloon and a fence one of the first times she assisted in the landing. She has been back 11 times since.</p>
        <p>The chase group is compensated only informally. Mr. Healy usually takes them out to dinner after a chase, and he is giving Mr. Riordan flying lessons toward his piloting license.</p>
        <p>At 6:30 p.m., the balloon is ready to take off. It should land about an hour later, and the passengers will be treated to Champagne, courtesy of Mr. Healy.</p>
        <p>''Did you happen to grab the Champagne case, Mad Dog?'' Mr. Healy shouts.</p>
        <p>''Uh, I saw it,'' Mr. Riordan answers. ''But I didn't bring it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Healy's glare says it all: bad Mad Dog.</p>
        <p>This means that while following the balloon, the chase group will have to make a detour to get the Champagne.</p>
        <p>As the balloon rises into the sky, the crew waves to the passengers until they look like mica-specs. They then sprint to the van. Almost right away, the group loses sight of the balloon. But they did see where it was headed, so the van rattles down Airport Road, then makes a sharp left to go across . . .</p>
        <p>There's a groan from the back seat. ''Golf Link Road Bridge is closed,'' Mr. Fedor yells. Mr. Riordan quickly slams on the brakes and does a K turn. He then heads back up Airport Road and sends news of the retracing to Mr. Healy.</p>
        <p>''You've got to be kidding,'' yells the pilot, as if he were talking to the Keystone Kops.</p>
        <p>''I know,'' Mr. Riordan answers sheepishly, ''bonehead move by me.''</p>
        <p>Within five minutes, though, the chase group spots the balloon, and Mr. Riordan is happy. ''We could be taxi drivers in Middletown,'' he says. But there is no time for self-congratulations, because they must still make the pit stop for the Champagne.</p>
        <p>The case is at Mr. Healy's house in Scotchtown neighborhood of Middletown. This is sacred ground for Mr. Healy, Mr. Riordan and Mr. Annese. All three grew up here, and it is where their interest in ballooning began.</p>
        <p>One day, when they were in high school, a French balloonist made a surprise landing in their neighborhood. The three rushed out of their homes and, bitten by the ballooning bug, befriended the pilot. They started to work summers for him, and the rest is history.</p>
        <p>Right before the van arrives at Mr. Healy's house, the balloon crosses gallantly right above. The giant, candy-colored object, moving at underwater speed through the sky, is a visual lure of the highest order.</p>
        <p>Cars stop and passengers hang out of open windows; people, gape-jawed, rush out of homes, an occasional one with camera in hand. In an age of cheap spectacles, there is nothing like a balloon overhead.</p>
        <p>The next 20 minutes of the chase are uneventful, until Mr. Healy's voice booms from the radio that he is ready to look for a landing spot. All eyes peel for a big, flat and treeless spot.</p>
        <p>''Do you guys know of any fields around here?'' Mr. Riordan asks. He hears back a chorus of ''no's.''</p>
        <p>''Uh-oh,'' Mr. Riordan says dryly. ''I see a few swamps, but no one has swamp gear.'' Just then, Mr. Healy spots a suitable landing area from the sky, but Mr. Riordan has no idea where it is, so the pilot directs him from above through several commands of ''right'' and ''left.''</p>
        <p>''There's a big, front yard, you see?'' Mr. Healy asks.</p>
        <p>The group pulls into the driveway, and the nonthreatening Ms. Beach is conscripted to ring the bell. The basic strategy of introduction is to say, ''Hi, we're here,'' and hope the homeowner doesn't protest the landing, even if it's only because they are caught so off guard that they don't think to.</p>
        <p>This usually works. Occasionally, though, people will fear lawsuits or lawn damage and will get huffy. If this happens, Ms. Beach will offer them Champagne, free balloon rides and the hollow promise never to do it again. A measure of luck in this instance: no one is home.</p>
        <p>Just then, though, an alarming shout comes from the balloon. ''We're short!'' cries Mr. Healy. The balloon has been approaching the lawn, but doesn't seem to have enough lift to make it. It is headed for a landing in a lightly wooded area 15 feet from its target.</p>
        <p>The crew plunges into the woods, grabbing ropes and pulling the balloon toward the safety of the lawn, but as they do so, with an eerie screech, then a sharp snap, the balloon snags on a dead, leafless tree. The skin of the balloon is pierced, opening up a two-foot tear. ''Aw, no way!'' someone yells. Seconds later, though, the balloon touches down gently on the grass.</p>
        <p>As the passengers get off, Mrs. Cadenhead allows that, save for the landing mishap, the flight had been ''exhilarating.'' Just the same, she says, ''for his birthday next year, I'm thinking Caribbean.''</p>
