        <p>TIME was, new mothers and babies met other new mothers and babies in the park. They still do, but with a twist.</p>
        <p>At the Bedford Hills Memorial Park beginning on Sept. 25, mothers will be able to try Strollercise, a program of exercises that permit babies in their strollers to join their mothers' workout sessions.</p>
        <p>Allison Segreto, 39, a mother of three, a personal trainer and the owner of Fitness for Two, is the first Westchester licensee of Strollercise, a company founded in Manhattan in 1991 by another personal trainer, Elizabeth Trindade, who developed the special exercises for her own use after her first child was born.</p>
        <p>''What's so unique about the program is that it meets the special needs of mothers.'' Ms. Segreto said. ''They don't need baby sitters, and the only equipment they have to bring is a stroller.''</p>
        <p>The classes, which last 50 minutes, provide cardiovascular, abdominal and toning benefits.</p>
        <p>''We start with a warm-up period where moms use the stroller to tone muscles with leg lifts, squats or lunges,'' Ms. Segreto said. ''Upper body power is strengthened by resistance, using elastic bands. Cardiovascular benefits come when the stroller pace is picked up.''</p>
        <p>As for the babies, Ms. Segreto said,  some fall asleep while others seem to find watching other babies and exercising mothers amusing.</p>
        <p>''However, if a child requires some extra attention or if a mother needs to breast feed during class, instructors will see to it quickly,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Babies range in age from 6 weeks to 18 months. And twins are welcome, Ms. Segreto said, adding that the same exercise technique works with a double stroller.</p>
        <p>New mothers seem to enjoy the chance to make new friends.</p>
        <p>''Many mothers are new to the area,'' Ms. Segreto said. Others recently stopped working, and the program gives them a chance to socialize and share experiences with other mothers.''</p>
        <p>Jane Lubowitz Rosenstadt, a deputy district attorney in Brooklyn, became a regular at a Strollercise program in Central park when her son Jake was 3 months old.</p>
        <p>''I have always worked out, and after Jake was born I was anxious to get back into shape,'' she said. ''You need all your strength to haul the incredible amount of baby gear around.</p>
        <p>''The program really works and is a lot of fun. It's also nice to meet other mothers. We have so much in common, we now socialize on our own.''</p>
        <p>The Strollercise program in Westchester is sponsored by the town of Bedford's Parks and Recreation Department. It will be run by Ms. Segreto and Kathy Margiasso, a certified fitness instructor.</p>
        <p>Fees are $180 for eight classes and $375 for three months of unlimited classes.</p>
        <p>For more information and registration, the numbers to call are (914) 666-7004 at the Town of Bedford Parks Department, after Sept. 11, or (914) 528-2444 for Ms. Segreto.</p>
