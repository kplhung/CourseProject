        <p>Catching Heaven</p>
        <p>By Sands Hall.</p>
        <p>Ballantine, $25.</p>
        <p>Sands Hall's first novel deftly reveals the push and pull between two sisters who love each other dearly, but who face new tensions when their lives collide in midcourse. When Maud, who longs for a stable partner and children, abandons her stalled acting career and empty relationship, she flees Los Angeles for the small New Mexico town where her sister Lizzie lives. Once a promising artist, Lizzie now teaches and paints pictures for a greeting card company to support the three children she has had by three different men. Despite her busy small-town existence, Lizzie is as lonely and unfulfilled as her sister. A vibrant supporting cast complicates and darkens the sisters' lives: Lizzie's alcoholic baby sitter; Maud's lover for one night, a Native American angry with whites who want to co-opt his culture; and the likable Jake, father of Lizzie's youngest child, whose return generates jealousy between the sisters. What could have become an overcrowded soap opera instead becomes a realistic story of two women trying to let go of old hurts and find love that will last.</p>
