        <p>CABALA, as its greatest scholar, Gershom Scholem, described it, ''is the traditional and most commonly used term for the esoteric teachings of Judaism and for Jewish mysticism, especially the forms which it assumed in the Middle Ages from the 12th century onward. In its wider sense it signifies all the successive esoteric movements in Judaism that evolved from the end of the period of the Second Temple and became active factors in Jewish history.'' It is also, thanks to Madonna with an assist from Roseanne, hot and hip.</p>
        <p>''Beowulf'' on the best-seller list, cabala classes all over: what's going on? The poet and translator David Rosenberg might be in as good a position as anyone to say: he has written books on translating ancient texts, and on the commentary on them (including, with Harold Bloom, the controversial ''Book of J''), and he is an avid observer of contemporary consciousness. In ''Dreams of Being Eaten Alive,'' during a long riff on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' he describes Winfrey both as someone whose ''great antecedents could be said to be Emerson and Whitman, who flirted with a distinctive American spirituality,'' and as a ''creative cabalist.''</p>
        <p>Could Rosenberg's stunning English version of excerpts from cabala make it onto Oprah's Book Club? Perhaps, for, as Rosenberg points out in chapters called ''How to Read the Cabala,'' which precedes his translations, and ''How to Receive the Cabala,'' which follows them, we are dealing with grown-up stuff here (most medieval cabalists stipulated 40 as the proper age for entering the ''orchard'' of cabala, although the great 16th-century rabbi Moses Cordovero thought 20 was sufficient). And although he doesn't make the association, the passages Rosenberg chooses include material not altogether unsuitable for daytime television: nocturnal emissions, cannibalism, sexual dysfunction and dream interpretation. And yet, when it's the patriarch Isaac's wet dreams that we are talking about, and the matriarch Rebecca's chopping up of her husband's grotesque dream babies, one can envision Oprah's producers getting a little queasy. In addition, Rosenberg confronts us with a powerful and abstruse prose-poetry, translations from the tough-to-decipher mingled Aramaic-Hebrew of the original, that makes for challenging reading when capsized into English.</p>
        <p>Most passages are taken from the Zohar (the Book of Splendor or Book of Enlightenment), a sprawling 13th-century work usually printed in three thick volumes and mostly written by the brilliant and creative Castilian rabbi Moses de Leon, although de Leon claimed, perhaps for self-protection or to garner an instant air of authority for his work, merely to have discovered and copied the long-lost text of a much revered second-century rabbi, Shimon bar Yohai. The Zohar largely takes the form of commentaries and homilies that follow the order of the Torah, but in the mystical world, quite different from that of Talmudic commentary, a laissez-faire attitude predominates, for it is the distinct insight of the cabalist that biblical verses are charged with symbolic mystery. Thus, at the far reaches of the cabala's theosophical system we find the mind-spinning calculations of gematria, in which letters are ascribed their numerical value, then retranslated into words that supposedly lie beneath the surface; at the other end comes a highly imaginative, almost post-Freudian reading to tease out hidden images of illicit sexuality. In all cases, however, the goal is to reveal, as much as is humanly possible, the divinity; radical though it is in its laddered vision of God's attributes, the cabala (the word means ''tradition'' or ''received lore'') always strives to respect the contours of Orthodox Jewish practice.</p>
        <p>Rosenberg has done a remarkable job in bringing to English some of the most unnerving and powerful passages in the early cabala (the later cabala of Isaac Luria and his followers, produced in the century after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, interests him less). His translations, as his title suggests, brilliantly heighten and reproduce the literary and artistic effects of the text and provide spine-tingling illuminations. Here, of course, is what your Bible teacher did not tell you but the masters of the cabala had no problem in discerning: ''The snake -- who was the fallen angel, Samael -- lay with Eve, his slime entering her, and thus she gave birth to Cain.'' ''Jacob climbed down from his crib and crawled toward his parents' bedroom, where he heard their whispers. Closer, he heard his mother's whimpers coming from the bed; then he saw his father above her, thrashing. He sunk back on his knees, transfixed with fear.''</p>
        <p>The cabala, Rosenberg tells us, ''is obsessed with failed sex, especially the spilling of semen in sleep or masturbation.'' To highlight this obsession he offers the most startling excerpt in his book, one that begins with Isaac's lengthy and electric explanation of a dream in which he has been seduced by a woman --  'You, scrollworm,' she whispered, 'I can read your mind' ''(presumably this is Lilith, who preys on the vulnerable soul during sleep) -- and fathered a child, whom, upon discovering, Rebecca has decapitated and chopped up for a stew. Rosenberg's strength is his ability to convey both the high dramatic force of the piece and the uncanny defamiliarizing of the biblical text on which it is based, while at the same time retaining an earthy humor that is almost contemporary. When Isaac has finished relating his story, Rebecca tartly says: ''I told you it was not good to practice union while drunk with the new wine. . . . You reproach yourself in your dreams but I have seen the results; I cannot hide it. I find your dried seed in the sheets in the morning. If you must have wine -- no more than a glass.'' This is Rabbi Moses de Leon as Lenny Bruce.</p>
        <p>There is an ''ecstatic'' cabala that involves breathing exercises and body posture, and which has obvious New Age attractions, but Rosenberg has, more importantly I think, attached cabala to secular life by powerfully reinstating it as a passionate, enchanting literary text. Unfortunately, his long chapters of introduction and conclusion are at times baffling and, with their strained analogies to ''evolutionary ecology,'' even infuriating, but the clarity, vitality and wild substance of the translations themselves more than make up for this. This is an exciting, discomposing book, and I intend it as high praise to say that ''Dreams of Being Eaten Alive'' won't make a good bar mitzvah present.</p>
