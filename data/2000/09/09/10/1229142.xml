        <p>IT was 1977. One of the talking points of the women's movement, then in voluble high gear, was the treatment of women in films and television.</p>
        <p>Every new picture was subjected to heated dissections of its overt or covert offenses against women -- if the female sex was represented at all.</p>
        <p>In the midst of this fairly dismal decade appeared ''Charlie's Angels,'' with its spectacularly coiffed, pistol-packing cupcakes, and we who were doing the agitating and analyzing didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Or simply surrender to the show's dippy charm.</p>
        <p>Having fallen, I'm ashamed to confess, into the latter category -- I'm a sucker for mysteries and it was part of my professional research (am I protesting too much?) -- I nevertheless can't warm to the prospect of a 21st-century film spinoff (opening Nov. 3) with three of Hollywood's hottest babes. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore (one of the movie's producers) and Lucy Liu, the smoldering Asian femme fatale on ''Ally McBeal,'' are stars in their own right, hence far more independently powerful than the members of the original trio, then virtually unknown.</p>
        <p>But that sense of discovery was just one of the modest enticements of the television show that can't be reproduced. Who knew Farrah Fawcett-Majors, she of the three-toned tresses and two-hand backhand; or Jaclyn Smith of the porcelain complexion and honey voice; or Kate Jackson, who became known as ''the smart one'' because she had straight hair, more tailored clothes and could actually act a little? (At least she could cock a pistol and say ''Freeze!'' without having us collapse in giggles.) They were, if not revelations, at least brand-new, hence without baggage, and could create a sort of girls'-night-out camaraderie as they went along, and a very sweet if ephemeral tune it was.</p>
        <p>The show, which ran five seasons, wasn't one for the ages, and its relatively poor showing in syndication, as compared with male buddy crime solvers like ''Starsky and Hutch'' and ''Magnum P.I.,'' may or may not confirm the axiom that the female action picture is a tough sell with general audiences. But then again, do Charlie's pulchritudinous hirelings belong in the same category with no-frills action heroines like Thelma and Louise, G.I. Jane, the ''Bad Girls'' western foursome, Warrant Officer Lt. Ellen Ripley (''Alien'') and the various Femmes Nikita?</p>
        <p>''Charlie's Angels'' was very much an artifact of its time, perched precariously on the borderline between snickering sexism and feminism-lite, as dated now as the posters (and name) of Farrah Fawcett-Majors. That it worked at all was one of those peculiar and unpredictable phenomena of show business, an amalgam of high concept and low chuckles, an alchemy of mythology, formula, self-parody and chemistry.</p>
        <p>Compared with the upgraded firepower we may expect from ''Charlie's Angels'' the movie, theirs was a low-tech enterprise, operating in a world before cell phones, gyms and Attitude. The sweet sensuality of the small-screen angels was a matter of halter tops and slender brown arms; lithe, boyish figures and dazzling white smiles; and a ready if not always Marivaux-level repartee. In other words, the three Nancy Drews with the fabulous hair, who set out each week to solve a crime and nab the perpetrators, were a cunning blend of rear-guard cute and jockess competent, ''Beach Blanket Bingo'' meets Title IX, a not inapt metaphor for the twin modes, victim and aggressor, between which women were oscillating at the time.</p>
        <p>The show, offering three ''types'' of babe to choose from, managed to strike sparks in crossover markets, from pubescent male fantasies to Girl Guide role models, with a nod to us ''humorless'' feminists along the way.</p>
        <p>These ''girls,'' as they were called in tweaking defiance of the taboo, were liberated women, but liberated from what? And by whom? ''Three little girls went to the police academy,'' announces Charlie, the unseen pasha, at the beginning of each show. (The orotund voice of John Forsythe will also be heard in the movie.) We see the recruits going through their paces at the firing range, jumping, wrestling, though, unlike Demi Moore's Marine Corps grunt, never strenuously or for long enough to work up a sweat or build a muscle. When they are immobilized (by the glass ceiling?) in ''hazardous'' jobs like typist, meter maid and crossing guard, Charlie comes to the rescue, placing the damsels in real (and titillating) distress in the path of blackmailers, murderers, con artists and pornographers.</p>
        <p>The girls brush shoulders with the sleaze and decadence of a modern L.A. without a speck of mud ever sticking to their peachy-keen personalities or their off-the-rack jump suits, tank tops and jeans. In one episode, a devoted son supports his aging mother's orchid habit (shades of ''The Big Sleep's'' General Sternwood) by churning out porn movies in his film lab. When the girls are obliged to watch these movies or, in another episode, go ''undercover'' as prostitutes (Ms. Jackson as Sabrina) and masseuses (Ms. Fawcett-Majors as Jill) or, in still another, sleepwalk around town in a lacy negligee (Ms. Smith as Kelly), they are as unbesmirched by sophistication as little girls dressed in Mommy's clothes.</p>
        <p>Mediating between the angels and Charlie is his avuncular factotum Bosley, played by David Doyle. Jaded critics, untouched by the angels, saw these two gentlemen more as procurers than protectors, noting that they and the girls fell into pimp-prostitute roles along traditional gender lines. But fairy tale analogies might be even more to the point: ''Three Little Pigs'' and ''Goldilocks and the Three Bears'' echo through the proceedings, the latter reversing neatly into Three Gorgeous-Locks and a Bear. Or we might see in the rivalry set up by their iconographic contrasts and implied differences a replay of the judgment of Paris, wherein he opted for Venus (Beauty, the fairest woman for a wife) over Minerva (Wisdom and Renown) or Juno (Riches and Power). Dispensing with the also-rans, Minerva and Juno, and getting right to the bottom line, the show offers only the choice between Beautiful and Strong (Smith), Beautiful and Smart (Jackson) and Just Beautiful (Fawcett).</p>
        <p>In one of the wittiest commentaries at the time, Lois Gould wrote a Hers column in The New York Times in which she polled little girls of 8, 10 and 12 on the impact of the angels and what she saw as a sudden ''confusion about the difference -- if any -- between a role model and a hair model.'' The message that little girls were taking to their pillows at night was that one could be a president or a detective or Amelia Earhart, a weight lifter or a nuclear physicist, and still be ravishing. But if a choice had to be made, it was beauty (i.e., highlights and sexy clothes) before business anytime.</p>
        <p>Now, presumably, with the blurring of once-rigid boundaries between male and female roles, and the prevalence of women, often attractive women, in sports, politics and business, the action heroine is no longer the anomaly who has to be softened, made acceptable, by precisely those ''feminizing'' qualities that undermine her plausibility, threaten to turn her into a harmless joke.</p>
        <p>The new movie will no doubt give us the real thing: powerful, enterprising women who haven't got time to look perfect, whose fingernails crack and whose roots grow out, who give their Bosley (Bill Murray) not girlish giggles but power-grrrl guff.</p>
        <p>And if you believe that, you'll believe that there's a vast new commercial frontier for women as heroines who play tough, crack wise and shoot straight, who make no concessions to glamour and are strangers to the hairdresser's art.</p>
