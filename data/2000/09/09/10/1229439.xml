        <p>In the last Around Alone solo round-the-world race, the winning skipper, Italy's Giovanni Soldini, showed his prowess not only at the helm but also on his laptop computer.

        <p>In the last Around Alone solo round-the-world race, the winning skipper, Italy's Giovanni Soldini, showed his prowess not only at the helm but also on his laptop computer. Soldini spent hours poring over his favorite Internet weather Web sites, and his ability to predict favorable systems and trends proved to be a significant advantage.</p>
        <p>If the Internet is altering the way offshore racers like Soldini play the game, it is also changing the way recreational boaters pursue their pastime. With dozens of boating-related Web sites offering everything from racing news and bulletin boards to feature stories and e-commerce, it is now possible to enjoy a satisfying maritime experience without going anywhere near the water.</p>
        <p>For the entrepreneurs and investors behind the Internet's largest marine Web sites, the course ahead forges through uncharted seas. Three of the sport's most ambitious entities -- Quokka.com, SailNet.com and Boats.com, which was launched just two weeks ago -- have spent millions of dollars building and staffing their respective sites.</p>
        <p>Quokka Sports, based in San Francisco, burst onto the sailing scene in 1997 with innovative Internet coverage of the Whitbread Round-the-World Race, which attracted nearly two million visitors. Quokka has since gone on to cover other sports, as well as yachting events like the America's Cup and the BT Global Challenge (btchallenge.com), a race made up of amateur sailors who pay to compete. Leg 1 of the BT race, bound for Boston, begins today from Southampton, England.</p>
        <p>''We've looked at the Internet as a medium and see ourselves as a media company creating programming,'' said Susan Daly, a Quokka vice president, who added that the company's principal source of revenue was securing sponsorship arrangements with technology firms like General Electric and Compaq.</p>
        <p>Essentially, the business plan behind SailNet.com and Boats.com is to attract viewers with technical advice and information, boat and product reviews, and features, and then to entice them to buy equipment or services like boat financing or insurance. The two companies differ somewhat in how they strive to fulfill those orders.</p>
        <p>For customers of SailNet, which is based in Mount Pleasant, S.C., the site is a full-service chandlery of marine goods that includes its own in-house sail loft and rigging shop. Earlier this year, the SailNet founders Sam and Cheryl Boyle, who employ more than 200 workers, acquired JSI, a Florida-based manufacturing and distribution center, which has become the fulfillment arm of their operation.</p>
        <p>The Boyles, who have raised $6 million in investment backing, addressed the powerboat side of the market in July when they forged a merger with Boatscape.com, a former competitor from Boston. Boatscape will remain an independent Web site under the SailNet umbrella.</p>
        <p>E-commerce is also central to the plans of Boats.com, which has a 70-employee staff and is also centered in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>''The marine industry is ready to benefit from an online marketplace,'' said Rolando Esteverena, the company's chief executive officer and Silicon Valley veteran, shortly after securing $21 million from marine industry supporters and venture capital investors last August.</p>
        <p>Unlike SailNet, Boats.com -- which has a home page that includes separate links for sailing, powerboating and fishing -- does not own a separate retail division. Instead, Boats.com views itself as an online hub where yacht brokers, boat dealers, marinas, sailmakers and other marine service businesses can participate in an open marketplace.</p>
        <p>To that end, Boats.com has received exclusive, and somewhat controversial, endorsements from the National Marine Manufacturers Association and the Marine Retailers Association of America. Critics of the arrangement say that trade associations should remain neutral. Esteverena disagrees.</p>
        <p>Sailors like Giovanni Soldini do not trouble themselves with the Web vagaries; the Internet is simply a place to find worthwhile information. Companies like SailNet and Boats.com are betting the house that, next time he needs a pair of sailing shoes or anything else nautical, he will also come clicking their way.</p>
        <p>MAKING WAVES</p>
        <p>This weekend, to commemorate the coming 50th anniversary of the Sunfish, the 13-foot-7-inch boat's current builder, Vanguard Sailboats, staged a Sunfish celebration on Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay. Vanguard has created a limited edition Sunfish to honor the milestone.</p>
