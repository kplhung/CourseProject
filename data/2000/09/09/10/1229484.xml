        <p>''For Krone and Fatherland'' scream the giant posters at the annual congress of the nationalist Danish People's Party, exhorting Danes to defend their currency and their very nationhood.</p>
        <p>Denmark at risk? With its fat cows and flaky pastries, its neat streets and nice queen, this pampered little land seems as foreign to angst as any country could be. But appearances deceive, for Denmark has an acute case of the identity crisis now afflicting several European states.</p>
        <p>The immediate threat to Denmark, as perceived by Pia Kjaersgaard, the successful leader of the People's Party, is a referendum on Sept. 28 when Danes will be asked whether they wish to preserve the krone or follow 12 other states of the 15-member European Union in abandoning their money for a shared currency, the euro.</p>
        <p>''The essential issue is the preservation of our sovereignty,'' said Ms. Kjaersgaard, who founded her party in 1995 and has seen its support grow to more than 10 percent of the electorate. ''The euro will erode our national authority and identity at a time when Denmark is already becoming more and more multiethnic and globalized.''</p>
        <p>To lump the euro with the arrival of foreigners and the effects of global competition and conjure a three-pronged menace may seem bizarre. But not necessarily in today's Europe, where concern about the dilution of nationhood through European integration and mounting immigration is widespread.</p>
        <p>Certainly, Ms. Kjaersgaard's message has struck a chord. Opinion polls suggest a virtual dead heat, with 48 percent of Danes for the euro, 46 percent against and 6 percent undecided. ''I still hope we will get the euro,'' said Marianne Jelved, the economics minister. ''But I cannot say I am confident, because the risk is there.''</p>
        <p>Not only to Denmark. This is a country of just 5.3 million inhabitants, ''a mere tail to the German bulldog,'' in the words of Ole Krarup, a law professor. But it has a special capacity for clarifying the continent's mood because it is the only country that votes regularly on how far Europe should integrate. A ''No'' vote could snowball.</p>
        <p>At the very least, it would further undermine the euro, whose value against the dollar has plunged 25 percent in a year; delay any possibility of Britain and Sweden joining the common currency; and turn Ms. Kjaersgaard into a sort of Nordic version of Austria's Jorg Haider, with an invigorated anti-European and anti-immigrant message.</p>
        <p>It might also expose the seemingly undemocratic nature of the mainly German and French drive to create a federation resembling a United States of Europe. Germans, for one, have never voted on such an idea, or on the euro itself.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that rejection of the euro would give Ms. Kjaersgaard an added hubris,'' said Jorn Thulstrup, a pollster and political analyst. ''She'd be wheeled out across the continent to say more European Union equals more control of small countries by big ones and more open borders to allow the immigrant hordes in.''</p>
        <p>In Europe, identity politics are resurgent. Nationalist, anti-immigrant parties thrive in Belgium and Austria. In Athens, Greek identity is said by the Orthodox Church to be under threat from a government plan to remove mention of religious affiliation from identification cards.</p>
        <p>In Germany, Gunter Verheugen, one of the country's top officials at the European Union's headquarters in Brussels, denounces the way the euro was introduced ''over the heads of the people'' and demands a referendum on expansion of the Union because of German fears of an influx of Poles and Czechs.</p>
        <p>In Italy, the immigrants washing up from Albania and elsewhere on the country's southern shores feed the patriotic salvos of Silvio Berlusconi, whose New Right politics are once again on the rise.</p>
        <p>As for Denmark, its Hamlet syndrome -- a recurrent hesitancy over whether something is rotten in the state of Europe -- has reached a new pitch, fed by fears that Peter Skaarup, a People's Party member of Parliament, summed up as ''the growing anxiety that we won't be masters in our own house anymore.''</p>
        <p>This Danish house has shrunk a lot over the centuries; it is more of a bungalow today. Territory was lost in wars against Sweden and Germany, turning a regional power into a powerless realm. The Danes are sensitive about what they have left.</p>
        <p>''We've taken refuge in a sort of small-is-best, if-you-can't-join-them-beat-them mentality,'' explained Jakob Buksti, the transport minister and a leading member of the governing Social Democratic Party, which is campaigning for the euro.</p>
        <p>After 28 years in the European Union, Denmark is rich. It has a low unemployment rate of 5 percent, sends 66 percent of its exports to the other states of the Union, has no security concerns and would be less vulnerable to currency fluctuations and financial speculators inside Euroland than out.</p>
        <p>''It does not take too many Salomon Brothers to empty the Danish National Bank,'' said Mr. Thulstrup, the analyst. But nor, it seems, does it take too many Danes to generate a broad resistance to Europe.</p>
        <p>In 1992, the Danes rejected the Maastricht Treaty on European Union, only to accept it a year later with slight modifications. Now, there is a possibility that Denmark will reject the euro -- and by extension Europe's political integration -- as an alliance of the far right and far left backs the ''No'' campaign.</p>
        <p>On the right of this coalition sits Ms. Kjaersgaard, 53, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, diamond bracelet glittering on one wrist, dripping disapproval and distaste for what she sees as the dismantling of Denmark.</p>
        <p>''Do we want to lose control of our lives with more and more decisions made by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt or in Brussels?'' she asked. ''Do we want this multiculturalism, this multiethnicity, about which the country was never consulted? I say we don't want either.''</p>
        <p>On the alliance's left wing sit the likes of Mr. Krarup, the law professor at the University of Copenhagen, a rumpled and thoughtful socialist, distressed by what he sees as the erosion of democracy in the ''crazy push'' for a European superstate.</p>
        <p>Like many Danes, Mr. Krarup was alarmed by the European Union's imposition of sanctions on another small country, Austria, in response to the inclusion of Mr. Haider's rightist Freedom Party in government. Because the sanctions were widely seen as an infringement of democracy and sovereignty, their imposition has bolstered Danish opponents of the euro. [Other European states may lift the sanctions before the Danish vote, after a report on Friday by a panel of experts that said the sanctions are counterproductive.]</p>
        <p>But ought a man of the left share a platform with Ms. Kjaersgaard? It is very awkward, Mr. Krarup confided. But then, this is a time of ''exponential change,'' so such odd shifts of political ground could occur.</p>
        <p>Certainly, Denmark's newspapers suggest a time of transition. They carry reports of immigrant crime and schools disrupted by ''second-generation immigrants'' -- the children of Turks, Pakistanis and others who came to work here in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>In political circles, the immigrants causing such trouble are now politely referred to as Ny Danskere -- New Danes. But the term is problematic. Are the light-skinned then ''Old Danes?'' What distinguishes the two? ''People often say 'New Danes' because they don't want to say 'Not Danes,' '' Mr. Buksti joked.</p>
        <p>Joking aside, Denmark, like other European states, has gotten itself in a tangle over immigration, and because both foreigners and the euro are seen by many to subtract from Denmark, both are in the snarl.</p>
        <p>For many years, in the charitable spirit of its traditional Social Democratic outlook, Denmark welcomed foreigners; it handed them welfare. The number of immigrants -- with papers or awaiting them -- has risen steadily to 7.1 percent of the population, from 6.6 percent in 1998.</p>
        <p>''We have been a kind of giant, philanthropic buffet table, inviting immigrants to come and help themselves,'' said Lene Espersen, a conservative politician who backs the euro but fears that ''the nightmare of a takeover'' is playing into the hands of the anti-euro campaign.</p>
        <p>Lusin Canacki, 33, a social worker in Arhus, a Danish-speaking Turk, is alarmed by the way the country has changed. She has been in Denmark since she was 6, has two children who are Danish citizens and is applying for citizenship herself. But the country she would make hers is becoming hostile, she feels.</p>
        <p>Today, she believes, Denmark is divided into ''us'' and ''them.'' ''We are told to get an education, learn the language, learn Danish habits,'' she said. ''But when we do, we are still one of 'them.' ''</p>
        <p>She continued: ''People I know come up to me and say, 'It's not people like you, Lusin, that are a problem, it's all the others.' But politicians and newspapers don't say 'Except Lusin.' We're all lumped together.''</p>
        <p>So strong has the Danish reaction against immigration been that the government of Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen recently enacted legislation that may make Denmark less attractive to foreigners. Among the laws was one barring any immigrants under age 25 from bringing a foreign spouse to Denmark. It was presented as an attempt to foster integration -- by hindering arranged marriages between young Turkish men or women in Denmark and people in Turkey, where the government says about 90 percent of Danish Turks find their partner.</p>
        <p>Other measures made some welfare dependent on learning Danish and put new pressure on immigrants to place young children in kindergartens that charge fees. ''Our priority was to prevent the spread of immigrant ghettos, the source of these immigrant gangs,'' said Pernille Blach Hansen, a Social Demorat.</p>
        <p>But that was not how Suhail Ibrahim, a 37-year-old Dane born in Lebanon, saw the laws. After more than a decade as a Social Democrat -- he arrived in Denmark from Beirut in 1986 -- Mr. Ibrahim quit the party this year, saying that it was ''on the way to becoming a racist party.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ibrahim, a Palestinian refugee, got his first passport from Denmark, in 1994. But he said he no longer feels Danish, despite a Danish wife and Danish children. ''Danes talk of integration and then devise new forms of pressure,'' he argued.</p>
        <p>So, in June, Mr. Ibrahim founded Denmark's first immigrant party, to wage a battle for the rights of foreigners. Ms. Canacki sees the idea as a disaster, ''the beginning of war, and more and more separation.''</p>
        <p>The two immigrants do not agree about the euro either. Mr. Ibrahim opposes it as a first step toward possibly severe pan-European legislation on immigration. Ms. Canacki favors the euro, because ''we foreigners cannot afford a little Denmark, closing to the world.''</p>
        <p>The government agrees with Ms. Canacki; it wants the euro badly. The Economics Ministry has rushed out a publication showing that Queen Margarethe, much beloved, will appear on one side of Danish euro coins (the coins are to have differing national symbols; all euro notes will be the same). ''The sight of the queen on the coin,'' said Ms. Jelved, the economics minister, ''helps calm fears about loss of identity.''</p>
