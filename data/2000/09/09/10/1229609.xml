        <p>VISITORS to Toronto who are interested in tasting authentic Canadian cuisine may find the search like rummaging through the clothes dryer for a missing sock -- you know it has to be there, but it isn't in the obvious places. Aside from an occasional caribou steak or maple-cured salmon, many leading Canadian chefs, at least in Ontario, point their antennae south, toward trend-setting cities in the United States and beyond. The result is a roster of restaurants that turns out eclectic, international fare, and more ''fusion'' than an auto welding shop.</p>
        <p>''Toronto is just waking up in terms of being a world-class food city,'' said Michael Rubino, co-owner with his brother, Guy, of Zoom, one of the city's most innovative dining spots. ''We use Canadian ingredients as much as possible, but in contemporary ways.'' Top-tier restaurants in Toronto can be as expensive as their counterparts in New York City; the happy difference, however, is an exchange rate of $1.50 Canadian to the United States dollar, making even top-flight dining a bargain.</p>
        <p>Zoom</p>
        <p>As is often the case with tourists in unfamiliar cities, I came upon one of the most compelling restaurants by chance, when my friend Amy happened to spot a small metal logo on the ground floor of an office building.</p>
        <p>At first glance, three-year-old Zoom appears to be little more than a rakish bar and cafe. It's an airy two-level expanse with a 20-foot-high ceiling and angular metal railings  softened by upholstered blue love seats; dangling overhead are some scary-looking illuminated globes with protruding spikes.</p>
        <p>The locally trained chef, Lorenzo Loseto, has a deft touch for melding uncommon flavors. This was evident in the first dish sampled, tuna sashimi, which in lesser hands can be a cliche. This molded tuna sat atop lightly smoked tofu, energized by pickled red onions and a saline salmon roe salsa. Another exceptional starter was roasted Canadian foie gras -- it holds its own against the French and American product -- perfectly charred and set over a smoked corn beignet and a sweet-tart red currant reduction -- and just for good measure, a fried quail egg on the side.</p>
        <p>Among the best main courses were a charred wild salmon filet served on chanterelle pearl-shaped pasta called pastini with a jasmine tea and soy glaze. On other nights  the same salmon is swathed in a cilantro mixture with a saffron-mustard sauce.</p>
        <p>Service at Zoom is smart and informed, and the international wine selection, while limited, is well chosen and fairly priced. We were curious about Canadian wines, although they tend to be expensive, so we tried a surprising 1998 gewurztraminer, from the Henry of Pelham winery in Ontario ($30), bright and rich with fruit.</p>
        <p>The Fifth</p>
        <p>Depending on your mood, this fashionable loft restaurant near the city's commercial district is the ultimate in urban cool, or a contrived annoyance. To get to the dining room you walk down a shadowy alley and confront a trio of fleshy guys dressed in black (of course) standing behind a velvet rope. After your reservation is confirmed,  you are then ushered into a converted loading dock by another fellow who looks like a very efficient bouncer. Once you reach this privileged location, another attendant wearing a headset microphone -- for what purpose I can't imagine -- leads you into a freight elevator that deposits you in a pulsing nightclub. Just as you are about to call off the practical joke, a door swings open and voila: a jazzy restaurant with brick walls, a fireplace, a long swanky bar and cushy sofas.</p>
        <p>All of this tomfoolery belies some impressively creative and well-disciplined cooking.  A good starter is the chilled fennel-and-celeriac soup with a superfluous plop of lime-basil sorbet in the middle. The celeriac imparts a clean, sharp edge. The chef's fanciful take on salade Nicoise includes salmon, monkfish and trout along with tomatoes and the ever-popular -- in Toronto, at least -- quail eggs. One of the better main courses is a large open ravioli stuffed with little langoustines awash in a heady truffle-scented shellfish stock. Cornish hen is delectable, too, with its crunchy cornmeal-crusted skin and a vinegary diable sauce, all with a mound of wild mushrooms smoky with chunks of slab bacon. For dessert you can go with a selection of French cheeses or one of the straightforward sweets like the mixed fruit tart.</p>
        <p>In most of the Toronto restaurants I visited, the pacing of the meal was finger-thrummingly slow, at least by a New Yorker's clock. You can't always blame the servers, though; more often it is delays in the kitchen. Nonetheless, The Fifth is so diverting that we didn't mind, but if you are on a timetable, make sure you speak up at the outset. And don't get lost in the dark disco on the way down.</p>
        <p>The restaurant is open on Thursday, Friday and Saturday for dinner. Technically a private club, The Fifth charges nonmembers $6.65 extra on the dining tab.</p>
        <p>Rodney's Oyster House</p>
        <p>If I were to return to Toronto, the first place I would go is Rodney's Oyster House for a pint of local brew, a shimmering platter of Nova Scotia oysters and a bowl of mussel chowder. Rodney's is a sort of convivial pub, with a long dining bar on one side, wooden booths on the other, and crustaceous specimens all over the walls (the entrance, in an office building, is easy to miss).</p>
        <p>We started with two local beers, the creamy Rodney's Oyster Stout, which, oddly enough, is brewed with some liquor of Malpeque oysters from Prince Edward Island ($3.25 a pint). Or try the faintly sweet Gritstone Brown Ale. We split a superb sampler of Canadian oysters including Malpeques from Prince Edward Island, as briny as a faceful of ocean foam. Rodney's carries some surprisingly good and easy-drinking local wines that stand up to shellfish, like the light-bodied Cave Spring Chardonnay ($19.75).</p>
        <p>For the next round we ordered a brimming bowl of mussel chowder, which was not as thick as a traditional chowder but intensely flavorful.  Oyster chowder (called slapjack chowder) is generous, too, although ours needed a hit of salt. We moved on to a spectacularly fresh dish of scallops from the Bay of Fundy, exquisitely sweet and buttery, with a wonderful fricassee of chanterelles and oyster mushrooms.</p>
        <p>No matter how much you have eaten, don't miss the hot-smoked chum salmon that is cured with maple syrup (it goes by the name Hida Indian Candy). Unlike traditional smoked salmon, this is dense and firm, with a mildly sweet flavor offset by a coating of coarsely ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>Canoe</p>
        <p>Towering 54 stories atop the downtown Toronto Dominion Center, Canoe is one of the few restaurants in the city that emphasizes Canadian products. Loin of Yukon caribou with Quebec foie gras was excellent: the meat deep red, fine grained and as tender as pork; the foie gras adding a welcome boost of richness. Also good was the tenderloin of Alberta beef with a savory truffle bread pudding that was as light as a souffle. For starters you might try the seared big-eye tuna with a fennel avocado salad.</p>
        <p>Canoe's wine list is heavy on big guns from Bordeaux and California; a more adventuresome route would be a few of the surprisingly well-made local selections, like the bright and mildly spicy 1997 Cave Spring gewurztraminer from Ontario ($26.65); among the red wines, we enjoyed another Ontario option, the 1998 13th Street gamy noir, from Sandstone Vineyard, a fruity and fresh wine that is comparable to a Beaujolais-Villages ($33.35).</p>
        <p>Canoe's rather corporate looking dining room is wrapped in floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the whole city and the lake beyond; unaccountably, though, bright reflective ceiling lights and candles on the tables make it impossible to see anything unless you press your face against the glass.</p>
        <p>Centro</p>
        <p>It's a bit of a hike out to another well-regarded restaurant (about $8 by cab), but at least you get to see some of the city's residential neighborhoods along the way. A big, brassy spot, Centro uses lots of leather and wood in its dining room, with giant color photos of Northern Italy on the walls.</p>
        <p>The expansive menu also carries  home-grown provender like Dungeness crab from British Columbia, ostrich from Prince Edward Island and smoked scallops from the Bay of Fundy. Happily, the chef lets great ingredients speak for themselves, as in the appetizer of buttery smoked scallops with a subtle beet oil vinaigrette. The same applies to North Atlantic roasted halibut atop an artichoke and beet salad. The only disappointment was a flossy preparation of Dungeness crab and sea scallops in a bland seafood emulsion.</p>
        <p>Our waiter was pleasant enough and knew his stuff, yet again the pace of the meal was leisurely at best. When dessert finally came around,  we couldn't face a rich confection or yet another variation on creme brulee; Amy ordered some refreshing fruit sorbets, and I abstained.</p>
        <p>Centro's wine selection is among the best in town, with an extensive cellar of mostly expensive California chardonnays, French Bordeaux and Tuscan reds. We went instead with the wonderfully citric 1999 sauvignon blanc from Oyster Bay vineyards in New Zealand ($28.65).</p>
