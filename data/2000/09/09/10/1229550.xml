        <p>If bars were to be classified on a scale from restful to raucous, the Fifth-Floor watering hole at Harvey Nichols, the upscale department store in London's Knightsbridge, would probably rate something like: not for the faint-hearted.</p>
        <p>With its traditional horse-shoe layout (complete with foot rail and bar stools) and a generous scattering of other seating, this is a spot not only for drinking but also for people watching. Many among the clientele would look at home as extras in ''Four Weddings and a Funeral.''</p>
        <p>And fans of the British television series ''Absolutely Fabulous'' might expect Patsy and Edina, the two fashion-driven shopaholics, to enter the bar at any moment, laden with the fruits of their retail therapy from the four floors of high-end spending opportunities below.</p>
        <p>In truth, the Fifth Floor (served by an express elevator from the entrance opposite the Knightsbridge subway station for those who want to avoid the temptation of the store itself) offers more than just the bar: a food hall, a sushi bar, a cafe and a restaurant. But it is the roomy, if invariably packed, bar, with its views out over Knightsbridge for those able to grab window seating, where a variety of accents mingle in the general cacophony -- from estuary English, the dominant accent of southeast England, to the Sloane Ranger drawl of would-be aristocrats, to American to Middle Eastern.</p>
        <p>The bar's reputation is slightly risque, it has to be said. Many orders of Champagne and wine seem to be by the bottle, rather than by more demure measures. But if shopping is something that drives you to drink, this place -- at an appropriate price (Scotch and soda: about $9) -- offers equal access to both.</p>
