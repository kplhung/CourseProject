      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>As an ensign aboard the United States Navy supply ship Pollux (and sailing regularly to and from Manila, Cebu, Taiwan and Borneo), I had the distinction of being ordered to form a squad of heavily armed boatswain and gunners' mates to fight pirates. I still remember our training program, which started with the shrill of the boatswain's pipe and the announcement, ''This is a drill: now prepare to repel boarders, starboard side.'' Happily, we were never called upon to perform other than a drill.</p>
        <p>Over the years, when telling sea stories with other former Navy personnel and remembering this experience as a pirate fighter, I always wondered if there really were pirates in the South China Sea. Well, I have my answer.</p>
