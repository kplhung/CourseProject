        <p>ALTHOUGH these are probably the last days of the Cos Cob Power Plant in Greenwich, the 1907 plant that provided power to the trains that took generations of commuters into Manhattan, a band of residents have mounted a last-ditch effort to save the historic building.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the building were able to get enough signatures on a petition to put the issue on the agenda of the Representative Town Meeting, the town's legislative body, at its meeting on Sept. 18. Still, they face a difficult task. Not only is the site on one of the last developable waterfront tracts in Greenwich, but demolition of the plant has already started. Marcus Madrid, the Greenwich Public Works director, said most residents don't seem too concerned.</p>
        <p>''We've received extremely few phone calls to stop this project,'' said Mr. Madrid. ''There isn't a ground swell of support to help it. Most people see it as a financial burden.''</p>
        <p>Debate over what to do with the power plant has embroiled residents, officials and preservationists since the city purchased the site for $1 in 1988, shortly before it ceased operations. The purchase carried the proviso that the town dedicate 25 percent of the more than eight-acre site for affordable housing, and the rest for passive recreation and open space.</p>
        <p>The site was the first plant in the nation to provide power to trains, in the days when railroads were switching from coal power to electricity. The main building was designed in  Spanish Mission style with arched doorways and windows. Some of the equipment that provided the power were such engineering marvels that they are at the Smithsonian Institution. The plant is also on the National and State Register of Historical Places and has been declared a National Historic Engineering Landmark.</p>
        <p>''The Cos Cob Power Plant has many great, vaulted spaces, like the old Penn Station and Grand Central Station, but instead of being designed to move people through, it was designed for mechanical purposes,'' said Peter Alexander, chairman of the Greenwich Historic District Commission. ''It was an enormous, wonderful space, and I thought the building should stand.''</p>
        <p>Depending on who's talking, residents and officials alternately regard the power plant as everything from an environmental nightmare to an attractive nuisance, an obsolete industrial site with a useful purpose  long since passed, to an irreplaceable monument to industry and technology.</p>
        <p>The debate has come to a head as asbestos removal has begun, and part of the main centerpiece building, along with other secondary structures, has been knocked down. Total demolition could occur before the end of the month.</p>
        <p>The First Selectman, Lolly Prince, said her administration is carrying out a federal Environmental Protection Agency directive to rid the site of asbestos and whatever other cleanup may be necessary, with $2.6 million paid by the Town of Greenwich, with Representative Town Meeting approval, and the state. ''The Cos Cob Power Plant is just about down,'' Ms. Prince said. ''We've already taken out more than 11,000 tons of asbestos in accordance with federal, state and local approvals, and we're proceeding with the cleanup. The state paid half, and we paid half. After the building comes down, we'll be doing studies of the soil to see what further remediation needs to be done.''</p>
        <p>No one argues the necessity of removing the asbestos, which riddled the building. Where some town officials and preservationists part company concerns what to do with the main building once the asbestos is gone.</p>
        <p>Paula Corrado, a former member of the Representative Town Meeting, voted last year with the majority of the 230-member body in favor of paying for the asbestos removal. R.T.M. members were also told the power plant had friable asbestos that threatened the lives of people who lived nearby and was an environmental disaster waiting to happen, she said.</p>
        <p>''The R.T.M. members can only vote based on what they are told, and I don't believe the information we were given was the right information,'' she said. ''We were told the building had to come down, that people's lives were in danger.</p>
        <p>''Why did it take 12 years with no maintenance for the asbestos to become airborne, before anyone did anything about it?'' she asked. ''The people have been misled by town officials about the necessity of razing the whole building, when all that was needed was to rid it of asbestos.''</p>
        <p>Karen Kinley Bruno, a resident of Greenwich, became involved in the issue in July. She placed a full-page advertisement, at her own expense, in a local newspaper urging that the building be saved, and she has written to President Clinton, urging him to help save it.</p>
        <p>''The Cos Cob Power Plant was critical to the New York, New Haven and the Hartford Railroad Company, providing a vital economic benefit for New York City,'' she said. ''On an engineering and pioneering level, it is considered an engineering marvel, since it represented a unique source of power, like Hoover Dam.''</p>
        <p>Since Ms. Bruno has become involved in trying to save the plant, she has been cited by the police for trespassing on the site four times and ordered by the first selectman's office to dismantle a display of antique toys she arranged in a showcase at Town Hall to symbolize the power plant issue.</p>
        <p>Laura Dickey, another lifelong Greenwich resident, also said the building should be saved.</p>
        <p>''This facility was built to last,'' she said. ''I'm not a major activist. I haven't been involved in a bunch of cases, but I have to speak up about this.'' She mentioned the elegant windows of the main, centerpiece building, and noted how it could have been reused as an amphitheater, museum, or skate park.</p>
        <p>''Most people never knew about all the reuse concepts proposed by various architectural firms,'' she said. ''If they had, they might have had a very different feeling about what is going on.''</p>
        <p>Richard Halloran, an R.T.M. member who has studied plans by architectural firms on how to reuse the plant, such as for a museum, apartments or a park, said he would keep an open mind and listen to what Ms. Bruno and others have to say at the meeting.</p>
        <p>A series of first selectmen who preceded Ms. Prince engaged in extensive debate about what to do with the property. No one knows better the extent of those debates than John W. Shannahan, commissioner of the State Historical District Commission in Hartford. In fact, Mr. Shannahan said the commission has engaged in more discussion over the future of the Cos Cob power plant than any other historic structure during his entire tenure at the commission, dating to 1969.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shannahan said town officials have wanted to tear it down right from the beginning, although the former First Selectman John B. Margenot Jr. supported a compromise plan in 1995. No action was taken.</p>
        <p>''The town never really appreciated the historical importance of an industrial site like this, which by its nature is dirty and sooty,'' Mr. Shannahan said. ''This has always been a public relations problem. The town never wanted to see the power plant left standing. It's a shame if its memory and significance can't be preserved. Somehow the city and country ought to memorialize the historical part the power plant played.''</p>
        <p>Since the original purchase, town officials have requested a change in state legislation, permitting construction of a commensurate number of affordable housing units within city limits, but allowing the Cos Cob Power Plant site to be used for open space and passive recreation only. That legislation is still pending, Mr. Madrid said.</p>
        <p>Demolition of the building is necessary to remove all the asbestos, he said, because the building was constructed around the turbines and other power equipment. Asbestos is interspersed among both the structure and the equipment, he said. Mr. Madrid also argued that the demolition is necessary, based on the building's deteriorating condition. But he did suggest retaining 11 historically significant relics from the power plant, like the Westinghouse Parsons turbine generator.</p>
        <p>''Our vision is to construct some kind of pavilion once the building is gone,'' Mr. Madrid said. ''I'm an engineer and very interested in the first electrified railroad in the United States. Hopefully, we'll do it justice.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Madrid was asked about dismantling the plant in light of its placement on the National Register of Historical Places and other historical registers, he said the law allows demolition of some historic structures if their preservation isn't economically feasible. ''Not all historic structures can be preserved and kept,'' he said.</p>
