        <p>Ricardo Khan's return to Crossroads Theater Company in New Brunswick in July created a buzz about a theater in crisis.</p>
        <p>In January, Mr. Khan, the company's artistic head, began a one-year sabbatical in Trinidad, with Harold Scott taking charge in his absence. But Mr. Scott had departed before the season ended. At that time, the theater's uncertain artistic vision, administrative disorganization and the pressure of creditors at the door raised doubts about a new season.</p>
        <p>''I'm back not to run the theater but to help heal it,'' Mr. Khan said last month, putting to rest speculation that he was to take over his old job. He said he would devote his time to preparing for a major campaign to build an endowment. The theater's deficit was then estimated to be in excess of $1.2 million, with an additional $300,000 needed to replenish its cash reserves.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, a new artistic director had not yet been named. When Mr. Khan was asked about the season's repertory, he emphasized that he was not involved with that process but felt ''certain there will be a full season, but with a delayed opening.''</p>
        <p>About Crossroads, he said: ''I tried to be responsible for everything. Now a transition is needed to the right team that makes sure the business end is in shape.''</p>
        <p>What then is Mr. Khan's new title? ''Ill always be co-founder,'' he said. ''Now I want to be a friend.''</p>
