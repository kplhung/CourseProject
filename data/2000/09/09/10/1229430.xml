        <p>I moved to Brooklyn 15 years ago and have since spent several mornings each week walking, running or just greeting the day in Prospect Park. In recent years, these tranquil mornings have been too often disrupted by snarling dogs who are permitted off their leashes in the early morning during what the park system refers to as ''courtesy hours.'' In the last year alone, I have been cornered four times by ill-behaved dogs -- two of them pit bulls -- who were clearly unfit to run loose in a public park.</p>

The owner of a big, menacing boxer promised to kill me when I told him I would mace the dog if it charged me again.

        <p>I moved to Brooklyn 15 years ago and have since spent several mornings each week walking, running or just greeting the day in Prospect Park. In recent years, these tranquil mornings have been too often disrupted by snarling dogs who are permitted off their leashes in the early morning during what the park system refers to as ''courtesy hours.'' In the last year alone, I have been cornered four times by ill-behaved dogs -- two of them pit bulls -- who were clearly unfit to run loose in a public park.</p>
        <p>The owners of such dogs rarely apologize and sometimes behave as belligerently as their animals. The owner of a big, menacing boxer promised to kill me when I told him I would mace the dog if it charged me again. A few weeks later, the owner of a frothing German shepherd declined to leash his dog -- essentially using it to corner me, while he advised me to stay home during ''courtesy hours'' and lectured me on the dog's right to be free.</p>
        <p>Dog groups in Brooklyn and elsewhere are fighting to head off new dog regulations and to preserve the privileges they now enjoy in the public parks. But those privileges will remain at risk unless the owners can learn to balance the needs of their animals with the needs of the human beings with whom they share New York City's public spaces.</p>
        <p>Animal welfare officials estimate that there are a million dogs in the city -- or roughly one canine for every eight human beings. The number of dogs will continue to grow, thanks to new federal regulations that allow the 430,000 people who live in New York City public housing to own dogs. In 1998, the chairman of the New York City Housing Authority tried to block the measure, arguing that public housing's dog problem was already out of control, even with rules that limited dog ownership to the elderly and the disabled.</p>
        <p>Over the last 10 years, the number of dog bites reported to the City Health Department has ranged from 6,000 to nearly 11,000 a year. The number of biting dogs taken into custody by animal care officials grew by nearly a third between 1996 and 1999, as more and more New Yorkers who were ill prepared to train and handle such dogs acquired them anyway. Testifying before the City Council last year, the city's health commissioner, Dr. Neal Cohen, concluded that New York had ''failed to adequately protect the public from biting dogs.'' Dr. Cohen supported a Giuliani administration bill that would have required liability insurance for pit bulls -- which are responsible for about a third of all bites in the city -- and made it easier for the city to confiscate vicious and biting dogs generally. Dog groups have blocked the bill.</p>
        <p>The practice of allowing dogs to run free in city parks during the early morning and late evening evolved informally during the 1970's and 80's, when the parks were suffering from neglect and dog owners felt safer than other people about entering the overgrown, crime-ridden spaces. The ''courtesy hours'' continued after the parks were cleaned up and patrons returned. But the last few years have seen considerable friction between dog owners and park visitors who want to picnic, sunbathe or exercise without being set upon by wayward animals.</p>
        <p>With too few park officers to cover all the boroughs, city park authorities rely on loosely organized groups of dog owners who use peer pressure to bring owners into line. Conscientious dog owners routinely chase down others who break park rules and fail to clean up after their dogs. But, fearing that poorly behaved dogs will be euthanized, dog owners sometimes suppress news of even serious maulings that should be reported to the police.</p>
        <p>In September 1999, a Brooklyn woman named Sarah Lowe was badly bitten by a dog that was part pit bull and roaming off its leash in Prospect Park. The dog clamped down so fiercely that it fractured Ms. Lowe's wrist. After six months of physical therapy, Ms. Lowe may yet require surgery to correct the damage.</p>
        <p>A dog that breaks the bones of an adult could kill a small child. But instead of filing a police complaint right away, Ms. Lowe says she negotiated with the dog's owner, who agreed to muzzle the dog. Ms. Lowe waited two months before she reported the attack to the police -- and said she did so only after finding that the dog had bitten someone else and was still roaming the park unmuzzled.</p>
        <p>The dog that bit Ms. Lowe is listed in the police report as a pit bull mix named Ozzie. But as recently as two weeks ago, I encountered this dog bounding through the park playing fetch, as wary walkers moved aside. A man walking his own dog warned: ''Keep out of his way. That is one dangerous animal.''</p>
        <p>The police and the health department hold the ultimate responsibility for controlling dogs proved to be vicious. But if owners wish to keep their privileges in the parks, they will need to show as much concern for public comfort and safety as for the rights of their animals.</p>
