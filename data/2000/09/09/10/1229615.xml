        <p>OKWUI ENWEZOR  Artistic director, Documenta XI; adjunct curator, Art Institute of Chicago</p>
        <p>WHEREVER I go I have been establishing contacts with people, lately especially in the area of film, so I am looking forward to the film festival in Tehran this February. It's an independent festival, although one never knows exactly how independent, primarily geared toward productions from the Middle East and the Asian subcontinent. Also the Havana Bienal -- it's always exciting to be in Havana, both for the city and to see the other approaches there to how people are working. There is also a retrospective of Isaac Julien's films at Bard College that I'm interested in and a Raymond Pettibone show that will be at Regen Projects in Los Angeles. And finally, there's one work that is not yet public that I have been following closely. Rem Koolhaas has been working on a project involving an investigation of Lagos, Nigeria. I was in Rotterdam and saw some interesting material. He's doing a book and an exhibition related to this.</p>

        <p>GARY GARRELS  Chief curator, department of prints and drawings and curator of painting and sculpture, the Museum of Modern Art, New York</p>
        <p>THERE are two biennials I'm hoping to get to -- Havana, in November, which is one of the primary places for exchange with Latin American artists and professionals, and Venice, where I'm keen to see what Robert Gober is going to do. Another thing I'm very excited about is a small, focused show on late Mondrian at the Busch-Reisinger at Harvard next spring. It's looking at the paintings that mark the transition between Europe and America, and I'm always interested in how artists continue to reinvent their vocabulary over a sustained career. There's the H. C. Westermann retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. Westermann is one of those fascinating figures from outside the mainstream -- the work is idiosyncratic, personal and brilliant -- and a show like this is long overdue. Then there is the Correggio and Parmigianino show at the Met. It's consummate, bravura draftsmanship, and I think this kind of high mannerism has perfect timeliness in the context of the current generation of painters who are dealing with figuration -- not a straight realistic figuration, but an expressive figuration.</p>
        <p>BICE CURIGER  Editor, Parkett; curator, Kunsthaus Zurich</p>
        <p>I HAVE always been really interested in Alice Neel, whose survey travels after the Whitney. The presence she gets for her subjects, through a very eccentric painting style, is terrific. It's also fascinating that she did that in America during a time when the ideology of abstract art was so strong. In a way, I am more interested in her than I am in Lucian Freud. Also John Wesley at P.S. 1 -- his insistence on erotic content and reduction in colors and forms; he's working within a very specific painterly tradition that appeals to me as a European. Then there is Bridget Riley at Dia. I'm interested in why these kinds of optical sensations bother your perception in a way that almost seems psychological, the way they attack the mind. Somehow artists of the last few decades have seen Op Art as a dead end, yet I think Riley makes it interesting, so perhaps such arguments were too easy.</p>
        <p>KATHY HALBREICH  Director, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis</p>
        <p>I'M interested in seeing ''01.01.01: Art in Technological Times'' at the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco. It's Benjamin Weil's show, and I'm curious to see how he addresses the connection between virtual and physical space in terms of organizing the exhibition, which is something we're all struggling with. I am really excited about the Durer show at Harvard, too. I imagine that it will be sort of like having a needle drilled through either my heart or brain, I'm not sure which.</p>
        <p>I'm also looking forward to the Paul McCarthy exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in L.A. Paul's one of the most obdurate, difficult, dense artists working today. I'm not an absolute convert, but I can't name many artists who have perplexed me for so long and kept me coming back. And Dallas is doing a Henry Moore retrospective. I think I know what I think about Henry Moore, but there have been times when I've been really surprised by him. I guess I have had this image of a kind of benevolent innovator, but occasionally I've gotten to the bony substructure where it really is a more aggressive vision than I've framed for myself. It's so easy sometimes without enough historical distance to put to rest artists who maybe we shouldn't inter so soon.</p>
        <p>LEE MINGWEI  Artist</p>
        <p>THERE'S an Andy Goldsworthy show up now at Storm King that I want to see; I've seen the work in publications but never in an exhibition setting. The Ann Wilson show is still up for a while at MOCA in Chicago, too. I started as a fiber artist before I began making conceptual work, and her weaving and textiles always have a very conceptual base. There's the big Yoko Ono retrospective coming to the Japan Society; I've read a lot about the work but haven't seen much of it, and it seems like it would probably make sense in a retrospective where one work can be connected with another. I'm interested in Wolfgang Laib at the Hirshhorn; like me, he works with the mundane, with found objects from nature. Janine Antoni is having a show, too, at the Aldrich in Connecticut. She's one of my favorites, with the way she uses such unorthodox materials. And Hiroshi Sugimoto at San Francisco MOMA; there's something about his aesthetic I identify with. People ask me why, since I'm Taiwanese, my work sometimes seems so Japanese. Of course, Taiwan was occupied by Japan for 50 years; both of my parents spoke Japanese. So, culturally speaking, in some ways I'm more Japanese than Chinese; I'm really drawn to that simple Zen aesthetic.</p>
        <p>LINDA NOCHLIN  Lila Acheson Wallace professor of modern art, New York University Institute of Fine Arts</p>
        <p>THERE'S a new Impressionism show at the National Gallery in London that I'm interested in. I think there's been so much blockbuster presentation of Impressionism, and I think this may be a more focused and scholarly and detailed view. The Charlotte Salomon show that's coming to the Jewish Museum from Boston ought to be fascinating. I got interested in her years and years ago. She kept this kind of pictorial diary in Germany in her youth, very personal; she was killed in the Holocaust. She was quite a bit older than Anne Frank and more sophisticated. The work is brilliant in its formal language, in terms of its intimacy and honesty in its depiction of herself and her family and her time. It's very moving. The Musee d'Orsay is having a show of Manet still lifes, which are absolutely superb. They're often a single isolated object; the most extraordinarily lonely still lifes imaginable. The ''Women of Russian Modernism'' show coming to the Guggenheim could be intriguing, too.  At least it will demonstrate that there was one avant-garde that featured women working, rather than just taking off their clothes and lying down.</p>
        <p>NICHOLAS PENNY  Andrew Mellon professor at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts, National Gallery of Art, Washington; curator, National Gallery, London</p>
        <p>I'M certainly interested in the show at the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh devoted to the enthusiasm for early Renaissance art on the part of Lord Lindsay. Lord Lindsay was a Scottish nobleman and intellectual who had a great passion for Christian art, what we call early Renaissance. He fascinates me because he represents the different attitude toward tastes that we now take for granted. People from Lindsay's time, the mid-19th century, looked at it in a completely different way. I mean, one had to defend loving Fra Angelico. The taste for 15th-century Italian pictures developed at the expense of 17th-century art. I might also say that I get slightly irritated with the idea that everything in the world of art consists of loan exhibitions. I'm going to the U.S. soon, and one of the great draws will be to explore American collections, particularly in the American Midwest. Everyone knows about great paintings in New York or Washington, or even Chicago, but there are also absolutely extraordinary things in places like Detroit, Kansas City and Cleveland.</p>
        <p>MARTIN PURYEAR  Artist</p>
        <p>ONE thing I'm excited about is the Tom Friedman show, which is in Chicago now. His work is obviously very different from mine, but its inventiveness and wit and obsessiveness have always struck me as interesting. The Twombly sculpture show that's going to be at the National Gallery in Washington should also be great. I've seen the work mostly in photos and a few pieces firsthand, and I think it's extraordinary. There's something about it that's almost classical: it's timeless, but it's made with materials that often feel ephemeral. It has a lightness of being, yet the forms are very grounded; it doesn't feel labored over, it's very spontaneous and poised. Also the work of Adrian Piper, whose retrospective is coming to the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, has always interested me. I like the fact that she's dealing with ethnicity and social issues, things that are visceral and socially uncomfortable, in a way that's extremely conceptual and intellectual. People are more open to this kind of work now, but a generation ago it would have been almost taboo to show it in a mainstream situation. I know a lot of people are put off by it. They see it as accusatory and assigning blame, but I guess that's a sign of a certain kind of success, too -- making people squirm.</p>
        <p>SARAH SZE  Artist</p>
        <p>I'M interested to see the William Blake show coming to the Met. The work has such an intimate narrative, like things he drew for himself that became public. You feel the sense of his own revelation in the making of the work. Also the Correggio and Parmigianino show there just seems so fitting now, given the prominence of contemporary mannerists like John Currin and Lisa Yuskavage. In terms of contemporary work, there are three shows -- Stan Douglas at Los Angeles MOCA, Andreas Gursky t New York MOMA and Sharon Lockhart at Chicago MOCA -- that I'm especially looking forward to. They are three very important photographers, and seeing all their work, a large body of it, will be very strong. There are also artists like Tom Friedman at Chicago, Udomsak Krisinamis at the Wexner and Lisa Yuskavage at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia, whose work I've seen a lot in galleries, but not in one-person museum shows. I'm interested to see how they work on that level, particularly Lisa, because there is always so much controversy around her work, its high level of confrontation and seduction. I'm also very intrigued by the show on Philip Guston at Fogg at Harvard. He's someone who took incredible risks in his career. I once read something he wrote about how when he made that change, from abstraction to those pictures that are, at least on one level, quite ugly and confrontational, all his support dropped away, but he gained all this freedom. He said, ''Creativity is based on one's ability to be embarrassed.''</p>
        <p>ARNOLD LEHMAN  Director, Brooklyn Museum of Art</p>
        <p>OFTEN I'll see things if there's a curator I admire involved, so I'm interested in Barbara Haskell's Steichen show at the Whitney. I always expect great things from Barbara, and she always delivers. Also, Peter Galassi's Andreas Gursky show at MOMA. I find Gursky's view of the world fascinating, and I think it has incredible currency. It allows in a very large audience while maintaining a very high degree of concentration for people who have a specific interest in photography. Lynne Cooke at Dia is doing a Bridget Riley show; I think Riley will be very successful with a new generation of viewers.</p>
        <p>Stephanie Barron of the Los Angeles County Museum is doing a giant exhibition of works made in California. I'm not sure what exactly is in it, but I believe it includes art, design, manufactured objects. Stephanie is a great organizer. I might also mention the Nari Ward show at the Walker. I saw a great installation of Ward's at P.S. 1. And then I understand there's going to be a show of Michelangelo drawings from the Casa Buonarroti at the High in Atlanta. Years ago I was involved with trying to put a show like this together, but it came to naught, so I'll be interested to see how it finally turned out.</p>
        <p>WYNN KRAMARSKY  Collector</p>
        <p>THE San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is doing a show with the Mr. and Ms. Harry Anderson collection. They have great graphic work, but it's a collection that also has a fabulous representation of postwar American art. When I saw it for the first time, it just blew me away. Also the Sol LeWitt show. LeWitt is the sweetest, most wonderful, most generous man in creation. The National Gallery is doing a ''10 years of collecting'' show, and it should be interesting to see what they're acquired over the years. The Wexner has Ray Johnson in September, and there's also the Henri Michaux exhibition at the Drawing Center.</p>
        <p>CAROL SQUIERS  Curator, International Center for Photography, New York</p>
        <p>I TEND to be especially interested in curators who are trying to take a new view of an old subject. If Barbara Haskell does that with her Steichen show at the Whitney, that would be excellent -- maybe something that related his commercial work to his artwork in ways we haven't seen before. I'd be fascinated to see the August Sander show at the Getty, too. I'm very interested in the whole notion of photos from the early part of the century as typological documents, and Sander certainly did that in the most elegant way possible. I would love to see him contextualized with others of his generation or maybe earlier, to see how the photos conform to or depart from certain notions of type. Then there's Andreas Gursky, too, at MOMA. I think he has managed to make spectacular photographs starting from a place that was very conceptual and static and not the most visually dynamic. Of his group, I think Gursky has been the most successful at introducing spectacle and dynamism into his pictures while still hewing his essential preoccupations.</p>
        <p>MARLA PRATHER  Curator of postwar art, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York</p>
        <p>I'M still hoping to see the Ruscha show at the Hirshhorn. He's an artist who been doing great work since the 1960's, and one always wants to see shows of artists that one has fantasized about doing shows about. A couple of the shows I'm looking forward to are in Washington, where I was living, and I want to try to see them because I don't want to become one of those New Yorkers who say they can never make it down to Washington to see things. The big one is the Art Nouveau show that's coming to the National Gallery from the Victoria and Albert. It's fin de siecle, my old interest, and it's the kind of show -- decorative art -- that the National Gallery does so well, with beautiful installations. To be honest, the show I'm probably most keen on is the Sol LeWitt show. I saw it in San Francisco and I can't wait to see how it's going to translate into our galleries at the Whitney.</p>
