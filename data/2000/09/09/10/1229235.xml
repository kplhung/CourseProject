        <p>Want to find the highest hill in Manhattan? The deepest subway station?</p>
        <p>Curious about the building where Judge Crater bought a co-op apartment shortly before he disappeared 70 years ago -- touching off one of the most enduring mysteries in New York City history?</p>
        <p>Need to know where the first Oreo cookie was baked?</p>
        <p>John Tauranac, an urban and architectural historian and map designer, has now produced a block-by-block atlas of Manhattan that offers just about all the critical information a site-seeker might need -- and then some.</p>
        <p>The atlas, about the size of a Zagat guide, provides addresses on each side of every block. Major office buildings, apartment buildings, hotels, churches, police stations and schools are identified. Museums, theaters, parks and even statues are pinpointed. Playgrounds are shown with a symbol of a child on a swing; movie theaters by an antique camera; emergency rooms by red crosses. Traffic directions are indicated, subway stops are shown and separate subway and bus maps are provided.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to show all the features, man-made and natural,'' said Mr. Tauranac, ''including things like Manhattan's highest natural point, Bennett Park'' -- 265 feet above sea level, at 185th Street and Fort Washington Avenue (Page 128). On the next page is the deepest subway station, the 191st Street stop of the 1 and 9 lines, dug 180 feet into the bedrock below St. Nicholas Avenue.</p>
        <p>The map indicates such esoteric sites as the brownstone on Fifth Avenue at 128th Street where the reclusive Collyer brothers lived -- and died (Page 116). ''Langley and Homer Collyer kept towers of newspapers, piles of junk in the apartment, an old automobile chassis in the basement,'' Mr. Tauranac said -- 120 tons in all, including 14 pianos, with booby-trapped aisles between the piles. When the police answered an anonymous call on March 21, 1947, they found Homer Collyer sitting bolt upright, but very dead. Langley Collyer's body was found two weeks later, under a collapsed mountain of debris.</p>
        <p>At 40 Fifth Avenue (Page 59) is the building into which State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Force Crater moved shortly before Aug. 6, 1930, the day he disappeared. ''He was allegedly involved in some corruption,'' Mr. Tauranac said. ''He put his papers in order, got in a cab and was never seen again.''</p>
        <p>The first Oreo cookie, by the way, was baked in 1912 at the National Biscuit Company building, now part of the Chelsea Market on Ninth Avenue at 15th Street (Page 65).</p>
        <p>Mr. Tauranac spent two years walking the streets, verifying his research and distilling snippets of obscure Manhattan lore. Why? ''Because I'm a New York crazy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The 172-page paperback, ''Manhattan Block by Block: A Street Atlas,'' published by Tauranac Maps, is available at bookstores for $14.95.</p>
