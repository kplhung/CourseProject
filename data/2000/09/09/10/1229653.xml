        <p>'Let others argue the case for the old guard,'' Al Gore said in his Los Angeles acceptance speech. ''We're the new guard.''</p>
        <p>In Michigan two days earlier, the vice president scorned ''the failed ways of the old guard,'' and one night before, his choice for vice president, Joseph Lieberman, asked the Democratic convention, ''Are we going to elect the old guard that created the problems or a new guard that will continue to work solving them?''</p>
        <p>From this we can safely assume that Democrats have formulated a rhetorical strategy to get around the In party's traditional ''time for a change'' problem. ''My goodness,'' exclaimed the CNN analyst William Schneider as the slogan was repeated, ''they've been in for eight years -- how can they be the new guard?''</p>
        <p>As the old song goes, wishing will make it so. The daring idea is to take the ''new'' out of newcomer and the ''in'' out of incumbent. How? By hanging the old guard label on the challengers, those who have been the Ins for the past two terms cast themselves as the contrasting new guard. No such audacious reversal has been suggested since Adlai Stevenson countered the charges of a ''mess in Washington'' by saying that the G.O.P. slogan in 1952 should be ''Throw the rascals in.''</p>
        <p>As the fair-minded reader will note, the scholarly function of this linguistic column during a presidential campaign is to examine, with scrupulous nonpartisanship, the roots of its catch phrases.</p>
        <p>''The Guard dies, but never surrenders'' (''La Garde meurt, mais ne se rend pas'') was supposed to have been said by Count Cambronne on June 18, 1815, rejecting the Duke of Wellington's call for Napoleon's surrender after the Battle of Waterloo. He did not say ''the old Guard''; indeed, Cambronne went to his grave denying that he ever said anything of the sort, which was one of the last times anybody denied making a historic utterance. (I erred recently in attributing the wrong gender to La Garde. J'en suis desole.)</p>
        <p>Others suggested that the count had said, simply and forcefully, merde! -- an expletive of excrement, which sounds like meurt, the French for ''dies.'' Gen. Anthony McAuliffe of the United States, rejecting surrender at Bastogne in the World War II Battle of the Bulge, is also suspected of having used a more forceful expression than his recorded ''Nuts!'' But I digress.</p>
        <p>Even if Cambronne did say, ''The Guard dies,'' etc., whence comes the old Guard? Evidently this was the familiar name of the Imperial Guard of Napoleon I, cited in an 1809 message to the emperor as la vieille Garde and repeated by him in his final adieu in 1814: ''Soldiers of my Old Guard: I bid you farewell.''</p>
        <p>The phrase was not extended beyond the specific Napoleonic troops until applied to ''grim sea grenadiers'' by the American novelist Herman Melville, in ''White Jacket'' in 1850, who called them ''hearty old members of the Old Guard.'' The phrase continued to have an affectionate, loyal-veteran connotation until 1880, when supporters of a third term for President Ulysses S. Grant wore medallions proclaiming ''Old Guard'' on them; Democrats reacted by using the phrase as a description of Republican reactionaries.</p>
        <p>That is the current sense. Aware of this, a conservative Republican group in the 1970's, the Young Americans for Freedom, named its publication The New Guard. But in political terminology, anything can be freely swiped. In this case, that is what the creative Gore word-slingers seeking to keep the Democrats in office have done in their coordinated effort to derogate the freshness of the Bush challenge.</p>
        <p>Class Warfare  After the Democratic presidential nominee posed the choice in the election as being between ''the people'' and ''the powerful,'' he was chastised by G.O.P. leaders as advocating class warfare.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore launched out talking about populism,'' charged Karl Rove, Governor Bush's chief campaign strategist, ''about class warfare.'' The next day, on the stump, the G.O.P. standard-bearer himself denounced his opponent as ''a candidate who wants to wage class warfare to get ahead.'' Unfortunately, much of the sting in the charge was lost because Bush was seen and heard on television pronouncing the phrase as ''class war fore,'' inviting derision.</p>
        <p>Who coined the phrase? The Oxford English Dictionary spotted a heading of class warfare in George Bernard Shaw's ''Fabian Tract 41,'' written in 1892; it was not picked up until 1927, when Aldous Huxley, in an essay in ''Proper Studies,'' wrote about ''those who would interpret all social phenomena in terms of class warfare.''</p>
        <p>However, a useful new database -- the Making of America, a joint project of Cornell and the University of Michigan -- permits detailed examination of 19th-century American texts. Assiduous research by Kathleen Miller, my departing research assistant, reveals a use of the phrase in London's Aug. 17, 1867, Spectator. The editorialist urged ''some grand effort to settle the Irish question'' and put forward a conservative idea about land reform, noting that there was ''no confiscation in this plan, no plea for raising that cry, no summons to class warfare.''</p>
        <p>From that day to this, the charge of instigating class warfare has been used as an antidote to populist ideas.</p>
        <p>Willkie Lives  After Al Gore denounced the old guard and other powerful interests, the relatively moderate Joe Lieberman was asked if the Democratic proposals would cause him to take a populist line. ''Political rallies tend not to be places for extremely thoughtful argument,'' he told The Wall Street Journal. Rather, he said that the Gore policy proposals were ''quite moderate'' and added, ''You have some rhetorical flourishes.''</p>
        <p>That reminded political-history buffs of Wendell Willkie, G.O.P. nominee in 1940 against F.D.R., who warned in the campaign that ''if the present administration is restored to power for a third term, our democratic system will not last another four years.'' After his defeat, Willkie undertook a diplomatic mission for President Roosevelt and was asked how he could square his cooperation with his earlier charges. In testifying before Congress in a way that infuriated Republicans, Willkie grinned and let the cat out of the political bag: ''It was just a bit of campaign oratory.''</p>
        <p>Today, that's called ''rhetorical flourishes.''</p>
