        <p>IN the two years since the Navy, authorized by an act of Congress, transferred ownership of its 2,900-acre Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant here on Swan Pond Road over to the town of Riverhead Community Development Agency, redevelopment has moved at a glacial pace.</p>
        <p>The 2,900-acre parcel, which includes office and manufacturing buildings, a railroad spur and two runways, had been leased for almost half a century by Grumman and its successor company, Northrop Grumman, for assembling and testing military aircraft.</p>
        <p>The military contractor moved out in 1996, eliminating 3,000 jobs and ending $1 million annual payments to Riverhead in lieu of taxes. Another financial blow to Riverhead taxpayers has been the annual cost of almost $2 million to maintain the property.</p>
        <p>From the start, the town has been looking for buyers at what is being called Enterprise Park at Calverton. A rezoning was based on a master plan that envisioned  establishing a 365-acre industrial park, retaining the larger runway for use by companies locating there, and devoting the rest of the site to sports and leisure activities along with public parks and open space.</p>
        <p>Construction of a 300-room hotel and conference center has been proposed as well as golf courses, a baseball stadium, a theme park and a car racing track, among others. But nothing has materialized except for a purchase contract for 42 acres by a water skiing club, Island Water Park, which is planning to build two 1,800-foot-long ponds for water skiing. The $750,000 deal is expected to close within 90 days.</p>
        <p>The sale of the industrial park, which has increased in size to 493 acres as planning evolved, seemed to hold more promise of a speedy conclusion -- until recently. The 493-acre core of the former military site, which includes a million square feet of buildings, is under contract to be sold for $17 million to Camelot/Calverton, an affiliate of Burman Properties, a Syosset developer. The zoning allows up to two million square feet of additional industrial space to be built on the 493 acres.</p>
        <p>The contract was signed in June 1999, and the transaction has suffered a number of delays, including disputes over the specific boundaries. Now a further snag could put off  a transfer of title for months.</p>
        <p>Under its contract, Burman must get all municipal approvals, including subdivision approval, from the town before the purchase can close. It recently applied for a six-lot subdivision with the intention of going back in the future as owner of the property and requesting an additional 40 lots.</p>
        <p>Last month, the town turned down the application on the grounds that six lots -- as opposed to four lots -- are a major subdivision and would trigger lengthy reviews from the Suffolk County Planning Commission and the county's Department of Health Services. It is arguing that the developer should apply for a subdivision of only four lots, saying this would allow the closing to take place within weeks rather than months.</p>
        <p>Customarily, when land is subdivided, a subdivision of four lots or less is referred to as a minor subdivision and as such requires less scrutiny by planning agencies and health departments than subdivisions of five lots or more.</p>
        <p>''The difference between a four-lot and a six-lot subdivision is not unimportant or insignificant because different factors would come into play, and that was not a risk contemplated by our contract,'' said Robert Kozakiewicz, Riverhead's town supervisor. ''I would like first and foremost for a closing to take place and happen, but it would be fiscally irresponsible for us to take what would be a 60-day period for a closing and to extend that into a six-month period.''</p>
        <p>Peter Pitsiokos, the lawyer representing Burman, maintains the supervisor is overstating the importance of the fact that there are six lots. He says there is a provision in Riverhead's town code that allows six lots to be treated as a minor subdivision. ''All we are doing here is taking existing buildings and putting lines between them to create separate lots, which is why we were perplexed and stunned by the rejection of our map,'' Mr. Pitsiokos said.</p>
        <p>JAN BURMAN, the president of Burman Properties, said the six-lot subdivision proposal includes four lots, totaling 90 acres and 600,000 square feet of buildings, that could be sold immediately to four buyers who have already signed purchase agreements. Those sales, he said, would bring close to $12 million and would help to offset his $17 million investment.</p>
        <p>While the sale to Burman has been pending, the town has been marketing space at Calverton Enterprise Park through the Melville office of Grubb &amp; Ellis, the real estate service concern, signing temporary license agreements with tenants until Burman takes title.</p>
        <p>The Enterprise Park offers rents and land prices that are well below those offered elsewhere, said Jack O'Connor, the Grubb &amp; Ellis executive who is in charge of leasing for the town.</p>
        <p>The industrial space is renting for $5 a square foot annually, including taxes. Vacant land is on the market for $60,000 to $75,000 an acre. One of the attractions for potential users is the park's location in a 1,248-acre Economic Development Zone. The designation gives companies there a number of advantages, including property tax abatements, reduced utility rates, sales-tax exemptions and tax credits for job creation.</p>
        <p>Four companies have moved in under the temporary lease arrangement and those tenants say they are in limbo until the sale to Burman is completed. All four have signed agreements with Burman that will allow them to purchase their buildings once Burman takes title.</p>
        <p>''I'm not here as a tenant; I'm here to purchase the property,'' said Joseph Lo Giudice, the president of Global Marine Power, a manufacturer of power boats, which in December moved into a 30,000-square-foot building once used by Northrop Grumman as a machine shop.</p>
        <p>When it moved to Calverton, the company had 30 employees. It now has 45 workers and expects growth to continue.</p>
        <p>''We were looking for a facility that we could own and that would give us growth potential,'' Mr. Lo Giudice said. ''When Jan Burman told me his plan for the property, it made sense, which is why I moved forward.''</p>
        <p>Michael Reilly, the owner of Michael Reilly Design, a manufacturer of wooden custom windows and doors and of architectural millwork, said the protracted delays of Burman's closing are ''making it very difficult for me, and I certainly would have thought much longer and harder if I had known this was going to go on.'' He occupies 75,000 square feet but has a contract to purchase 212,000 square feet in two buildings.</p>
        <p>His current space needs major renovations, Mr. Reilly said, but he is unable to make them until he owns the building. Under the license agreement with the town, which is not like a regular lease, ''all I am allowed to do is use the building,'' he said. ''If I have a leaky roof or a broken toilet, or my lights don't work, it's my problem, not the town's.''</p>
        <p>Graham Scaife, the owner of Stony Brook Manufacturing, which also moved to Calverton in December, said his business, which makes posts for highway signs and traffic signals, has already grown so quickly in its new location that he must add 3,000 square feet of office space to his 11,300-square-foot  building ''or choke.''</p>
        <p>''But I can't touch this building until I own it,'' he said. ''I'm already looking at space elsewhere because if I can't purchase this building I will have to move.''</p>
        <p>The town's contract with Burman had the backing of the Riverhead Development Committee, an advisory group for the Calverton property that was appointed by the town.</p>
        <p>''What we needed was a company with the experience and financial capital to take this property and turn it into an economically productive use,'' said Jesse R. Goodale III, a  businessman who is the chairman of the group. ''What it comes down to now in my estimation is whether or not both parties wish to close on this property, and I think that remains somewhat of a question on both sides.''</p>
        <p>THE $17 million price that Burman agreed to pay for the property has been criticized as being too low, and became a campaign issue last fall when Mr. Kozakiewicz successfully ran for town supervisor and Edward Densieski, calling the contract a ''Grumman giveaway,'' successfully ran for town councilman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kozakiewicz said he had never stated that the Burman contract was a ''bad deal.''  He added: ''I did question the terms of the deal, and I did question the amount paid for the property. But I know as an attorney that deals are not easily broken without some serious consequences and a chance that the property gets tied up in litigation for years. I am not of the mindset to tell Burman to go home and look for other property. I am hoping we can reach a consensus.''</p>
        <p>The continuing delays and uncertainties over a closing, Mr. Burman said, have already discouraged numerous offers for space in existing buildings and for vacant land, including offers from very large users.</p>
        <p>One company that looked elsewhere is a manufacturer of moldings for picture frames.</p>
        <p>''One of the reasons we didn't go ahead was because everything was in flux and nothing was for sure,'' said Gordon Van Vechten, the co-chairman of the company, which he did not want identified by name.</p>
        <p>The business, currently in four locations in Islip and Brookhaven, employs more than 100 people. Those jobs will be consolidated by next spring in Brookhaven in a new 100,000 square foot building on a site Mr. Van Vechten recently purchased.</p>
