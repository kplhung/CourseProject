        <p>A Density of Souls</p>
        <p>By Christopher Rice.</p>
        <p>Talk Miramax/Hyperion, $23.95.</p>
        <p>Everyone has a devastating secret -- usually several -- in this exceedingly humid novel set among a group of wealthy, troubled New Orleans teenagers. First novels are often criticized for being languid and tediously autobiographical, but those are two criticisms that can't be lodged against Christopher Rice's feverish debut. Rice, the son of the novelist Anne Rice, has crammed his book so full of incest, rape, hurricanes and murder that it is simultaneously daft and disturbing. The story focuses on the relationship of four childhood friends who, upon starting high school, promptly give up their games of hide-and-seek in Lafayette Cemetery and for somewhat mysterious reasons decide they are bitter enemies. Brandon and Greg become brutish football stars who feel compelled to torment their erstwhile friend Stephen, who is beautiful, sensitive and gay. Are they ashamed that they used to play sexual games with him? Does one of them still secretly long to? Meredith, the only girl in the group, becomes both alcoholic and bulimic, and begins an abusive relationship with Greg, whom she hates. None of it makes much sense, but it turns out that the parents of this dysfunctional clique have an intertwined and gothic history of their own, full of suicide, dementia and at least one long-buried affair -- which leads to the bizarre revelation that a pair of young male lovers are, in fact, brothers. This is bold, ambitious and wildly campy plotting. But the book takes itself far too seriously to be fun: It's scarily sincere and ultimately preposterous.</p>
