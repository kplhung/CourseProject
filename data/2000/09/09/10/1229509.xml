        <p>Representative Matt Salmon, a Republican, is not running for re-election this year in Arizona's First Congressional District. But the betting is that the district will remain in Republican hands -- unless the Republicans battling for their party's nomination in Tuesday's primary self-destruct and the lightly regarded Democratic nominee, David Mendoza, ekes out a victory come the fall.</p>
        <p>Two of the five Republican hopefuls -- Susan Bitter Smith and Tom Liddy -- have been accusing each other of engaging in convoluted dirty tricks. To wit:</p>
        <p>Mr. Liddy, a lawyer and the son of G. Gordon Liddy (he of Watergate dirty tricks infamy), says Ms. Bitter Smith, a cable television executive, slipped him a file that contained personal information about a third candidate, Jeff Flake, former executive director of the Goldwater Institute. As Mr. Liddy tells it, Ms. Bitter Smith then urged him to leak the file to reporters, something he says he refused to do.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bitter Smith contends she gave the file to Mr. Liddy only after he requested it. She says she received the file only after one of her campaign workers obtained it without her knowledge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flake has steered clear of all this, saying only that he has no secrets.</p>
        <p>Last weekend, The Arizona Republic, the state's leading newspaper, suggested that Mr. Liddy and Ms. Bitter Smith resolve their differences by taking lie detector tests.</p>
        <p>Both agreed. The tests were given on Monday -- by different examiners, with each candidate helping to word the questions.</p>
        <p>And?</p>
        <p>Both passed -- and immediately pledged to focus on issues in the remaining days before the primary.</p>
