        <p>THE Christmas tree went up that year. Pictures were taken, too, and despite the breakup of Kim Manghisi's marriage, no one could tell from the photos how miserable things were.</p>
        <p>The snapshots failed to show how Ms. Manghisi cried nearly every day after, she said, her husband backed a rental truck into the driveway of their new house in Yorktown Heights one Saturday in November -- six weeks after the birth of their second child -- and carted away much of their six years of life together.</p>
        <p>''I thought when I got married that I was going to have this normal life: the two kids and the suburban home and the nice vacations, and we were achieving all of that,'' Ms. Manghisi, 42, a nurse, said, sharing her story in a Mount Kisco church one August night with others trying to recover from divorce.</p>
        <p>''It was like the shattering of the dream.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Manghisi is one of the faces of divorce in Westchester, a place where, amid the well-educated residents and expensive houses, there is a steady population of couples heading to court.</p>
        <p>Of the 68,147 statewide divorce filings in 1997, the year of Ms. Manghisi's split, almost 3,000 were here. Divorce in Westchester declined slightly the next year, but marriages fell, too, by more than 50 percent in the same period, from 12,121 to 5,848, according to the State Health Department.</p>
        <p>The county's divorce rate is almost half the national average, because, historically, divorce is most common in poor areas, according to experts and figures from the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>
        <p>But while the numbers may be lower than in other areas, like the South, divorces here are often more complicated and contentious because they tend to be among people who have been married longer and have acquired more, experts said.</p>
        <p>No issue is too small when dismantling a suburban household. Who gets the chocolate Labrador retriever (or in some cases, its ashes), the Lenox china or a favorite rocking chair is argued on the seventh floor of the County Courthouse in White Plains.</p>
        <p>''Couples who divorce in Westchester are much wealthier than on average, so divorce tends to be more difficult, there is more to fight about,'' said Marsha Garrison, a Brooklyn Law School professor who has compared divorce outcomes in Westchester with those in New York City and in Onondaga County.</p>
        <p>Little has changed in the nine years since she wrote her study: more couples hire separate lawyers in Westchester; more women receive alimony, and child support payments are higher -- because people are more affluent.</p>
        <p>Nationally, people typically divorce after seven years of marriage, but here, lawyers say, it is more likely to be after 18 to 20 years. And while people around the country tend to be 31 to 33 when they divorce, Ms. Garrison said that in Westchester, ''you're likely to be talking about people who are older.'' The reason, she said, is: ''People who are highly educated tend to marry later. So, because you have a fairly well-educated group in Westchester, these are people typically who married later in life.''</p>
        <p>What is new here in recent years is that the cast of characters has expanded; in addition to the lawyers, there are divorce financial planners and real estate agents marketing condominiums or apartments to the newly single. Divorce mediation services, long popular in other parts of the country, are also expanding here.  And support groups continue to thrive in churches, community centers and private homes, helping divorcees recover emotionally.</p>
        <p>If litigated, divorce is usually very costly. But it rarely goes to trial here. The number of cases begun in court fell to 109 last year from 121 in 1997. Just a fraction of those finish with a verdict, judges in Westchester said, because the process is too grueling and too costly to see through.</p>
        <p>Ms. Manghisi was lucky: she survived the anguish -- and $16,000 in legal fees -- to tell her story inside the fieldstone St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Mount Kisco. As she spoke, a group of 50 divorced and separated men and women sat quietly on metal folding chairs arranged in a circle around her.</p>
        <p>Later, a handful in the group gathered down the road at the 24-hour Mount Kisco Coach diner to dissect Ms. Manghisi's story. The divorcees, including the group's founder and leader, Micki McWade, admitted that they had had suicidal or murderous thoughts in the wake of their marital splits.</p>
        <p>But that is just one of the complex sorts of emotions divorce can bring.</p>
        <p>''I felt myself becoming my losses,'' said Bette Samuel, 43, of Briarcliff Manor, who was in the church that night. She did not feel suicidal, but her divorce four years ago was more painful than the recent death of her mother or a miscarriage she suffered just before the divorce, she said.</p>
        <p>''I sat in a dark room and cried for six months,'' Ms. Samuel said. ''A lot of it was like: 'Why me? Why is this happening to me?' ''</p>
        <p>A few blocks away from the support group, at a bar in Mount Kisco, a 41-year-old man told how he found his wife in bed with another man, ''put the guy in the hospital'' and got drunk for a year. Ten years later, he still feels sad.</p>
        <p>A middle-age woman with dark hair said she split with her husband when the passion ran out of their 15-year marriage. Simple as that.</p>
        <p>''My ex is my best friend,'' the woman said, poking at a plate of sesame-crusted tuna. ''But would you want to sleep with your best friend?''</p>
        <p>Another woman said that she and her husband split up for a year, looked over the so-called cliff of divorce and retreated back to marriage.</p>
        <p>''Our two marriage counselors told us to learn how to fight,'' she said. ''You get married for reasons.''</p>
        <p>In a suburban enclave like Westchester, divorce puts an abrupt end to sharing a home and two cars, raising a family and establishing roots. It is a middle-age father, James M. McLernon of Millwood, still blaming himself six years after he left his wife. His biggest worry is that his children, ages 9 and 12, ''are the ones that got clobbered.''</p>
        <p>To others, divorce is a geographic and economic headache.</p>
        <p>It is David J. Lord, 51, of Armonk, divorced once and separated from his second wife since 1996, who has two sets of children, on Long Island and in Westchester, and accounting offices in each county. It is Eddie Wirchansky, 42, of Peekskill, barely able to afford a baby sitter, never mind pay back the thousands of dollars in legal fees his father provided for a divorce a year ago.</p>
        <p>It is a 49-year-old radiology technician from Larchmont who hopped over the border to Connecticut and filed because, unlike New York, divorce is no fault there.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, experts and those going through it say, divorce is about isolation.  And in a bedroom community where families are the norm, they said, it is especially hard to meet people after a divorce.</p>
        <p>''I think that suburbia is so built on family life, so built on Saturday barbecues, the kids' baseball games, the whole trying to make a Norman Rockwell life, that people in suburbia are hit so hard,'' said Monica S. Getz, who is herself divorced and founded the National Coalition for Family Justice, based in Irvington. The organization educates people heading for divorce and supports people who feel unjustly treated in matrimonial or family court.</p>
        <p>When they separated after 10 years of marriage in 1997, David and Donna Gage of Scarsdale were determined not to disrupt the lives of their 6-year-old triplets, Matthew, Robert and Allison. The couple never wanted them to have to leave their childhood home. So, they each found separate apartments nearby and swapped nights in the old Stratton Road homestead.</p>
        <p>For nearly two years, the adults shuttled in and out of the white split-level house. They were the ones forced to pack and unpack their bags. They had to change their phone numbers and rearrange their mail. They kept their problems from fracturing their children's lives. The children. happily, could still play soccer, ride on the swing-set or bounce on the trampoline in their backyard. Their live-in nanny also stayed with them in the home.</p>
        <p>''It was comfortable for them,'' Ms. Gage, 37, said. ''They were in their same bed. They had the same schedule. Everything was nondisruptive.''</p>
        <p>The parents found the arrangement ideal, if unusual. They could afford two rents and a mortgage. In her $800-a-month studio, in Harrison, Ms. Gage was always five minutes away. In his $1,300-a-month condominium in White Plains, Mr. Gage was always three miles up the road.</p>
        <p>''I got a lot of flak for it in the beginning,'' Mr. Gage, 48, said of the idea. ''People gave me a hard time. They said, 'It should be more of a traditional split,' and, 'Don't look back. It is not good to be in-between.' But it worked out great.'' With the divorce final, Ms. Gage is in the house with the children full time now. Visits with dad require overnight trips. But the children are older, Ms. Gage said. It is less of a shock.</p>
        <p>The Gages' solution was more the exception than the norm. Most cases are fought in courtrooms or legal offices. Ms. Getz said the legal system is fraught with problems and needs to be more family friendly.</p>
        <p>One remedy divorcees are turning to more and more, many said, is mediation.</p>
        <p>The Office of Court Administration in Albany wants divorce cases to be speedier and less adversarial, and efforts at reducing conflict have led to more mediators.</p>
        <p>In the county, Amelia T. DelVecchio was appointed recently to head a new program that offers couples alternatives to the legal wars over custody, visitation or future earnings potential. The program has 41 mediators, and the service is free and does not delay the proceeding, Ms. DelVecchio said.</p>
        <p>Complicating matters in Westchester, said Jacqueline W. Silbermann, administrative judge for matrimonial matters in New York, is that the two full-time judges who hear cases, John R. LaCava and Adrienne Hofmann Scancarelli, are leaving by year's end. That means that new judges, unfamiliar with cases that have already begun, will have to step in, Judge Silbermann said.</p>
        <p>A program that educates parents about custody and the impact of divorce on children is expanding, and a similar program for children will start in the fall.</p>
        <p>But mediation programs are not popular with everyone. If one spouse is abusive or fiscally domineering, it should not be attempted, most lawyers and judges said. Others say mediation adds an unnecessary layer to an already complex process.</p>
        <p>''The mediation process can be beneficial,'' said Martin T. Johnson, chairman of the Family Law Section of the State Bar Association, whose law offices are in White Plains and Pearl River. ''But it presupposes that both parties have an absolute handle of what their rights are, which is not always true.''</p>
        <p>Marcia Smithen Cohen's office in her Katonah home has a 40-inch round table, four identical chairs, a box of tissues and enough privacy to untangle complex domestic issues. Ms. Cohen, a lawyer, has traded dark pinstripe suits and heels for pants and sweaters; she's swapped advocacy for neutrality. She is a full-time mediator.</p>
        <p>''The mediator is required to be impartial and neutral,'' she said, adding that mediators ''empower people to make informed choices about their lives.''</p>
        <p>Westchester is home to many sophisticated business people, Ms. Cohen said, and they see mediation as a viable option.</p>
        <p>''The most important reason to consider a mediated divorce for people who have children is the realization that, like it or not, they are going to have to deal with each other through the children's lives,'' Ms. Cohen, 54, said. ''There will be events, school events, graduations, marriages, births when the parents who are ex-spouses will find themselves in close quarters.''</p>
        <p>Mediation provides training in how to cope with uncomfortable encounters.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cohen often receives referrals from therapists. She charges on a sliding scale, depending on a couple's income. Prices start at $200 an hour.</p>
        <p>Sometimes spouses patch up their differences after seeing her.</p>
        <p>''They will come to you not necessarily knowing what they want, so you have to help them find their voice,'' Ms. Cohen said. ''We frame issues and discuss how they might be resolved.''</p>
        <p>Two of the major issues in a divorce in suburbia are where to live and how to divide the assets while the divorce is winding its way through court. The economics can be so tight that couples are often forced to find creative, if tense, solutions. One idea is sharing a home.</p>
        <p>That is what Susan W. did when her marriage fell apart in 1996. She and her husband of 28 years, Michael, were born in New York city but moved to Westchester to take jobs as social service caseworkers.</p>
        <p>They bought their house in Rye Brook for $100,000 in 1979, and paid $1,200 a month for their mortgage on a combined $70,000 annual income. When their relationship died, they couldn't afford a second rent. So they split the house in half.</p>
        <p>She stayed in the master bedroom in a section of the house built in the 1700's. He moved 30 feet away into a section added on later. They shared the kitchen, split the utility bills, hired one lawyer instead of two and tried to ignore each other.</p>
        <p>''You are trying to make completely separate lives,'' Susan said. ''But you are in close quarters with a part of your life that fell apart. And you can't move on emotionally.''</p>
        <p>It is such a forbidding scenario that most people end up in any housing they can find.</p>
        <p>''Mostly they go to condos,'' said Maryellen Walsh, a broker for Houlihan/Lawrence, Westchester's largest residential realty concern, who usually gets a few calls each year from customers who bought houses from her as newlyweds and are now divorcing. ''Sometimes a temporary rental unit until they figure out what they are going to do. If they have a more expensive house, they downsize to a smaller home.''</p>
        <p>New living arrangements spur new household budgets, and divorcing couples often need financial planning, experts say.</p>
        <p>That is where Mary Prior steps in. Her one-year-old divorce financial planning service, Financial Priorities, of Valhalla, is what she said she needed while going through her own divorce in 1996 after a 25-year marriage.</p>
        <p>''So many times people don't understand the finances and, well, everyone is in a fog,'' she said. ''A lot of people just say 'I want it to be over with,' and then a year later they are in financial difficulty and are sorry.''</p>
        <p>Because women tend to be hit harder economically, Ms. Prior said most of the roughly 50 clients she has seen have been middle-age women.</p>
        <p>''A lot of times,'' she said, ''the women will want to keep the house because there are children involved, and the children are established in the school district and they don't want to disrupt their lives.''</p>
        <p>Other times, the financial and social hardships are so great in suburbia that some couples opt against divorce despite troubled marriages.</p>
        <p>''Divorce is a very high-risk strategy for making your life better,'' said Maggie Gallagher of Ossining, director of the marriage program at the Institute for American Values, a Manhattan research organization that favors marriage and family. ''It will certainly create another large and imposing set of problems.''</p>
        <p>As a matrimonial lawyer, with offices across the street from Family Court in the Bronx, Alina R. Rosenthal had seen her share of terrible divorces: the domestic violence and sex abuse that clients endured; the adultery, abusive or cruel behavior and the couples ''out for blood'' in contested cases.</p>
        <p>By comparison, her own marital problems were small. And yet, her problems still propelled her to leave her husband, Shalom Zellingher, twice.</p>
        <p>The first time, six years ago, she traded her husband of 13 years, their two children, their two cats, their housekeeper and their Ardsley-on-Hudson home for an apartment in Queens and an imminent divorce. There were deep differences over religion and the schooling of the children. But eight months later she moved back home.</p>
        <p>Then, in November 1996, she tried to leave her husband and their problems behind again. This time everyone but her husband joined her in a nearby apartment. But again everyone returned to the Ardsley home eight months later.</p>
        <p>''In 16 years, our lives are inextricably intertwined,'' Ms. Rosenthal said. ''You can't erase that.''</p>
        <p>The couple lived the realities that divorce entailed, and it scared them. They went to counseling. They read books. They thought of the emotional and economic toll their daughters would suffer. A move, a change of schools and problems brought on by what Ms. Rosenthal calls the ''inherent sadness of knowing mom and dad are not together and it's not because one of them is gone or dead.''</p>
        <p>Today, despite the same issues over religion (he's an Orthodox Jew and she is a Conservative Jew), the couple is still together. They are far from perfect, Ms. Rosenthal said, but divorce is not the answer.</p>
        <p>''We both realized that apart is not necessarily better,'' Ms. Rosenthal said. ''Life alone was not necessarily better.''</p>
