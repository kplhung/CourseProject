        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Givers'' (Aug. 13): I was a member of the New York Catholic Worker community from 1983 to 1987. Although challenging and a bit frightening at times, living there was one of the most enriching opportunities of my life (I am now a social worker). I was never a model Catholic Worker. While living there I came out as a lesbian and temped at major corporations to supplement my ''ice cream money.'' Living at the Worker helped me learn how to live well with those in my community with whom I disagreed.</p>
