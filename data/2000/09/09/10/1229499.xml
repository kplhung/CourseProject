        <p>A study showed that if American eighth graders continued to improve their basic math skills at the pace they have since 1973, it would take 125 years for them to catch up with their peers in Singapore -- assuming those students don't raise their own scores. The study, by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (the standardized tests known as the nation's report card), showed that while scores on a new test emphasizing problem-solving and geometry have risen steadily throughout the 1990's, performance on a test stressing arithmetic has improved only slightly, and reading scores have been practically flat since 1971.</p>
