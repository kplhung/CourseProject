        <p>Maybe Army should have reverted to the wishbone against Boston College today in the Black Knights' loss at Michie Stadium.</p>
        <p>Unveiling in its home opener a new coach, Todd Berry, and the one-back, three-wideout passing offense that replaced the run-oriented wishbone, which Army had used for 16 years, the Black Knights came out throwing from the start.</p>
        <p>Quarterback Chad Jenkins completed 5 of his first 6 passes, and with Jenkins accounting for 47 yards on 2 passes, the Black Knights drove 70 yards for the game's first touchdown on their second possession. A reserve running back, Josh Holden, scored on a slithering run along the right side.</p>
        <p>But that lead was short-lived as a Boston College backup tailback, William Green, returned the ensuing kickoff 84 yards to the Army 8-yard line. Then, Cedric Washington bolted up the middle to score, and the Eagles were on their way to a 55-17 rout of the Black Knights before a crowd of 37,544.</p>
        <p>The 38-point loss matched the worst home defeat ever for Army (0-2), which was playing with only four days off after losing its opener Monday at Cincinnati, 23-17. Army was beaten, 45-7, by Pittsburgh in 1980.</p>
        <p>Today's game was close throughout the first half. Had it not been for a pass interception at Army's 32 late in the first quarter and an ill-advised onside kickoff, the Black Knights could have kept it closer. But the interception led to the Eagles going ahead by 14-7. And the onside kick -- following a 27-yard field goal by Brendan Mullen that had trimmed the deficit to 14-10 -- set the stage for a 60-yard Eagles' drive. Mike Sutphin hit his second field goal, from 24 yards out, to provide a 17-10 lead as time expired in the half.</p>
        <p>Those 3 points turned out to be the first of 17 scored by the visitors over a span of 37 seconds. Following the second-half kickoff, Boston College quarterback Tim Hasselbeck connected with wide receiver Dedrick Dewalt on the first play for a 75-yard touchdown.</p>
        <p>Then, 20 seconds later, Curtis Bolden, a B.C. linebacker, picked off a Jenkins pass on Army's first play of the half and raced down the left sideline untouched for a 22-yard touchdown. The Eagles scored four unanswered touchdowns in the third period to take a 48-10 lead.</p>
        <p>The Eagles added a final touchdown late in the fourth period, as did Army. The Black Knights' second touchdown came with two seconds left when Curtis Zervik, the third-string quarterback, passed 12 yards to Clinton Woody, a freshman wide receiver, to cap a 63-yard drive.</p>
        <p>''We played two different halves,'' Berry said. ''We should have reacted better in the second half and we've got to make things happen.''</p>
        <p>Hasselbeck, a senior, connected on 14 of 21 passes for 256 yards and 3 touchdowns, 2 of them by Dewalt. Hasselbeck's backup, Brian St. Pierre, was no less effective, hitting on 6 of 8 passes for 89 yards. That added up to 335 passing yards to 193 yards by Army. The B.C. quarterbacks did not throw an interception; Jenkins was intercepted twice.</p>
