        <p>All the City, and a Stage</p>
        <p>Fleetwood Stage and the city of New Rochelle are a happy mix, according to the company's founder and producing director, Lewis Arlt. ''The move here was hugely successful,'' said Mr. Arlt, who will star in the group's production of Ira Levin's ''Deathtrap,'' starting Sept. 21. ''We're part of the spirit of the redevelopment of the city.''</p>
        <p>The theater company, which is beginning its eighth season, moved to the craggy grounds of Wildcliff, overlooking Long Island Sound, four years ago. The city, which owns the theater building and rents it to Fleetwood for a nominal fee, helps both officially and ''as a group of individuals,'' Mr. Arlt said. That means the driveway gets plowed, and familiar faces lend panache to fund-raising events.</p>
        <p>Fleetwood has also been a boon to Mr. Arlt's many faceted career. He has both acted and directed with the company, most recently appearing in ''The Importance of Being Earnest,'' and directing ''The Comedy of Errors.'' In ''Deathtrap,'' a 1978 comedy-thriller directed by Nelson Sheeley, he will appear as a playwright prepared to kill for success. Mr. Arlt also played the role last winter at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''It's a dream come true,'' he said of the chance to juggle jobs at Fleetwood. The actor-director's open secret is that he is also a writer, having provided 15 years of dialogue for soap operas like ''Ryan's Hope,'' ''General Hospital'' and ''Another World.''</p>
        <p>So what does he like to do best? ''Acting is easier than directing and writing,'' he said.  ''Writing is a grind, all that pressure and responsibility. And the problem with directing for theater is that you can't make a living at it.''</p>
        <p>Fleetwood Stage is ''hovering near the black,'' he said, and hopes to sell out its 105-seat theater with four main stage productions this season. Ticket information: (914) 654-8533.</p>
        <p>Orchestra's Fund-Raising Awards</p>
        <p>At 75, the Westchester Symphony Orchestra is by far the county's oldest orchestra.  It has also changed more dramatically than other county orchestras, beginning as an avocational group and gradually climbing toward full professionalism (as measured by the level of both the playing and the pay scale).</p>
        <p>''The musicians have consistently been getting raises and benefits,'' said Anthony Aibel, the group's 31-year-old conductor and music director. ''I think within the next two or three years, we'll be up to union scale.''</p>
        <p>The orchestra has begun a new fund-raising strategy with its Bravissimo Awards, which are planned as yearly presentations to respected county residents in the arts, education and government.  Awards call for a celebration, and the first such event -- to honor George S. Latimer, chairman of the County Board of Legislators, and Robert Merrill, the baritone -- will be a dinner party with cocktails on Sept. 24 from 5 to 8 p.m. at the Mamaroneck Beach and Yacht Club. Tickets range from $150 to $1,000, and proceeds will benefit the orchestra's children's and community outreach programs. Information: (914) 631-4313.</p>
        <p>A Regional Theater From Purchase</p>
        <p>Each year students in the drama division of Purchase College stage a series of plays that go largely unseen by the larger community.</p>
        <p>Yet a senior in the 25-year-old film and theater division is just a short step away from the professional stage, and a relatively large number of recent Purchase graduates have gone on to major careers: Wesley Snipes, Stanley Tucci, Sherry Stringfield, Edie Falco and Parker Posey, to name a few.</p>
        <p>Besides the freshness of the youthful casts, the plays -- which are often professionally directed -- benefit from the versatile theaters of the college's Performing Arts Center, which provide a malleable ''black box'' as well as the traditional proscenium stage.</p>
        <p>This school year the division will offer seven plays  to the public in a  subscription series on Friday nights, which also includes several unannounced events. Subscribers at the $150 level are also entitled to break bread with famous alumni at three opening night dinners. (Subscribers at the $75 level just get to see the plays.) ''The goal here is to create a regional theater,'' said Walter H. Liebman, a former trustee of the Purchase College Foundation, who came up with the idea for the series.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liebman said the quality of the acting would be high, considering the rigorous screening of program applicants and the weeding-out process during four years of study. ''It is a very good regional theater,'' he said. ''There's nothing between here and New Haven that compares to it.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  October 8, 2000, Sunday  A brief report in the Footlights column on Sept. 10 about Lewis Arlt, artistic director of Fleetwood Stage in New Rochelle, misstated his role in a production of ''Deathtrap'' last winter at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey. He played a supporting role; the lead character was played by Jonathan Hadary.</p>
