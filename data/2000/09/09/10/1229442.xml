        <p>By day, Al Gore will be talking about education. By night, he will be raising money.</p>
        <p>This coming week, the vice president will campaign in the swing states Illinois and Ohio to emphasize education, then comb the Northeast corridor for cash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore will appear on two television talk shows -- Oprah Winfrey on Monday in Chicago and David Letterman on Thursday in New York. He also has fund-raisers in Philadelphia on Tuesday, Boston on Wednesday and New York on Thursday that should raise at least $6 million.</p>
        <p>The fund-raising comes as Democrats lag in the money chase. Gov. George W. Bush has raised nearly $100 million, and the Bush campaign has spent twice as much each week on television commercials.</p>
        <p>A Republican official said that the party planned to step up its anti-Gore commercials next week, a barrage that Mr. Gore told his supporters they needed to counter.</p>
        <p>''You know, the other side has pulled out all the stops and has gone just way beyond what anybody ever thought would happen in the post-Watergate reform era in not staying within the guidelines and so forth,'' Mr. Gore said at a reception in Atlanta on Friday, where 250 people paid  $1,000 each. ''So if you could help us just remain in the same ball park, just close, then that's what we need.''</p>
        <p>According to the Center for Public Integrity, from January 1999 through May 31, 2000, Mr. Gore raised $47.7 million, spent $39 million and had  $8.2 million in cash. Mr. Bush raised $87.5 million, spent $79.5 million and had $7.1 million on hand.</p>
        <p>In the 18 months ending June 30, the Democratic National Committee collected $118.6 million in soft-money donations, the unregulated contributions, nearly erasing the traditional Republican advantage in such contributions. The Republican National Committee reported $137 million in soft-money donations over the same period.</p>
