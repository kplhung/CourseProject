        <p>SUPER SATURDAY at the United States Open has always been a noisy, hectic experience that often leaves me with a giant tennis hangover, but as a concept, I can't knock it. The other Grand Slams give the women their own day to play for the big prize, but they also pay them less than they do the men.</p>
        <p>Call it a draw, and don't feel sorry for Venus Williams, whose wait until dark yesterday was worth her first Open title, her second straight Grand Slam victory, her 26th consecutive match victory and $800,000 worth of pocket money of which the government will want its share.</p>

        <p>SUPER SATURDAY at the United States Open has always been a noisy, hectic experience that often leaves me with a giant tennis hangover, but as a concept, I can't knock it. The other Grand Slams give the women their own day to play for the big prize, but they also pay them less than they do the men.</p>
        <p>Call it a draw, and don't feel sorry for Venus Williams, whose wait until dark yesterday was worth her first Open title, her second straight Grand Slam victory, her 26th consecutive match victory and $800,000 worth of pocket money of which the government will want its share.</p>
        <p>''Can you lower my taxes?'' Williams asked President Clinton when he telephoned and apologized for not sticking around after watching the men.</p>
        <p>Clinton said he'd try, to which Williams volleyed back, ''Should I read your lips?''</p>
        <p>Political and social niceties don't come naturally to this 20-year-old burgeoning star. Her idea of engagement is to blast away until she gets her way, as she did with Lindsay Davenport after falling into a 1-4 first-set hole, on the way to winning, 6-4, 7-5.</p>
        <p>It is no big deal if the Williams sisters don't bond with Davenport and Martina Hingis. Steffi Graf was no one's best friend, and nobody will ask how Pete Sampras gets along with Marat Safin, whom he'll meet this afternoon for the men's title. It wouldn't kill the Williams family, from Richard on down, to be a little more gracious to their opponents, but as far as Venus Williams's tennis goes, just hit her the damn ball.</p>
        <p>By late in the third set of Sampras's 7-6 (7), 6-4, 7-6 (5) victory over the Australian Lleyton Hewitt, that was pretty much the attitude in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Come on, Pete, get on with it. On the broadcast feed, one of the network announcers was even overheard to say: ''I've seen enough of this. Let's bring on the women.''</p>
        <p>When Davenport and Williams hit the court, Patti LaBelle's sonic version of the national anthem caused a cloudburst and sent the players back to the locker room to ignore each other some more. Whom to blame? Not even the Republicans could pin this one on Clinton, who had watched Sampras advance to his sixth Open final from a luxury box.</p>
        <p>For the women, their patience was rewarded with more exposure, a Saturday night live slot. They used to shoehorn the gals between the men's semifinals, but anywhere you put them these days, the final is the final. It stands on its own and it stands tall, regardless of whom the men serve up in their semis.</p>
        <p>For almost two weeks at the Open, the men played the more compelling matches and the women still got the majority of the attention. From the second round on, 50 of the 60 women's matches were won in straight sets. Seles-Capriati? Straight sets. Hingis-Seles? Straight sets. Serena Williams-Davenport? Straight sets.</p>
        <p>Lack of overall tour depth gives the women more of a name-brand quality to their events. They consistently have the same players, the star value, running through the draw at the major tournaments, on any surface. The late-round matchups among the top-ranked players are more than anticipated. They are counted on. And when they deliver spectacularly, as Venus Williams and Hingis did Friday afternoon, their primary rivalries grow. Momentum for the next event builds.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to dispute the opinion of Sampras as the best player of either sex, even if he hasn't won the French Open and, at this point, is not likely to. It isn't Sampras's fault that the crop of challengers in recent years has largely been a collection of interchangeable parts, from one year to the next.</p>
        <p>Going for his 14th Slam victory, he dodged a first-set tiebreak bullet yesterday, when Hewitt acted 19 with a short ball in the middle of the court on set point. He went for too much and spanked it wide. Then Sampras rallied from service break down in the third set, and set up match point with two demonstrations of his trademark athletic brilliance: a magnificent low backhand volley off a blistering Hewitt backhand, and a leaping overhead winner off a Hewitt lob a few feet short of the baseline.</p>
        <p>Sampras and Safin went off to meet the president, who was still in United Nations Summit mode when he assured the 20-year-old Russian: ''You have a bright future.''</p>
        <p>The primary hope of the ''New Balls'' generation, Safin may be ready to move up near the top and stick around a while. He presents a formidable challenge for Sampras today, even if they didn't know him from Yevgeny Kafelnikov at the Open's transportation desk.</p>
        <p>''I called like three times,'' he said after beating Todd Martin to reach his first Slam final in the morning semifinal, 6-3, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (1).</p>
        <p>'' 'Please, can I have a car to come to the stadium?'</p>
        <p>'' 'What's your name?'</p>
        <p>'' 'Safin.'</p>
        <p>'' 'Can you spell it please?' ''</p>
        <p>It was a decade ago yesterday that that a 19-year-old Sampras practically needed a name tag as he introduced himself as the player for his generation, and beyond. By the time Williams and Davenport struck their first evening ball, the Safin-Martin match seemed as dated as Sampras's first Open title.</p>
        <p>It was a long, long day, but in the end, there was Williams holding the trophy and her father doing some silly dance on the court and Serena congratulating Venus from the family box the way Venus congratulated Serena one year ago. Tennis is a Williams's and a woman's world right now, and not even the world's most powerful man could argue with that.</p>
        <p>''Too many Rick Lazio commercials,'' Venus told the lame duck president on the phone. ''Tell Hillary I said, 'All the way.' ''</p>
