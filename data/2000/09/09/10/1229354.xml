        <p>BRITNEY SPEARS owes Joey Heatherton a big one. And let's not forget the unpaid image debt incurred by Christina Aguilera and Mandy Moore. Ms. Heatherton, the older reader may recall, was a Long Island-born nymphet who parlayed her hooded eyes, blond shag and husky alto into a long career as a cut-rate Lolita, playing Las Vegas lounges, episodes of ''Laverne and Shirley'' and many seasons of Serta Perfect Sleeper mattress ads.</p>
        <p>As sex kittens go, Ms. Heatherton was no Sue Lyon. But then Ms. Lyon never had Ms. Heatherton's staying power as a demicelebrity and sultry permateen. And that, after all, is the hold Ms. Spears, Ms. Moore and Ms. Aguilera have on the popular imagination, as anyone who saw the MTV Video Music Awards on Thursday night can verify. As did Ms. Heatherton before them, these women look as though they could get you arrested. Unlike her, however, they've used that appeal to build major recording careers.</p>

        <p>BRITNEY SPEARS owes Joey Heatherton a big one. And let's not forget the unpaid image debt incurred by Christina Aguilera and Mandy Moore. Ms. Heatherton, the older reader may recall, was a Long Island-born nymphet who parlayed her hooded eyes, blond shag and husky alto into a long career as a cut-rate Lolita, playing Las Vegas lounges, episodes of ''Laverne and Shirley'' and many seasons of Serta Perfect Sleeper mattress ads.</p>
        <p>As sex kittens go, Ms. Heatherton was no Sue Lyon. But then Ms. Lyon never had Ms. Heatherton's staying power as a demicelebrity and sultry permateen. And that, after all, is the hold Ms. Spears, Ms. Moore and Ms. Aguilera have on the popular imagination, as anyone who saw the MTV Video Music Awards on Thursday night can verify. As did Ms. Heatherton before them, these women look as though they could get you arrested. Unlike her, however, they've used that appeal to build major recording careers.</p>
        <p>''Recording'' may be the wrong word in that sentence. That these women (Ms. Aguilera in particular) can sing is not in question. That they do sing is probably moot. Their real appeal is probably closer to that of calendar models. These just happen to move. And anyway, music of all sorts was weirdly secondary on Thursday to the more central experience of watching the celebrity machine grind away. For six hours or so, the Avenue of the Americas became a red-carpeted conveyor belt on which singing starlets were cranked past banks of cameras, followed by gangsta rappers and dimpled boy bands and superannuated rockers who had apparently lost the directions to the Aged Rock Star Country Home. (Memo to Steve Tyler: Have you considered a Roth I.R.A.?)</p>
        <p>It was a night of limos more extended than some careers. (Remember Ricky Martin? So hot eight months ago, and yet no one seemed too excited about his shaking bonbon now.) It was a night of cheap fur, do-rags, statement eyeglasses, fake Gucci, real Gucci, jailhouse denims, wonderfully bad rock fashions (the rock singer Pink dressed as if she were the offspring of Sid Vicious and Poison Ivy of the Cramps), crimped blond tresses, bleached Afros, platform boots and compulsory Wonderbras. ''I'm standing looking down at bald spots and cleavage,'' said a V.J. posted on the balcony inside Radio City Music Hall. Some of them were on the same people, as he went on to say.</p>
        <p>It was a night of journalists' reporting on events by watching television in Rockefeller Plaza tents, and of fans crammed behind police barricades a block from the Music Hall, idly hoping to catch a glimpse of someone, anyone.</p>
        <p>''We're just trapped, basically,'' said Felicia Buchert, who had come from Florida just for the show. ''Maybe we'll see Madonna. Who knows?''</p>
        <p>It didn't happen. Madonna was in Morocco plucking her eyebrows and changing diapers for her infant son, Rocco, as she explained by satellite phone to MTV's Serena Altschul. Most of the other notables were sequestered in nearby hotel rooms, their limo arrivals timed with air-traffic-control precision, their appearances calculated exclusively in terms of television time.</p>
        <p>Even the 100 guys who had been hired to walk behind Eminem dressed like him in white T-shirts as he sang ''The Real Slim Shady,'' winner of the Best Male Video award, barely saw the singer. Parked in the solarium of the Women's National Republican Club on 51st Street until showtime, they missed most of the event.</p>
        <p>''We basically got told some lies,'' said Joseph Brugess, 20, of Ridgewood, Queens, who got the job after answering a Web site ad asking for Eminem look-alikes with bleached blond hair. ''They led us to believe we were going to be on stage,'' he said. Instead, ''we're stuck here 8 hours yesterday, 11 hours today, and all we're getting paid is 80 beans.''</p>
        <p>For those lucky few granted media access to a corridor around Radio City, a few quiet hours at the Calvin Coolidge Library in the Women's National Republican Club started to seem appealing. There are limited returns on a middle distance sighting of, say, the rapper Sisqo, who would be easy to miss even at close range.</p>
        <p>''Is he five feet, even?'' asked Delores McFadden, a tourist who had miraculously finagled her way past the New York Police Department, MTV security and the Music Hall guards to find a spot near the theater entrance. ''I mean, you can barely see the guy.''</p>
        <p>Stars tend to be like that, Ms. McFadden noted, zeppelin egos in Napoleonic bodies. ''Well, you could see eye to eye with Sting, at least,'' she told a bystander who had momentarily mistaken the wizened singer for the venerable actor Richard Harris.</p>
        <p>Even fragments of Sisqo and Sting were more than Javier Perez got. After waiting since 4 a.m. for a chance to see the celebrity arrivals, Mr. Perez, 17, wound up squeezed into a patch of sidewalk across the Avenue of the Americas. Standing on tiptoe, he did briefly catch a glimpse of a mohawk belonging to the Red Hot Chili Peppers bass player, Flea.</p>
        <p>''I thought that was a really cool memory,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even this fleeting apparition was more than Christina Peterson and Stacey Sawaya, of California and Ohio respectively, got as they sat by a truck bay from which, someone had told them, 'N Sync might make its escape. As for this reporter, he finally fetched up outside the defunct Fashion Cafe, where some of the 26 little people hired to add a frisson to the evening's Blink 182 finale were hanging out.</p>
        <p>''You know, I almost didn't come,'' said Niki Botelho-Pabros, a 3-foot-6 performer who was dressed for the night in a leopard-print bikini top with leather dominatrix armbands and combat boots. Dragging on a Marlboro Light, Ms. Botelho-Pabros said: ''I thought it would be exploitative and I tend to stay away from that stigma type of elf and clown job.'' She decided to stick around, however, when it became clear that to exploit a bunch of dwarfs and midgets for shock appeal would be difficult to accomplish on an awards show where Howard Stern once flew from the rafters baring his behind.</p>
