        <p>They haven't rolled off a production line since 1958, but Packard automobiles remain popular with collectors. So it is not surprising that a search of eBay and other auction Web sites can turn up hundreds of Packard items for sale: classic cars, parts, memorabilia -- and, for a few days last week, the whole company.</p>
        <p>Or more precisely, the new incarnation of the Packard Motor Car Company, created in 1995 when an entrepreneur, Roy Gullickson, acquired the rights to the long-dormant Packard name and logo and began trying to develop a new luxury car to put them on.</p>
        <p>The company, appropriately based in Phoenix, did manage to build one sedan prototype with an aluminum frame, all-wheel drive, a V-12 engine, a vaguely old-fashioned grille and modern styling elsewhere. It has displayed it at auto shows and on a Web site, www.packardmotorcar.com, and says it has taken about 80 tentative orders despite a projected price tag said to be north of $135,000. But no more of the cars have yet been built, and the sedan's coupe and convertible siblings remain on the drawing board.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gullickson decided to sell his embryonic operation, he turned to Kruse International, an auction house specializing in classic cars that was acquired by eBay in 1999. Kruse agreed to offer a package deal simultaneously on eBay and at Kruse's big annual car auction in Auburn, Ind., beginning on Aug. 31. The package would consist of the company; the trademark rights; the new car line's plans, tools, dies and molds; the Web site; the one and only working sedan; and a nonworking full-scale model.</p>
        <p>Apparently, online auctions work better for cars than for car companies. Ten offers came in before the bidding closed on Labor Day afternoon, according to Kevin Purs glove, a spokesman for eBay, but the highest was just $275,100, valuing the company and the other assets about the same as the one existing car. The (undisclosed) reserve price was not met, so there was no sale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pursglove said that four or five other businesses had been successfully auctioned on eBay, though each fetched much less than was offered for Packard. He said eBay hoped Mr. Gullickson would try again, after some of the bidders, who had contacted him,  had had a chance to check out the business more thoroughly.</p>
