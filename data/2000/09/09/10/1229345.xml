        <p>ON Aug. 21, 1998, a little-known investment partnership in Greenwich, Conn., lost $553 million. The loss on that single sunny Friday left the behemoth fund with $2.9 billion in capital, down from $4.67 billion just months earlier.</p>
        <p>The fund, of course, was Long-Term Capital Management, which was born in the brain of an enigmatic Wall Street bond trader named John W. Meriwether. By September 1998, with world markets already roiled by a Russian bond default, the enormous fund was teetering at the edge of failure, with many of the world's biggest banks and brokerage houses shackled to it by countless links of leverage.</p>
        <p>If the hedge fund failed, who else would be pulled down with it? And how would a market already nearing the thin edge of panic react? Faced with those questions -- and with the impossibility of receiving reliable answers in the time available -- the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York called the fund's top creditors, the chieftains of Wall Street, to an emergency meeting at which they ultimately agreed to bail out the fund with fresh capital.</p>
        <p>That dramatic and still controversial rescue, and the events that let up to it, are the threads that Roger Lowenstein weaves into ''When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management'' (Random House, $26.95). This richly textured and lucid account is not the first book to try to parse the secrecy that shrouded those events. ''Inventing Money: The Story of Long-Term Capital and the Legends Behind It,'' by Nicholas Dunbar (Wiley &amp; Sons), added a wealth of financial history and market theory to the core story.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lowenstein, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, has taken a completely different path, examining the events primarily through the prism of human nature. The results are a riveting account that reaches beyond the market landscape to say something universal about risk and triumph, about hubris and failure.</p>
        <p>Central to the story is Mr. Meriwether himself, an accountant's son who grew up in a close-knit neighborhood in Chicago. An honor student with a mathematical bent, he parlayed his passion for golf into a college scholarship. Even as a teenager, he was an avid but cautious gambler, holding his cards -- and his ambitions -- close to his chest.</p>
        <p>After college, he taught high school mathematics for a year, then enrolled in the University of Chicago's business school, working his way through as an analyst for a large insurer. In 1974, at 27, he was hired by Salomon Brothers, one of the leading bond-trading houses on the Street. Three years later, after making millions for the firm speculating on government and municipal bonds, he formed the arbitrage group, which used Salomon's own capital to exploit tiny disparities in bond prices.</p>
        <p>To help him find these opportunities, he recruited a band of mathematical scholars, young academics whose awesome intelligence gave Mr. Meriwether the edge he sought in the increasingly competitive markets. The group was remarkably isolated from the rest of Salomon Brothers, and Mr. Meriwether protected them from even the normal human interaction of the workplace. ''The professors were brilliant at reducing a trade to pluses and minuses; they could strip a ham sandwich to its component risks; but they could barely carry on a normal conversation,'' Mr. Lowenstein says.</p>
        <p>They were a remarkable band, and most of them became permanent acolytes at Mr. Meriwether's altar, following him at every step of his career: Eric Rosenfeld, an M.I.T.-trained assistant professor at the Harvard Business School; Victor J. Haghani, a graduate of the London School of Economics; and the rigidly rational Lawrence Hilibrand, who has two degrees from M.I.T. Mr. Meriwether left Salomon Brothers after a brush with scandal -- he was the supervisor of a trader caught manipulating Treasury securities.  He then started his own hedge-fund replica of the arbitrage group, adding three high priests of finance: Robert C. Merton and Myron S. Scholes, Nobel laureates for work relating to options pricing, and David W. Mullins Jr., who had been vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.</p>
        <p>These men all possessed an unswerving faith in the notion that markets are fundamentally rational and efficient, and that every price generated in that marketplace is the correct one. Among economists, this so-called efficient market theory is just that, a theory, reflecting a Platonic ideal of the marketplace. Moreover, the theory assumes that trading in any market is more or less continuous and that prices move smoothly from one level to the next nearest level, giving everyone a chance to adjust portfolios rationally to reflect the changes.</p>
        <p>Through Mr. Lowenstein's compassionate eye, we watch as these fascinating coddled geniuses discover what any dedicated flea-market shopper already knows: in real life, people buy and sell things for reasons entirely unconnected to rationality. As he notes, the mathematical laws governing a coin toss rest on the fact that ''the coin doesn't remember that it landed on tails three times in a row; the odds on the fourth flip are still 50-50.''</p>
        <p>''But markets have memories,'' he says. ''Sometimes a trend will continue just because traders expect (or fear) that it will.''</p>
        <p>He adds: ''After three bad 'flips' in the market, the fourth flip may no longer be completely random. Some traders may have taken losses and be forced to sell; other investors, looking over their shoulders, may panic and decide to beat them to it.''</p>
        <p>And that is pretty much what happened in the galloping climax to the Long-Term Capital story. ''The partners believed that, over time, investors would become more rational, more steady, more efficient -- more like they were,'' Mr. Lowenstein concludes. Instead, as the story unfolds, Mr. Meriwether's brilliant followers became more irrational, greedier, more oblivious to their own flaws -- in short, more like the rest of us.</p>
