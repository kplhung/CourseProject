        <p>RUDI'S FAMILY RESTAURANT is an idea in the making and a good one. With Central American restaurants popping up all over Long Island -- and most diners largely ignoring them -- the folks who run DiMaggio's and Il Forno in Port Washington are trying a creative new approach to lure non-Hispanic diners as well as Spanish-speaking patrons.</p>
        <p>A few months ago, along with a Latino partner, they opened Rudi's, a Central American-Italian spot in Mineola, joining the Island's best known and most popular cuisine with one that is virtually unknown locally.

        <p>RUDI'S FAMILY RESTAURANT is an idea in the making and a good one. With Central American restaurants popping up all over Long Island -- and most diners largely ignoring them -- the folks who run DiMaggio's and Il Forno in Port Washington are trying a creative new approach to lure non-Hispanic diners as well as Spanish-speaking patrons.</p>
        <p>A few months ago, along with a Latino partner, they opened Rudi's, a Central American-Italian spot in Mineola, joining the Island's best known and most popular cuisine with one that is virtually unknown locally. Situated, somewhat surprisingly, in the heart of Mineola's Portuguese enclave at 247 Mineola Boulevard (516-873-0018), Rudi's is a find; in fact, in many respects a steal.</p>
        <p>It is still a work in progress, a Salvadoran-style restaurant with an Italian overlay rather than a half-and-half partnership. The portions are large, the food is tasty and the prices are right at this immaculate eatery with its wall-sized tropical mural, brick-backed bar, bare tables, jukebox, televisions, illuminated breakfronts and artificial flowers.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that, at this point in its evolution, no one on Rudi's smiling, eager-to-please staff speaks much English, and credit cards aren't accepted. Nevertheless, an English menu and savvy, obliging waitresses make ordering a relatively simple task.</p>
        <p>The Italian dishes here are at least the equal of the mainly Salvadoran-style entries, and a very fresh mixed salad (marinated olives and red peppers, onions, carrots, cabbage, lettuce and tomatoes with a noteworthy olive-oil dressing) is included in the cost of the bountiful entrees, which start at $7.95.</p>
        <p>Crunchy, warm bread begins all dinners, and they conclude with an impressive -- and free -- fruit plate (ripe melon, sweet grapes, cherries and whipped cream).</p>
        <p>Rudi's gives diners an opportunity to order a few familiar, reliable Italian favorites or to sample some Central American specialties for the first time. Those who follow a mix-and-match strategy will not go home hungry or broke. Start on the Italian side with a big plate of tender, greaseless, feathery-light calamari ($5.95) accompanied by pulpy tomato sauce, or with a creamy first-rate Caesar salad ($6.95).</p>
        <p>Then take a trip South of the border, and pick an array of the less expensive Latino appetizers. Try pupusas ($2), pancake-shaped corn tortillas stuffed with combinations of cheese, pork rind and beans, and paired with a hill of delicate, cooling cole slaw; chorizo Colombiano ($2.50), spicy Spanish sausage with plenty of flavor; chicken tamales ($2.95), tender chicken in a soft wrapper with a curl of radicchio containing a tangy tomato-onion-herb salsa; or a special of fiery, chunky guacamole ($2.50) with warm homemade nachos.</p>
        <p>Chicken, an entree staple on both sides of the menu, varies. White meat tends to be overcooked, while dark meat dishes are moist, even juicy. Rice with chicken and shrimp ($13.95) suffers from two problems: dry breast meat and bits of messy-to-eat shrimp in the shell. Better choices are the hefty chunks of skewered shrimp, chicken, beef and vegetables ($14.95) and the pollo guisado ($10.95), a garlic-scented chicken stew loaded with potatoes, carrots, onions and olives.</p>
        <p>Chicken cacciatore ($10.95), packing lively Latino seasoning is a cross-cultural success, and lobster fra diavolo ($14.95), a special, contained a ton of linguine, a jumbo South African lobster tail and a not unpleasant but rather tame tomato sauce.</p>
        <p>Main courses other than pastas come with enough reasonably tasty yellow rice to feed a family. An earthy, comforting lasagna della nonna, flavored with layers of meat and cheese, is a lip-smacking bargain at $9.95.</p>
        <p>Desserts and drinks at Rudi's make quite a statement. Both a rich, creamy homemade tiramisu ($4.95) and a towering ice cream cake ($3.95) with a thick, nostalgic Oreo crust, come adorned with cherries, strawberries, chocolate syrup and whipped cream. Wash them all down with some of the Island's best milk shakes, specifically the strawberry ($4) and banana ($3), made from fresh, ripe fruit. Or cap the meal with a bit of exotica, a very sweet herb juice called horchata.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>India House Bar and Grill, a 75-seat spot serving the cuisine of Northern India, has been doing business at 19 Broadway in Hicksville (516-933-6500) since late May. Specializing in curries, the restaurant is owned by Inderjeet Singh, who also operates the Tandoor Palace on Fulton Street in Manhattan. Mr. Singh, who is also the chef at India House, is offering a $7.95, luncheon buffet seven days a week. Dinner entrees are priced from $7.95 (vegetarian selections) to $13.95 (shrimp vindaloo).</p>
        <p>There are two new Italian restaurants, both in Merrick. The 100-seat Tony &amp; Bruno's has opened at 2095 Merrick Road (516-377-078), where the Boston Market had been. It is the third restaurant in a chain, owned by Sbarro's, of traditional pizzeria restaurants. Tony &amp; Bruno's makes its own sausages and ages its fresh mozzarella.</p>
        <p>Peppo &amp; Lino at 196 Merrick Road (516-377-4369), where the Merrick Marlin had been for 20 years, is a similar operation. The 200-seat Italian grill restaurant offers mainline Italian dishes ($7.95 to $14.95 for entrees).</p>
        <p>Tom Hiyashi, who was a chef at Oyama in Great Neck and Suibi in Manhattan, has opened Nisen, his own Japanese restaurant at 1969 Jericho Turnpike in East Northport (631-462-1000). The 31-seat spot features two special roll menus of 13 cold and nine cooked selections at prices in the $5-to-$13 range.</p>
