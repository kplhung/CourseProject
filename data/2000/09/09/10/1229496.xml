        <p>It's midafternoon in Manahawkin and a hungry shopper at the Kmart Shopping Center steps into Trupia's Italian Pizzeria Restaurant for a slice of pizza and a slice of life. Doo-wop music is on the CD player, old news clippings about the Yankees are on the wall, there's a photograph of Frank Sinatra, and behind the counter, there's a retired New York City policeman in an apron. He's Bob Trupia, who left the force a couple of years ago and brought his Flatbush dreams and family from Brooklyn to the Jersey Shore. Trupia's is a pizzeria in front and a trim Italian restaurant in the back. Mr. Trupia's pizza has Brooklyn flair. There are 20 varieties, from the tried and true (the menu calls them ''New York style'') to the unexpected, like bacon, chicken parmigiana and steak. It is prepared with imported Italian tomatoes and with mozzarella made in the kitchen, and comes by the slice ($1.25 to $1.45) or pie $4.50 for a ''personal'' size to $15 for some Sicilian pies) or stromboli ($4 or $4.50). Where Mr. Trupia truly gives reign to his culinary imagination is in his ''gourmet'' pizzas. One standout is pizza alla vodka, made with mozzarella and vodka cream sauce. He has also immortalized his family in crust by naming pizzas after them. One of them, named for his daughter, is Danielle's Delight, fresh tomatoes, bacon and pepperoni slathered with mozzarella. Sometimes policemen who come in to eat will spot Mr. Tropia's N.Y.P.D. retirement plaque on the wall and introduce themselves. Mr. Trupia will come out and shake their hands. ''It is a bond that never goes away,'' he says, and then it's back behind the counter.</p>
