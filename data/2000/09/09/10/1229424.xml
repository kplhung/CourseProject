        <p>TYPICALLY, small, purple-blue Italian prunes bring up the rear in summer's annual parade of plums. Though less handsome, perhaps, than other plums, they are the ones most often used in cooking. One reason is that they are freestone, making them easily pitted.</p>
        <p>When buying them, look for fruit that yields slightly to pressure but is not soft. Though they're generally small, they can vary, so select plums that are uniform in size.</p>

        <p>TYPICALLY, small, purple-blue Italian prunes bring up the rear in summer's annual parade of plums. Though less handsome, perhaps, than other plums, they are the ones most often used in cooking. One reason is that they are freestone, making them easily pitted.</p>
        <p>When buying them, look for fruit that yields slightly to pressure but is not soft. Though they're generally small, they can vary, so select plums that are uniform in size.</p>
        <p>I love to use them in tarts, cakes, crisps and crumbles. But they're also delicious in place of berries in a late-season version of English summer pudding in which the fruit is softened, sweetened and chilled in a bread-lined bowl, then unmolded.</p>
        <p>I combine them with black figs and blackberries and sweeten them with honey to serve with a soft cheese mixture which can be low-fat or not, depending on the cheese you select.</p>
        <p>And mixed with walnuts they stud a dark quick tea loaf, which, out of season, can be made with pitted prunes instead of fresh plums.</p>
        <p>Summer Pudding With Plums  Total time: 40 minutes Plus overnight chilling</p>
        <p>3 pounds Italian prune plums, pitted and quartered  1 cup sugar</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon  Grated zest of 1 orange</p>
        <p>2/3 cup fresh orange juice  1 pound firm-textured, thin-sliced, white sandwich bread, crusts removed  Whipped cream for serving.</p>
        <p>1. Put plums in a heavy saucepan. Add sugar, cinnamon, orange zest and juice. Bring to simmer and cook, stirring, about five minutes, until sugar has dissolved, mixture is very juicy and plums have softened but still hold their shape. Remove from heat.</p>
        <p>2. Line bottom and sides of six-cup mixing bowl with bread slices, slightly overlapping so there are no gaps. Reserve enough bread to cover the top.</p>
        <p>3. Remove a third of a cup of juice from plum mixture to small bowl, cover and refrigerate. Fill bread-lined bowl with remaining plum mixture and juice. Cover top with reserved bread. Cover with a sheet of plastic wrap that extends down sides of bowl and press it directly onto bread. Select a plate, cake pan or other dish that fits on top of pudding so it sits into the bowl. Weight it down with a can of food, like a big can of tomatoes, or some other heavy object. Put weighted bowl on a plate to catch any overflowing juices and refrigerate overnight.</p>
        <p>4. To serve, run a flexible knife or thin spatula around the inside of bowl and unmold pudding onto a dish with a rim. Use reserved juice to paint any parts of the bread that did not become soaked with juice. Serve with whipped cream.  Yield: 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Plums, Figs and Berries With Cheese  Total time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>1 cup fromage blanc or soft, fresh goat cheese  1 cup plain yogurt or mascarpone</p>
        <p>1/3 cup lavender honey  12 Italian prune plums, pitted and quartered  8 fresh black figs, stems removed, quartered</p>
        <p>1/2 cup blackberries  6 sprigs lavender  12 tuiles or other thin, crisp cookies that are not too sweet.</p>
        <p>1. Mix fromage blanc or goat cheese with yogurt or mascarpone. Sweeten with two tablespoons honey. Refrigerate.</p>
        <p>2. Combine fruit in a bowl. Warm remaining honey in small saucepan, pour over fruit and toss gently.</p>
        <p>3. To serve, put a mound of cheese in center of each of six dessert plates. Surround with fruit. Garnish each with lavender and two cookies.  Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Ouick Bread Of Plums and Walnuts  Total time: 1 hour 45 minutes</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons butter, in pieces, plus butter for pan  2 cups all-purpose flour, plus flour for pan  1 cup light brown sugar  1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt  1 large egg</p>
        <p>3/4 cup prune juice  1 teaspoon orange extract  1 1/2 cups diced pitted Italian prune plums or dried prunes</p>
        <p>3/4 cup chopped walnuts.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour loaf pan measuring 9 by 5 by 3 inches.</p>
        <p>2. Whisk two cups flour with sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in large bowl or briefly whirl in food processor to blend. Add butter, and using a fork in the bowl or pulsing in food processor, blend in until mixture is uniformly crumbly.</p>
        <p>3. Beat egg in small bowl until thick. Stir in prune juice and orange extract, then add to flour mixture, mixing lightly just until ingredients are blended. Fold in plums or prunes and nuts.</p>
        <p>4. Spoon batter into pan. Smooth top. Bake about an hour and 15 minutes, until cake tester comes out clean. Cool on rack before removing from pan.  Yield: 1 large loaf.</p>
