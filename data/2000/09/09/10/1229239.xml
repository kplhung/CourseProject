        <p>This summer about 500 volunteers have been combing the woods, bogs and parks of New Jersey looking for snakes, frogs, salamanders and other crawly things as part of the Herpetology Atlas project of the state Division of Fish and Wildlife. The volunteers have been counting amphibians and reptiles to see what kinds live in the state and where they make their homes. Those interested in volunteering can call (609) 628-2103 or e-mail nongame @nwip.net. Jason Tesauro, assistant biologist with the Division's Endangered and Nongame Species Program, recently discussed the project.</p>
        <p>Q. What is the Herpetology Atlas?</p>
        <p>A. We do not have a good record of what kinds of amphibians and reptiles are living in the wild in New Jersey. The Herpetology Atlas project is designed to gather as much data as possible to see what kinds of herps, as they are called, live here and exactly where their habitats are. We started in 1996 and hope to wrap up in 2002. We think there are 42 reptiles, including turtles, lizards and snakes, and 33 amphibians, such as salamanders and frogs, and 16 of them are endangered or threatened. Both are cold-blooded. Reptiles have scales; amphibians usually begin life in water and do not have scales. This year we shifted into high gear because we got a grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to hire a person to coordinate the project.</p>
        <p>Q. Why does New Jersey need this?</p>
        <p>A. If we do not know what is living in an area, it is impossible to know if we are harming it by allowing development. We don't even know for sure how common some species might have been in the past. With the information we are gathering we can update our critical habitat maps that can be made available to land planners. By having volunteers help we can gather a lot more information than we could if we had to rely just on our staff.</p>
        <p>Q. Who takes part?</p>
        <p>A. The volunteers are all ages and all backgrounds. We get amateur herpetologists and we get people who are complete neophytes. The volunteers are asked to go out several times during an eight-week span and to return to the same area more than once because a series of species can use the same area for mating at different times. We ask that they agree to volunteer about 40 hours, but some people do much more.</p>
        <p>Q. How are the volunteers trained?</p>
        <p>A. They take a one-day course that we give telling them what to look for and where. For the species, like tree frogs and spring peepers, that you hear but don't see, we play a tape for them, which they get to take with them, that has each frog's call on it.</p>
        <p>Q. Where do volunteers search?</p>
        <p>A. The volunteers select their own site of three square miles. If they live in a developed area, it can be a park or some other preserved space -- any place that is not concrete jungle.</p>
        <p>Q. What is the difference between an endangered and a threatened species?</p>
        <p>A. A species that is endangered is one that, if we do not do something, it is likely to be extinct in the state in the near future. A threatened species is one that occurs in small local distribution or that is being hit by a pattern of land use that is taking its habitat. The corn snake is endangered; the bog turtle is endangered, and federally it is threatened, because of the disappearance of its habitat. We have seen from old records that bog turtles used to exist in the entire state. Now it is restricted to the most undeveloped areas of extreme northwestern and extreme southwestern New Jersey. Suburbia wreaks havoc on the bog turtle, which lives in a fragile habitat. It needs pristine ground water.</p>
