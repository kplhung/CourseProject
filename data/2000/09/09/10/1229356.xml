        <p>Allison Jill Dubin, a daughter of Lisa and Daniel Dubin of New York, was married yesterday to James Christopher Tracy, the son of Marie Therese and James Tracy of Palm Springs, Calif. The Rev. Debra Steen Ross, an interfaith minister, officiated at the home of the bride's parents in Hampton Bays, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dubin, who is keeping her name, is a producer with Activate.net, an Internet broadcasting company in New York. She is also a co-founder and co-artistic director, with the bridegroom, of the Momentary Theater, a nonprofit theater company in New York. She graduated from Trinity College in Hartford.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tracy, who is known as Christopher, was until last week the pastry sous-chef at the restaurant March in New York. In October he will begin working as the executive sous-chef at Robbins Wolfe Eventeures, a catering and party-planning company in New York and Bridgehampton, N.Y. He graduated from St. Mary's College in Moraga, Calif., and the French Culinary Institute in New York, and received a certificate from the Sommelier Society of America.</p>
        <p>The postman, so to speak, knocked not just twice, but three times for the couple. They first met in January 1992, while waiting to audition for the Master of Fine Arts program at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>
        <p>''He had this guitar and a ponytail, and I said to myself, 'I'll talk to you,' '' Ms. Dubin remembered. Their 20-minute conversation ended abruptly when she was called in to audition.</p>
        <p>''We hit it off, but parted ways,'' Mr. Tracy said.</p>
        <p>About two months later, they spied each other while auditioning for the Yale Drama School. ''We passed each other in the hall, and it was like 'Oh, hi,' '' Mr. Tracy recalled. ''We spoke for only about five minutes.''</p>
        <p>In September 1992, fate gave them one more chance. Ms. Dubin and Mr. Tracy had enrolled in the same acting training program at the Circle in the Square Theater in New York.</p>
        <p>''I was sitting in the third row; he was in the second on the opposite side of the class,'' Ms. Dubin remembered. ''Our eyes met, and we pointed at each other.''</p>
        <p>The rapport that the two had long suspected might exist suddenly blossomed. They became fast friends, rehearsing scenes together, going to shows together, and dining in New York restaurants.</p>
        <p>''We shared the same curiosity and hunger for things,'' Ms. Dubin said. Recalling their first meeting, she added: ''There was an initial spark, but we were not looking for a date. The third time around, we had the opportunity to let it develop into something more.''</p>
