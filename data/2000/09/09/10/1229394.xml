        <p>WHEN Vice President Al Gore outlined his economic vision for America in a speech in Cleveland last week, he did not even mention health policy. That was quite a change from 1992, when controlling health costs and providing health insurance for all Americans was one of the driving forces of the Clinton-Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Back then the prevailing view was that the rising cost of health care and the failure of many Americans to have medical insurance posed a serious national problem. There was widespread disagreement over how to solve the problem but not over whether it could and should be addressed.</p>
        <p>Today, however, in an era of unrivaled prosperity, when Americans express complete confidence in their ability to handle most economic concerns, the authorities and the public have begun to doubt whether costs for the best medical care can ever be contained, or whether a practical way exists to provide insurance for all citizens.</p>
        <p>In the last year, health costs have risen much faster than the overall rate of inflation or workers' wages. And the only main economic indicator that has actually worsened during the Clinton years is the number of Americans without medical insurance. A study last spring by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation shows that 44 million people, or 18.4 percent of the population, had no insurance in 1998, the last year for which figures were available, up from 38 million people, or 17.5 percent, in 1992.</p>
        <p>The case seems to be that what is economically rational is politically unacceptable. And what is politically possible does not fit with economic realities. People demand the finest doctors, state-of-the-art technology and expensive drugs, no strings attached. But neither they nor their political representatives are willing to pay the price this would entail.</p>
        <p>For a time it was thought that health maintenance organizations were the silver bullet. But the public rebelled against the restrictions they imposed. And once the cost of premiums began to rise, companies began dropping them.</p>
        <p>The political turning point, of course, was the collapse of the mammoth health plan President Clinton offered in 1994. The plan, grounded in large part on H.M.O.'s, was too complicated and ambitious, and fell victim to opposition from the insurance industry and Republicans. It was the worst legislative defeat of the Clinton presidency, and it contributed to the Democrats' loss of control of Congress in the 1994 elections. ''The political fallout from this debacle was staggering,'' said Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution who has advised Democratic politicians on health policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is obviously gun-shy from that defeat. The book-length manifesto he put out with his policy speech in Cleveland last week addresses his health proposals in passing on Page 118 -- including an ambitious and expensive promise to guarantee all children health insurance by 2005. But this was not one of the vice president's top 10 goals -- like encouraging home-ownership or expanding access to college.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas would just as soon skip the issue of health care and avoid further scrutiny of the record in Texas. Thirty-seven percent of low-income children there are uninsured (only Arizona does worse), and a federal judge ruled last month that the state had failed to abide by a 1996 court order to provide appropriate health care for more than 1.5 million children eligible for Medicaid.</p>
        <p>Public opinion on health policy has clearly changed, as well. ''In the last eight years,'' said Robert J. Blendon, an authority at Harvard on health and public opinion, ''people got scared away from big solutions.''</p>
        <p>In 1992, Mr. Blendon said, most people said they would accept a big tax increase in order to guarantee health insurance for all. Now, he said, two-thirds of Americans tell pollsters they would like a government program to make sure people have insurance, but fewer than 40 percent favor a sweeping measure that would require higher taxes. And many people, Mr. Blendon said, are afraid that the government might make matters worse.</p>
        <p>The one health issue that has been joined in the campaign, prescription drug coverage for the elderly, was hardly discussed eight years ago. Since then, however, drug prices have risen by as much as 15 percent a year. Last week, Mr. Bush laid out his plan for subsidies that he said would allow the elderly to buy private insurance to cover drugs. Mr. Gore would give the elderly drug coverage under Medicare.</p>
        <p>A decade ago health maintenance organizations seemed to offer a solution to the health care dilemma. Companies would pay a flat fee per employee; workers could see only the doctors in their particular plan; and primary-care physicians decided what treatment was permitted. In turn, they were rewarded for holding down costs.</p>
        <p>In a Supreme Court decision in June upholding a health plan's right to give doctors a financial incentive to hold down costs, Justice David H. Souter used blunt words to describe the fundamental principle behind H.M.O.'s: ''treatment rationing.''</p>
        <p>H.M.O.'s seemed to work for a time. The rise in health costs slowed. But the public began to complain about all the rules limiting the services they could receive -- about the rationing. Eventually, those complaints grew so widespread that politicians began debating what they called a patients' bill of rights.</p>
        <p>Then the costs began to rise again. Last week, the Kaiser Foundation reported that between the spring of 1999 and the spring of 2000, monthly premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance rose by 8.3 percent, a full 5 percentage points more than the overall national inflation rate and 4 points more than the rise in workers' earnings.</p>
        <p>Now, in increasing numbers, companies are abandoning H.M.O.'s for preferred provider organizations -- doctor networks that agree to reduced rates for their services. They don't have the expensive approval-referral bureaucracy of H.M.O.'s, and they offer a wider range of doctors and relaxed rules about the availability of treatments.</p>
        <p>But there is no particular reason to believe that over the long run P.P.O.'s can offer people the care they want at an acceptable cost. ''Don't be surprised if this bubble pops too,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, who is one of the foremost authorities in Washington on government health policy.</p>
        <p>A major problem with controlling health care costs is that conventional economic principles do not fully apply. Employers want to keep the cost of insurance down to protect their profits. Doctors and hospitals will not perform services at a loss. Drug and insurance companies want the largest profits possible for their shareholders. The less money people pay out of pocket, the more expensive treatments they demand.</p>
        <p>But market forces do not apply to other aspects. Because most bills are picked up by insurance, people pay little attention to the cost of treatment, and they have no way to assess the quality of medical services they receive. Beyond that, for most people, good health is priceless; they are willing to pay whatever it takes for themselves and their families.</p>
        <p>So this is the conundrum for politicians. Their constituents will not accept the rationing of their medical treatment. People do not want to be told that good health has a price. On the other hand, neither the politicians nor their constituents want to pay the higher taxes or higher insurance premiums required for unlimited health care.</p>
        <p>Some day this may be sorted out. But not in this election. The best guess is that matters will get worse sooner rather than later. With the tight job market, many employers are simply swallowing the cost of higher insurance premiums because they cannot risk losing workers. But when the economy turns the slightest bit sour, employers will surely force workers to pay more or even cancel insurance altogether.</p>
        <p>What this means politically is uncertain. But for now, the policy experts and politicians agree, if changes are made, they will be incremental.</p>
        <p>''We are definitely in a transition period,'' said Dr. David A. Kessler, dean of the Yale Medical School. ''But no one knows where we are headed.''</p>
