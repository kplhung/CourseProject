        <p>Nathan Andrews, 13, says playing football makes him feel closer to his friends.</p>
        <p>''They respect you more,'' said Nathan, who for the last year has played for a team affiliated with Pop Warner, a national youth football league. ''You have teamwork together.''</p>
        <p>But this year, Nathan's team may not play any games. After a rift in January left the departing coach with most of the players and the remaining coach with most of the equipment, the team has scrambled to raise money for this season.</p>
        <p>Sammy Jackson, who coaches the breakaway team, called the Panthers, said it could not afford the $15,000 that the necessary equipment would cost. ''We were doing fund-raisers and had a couple of sponsors with the Tigers,'' he said, referring to the team's old incarnation. This year, however, sponsorship has been hard to find for the 100 players and 25 cheerleaders. ''I hate to tell them we're not going to be able to do it for the season,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson said the volunteer organization he runs, East New York Kidspower, joined with another group, Minority Education Sports Advancement, two years ago to form the Tigers. He said the split occurred after Minority Education's head, Paul Knight, refused to tell him or parents where the team's money was coming from and going to.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knight responded that he was open about the finances, most of which, as head coach, he had raised. ''We had coaches' meetings,'' he said. ''Every time an order was placed, they,'' the other coaches,  ''had to know about it.''</p>
        <p>Asked where the money had come from, he emphasized that he had developed those sources and said, ''I'm not going to reveal that information.''</p>
        <p>Currently, Mr. Knight said, several thousand dollars' worth of helmets, jerseys and pads bought last year are in his garage. ''That equipment is mine,'' he said. ''It came out of my funding.''</p>
        <p>But the equipment will lie idle until next year. William Weerth, acting president of New York City Pop Warner Football and Cheerleader, said the Tigers were suspended from the league last fall when some of its players were discovered to be over age, and others lacked the required school certification. Asked about that, Mr. Knight said, ''I'm not the only one who had discrepancies in the Pop Warner league.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Panthers have been admitted to the league on probation. But they have not bought mandatory insurance. Pop Warner arranges referees and scheduling, but teams buy equipment and insurance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson said he planned to pay the $1,500 insurance fee this week. But without equipment, he said, players are discouraged. Only 40 of 100 came to a practice session last week.</p>
        <p>''The first game starts next Saturday,'' he said. ''I'm going to call them and tell them if they don't come out and practice, they're going to get beat.''</p>
