        <p>Below are excerpts from ''Spider's Poem'' by Cori Sherman:</p>
        <p>Today I saw while sitting on my bed</p>
        <p>A spider hanging above my head</p>
        <p>He was hanging from a thread so bare</p>
        <p>I could barely tell the thread was there</p>
        <p>The spider's skin was very black</p>
        <p>And I nearly had a heart attack.</p>
        <p>I went screaming from my room</p>
        <p>'Daddy, Daddy, I'll meet my doom!</p>
        <p>If you don't catch that spider soon!''</p>
        <p>I was making such a fuss</p>
        <p>That my father came to see</p>
        <p>And I showed him the little bug</p>
        <p>That was scaring me.</p>
        <p>My father simply smiled and tried to sit me on his lap</p>
        <p>''No, daddy, no'' I said</p>
        <p>''Why can't you give the spider one crushing little slap?''</p>
        <p>My father looked at me and said with voice real deep</p>
        <p>''Honey, listen to my story and do not make a peep.'</p>
        <p>Spiders build a web where they live and eat all day</p>
        <p>And what they eat is other bugs</p>
        <p>That dare to come my way.</p>
        <p>The spider will not hurt you</p>
        <p>He makes the earth a better place</p>
        <p>And I wish you could see his web</p>
        <p>It's prettier than lace</p>
        <p>You're bigger than the spider</p>
        <p>And he's more scared than you</p>
        <p>I will not slap this spider</p>
        <p>Or crush him with my shoe.</p>
        <p>If it weren't for these little guys</p>
        <p>The world would have too many flies</p>
        <p>So instead of killing the spider why not see him free</p>
        <p>So he can build a web and we can let him be?</p>
        <p>I looked at my dad with wonder</p>
        <p>Because he made me see</p>
        <p>That what I thought was scary</p>
        <p>Was really good for me.</p>
