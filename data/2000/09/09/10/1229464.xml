        <p>Rob Johnson of the Buffalo Bills was taking a beating. By the end of the third quarter in the brutal opener against a hard-hitting Tennessee Titans defense, Johnson had a noticeable limp and looked woozy. It got so bad that some of his teammates on the sideline were saying to each other, ''Better get Flutie ready.''</p>
        <p>Doug Flutie, the 5-foot-9-inch miracle worker, is the backup quarterback, but he is sidelined with a groin injury. There would be no Flutie saving the day.

Johnson nodded, listening.</p>

        <p>Rob Johnson of the Buffalo Bills was taking a beating. By the end of the third quarter in the brutal opener against a hard-hitting Tennessee Titans defense, Johnson had a noticeable limp and looked woozy. It got so bad that some of his teammates on the sideline were saying to each other, ''Better get Flutie ready.''</p>
        <p>Doug Flutie, the 5-foot-9-inch miracle worker, is the backup quarterback, but he is sidelined with a groin injury. There would be no Flutie saving the day. During a timeout, Johnson slowly wobbled toward the sideline. Waiting for him was Flutie, who patted Johnson on the back, and then followed him, consulting, offering advice. Johnson nodded, listening.</p>
        <p>It is a scene repeated numerous times across the National Football League -- a starter and a backup talking about strategy. Except in the case of Johnson and Flutie the scene betrayed reality. The relationship between Johnson and Flutie is as cold as a Buffalo winter. As one teammate put it: ''They tolerate each other, but they don't like each other. They don't talk.''</p>
        <p>The dislike is rooted in the competition between the two, which has been going on for years. Flutie replaced Johnson as the starter several years ago, and then Johnson recently replaced Flutie.</p>
        <p>But their relationship chilled even more after Flutie made some questionable -- and selfish -- comments to a Canadian sports network in the weeks after the Bills' loss to the Titans in the playoffs last season. ''I honestly believe that if I would have been playing, we could have, would have, won,'' Flutie said.</p>
        <p>To say that he would have made the difference shows Flutie's confidence, but also demonstrates his self-centered tendency, something Johnson pointed out in an interview with Penthouse magazine. Asked to respond to Flutie's remarks, Johnson said, in part: ''I think what Flutie said was more of an insult to the entire team. That's just the type of guy Doug is. He's not much fun to play with. You just have to deal with it.''</p>
        <p>The Johnson-Flutie saga is just one of several awkward situations between starting and backup quarterbacks. In Pittsburgh, Kent Graham, the former Giant, is the starter, but it is no secret that Coach Bill Cowher will most likely start Kordell Stewart at some point. The relationship between Graham and Stewart, the starter last season, is cordial.</p>
        <p>With the Jets, there is no controversy because Vinny Testaverde is the entrenched starter, but the backup, Ray Lucas, is extremely unhappy that the team drafted Chad Pennington, and Lucas has made his unhappiness known.</p>
        <p>In San Diego, Ryan Leaf and Jim Harbaugh have a good relationship, but some Chargers believe it will only be a matter of time before Harbaugh starts, especially since few of the players like Leaf. In Cleveland, Tim Couch, the franchise's No. 1 pick, is struggling, and could be replaced by his backup.</p>
        <p>The quarterback situation in Washington is rife with potential for ugliness, even though everyone in the Redskins' organization, including the two throwers themselves, the starter, Brad Johnson, and the backup Jeff George, say there is no acrimony between the two.</p>
        <p>When asked how to avoid keeping things from getting tense, Johnson said: ''It's just being relaxed. Knowing that when you come into meeting rooms, no one is trying to stab each other in the back. It's just being able to see a guy in the hallway and being able to say hello without them trying to duck to the other corner. That makes a big difference. You're not looking for friendship, but it definitely helps.''</p>
        <p>Johnson is extremely competitive, but he also has one of the most pleasant personalities of any player in the league, so that will help the situation. However, Johnson's patience will be tested because George is notorious for his unwillingness to sit on the bench and be quiet. It is not a question of if George will complain about being a backup, but when.</p>
        <p>Flutie can be equally politically incorrect. There has been anti-Flutie talk in the Bills' locker room for more than a year, which first became public when the former Bills wide receiver Andre Reed criticized Flutie for being selfish on Reed's Web site before Reed left the organization.</p>
        <p>When asked about his comments to Penthouse, Johnson recently backed down from his words that Flutie is not much fun as a teammate. ''I said that week it wasn't much fun because he obviously wasn't in a very good mood,'' Johnson said. ''He was doing a lot of complaining and it wasn't good for the team. That week, I did say he wasn't very pleasant to work with.''</p>
        <p>About Flutie's comments being an insult to the team, Johnson said: ''It was insulting to me personally, but as a team you have to feel that there are 21 other guys out there making plays. We're a unit. We're 53 guys. To say one guy would have made the difference? That's what I meant.''</p>
        <p>Currently both players are making nice. But how long will that last?</p>
        <p>Dayne Disputes Fine</p>
        <p>Giants running back Ron Dayne has been fined $10,000 by the league for his unexcused absence at this year's rookie symposium, an N.F.L. official confirmed.</p>
        <p>Dayne has appealed the fine, and a decision on the appeal is pending, the official said.</p>
        <p>Dayne maintained that he missed the symposium because of an ear infection that prevented him from traveling on an airplane. Dayne did not provide the excuse in a timely manner, which led to the fine. The N.F.L. also does not believe Dayne's reason.</p>
        <p>A decision on the appeal should come within the next few weeks.</p>
        <p>Two Grudge Matchups</p>
        <p>When quarterback Akili Smith was passed over by the Cleveland Browns in the 1999 draft in favor of Tim Couch, he made it clear that one day the Browns would regret the decision. In the 2000 draft, Peter Warrick, the Florida State wide receiver, was passed over by the Browns in favor of Courtney Brown, the Penn State defensive lineman. Warrick was also unhappy about being passed over.</p>
        <p>Now, Smith and Warrick play on the same team, the Cincinnati Bengals, and they meet the Browns today, which means they both get a chance to prove just how wrong the Browns may have been. Both tried to play down any bitterness, but what Warrick said earlier this year cannot be erased.</p>
        <p>Warrick predicted the Bengals would be 1-0 after Sept. 10, and since the Bengals had the unusual bye week in Week 1 and play the Browns today, Warrick was obviously saying they would beat the Browns.</p>
        <p>Lesson in Motivation</p>
        <p>Following the 27-14 loss to the Indianapolis Colts last week, Kansas City Chiefs Coach Gunther Cunningham met with his team. According to a coach who was present, an extremely emotional Cunningham basically said that he was going to do everything he could to make sure the team never had a loss like the one to the Colts again. And he said that if he did not get the job done, he would quit and make way for someone else who could.</p>
        <p>From those words came a Fox television report that Cunningham had considered resigning but was dissuaded by his wife. Cunningham said the report took his words out of context.</p>
        <p>Coaches, from the high school level to the pros, say all the time that if they are not getting the job done, they will quit. It is a motivational tactic, a way to get players to fight for them. In an interview with One-on-One Sports Radio Network on Friday, the former Jets Coach Bill Parcells said to some of the teams he had coached the same thing that Cunningham did.</p>
