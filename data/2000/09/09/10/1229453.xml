        <p>President Clinton and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, held brief impromptu talks yesterday at Mr. Barak's hotel in New York, rounding out a week of discussions on the Middle East peace negotiations and the security relationship between the United States and Israel.</p>
        <p>Senior Clinton administration officials have made clear in the last several days that they face an uphill struggle to try to revive the momentum of the Camp David summit meeting of six weeks ago.</p>
        <p>With prospects fading for a peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, Mr. Clinton appears keen to bolster the position of Mr. Barak at home, where the Israeli faces a rambunctious Parliament when it reconvenes in late October and falling support in public-opinion surveys.</p>
        <p>A White House spokesman, P. J. Crowley, said Mr. Clinton, who was leaving New York later yesterday, wanted to say goodbye to Mr. Barak before he returned to Israel and spent about an hour with the prime minister and his wife, Nava. In deference to the Jewish Sabbath, Mr. Clinton went to Mr. Barak's hotel.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, left New York on Friday to return to Gaza to attend the Palestinian Central Council, which is meeting this weekend to consider delaying the date for the declaration of a Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat has suggested that the council would delay the date, now set for Sept. 13. A new date for the declaration may be set for November.</p>
        <p>At a news conference while he was in New York for last week's United Nations summit meeting, Mr. Barak said the delay would be a ''positive'' signal for the Middle East talks.</p>
        <p>A senior aide to Mr. Arafat, Nabil Abu Rdainah, was quoted yesterday by Reuters as saying Palestinian and Israeli negotiators would resume mid-level talks this week. But senior Clinton administration officials, while gratified that the effort has not broken down entirely, did not appear to have much confidence in the renewal of the talks.</p>
        <p>One of the major elements of the Israeli-American talks this week in New York focused on an upgraded security relationship with the United States. For Mr. Barak, that is a vital element in his struggle to stay in office.</p>
        <p>If new elections are held in Israel and there is no peace agreement for Mr. Barak to run on, he must show that after making tentative concessions to the Palestinians, he also won something from the United States.</p>
        <p>The prime minister is under intense criticism from rightist political parties, which say he made too many concessions to the Palestinians at Camp David.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Clinton has said he would like to reward the prime minister for his courage and creativity at Camp David and his willingness to continue the peace effort now.</p>
        <p>If the security relationship is enhanced, it will probably be in the form of increased financial military assistance to Israel.</p>
        <p>This would have run into the billions of dollars if there had been a peace settlement with the Palestinians, but is now likely to be much less, according to administration officials.</p>
        <p>The administration has proposed $250 million more this year, which it would seek to get approved by Congress before it recesses early next month, officials said. The Israelis are saying they need nearly $1 billion, the officials said.</p>
        <p>The proposed change in the formal security relationship would probably also involve a shift to stating that Israel was a ''strategic, major non-NATO ally'' rather than just a ''major non-NATO ally,'' officials said.</p>
        <p>The United States would pledge to ensure that Israel keep its qualitative edge in weapons over the Arab world and that it had access to the technology it needed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak is eager to nail down elements of the security package because some Israeli military experts, including members of his government, have criticized the proposal as being detrimental rather than advantageous.</p>
        <p>The criticism has arisen because the package stipulates that Israel must inform the United States of its arms sales to India, Pakistan, China and Russia, a safeguard that the administration has insisted on as a way of controlling the spread of arms.</p>
        <p>At the start of the Camp David meeting, Mr. Barak canceled a planned sale of a sophisticated radar system, known as Phalcon, to China, a move intended to shore up Israeli support in Congress after American criticism of the deal.</p>
        <p>The Israeli deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, said this week that a formal notification requirement for weapon sales to other countries was unfair and gave the United States a veto over Israel's national interests.</p>
