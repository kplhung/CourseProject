        <p>Even as it confronted lawsuits, Congressional hearings and public anger over its defective tires, Bridgestone/ Firestone got one piece of good news. The Japanese-owned tire maker reached a settlement with the United Steelworkers of America, avoiding a strike by 8,000 workers. Eager to avert a strike during its current crisis, Bridgestone gave most workers raises of at least 15 percent over three years.</p>
        <p>Still the crisis built, as hearings on Capitol Hill led to a release of documents indicating that the tire company and perhaps Ford knew about a pattern of tire failures long before a recall was announced in August, and statistics from a widely used federal database showed that fatal crashes involving Ford Explorers were almost three times as likely to be tire-related as fatal crashes involving other sport utility vehicles.</p>
