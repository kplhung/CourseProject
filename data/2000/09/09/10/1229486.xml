        <p>Msgr. Thomas Leonard remembers the day in 1962 when, inspired and enthusiastic, he celebrated Mass facing the congregation for the first time.</p>
        <p>It was the era of the Second Vatican Council, when the Roman Catholic Church loosened strictures of magisterial authority, while outside church walls, a turbulent world was remaking itself day by day.</p>
        <p>After Vatican II told priests to face their congregations, the priest thought he could see a new church taking shape. He would no longer be heading a spiritual army bound for salvation, but would become part of a congregation striving for holiness. In churches around the world, from the Bronx to Buenos Aires, from Brooklyn to Bombay, the council did away with communion rails and other borders, and told priests to interpret the Gospels as a call to social action. They fought for integration and school decentralization, built housing for the poor, and spoke out on issues like nuclear disarmament and the Vietnam War.</p>
        <p>But today, as the priests who first embraced Vatican II prepare for retirement, they fear replacement by a generation that does not seem to share their values. The older generation moves with self-doubt and a measure of disillusionment. While the evidence of their advocacy still stands -- in working-class apartments, in youth centers and in revitalized urban neighborhoods -- their social values no longer resonate as strongly among many younger, more conservative priests. As the aging priests turn to pass the torch to the next generation, many of the men who are taking it up seem like strangers to them. The younger, conservative generation is more interested in sacramental matters and issues of faith, and less moved by secular calls for social justice, surveys show.</p>
        <p>''For us, of our generation, there's a real sadness,'' said the Rev. Peter Gavigan, pastor of Our Lady of Victory Roman Catholic Church in the South Bronx, who was ordained in 1965. ''We're a vanishing breed, and we're saying, 'Wow.' We thought it would be a golden age by now.''</p>
        <p>In Brooklyn, Msgr. John J. Powis finds the change painful. ''There's even a feeling they're just waiting for us to go,'' said Monsignor Powis, whose life in the church has included community organizing for many improvements, including subsidized housing and street lights in Brownsville and Bushwick, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The dismay is not limited to New York, and does not arise only from the return to traditionalism embraced by incoming priests. Rather, older priests see their bedrock beliefs doubted by the Vatican itself. While Pope John Paul II has spoken out loudly and often in support of human rights, he has also steadily held the line on innovations begun by the Second Vatican Council, and has selected cardinals from among his most conservative priests. The uneasiness of the Vatican II priests grew in recent weeks as the beatification of Pope Pius IX, who ordered Jews confined to Rome's ghetto and  had a Jewish child abducted to be raised as a Catholic, advanced in step with that of John XXIII, father of Vatican II.</p>
        <p>The council, which met from 1962 to 1965, ushered in a raft of changes aimed at making the Catholic Church more accessible to the faithful and more attuned to secular life. Its 16 documents gave lay people a role in running parishes, replaced the Latin used at Mass with neighborhood languages, and gave priests a voice in church matters. Vatican II identified social justice as an integral part of the church's mission and reversed the church's age-old insistence that Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus. It said Catholicism did not represent the only path to salvation, a groundbreaking statement that the Vatican has publicly started to reconsider in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>In his 1987 book, ''Dreaming About the Church'' (Sheed &amp; Ward), the Rev. Walbert Buhlmann, the former secretary general of Capuchin missions in Rome, wrote that Vatican II once seemed ''to trace out a whole new future for the church.''</p>
        <p>''Why hasn't the promise been kept?'' Father Buhlmann asked. ''Can we ignore the current mood of disenchantment and resignation, or can we come to terms with it?''</p>
        <p>In a confidential letter written in March, the archbishop of Milwaukee, Rembert G. Weakland, prepared his 400 priests for the conservative successor he expects after he retires. ''It seems that we are now coming to a period of more uniformity, less creativity and less space for personal preferences,'' said the archbishop, whose letter was obtained and published by the National Catholic Reporter, a lay weekly.</p>
        <p>The archbishop suggested that the retrenchment answered the yearnings of Catholics today. ''The younger generation needs more structures, clarity and guidance,'' he wrote.  ''For those who put their heart and total energy into the implementation of Vatican Council II, this new period might seem sterile and empty. I hope and pray not.''</p>
        <p>Under the church's retirement system, priests are permitted to retire at 75 with full benefits, and to leave at 70 for reasons of poor health and stay after 75 to meet emergency staffing needs.</p>
        <p>According to periodic nationwide surveys of thousands of priests by  Dean R. Hoge, a professor at Catholic University in Washington working at the National Opinion Research Center in Chicago, since the 1980's the priesthood has grown increasingly conservative on theological questions like celibacy in the priesthood and the ordination of women. Dr. Hoge's research shows that the youngest and oldest priests share similar views, while the generation of Vatican II stands isolated between them.</p>
        <p>In a 1995 article, Dr. Hoge predicted a priesthood that would see itself as a professional class and would be ''smaller in numbers, more conservative in ecclesiology, more pressured by leadership responsibilities.''</p>
        <p>Sister Katarina Schuth, a sociologist at St. Paul Seminary School of Divinity in Minnesota who surveyed faculty members and students at 42 seminaries last year, found important differences between today's seminarians and those of earlier years. Nearly half the schools' 2,300 students had converted from another religion or returned to Catholicism  after leaving their faith. English was a second language for one in four.</p>
        <p>These factors contribute to the conservatism of many young priests. Sister Schuth said.</p>
        <p>She said only about 10 percent of seminarians were extremely conservative, but their influence far outweighed their numbers, largely because they tend to have the support of bishops. Sister Schuth quoted one longtime priest who had told her, ''Only in these past few years is the word of first-year theologian taken to be more credible than mine.''</p>
        <p>In their gloomiest moments, aging priests consider Vatican II not so much the dawn of a more open, inclusive church, but an anomalous thunderbolt of progressivism sandwiched between a past and future that recoil from change and unfettered debate.</p>
        <p>When Msgr. Harry J. Byrne was chancellor of the New York Archdiocese and chairman of its Social Justice Task Force in the 1960's, he prepared guidelines calling on priests to work for social change. ''Constructive activity in the secular community,'' the task force said, ''is not an 'extra' for priests in parishes, but an essential part of their ministry.''</p>
        <p>Now, priests trained in political advocacy toil largely behind the scenes, counting themselves lucky to have any support from their bishops. Others work with immigrants or the poor, and instead of challenging systems they find other ways to help people individually, like giving out sandwiches. As they discuss their disappointments over the years, most express fear of appearing bitter or defiant in print.</p>
        <p>Monsignor Byrne, now retired, lives in an Upper East Side high-rise building, the same building that was built with federal and local housing funds in the 1960's in a project that he organized and oversaw. Each Tuesday night, he dines with a group of other retired priests, who share no illusions that their values still hold sway.</p>
        <p>''The newer priests don't want to work in the inner cities,'' Monsignor Byrne said. ''They like nice clean white cuffs, pressed surplices.'' He and his friends also worry about the small number of young men who are joining the priesthood. In his day, dozens completed seminary each spring. Now, annual ordinations for the New York Archdiocese can be counted on the fingers of one hand. (It is the second-largest archdiocese in the country, with 2.4 million parishioners.)</p>
        <p>Because their numbers are so few, Msgr. Vincent Fullam, rector of the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y., considers men who choose the priesthood these days ''heroic, or the next thing to it.''</p>
        <p>And Sister Schuth said her study had found that ''the majority of seminarians see their role as very much spiritual, celebrating the Eucharist, praying with people, administering the sacraments.'' When this generation talks about straightening out the world, she added, it means bringing Catholics who are ''off base'' into line.</p>
        <p>A number of aging clerics, like Msgr. Philip J. Murnion, wonder what went wrong. In 1968, he wrote a daring report calling on the New York Archdiocese to open its financial books and to give priests and lay Catholics a greater say in decision-making. Supported by more than 500 priests, the report compared discontent with the church to a brewing revolution. But he now thinks his generation may have moved too far, too fast.</p>
        <p>''In our desire to extend the meaning of the sacred, did we end up with a situation in which nothing is sacred?'' asked Monsignor Murnion, who heads the National Pastoral Life Center in New York, a research office for the Catholic Church. Today, he said, redemption is what happens to food stamps, and Madonna is a rock star.</p>
        <p>Today's generation, Monsignor Murnion contended, ''came out feeling nothing but options, so they're seeking boundaries.'' In 1972, Monsignor Murnion's doctoral dissertation compared the beliefs of priests his age with those ordained in the 1920's, an age of conformity. He said he considered today's younger priests spiritually closer to that pre-Vatican II generation than to his own.</p>
        <p>Father Gavigan compares his disappointment to Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's five stages of grief, and finds comfort in his work with lay Catholics and in organizing his community. Others say they find solace in modest victories and in faith.</p>
        <p>''We didn't give up,'' said the Rev. Ramon Gaitan, 66, pastor of Our Lady of Guadelupe, a Chicano church in Santa Ana, Calif. ''We just felt if we couldn't do much to create change nationally, at least we could see things change where we live.''</p>
