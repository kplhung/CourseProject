        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton was the belle of New York City's somewhat belated Labor Day parade yesterday, just as union leaders had planned.</p>
        <p>As tens of thousands of union members marched up Fifth Avenue, to the accompaniment of salsa bands and bagpipes, many marchers and union leaders hailed Mrs. Clinton as a friend of working families. And Mrs. Clinton, taking advantage of having the political platform to herself -- parade organizers did not invite her Republican Senate opponent, Rick A. Lazio, to march -- attacked Mr. Lazio with gusto, pointing to his voting record in Congress in an attempt to portray him as hostile to union members.</p>
        <p>''He keeps telling people they should vote for him because of where he was born, where he grew up, where he clammed, where he went to school,'' she said at a pre-parade breakfast yesterday morning. ''Well, apparently he didn't learn very much about the history and tradition of the progressive labor movement in his state.</p>
        <p>''Those are fundamental differences between us, and I happen to be on the side of working men and women,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Lazio spent the day campaigning at a shopping center in Commack, on Long Island, and another in Howard Beach, Queens. He also attended a street fair in Richmond Hill, Queens. At his side was Assemblyman Anthony S. Seminerio, a Queens Democrat who has a history of supporting Republicans, and who said yesterday that he was backing Mr. Lazio this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio strenuously defended his record on labor issues, and his aides asserted that the support offered for Mrs. Clinton by union leaders did not necessarily reflect the sentiment of the rank and file.</p>
        <p>''I have a good labor record,'' he declared.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said he had voted for the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, and for a ban on corporations' using nonunion replacements during strikes. ''In construction, we put thousands of Long Islanders back to work on projects that I delivered back for the district, so I'm proud of my labor record,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Two unions that have endorsed Mr. Lazio, the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and the New York City Corrections Officers' Benevolent Association, marched in the parade, which stretched from 44th to 72nd Streets. Officials with the New York City Central Labor Council estimated that more than 200,000 marched, although there was no official police count. While there were many onlookers near Rockefeller Center, for many blocks north of 62nd Street, hardly any people were watching from the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>The Labor Day parade has become a showcase for Democratic politicians in recent years, and Mrs. Clinton sought to make the most of it. Along the parade route, she received only mild cheers and a few jeers -- ''Go home, Hillary!'' -- from onlookers, who stood on the sidewalk behind police barricades. After she walked the route, she returned, by motorcade, 20 blocks to the staging area, where thousands of workers were still waiting to join the parade. They broke into applause and chants when they spotted Mrs. Clinton coming down the street, clamoring to shake her hand and asking for autographs and pictures.</p>
        <p>''I like Hillary,'' said Manfred Spikereit, who was among a group of 100 members of an electrical workers' union who rode motorcycles in the parade. ''She's pro-union. I like what she stands for, and I like how she loosened up in recent months.''</p>
        <p>Still, as Mrs. Clinton worked her way along 45th Street, scattered shouts of ''Lazio'' could be heard. And opposite the Plaza Hotel, Rusty Staples, a retiree from Manhattan, booed at her approach. ''I don't think I'll vote for her,'' Ms. Staples said. ''I don't have any respect for her. I'm tired of all the Clintons' lies.''</p>
        <p>Ronnie Arlotta, a transit officer from Queens, spoke warmly of Mr. Lazio, noting that Mrs. Clinton did not live in this state before this year. ''Lazio is not a Johnny-come-lately,'' Mr. Arlotta said. ''He's a real New Yorker. He knows the problems of New York.''</p>
        <p>If nothing else, the enthusiasm union leaders orchestrated for the first lady throughout the day showed that they planned to mount a full-scale campaign and get-out-the-vote effort for her this fall. Several unions had placards printed, reading, ''Labor for Hillary.''</p>
        <p>In publicizing the parade, Randi Weingarten, its chairwoman and the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said one of its main themes was that nearly 300,000 New York City municipal workers want a contract soon.</p>
        <p>At the march, there was a sea of teachers wearing bright red T-shirts, while thousands of members of District Council 37, the giant municipal workers' union, wore green T-shirts. The backs of all their shirts said, ''We all deserve respect and a fair raise.''</p>
        <p>To showcase the first lady, the Central Labor Council, which sponsored the parade, also did not invite Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, even though mayors are traditionally invited and walk at the front.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton walked in the front line, sandwiched between John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and Brian McLaughlin, president of the labor council.</p>
        <p>When Mrs. Clinton and others in the front line reached St. Patrick's Cathedral, at 50th Street, the new leader of the Archdiocese of New York, Archbishop Edward M. Egan, welcomed them.</p>
        <p>The first lady, Mr. Sweeney and Mr. McLaughlin delayed the parade's progress as they talked amiably with the archbishop for a few minutes. In welcoming the parade, the archbishop carried out a tradition that his predecessor, the late Cardinal John O'Connor, was known for.</p>
        <p>''I'm here because of the laboring men and women of greater New York,'' Archbishop Egan said in an interview. ''I'm not here for any political reasons.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, the labor council has scheduled the parade for the Saturday after Labor Day. Union leaders decided to stop holding the parade on its traditional Monday because so many union members did not want their three-day weekends cut short for the march.</p>
        <p>In addition, union leaders were unhappy that on Labor Day, Manhattan's streets were largely empty, with few onlookers to be impressed by labor's show of strength.</p>
        <p>All sorts of groups and candidates seized on the parade to promote their causes. Green Party members distributed leaflets for their presidential candidate, Ralph Nader, while several marchers held placards reading ''Hevesi for Mayor in 2001'' -- a reference to the ambitions of the city's comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi. Hundreds of members of the Sheet Metal Workers' Union carried signs saying, ''Working Families for Gore,'' although bystanders had a sign saying, ''Pro-Labor, Pro-Life, No Gore.''</p>
        <p>Workers who have been on strike against Domino Sugar in Brooklyn marched, as did hundreds of members of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which are striking the advertising industry.</p>
