        <p>Cushioned by a growing surplus, Congress is poised to approve large increases in spending by federal agencies, pushing the national budget to record levels.</p>
        <p>Top-ranking Republicans predict that the perennial year-end wrangling between Congress and the White House will result in a federal budget for the 2001 fiscal year that allocates at least $614 billion, and probably quite a bit more, for discretionary spending.</p>
        <p>That figure would represent a 5 percent increase over the $586 billion Congress approved last year after a heated debate with the Clinton administration that delayed final approval of the last spending bills until Nov. 19, seven weeks after the beginning of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>The figure would also exceed the nearly $600 billion Congress set in April as a ceiling for discretionary spending for the coming fiscal year. Discretionary spending includes everything in the budget except the automatic payments for items like Social Security benefits and interest payments on the national debt.</p>
        <p>''I think everyone recognizes that we're going to have to lift the budget caps,'' as the limits on discretionary spending are known, said Senator Ted Stevens, a Republican of Alaska who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>
        <p>The widespread view among Congressional Republicans that federal spending will rise significantly in the next budget is causing disquiet among the party's more conservative fiscal hawks. Some of them console themselves by pointing out that the increases are taking place during a time of federal budget surpluses rather than deficits.</p>
        <p>The increase in spending is brought on not only by the anticipated surplus, but also by pressures from the White House to agree to some of its priorities as a condition for letting members of Congress leave town for the campaign, and by the demands of individual lawmakers on their leaders for some fiscal bacon to take home to their districts.</p>
        <p>A $288 billion measure for the military that includes a 3.7 percent pay raise for American soldiers, sailors and aviators has already been approved by Congress and signed by President Clinton, putting Congress well along the path to exceeding the $600 billion mark.</p>
        <p>Those bills that are left would pay for foreign aid and domestic, non-military items -- everything from the federal courts, air traffic control radars and interstate highways, to schools, the Head Start program, veterans' hospitals, water treatment plants, national parks and the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>
        <p>Since the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 these items have prompted down-to-the wire fights between Congress and the administration, and, in 1995, the brief shutdown of the government, an action that inflicted grave political wounds on Congressional Republicans.</p>
        <p>The fact that many Republicans are supporting expanded federal spending illustrates how the blossoming surplus and the desire to maintain the fragile majority in Congress have eroded the Republicans' traditional fiscal restraints.</p>
        <p>''The era of relative fiscal conservatism that the Reagan folks tried to implement is over,'' said Stanley E. Collender, a managing director of the Federal Budget Consulting Group at Fleischman-Hillard, a public relations company.</p>
        <p>Last year, Congress approved a  budget that technically was within spending ceilings mandated by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. But the lawmakers were able to stay under the ceilings only by declaring $24 billion in spending for items like the financing of the 2000 Census to be emergencies and not subject to the law's restrictions.</p>
        <p>This year, however, Congress appears to be ready to dispense with such gimmicks and unabashedly approve large spending increases.</p>
        <p>''The caps are irrelevant,'' said Senator Slade Gorton, a Republican from Washington State who is chairman of the Interior Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee. ''Nobody pays any attention to them anymore.''</p>
        <p>This year's tussle will focus on a few major spending bills and the battles will be as much over how the money is spent as how much is allocated. Also, some fights will be over legislative language known as riders that are attached to spending bills.</p>
        <p>Some of the most notable battles will be fought over these bills:</p>
        <p>* The Labor-Health and Human Services bill: Always one of the most contentious of the spending measures, this year's version will involve a fight over Mr. Clinton's proposal to provide $1.3 billion for school repairs and $1.8 billion for the president's seven-year program to hire 100,000 teachers. Congress wants to spend less on both initiatives and give school boards the option of spending the money for other purposes.</p>
        <p>* The Interior bill: Versions passed by the Senate and the House are at least $1 billion less than Mr. Clinton requested. Also the House version provides only $184 million --  far less than the $600 million Mr. Clinton wants -- for the ''Lands Legacy'' program, which allows the government to purchase and protect environmentally sensitive land.</p>
        <p>* The Foreign Operations bill: This $13.3 billion foreign aid bill will feature the perennial fight over whether the government can finance international family planning organizations that use their own money to perform abortions in foreign countries or lobby foreign governments on abortion policy.</p>
        <p>With Democrats needing only seven seats to gain control of the House and with a sense that even their Senate majority is threatened, Republicans are eager to reach quick agreement with Mr. Clinton over the spending bills so that they can return to campaign for re-election.</p>
        <p>The pressure could well bring Congressional leaders to accept spending increases in negotiations with the White House, some Republicans say.</p>
        <p>''We know Clinton's going to want more money,'' said Representative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois. ''It's just a matter of what's the amount. I don't even know if we're going to ask him how he's going to spend it. It's, 'How much do you want?' ''</p>
        <p>At a meeting on Thursday, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert told his Republican colleagues that they should be prepared to loosen the purse strings when it comes to the 11 spending bills Congress still must approve to keep the government running, said several people who attended the session.</p>
        <p>As he left the meeting, however, Mr. Hastert was noncommittal over how much spending Republicans would be willing to support, or if they would support any increase at all.</p>
        <p>''We haven't made that decision yet,'' Mr. Hastert said.</p>
        <p>Discussions between White House and Congressional staffers on the spending bills will begin on Monday, said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official stressed that the two sides would merely ''catalog the list of things that needed to be addressed,'' and would not engage in substantive negotiations.</p>
        <p>Republicans are deeply worried that they will be drawn into protracted debates with the White House.  Since the government shutdown in 1995, many say that the White House has gained political leverage and could keep upping the ante.</p>
        <p>''After the White House won in '95, they knew they had gained the upper hand,'' said a Congressional staff member involved in the budget process. ''The White House knew that any government shutdown would be blamed on the Republicans. So they no longer had any desire to compromise.''</p>
        <p>But Republican leaders worry that if they give in to the higher levels of spending that are requested by the White House, they will be deluged by requests from many of their own members -- especially those locked in tight re-election races -- to finance their pet projects.</p>
        <p>''I get handed letters every day with more and requests from members,'' said Representative C. W. Young, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. The longer the process is played out, Mr. Young added, the more requests he will get.</p>
        <p>The prospect of further demands for increases from the White House and other members of Congress leads some Republicans to predict that the final budget for discretionary spending will even exceed what the administration originally sought.</p>
        <p>''The president wanted $621 billion. It will be much higher than that,'' said Representative John E. Porter, an Illinois Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee that provides money for the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education departments.</p>
