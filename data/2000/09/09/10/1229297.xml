        <p>In the world of reggae, you can't get more real than Frederick (Toots) Hibbert, who is credited with coining the term reggae. Now celebrating his 34th year in the business, Toots and the Maytals, will make their way from Kingston, Jamaica, to the Jersey Shore.</p>
        <p>Often compared with Otis Redding because of his soulful vocals, Toots led his band of fine harmonizers through several musical incarnations of the now-popular shuffling, reggae sound. Obvious in his music are the blues, gospel, soul, ska and R&amp;B roots that have combined to create the distinctive mix the popular genre has become.</p>

        <p>These are new Maytals, but the sound is pure Jamaican. Toots and the Maytals will perform at Joey Harrison's Surf Club in Ortley Beach.</p>
