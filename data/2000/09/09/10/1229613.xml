        <p>Buildings</p>
        <p>September</p>
        <p>HALL OF JUSTICE, NANTES, FRANCE  Jean Nouvel. A civil and criminal courts building by the architect of the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art in Paris.</p>
        <p>HELMUT LANG PARFUMERIE, NEW YORK; GAGOSIAN GALLERY, NEW YORK  Gluckman Mayner Architects. The scent of art. The first in a quintet of new interiors designed by Richard Gluckman, the art world's favorite architect of contemplative space. New galleries for Mary Boone, Charles Cowles and the Philadelphia Museum of Art are scheduled to open in October. Monacelli Press has just published the first monograph on Mr. Gluckman's work, with an essay by Hal Foster.</p>
        <p>October</p>
        <p>STEALTH BUILDING, CULVER CITY, LOS ANGELES  Eric Owen Moss. The latest increment in his postindustrial village.</p>
        <p>TANG TEACHING MUSEUM AND ART GALLERY, SKIDMORE COLLEGE, SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y.  Antoine Predock. The Tang will emphasize the interaction of older and electronic media in a building with wings that redefine the landscape.</p>
        <p>UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE AND FEDERAL BUILDING, ISLIP, N.Y.  Richard Meier. Oyez, oyez. Justice for Meier. The first of two Meier-designed buildings scheduled to open this month. A time for reappraisal after the commission of the century achievement of the Getty Center.</p>
        <p>HUDSON, NEW YORK  Philippe Starck. Ian Schrager's latest oasis of style, at 356 West 58th Street, features a year-round private garden -- a Gramercy Park for transients -- furnished with over-scaled, Alice in Wonderlandish tools. Guest rooms will feature bedside lamps with shades painted by Francesco Clemente.</p>
        <p>SCANDINAVIA HOUSE, NEW YORK  James Stewart Polshek. High design and fish-ball soup. The new headquarters and galleries for the American-Scandinavian Foundation, at 58 Park Avenue, opens with ''Nordic Design: The Generation X.''</p>
        <p>November</p>
        <p>INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY, NEW YORK  Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates. An expansion and renovation of the only art museum in the New Times Square, at 1133 Avenue of the Americas and 43rd Street.</p>
        <p>December</p>
        <p>TERMINUS HOENHEIM-NORD, STRASBOURG, FRANCE  Zaha Hadid. A tramway station and parking for 800 cars, part of the city's new Line B.</p>
        <p>BELLEVUE ART MUSEUM, BELLEVUE, WASH.  Steven Holl. A street fair that morphed into a museum, the design features outdoor terraces and circuitous circulation through the system. The museum, which will have no permanent collection, is described by its director, Diane Douglas, as an intersection between art, science and technology.</p>
        <p>January</p>
        <p>STUDENT ARTS CENTER, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, BALTIMORE  Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. Designed to bring art into an environment dedicated to science, the Student Arts Center creates a new campus landscape with courtyards, paths and views.</p>
        <p>DG BANK BUILDING, BERLIN  Frank Gehry. The one with the horse-head conference room in the middle.</p>
        <p>BASS MUSEUM OF ART, MIAMI BEACH  Arata Isozaki. The centerpiece of a new cultural complex on Collins Avenue at 21st Street that includes a new theater by Arquitectonica and a library by Robert A. M. Stern.</p>
        <p>April</p>

        <p>TRUMP WORLD TOWER, NEW YORK  Costas Kondylis. Let's give 'em something to talk about. The 70-story building rising near the United Nations on First Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets purportedly compelled City Hall to propose new zoning restrictions on the height of skyscrapers. But Donald Trump's latest deal may turn out to be a transitional building between the great glass skyscrapers of the 1960's and the next generation of tall buildings that will rise when New York overcomes its present affliction with vertigo.</p>
        <p>MAY</p>
        <p>MILWAUKEE ART MUSEUM  The first built project in the United States by the Spaniard Santiago Calatrava, the world's pre-eminent architect-engineer, is an addition to a museum housed in buildings by Eero Saarinen and David Kahler. A companion exhibition will be held in Dallas at the Meadows Museum, Southern Methodist University, opening in March.</p>
        <p>MEDIAPARK BLOCK 1, COLOGNE, GERMANY  Jean Nouvel. A mixed-use building complex incorporating housing, schools, hotels, offices and shops.</p>
        <p>INTERNATIONAL ARRIVALS BUILDING, KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NEW YORK  Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. Air travel will continue to be hopeless in our lifetimes -- neither the government nor the airlines care one whit about our comfort -- but at least the moving platforms in this building will offer an installation by Diller and Scofidio featuring panels with lenticular screens.</p>
        <p>June</p>
        <p>MEDIATHEQUE, SENDAI, JAPAN  Toyo Ito. This long-awaited project explores the prospects for public space in an era dominated by communications technology.</p>
        <p>July</p>
        <p>PRADA, SOHO, NEW YORK  Rem Koolhaas. The Pritzker Prize winner, author of ''The Harvard Guide to Shopping'' and rumored co-star (with Matt Damon) of a forthcoming major motion picture, reveals the deeper mysteries of the upscale retail experience.</p>
