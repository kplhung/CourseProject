        <p>MAGNESIUM white by day, coral red by night, the letters P S F S float over Center City as they have for 68 years. But they no longer mark the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society.</p>
        <p>Instead, they signify Loews Philadelphia Hotel, the newest in a chain run by the Tisch family of New York. Loews took an aesthetically pioneering but economically obsolete 36-story office tower and, at the cost of $115 million, turned it into a 583-room hotel, preserving much of its cool, serene International style character.</p>
        <p>Loews is in good company. Any number of landmark office buildings around the country are becoming hotels. In New York, Philip Pilevsky is turning the American Radiator Building, 40 West 40th Street, into the 130-room Bryant Park, which will open in late October. A week later, the Guardian Life Building at 201 Park Avenue South will be reborn as the 270-room W New York-Union Square, developed by the Related Companies and operated by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide.</p>
        <p>The appeal of such conversions is obvious. Beleaguered or abandoned landmarks are returned to economic use, enlivening  surroundings that are often undergoing a renaissance of their own. Sumptuous spaces, tattered and long neglected, are  opened again to the public. And rather than struggle to create a distinctive presence, hotel operators can slip into the identity of well-loved civic icons.</p>
        <p>These developments, however, are not for the faint of heart. Or the formula-minded. Although projects may qualify for historic tax credits covering up to 20 percent of eligible costs, the expense is substantial of retrofitting a structure that was never meant to lodge overnight visitors. And winning approval from federal and local preservation authorities adds time and unpredictability to the process.</p>
        <p>Much of the money goes into engineering that guests will never see, though they will pay for it. (Room rates at W will run from the upper $300's to the lower $400's and start at $500 at the Bryant Park. At the Loews, which is geared to group travel, the rates average $170 to $180 a night.)</p>
        <p>Among the intrinsic problems in converting an office building are plumbing risers, which are typically concentrated at the core of the structure to serve common restrooms. Hotels need plumbing for each guest bathroom, requiring many new risers to be opened throughout the building.</p>
        <p>Another headache is the spacing of window bays, which typically do not correspond to a standard 12-  or 13-foot hotel module, forcing the creation of larger-than-normal room sizes and unusual layouts that please guests but confound efficient, standardized operation.</p>
        <p>And yet, as in the case of the Bryant Park, how else would a hotelier find a building designed by Raymond M. Hood (the McGraw-Hill Building on West 42nd Street, the Daily News Building on East 42nd Street and Tribune Tower in Chicago were among his other commissions) and depicted by Georgia O'Keeffe? ''We're creating a landmark in a landmark,'' said Mr. Pilevsky, chairman and chief executive of the Philips Hotel Group.</p>
        <p>It has taken a lot of money to do so, about $50 million, although the 24-story tower came somewhat cheap: $15 million.</p>
        <p>As striking today as it was on completion in 1924, the American Radiator Building is like a stalagmite of gold-trimmed ebony; black bricks fired in manganese, topped by shimmering finials. It caught the eye of Mr. Pilevsky, whose office is only two blocks away. During the 1980's, he had been a partner in the innovative Morgans, Paramount and Royalton hotels. When the American Radiator Building came up for sale in 1998, he bought it.</p>
        <p>The Bryant Park, designed by David Chipperfield Architects of London, is to be the first in the new Philips Hotel Group, which will include hotels in Miami Beach and Great Neck, N.Y. The chief operating officer is Robert P. Colombo, former senior vice president of Fairmont Hotels, in which role he managed the Plaza Hotel.</p>
        <p>Because the Bryant Park will cater to the entertainment industry, it has a 73-seat sub-basement screening room. This was created by digging 45 feet into bedrock, a task rendered especially difficult because the water table in the vicinity is quite high, displaced by the subterranean stacks of the New York Public Library, stretching beneath Bryant Park itself, across 40th Street.</p>
        <p>''We had to incorporate a series of pumps and all kinds of underground drainage systems in order to have a movie theater and not a swimming pool,'' said Constantine Fotos, the project manager. Mr. Pilevsky said the excavation contributed to the seven-month delay in opening.</p>
        <p>IN another significant structural alteration, the passenger elevator shafts were extended the full height of the building. Originally, they ran only to 16. Passengers bound for higher floors had to transfer to another elevator. Clearly, this would not do for guests paying $500 a night.</p>
        <p>American Standard Companies, formed by a merger in 1929 of American Radiator and the Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company, is now based in Piscataway, N.J. But it will play a small role at the Bryant Park. Guest bathrooms have custom-designed sinks made in Italy by Ideal Standard, a division of American Standard. ''It's only appropriate that they come back as an element in the building,'' Mr. Fotos said.</p>
        <p>Even as Mr. Pilevsky prepares to open the Bryant Park, he said the demand for office space would make such a conversion less likely in the future. With annual office rents of $50 to $60 a square foot, he said, ''it doesn't pay to make this a hotel.''</p>
        <p>When the Related Companies went to contract two years ago on Guardian Life, it envisioned condominium apartments, said Jeff T. Blau, the president. But it concluded that a hotel would be the best use for the property and brought in Starwood, a giant whose brands include Sheraton, Westin and W, a two-year-old business boutique line.</p>
        <p>Related paid $45 million for the 20-story landmark tower at Park Avenue South and 17th Street and an adjacent, modern three-story annex, which it has since net leased to MarchFirst, an Internet company. Guardian moved to 7 Hanover Square in 1999.</p>
        <p>Under the $100 million makeover of the Union Square building, the ground-floor interiors are being recreated with offbeat touches like topiary columns that change seasonally and a front desk covered in grass. ''Our concept was to try to pull the park into the lobby,'' said Edmond Bakos, a principal at the Rockwell Group, which is designing the renovation with Brennan Beer Gorman and the Starwood Design Group.</p>
        <p>Some spaces were too good to alter. On the second floor is an imposing hall, two stories high, 66 feet long and 35 feet wide, where the public once bought insurance. It is to become the ballroom of the W. ''What's better designed for a hotel?'' asked Brad Wilson, the general manager. ''It's exactly how you'd program a hotel, but with details that you could never afford to put in.''</p>
        <p>These details include decorative ligatures with the initials GLIC; not for Guardian Life but for the Germania Life Insurance Company, which built the tower as its headquarters in 1911, to designs by D'Oench &amp; Yost. (The company renamed itself Guardian in 1917 -- ''Germania'' was not exactly a public-relations plus during World War I -- but, of course, it did not have to change any of the ornamental initials.)</p>
        <p>The grand hall, which served as the company cafeteria in recent years, is ringed by a dozen richly veined marble pilasters and columns, as thick as oak trees, under a deeply coffered ceiling with 105 wreath-encircled light fixtures. ''The room just screams, 'Wedding,' '' Mr. Wilson said, both to parents who want the soigne ambiance of the Pierre and to young couples looking for a slightly hipper locale.</p>
        <p>The preservation of the ballroom's clear span posed a challenge to the designers, since the new risers serving the floors above had to be redirected around the space. Apart from that, the guest rooms generally fit well into the existing tower. ''It wasn't a perfect layout but it was a lot easier than we thought it would be,'' said Guy Hensley, the vice president of operations for W Hotels.</p>
        <p>The conversion got off on the wrong foot in January with preservation-minded neighbors when crews began dismantling the red neon sign atop the four-story mansard roof without the city's permission. The work was halted for a time, leaving a truncated version -- ''Guardian Li '' -- on the skyline.</p>
        <p>The Landmarks Preservation Commission later approved a plan to replace the sign with one reading ''W Union Square'' in the same size, color and typeface. ''The proposed signage change, essentially a substitution of one corporate name for another, would not alter the character of the building,'' the commission concluded.</p>
        <p>Jonathan M. Tisch, president and chief executive of Loews Hotels, faced a similar issue with the 27-foot-high sign atop the PSFS tower at Market and 12th Streets, two blocks east of Philadelphia's City Hall.</p>
        <p>For about a week, there was discussion of projecting the Loews name at night in silhouette behind the existing letters. But that idea was scrapped. ''I said, 'No, it's not worth tampering with an icon on the Philadelphia skyline,' '' Mr. Tisch recalled.</p>
        <p>His judgment was vindicated at the news conference with Mayor Edward G. Rendell in 1997 when the project was announced. With hundreds of jobs and tens of millions of dollars involved, the first question from the press corps was, What's happening to the sign? ''I was very proud to say, 'We're leaving it alone,' '' Mr. Tisch said.</p>
        <p>That philosophy carried over to the rest of the project, in which the bank's most memorable public interiors were restored, beginning with an entrance hall off Market Street, almost 50 feet high, where a monumental flight of stairs and pair of escalators rise up to what was the main banking room. The walls are vast expanses of Belgian black and Bardiglio gray marble, unornamented by anything but a thin, four-foot metal ring that serves as a clock. The temptation for almost any hotelier would have been to lighten and brighten this austere space. But Mr. Tisch told the designers, ''Anybody who touches this hallway is off the job.''</p>
        <p>''All you can do by tinkering is something that isn't appropriate,'' he said. ''Philadelphians truly have a sense of ownership of PSFS. It was incumbent upon us to recognize that bond.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the chief architect of the restoration and renovation, Arthur W. Jones of Bower Lewis Thrower, can trace his family's connection to the site even farther back than the bank tower. His father attended the William Penn Charter School, which the PSFS Building replaced.</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, founded in 1816, was America's first savings bank. There was nothing traditional, however, about the building it commissioned in 1929 from the architects George Howe and William Lescaze, whose own startlingly modernist town house at 211 East 48th Street is a New York City landmark.</p>
        <p>To contemporary eyes, the PSFS Building looks as if it had been built in the 1960's, with its strongly expressed grid of limestone columns and brick spandrels framing ribbons of glass and aluminum. The design was so innovative that in 1932, before construction was even finished, Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson included the tower in their enormously influential exhibition, ''The International Style: Architecture Since 1922,'' at the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
        <p>Turning their backs on Greek temples and Florentine palazzi, Mr. Howe and Mr. Lescaze created rooms of intersecting, asymmetrical planes polished to a highly reflective gleam. The stark lines and somber monotone of black, gray, silver and white were broken by surprising accents: red ceiling panels, blue tile floors and curving mezzanine walls made of a golden yellow French marble as savory as an omelet. In the 33rd-floor board room, the view toward the statue of William Penn atop City Hall was framed by one wall of Macassar ebony and another of book-matched walnut.</p>
        <p>''This building has such richness in its concept,'' Mr. Jones said. ''It's been like getting to know Beethoven.''</p>
        <p>All the tower's attributes could not save it from economic obsolescence, however. By 1992, it was 85 percent vacant. (And PSFS, after a troubled turn as the Meritor Savings Bank, had been acquired by the Mellon Bank Corporation from the F.D.I.C.)</p>
        <p>What changed its prospects was the opening in 1994 of the Pennsylvania Convention Center just across Market Street. That turned a marginal office location into a prime spot for a hotel. The conversion project was begun by the developer Ronald Rubin of the Rubin Organization, who first approached Hyatt Hotels and then Loews, which later bought out his interest.</p>
        <p>The PSFS Building did not have nearly enough of the meeting and mechanical space needed in a modern hotel, and there was no way to shoehorn it in. A rooftop cooling tower, for example, would have compromised the sign, which serves as a screen for the existing equipment.</p>
        <p>FORTUNATELY, there was a large parcel adjoining the PSFS tower, which the Rubin Organization and Loews bought from the F.D.I.C. for the purpose of building a four-story hotel annex, with ballrooms, mechanical equipment, truck bays and offices. ''Having that piece of land made this whole thing work,'' said Robert M. Powers of Powers &amp; Company, an architectural preservation firm involved in the project.</p>
        <p>As it happened, the quality that made the tower floors less desirable for office tenants -- a narrow, 60-foot span -- yielded an almost ideal hotel layout, with rooms along either side of a central corridor.</p>
        <p>In the guest rooms, as in the new restaurant and lobby, the interiors firm of Daroff Design borrowed from the more exuberant and ornamental Art Deco vocabulary.</p>
        <p>''Our first instinct was to stay with the minimal design of the International style but we did need to soften it,'' said Karen Daroff, president of Daroff Design. ''We took almost a cinematic approach, using Hollywood's view of the 20's and 30's, juxtaposed with the abstract geometry.''</p>
        <p>The hotel opened in April, housed the Florida delegation during the Republican convention and is now running at about 65 percent occupancy, which is as expected six months into operation, Mr. Tisch said.</p>
        <p>Three blocks from the Loews Philadelphia, the Girard Trust Company banking hall and tower by McKim, Mead &amp; White, are now a 330-room Ritz-Carlton. In New York, another landmark in which McKim, Mead &amp; White had a hand, the former Merchants' Exchange and National City Bank at 55 Wall Street, has reopened as the 144-room Regent Wall Street.</p>
        <p>In Chicago, the Reliance Building, a crystalline tower by D. H. Burnham &amp; Company, is now the 122-room Hotel Burnham, operated by the Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group. Kimpton plans to convert the former Tariff Commission headquarters in downtown Washington, an antebellum marble temple, into the 172-room Hotel Monaco.</p>
        <p>Tom LaTour, the president of Kimpton, said the conversion of derelict landmarks makes economic sense. ''If the building is empty or in disrepair or underutilized,'' he said, ''implicit is that it can be acquired at below-market or advantageous costs, which allows you to do a few extras that you wouldn't otherwise do in a new enterprise. We think more and more that people who travel want to have a unique experience.''</p>
