        <p>Death Valley was Creation's trial run. The ideas were good. The raw materials were in place, though not necessarily in what we've come to regard as the ''right'' place.</p>
        <p>Let there be iron oxides and copper and magnesium and mica to form alluvial fans and washes and canyons and mud hills. Let there be two great lights; the greater to scorch by day and the lesser to rule the night and inspire Ansel Adams.</p>
        <p>Let there be winged fowl that may fly above the earth: road runners, ravens, hummingbirds. And creeping things and beasts of the earth: tarantulas, lizards, rattlesnakes and tortoises; bobcats, ringtails and mountain lions; foxes to feed on kangaroo rats, bighorn sheep to feed upon the herb-yielding seed.</p>
        <p>Visiting geologists studying this 3.3-million-acre national park, some 120 miles northwest of Las Vegas and 285 miles northeast of Los Angeles, speak in billions. ''Well, one billion years ago'' -- this rock did that to that rock. To them it was just yesterday.</p>
        <p>When you're here, it begins to feel that way. You're back at the beginning. Voluptuous alluvial fans, dips and rises of gravel dumped by flash floods over the last few million years resemble so many attempts to get form just right. You can practically hear Creation's thoughtful ''Hmmmmm.'' It's that silent here.</p>
        <p>Alex Cabana, the front desk manager at the Furnace Creek Inn, a 66-room resort opened in 1927 by the Pacific Coast Borax Company, claims, ''It's the sound of your own heartbeat.''</p>
        <p>I check into this mission-style, adobe brick inn for a few days, to use it as a base as I hike into the desert to try to make sense out of a landscape that eludes casual categorization.</p>
        <p>People have come to the desert for centuries for just this reason, to shed habits of thinking. To let their thoughts unfold to the very end. Mystics, prophets and seers, 60's acid droppers, New Millennium fast-lane dropouts. The extreme conditions (temperatures that plummet 40 degrees between a 113-degree morning to a chilly night) and the untouched-by-man vastness -- 95 percent of the park is wilderness -- of white sand dunes 50 feet high, golden cliffs, purple hills all serve to put us in our place.</p>
        <p>At this moment, all I have in mind is relief for travel-weary joints. The pool, says Alex. The pool's water, fed by an underground spring, is a constant 85 degrees. ''No chemicals. No chlorine.''</p>
        <p>There are 600 known springs in Death Valley, and the original settlers found them by following animal tracks. The spring feeding the Furnace Creek Inn's pool is so mineral rich that I float and bob on the surface.</p>
        <p>But not for long. The sun is unyielding. I head for the shade of my cool, spare, whitewashed room, lie down on the bed and expect to evaporate.</p>
        <p>I try to close my eyes against the view, a vast sweep of desert and distant, snowcapped Panamint mountains. A nap is imperative because in two hours the Inn's manager, Toni Jepson, and I are going to the opera. No long skirt required. No pashmina. No jewels. Actually, not much of an audience, because some of it's painted on the walls.</p>
        <p>In 1967, 43-year-old Marta Becket, a dancer on a trip home to Manhattan from Hollywood, was waylaid by a flat tire in Death Valley Junction. It was then, she claims, while exploring the ghost town -- once owned by the Pacific Coast Borax Company -- where she sought shade, that she saw her dreams take shape.</p>
        <p>Deserts do that. Chimeras. Mirages. Thoughts that begin to form patterns rather than bouncing back at you. Tricks of light that make the veil between form and illusion thin to the point of disappearing. So why not? Why not claim the borax company's music hall, built in 1907 and deserted 40 years later, when the borax mining boom came to an end.</p>
        <p>Over the next few years, Marta restored and repaired structures, and then, just in case nobody ever came, she painted an audience on the walls. What does it matter that it's a 16th-century Spanish audience, complete with monks, nuns, ladies of the night and nobility? In Death Valley, time stretches with the horizon.</p>
        <p>And so does credibility. After all, this is the place where a Chicago millionaire, Albert Johnson, built a Spanish-style mansion in 1915, and did not protest when his friend Walter Scott claimed to the world that it was his. A charismatic pretender, Scotty persuaded investors that he owned several lucrative gold mines in Death Valley. The mines were a fantasy, the mansion a fantasy given form, complete with towers, turrets and 14 fireplaces, forever to be known as ''Scotty's Castle.''</p>
        <p>So, no one thought much about a dancer performing for a painted audience. But tonight is looking busier than those early days, in the living, breathing sense of busy, including a group of teenagers on a school trip from the Fresno Valley. Tonight, 76-year-old Marta will perform her original work ''The Doll Maker,'' in one act, three scenes, ''with incidental music by Johann Strauss.''</p>
        <p>Toni and I drop our $10 admission charge into a gold-painted coffee can held by Marta's boyfriend of 17 years, Tom Willett. A man in his 70's, he sports 60's-style hair and clothes and affects a certain 60's defiant insouciance. I ask if tonight looks like a full house. ''Yup, 120, that's a full house.'' We take our seats (1940's movie theater seats) next to a group I recognize from the Inn. Chances are that the others are campers, unless the curious have driven from the nearest civilization, the town of Pahrump, some 60 miles away.</p>
        <p>The lights, bare bulbs shielded by five-pound coffee cans, dim. The pink curtain, painted by Marta, parts and there she stands. Dressed as a doll and on point. Irony is washed out in the desert. There's not enough energy for the extras. This is not a play on itself. This is the play. And the performer takes it seriously as she delivers her aria in a high, frail voice punctuated by the braying burros she keeps in a corral out back.</p>
        <p>An hour later, at the show's conclusion, I go to the front desk where one can rent a room for the night. ''Honey, did ya like the show?'' the clerk wants to know. I assure her that I did and ask if I might see a room. ''Sweetheart, just walk along out there and somebody'll let you into their room.''</p>
        <p>Sure enough. A man and a woman standing on the threshold of an open door, invite me to have a look. ''If you can believe it,'' says the husband of the pair.</p>
        <p>The double bed's mattress folds in the middle like a wing. The bathroom tiles are few and far between. But Marta has painted a pre-Raphaelite scene of exuberant romance above the missing headboard. ''She's a good painter,'' I offer. Wife: ''It's a nice room. Very comfortable. I've seen worse.'' Husband: ''Well, I haven't.'' Wife: ''Better than our tent.'' Husband: ''Well, then you sleep here. I'm goin' to the tent.''</p>
        <p>I ease my way through the growing tension and into the wide expanse of night air. Christmas tree lights in red, yellow and green illuminate the few mesquite bushes around the property. Sirius and Procyon overhead outshine them. And though there is no moon tonight, the stretches of white sand reflect all available light, as though the source is within them. The landscape undulates like a sea.</p>
        <p>If you find yourself in Death Valley and prefer to sleep without burros for neighbors, you have a choice of three National Park Service concessions. Furnace Creek Inn is the most luxurious. Family-oriented Furnace Creek Ranch is more casual (so casual that coyote pups fetch your ball should you care for a game of golf on the world's lowest course, 214 feet below sea level). And Stovepipe Wells, which is rudimentary to the point of high camp.</p>
        <p>I dine at Stovepipe Wells the following evening and am swept back to the 50's and the first road trip my family took cross-country. It was a 50's family thing: load the kids and a drooling dog into a Studebaker sedan and go see ''this great land of ours.'' Those same families seem to have been frozen in time because here we all are, on Naugahyde seats in a large paneled dining room, dining at 5:30 on Jell-O-and-marshmallow salad.</p>
        <p>My pre-moonlight horseback ride feast. The National Park Service and Furnace Creek Ranch run a horse program led by Robin and Mark Berry, who have the horses saddled and standing in perfect formation as five of us gather in the corral.</p>
        <p>''Butt in the saddle, back straight, head high,'' Robin advises. She has the no-nonsense self-confidence of one who has grown up with horses and knows what makes them tick.</p>
        <p>''And don't let them stop to eat mesquite,'' Mark adds. ''If you do, you'll be out there all night.''</p>
        <p>Mark cuts such a striking figure, a horse whisperer with a black eye patch, that I wonder if he's in disguise to make the unsuspecting Easterner swoon. His assistant, James, is also one of those Cowboys-Are-My-Weakness kinds of cowboy. He wears a lavender bandanna around his neck. It matches his eyes. A long, brown ponytail hangs out the back of his Stetson.</p>
        <p>He helps me mount my horse and holds my knee while adjusting the stirrups. Oh, my. ''How's that?'' he asks, easing my foot into the stirrup. I want to say, ''Hmm, not quite right.'' Liar.</p>
        <p>We head out after James, who, mounted, makes a large, Westward-Ho gesture. We pull bandannas over our noses as the horses kick up the dust. You can see this from miles away. It looks like a whirlwind when, from a distance, you spot the spirals of heat and sand kicked up by a herd of wild horses or riders such as ourselves.</p>
        <p>We ride beneath a navy blue sky as darkness moves across the land and begins to blur the outlines of mesquite and sage. Then Mars pops out like a celestial jack-in-the-box. Then Jupiter and Saturn. The Big Dipper dips down, and soon the Funeral Mountain peaks take on a glow like the nimbus in Northern Renaissance paintings. Then, pop! There it is! The goose has laid the golden egg. Upside down. In slow motion.</p>
        <p>''Wow! The moon!'' the kid behind me shrieks. ''Yowks!'' I hear myself echo. We're the first people on earth seeing the first moon for the first time.</p>
        <p>A kinship with those ancients is strongly felt in a landscape that looks much as it did when they inhabited it. ''You know, there are petroglyphs here that show a man on a horse,'' whispers Dave Woodruff, my waiter at breakfast the next morning.</p>
        <p>Dave moved here to experience the timelessness. It's a passion that makes people come and stay. A passion for silence, for vistas that change with every slight slant of light. Because you are afloat in a sandy wash of time, you feel weightless. You can travel a billion years in a minute. As though to accentuate that point, the moonlight ride featured falling stars. Stars too tired to stay up after billions of years. Stars that had died long before we saw them fall.</p>
        <p>Dave also whispers that if I'm willing to walk for six hours, I'll come to a rock where the forty-niners engraved their names before moving on or giving up the ghost. Top secret. ''You'll recognize the names.'' Just about everybody here lives with the ghosts of these forty-niners who came through looking for a shortcut to the California gold fields. It feels like yesterday to today's inhabitants. They're well versed in William Lewis Manley's 250-mile trek over mountain and desert in search of the stranded members of the Bennet party. They speak of Julia, a baby who died soon after birth to a mother who had suffered dehydration and starvation as the group frantically circled the desert, seeking a way out. They speak of these people as though I could pick up the phone and request an interview if I had any further questions.</p>
        <p>Dave draws me a map on his order pad. ''You go exactly 8.1 miles down this road that's closed. You got four-wheel drive and high clearance?'' I tell him I had rented a Volvo C70, not realizing I was going to be needing a Humvee. ''That's fine. They test-drove that car here. You know, above sea level, below sea level, over boulders. You'll be fine. Go slow. Take plenty of water. At 8.1 miles get out and walk this way.''</p>
        <p>His map becomes topographical. Plateaus, valleys, canyons. If I follow his lines, I'll come to the petroglyphs.</p>
        <p>I pack a backpack with a compass and a whistle (sound travels for miles, so there's always the chance that if I get lost out there, someone 20 miles away, the distance I'm traveling from the nearest ear, might hear me). Half a gallon of water, the amount recommended if you're heading into the desert, a wide-brimmed hat against the sun and hiking boots against any surprises.</p>
        <p>I spend the day in fruitless search. And yet, I'm discovering that out here, the plans you make have little to do with the vistas you'll see.</p>
        <p>There is no predicting in Death Valley. You think that there's nothing but sand before you, then you gain slight elevation and you're gazing out over a mesquite-green valley leading to snowcapped mountains. This is the view that stops me in my tracks, makes me lower my pack to the ground and myself to a flat rock. I begin to understand why the Old Testament Prophets headed to the desert. It's a place of visions. The now-you-see-it, now-you-don't of miracle.</p>
        <p>When I return to the Inn, a message from Mark Berry invites me to sign on as a volunteer with the Park Service, and accompany him into a desolate canyon to pick up Nathan Niemi, a geologist who's been camping there while mapping uncharted territory. We'll drive the horses an hour into the desert, then ride them for three hours each way.</p>
        <p>We meet at 6 a.m. and head off with two pack mules and an extra horse for Nathan. It's spring and the poppy-yellow globemallow pushes through any available space between rocks. Vibrant pink blossoms adorn spiny beaver-tail cactus. Finches sing sweetly in the sagebrush and blue-gray gnatcatchers weave a demitasse-shaped nest between branches of an indigo bush.</p>
        <p>After half an hour of climbing, we look behind and observe that the truck and trailer have taken on the diminutive, toylike quality of objects seen from an airplane. The canyon pulls us forward like an updraft.</p>
        <p>Mark lets me take the lead. ''See if you can find the way.'' I begin to feel cocky until he warns, ''Don't get so close to that lip'' of the three-foot-wide ledge I'm crossing. I look over the side. Oh, yes. Three hundred feet straight down in either direction. I straighten my back into a posture that I hope bespeaks great courage. I do want to be invited back.</p>
        <p>After an hour in the lead, I spot the waving gesture of a man clearly eager to see us. A week alone with rocks and snakes and black widows and a moon so bright that he couldn't sleep fuel his enthusiasm. Mark is still out of sight; Nathan sees me alone and looks puzzled.</p>
        <p>''I saw your flares,'' I announce, ''and I have come to rescue you.''</p>
        <p>Take a woman out of Manhattan. Put her in the desert with no company but a horse and a cowboy, and she's bound to put on airs.</p>
