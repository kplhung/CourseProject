        <p>Tarzan of Central Park</p>
        <p>Q.: A friend recently told me about a young man who used to build elaborate hidden treehouses in Central Park. What has become of the treehouses, and the man?</p>
        <p>A.: The treehouses are long gone, but the man who built them, Bob Redman, can still be found amid the leaves and boughs of New York City.  He began building tree houses in Central Park as a teenager in 1978. Over the next eight years he built 13 between 79th and 86th Streets, each more spectacular than the last.</p>

        <p>Tarzan of Central Park</p>
        <p>Q.: A friend recently told me about a young man who used to build elaborate hidden treehouses in Central Park. What has become of the treehouses, and the man?</p>
        <p>A.: The treehouses are long gone, but the man who built them, Bob Redman, can still be found amid the leaves and boughs of New York City.  He began building tree houses in Central Park as a teenager in 1978. Over the next eight years he built 13 between 79th and 86th Streets, each more spectacular than the last.</p>
        <p>Occasional sightings of Mr. Redman as he scrambled from branch to branch, and the sounds created by bongo-playing visitors, fueled legends of drum-beating tree dwellers.  Hearing those rumors, Parks Department officials began hunting for the treehouses and dismantling them. But each time they took one down, Mr. Redman built another.</p>
        <p>His final treehouse, which he named Spacecraft Epsilon Eridani, was built high in a towering beech across from a Parks Department  equipment yard in 1986 and escaped detection for four months. That treehouse was put together using over 1,000 pounds of scrounged scrap lumber, which Mr. Redman took bit by bit into the park at night. It had five rooms with ladders, rope bridges, tables and benches and was camouflaged with branches and green paint. When Parks Department officers caught up with Mr. Redman, they admired the quality of his work and his evident appreciation of nature, noting that his dwellings were built without injuring any trees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Redman worked for the Central Park Conservancy from 1986 to 1989, then started a company, Bob Redman Urban Forest and Backyard Tree Care, in 1990. Although last year he built a 2,500-pound treehouse in North Salem, N.Y., Mr. Redman spends most of his time pruning branches in Manhattan. ''I enjoy being up in the trees,'' he said. ''I like the solitude and the view. There's something mystical about it.''</p>
        <p>Liberty's Blackouts</p>
        <p>Q.: While riding my bicycle through Battery Park on a clear night, I was admiring the lights shining from the Statue of Liberty's torch. Have those lights ever been extinguished?</p>
        <p>A.: Although in recent years the torch has been illuminated each night, the symbolic flames of liberty have not always shone so consistently. The statue was dedicated on Oct. 28, 1886, and electric lights in the torch were turned on four days later. Originally, the statue was intended to serve as both monument and lighthouse. The glow from the torch lights was dim, however, and they were shut off after a week, said Barry Moreno, the librarian of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, and the author of a forthcoming book, ''The Encyclopedia of the Statue of Liberty.''</p>
        <p>After public protests over the extinguishing, the lights were made brighter and turned back on. They were next turned off in 1916 to allow for the repair of stress damage incurred when saboteurs blew up a munitions warehouse in Northern New Jersey. During World War II, the torch was blacked out, but was permitted to blaze briefly in celebration of the Normandy invasion and V-E Day. The most recent dark period was 1984 to 1986, while the statue's arm was being repaired.</p>
        <p>Sixth Floor (Puff, Puff)</p>
        <p>Q.: I live in a five-floor walk-up and my friend lives in a walk-up with six. Is there a height limit for walk-ups?</p>
        <p>A.: Although there are seven-story walk-ups in the city, and there may even be a few taller ones, regulations limited them to six stories in 1968. But the walk-up era is essentially over, said a Buildings Department spokesman, Paul Wein. In 1987, Local Law 58 forbade the construction of residential buildings of more than two stories without elevators.</p>
