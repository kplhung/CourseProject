        <p>Hampton tailback Montrell Coley rushed for 2 touchdowns and 91 yards as Hampton held on to defeat Howard, 26-24, today at the 30th New York Urban League Classic at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>''Whenever these two schools get together, it's going to be a tough and entertaining ballgame,'' Hampton Coach Joe Taylor said. ''The fans definitely got their money's worth today.''</p>
        <p>''This was a very important victory for us,'' Coley said. ''I was glad I could contribute when the game was on the line.'' The senior, named the game's offensive most valuable player, rushed for 27 yards on the decisive scoring drive in the second half.</p>
        <p>The Bison had a chance to regain possession after cutting Hampton's deficit to 2 late in the game, but Hampton quarterback Ataveus Cash hooked up with split end Zuriel Smith for 10 yards on a crucial third down, sealing the victory for the Pirates.</p>
        <p>The Bison trailed by 13-3 at the half, and early in the second half it looked as if they would fall even deeper into a hole. Hampton was driving in Howard territory when the backup tailback Travis Hailes fumbled on the Howard 35. The Bison recovered and embarked on a four-play drive that led to a 6-yard touchdown pass from the backup quarterback Bobby Townsend to Kevin Simmonds to pull Howard to 13-10. Townsend had entered the game early in the second half, after a knee injury sidelined the starter Donald Clark.</p>
        <p>Hampton answered with a 69-yard scoring drive to take a 20-10 lead. Cash connected with wideout Michael Compton on a 33-yard touchdown pass to finish the drive at with 3 minutes 37 seconds left in the third.</p>
        <p>Howard again trimmed the lead to 3 with a 27-yard scoring pass from Townsend to fullback Tauric Rice with 2:22 left in the quarter. The Bison had a chance to tie it early in the fourth, but kicker Charles Card missed from 38 yards.</p>
        <p>That's when Coley and the Hampton offensive line took over. Hampton steamrolled Howard on the ensuing possession, going 79 yards in 11 plays while taking more than five minutes off the clock. Coley dived in from 2 yards to give Hampton a 26-17 advantage with 5:31 remaining.</p>
        <p>Townsend scored on a quarterback sneak that was set up by a 73-yard pass play to Rice to make it 26-24, but the Bison did not gain possession again.</p>
        <p>''I thought our boys showed some character holding on to the ball and running out the clock,'' Taylor said.</p>
