        <p>ANGELS have been gracing pop culture fairly ostentatiously these last several years -- ''Touched by an Angel,'' ''City of Angels,'' ''Angels in the Outfield,'' ''Angels in America,'' John Travolta spectacularly spreading his wings in ''Michael,'' the elevation of ''It's a Wonderful Life'' to a basic text of American civilization. But lately, and almost unnoticed in the seraphic swell, the Devil has been getting his due.</p>
        <p>Date the current surge to 1997, when Al Pacino was so charismatically diabolical in ''The Devil's Advocate.'' Since then, the Devil has been a featured player in three television series, ''G vs. E,'' ''Brimstone'' and ''God, the Devil and Bob''; had a big part last year in the Arnold Schwarzenegger  action picture''End of Days''; prominently appeared in the Johnny Depp vehicle ''The Ninth Gate''; was the prime mover of the plot of the Kim Basinger movie ''Bless the  Child'' this summer; and had the key supporting part -- the best part, really, and one in which he showed a surprising comic touch and a long-hidden singing voice -- in ''South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut,'' last summer's animation hit.</p>
        <p>I know what you're thinking: with as many people in Hollywood headed for hell as the religious right seems to think, why such an uneven output? All three television series tanked. The big ''Ninth Gate'' reunion of Roman Polanski and the Devil turned out to be less a reimagining of ''Rosemary's Baby'' than leftovers on the order of ''The Odd Couple II.'' And ''End of Days,'' dramatically speaking, fell short of apocalyptic. But the Devil must have an awfully good agent: this fall will have no fewer than five movies featuring Old Nick.</p>
        <p>''Bedazzled,'' a remake of the Peter Cook-Dudley Moore classic, stars Brendan Fraser as a nerdy young man who, in exchange for the fulfillment of seven wishes, surrenders his soul to a very seductive Devil played by Elizabeth Hurley. ''Little Nicky'' is a comedy in which the casting seems half the attraction: Adam Sandler as Satan's good son, Harvey Keitel as Satan and Rodney Dangerfield as Satan's father. In ''Lost Souls,'' a thriller, Winona Ryder plays a devout schoolteacher who becomes aware of a Satanic conspiracy against a New York journalist (like, only one?). ''Simon Magus,'' a British film by Ben Hopkins set in 19th-century Europe, is about a young man seemingly possessed by the Devil (Ian Holm, who, making sure that all his bases are covered in the afterlife, played a Satan-fighting priest in ''Bless the Child''). And the granddaddy of them all, ''The Exorcist,'' will be rereleased with additional material never shown before -- perhaps scenes where the poor girl stops spewing pea soup and moves on to beef barley and chicken with stars. Not to give anything short shrift, hovering somewhere in straight-to-videoland is ''G-Men From Hell,'' in which the Devil is portrayed by Robert Goulet.</p>
        <p>While this does seem to be an especially verdant crop full of stellar performers, Devil movies have always been with us. A search of the Internet Movie Database (imdb.com), in a highly unofficial but still usefully suggestive count, yields 290 movies about the Devil, starting with Georges Melies's ''Cabinet de Mephistopheles,'' which was made in 1897, but more than half the films have been made since 1980. Among the more provocative items on the list: ''Inflation'' (1942), in which the Devil, in response to a telephone call from Hitler, begins wrecking the American economy by encouraging people to cash in their war bonds, to hoard and to spend too much money (no doubt an impressionable Alan Greenspan attended repeated showings); ''Santa Claus'' (1959), in which Santa has to battle Satan's minions before delivering his Christmas Eve rewards; ''Satan's Cheerleaders'' (1977), in which the members of a high school cheerleading squad turn out to be -- as many have long suspected -- ringleaders of a satanic cult; ''Fertilize the Blaspheming Bombshell'' (1990), in which a comely lass is menaced by Satan worshipers en route from New York to Las Vegas, and ''Girlfriend from Hell'' (1990), in which the Devil, fleeing one of God's agents, hides in the body of a young woman on a blind date. Perhaps this is based on a true story.</p>
        <p>Although we missed these films, we've seen plenty of others. Some general themes emerge.</p>
        <p>1. HOLLYWOOD CAN'T AGREE ON WHAT THE DEVIL CAN DO.  Moviemakers are pretty consistent about the Devil's being the source of all evil in the world, but there's a range of opinion on other matters, beginning with whether he's the Devil at all. Sometimes the character we see is clearly Satan (Mr. Pacino in ''The Devil's Advocate,'' the Beast in ''Rosemary's Baby''), sometimes he is the Devil in human form (Gabriel Byrne in ''End of Days''), and sometimes he's the Devil's son (Sam Neill in the ''Omen'' sequels). Sometimes, for whatever reason, the Devil is more reclusive, and we meet his emissary or servant (Rufus Sewell in ''Bless the Child''). Sometimes it's not clear whom we're seeing. Emmanuelle Seigner may be the Devil in ''The Ninth Gate,'' but the whole movie is about how complicated it is to summon the Devil, and she's been hanging around the whole picture. In ''Damn Yankees,'' is Ray Walston the Devil or just his field representative in Washington? And why isn't his office on K Street?</p>
        <p>Other questions remain. Sometimes the Devil can be thwarted by faith -- in ''The Evil'' (1978), when the psychologist played by Richard Crenna uses a crucifix to stab Victor Buono, playing Satan as a grouchy neighbor who won't give back your baseball, it stymies Satan long enough for Mr. Crenna to escape. Rediscovering faith helps Mr. Schwarzenegger thwart the Devil in ''End of Days.'' But they're stars. Faith is fairly useless to secondary characters, like the elderly priest in ''The Omen'' whose function in the movie is to warn a skeptical Gregory Peck that he really shouldn't be worrying about getting his son into a good prep school, and then to die gruesomely. Sometimes faith has nothing to do with it: in ''Crossroads'' (1983), the hero's classical-music training enables him to win a blues-guitar showdown and beat the Devil.</p>
        <p>There are other discrepancies. Usually the Devil has extraordinary demonic powers. But at other times he seems weaker, resorting to agents -- a dog in ''The Omen,'' street kids in ''Bless the Child'' -- to wreak havoc. Occasionally he goes to great lengths to avoid suspicion: in ''The Omen,'' he kills a character by causing him to be decapitated by a runaway cart -- nothing a veteran police officer hasn't seen before; in ''Bless the Child,'' the Devil proves as inept as a Bond villain -- instead of just offing Kim Basinger, he tries to kill her by causing her to drive off a bridge, and she gets away. All this is very confusing. Is the Devil who causes a lighting bolt to break a shaft off a church and then sends it ripping through the air to pierce a cleric in ''The Omen'' the same Devil who relies on sweaty spells, deal-making and the drug-dispensing ministrations of Ruth Gordon just to get a young woman pregnant in ''Rosemary's Baby''? Can the Devil who blows up restaurants on a whim in ''End of Days'' be the same fussy businessman who patiently waits for Mickey Rourke to track down Johnny Favorite in ''Angel Heart''? Why does Mr. Pacino's Devil let his minions spend so much time shredding documents to thwart a government investigation if he's perfectly capable, as he demonstrates, of just killing the investigator?</p>
        <p>Well, maybe he is -- the big source book is hardly consistent. Professor Elaine Pagels, the Harrington Speare Professor of Religion at Princeton University, points out in her book ''The Origin of Satan'' that the first few times Satan appears in the Old Testament, he's just a servant of God sent to obstruct human activity -- on God's orders. Gradually, Satan's role evolves. He prods God to test Job; later, Satan is blamed for pushing King David into an unpopular tax plan. Only in Isaiah do we finally get the 411 about the rebellion of the angels who sought to elevate themselves above God. And in the New Testament, Jesus arrives to redeem the world from Satan, who aims to stop him. In the first gospels, Satan tempts Jesus personally; in the last gospel, Jesus is tempted by people. If the Bible isn't consistent about what the Devil does, how can we expect Hollywood to be?</p>
        <p>2. THE DEVIL IS CURIOUSLY ENCUMBERED BY RULES, BOUNDARIES, BUREAUCRACY.  In ''The Evil,'' he is stuck in the basement of an old, spooky house and would never get out without the help of some well-meaning social workers (secular humanists!) who move in. In ''The Ninth Gate,'' Satan can be summoned only with secret incantations recited in the right order -- placing the film at odds with all the movies in which he roams around at will. In ''End of Days,'' Satan has to assume human form, and impregnate a certain woman by a certain date to establish his realm; he may be the Prince of Darkness, but punctuality counts. In ''Crossroads,'' a blues singer signs his soul away on paper. In ''Damn Yankees,'' the contract has an escape clause. In ''Angel Heart,'' all the Devil wants is the soul he was promised. Maybe one day we'll get an Arthur Miller version, Satan Loman, his feet aching, wearily pushing his temptations on an inattentive world.</p>
        <p>3. IT DOESN'T PAY TO WORK FOR THE DEVIL.  Although the Devil seems to have cast a kindly glance at the old folks who served him in ''Rosemary's Baby,'' elsewhere he is literally the Boss From Hell. In ''Omen III,'' ''Angel Heart'' and ''The Devil's Advocate,'' useful, loyal retainers are crisply eliminated the moment they cause Satan any trouble. In ''Damn Yankees,'' when his assistant, Lola, gets too sweet on her intended victim, the Devil makes her ugly. When you go to work for the Devil, think in terms of immediate payoffs; his pension plan is weak.</p>
        <p>4. THE DEVIL IS ALWAYS PUTTING CHILDREN FIRST.  A surprisingly large number of movies have to do with Satan's wanting to be a father. Obviously, there's ''Rosemary's Baby.'' But ''The Omen'' is about the Devil's son, ''End of Days'' about the Devil wanting to sire a son, and ''The Devil's Advocate'' about Satan wanting his son to sire a son. You can't really say that ''The Witches of Eastwick'' is about the Devil's wanting to sire a son, but in the end he winds up with three. ''Little Nicky,'' clearly, is going to fall somewhere in this tradition. Also clearly, these plot lines are a reaction to the story of Jesus, the Son of God. But the impulse isn't the same: Jesus comes to redeem humanity by his death, a sacrifice no son of Satan is being asked to make. Why does Satan need an heir? Is he going somewhere? Does he have expansion plans? Who's going to mentor the kid? And if he spends his apprenticeship drinking, taking drugs and chasing women, doesn't that constitute learning the business?</p>
        <p>5. EVERYBODY LIKES TO PLAY VILLAINS.  Jesus has been played by Max von Sydow, Jeffrey Hunter and Willem Dafoe. But look who has played the Devil: Mr. Pacino, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, George C. Scott, Billy Crystal, Claude Rains, Donald Pleasence, Sam Neill, Vincent Price, Terence Stamp and Mickey Rooney. That's a lot of awardware on hell's mantelpiece.</p>
        <p>6. IT'S HARD TO BE TEMPTING.  Devils in the movies generally come in two forms: destroyers and tempters. The destroyers are fairly easy to place -- you just have to be bad. It's harder to be the tempter -- for the scene to work, Satan really has to be persuasive. You can see how hard it is in last year's mini-series ''Jesus,'' in which Jeroen Krabbe, a capable actor, had to persuade Jesus to renounce his mission. Mr. Krabbe was about as convincing as a car dealer; far better at the art of closing are Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Pacino. In ''Eastwick,'' Mr. Nicholson's Devil plays on each woman's vulnerability, teasing out her small resentments and places of self-pity to bring her along. In ''The Devil's Advocate,'' Mr. Pacino goes one better: he actively encourages the Keanu Reeves character to do the right thing, knowing that he has so cleverly stacked the deck that Mr. Reeves will reject the virtuous alternative. In the end, he still overplays his hand, and Mr. Reeves thwarts him by killing himself -- which seems to be the method of choice for thwarting the Devil (see  Mr. Schwarzenegger in ''End of Days'' and Jason Miller in ''The Exorcist'').</p>
        <p>But surely these are only temporary setbacks. That's the thing about the Devil -- he's always practicing.</p>
