        <p>A Fly for the Prosecution</p>
        <p>How Insect Evidence Helps Solve Crimes.</p>
        <p>By M. Lee Goff.</p>

        <p>True-crime potboilers have always involved their fair share of science: the analysis of fibers from the blood-stained car, the DNA typing from a scrape of skin under the dead girl's fingernail, the pathologist's reconstruction of bullet trajectories from the body wounds. It seems only a short, logical step in the genre's evolution to popular writing on the science of true crime. And so, ready for the lazy Sunday afternoon, we have ''A Fly for the Prosecution,'' an irresistible coupling of murder stories and a high-minded science tale -- about bugs on corpses no less.</p>
        <p>When I was 10, I was walking along a road in my rural Ohio hometown when I came across a lovely orange tabby curled up, seemingly uninjured, in the grass. I nudged the cat with my foot. Over it flipped. And then I saw. The head was hollowed out and swarming with maggots. I ran and ran and ran the mile back home. It is a mark of how seductive M. Lee Goff's book is that today I would stop and take a moment to see what the little critters were up to.</p>
        <p>Goff is a forensic entomologist, and he tells the story of what exactly that means and of how his field (which hardly existed before 1980) came to take a respected place in death investigations. Along the way, he provides a small hive of entomological tales. Perhaps my favorite is a case from 1985. A woman had been found murdered in Texas, and among the many items collected at the scene was a mangled grasshopper found in her clothing. The insect went ignored until a suspect, upon being frisked, was found to have the left hind leg of a grasshopper in the cuff of his pants leg. Court testimony demonstrated that this was the only portion of the grasshopper not recovered from the body and that the fracture lines matched perfectly. Although the defense argued that ''grasshoppers always break their legs like that,'' the evidence was decisive. The suspect was convicted of murder. This was hardly the usual case, even for forensic entomologists, but it reveals the essence of what they do. In one way or another, they use the insects at the scene as witnesses to the crime.</p>
        <p>Goff, a professor of entomology at the University of Hawaii, is consulted on cases from all over the country. If it's local, he hops on his motorcycle, tucks an insect net under the seat and rides out to collect the bugs from the body himself. Often, however, they are simply delivered (FedEx apparently will do). Back in the laboratory, the painstaking part begins: figuring out what the insects reveal. And what they do varies. It turns out that many species have rather tightly circumscribed habitats. In one case, when Goff found a maggot known as Synthesiomyia nudiseta on the decomposing body of a woman in an Oahu sugar cane field, he proved she had to have been killed in the city. This species is found only on bodies in urban dwellings. Insects can also show whether someone had taken drugs before death, even after the remains have decomposed. Maggots, entomologists have learned, absorb drugs from the bodies they consume and can be analyzed just the same as human tissue.</p>
        <p>Mainly, however, investigators turn to insect experts to estimate when someone died. The fact that entomologists succeed at this black art is remarkable. With insects, they appear to have overcome over 150 years of intense, often weird, but largely unsuccessful science devoted to discovering time of death. (Goff unfortunately leaves this earlier history unchronicled, curiously underselling his field's accomplishment.) Their success stems from a simple observation made surprisingly recently: there is a precise and orderly progression of insect activity involved in the decomposition of a corpse.</p>
        <p>The key concept is succession: when one group of insects arrives and feeds, it simultaneously prepares the way for another. Goff, a marvelously vivid and clear explainer of his science, likens a corpse to a barren volcanic island emerging from the ocean, waiting to be colonized by plants and animals. Blowflies and flesh flies are the first on the scene, zeroing in on a dead body from even miles away in a matter of minutes after death. They deposit eggs that hatch maggots, which begin consuming the tissue within hours. As the corpse progresses through its stages of decomposition (there are apparently five: fresh, bloated, decay, postdecay and skeletal), some insects arrive to prey on the maggots (ants and wasps, for example), some (like the hide beetles) come when the skin is dried out or cartilage exposed and so on. Depending on what bugs are on the body, and what stage of development they are in, entomologists can determine when a person died to within a day.</p>
        <p>The actual nuts and bolts are, of course, even more complicated than this sounds. The bug experts have to take into account ambient temperature, amount of clothing, extent of injury and myriad other factors to arrive at an accurate time estimate. Goff uses plenty of true-life (or rather true-death) cases to show how it's done. The tales can be riveting. And you find out about all sorts of goofy stuff along the way. (For example, the animal of choice for decomposition studies -- the one with a body that most approximates ours -- is a big fat pig; after a couple of days the maggot feeding gets so frenzied the carcass temperature can rise to over 125 degrees Fahrenheit.) There are even feats of derring-do. To solve a case in which a woman's body was found wrapped in layers of blankets, Goff wrapped a 50-pound pig cadaver the same way and monitored it hour by hour in his backyard to determine how long it took the insects to gain access to the corpse. (It was 2.5 days.)</p>
        <p>Yet the book sometimes bogs down. For one thing, as is often true in science writing, the ideas tend to make more compelling reading than the lab work. Around the third or fourth case, you find yourself skipping past the description of species found and the calculating of the death date. For another, the story of how this new science came to be is supposed to propel the narrative, but it fails to draw you along. Goff does give us glimpses of the excitement and uncertainties and messy squabbles. But, perhaps inevitably, he tells these tales of humans less vividly, with less character and purpose, than the tales of bugs. It's clearly the bugs that brung him.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Goff is onto something with his science-of-true-crime chronicle. Already a book called ''The Maggot Was the Witness'' is heading for the shelves next spring. Next can we expect ''The Fiber on the Corpse,''+ ''The Saliva Told the Tale,'' ''The Killer Left a Molecule''? One can only hope so.</p>
