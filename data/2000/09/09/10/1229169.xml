        <p>The Mark Hopkins Inter-Continental Hotel in San Francisco is scheduled to complete a yearlong renovation by the end of this month. Although the 19-story hotel, a Nob Hill fixture for more than 75 years, has remained open during the project, up to 75 percent of its rooms were closed at a time.</p>
        <p>Improvements include expanded bathrooms, a renovated lobby, new decor and the installation of high-speed Internet access and high-tech lighting and temperature controls in each room. To accommodate 10 new suites, the number of rooms has dropped from 389 to 380. Other than a cleaning, the renovations did not involve the hotel's landmark facade, which was restored about 18 years ago. Also untouched was its well-known Top of the Mark lounge.</p>

        <p>Built in French chateau and Spanish Renaissance styles, the hotel opened in 1926 on the site of the former mansion of Mark Hopkins, one of four magnates who founded what eventually became the Southern Pacific Railroad.</p>
        <p>The Mark Hopkins Inter-Continental is at 1 Nob Hill, (800) 662-4455; on the Web at www.markhopkins.net. Doubles run $320 to $410, with suites $510 to $3,000.</p>
