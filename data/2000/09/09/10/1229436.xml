        <p>When the Democratic Party looked for Congressional seats it could pick up in the November elections, the one held by Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota was high on the list.</p>
        <p>Senator Grams, a conservative Republican in a state with a large liberal bent, has made few legislative splashes in his one term in the Senate, and his approval rating has been notably low.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grams also hit several personal speed bumps that took the steam out of his family-values message. He was divorced, then apparently became involved in a relationship with a senior aide that led to the resignation or dismissal of several other staff members. And last year, sheriff's deputies found marijuana in a truck that Mr. Grams's 21-year-old son was driving.</p>
        <p>Democrats had been all but counting that Mr. Grams, who won the 1994 election with 49 percent of the vote, would make it easy for them to recapture the Senate seat. But these days things look less certain.</p>
        <p>The Democrats have been unable to unify around any of their four major candidates: an heir to a department store fortune; a trial lawyer who led the state's lawsuit against the tobacco industry; a state senator who owns a bar in northern Minnesota; and a businesswoman who ran a Minneapolis housing agency.</p>
        <p>And, faced with a primary on Tuesday, unusually late in the political season, the candidates have been forced to spend campaign resources battling one another instead of Senator Grams.</p>
        <p>''Grams is ripe for the taking, but so far nobody has really jumped out as somebody who has a really good chance of taking him,'' said Chris Gilbert, a political science professor at Gustavus Aldophus College in St. Peter, Minn. ''Even if somebody emerges with a comfortable victory in the primary, there just isn't much time left.''</p>
        <p>Three of the four major candidates for Senate are millionaires, and the primary for Minnesota's Democratic Farmer Labor Party, as the Democratic Party is known here, has emerged as the most expensive in state history.</p>
        <p>Mark Dayton, a former state auditor, is heir to the Dayton Hudson department store fortune and has spent $4.6 million, most of it his own money. Mike Ciresi, a trial lawyer who orchestrated the state's $6.6 billion settlement from tobacco companies, has spent about $3.4 million, financing more than half of it himself. And Rebecca Yanisch, a construction company executive who also led the Minneapolis Community Development Agency in the 1990's, a housing agency, has spent about $1.5 million, a third of it from her own pocket and some of the rest from Emily's List, which raises money for Democratic women who support abortion rights.</p>
        <p>The only candidate who has raised so little money he could afford only one last-minute television advertisement is the candidate who has the party's official endorsement, State Senator Jerry Janezich, who owns Tom and Jerry's Lounge in Minnesota's Iron Range. He has spent about $300,000.</p>
        <p>''We are the endorsed candidate and the only one who's been in legislative office before,'' said a spokesman for Mr. Janezich, Troy Matson. ''We're going to try and get the message out that he is the only candidate who is like average Minnesotans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Janezich's difficulty in raising money is partly due to his humble style, political experts say. But it is also a sign of the weakness of the Democratic Farmer Labor Party. Its endorsement has helped Mr. Janezich get labor support, but has otherwise made little difference in fund-raising or the polls. Perhaps the most publicity Mr. Janezich has received came when Jay Leno made him the subject of a crude joke after he crawled under a table to thank union supporters.</p>
        <p>''For many years, Minnesota prided itself on having a strong party system, on raising to the highest levels people who came up through the party with distinguished careers in public service,'' said Steven Schier, chairman of the political science department at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn. ''This is money buys ads, produces votes. That's what's going on in the nation and it's coming to Minnesota.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dayton, who is well-known here, in part from previous unsuccessful bids for governor and senator, has pulled ahead in recent polls. But those polls, taken before last-minute campaign blitzes by all four candidates, also indicate that a quarter of voters are undecided.</p>
        <p>''I'm assuming nothing,'' said Mr. Dayton, whose campaign has included setting up a ''help line'' to assist people in resolving problems with their health maintenance organizations, and taking busloads of older people to Canada so they can buy cheaper prescriptions.</p>
        <p>All four candidates, who agree more often than not, talk about helping the elderly and farmers, and making health care more affordable. Mr. Dayton favors immediate universal health insurance, while Mr. Ciresi and Ms. Yanisch want to proceed more slowly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ciresi, second in the polls, favors normalized trade relations with China. Mr. Janezich, third in recent polls, has a record of supporting labor, the environment and other liberal causes. Ms. Yanisch, who talks about her early life as a struggling single mother and her brother's suicide stemming from depression over farm crop failures, has positioned herself as the most moderate.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there are any big issues in Minnesota,'' Professor Schier said. ''Minnesota is a hotbed of rest.''</p>
        <p>Whoever wins the primary will have no trouble distinguishing himself or herself from Mr. Grams, whose causes include a conservative plan to privatize Social Security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grams, whose biggest legislative accomplishment has been the $500-per-child tax credit, is still not in great political shape. He has spent all but $1 million of the $5.6 million he has raised, and a recent poll had his favorable rating dropping 9 points since June, to 38 percent.</p>
        <p>As for charisma, Professor Schier said: ''Our politics are dominated by two showboats,'' Senator Paul Wellstone, a Democrat, and Gov. Jesse Ventura, an independent. ''This guy isn't even a canoe.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Senator Grams, Kurt Zellers, said the senator was aware that political commentators had predicted his vulnerability, but ''he says it's awfully hard to feel vulnerable when you're out there campaigning and people come up and say, 'Thanks, Rod.' ''</p>
        <p>And these days, no one in Minnesota thinks a Grams defeat is a foregone conclusion.</p>
        <p>''I think whoever the Democrat is, is still going to have a very tough time beating Rod Grams,'' said Blois Olson, a former Democratic consultant who now edits a Web site on Minnesota politics. ''Rod Grams, whatever he's done or said, has run and positioned himself among senior and rural voters as this American champion for tax cuts, health care benefits and apple pie. And I think people are beginning to think that he's being picked on or targeted.''</p>
