        <p>Winifred Elizabeth Alexandra Ohrstrom and Daniel Arthur Nichols were married yesterday in The Plains, Va. The Rev. Caroline Parkinson, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony at Grace Church of The Plains. The Rev. Lawrence Burns, a Roman Catholic priest and cousin of the bridegroom, took part in the service.</p>
        <p>The bride, 31, is known as Wea. She teaches watercolors at the John Page Turner Community House in The Plains, and is also studying for a bachelor's degree at Georgetown University</p>
        <p>She is the daughter of Sandra Shepard Wright of New York and George Lewis Ohrstrom Jr. of The Plains. The bride's mother is a founder of Friends of the Institute of Noetic Sciences of New York, which promotes applications of the human-consciousness work of the institute. The bride's father is the president of G. L. Ohrstrom &amp; Company, investment bankers in New York. He is also the founder of the National Sporting Library, a collection of books on horsemanship and sporting subjects in Middleburg, Va.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 42, is a vice president for business development and strategic marketing at ColumbusNewport, a lobbying and venture banking firm in Arlington, Va. He worked in the State Department during the administration of George Bush as a deputy assistant secretary of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, overseeing training of foreign law-enforcement officers and emergency evacuation plans for United States embassies and consulates. He graduated from Canisius College in Buffalo and received a master's degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom is a son of Lorraine Landel Nichols and the late Dr. David H. Nichols, a surgeon who taught at Harvard and Brown, and who developed a gynecological subspecialty for older women.</p>
        <p>The couple met in 1997 at a steeplechase in Warrenton, Va., in which a jockey friend of Mr. Nichols was riding a horse owned by Miss Ohrstrom's family.</p>
