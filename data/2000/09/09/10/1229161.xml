        <p>''DEAD END''  ''A medium for social betterment that is tremendous and forceful.'' So raved the noted theater critic Mayor Fiorello La Guardia of New York City in 1935, after seeing the Broadway production of Sidney Kingsley's cautionary tale about the lure of a life of crime, set among teenagers in Depression-era Lower Manhattan. The film starred Humphrey Bogart as the not-to-be-emulated thug. Here he is played by Dominic Fumusa, best known, perhaps, as a pal of the Sopranos.

        <p>''WHERE DID VINCENT VAN GOGH?''  Let's hope the lines are cleverer than the title.

Ugly adventures ensue, then redemption. Previews begin Thursday. Opens Sept. 24. Steppenwolf Theater Company, Chicago.</p>
        <p>''TANTALUS''  This is, as the Greeks might warn, hubris.

Terrence McNally wrote the book, toughening up those sweetheart characters for an American audience; a newcomer, David Yazbek, wrote the score, which has some sock. Jack O'Brien directs. Previews begin Sept. 26. Opens Oct. 26. Eugene O'Neill Theater. (Tele-Charge)</p>
        <p>''TEXTS FOR NOTHING''  The marvelously serious clown Bill Irwin, directing and performing in a one-man show that is adapted from the prose works of Samuel Beckett.

        <p>''DOLL''  Theater Couture, which specializes in campy and far-fetched send-ups of popular culture (its last production, ''Tell-Tale'' in 1997, took on Edgar Allan Poe and B-movies), steps a little out of character here with its version of the Ibsen classic ''A Doll's House.'' Starring Sherry Vine (a k a Keith Levy), one assumes, as Nora. Previews begin Sept. 29. Opens. Oct. 5. P.S. 122, 150 First Ave., at 9th Street. (477-5288) www.ps122.org</p>

        <p>''THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE''  A new musical in a pre-Broadway run (well, the producers have their fingers crossed) based on the 1967 film about women in the jazz age. Starring Erin Dilly as Millie (tabloid headline writers: n.b.), Tonya Pinkins and Pat Carroll. Directed by Michael Mayer. With music from the movie and additional songs by Jeanine Tesori.

        <p>''OEDIPUS REX''  Grecophiles, alert! A production of Sophocles' tragedy by the 100-year-old National Theater of Greece, in modern Greek (with English supertitles). Directed by Vassilis Papavasiliou, with Grigoris Valtinos in the title role. This summer the production was presented in the Colosseum in Rome, the first show seen by an audience there in 1,500 years -- no kidding, not since lions were dispatching gladiators and ostensibly vice versa. Performances are Oct. 4-8 at City Center, not so historical but a nice place. (City Tix)</p>
        <p>''GAME SHOW''  Be forewarned: Set during the broadcast of a game show, this play by Jeffrey Finn and Bob Walton uses audience members as contestants. Previews begin Oct. 10. Opens Oct. 25. 45 Bleecker Street. (Ticketmaster)</p>
        <p>''BIG POTATO''  A Third Reich officer is discovered hiding in a Queens beauty parlor; this comedy by Arthur Laurents, produced by the Jewish Repertory Theater, sounds a bit like ''Judgment at Nuremberg'' meets ''All in the Family.'' Previews begin Oct. 14. Opens Oct. 22. The Duke on 42nd Street. (831-2001)</p>
        <p>* ''THE UNEXPECTED MAN''  This one should create ample buzz, particularly for an Off Broadway show. To begin with, Alan Bates is making his first New York stage appearance since he won a Tony Award in Simon Gray's ''Butley'' almost 30 years ago. Opposite him, no slouch herself, is Eileen Atkins. The two play, respectively, a writer and literary fan who meet on a train.

Previews begin Oct. 10. Opens Oct. 24. Promenade Theater. (Tele-Charge)</p>
        <p>* ''PROOF''  The Broadway premiere of last season's Off Broadway hit about mathematics, love and the nature of genius.

        <p>''THE TALE OF THE ALLERGIST'S WIFE''</p>
        <p>Two Broadway transfers in the same week is quite a coup for the Manhattan Theater Club, which last season presented ''Proof'' and this comedy by Charles Busch about a witty and whiny woman (Linda Lavin) who lives on the West Side and is afraid life is passing her by. Enter her childhood friend. Oy! Also starring Tony Roberts and Michele Lee. Directed by Lynne Meadow. Previews begin Oct. 11. Opens Nov. 2. Ethel Barrymore Theater. (Tele-Charge)</p>
        <p>''NOCTURNE''  The debut of a highly touted young playwright, Adam Rapp; his play is about a teenager who accidentally kills his sister, and the tragedy's lingering effect on the family. Previews begin Oct. 12. Opens Oct. 15. American Repertory Theater, Cambridge, Mass. (617-547-8300) www.amrep.org</p>
        <p>''LES MIZRAHI''  A new series of cabaret performances presented by the Off Broadway company the Drama Dept. is inaugurated by the fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, who sings, dances and sews, accompanied by the Ben Waltzer Trio. Mr. Mizrahi, not surprisingly, designed the sets and costumes. Previews begin Oct. 13. Opens Oct. 19. Greenwich House Theater. (Tele-Charge) www.dramadept.com</p>
        <p>''MATTERS OF THE HEART''  An evening with Patti LuPone, accompanied by piano and string quartet. Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center. Selected Sundays and Mondays beginning Oct. 15. (Tele-Charge)</p>
        <p>''SEUSSICAL''  Even if you do not like green eggs and ham, you might be curious. David Shiner as the Cat in the Hat -- they have the same neck, after all -- seems reason enough to look forward to this musical adaptation of the work of the famously lyrical children's author a k a Theodor Seuss Geisel. Kevin Chamberlin portrays Horton the Elephant. Directed by Frank Galati, with a score by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, all of whom collaborated on ''Ragtime.'' Choreographed by Kathleen Marshall. Previews begin Oct. 15. Opens Nov. 9. Richard Rodgers Theater. (Ticketmaster) A related article is on Page 4.</p>
        <p>''FORBIDDEN BROADWAY 2001: A SPOOF ODYSSEY''  A new edition of the long-running (18 years!) satire. Opens Oct. 20. Stardust Theater (inside Ellen's Stardust Diner), 1651 Broadway at 51st Street. (Tele-Charge)</p>
        <p>''MAQUINA HAMLET''  Known in English as ''Hamlet Machine,'' this 1997 play was written by the German playwright and director Heiner Muller, who imagined Hamlet witnessing the crumbling of the Berlin Wall. The production, however, is by a Buenos Aires troupe, El Periferico de Objetos, and features photo projections, disembodied voices and puppets -- and echoes of the politics of Argentina. Oct. 18-21. Next Wave Festival. Brooklyn Academy of Music. Harvey Theater.</p>

        <p>''THE ROCKY HORROR SHOW''  No dress code. A revival of the campy stage musical that became a cult film classic, it arrives with an intriguing cast -- Joan Jett and Dick Cavett, plus the Broadway veterans Lea DeLaria, Alice Ripley, Jarrod Emick, Daphne Rubin-Vega -- and, one would assume, a core audience of predisposed enthusiasts. Previews begin Oct. 20. Opens Nov. 15. Circle in the Square. (Tele-Charge)</p>
        <p>''BARRIO BABIES''  A musical satire by Luis Santeiro and Fernando Rivas about the stereotyping of Latinos in Hollywood. Previews begin Oct. 21. Opens Nov. 12. John Houseman Theater. (Tele-Charge)</p>

        <p>''FAME TAKES A HOLIDAY''  A play, with music, about comedians on the verge of fame.

        <p>''TOKYO NOTES''  The Seinen-dan Theater Company of Tokyo performs a play by Oriza Hirata about the values of contemporary Japan.

In Japanese, with English supertitles. Oct. 26-28. Japan Society. 333 E. 47th Street. (752-3015) www.jpnsoc.com</p>
        <p>''COBB''  With the aid of a surprising angel -- Kevin Spacey -- Lee Blessing's estimable stage biography of the legendary ballplayer and misanthrope Ty Cobb, produced last season by Melting Pot Theater, not only got a reprieve from an early closing, it is being reprised Off Broadway.

Previews begin Nov. 7. Opens Nov. 14. Magic Theater, San Francisco. (415-441-8822) www.magictheatre.org</p>
        <p>''JANE EYRE''  Who's that singing in the attic? A musical based on the Charlotte Bronte novel. The music and lyrics are by a pop composer new to the theater, Paul Gordon, but there are some substantial pedigrees involved as well.

With Marla Schaffel as Jane and James Barbour as Mr. Rochester. Previews begin Nov. 7. Opens Dec. 3. Brooks Atkinson Theater. (Ticketmaster)</p>

Previews begin Nov. 8. Opens Nov. 15. Long Wharf Theater, New Haven.</p>
        <p>''OLD MONEY''  Quite a year for Wendy Wasserstein -- first a new baby, now a new play.

But when did she have time to write it? Starring John Cullum. Directed by Mark Brokaw. Previews begin Nov. 9. Opens Dec. 7. Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater. Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>* ''ARSENIC AND OLD LACE''  Voices!, a new series of one-night-only staged readings of rarely revived plays -- in the manner of the Encores! musical series -- begins on Nov. 11 with Joseph Kesselring's macabre comedy from 1941 about two sweet and murderous old ladies.

Richard Thomas, as the emissary (in a role first played in 1964 by John Gielgud), teams up once again with the director Mark Lamos; the two joined forces in a Hartford Stage production of the play in 1998. Previews begin Nov. 16. Second Stage.</p>
        <p>* ''JESUS HOPPED THE A TRAIN''  A tough and lyrical prison drama by a young writer, Stephen Adly Guirgis. This production, by the tiny Labyrinth Theater Company, had an overflow word-of-mouth crowd for 10 days of workshop performances this summer, and it now has independent backing for a commercial run.

Nov. 28-Dec. 3. Next Wave Festival. Brooklyn Academy of Music. Howard Gilman Opera House.</p>
        <p>''BETRAYAL''  What sounds like a sexy revival of Harold Pinter's backwards-in-time-moving drama about the disintegration of a marriage. Starring Liev Schreiber, Juliette Binoche and John Slattery. Directed by David Leveaux. Opening date to be announced. Roundabout Theater Company. American Airlines Theater. (719-1300) www.  roundabouttheatre.org</p>
        <p>''THE PLAY ABOUT THE BABY''  Edward Albee's most recent work concerns two couples, an older and a younger, and an infant who may or may not exist. Sound familiar? If a production later this season of ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,'' directed by Robert Falls, makes its way from the Goodman Theater in Chicago to Broadway (as is the hope), New York stages will have a provocative set of Albee bookends. ''Baby'' will land off Broadway, in a theater to be announced, and its opening date could fall anywhere between November and February. David Esbjornson will direct, and when they finish with their first play together this fall (see ''The Butterfly Collection''), Marian Seldes and Brian Murray will star.</p>
        <p>December</p>
        <p>''THE WAX''  A wedding at a seaside hotel, with writers and scientists as the randy guests. This new bedroom farce by Kathleen Tolan is directed by David Petrarca, who, in the deliciously nutty ''Fuddy Meers'' last year, showed he has a deft touch with whimsy. Previews begin Dec. 12. Opens Jan. 7. Playwrights Horizons.</p>
        <p>''FORCE CONTINUUM''  The Atlantic Theater Company commissioned this play by Kia Corthron about a three-generation family of black cops in which the youngest member is both accused of and victimized by police brutality. Previews begin Dec. 13. Opens Jan 4, 2001.</p>
        <p>January</p>
        <p>''HUMAN EVENTS''  A barbed observer of Yankee pretense, A. R. Gurney puts a skewer to the academy in this play set in the stodgy humanities department of a small New England college. Directed by David Saint. Opens Jan. 6. George Street Playhouse, New Brunswick, N.J.</p>
        <p>''TIME AND AGAIN''  The second full production (the first was at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego in 1996) of a musical based on Jack Finney's atmospheric fantasy novel from 1970 -- part mystery, part romance and very New York -- about a time-traveling advertising illustrator. Book by Jack Viertel, music and lyrics by Walter Edgar Kennon. Directed by Susan Schulman (''The Red Shoes''). With Laura Benanti (''Swing!'') and Julia Murney (''The Wild Party,'' Off Broadway version). Previews begin Jan. 9. Opens Jan. 30. Manhattan Theater Club Stage II.</p>
        <p>''OEDIPUS THE KING''  A new adaptation set in contemporary urban Africa by Adrienne Kennedy. Directed by Jonathan Wilson. Previews begin Jan. 11. Hartford Stage.</p>
        <p>''DIDO, QUEEN OF CARTHAGE''  The idiosyncratic Target Margin Theater, as is its wont, unearths a rarely performed work. This Elizabethan drama, by Christopher Marlowe, is based on the Greek myth of Dido and Aeneas and set on the Mediterranean in northern Africa. Directed by David Herskovits. Previews begin Jan. 17. Opens Jan. 24. Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street. (358-3657)</p>
        <p>''CELLINI''  An appealing match: a stage biography of the egomaniacal Florentine sculptor by John Patrick Shanley (''Danny and the Deep Blue Sea,'' the film ''Moonstruck''), who generally has a good time with florid passions. Previews begin Jan 23. Second Stage.</p>
        <p>''THE RHYTHM CLUB''  Good luck, boys. The composer, Matthew Sklar, is 26; the book writer and lyricist, Chad Beguelin, is 30, remarkably young to have created a Broadway musical. Particularly striking is the fact that it is not a contemporary story, and not based on a contemporary musical idiom. Set in Germany in the 1930's, it tells the tale of two swing musicians, one gentile, one Jewish, and the female singer they hire to front their band. Sex, religion, the Holocaust -- that's enough conflict for any musical. Directed by Eric Schaeffer (''Putting It Together''), the artistic director of the Signature Theater in Arlington, Va., where it is being staged now. Its pre-Broadway run at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts in Chicago begins Dec. 9. Previews begin Jan. 26 at a Broadway theater to be announced. Opens Feb. 15.</p>
        <p>* ''BOY GETS GIRL''  Sex and the city, not-so-glamorous division, from Rebecca Gilman, the author of the recent ''Spinning Into Butter.'' After an unpromising blind date, a young woman is stalked by the hopeful young man, whose unwillingness to take no for an answer grows increasingly threatening. Previews begin Jan. 30. Opens Feb. 20. Manhattan Theater Club.</p>
        <p>''JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG''</p>
        <p>Abby Mann's stage adaptation of his own screenplay and teleplay about the Nuremberg war trials. Directed by John Tillinger. The first production this season by Tony Randall's National Actors Theater. Date to be announced.</p>
        <p>February</p>
        <p>''DAVID COPPERFIELD''  Granted, the title character is a bit of a drip, but the poisonously creepy Uriah Heep and the gentle incompetent Mr. Micawber should provide great fodder for the stage. Plus, every eighth-grade teacher in America will bring the class. Adapted and directed by Giles Havergal. Previews begin Feb. 1. Opens Feb. 11. Steppenwolf Theater Company, Chicago.</p>
        <p>''RASHOMON''  The Pan Asian Repertory Theater revives the 1959 drama by Fay and Michael Kanin (based on the sterling film of 1951 by Akira Kurosawa), about a violent encounter in the woods involving a samurai, his wife and a bandit -- and their conflicting perspectives on the events. Performances begin Feb. 8. The West End Theater at the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, 263 West 86th Street. 212-505-5655.</p>
        <p>* ''LOBBY HERO''  Kenneth Lonergan is staking a claim as the playwright laureate of New York City. After two recent successes -- ''This Is Our Youth,'' set on the Upper West Side, and ''The Waverly Gallery,'' in Greenwich Village -- he now adds a third contemporary urban drama, about two policemen and a security guard and his supervisor who encounter one another in an apartment house lobby after a murder. Previews begin Feb. 16. Opens March 13. Playwrights Horizons.</p>
        <p>''WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?''</p>
        <p>Like Arthur Miller, Edward Albee is seeing his past work resurface with a vengeance even as he continues to produce new plays. This revival of his 1962 masterpiece, set on a college campus, about a bitterly hostile professor and his wife and their unsuspecting young pair of dinner guests, is uncast as yet, but the director is David Esbjornson, who directed Mr. Miller's ''Ride Down Mount Morgan'' on Broadway and is scheduled to direct Mr. Albee's ''Play About the Baby'' off Broadway this season as well. This is likely to be the third major regional production of ''Virginia Woolf'' this season, following one at Trinity Rep in Providence in the fall and one at the Goodman Theater in Chicago in January. (The Goodman production, to be directed by Robert Falls and possibly starring Patti LuPone, was teetering on the brink of confirmation at press time.) Previews begin Feb. 24. Opens March 2. Guthrie Theater, Minneapolis. (877-447-8243). www.guthrietheater.org</p>
        <p>''I WILL BEAR WITNESS''  The premiere of an adaptation of the diaries of Victor Klemperer, a German Jew, kept during 12 years of the Third Reich. This is a solo performance by George Bartenieff, who, with Karen Malpede, adapted the stunningly detailed diaries, which were published for the first time in English just a year ago. Previews begin Feb. 25. Opens March 11. Classic Stage Company.</p>
        <p>''BIG LOVE''  The playwright Charles Mee takes a fable by Aeschylus about 50 sisters promised in marriage against their will to 50 brothers, and turns it into a virulent battle of the sexes. In its premiere production in the spring, at the Humana Festival of New American Plays in Louisville, it was so physical for the actors that it was staged on an enormous wrestling mat. Previews begin Feb. 28. Opens March 7. Long Wharf Theater.</p>
        <p>''DOGEATERS''  Jessica Hagedorn adapts her own novel of reminiscence about life under Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines in the 1980's. Directed by Michael Greif (''Rent''). Joseph Papp Public Theater. Opening date to be announced.</p>
        <p>March</p>
        <p>''COYOTE BUILDS NORTH AMERICA''</p>
        <p>Tales of sex and heroism from Native American myths, based on stories by the writer Barry Lopez, adapted and set to music by John Luther Adams. Part of the 50th-anniversary season of the Arena Stage in Washington. Previews begin March 2. (202-488-3300)</p>
        <p>* ''FOLLIES''  This goes in the high expectations department: the first Broadway revival of the Stephen Sondheim-James Goldman musical since it opened in 1971. The show, which tells the story of a reunion of dancers in the crumbling theater where they once performed, has one of Mr. Sondheim's most pungent and best-loved scores; the show won seven Tony Awards -- and flopped financially. A very of-the-moment creative pair, Matthew Warchus (''True West'') and Kathleen Marshall (''Kiss Me, Kate''), will, respectively, direct and choreograph, filling legendary shoes (Harold Prince's and Michael Bennett's) from the legendary original. Presented by the Roundabout Theater Company. Previews begin March 6. Opens April 5. Belasco Theater. (719-1300) www.roundabouttheatre.org</p>
        <p>''TEN UNKNOWNS''  Jon Robin Baitz (''The Substance of Fire'') is drawn to collisions between artistic high-mindedness and real-world morality. His new play is about an octogenarian painter living in Mexico as a recluse and several unexpected visitors. Directed by Daniel Sullivan. Previews begin March 8. Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater. Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>''TUVA OR BUST!''  Alan Alda portrays the iconoclastic physicist Richard Feynman in a new play by Peter Parnell, directed by Gordon Davidson. Previews begin March 11. Opens March 22. Mark Taper Forum, Los Angeles. (213-628-2772)</p>
        <p>* ''THE PRODUCERS''  Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick are on the wish list to star as the lovably, ineptly corrupt theater producers Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom, in this stage adaptation of Mel Brooks's film (with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder) about a show that is supposed to flop -- and doesn't. Mr. Brooks wrote the book as well as the score, which of course includes the title song of the doomed-to-succeed musical-within-the-musical, ''Springtime for Hitler.'' Susan Stroman choreographs and directs. Previews expected to begin in late March. St. James Theater (Tele-Charge)</p>
        <p>''THE AMEN CORNER''  A revival of James Baldwin's 1954 play, set in Harlem, about jazz, faith and family. Directed by Chuck Smith. Previews begin March 16. Opens March 26. Goodman Theater, Chicago.</p>
        <p>''THE INVENTION OF LOVE''  The New York premiere of Tom Stoppard's play about the poet A. E. Housman in confrontation, at the end of his life, with his youthful self. Presented on Broadway by Lincoln Center Theater. Directed by Jack O'Brien (''The Full Monty,'' Mr. Stoppard's ''Hapgood''). Cast, theater and opening date to be announced.</p>
        <p>''TOP DOG/UNDERDOG''  A black family with brothers named Lincoln and Booth; such is the barbed comic perspective of the playwright Suzan-Lori Parks (''In the Blood''), teaming up here with a director, Charles S. Dutton, who is not likely to shy away from wicked wit. Joseph Papp Public Theater. Date to be announced.</p>
        <p>''BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS''  A Broadway revival of the first volume of Neil Simon's autobiographical trilogy, set in Brooklyn in 1937. A search is on for the next Matthew Broderick, who played the 15-year-old Eugene (read: Neil) in the original 1983 production. Directed by Jerry Zaks (''Laughter on the 23rd Floor''). Date and theater to be announced.</p>
        <p>* ''STONES IN HIS POCKETS''  This two-handed comedy by a Belfast playwright, Marie Jones, has been a crowd-pleasing hit in London, largely because the unheralded actors -- Conleth Hill and Sean Campion -- are so marvelously facile in portraying more than a dozen characters: the Irish extras hired for a Hollywood movie, and the presumptuous Americans who invade their home turf. Theater and date to be announced.</p>
        <p>April</p>
        <p>''TROILUS AND CRESSIDA''  It seems Sir Peter Hall can't get enough of the Trojan War. After mounting John Barton's 10-play ''Tantalus'' in the fall, he takes on Shakespeare's tragedy, directing off Broadway for the first time in a long career in a production by the Theater for a New Audience. Previews begin April 1. Opens April 3. American Place Theater. (Tele-Charge) www.tfana.org</p>
        <p>''CRIMES OF THE HEART''  Cross-cultural dysfunction! The stage adventures of Beth Henley's nutty Mississippi sisters won the author the Pulitzer Prize in 1981. They are being directed this time by the Irish director Garry Hynes, whose handling of Martin McDonagh's play ''The Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' with its viciously curdled Irish stage family, won her a Tony Award in 1999. Performances begin April 3. Second Stage.</p>
        <p>''KIMBERLY AKIMBO''  David Lindsay-Abaire, whose pleasantly cockeyed comedy ''Fuddy Meers'' was one of last season's great surprises, returns with a tale about another loopy family -- they live in Teaneck, N.J. -- some of whose members are oddly afflicted, semi-drunk and/or criminally inclined. Kimberly is the 16-year-old daughter, poor kid. Previews begin April 6. Opens April 13. South Coast Repertory Theater, Costa Mesa, Calif. (714-708-5555) www.scr.org</p>
        <p>''CLAUDIA LAZLO''  The indefatigable Arthur Laurents, who knows something about what goes on backstage, checks in with a backstage drama about a domineering, passionate diva. Or is that redundant? Starring Cigdem Onat, the Turkish actress so well received last season as the pension owner in Lincoln Center Theater's revival of Mr. Laurents's ''Time of the Cuckoo.'' Opens April 21. George Street Playhouse, New Brunswick, N.J.</p>
        <p>''TOM SAWYER''  A new musical based on the Mark Twain classic, with music by Don Schlitz (a country songwriter best known for the Kenny Rogers hit ''The Gambler'') and a book by Ken Ludwig (''Crazy for You,''  ''Lend Me a Tenor''). Directed by Scott Ellis. Who knows? Broadway opening on April 26. Theater to be announced.</p>
        <p>''THE SEAGULL''  Chekhov's play, adapted by Regina Taylor (''Oo-Bla-Dee''), set in the Gullah Islands, off the coast of South Carolina. Previews begin April 27. Opens May 7. Goodman Theater, Chicago.</p>
        <p>''A THOUSAND CLOWNS''  Does anyone else but that lovable old eccentric Tom Selleck come to mind to play the lovable old eccentric Murray Burns? Well, maybe. Nonetheless, Mr. Selleck has signed on to make his Broadway debut in a revival of Herb Gardner's 1962 comedy about a nonconformist who drops out of the workaday world to raise his nephew. Theater and opening date to be announced.</p>
        <p>* ''KING HEDLEY II''  The latest installment of August Wilson's lyrical, decade-by-decade probing of the 20th-century black American experience takes place in Pittsburgh in 1985, among the urban poor. Directed by Marion McClinton, whose superb Off Broadway production of Mr. Wilson's ''Jitney'' transfers to the Union Square Theater on Sept. 19. ''King Hedley II'' has been in development in productions in Boston and Seattle, and will make stops in Chicago and Los Angeles before arriving in New York. Theater and opening date to be announced.</p>
        <p>''BELLS ARE RINGING''  ''Just in Time'' -- for the Tony deadline. Faith Prince stars as the answering-service operator who falls in love with a client -- a playwright, of course -- in the first Broadway revival of the 1956 musical by Jule Styne, Adolph Green and Betty Comden. Tina Landau (''Floyd Collins'') makes her Broadway debut as director. Jeff Calhoun (''Annie Get your Gun'') choreographs. Opens late April. Theater to be announced.</p>
        <p>''TALLULAH''  And once again, ladies and gentlemen, Miss Bankhead. A one-woman play by Sandra Ryan Heyward starring Kathleen Turner as the flamboyant actress on a night in 1947 as she plays hostess at a party for President Harry S. Truman. A multi-city pre-Broadway tour ends in Columbus, Ohio, on March 11. Broadway theater and date to be announced.</p>
        <p>''HOMEBODY/KABUL''  Information is scarce about this new play by Tony Kushner (''Angels in America''), but New York Theater Workshop claims it will present it beginning in late April or early May.</p>
        <p>May</p>
        <p>''SORROWS AND REJOICINGS''  Two women -- one white, one black -- in love with the same man. The South African playwright Athol Fugard revisits his homeland again in the wake of apartheid; he also directs. Opens May 1. McCarter Theater, Princeton, N.J. (888-278-7932) www.mccarter.org</p>
        <p>''WONDER OF THE WORLD''  Yet another cache of idiosyncrasies from David Lindsay-Abaire (''Fuddy Meers,''  ''Kimberly Akimbo''), the play is set in Niagara Falls and involves a young woman, an alcoholic bent on suicide, a sea captain and a large jar of peanut butter. Manhattan Theater Club. Previews begin May 1. Opens May 22.</p>
        <p>''CHAUCER IN ROME''  A new play by John Guare (''House of Blue Leaves,''  ''Six Degrees of Separation'') about Americans in Rome at the end of the millennium. Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater. Lincoln Center. Previews begin May 10. Opens June 7.</p>

        <p>June</p>
        <p>''IN THE PENAL COLONY''  Maybe wonderful, definitely weird. A music-theater piece by Philip Glass based on the Kafka story and directed by JoAnne Akalaitis. With earlier stops at A Contemporary Theater in Seattle and the Court Theater in Chicago. Previews begin June 7. Opens June 14. Classic Stage Company.</p>
