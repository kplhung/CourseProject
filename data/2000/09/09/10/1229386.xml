        <p>The time has come for that old baseball man, George W. Bush, to recall the words of another old baseball man, Leo Durocher: ''Nice guys finish last.''</p>
        <p>They don't win presidential elections, either. Mr. Bush's seeming unawareness of this adage has been fostering a growing sense of unease among his core supporters. When he killed a commercial prepared by the Republican National Committee last month because it was not fully accurate, he may have hoped that his high-road strategy would start to work again.</p>
        <p>It didn't. Today, Mr. Bush may be showing he is finally aware of the problem; the R.N.C. is airing a new spot that hammers the vice president for his fund-raising activities.</p>
        <p>Undoubtedly, Mr. Bush will be criticized for allowing the R.N.C. to run these ads and for breaking his pledge to run ''an optimistic, positive campaign in the Reagan tradition,'' as he promised to Nancy Reagan last spring.</p>
        <p>But there is nothing wrong with going on the attack, and he must start doing it himself on the campaign trail. Part of the myth of Ronald Reagan is that he was above the battle, that he lived 100 percent by his Eleventh Commandment -- ''Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican'' -- and that he applied it to Democrats as well.</p>
        <p>Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale can testify that this myth is not accurate. So could George W.'s father.</p>
        <p>In politics as in the movies, Mr. Reagan was always a white-hat guy, and he understood that it is also necessary that your opponent wear a black hat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush needs to take the same approach. He can treat Mr. Gore in good humor, with a smile or with a tone of regret. That's what Mr. Reagan did with Mr. Carter in their 1980 debate, when he said, ''There you go again.'' In fact, he was calling Mr. Carter a liar, but with a needle, not a bludgeon.</p>
        <p>While not a Ronald Reagan, Mr. Bush exudes warmth and friendliness. Therefore he can attack without raising his voice, without calling names, without snarling or sneering. But he is going to have to remind voters about  Mr. Gore, the political fund-raiser, the extreme environmentalist, the man who is not always truthful.</p>
        <p>After all, Mr. Gore has already attacked Mr. Bush on his record as Texas governor and on his ties to big oil. If Mr. Bush does not reciprocate, he is likely to find out that the best fate has to offer him is two more years as governor.</p>
