        <p>BOB WRIGHT, the president of NBC, is wrapping up a few last-minute details stateside this week before he heads off with  about 800 of NBC's biggest advertising clients for Sydney, Australia, and his network's biggest production of 2000, the Summer Olympics.</p>
        <p>With agreements to broadcast the Games in the United States for every Olympiad through 2008 -- a total of five -- NBC has become the network of the Olympics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wright said he would be spending a chunk of his time in Sydney Harbor, aboard the same ocean liner the network took to Barcelona in 1992 to wine and dine the biggest commercial spenders.</p>
        <p>He said he was increasingly confident that the 2000 Games, even at a fee of $705 million for American television rights, would prove to be an unqualified success, at least in programming if not quite in profits. Following are excepts from a phone conversation on Friday.</p>
        <p>BILL CARTER</p>
        <p>Q. How did the advertising industry respond for this Olympics, in light of the bribery scandals at the International Olympic Committee?</p>
        <p>A. That was certainly a concern to us but it does not seem to have affected any business issues. The I.O.C. handled it as best they could. They made a conscientious effort to clean things up and get the bad guys out. We hit our target in advertising sales of $900 million. This was a situation, when we went into those Olympic deals, where we hoped to enhance NBC's reputation and not lose too much money. We hit very good economic circumstances, which we were counting on. So this is not a money-losing situation for us this year. But it's not going to be much of a profit center.</p>
        <p>Q. Will this year's coverage differ much from previous Olympics?</p>
        <p>A. The biggest programming difference is 279 hours of Olympic programming on our cable networks, CNBC and MSNBC. There will be a total of 70 hours on the network. The cable exposure presents opportunities for other sports, especially for a lot of team sports that have never been seen, like soccer and softball. We're also going to have a full program of boxing on CNBC, starting every night at 5 p.m.</p>
        <p>Q. You were able to use the Olympic coverage on cable in negotiations to extend your agreements with cable operators for your cable channels. How significant are these new deals?</p>
        <p>A. We have been very interested in extending our carriage agreements with cable operators, and the Olympics were certainly an important part of that. We've used everything to gain the extensions, including retransmission consent agreements and some opportunities for improvements on the digital side when we reach that stage. Many cable operators were interested in extending through the end of our Olympic commitments in 2008 and some of them even went beyond that, to 2012. It means that CNBC and MSNBC are guaranteed carriage in the U.S. to a point as far off as 2012, That's enormously significant for us.</p>
        <p>And by the time we get to the Salt Lake City Games in 2002, the distribution for MSNBC will expand from 62 million homes to about 70 million, another very significant advance. The biggest television stations we own have always taken great advantage of Olympics years. Between the Olympics and the political advertising this year, it will be the biggest financial year ever for the stations we own.</p>
        <p>Q. You have committed almost $3 billion more for the rights to the Games in 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008. Given that, how crucial is it that you perform well in ratings from Sydney?</p>
        <p>A. Our performance in Sydney is very crucial. If some tragedy were to strike and we put up terrible numbers, it would certainly impact us negatively. But having said that, the reality is that Salt Lake City, as a domestic Olympics, stands on its own, has a cachet all its own. The impact of whatever happens in Sydney will be felt on Athens in 2004. But I'm confident we're going to do very well.</p>
        <p>Q. Much has been made of how big events, like ''Survivor'' on CBS, have helped bring viewers back to the networks. Does having the guarantee of an Olympics every two years provide NBC with a built-in advantage?</p>
        <p>A. It's important that we are able to say that we are the Olympic network, and we can keep on displaying those rings as part of our identity. Those rings have great recognition. That was a really important factor in helping us decide to take on this economic obligation. There is a debate about how valuable events like this are as promotional vehicles for future programming. It is hard to assess their promotional value, especially in the fall when the baseball playoffs will cause a lot of disruption of schedules. But the ability to have the most-watched programming to display your new shows is clearly a benefit. And we're already setting up for Salt Lake City. Those Games start only 13 months after we leave Sydney.</p>
