        <p>IS music a momentary thrill or is it a long-term companion? Popular music has always answered yes to both options.</p>

        <p>IS music a momentary thrill or is it a long-term companion? Popular music has always answered yes to both options.</p>
        <p>Hits are disposable by definition, since nothing is permanent on the pop charts. And the recording business isn't at all unhappy to face the pop equivalent of attention deficit disorder, on the theory that obsolescence means more opportunities to sell new tunes. The proliferating sources for music and other entertainment, from satellite television to the Internet, encourage potential listeners to surf for the next bit of stimulation, not to give a song a second chance. Napster, Scour and other free music-sharing programs on the Internet also take the commitment, in money and time, out of acquiring a piece of music; it's easy to download, play and delete a song without a second thought.</p>
        <p>Yet many musicians hope their work will stay with listeners. To spend long days and nights in studios, poring over every sonic nuance, they have to believe that at least some of their listeners will give the music enough consideration to let it sink in. They still expect that a certain core of fans will spend enough time with an album to hear all the details, to memorize songs, to take the music and the performers to heart.</p>
        <p>Lately, those two kinds of ambition have been increasingly polarized. Some musicians, contemplating youth demographics, are reaching for quick hit singles, proffering smiley teenypop tunes to the youngest fans and rude hip-hop and rap-metal to their older siblings, hoping to cash in before they outgrow current styles. The next season's platinum contenders include new albums by Limp Bizkit and Ricky Martin in October. Other musicians, however, cling to the idea that someone will still want to replay their albums in the distant future -- say, six months or a year after they're released.</p>
        <p>Outkast, a hip-hop duo from Atlanta, has designed itself with an ingenious balance between immediate gratification and lasting messages. One of its two rappers, Big Boi, is a light-hearted gangsta type, out for sex and excitement like many of the other street characters who zoomed up and down the pop charts in the 1990's. But Outkast's other rapper, Dre, thinks about issues like crime, drugs and illegitimacy. On its fourth album, ''Stankonia,'' which is due in October, Outkast embraces hip-hop as both a raunchy boast and a community alert, refusing to split mind from body. Yet their music makes it all sound like a party.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Outkast's duality is only a fraction of the multifariousness of the Wu-Tang Clan, whose many members make it more like a hip-hop coalition meeting than a standard group. With its members reconvened after many solo albums, the Wu-Tang Clan is slated to release its third album later this year.</p>
        <p>Madonna's long career has refuted all attempts to dismiss her as a short-lived pop infatuation, even as she used all the marketing machinery that makes pop hits explode. For nearly two decades she has caught musical styles on the upswing, even as she latched on to fashions that made her worth watching. But she and her collaborators also came up with songs that have outlasted the trends they exploited. ''Music'' is Madonna's second album in collaboration with the producer William Orbit, who merged dance-floor propulsion with sensuous electronic dreamscapes for ''Ray of Light,'' as she continues her transit from earthly desires to spiritual hopes and yearnings.</p>
        <p>Radiohead's 1997 album, ''OK Computer,'' deliberately defied superficial listening. It was an album-length contemplation, and a bitter critique, of how mass media and technology shape docile, depersonalized consumers, and it took pains over every note as it pondered why alienation festers behind comfort. Radiohead's next album, ''Kid A,'' is due in October, and while it's not billed as a concept album, it's even more introspective, almost begging for headphones and undivided attention. Songs and instrumental passages drift and hover, as if floating within some lonely, abstracted intelligence. ''Kid A'' is half of a two-album set, to  be completed next year by a second album of material from the same recording sessions.</p>
        <p>Radiohead isn't the only band that's not afraid to appear serious; U2, whose previous album confused potential fans by putting a light-hearted title, ''Pop,'' on a set of brooding songs, is to release a new studio album in October.</p>
        <p>Maxwell, whose next album is due in November, can count on longtime loyalty because his albums have a secure place on the bedroom stereo. He has defined himself as something his fans long for: a romantic, thoughtful, sensual and utterly monogamous lover, completely devoted to his partner's happiness. Taking the Marvin Gaye of ''Sexual Healing'' as his model, and merging Gaye's undulating grooves with a touch of Sade, Maxwell comes across as sweet but virile, with touches of mysticism and eccentricity giving depth to his come-ons. D'Angelo's brilliant 1999 album, ''Voodoo,'' gave Maxwell serious competition in both music and persona-building; with any luck, Maxwell will raise the stakes again.</p>
        <p>The paradox of pop is that intentions rarely correspond to results. The most carefully thought out, elaborately realized musical opus may well be ignored or repudiated, while a casually tossed off ditty can turn out to be timeless. Listeners, not musicians, will make the final decisions about what's worth saving. And in the meantime, fleeting pleasures will do just fine.</p>
