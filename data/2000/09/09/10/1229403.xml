        <p>Brian Grazer, the Imagine Films producer, and Ron Howard, the director, last week signed Russell Crowe, star of ''Gladiator'' and one of Hollywood's hottest leading men, to play John Forbes Nash Jr., who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1994. The movie, based on the biography ''A Beautiful Mind'' by Sylvia Nasar, a former reporter for The New York Times, recounts how Mr. Nash, who was 21 when he wrote the Ph.D. thesis that made his reputation, suffered for years from paranoid schizophrenia before miraculously recovering in his early 60's -- without drugs or other treatment.</p>

        <p>Brian Grazer, the Imagine Films producer, and Ron Howard, the director, last week signed Russell Crowe, star of ''Gladiator'' and one of Hollywood's hottest leading men, to play John Forbes Nash Jr., who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1994. The movie, based on the biography ''A Beautiful Mind'' by Sylvia Nasar, a former reporter for The New York Times, recounts how Mr. Nash, who was 21 when he wrote the Ph.D. thesis that made his reputation, suffered for years from paranoid schizophrenia before miraculously recovering in his early 60's -- without drugs or other treatment.</p>
        <p>And what does Mr. Nash think of the choice? ''I think he can play other roles than a gladiator, which obviously I am not,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Now 72 and living outside Princeton, N.J., Mr. Nash said he was surprised that his life story would be fodder for a film in this day and age. And he is a little nervous, he said, about the freedoms that Hollywood might take with his tale -- but he will consult for the film.</p>
        <p>The screenplay, written by Akiva Goldman, who also wrote the screenplay for ''The Client,'' is in the final stages of revision. Filming is set to begin next March, with a tentative release date of November 2001.</p>

        <p>PRIVATE SECTOR  Correction:  September 17, 2000, Sunday  A brief report in the Private Sector column last Sunday about the choice of Russell Crowe to play the leading role in a film about John Forbes Nash Jr., the 1994 Nobel laureate in economic science, misstated the surname of the screenplay writer. He is Akiva Goldsman, not Goldman.</p>
