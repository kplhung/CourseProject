        <p>HARDLY any description of the booming economy fails to include this upbeat observation: Wages have been rising faster than inflation for most workers since January 1996. The boom has lifted all boats, and that is its great social gift.</p>
        <p>But this year, hardly noticed until now, the lifting stopped. Wages are still rising, but no longer faster than inflation.</p>
        <p>That is a troubling development. Nothing has seemed more important in the economic boom than the wage gains it has conferred. High-end workers, those earning more than $80,000 a year, always gain ground. But the pay of nearly everyone else went nowhere for a quarter-century, until the rising prosperity of the 1990's -- and a falling unemployment rate -- finally brought relief.</p>
        <p>Wages have risen 3 to 5 percent a year since 1996, with the precise figure depending on the measure used -- average wages, median wages, hourly wages -- and the particular group of workers measured. The $7-an-hour worker has done as well as those earning $18 or $25. And even now, these ''nominal'' wages, unadjusted for inflation, continue to rise at a fairly steady pace, according to Labor Department data tabulated by the Economic Policy Institute.</p>
        <p>The problem is inflation. A dollar's worth of nominal wages does not buy as much when prices rise. Inflation must be subtracted to know the ''real'' rate of wage growth. A 4 percent nominal raise becomes no raise at all if inflation is also 4 percent. And that is roughly what has happened. The Consumer Price Index, which rose less than 2 percent a year in 1997 and 1998, is now climbing at an annual rate of more than 3.5 percent, nullifying all or most of this year's wage gains.</p>
        <p>''There is no question that you have had constant nominal wage growth, yet slowing real wage growth, which over the last two quarters has been just about flat,'' said Jared Bernstein, an  economist at the  Economic Policy Institute.</p>
        <p>The oil shock is the culprit, and there is hope that it will end soon, with OPEC increasing production enough to bring down the prices of heating oil, gasoline and aviation fuel, and with them the inflation rate. The decision to step up output could even come this weekend at a conference in Vienna. But the oil crisis is in its second year, and an earlier production increase didn't pull prices down.</p>
        <p>If inflation sustains its present pace, American workers will be in a bind. Either they must agitate for bigger nominal wage increases -- making better use of the leverage they have from a very low unemployment rate -- or they will have to accept that the longest economic expansion in American history has lost its lifting power for them. ''We are at a moment of testing,'' said Peter Hooper, chief domestic economist for Deutsche Bank North America.</p>
        <p>MANY forecasters and Wall Street economists argue that the necessary bargaining power is still there. If the inflation rate stays up, workers will indeed start to fight for raises large enough to keep ahead of inflation or, failing that, they will jump to jobs that pay more. The struggle has not begun yet, this argument goes, because most people believe that inflation in the longer run will subside to less than 3 percent, and nominal wage gains will turn back into real ones.</p>
        <p>Such thinking ignores accumulating evidence that American workers are more passive than in the past, and much less able, when inflation erodes their wages, to take advantage of market demand for their services. A host of reasons are cited: globalization, job insecurity, the decline in union membership, mass extinctions of higher-paying factory jobs, an influx of low-wage immigrants, companies that are quick to relocate to lower-wage regions, the disappearance of cost-of-living adjustments. The list continues, with two new observations.</p>
        <p>The 86,000 workers who struck Verizon so effectively last month settled for a 12.5 percent wage increase over three years, plus less tangible stock options and profit sharing. Many nonunion workers have been getting similar wage increases since 1996.</p>
        <p>And the old corporate practice of splitting productivity gains with employees -- often at the insistence of unions -- is fading. Labor productivity has been rising more rapidly over the last two years, meaning that  workers generate more revenue and income for their companies. But the fruits have gone mainly into profits, not wages. Corporate profits rose in the second quarter to 9.7 percent of gross domestic product, from 9.34 percent in the fourth quarter last year.</p>
        <p>''Workers have not yet recognized the extent to which their rising productivity has not yet been matched by increases in nominal wages,'' Mr. Hooper said.</p>
        <p>The great concern, in sum, is that the lift for wage earners from the booming economy is fading, and in danger of disappearing entirely if the oil shock lasts.</p>
