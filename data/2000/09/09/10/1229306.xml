        <p>Maria Capotorto, the designer behind Your Sister's Mustache, a line of home and women's accessories, is giving new meaning to news you can use.</p>
        <p>A former graphics designer, she makes handbags from frayed newspapers that she finds on the street. Ms. Capotorto, who likes to shape decorative objects out of unlikely materials, was gluing and laminating old newspapers to make wastepaper baskets for her apartment when a friend suggested that the same technique would make cool handbags. The resulting totes, which come in two sizes ($38 and $58), are available in New York at Anthropologie. The laminated bags are square with clear plastic handles, and are made of all kinds of ephemera, including magazine articles, pages from children's books and newspapers dating back to the 70's. ''They're just kitschy and fun,'' Ms. Capotorto said. ''And your hands will never be covered in ink when you're finished reading the articles.''</p>
