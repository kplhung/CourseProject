        <p>First Bill Moyers did beginnings, in the television series ''Genesis: A Living Conversation.'' Now he is turning his attention to endings with ''On Our Own Terms: Moyers on Dying,'' a four-part look at options for dying with comfort and dignity. Bringing the subject closer to home, Channel 13 has developed programs especially for the tristate area exploring options in end-of-life care. The Moyers series will be broadcast at 9 p.m. from today through Wednesday; the Channel 13 programs will follow immediately afterward at 10:30 p.m. And still closer to home, in New Jersey, are several related discussion groups. In Morristown, the Atlantic Mind Body Center is sponsoring a Sept. 26 workshop called ''Let Evening Come'' for clergy, seminarians, hospital chaplains and nurses; information: (973) 971-4575. In Jersey City, Christ Hospital is offering a training program for clergy and community leaders on four Tuesdays beginning Oct. 3; information: (201) 795-8397. In Hackensack, Christ Episcopal Church is planning a program called ''Angel's Eve'' on Oct. 29; information: (201) 342-2365.</p>
