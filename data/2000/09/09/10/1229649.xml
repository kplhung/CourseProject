        <p>IN a television season whose big names include Bette Midler, Geena Davis and Gabriel Byrne, all starring in sitcoms, the most promising series belong to Andre Braugher, David E. Kelley and some guy who looks like David Letterman. Their shows are not entirely original; let's be realistic, that is not what most television series do. Yet they accomplish something equally good, breathing fresh life into traditional genres.</p>
        <p>The hospital drama is obviously coming to the end of its cycle, with ''Chicago Hope'' dead and ''E. R.'' old enough in television years (six) to enter the geriatric ward. ''Gideon's Crossing'' (ABC, Wednesdays at 10) gives it a new depth by focusing on one intense, humane doctor, played by Andre Braugher of ''Homicide.'' His character, Ben Gideon, may be softer than Frank Pembleton, the uncompromising detective who was the vehicle for some of the best acting on the air during that show's run. But Gideon and the new show have some similarities to Pembleton and ''Homicide'' that are cause for optimism. Gideon, a widower with two small children, shares Pembleton's soul-searching tendencies. The show was created by Paul Attanasio, a creator of ''Homicide'' (and the writer of the film ''Quiz Show''). And though the medical stories are crucial, with Ruben Blades playing Gideon's friend and hospital colleague, the show promises to replace the fast-paced, ensemble approach of ''E. R.'' with a sharper focus on character and psychology. In most seasons one drama emerges from the buzz of hype as the most intelligent (not the same as most likely to succeed). This season that show is undoubtedly ''Gideon's Crossing.''</p>

        <p>In general the dramas are more enticing than the comedies this year, and another exceptionally promising one is created by David E. Kelley, who may not be a movie star but is the biggest of television names behind the scenes. He created the comedy-drama of ''Ally McBeal,'' but with ''Boston Public'' (Fox, Mondays at 8) he tries to do for teachers in a Boston high school what his terrific dramatic series ''The Practice'' does for lawyers. Like the characters on ''The Practice,'' the teachers in ''Boston Public'' are imperfect, under stress, facing a range of up-to-date problems. It has been 20 years since teachers were television heroes, and then it was in second-rate 70's shows like ''Room 222'' or ''The White Shadow.''  ''Boston Public'' reflects changing times with plots that include violence and a student Web site that scatologically lampoons a teacher. Mr. Kelley's sensibility and writing, smartly attuned to the ambiguity of social problems, should distinguish this as more than a show about teachers.</p>
        <p>Among comedies, there is one clear standout: ''Welcome to New York'' (CBS, Wednesdays at 8:30), set in a television newsroom that is far away, in miles and in tone, from the Minneapolis station that sheltered Mary Richards in ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' Here, Christine Baranski plays the acerbic, jaded executive producer of a morning news program. She hires a Midwestern weatherman (a job David Letterman actually used to have), whose culture shock includes the backbiting and paranoia of his ruthless colleagues. The weatherman is played by Jim Gaffigan, who looks and sounds a lot like the early Dave (same sandy hair, same round face) without the sarcasm. Since Mr. Letterman's company, Worldwide Pants, is one of the show's producers, let's assume this is intentional. Mr. Gaffigan's engaging demeanor, Ms. Baran ski's better-known comic edge and the series' sharp writing allow ''Welcome to New York'' to rise above its unlikely premise.</p>
        <p>While the most promising dramas and sitcoms do not come from the season's most glittery Hollywood names, the most anticipated miniseries does. Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are executive producers of ''Band of Brothers,'' a 10-part miniseries (HBO, starting in June) set during World War II. The setting evokes ''Saving Private Ryan,'' and the producers' cachet has made this among the biggest-budgeted miniseries ever at $130 million. The series is based on the historian Stephen Ambrose's book about an Army rifle company that parachuted into France on D-Day. The soldiers are played by a group of little-known actors, though the various directors include Mr. Hanks and Phil Alden Robinson (''Field of Dreams''). ''Band of Brothers'' is poised to tap into the regenerated hero worship of those who took part in World War II, the spirit that has made the title of Tom Brokaw's best-selling book ''The Greatest Generation'' enter the language as a common phrase.</p>
        <p>Don't anticipate any of this too soon. Because of the Olympics, not to mention interruptions by the World Series and possibly presidential debates, the networks have agreed that the new season will not begin until October this year. Some new series will begin as late as November. In a perfect world, that would give the less promising shows time to whip themselves into better shape. Keep dreaming. And keep in mind that having three new series to anticipate with real enthusiasm is three more than you can find in some seasons.</p>
