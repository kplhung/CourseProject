        <p>ASSORTED FIRE EVENTS</p>
        <p>Stories.</p>
        <p>By David Means.</p>
        <p>165 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Context Books. $22.</p>
        <p>The stories in David Means's second collection, ''Assorted Fire Events,'' take place in towns along the Hudson River north of New York City and in the northern Midwest, two regions of stark natural beauty shot through with the detritus of a waning industrial economy. These are stories that calculate the cost of progress to the human soul. In lean, agile language, Means stages battles between the haves and the have-nots, the lucky dogs and the down and out. There are no winners and no heroes; redemption, when it comes to his characters, does so in the form of a sweet, unexpected glimpse of selfless love -- nothing more than that, but nothing less either.</p>
        <p>''Railroad Incident, August 1995,'' the collection's first story and one of its best, presents two incongruous extremes of suffering: on a desolate stretch of railroad track cut into rock near the Hudson, a wealthy, fastidious man, ''the kind of man who had his jeans dry-cleaned; he was used to unwrapping his garments, chemically processed, creased, charted out and sanitized, from long glimmering bags,'' has come to ''betray himself.'' He's half-suicidal, reeling from a grave financial misdeed as well as from the sudden death of his wife, who'd just left him anyway. He sets off blindly down the tracks looking for ''salvation not from grief but from something he couldn't pin down, perhaps just things he hadn't done.''</p>
        <p>As he stumbles along, he confronts four pieces of human riffraff: scraggly, brutal guys eager to make a mark, preferably a bloody, bone-crunching one, on a world that they feel has discarded them. In Means's subtle mining of the violence that follows, the railroad reflects back on the society that created it: it's a meeting place for burned-out youths looking for trouble, disgraced executives looking for something resembling the end of the earth, even the engineer of the train, a husband and father whose honest labor brings with it the daily possibility of mangling a stray body.</p>
        <p>In Means's stories, the past won't fade easily into memories. A builder's greedy shortcut -- covering over a stream rather than diverting it -- leads a year later to a tragedy in ''What They Did''; a married man in bed with a neighbor in ''Coitus'' finds his mind drifting back to an unthinkable accident which, we learn, is what gives his eyes the faraway ''attractive quality'' his lover is drawn to.</p>
        <p>Many of these stories neatly diagnose some awful, numbed condition of the souls of the privileged and affluent. It's as if characters whose lives have been devoted primarily to the pursuit of pleasure have lost the ability to know what, in the end, has pleased them: ''A year has past. The pain has faded,'' a young widow thinks in ''The Widow Predicament.'' ''What she can recall of her life with Ron has become burnished, ideal, a beautiful relic (or the inverse; the whole marriage pure boredom, the man a dullard, the end inevitable one way or another).''</p>
        <p>Just as often, a story will casually point out the seeds of present violence and vagrancy in past abuse. Several stories offer flashback images of young boys hungry for paternal love who meet instead with ridicule and bullying, like the boys in ''Railroad Incident'' whose flesh Means describes as ''marred and bruised and burned with hard little bull's-eyes from the butts of Dad-held cigarettes.''</p>
        <p>To write fiction of such serious intent without coming off as moralizing takes both philosophical sophistication and stylistic audacity, and Means has these qualities to spare. There's not a cheap emotion or a predictable conclusion to be found in ''Assorted Fire Events.'' Means, whose first collection was titled ''A Quick Kiss of Redemption,'' is constantly pulling back to correct an impression or to offer a plausible alternative, shifting the point of view slightly so that we don't fool ourselves into thinking we've got it all figured out. He never rests easy or settles comfortably into a simple explanation for human behavior, from adultery to pyromania.</p>
        <p>At times, I wished Means would let the sun come out a little more often, or let his lovers indulge in a few more unconflicted moments of mutual admiration. But his bracing realism shouldn't be confused with pessimism. He has an uncompromising, humane vision that makes these stringent, difficult stories almost unaccountably lovely.</p>
