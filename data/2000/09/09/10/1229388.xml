        <p>WHEN the Clinton administration began planning its first  major military campaign, the 1994 American invasion of Haiti, the Central Intelligence Agency was left out until the last minute, when administration officials suddenly asked for help.</p>
        <p>The C.I.A. complied, quickly printing up leaflets calling on Haitians to remain calm and not resist, and using voodoo symbols to help get the message across. When a senior administration official saw the leaflets, he objected, saying that the Clinton White House could not show support for one religion over another.</p>
        <p>The C.I.A. destroyed the leaflets, but agency officials shuddered over the notion of a politically correct covert action.</p>
        <p>This spring, C.I.A. analysts were admonished to avoid any intelligence surprises during the presidential campaign. The lecture came from their boss, John McLaughlin, who later explained that he just wanted to make sure there were no embarrassing gaffes at a sensitive time.</p>
        <p>While a lecture to steer clear of election-year controversy might make sense at the Bureau of Land Management, the C.I.A.'s job is to look for trouble, in order to warn the president and Congress about it.</p>
        <p>''I think it was kind of insulting to the analysts,'' said one C.I.A. veteran. ''We are in the business of surprises.''</p>
        <p>The spy agency has been struggling for its footing since the end of the cold war robbed it of its core mission. But the two incidents demonstrate how, under the Clinton administration, the C.I.A. has suffered from two worsening trends: a skittishness about politically sensitive intelligence and an aversion to risky espionage operations.</p>
        <p>Some officers who have left the agency in recent years say it is dominated by play-it-safe bureaucrats and has become a diminished force within the government.</p>
        <p>''This is an intelligence agency, and it is supposed to do serious things,'' said a senior C.I.A. officer who resigned during the Clinton administration. ''We should not be worried about image and bureaucracy. We are not selling soap.''</p>
        <p>Senior intelligence officials say the C.I.A. has regained much of its strength under George Tenet, who became its director in July 1997. Still, its most glaring recent failure came in 1998, when it was surprised by India's test of a nuclear weapon.</p>
        <p>Certainly, the story begins with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the implosion of the Soviet Union. Lacking a clear mission, the C.I.A. became a target for budget cutting.  The agency's espionage arm shrank, and overseas stations in Africa and Latin America were closed.</p>
        <p>The C.I.A. was further traumatized in 1994 with the revelation that Aldrich Ames, a longtime case officer, had been a Russian mole for nine years. Reprimands in the case  prompted a mass exodus of bitter senior managers. By the mid-1990's, the generation that had run the C.I.A. during the cold war was largely gone, and with them went much of the agency's institutional memory on managing spy operations.</p>
        <p>But the administration's handling of intelligence has deepened the agency's woes. President Clinton's lack of interest in intelligence policy early in his term doomed his first director of central intelligence, R.  James Woolsey. Mr. Woolsey likes to say that when a light plane crashed onto the White House lawn in 1993, White House staffers joked that it must have been Mr. Woolsey, trying to get a meeting with the president.</p>
        <p>Haiti was hardly the Clinton administration's only half-hearted covert action. The most spectacular failure was in Iraq. C.I.A. officers involved in two failed operations against Baghdad say the Clinton administration wasted resources -- and Iraqi lives -- in efforts the agency knew were pointless.</p>
        <p>One action, in northern Iraq, relied on the dissident Iraqi National Congress and Kurdish ethnic groups. It was simply overrun by the Iraqi Army. The other, based in Jordan, called for sabotage and other minor acts of rebellion from the Iraqi National Accord, which was made up mostly of former Iraqi military officers. But Iraqi double agents penetrated the operation, and about 100 of its members were arrested and executed.</p>
        <p>The appointment of John Deutch to succeed Mr. Woolsey in 1995 initially seemed likely to strengthen the agency, but Mr. Deutch soon began angling to become secretary of defense. In perhaps the most significant restructuring in the nation's intelligence community in the last decade, he arranged a transfer of spy satellite operations from the C.I.A. to the Defense Department. Even White House officials acknowledge that the shift has been a disaster.</p>
        <p>Because the Pentagon has first call on the satellites, tactical, short-range military targets have top priority, while longer-range analytical problems -- like monitoring the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction -- get shorter shrift. Many insiders believe that the C.I.A.'s failure to predict India's 1998 test of a nuclear weapon was caused by the satellite shift.</p>
        <p>Fingerpointing over the India fiasco has led to the opposite problem. Gun-shy analysts are flooding policy makers with mountains of reports on every conceivable problem that seem impossible to sort through.</p>
        <p>Political demands from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue have also increased the pressure on the C.I.A. Without an overwhelming threat to national survival like the cold war, Congress and the White House feel free to argue over intelligence on less immediate problems, like corruption in Russia or the growing power of China. Critics in the intelligence community complain that the administration sometimes plays down or dismisses intelligence analysis that conflicts with its policies.</p>
        <p>Republicans in Congress, seeking to block Clinton initiatives, have frequently exaggerated the significance of the same reports.  C.I.A. analysts then find themselves caught in the middle. Gordon Oheler, who served as chief of the C.I.A.'s counterproliferation center in the mid-1990's, has complained that administration officials tried to block him from testifying before Congress on politically sensitive proliferation matters.</p>
        <p>On the other side, Republicans in Congress also intervened when a 1995 National Intelligence Estimate on ballistic missiles concluded that the United States was safe from nuclear missile attacks launched by small ''rogue states'' like North Korea, Iran and Iraq. Republican lawmakers created an independent commission to challenge the  findings, helping revive the debate over  national missile defense.  THE C.I.A.'s efforts to make its intelligence reports more timely and relevant to current policy debates have only increased the political pressures on the agency.</p>
        <p>''We have gotten much more aggressive about getting to policy makers on more issues and tailoring our intelligence to issues they are dealing with,'' noted one senior intelligence official. ''And as you get  closer to issues that are highly sensitive policy matters, you are more likely to experience pressure, and you are more likely to be challenged by policy makers. You do feel their displeasure at times.''</p>
        <p>Senior intelligence officials insisted, however, that they had never changed an analytical report because of such pressures.</p>
        <p>Many insiders say there are concrete signs that the tide has begun to turn under Mr. Tenet. They credit him with bringing back Jack Downing, a cold war legend, who helped rebuild the agency's spy service before going back into retirement last year, and winning budget increases that have enabled the C.I.A. to begin recruiting a new generation of case officers. Some closed stations in Africa have been reopened, aiding in the agency's increasingly successful penetrations of terrorist groups. And senior officials say the agency's risk-taking spirit is beginning to return.</p>
        <p>''If the people who left a few years ago came back today and saw what we were doing, I think they would be impressed,'' one senior C.I.A. official said.</p>
