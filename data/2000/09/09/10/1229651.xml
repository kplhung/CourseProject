        <p>To many voters, but especially to women, Hillary Clinton used to seem like a victim of bad casting. Her attempts at wifeliness, from visiting sick children to gazing lovingly upon her wayward husband, struck people as fake, and her attempts at leadership failed entirely. In the last year or so a very different Hillary has come into focus. Instead of talking about the White House Christmas tree, she talks about important policy issues. Instead of touting the work of others, she touts her own behind-the-scenes accomplishments and seeks a prominent position from which to accomplish more. And instead of those dowdy Easter Sunday pastels, she favors a much more slimming palette of browns and blacks.</p>
        <p>Yet Candidate Hillary isn't going over any better than First Lady Hillary did. The polls show that the white women who ought to be her principal base of support favor her opponent by five percentage points. Reporters who interview New York women about Hillary's candidacy find themselves dragged into weirdly intense discussions about the sexual politics of the Clinton marriage and the proper way for a woman to behave before the public.</p>
        <p>To her most vocal critics on the right, especially those who are moved to write books about her, the reason is simple. When she pretended to be a traditional first lady, they found her act achingly transparent. Now that her personality is on display, they hate her even more, portraying her as everything from an insufferable idealist to a murderous conniver, an embodiment of the feminist agenda that they loathe. But what about the people who support that agenda? Who admired her refusal, back in Arkansas, to wear makeup and bouffants? Who were appalled by her first lady incarnation -- not because it was a fake but because it was a betrayal of their shared ideals? We go back and forth, we interpret and reinterpret the same qualities -- first positively, then negatively. Is she a go-getter or power mad? A strategist or a manipulator? Someone who has been hampered by sexism or who has profited from her husband's career? In short, our feelings about the candidate are as contradictory as they were about the first lady.</p>
        <p>For example, I recently found myself arguing with a friend about Hillary's resemblance to the characters of Henry James's ''Portrait of a Lady.'' (Can anyone imagine Rick Lazio inspiring that kind of debate?) I argued that Hillary was a modern-day version of Isabel Archer, the novel's heroine. Both are attractive, intelligent women who make bad marriages that require them to squander their talents in the role of the gracious hostess, although Isabel's husband is malicious and Bill Clinton seems well meaning, and . . . I was getting tangled up in the details when my friend cut me off: ''Isabel Archer!'' she exclaimed. ''Try Henrietta Stackpole!'' She's a minor character in the novel, an intrusive know-it-all, a classic Yankee bluestocking. The two of them represent the appealing and repugnant sides, respectively, of women of a certain class dedicated to social improvement in late-19th-century America.</p>
        <p>My friend was right. Hillary is a bluestocking, and that is why she elicits these deeply conflicted responses. Bluestockings always have, all the way back to their first appearance. These public-minded women accomplished a lot: they were a driving force behind abolition, suffrage, government assistance, workplace integration. And yet they were depicted in newspapers and novels as joyless, sexless taskmistresses intent on imposing their will on others.</p>
        <p>Hillary is neither joyless nor sexless. She is genuinely devoted to her family, and she has been an energetic force for change at every institution she has been a part of, from her high school to nonprofit organizations to the highest levels of government. But rather than make people feel that they, too, can change the world, her passion for reform tends to translate -- even among professional-class white women like herself -- as somehow nannyish and condescending. Her book, ''It Takes a Village,'' had the earnest overexplicitness of a missionary addressing the lower orders. It spoke to the needs of children; readers felt it spoke to them as children. One might expect that sort of response from voters who had reason to feel threatened by her, but the fact that even those voters who might otherwise identify with her are so put off suggests how little some of our attitudes have changed since the bluestockings' debut.</p>
        <p>Hillary's handlers may debate how she can modify her tone, restate her convictions. But none of that will succeed unless we can get past our discomfort with a strong-minded woman expressing her ideas about our world -- until we can stop thinking of her as a schoolmarm or a Lady Macbeth or even a character from a James novel. Whatever happens this November -- in particular, whether the presidential candidates are able to influence local elections -- the one thing that is clear is that voters' choices will have more to do with Hillary's status as a symbol than with her ideas about policy. And it's not just Hillary's problem; it's our problem, too.</p>
