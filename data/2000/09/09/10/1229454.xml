        <p>FANS of ''E.T.'' were annoyed, but Sir Richard Attenborough's GANDHI swept the 1982 Oscars. It took best picture, best director, best actor (Ben Kingsley, new to American movie audiences, in the title role) and even best costume design. Which is odd for a picture about a man in a loincloth. The story covers Mohandas K. Gandhi from his days as a young lawyer in South Africa to his assassination in Delhi in 1948. This is a conventional middlebrow biography, but the story of Gandhi, whose pacifism changed the course of India's history, is so powerful, and Mr. Kingsley's performance is so precise, that the film holds together. - Saturday at 9 p.m. on Channel 13.</p>

        <p>Errol Morris was only 30 when he made his first documentary, GATES OF HEAVEN (1978), and its absurdist, absorbing, hilarious, unobstrusive style made his reputation. The subject is California pet cemeteries, and it's amazing how much Mr. Morris manages to say about the deepest of human needs through interviews with cemetery owners and pet owners holding photographs of their dearly departed. The film manages to show affection for its interview subjects while it laughs at them, and Mr. Morris, who later made ''The Thin Blue Line,'' among other things, was ahead of his time on the irony continuum - Tuesday at 11:15 a.m. and 6 p.m., Saturday at 7 a.m. and 1:45 p.m. on FIC.</p>
        <p>Bosley Crowther hated THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA (1954). His review in The New York Times called it sketchy, arbitrary and lacking in either plausibility or appeal. Time has vastly improved critics' opinions of this bleak but fascinating film, written and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, about Maria Vargas (Ava Gardner at peak gorgeousness), a dancer in Madrid who becomes a movie star in America but longs to escape. Even Crowther liked Humphrey Bogart as the has-been Hollywood director narrating her story and acknowledged that the other men in Maria's life were ''brilliantly horrible.'' They include Edmond O'Brien, who won the Oscar for best supporting actor for his role as a sleazy press agent, and Rossano Brazzi, as the Italian count who makes an upsetting confession to Maria on their wedding night - Sunday at 2 p.m. on TCM.</p>
        <p>The appeal of QUEEN MARGOT (1994) is Philippe Rousselot's stunning, painterly cinematography and Isabelle Adjani's performance in the title role. Margot is Marguerite de Valois, daughter of Catherine de Medicis (Queen Mother of France at the time, played brilliantly by Virna Lisi), and she is being married off to the future Henry IV of France (Daniel Auteuil) as part of a power struggle among the French nobility. It's the Roman Catholics versus the Huguenots, and the conflict leads to the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572. La Mole (Vincent Perez) - the lover Margot picks up in an alley while doing a little anonymous sexual slumming - becomes all too involved. The film, directed by Patrice Chereau, is gory, sometimes confusing and almost hysterical at times, but it's a thing of beauty - Sunday at 1:30 p.m. and Sunday/Early Monday at 3 a.m. on Bravo.</p>
        <p>It starts with a single seagull attacking Tippi Hedren's pretty blond hairdo and escalates. THE BIRDS (1963) is one of Alfred Hitchcock's winners, a beautifully constructed horror story about nature running amok. Ms. Hedren is a spoiled young heiress, Rod Taylor is the solid, handsome young man who takes her home to Mom (played with unassailable possessiveness by Jessica Tandy), and Suzanne Pleshette is Mr. Taylor's ex-girlfriend, a teacher who should have skipped school that day - Saturday at 8:05 p.m. on AMC.</p>
