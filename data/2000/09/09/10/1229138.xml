        <p>HOLDING your breath in anticipation is rarely a healthy exercise, and in the theater it is usually suicidal. A mere few months ago, an improbably rosy horizon seemed to glow before those rich or fanatical enough to attend Broadway shows.</p>
        <p>That splendid London-born revival of ''Oklahoma!,'' directed by Trevor Nunn; Donna Murphy recreating her peerless comic performance in the rarely revived ''Wonderful Town,'' first seen last spring in an Encores! concert production; and, most tantalizing of all, Angela Lansbury back onstage, and in a Kander-Ebb musical (''The Visit'') to boot: all of these mouthwatering prospects were to materialize in the near future, making the 2000-1 Broadway season look like a gloriously overstuffed Christmas stocking.</p>

        <p>HOLDING your breath in anticipation is rarely a healthy exercise, and in the theater it is usually suicidal. A mere few months ago, an improbably rosy horizon seemed to glow before those rich or fanatical enough to attend Broadway shows.</p>
        <p>That splendid London-born revival of ''Oklahoma!,'' directed by Trevor Nunn; Donna Murphy recreating her peerless comic performance in the rarely revived ''Wonderful Town,'' first seen last spring in an Encores! concert production; and, most tantalizing of all, Angela Lansbury back onstage, and in a Kander-Ebb musical (''The Visit'') to boot: all of these mouthwatering prospects were to materialize in the near future, making the 2000-1 Broadway season look like a gloriously overstuffed Christmas stocking.</p>
        <p>Santa Claus, of course, is known to disappoint. So we shouldn't be terribly surprised to learn that none of the above is now expected to reach a Broadway theater anytime soon, with the possible exception of ''The Visit,'' which in any case will be without Ms. Lansbury.</p>
        <p>But if the lineup of big musical treats suddenly looks skeletal, there are more intimate and eccentric pleasures to be found elsewhere, smaller productions that nonetheless merit great expectations. One hesitates to mention them, for fear they might evaporate before this list reaches print. Kindly remember that nothing in theater is guaranteed to arrive, either dead or alive.</p>
        <p>For starters, there's the return of Edward Albee, one of the handful of working American playwrights to whom the word ''great'' adheres easily and a dramatist who rarely fails to exasperate and never fails to intrigue. Mr. Albee, whose last new production in New York was the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Three Tall Women'' (1993), will be represented this fall or winter by ''The Play About the Baby.'' If you think this sounds like a rejected title for Mr. Albee's most famous work, ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,'' you're not on the wrong track.</p>
        <p>Like ''Woolf,'' this dark cosmic comedy, which I saw in an earlier version in London two years ago, features four characters --  an older and a younger couple -- and a child who may or may not exist. If you go with an open mind and limited hopes for things like a straightforward plot, you're likely to have a good time. This version stars Marian Seldes and Brian Murray, outsized theatrical presences who, if they rein in their penchants for excess, could be fabulous.</p>
        <p>Now consider another theatrical pair, one whose arrival from England demands attention and arguably even fireworks. That's Alan Bates and Eileen Atkins, who will be the entire cast of ''The Unexpected Man,'' the latest offering from Yasmina Reza, who won over Broadway audiences with her pithy and intermissionless ''Art.'' Ms. Atkins, whose natural incisiveness gives elegance to anything in which she appears, has been seen to fine advantage on these shores in the last decade in ''Vita and Virginia'' and ''Indiscretions.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Bates, the most soulful of the angry young actors who dominated British film in the 1960's, hasn't been in a major New York production in 27 years. That was when he appeared in the surly title role of Simon Gray's ''Butley,'' and anyone who remembers that performance will most likely already be ordering tickets for ''The Unexpected Man.''</p>
        <p>You would also be well advised to sign up for the entire season of the Drama Dept., the most ambitious and eclectic of the city's young theater troupes and the creators of everything from a flamboyant deconstruction of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' to the commercial hit ''As Bees in Honey Drown.''</p>
        <p>Its latest schedule tentatively and temptingly includes new works from Douglas Carter Beane, the author of ''Bees,'' and from David and Amy Sedaris, the iconoclastic brother-sister team who bill themselves, not without reason, as the Talent Family. (Mr. Sedaris is the author of the current collection of essays ''Me Talk Pretty One Day,'' while Ms. Sedaris stars in ''Strangers With Candy'' on Comedy Central.)</p>
        <p>TWO months ago, what sounded most promising of all from the Drama Dept. was a new play by Richard Greenberg. This eloquent chronicler of urban neuroses, as in ''Eastern Standard'' and ''Three Days of Rain,'' had taken on a subject he seemed born to tackle: those ultimate urban neurotics and glamorously bad housekeepers, the Collyer Brothers, in ''The Dazzle.'' The latest word, however, has it that Mr. Greenberg and the Collyers have fallen off the schedule. Which at least puts them in illustrious company.</p>
