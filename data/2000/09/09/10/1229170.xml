        <p>A new Web site allows travelers to consult with guidebook authors to plan their trips and make reservations with specialists on  particular destinations. The site, 12degrees .com, which went online in June without fanfare, is not a search engine for discounts but rather is a way to plan customized travel.</p>
        <p>The site lists more than 30 writers who are available for consultation in planning a trip. These freelance authors have had a name-brand guidebook published -- by Fodor's, Lonely Planet or Frommer's, among other series -- in the last three years, according to Steve Bisset, the chief executive officer. These consultations, generally by phone or e-mail, cost $75 to $125 an hour, with an estimate given before the consultation. The authors also provide the site with suggested itineraries, which are available free to anyone.</p>

The authors also provide the site with suggested itineraries, which are available free to anyone.</p>
        <p>In addition, the site lists 60 travel specialists, wholesale companies of 2 to 10 people, who plan and book travel to areas they know intimately. Pallavi Shah, for example, who specializes in India and Italy, operates Our Personal Guest, a custom travel agency in Manhattan. She grew up in India and has returned more than 80 times, and has been planning trips to Italy for a decade.</p>
        <p>There is no extra charge for the service of the specialists, who work on a typical commission basis with hotels, airlines and other providers, according to Mark Campbell, 12degrees' marketing director.</p>
        <p>For more information, go to www  .12degrees.com or call (888) 390-1919.</p>
