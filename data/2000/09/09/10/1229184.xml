        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>I recently had occasion to visit my sister, Agnes, who had received a book from her grandchildren that posed personal questions on each page with blank spaces on which to write the answers. A daughter suggested that each visitor ask one question and record Agnes's answer.</p>
        <p>When the question of sex came up, she said, ''I learned a lot by reading romantic novels, but nothing graphic.''</p>
        <p>''When did you learn the facts?'' I asked Agnes, who has been married 59 years.</p>
        <p>The mother of 13 children -- who also has countless grandchildren and great-grandchildren -- replied, ''On-the-job training.''</p>
        <p>Marge Hannan</p>
        <p>A friend recently visted her daughter, who had just begun toilet training her little girl, who was almost 2 years old.</p>
        <p>When the need arose and grandma placed her on the potty seat, the child said, ''Now I need a magazine.''</p>
        <p>Page Kidder</p>
        <p>SEPTEMBER. MOURN.</p>
        <p>September. Mourn the passing of the summer --</p>
        <p>The season filled with idle holidaying.</p>
        <p>It's back to school again, a real bummer</p>
        <p>(Except for all you parents, who are hooraying).</p>
        <p>Bob McKenty</p>
        <p>One day recently my wife and I went to dine at a rather nice restaurant in Clifton. As we entered the foyer, the hostess stepped away from her podium to escort us to our table. As she turned before entering the dining room, she spotted another patron, an elderly woman, writing in the reservation book.</p>
        <p>The startled hostess went over to the woman and politely said, ''Ma'am, what are you doing?''</p>
        <p>The woman replied, ''Signing the book, naturally.''</p>
        <p>Jim Dugan</p>
        <p>Scene: The fish counter at Shop Rite in Sterling. A woman is standing in front of the fish counter inspecting a large lobster -- claws and antenna waving -- being held aloft by an employee.</p>
        <p>In the shopping cart next to her a very small boy is wailing: ''No Mommy, I don't want that in my house! I don't want that in my house!''</p>
        <p>Barbara Perry</p>
        <p>ALL'S WELL  THAT ENDS ALREADY</p>
        <p>No softly blowing sands</p>
        <p>No brassy outdoor bands</p>
        <p>No charcoaled Sunday cookouts</p>
        <p>No drives to scenic lookouts</p>
        <p>No chlorine in my nose</p>
        <p>No playful garden hose.</p>
        <p>Summer slips away.</p>
        <p>Hooray.</p>
        <p>Bernard Jacks</p>
        <p>I stopped in to see a friend in Montclair and found her modeling an elegant new outfit of nautical design.</p>
        <p>''Where are you going in that, Babs?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>She answered: ''A sailor friend of ours is launching his new sloop and naming it after his wife. But because he's Jewish, he can't christen it so he's holding a 'boat mitzvah.' ''</p>
        <p>Judith Huggins Balfe</p>
        <p>While lounging on the beach in Hawaii, my wife observed that Maui is a bit nicer than our home-grown Long Beach Island.</p>
        <p>''True,'' I said, ''but it sure is a lot more expensive.''</p>
        <p>Without missing a beat, she answered, ''Yes, but look what we're saving on beach tags.''</p>
