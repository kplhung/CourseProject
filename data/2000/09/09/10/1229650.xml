        <p>NOT quite fitting the Long Island profile of a village, a town or a city, Rockville Centre combines elements of all three in a self-contained setting on the South Shore of Nassau County where expensive to moderately priced single family homes combine with a large number of cooperative apartments.</p>
        <p>It is as if the rare appellation ''centre'' was coined precisely to define this place, officially an incorporated village since 1893 but with certain unique aspects that set it apart from other areas in affluent Nassau.</p>
        <p>Foremost among these is a municipally owned electric company with rates low enough to have spared Rockville Centre from Long Island's years of agony over rates the former Long Island Lighting Company charged. Average bills are roughly half of what others pay, the village said. The Long Island Power Authority charges almost $71 for 500 kilowatts of electricity; a village resident would pay a bit less than $38.</p>
        <p>There are also city-style services, including a police department; a municipal water utility, whose presence is proclaimed by a huge water tower on Maple Avenue built in a style that might be called mid-20th-century futuresque; and a public housing authority that tends to seniors and low-income residents.</p>
        <p>The Rockville Centre housing market runs the gamut from subsidized apartments to gemlike residential areas with towering trees and Tudor, colonial and Victorian-style houses selling for well above $500,000, a range unusual in Nassau County, where in many communities housing and economic status are confined to a far narrower band. With an African-American community of long standing, the village also has a racial mix atypical for Nassau.</p>
        <p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre is spiritual headquarters for Long Island's more than one million Catholics, and St. Agnes Cathedral on Quealy Place is where new diocesan priests are ordained.</p>
        <p>People familiar with Rockville Centre say there is a pronounced tendency of residents to stay on and on, upgrading from starter to larger houses and then eventually snugging into one of the many cooperative apartment complexes. Nearly a quarter of village residents are seniors, a high percentage for a Long Island community, and the village has two senior-citizen centers and an array of senior services.</p>
        <p>Mayor Eugene J. Murray, a lifelong resident, who recently turned 75, said many houses he knew as a boy still stand, and shine. ''I have seen many changes, but I have also seen that residential homes have been preserved, and we are striving to keep it that way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The village is currently adding parking near the Long Island Rail Road station and refurbishing downtown areas. A newly installed free-standing ''millennium'' clock in a new pedestrian plaza near the station looks back, in its boxy, nondigital style, to the 20th century rather than ahead to the 21st, befitting the architectural mood of the village.</p>
        <p>Cathleen Quinn Nolan, a lawyer who has lived in the village since she was 11 years old, said she liked the small-town cheerfulness exemplified by meter maids who apologized about giving tickets. ''You say, 'Rats,' and they always say they're sorry,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But parking is a problem, particularly in downtown commercial areas along Sunrise Highway and Merrick Road and at the railroad station, where frequent trains provide swift service to Manhattan on tracks that are thoughtfully elevated -- no loud whistles at grade crossings here.</p>
        <p>THE good rail link to the city and a local public school system that sets high standards for students attract buyers in a housing market that has cooled slightly since last spring, but still sizzles.</p>
        <p>''At least buyers are not entering into bidding wars as much,'' said Elizabeth Souto-Wallace, a broker and an owner of Century 21 Sherlock Homes in Rockville Centre. ''You don't have that frenzy, but it's still a very strong seller's market.''</p>
        <p>Real estate professionals insist a house in Rockville Centre is money in the bank, with high interest. ''I have never seen anybody lose money on a house, not ever'' said Pat Cantwell, the office manager at the Rockville Realty Corporation.</p>
        <p>Most of the village's 6,000 single-family houses were built between 1900 and 1950, giving residential areas a long-settled and comfortable look. They range in price from the mid-$700,000's in the Canterbury enclave, where spectacular Tudors may be found, to the more affordable Greystone area nearer downtown, where prices are in the $300,000's.</p>
        <p>In general, higher-priced areas are in the northern part of the village, and less-expensive areas are to the south. Most lots are from a third to half an acre in size, and garages are frequently detached.</p>
        <p>Co-ops, which account for the bulk of other housing, offer two-bedroom units in the $150,000 to $175,000 range. Ms. Souto-Wallace said co-op studios selling for less than $60,000 may also be found.</p>
        <p>At the 84-unit Park Lane, one of two condominium complexes, two-bedroom units are about $300,000, up $50,000 from five years ago. Two-bedroom rentals are about $1,600 in rental buildings, or about $1,300 in two-family homes. Rockville Centre was built out years ago, and there is little new construction.</p>
        <p>Halandia Court, a 165-unit privately owned subsidized apartment complex, is for the disabled and people 62 and older, regardless of whether they ever lived in the village. Rents are 30 percent of income for singles earning up to $26,800 annually and for couples earning $30,600 or less. The complex has a five-year waiting list.</p>
        <p>The village housing authority manages rent-subsidized complexes, including the 164-unit Mill Court, for low-income families, and 50 units for people 62 and older on Merrick Road. The village helps place seniors in subsidized units.</p>
        <p>Mercy Medical Center, a major employer, is at the village's northern boundary. Molloy College, established in 1955 by the Dominican Sisters, is next door and offers B.A., B.S. and Master of Science degrees. It has extensive noncredit adult education courses.</p>
        <p>The village has seven parks with playing fields and playgrounds and six others, including a village green, for sitting or walking. They cover 140 acres. Ocean beaches are about 15 minutes away.</p>
        <p>Just west of the village, Hempstead Lake State Park offers sweeping fields, picnic areas, soccer fields, a lake and three ponds.</p>
        <p>Village businesses include an array of stores and specialty shops, including Spymaster, which invites customers to ''ask about our new nanny cam.'' There are 10 banks, several investment firms, two seven-screen movie theaters and nine professional office buildings.</p>
        <p>There are also a growing number of restaurants and take-out places, including the First Tortilla Grill on Maple Avenue, a Tex-Mex eat-in or take-out place where a tasty quesadilla with Monterey Jack cheese is only $2.19.</p>
        <p>The village Department of Parks and Recreation has a book full of programs for all ages. A 10-session parent-toddler workshop allows 24- to 36-month-old children to go to school with their parents or caregivers. Fees begin at $90 for residents and $97.50 for nonresidents. A troupe for people 60 and older, the Center Stage Players, enlists local talent for performances at the village's Leonard Sandel Senior Center. The Guild for the Arts, another village group, sponsors concerts and musical performances throughout the year.</p>
        <p>The nearly 3,500-student Rockville Centre Union Free School District includes five elementary schools for grades K-5, a middle school for grades 6-8 and South Side High School. More than 80 percent of the 241 graduates in the class of 2000 earned Regents diplomas. The percentage is among the highest for any school district on Long Island. More than 90 percent of graduates have gone on to higher education.</p>
        <p>THE high school offers a special International Baccalaureate Program for academic achievers. The stringent two-year curriculum requires mastery in six academic groups: English, foreign language, social studies, experimental sciences, mathematics and arts. Successful students earn an I.B. Diploma. Some 69 students earned the degree last year.</p>
        <p>In March, Newsweek magazine rated the high school the 23rd best in the country based on the number of students in advanced placement and I.B. programs.</p>
        <p>A before- and after-school program is opened to students in kindergarten through fifth grade. The morning program, which begins at 7 a.m at the child's home school and includes breakfast, costs $100 monthly for five days a week. The afternoon program, from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m., costs $190 monthly for five days.</p>
        <p>St. Agnes Cathedral School, a Roman Catholic school for pre-K through grade 8, has about 900 students. A small portion of Rockville Centre is in the Oceanside School District.</p>
        <p>By Long Island standards, Rockville Centre developed early. The village and surrounding areas were inhabited by the Reckouackie Indians before Dutch and English settlers came in the 17th century, and the area became known as the Rockaways.</p>
        <p>When the first post office opened in 1849 in what is now the village, postal officials chose the name Rockville Centre from among several suggestions, setting in place the ''r'' before ''e'' spelling that has confounded spellers ever since. The ''Rock'' honored Mordecai ''Rock'' Smith, a prominent Methodist minister.</p>
        <p>Long Island Rail Road service began in 1867, and five years later a school district was established in the village. South Side High School opened in 1892, the first public high school on Long Island's South Shore. The building that housed it has been the village hall since the 1920's, a decade of early housing growth.</p>
