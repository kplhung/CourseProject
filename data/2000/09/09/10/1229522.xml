        <p>Roy Jones Jr. raised his championship belts high above his head again tonight. Across the ring, Eric Harding was left clutching his injured left arm and wondering how close he might have come to an upset.</p>
        <p>Jones retained his undisputed light heavyweight titles when Harding could not answer the bell for the 11th round because of a torn biceps. The decision was scored a technical knockout. Jones (43-1) was ahead on all three judges' scorecards.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jerry Rosenberg stopped the fight after examining Harding (19-1-1), who had injured his left arm during the second round.</p>
        <p>''I threw an overhand left, and he blocked it with his right hand,'' Harding said. ''Every time I threw a left after that, it really hurt.''</p>
        <p>Harding's manager, Al Gavin, agreed with the decision to stop the fight. ''It could have been the end of his career if he had gone two more rounds,'' Gavin said.</p>
        <p>Jones took control in the 10th round, unloading several powerful straight right hands on Harding. Suddenly, the fight was over.</p>
        <p>''If there's anybody better than me pound for pound, bring it on,'' said Jones, who hinted afterward that he might drop down to the middleweight division for his next fight.</p>
        <p>Entering the ninth, one section of fans began chanting, ''Eric! Eric! Eric!'' The mood was altered midway through the round when Jones stopped Harding in his tracks with a solid right hand.</p>
        <p>Jones had come alive midway through the seventh round, the first that he dominated. His speed accelerated and the sound of his punches grew crisper. Harding felt it, too, from several combinations that had him backpedaling for most of the round. It was a major shift in strategy from the sixth, when Jones switched to fighting left-handed but continually missed with jabs and counterpunches.</p>
        <p>Although Jones was the aggressor in the fourth and fifth rounds, Harding continued to pile up points. One flurry in the fifth backed Jones into a corner and swung the momentum to Harding, who followed up with a solid left hook to dominate the round.</p>
        <p>After a slow start, Harding controlled the second round and scored with a few jabs before working inside to land a few solid punches.</p>
        <p>Jones, 31, said he planned to fight for about five more years. He has also talked of moving up a class, to fight heavyweights, and mentioned Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson as possible opponents.</p>
        <p>Jones also said that he has considered dropping down, perhaps to meet the middleweights Felix Trinidad or Fernando Vargas.</p>
        <p>''There are no good fights unless one of the guys like Vargas or Trinidad comes up,'' Jones said before the fight. ''That'll be a showdown fight. But I won't sit around and base my future on what happens with them. I keep my mouth shut. Just tell me where to show up. Felix Trinidad? Let's do it. Anything big. That's what Roy Jones lives for.</p>
        <p>''Let's talk about how to make it happen in six months. Not in 2004 or whenever. Tell me it's Feb. 15, 2001, and I'm there. Boom! Let's fight.''</p>
        <p>On the undercard, Derrick Gainer, who is managed by Jones, stopped Fred Norwood to become the new World Boxing Association featherweight champion in a fight marred by numerous low blows and takedowns. Norwood (37-1-1, 21 knockouts) was a pound and three-quarters over the 126-pound featherweight limit at Friday's weigh-in and would have been stripped of his title had Gainer (36-5, 23 knockouts) not won.</p>
        <p>Marco Antonio Barrera of Mexico City easily defended his World Boxing Organization junior featherweight title with a unanimous 12-round decision over Jose Luis Valbuena of Turmero, Venezuela. Barrera (51-3, 37 knockouts) won the first two rounds and cruised from there to defeat Valbuena (18-2-1, 10 knockouts).</p>
