        <p>As SoHo seeps eastward and NoHo southward in Lower Manhattan, Amy Chan, a women's accessory boutique at 247 Mulberry Street, is typical of the chic shops and cafes that have been moving into northern Little Italy, now promoted by real estate marketers as NoLIta.</p>

        <p>As SoHo seeps eastward and NoHo southward in Lower Manhattan, Amy Chan, a women's accessory boutique at 247 Mulberry Street, is typical of the chic shops and cafes that have been moving into northern Little Italy, now promoted by real estate marketers as NoLIta.</p>
        <p>But while most who enter the trendy turf of Amy Chan -- with its python-patterned pocketbooks and fashionable belts -- simply see one more attractive shop, some have their sights on the site's past, said Candace Mohr, the store's manager. They ''ask me silly questions, like, 'Did you find any bodies here?' '' she said.</p>
        <p>Amy Chan occupies the space previously known as the Ravenite Social Club, a lair from which John J. Gotti, the Mafia leader, masterminded murders, plotted rackets and was toadied to as the Gambino crime family boss.</p>
        <p>The notorious mobster, dubbed the Dapper Don, reigned there from the mid-1980's until his 1990 arrest. Convicted of murder and racketeering, he is serving life in prison without parole.</p>
        <p>But the storefront space has been paroled from the its previous role. The government confiscated the building, and two years ago sold it to a group that sought a different kind of street-level occupant.</p>
        <p>And so, gone is the bunker-like brick facade that hid the Gambino doings, replaced by glass that invites peering in. Gone are the bar and card tables, in favor of handbags designed by Ms. Chan and Chinese-themed lanterns and a reproduction of an Andy Warhol portrait of Chairman Mao.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mohr, who sports tattoos of snakes in a place where the past talk was often of rats, told of ''the weird ones who come in and take pictures of the floor,'' a cracked and patched expanse of tile preserved from the Ravenite days.</p>
        <p>And she and Ashley McGovern, a sales clerk, recalled another visitor.</p>
        <p>''He told us what went on here,'' Ms. McGovern said. ''He said the bar was here, the card tables were there.''</p>
        <p>He told them his name was Joe the Hat.</p>
