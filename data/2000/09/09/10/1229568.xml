        <p>DROWNING RUTH</p>
        <p>By Christina Schwarz.</p>
        <p>338 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Doubleday. $23.95.</p>
        <p>ONE sister drowns in a frozen lake and the other won't tell how it happened: such is the premise of Christina Schwarz's first novel, ''Drowning Ruth.'' Amanda Starkey claims she ''lost'' her beloved and envied sister, Mattie, but after the drowning there's a human bite mark on Amanda's hand. Mattie's daughter, Ruth, who was 3 when her mother died, remembers drowning too, but her Aunt Amanda insists she must be dreaming. In spite of Amanda's jealous guarding of the facts, the truth eventually emerges, revealing a story of deep family rivalries and of the consequences of such determined deception.</p>
        <p>When we meet her at the end of World War I, Amanda is a once-capable Milwaukee nurse. Traumatized by her hospital work, she seeks refuge with her sister in a farmhouse on a Wisconsin lake. A year later, Mattie's husband, Carl, returns from the Army to find himself a widower. His questions about his wife's death go unanswered. Amanda suggests that Mattie ''probably thought it was a fine night for skating.'' But was she wearing skates when her body was found? Amanda won't say.</p>
        <p>The question of who Mattie was, and to whom she belonged, haunts both Amanda and Carl. He dreams of his wife ''sinking through a dark abyss, her arms and legs twisting, a loop of hair drifting away from her face to reveal her mouth, either screaming or laughing, it was impossible to tell.'' Confused and longing for revenge, he searches for clues.</p>
        <p>Grasping, volatile, terrifying but still strangely lovable, Amanda dominates the household and the novel, taking Ruth as her own in compensation for the love she's been denied. She tells her part of the story, alternating with an omniscient narrator and with Ruth, in a voice that is wry and knowing and utterly believable -- until she's caught in a lie.</p>
        <p>''I see I haven't said enough,'' she concedes after we find her in a sanitarium. ''I thought I might omit this part, let it settle silently into the muck where it belongs, but it seems that isn't possible. People want to hear everything, don't they? Spy every strap and pin and hem. It's not enough for them to run a finger along the scar or even to see the knife slice the skin, they must hear the blade purring against the whetstone.''</p>
        <p>Reluctantly, she begins to reveal crucial details. She tells of demanding parents who loved Mattie better and who died of a flu that Amanda unwittingly brought home from the hospital; of her yielding, in their absence, to a man's kiss ''as light and melting and unsatisfying as spun sugar'' and of the disastrous results.</p>
        <p>Ruth, whose troubling memories persist, seems to be drowning in her own childhood until she is rescued by the friendship of Imogene, a queen among girls. Imogene first draws 11-year-old Ruth into a rigged game of marbles, then, when the girls are older, into a daunting social world of dances and powerboating. There they encounter Arthur Owens, who found Mattie's body in the ice when he was just a boy. His charming cad of a father threatens Amanda's role as a mother, as well as her control over the true story of Mattie's death.</p>
        <p>The vivid realism of the novel's setting adds depth to an already gripping plot. The cold blue-green lake, like Amanda's keeping of secrets, is at times a mortal danger and at others a welcome relief. The proprieties of the nearby town, where ''rumors sprang up like prairie fires,'' justify Amanda's reticence even as they restrict her moves. A grown-up Ruth feels a ''keen edge to the wind, a hint of the meanness to come,'' as Amanda bullies her into aiding her deception and the lake claims another victim.</p>
        <p>Schwarz maintains her mystery with an expert hand, arriving at far more than a simple determination of guilt. The novel's end, reached by careful degrees, is too moving and emotionally complex to be given away or guessed. ''Drowning Ruth'' is a remarkable debut: surprising, unsettling and sure.</p>
        <p>Maile Meloy's short story ''Tome'' has been chosen for the anthology ''Best New American Voices 2000.''</p>
