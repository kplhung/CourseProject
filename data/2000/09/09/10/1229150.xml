        <p>FEW authentic American filmmakers have done as much to absorb and employ non-American ways. Yet Philip Kaufman deserves to be regarded as an American filmmaker. ''The Right Stuff'' examined our power, our progress and all our brands of heroism. And it had that old American acid -- irony. But America didn't really enjoy that movie: the taste for irony had faded. So Phil looked farther afield: he made ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' a Czech film done in France; he did ''Henry and June,'' about Americans in Paris and that stranger country called Sex. Again, America managed not to be impressed. But now, I think, he's got it: he has an Australian playing the Marquis de Sade in a picture made in England. Now only the dunces can miss the irony and the charming way in which ''the English movie'' has become the equivalent of an American genre.</p>
        <p>''Quills'' is wickedly funny, impious, blasphemous, very sexy, very tender, very frightening -- for it shows that prison may be a basic state -- but also mischievous, subversive and liberating. It's Phil's best work yet, and don't be surprised if it's a dark-horse hit of the season and best-picture material -- ''The Marquis de Sade in Love''?</p>

        <p>FEW authentic American filmmakers have done as much to absorb and employ non-American ways. Yet Philip Kaufman deserves to be regarded as an American filmmaker. ''The Right Stuff'' examined our power, our progress and all our brands of heroism. And it had that old American acid -- irony. But America didn't really enjoy that movie: the taste for irony had faded. So Phil looked farther afield: he made ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' a Czech film done in France; he did ''Henry and June,'' about Americans in Paris and that stranger country called Sex. Again, America managed not to be impressed. But now, I think, he's got it: he has an Australian playing the Marquis de Sade in a picture made in England. Now only the dunces can miss the irony and the charming way in which ''the English movie'' has become the equivalent of an American genre.</p>
        <p>''Quills'' is wickedly funny, impious, blasphemous, very sexy, very tender, very frightening -- for it shows that prison may be a basic state -- but also mischievous, subversive and liberating. It's Phil's best work yet, and don't be surprised if it's a dark-horse hit of the season and best-picture material -- ''The Marquis de Sade in Love''?</p>
        <p>All of which is more than welcome from a director who will be 64 when ''Quills'' opens in November, and who hasn't had a picture since ''Rising Sun'' (1993), a smart adaptation of the Michael Crichton novel about the conflict between American and Japanese business practices. It was an effective, streamlined thriller, good enough to dispel foolish claims that it was anti-Japanese, but not as personal as many of Kaufman's movies.</p>
        <p>I should admit that Phil Kaufman and I are friends. How close? Well, I've never quite known. But since before ''The Right Stuff'' (1983). His son, Peter, in a very gentlemanly way, once took out one of my daughters. I'm likely to bump into Phil at the Saturday morning farmers' market, where he gives good but gentle advice on the corn to pick, and we'll talk about jazz, basketball, soccer, having children and grandchildren, and so on. It's a San Francisco thing: we live only a few blocks apart and have the same couple clean our houses. I'm mentioning all this because I still remember the awful day, in 1990, when he showed me ''Henry and June.'' This was well before the film opened but at a time when he was in shock and dismay, having heard that the film would be branded with the kiss of death, an NC-17 rating.</p>
        <p>Anyone could tell Phil needed support -- just as America deserved and still deserves to be allowed to grow up and live happily with the NC-17 rating. There ought to be films no one under 17 should see. There ought to be some space for grown-up ideas, for intimacy and danger.</p>
        <p>Well, I didn't like ''Henry and June'' -- it doesn't matter why now. But I told him. It was part of my being too proud or too stupid, or too much the critic, to find other things to say. Not that he was going to fall for evasions. Still, it showed me that filmmakers and critics have their own adjoining prisons. It cooled us, I know, and I hope we both regretted that.</p>
        <p>''Henry and June'' flopped: no film can survive NC-17 commercially in these hypocritical times. And his previous movie, a stunning mix of sex and politics taken from Milan Kundera's ''Unbearable Lightness of Being'' (1988), was more admired than seen. There was some talk in the business that Phil Kaufman, who had been offered nearly every interesting project in the 80's, had gone into a corner in the 90's. Did he want to make European, art-house pictures?</p>
        <p>The fact was that although ''The Right Stuff'' had been a box-office disappointment, Hollywood had thrilled to its facility, the dance of adventure and slapstick, the paean to flight and the satire on hype and bureaucracy. It was also a picture that introduced a clutch of eccentric new actors, Kaufman types: not just Sam Shepard as the Gary Cooper-like Chuck Yeager, but Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, Fred Ward, Lance Henriksen and Scott Glenn. The director's deft handling of ''The Right Stuff,'' which cost far less than anyone thought it had because so many locations and sets were cooked up in the Bay Area, was noticed and appreciated.</p>
        <p>But facility, allied with evident intelligence (educated at the University of Chicago, he reckoned once to be a lawyer), could be read as a maverick spirit, an outsider's aloofness. Kaufman had let it be known some years earlier that he preferred to live in the Bay Area, with his wife (and sometime co-writer), Rose. He had done his time in Los Angeles, but he was unconvinced that a director needed to stay close to the source of power. That independence had its downside. As the writer and first director on ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'' (1976), Phil had had a showdown with his producer-star, Clint Eastwood. Eastwood said Phil couldn't make up his mind. Kaufman had said there were scenes where more than one or two takes might be justified: work longer with a thing and you might find more depth.</p>
        <p>PHIL had been fired and Eastwood took over as director on what proved a very successful picture -- which might have been better still, and might have punctured the absurd myth that Eastwood is a great director instead of just a very effective, rather brutal producer. A few years later, after he had had hopes of being its writer-director, Kaufman ended up with only a story credit (and a nice little percentage) on what turned into ''Raiders of the Lost Ark.''</p>
        <p>Some said he was too stubborn or suspicious of the business, too sensitive or too fixed on a private vision. You could see such traits in his early films -- ''The Great Northfield, Minnesota Raid'' (1972), a screwball western about the James gang; ''The White Dawn'' (1974), a story of whalers stranded off Alaska; ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' (1978), a wonderful, cool, scary remake all done in San Francisco, in which the paranoia of Jack Finney's novel lapped over into the neurosis of New Age people; and ''The Wanderers'' (1979), a romantic gang movie, taken from the Richard Price novel.</p>
        <p>Kaufman can be wry about being both promising and forgotten at 64. His modest company, Walrus -- which is him; Rose; their son, Peter, who is now Phil's co-producer; and a secretary -- is based in the North Beach of restaurants and cafes. For economy's sake, they did some of the editing on ''Quills'' there in the office, with the editor, Peter Boyle, brought over from England. One afternoon this summer, we talked there, and I asked Phil to explain the gap since ''Rising Sun.''</p>
        <p>''Two solid years of my hiatus,'' he said, ''was a thing called 'The Alienist.' A wonderful period novel by Caleb Carr. It had very dark material. But when I set out on it, I said to Sherry Lansing at Paramount, 'Are you really going to do a story about a boy whore who is killed?' And she looked me in the eye and said, 'You bet we are.' We worked on the script, the locations, everything. Two years -- no exaggeration. It was ready to go when the studio said, 'Well, no, perhaps we're not.' There has been a crazy indecision over material. You can do anything if it's violence or horror, but get into the depths of real behavior and they lose confidence.</p>
        <p>''There have been other things. Eric Roth wrote a script about the C.I.A., 'The Good Shepherd,' with James Jesus Angleton as the central character. Zoetrope was going to do that, then changed their policy. That was another year. I did a John Grisham novel, 'Runaway Jury,' and though there hasn't been a Grisham film that hasn't made money, they didn't want to do that. Cecil Brown did a script for me about Mezz Mezzrow, a white jazz musician in the 30's who was also a drug dealer. 'What's jazz?' they said.</p>
        <p>''And there were other things.''</p>
        <p>The Walrus office is crowded with books and research materials, to say nothing of scripts. There was a plan for a movie about the Marvel Comics character Sub-Mariner; the story of Lana Turner and Johnny Stompanato, with David Peoples doing the script; a film about the spy Aldrich Ames. And as Phil comes out of ''Quills,'' he is talking about two very different projects -- a life of Liberace and a screen version of Saul Bellow's novel ''Henderson the Rain King,'' maybe with Jack Nicholson.</p>
        <p>Who would have thought, then, that the project to come through would be the one concerned with the imprisonment of the Marquis de Sade?</p>
        <p>''Fox Searchlight sent it to me a couple of years ago; it was a script by Doug Wright, taken from his own play, which had done well off Broadway. I never saw the play, and I've never read it. But I knew his script could be something. I didn't know much more than the vague outline of de Sade's life, but this was a parable about freedom of expression and, in his case, the inability not to be expressive. It was about sexual urge and hypocrisy, and it meant more to me because I came upon it at the time of Clinton, Monica and Kenneth Starr.''</p>
        <p>PHIL read a lot about de Sade -- from Simone de Beauvoir to Angela Carter -- and was startled to see how respectable a literary figure he has become in France. But he wasn't so concerned with the real figure: fat, over 60, astonishingly selfish and probably impotent. In casting Geoffrey Rush, he wanted a modern satyr, a dangerous rascal, yet an inescapably attractive figure whose most insidious act is to whisper new ideas in innocent ears. Some will be outraged at the presentation; others may see a crucial, modern example of the artist as sick man.</p>
        <p>The drama of ''Quills'' is contained in an asylum where de Sade is at first happily confined. Behind bars, he writes his pornographic books, which are smuggled out by the laundress (Kate Winslet). De Sade has an eye for her, and she is attracted to him, but the conditions of prison allow for their delicious frustration. The abbe at Charenton (Joaquin Phoenix) is an idealist and a humanitarian, but he is in love with the laundress, too. It is his liberalism as a leader that brings a new, vengeful superior, a Starr in excelsis (played by Michael Caine). Thus the scene is set for the final confrontation between regulator and writer. But the regulator is doomed, for this author is ready to write when quills and paper are gone, in the very material of his body.</p>
        <p>The ending is tragic and blasphemous, and it involves an extraordinarily luminous necrophilia scene. Obviously, this is tricky material, the more easily shot in England, where bits and pieces of many noble buildings served to make the asylum, and where the dedication of Kate Winslet, who was the first performer to commit to the film, inspired a cast that includes such actors as Patrick Malahide and Billie Whitelaw in smaller roles. The movie looks and talks like the 18th century, but the sense of nobility and self-destructiveness in the sex and the writing are utterly modern. And the whole thing ripples with comedy. You marvel at the sustained lightness of touch in a film that could have turned preachy, and may yet be forbidden in certain unironic places.</p>
        <p>In the longer view, you can see de Sade as one more of Kaufman's outsider heroes, dangerous to themselves and alarming to society. I wonder where he will go next -- I could still see him finding his kind of saintliness in a Liberace or a James Jesus Angleton. But there's something else odd: Phil loves stories of adventure, remote settings and voyages, but he is an uncommon family man among filmmakers. I can think of no one else who works so closely with wife and son.</p>
        <p>Yet the Phil I try to know is also a touch distanced from even his beloved family. I think he has a profound sense of being alone. It is the perfect basis for a subject he hasn't really tried yet -- the family, the real American family, like O'Neill's Tyrones, and the way in which they sail on another dark sea from the one floodlit with ''family values.'' Above all, what Phil has done with ''Quills'' is help us see our kinship with monsters, demons and those divine surgeons who know the quill can be sharper than the sword -- and so much more enjoyable if pointedly applied to soft skin.</p>
