        <p>IT'S hard to find a hotly contested primary on Long Island, but it would be hard to find any campaign more hostile than the one between two Democrats vying for the seat being vacated by Rick Lazio in the Second Congressional District in Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>The candidates, Steve Israel of the Huntington Town Council and David Bishop of the Suffolk County Legislature, are not making nice.

        <p>IT'S hard to find a hotly contested primary on Long Island, but it would be hard to find any campaign more hostile than the one between two Democrats vying for the seat being vacated by Rick Lazio in the Second Congressional District in Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>The candidates, Steve Israel of the Huntington Town Council and David Bishop of the Suffolk County Legislature, are not making nice. Mr. Bishop has accused Mr. Israel of giving raises to his cronies and selling out to real estate developers. They are hammering each other's claims to be good stewards of the environment. They can't even agree on whether Mr. Israel gave Mr. Bishop his first job in government. And to get their messages across they are spending a combined $750,000 before Tuesday, primary day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop, 35, said the primary was a result of a decision by Suffolk Democratic leaders to ''accommodate'' Mr. Israel and not hold a party convention to nominate a candidate. If there had been a convention, he said, he would have won.</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel, 42, said the assertion that he would have lost a convention was speculative. But the real question is whether the biggest loser will be the Suffolk County Democrats, whose leaders were unable to broker a deal to end the Israel-Bishop contest without an expensive, gloves-off primary campaign.</p>
        <p>The longtime chairman of the Suffolk County Democratic Party, Dominic Baranello, said the party's leaders unanimously agreed that a primary was best for the party.</p>
        <p>''We had two outstanding candidates with a record of public office, and we said, 'Let the electorate decide,' '' said Mr. Baranello, who at age 77 is reported to be considering running for an 18th two-year term as party leader. ''A primary creates activity in the party and gives the prospective candidates an opportunity to meet the electorate. They both have an opportunity to win this. The purpose of a party convention is to designate a candidate and to have unity, not to have a divided convention.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether a primary gives the opposition ammunition in the general election, Mr. Baranello said, ''If they think that the opposition is going to be kind to them based on the way a candidate is selected -- either by the leadership or by the electorate -- they are out of their minds.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bishop acknowledged that the contest has divided the Democrats' resources. ''All the money both sides are raising for the primary could have been spent defeating the Republican candidate in November,'' he said.</p>
        <p>With a budget of $400,000 to Mr. Israel's $350,000, Mr. Bishop, a Plainview native who moved to West Babylon in 1990, has a slight edge in spending. He is also perceived to have an edge in name recognition in the Second District, which includes all of Islip and Babylon towns, the Commack portion of Smithtown, and Dix Hills and Huntington Station in the Town of Huntington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel, whose Dix Hills home is on the edge of the district, said that there are about the same number of Democrats in the Huntington portion of the congressional district as there are in Mr. Bishop's legislative district in Babylon, so neither candidate has an edge in name recognition.</p>
        <p>But according to the Suffolk County Board of Elections, of the 94,917 registered Democrats in the Second Congressional District, 34,964 live in Babylon and only 13,114 are from Huntington.</p>
        <p>The winner of the primary will face Joan B. Johnson, the Islip town clerk. Mrs. Johnson, of Central Islip, is seeking to become the first black Republican woman in Congress. Republicans hold a slight edge in voter registration in the district, but because some political analysts in Washington regard the seat as up for grabs, it will receive national attention from both parties. The Republicans have a slim five-seat majority in the House.</p>
        <p>The only other Long Island primary contest of note also could have an impact on which party controls the House. Representative Michael P. Forbes of Quogue, who last year switched from the Republican to the Democratic Party, is being challenged in the First Congressional District by a lifelong Democrat, Regina Seltzer of Bellport.</p>
        <p>Ms. Seltzer, a lawyer, served from 1976 to 1980 on the Brookhaven Town Board. The national Democratic Party is strongly committed to showing that Mr. Forbes's party switch was not political suicide, but Ms. Seltzer is stressing that although Mr. Forbes became a Democrat, he still casts his votes with the Republicans on tax bills, and that she supports a woman's right to choose abortion while Mr. Forbes opposes it. Mr. Forbes maintains that he is still the same fiscal conservative he always was and that he will continue to guard the environment, balance the budget and reduce taxes.</p>
        <p>The winner will face Felix J. Grucci Jr. of East Patchogue, the Brookhaven town supervisor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel, who grew up in Wantagh and has lived in Dix Hills for the past 10 years, said he has had made a ''special effort to run an issue-oriented campaign that focuses on philosophical differences rather than personal attacks.''</p>
        <p>Two weeks before the primary, Mr. Bishop sent a mailing accusing Mr. Israel of giving raises to town employees who volunteered for his campaign.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Bishop has chosen to dive into the mud with a false attack,'' Mr. Israel retorted in an interview. He said the raises in question were a result of a bipartisan resolution.</p>
        <p>''They were a group of people who work with me in lowering of town taxes for five years in a row, cutting the town debt payment in half, and bringing the town's bond rating from worst on Long Island to best,'' Mr. Israel said. ''They deserved a salary increase.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop did not mention the salary increase during an hourlong interview, during which he insisted that his experience made him most qualified for the job.</p>
        <p>''I'm the only candidate running who has experience in dealing with issues that affect every community in the district,'' he said. ''I have authored laws that have positively impacted every community, such as the revitalization of Suffolk County downtown areas. Thirty-five different downtowns received revitalization grants. Another law I authored established police bicycle patrols, and another will put $2 million towards cleaning the Great South Bay, $1 million to clean Long Island Sound, and another $1 million for Peconic Bay. I've had experience protecting Suffolk County's environment; his experience is making deals with developers in Huntington.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop, a graduate of American University who earned his law degree from Fordham University, added that he is known as ''one of the environmental leaders of the Legislature. I must have voted for easily more than $100 million in farmland preservation'' since being elected to the Legislature in 1993.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Israel questioned that record, saying his opponent was the only Democrat to join seven Republicans in a failed attempt to delete $15 million from the county budget for a land preservation program. And, he said, Mr. Bishop voted to kill the program that provides county funds to preserve farmland.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Israel said, he pressed for a $15 million bond that was approved by Huntington voters in 1998 to allow the town to buy and set aside undeveloped land. And he said he passed the town's environmental reserve fund to buy open space threatened with development.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop brushed aside the charges, saying his opponent had ''manipulated the facts.'' He added: ''If he is going to criticize individual votes, he must give me credit, as chairman of the budget committee, for the county's strong fiscal condition, and, as chairman of the public safety committee, for the historic drop in crime.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel, a graduate of George Washington University who started his political career as a legislative aide to two members of Congress, was the American Jewish Congress's Suffolk director in the mid-1980's. He became an assistant county executive under the administration of Patrick Halpin in 1988.</p>
        <p>''One of my proudest achievements was working to pass a bill that strengthened the Suffolk County Human Rights Commission,'' he said. ''One of my most ironic achievements was hiring a young man who was looking for a job, David Bishop, as my assistant.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop disputed that scenario, saying he had been hired to work for Mr. Halpin and that Mr. Israel was not his boss. Mr. Israel said he was the one who signed Mr. Bishop's time sheets. ''No good deed goes unpunished,'' Mr. Israel said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel was elected to the Huntington Town Board in 1993. He said he was stressing the need to ''modernize our schools and to pay down the national debt and allocate the savings to new priorities, including providing prescription drug coverage to senior citizens. On my first day in Congress, I want to introduce a bill that protects seniors'' from losing their Medicare H.M.O.'s.</p>
        <p>He noted that after he worked to cut Huntington town's debt service in half, the savings was used ''to meet some of our pressing needs, including vastly expanding child care opportunities, building over 350 units of affordable housing for working families, and cleaning our bays and harbors.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bishop insisted that Mr. Israel's primary function on the Town Board is ''simply land use,'' and that he has ''failed to meet the challenge of being a progressive Democrat. He has failed to enact campaign finance reform -- although he says he is the majority leader of the Town Board -- and he has failed to correct his town's deplorable record on affordable housing.</p>
        <p>''Affordable housing in Huntington under Steve Israel is putting working-class folks by the train station and protecting his own wealthy community at all costs,'' Mr. Bishop continued. ''Huntington is the only town on Long Island to have a court declare its housing practices illegal. And the town is still being monitored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development because of its failure to address past discriminatory practices with respect to discriminatory zoning and the creation of affordable housing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel said that to ensure that allegations of discrimination in the workplace are swiftly addressed, he pushed through legislation in the town to create an independent arbitration and mediation process. The vast majority of complaints are now resolved through mediation, he said.</p>
