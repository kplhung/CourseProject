        <p>THE French roots of St. Louis slip into focus at unexpected moments. On a hot afternoon in May, as a radio announcer was warning rush-hour commuters that traffic was snarled on Interstate 270 going through Chouteau Island in the Mississippi River, I was reminded of a time 200 years ago when the river was filled with flat-bottomed boats laden with furs and skins to be exchanged at trading posts operated by the Chouteau family.</p>
        <p>An evening visit to gracious Demun Avenue also carried me back to that era. Jules Demun and A. P. Chouteau, cousins by marriage, set St. Louis abuzz in 1817 when they returned from a trade mission to Santa Fe to tell of being held in chains by the Spanish authorities. It took an act of Congress and a treaty with Mexico to gain compensation for their merchandise.</p>
        <p>Despite these reminders of the past, only one structure has survived from the era of the vibrant society created by the French families who began building St. Louis in 1764: the elegantly restored Basilica of Saint Louis, King, known as the Old Cathedral, near the Gateway Arch. Still used for worship, the church, with its clean lines, subdued tones and scattered touches of the ornate, is a worthy example of early 19th-century French taste.</p>
        <p>In an alcove on the right just inside the main doors hangs an oil painting of St. Louis praying on the eve of his coronation as King Louis IX. It was a gift from Louis XVIII in 1818. The fleur-de-lis decorates the altar cloths, and the altar is flanked by statues of Joan of Arc and St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Although the cathedral was not consecrated until 1834 -- there were three earlier churches on the site -- just 60 miles south of St. Louis, along both sides of the Mississippi, a truly remarkable collection of earlier French buildings has survived. The centerpiece is Ste. Genevieve, Mo., founded about  1735 as a river depot for lead and salt.</p>
        <p>A thriving community of more than 4,000, Ste. Genevieve today is a vast museum of French Colonial structures, with some worthy later examples of German and early American styles as well. Many are open as historic sites, with others still being restored by preservation groups. Private citizens are also restoring -- and living in -- some of the sturdy remains of these houses built by the French pioneers. All of them are a pleasant walk from the Inn St. Gemme Beauvais, where I stayed on a visit in May.</p>
        <p>The Bolduc House, an authentically restored French Creole house, is a gem. Built in 1785 for Louis Bolduc, a Canadian-born fur trader and lead-mine owner, it includes only a few pieces of Bolduc family furniture, including an walnut armoire. But the other furnishings are authentic French Canadian pieces of the era, based on an inventory left by Louis Bolduc.</p>
        <p>The Bolduc House illustrates the construction basics used by the early French in the area. It's a large, one-story rectangular building with two rooms separated by a central hall, surrounded on four sides by covered galleries or verandas -- a practice the French adopted from the West Indies. The entire house and outbuildings were surrounded by a stockade of cedar logs. Although Missouri and Illinois were less dependent on slave labor than Southern states, the outbuildings on these properties usually included slave quarters.</p>
        <p>The post-on-sill construction used for the Bolduc House involved sinking tree trunks down to a layer of rock and squaring them off above ground. For some other structures of the time, hard clay soil provided a firm base. Walls of vertical oak timbers were set six inches apart and insulated with some combination of horsehair, manure, clay and straw. The high-peaked, hip-style roof is supported by heavy oak trusses in a style reminiscent of medieval France.</p>
        <p>It is possible to stand on almost any corner in the 20-some square blocks that make up historic Ste. Genevieve and feel yourself at the center of life two centuries ago. Emerging from a house operated as a historic site, on the other three corners of the intersection one can see houses of the same era, which are still private homes or businesses. At one such intersection, Second and Merchant Streets, private historic homes sit flush to the sidewalk on three corners; on the fourth is what was once the store and residence of Felix Valle, now operated as a state historic site.</p>
        <p>Built in 1818 -- 33 years later than the Bolduc House and 14 years after Missouri became a United States territory -- the Felix Valle House (French accents have been lost over the years) represents a significant shift from the vertical-log construction methods. Crafted of local stone instead of timbers, the handsome pale structure  also has a second floor, which was unusual in earlier houses.</p>
        <p>What impressed me about the Valle house -- when the guide opened the door to its commercial side -- was seeing the counters and shelves where Valle and his father before him had received furs, skins and lead in exchange for goods from Europe and the East. Having just researched the Chouteau trading company at St. Louis, including correspondence between the Chouteaus and the Valles, I could easily envision Felix Valle and his clients talking about the price of beaver skins in London, the cholera epidemics that so often swept through these settlements, or the difficulties of traders wintering among Indian tribes along the river.</p>
        <p>The first Valle in Ste. Genevieve -- Francois -- arrived in the 1740's from French Canada, and many of his descendants became successful, so it was no surprise to find the family's name attached to another historic house. The Maison Guibourd-Valle, a two-story Norman truss house with a wide veranda, was built about 1806 for the Jacques Guibourd family, whose fortunes ran low after three generations. In 1931, the house was sold to Jules Felix Valle, one of the many descendants of Francois. Jules Felix had become wealthy as a stockbroker in St. Louis and married a beautiful showgirl, Anna Marie.</p>
        <p>They moved to Ste. Genevieve and devoted their time and money to restoring and furnishing the old house. They installed heat, running water and electricity. After Jules Felix died in 1949, Anna Marie -- something of an outcast in the genteel town -- traveled and shopped the world until her own death in 1971. She filled the house, just a good-size cottage by today's suburban standards, with museum quality Louis XV, Louis XVI and French Empire pieces, as well as Venetian mirrors, Queen Anne chests, a 1790 crystal chandelier and screens from China. She put jade plates around the light switches and hung portraits of her husband's ancestors on the walls.</p>
        <p>It's all there today, a stunning surprise on a quiet corner of a quiet river town.</p>
        <p>The next morning, it was a return to a more austere setting when I followed the signs through Ste. Genevieve to the ferry and crossed the Mississippi to Illinois, continued to Bluff Road and drove south to the Fort Kaskaskia Historic Site. The town of Kaskaskia (pronounced kass-KASS-kee-ah) was the first capital of Illinois after statehood in 1818. It was a trading partner of St. Louis and Ste. Genevieve until it was wiped out by a series of floods in the late 1800's, and the town and fort are remembered with the historic site, including a park and relocated cemetery, on rolling hills overlooking the Mississippi and Kaskaskia Rivers.</p>
        <p>Nearby is the handsomely restored home of Pierre Menard, surrounded by rolling green lawns, gardens and fields. Finished in 1802, it survived the floods because it was on higher ground just outside Kaskaskia.</p>
        <p>Menard, a trader and farmer, was one of the richest and most appreciated men in French Illinois. A museum on the lower level, below the floor with the family portraits and period furniture, displays some remnants of his comfortable life -- like his pocket watch and a white satin dancing slipper that belonged to one of his daughters. A woolen carpet on display was woven for the 1825 visit of the Marquis de Lafayette, when Pierre Menard was seated next to him at a banquet at Sweet's Hotel in Kaskaskia.</p>
        <p>Menard's large family left many footprints. Not the least of them belonged to a daughter, Therese Berenice, who went out from Kaskaskia to marry a Chouteau and, with him, found the trading post that eventually became Kansas City, Mo. Living to nearly 90, she created her own legends of style and substance -- dragging loose-living trappers and hunters into the church she built and using her Paris gowns as shrouds to bury cholera victims.</p>
        <p>Leaving the Menard home, I drove north about 15 miles to Fort de Chartres, which rises out of farm fields like an ancient mirage near Prairie du Rocher. This town's name brought to mind that the French gave us the name we apply to the vast lands stretching from Ohio to the Rockies -- the prairies.</p>
        <p>The fort was the center of French authority, both civilian and military, in the mid-Mississippi Valley before the Illinois side of the river passed  first to England and later to the United States.</p>
        <p>Today's massive limestone fort is mostly a reconstruction -- having been rebuilt from the 1920's on -- of a fort put up by the French in the 1750's to replace a wooden stockade. The only original building is the powder magazine -- there are also a few original foundations -- but the stone walls and parapets seem authentic.</p>
        <p>While Civil War re-enactments are the rage in many parts of the country, I discovered that the French and Indian War (1754-63) also draws huge crowds of re-enactors to Fort de Chartres. On the day I visited, a group of schoolchildren was acting out a battle for teachers and parents manning video cameras. A teacher told her charges that the English had proved their general ignorance of frontier life by wearing red, a color that she said was particularly distasteful to the Indians, thereby strengthening their inclinations to sympathize with the blue-coated French.</p>
        <p>From her spin on the conflict, you would never know who lost.</p>
        <p>Recalling when the French ruled the Mississippi</p>
        <p>Ste. Genevieve, Mo., is about 60 miles south of St. Louis on Interstate 55.</p>

        <p>Places to Stay</p>
        <p>I stayed at the Inn St. Gemme Beauvais, an 1848 mansion at 78 North Main Street, Ste. Genevieve, (800) 818-5744, fax (573) 883-3899. The main inn has nine suites with a mix of antiques, reproductions and things from someone's attic, for $89 to $179 a night; there are four similar suites with whirlpool baths in an 1850 house across the street for $175 or $185; full breakfast is included.</p>
        <p>There are a number of other inns in Ste. Genevieve. The Federal-style Southern Hotel, 146 South Third Street, (800) 275-1412, fax (573) 883-9612, has eight guest rooms, costing $88 to $138, with breakfast.</p>
        <p>The Main Street Inn, 221 North Main Street, (800) 918-9199, fax (573) 883-9911, also has eight rooms, for $85 to $125, with full breakfast.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>I had a satisfying meal of deep-fried shrimp and a huge piece of coconut cream pie at the Anvil Saloon, at Third Street on the Square, (573) 883-7323, where the bar dates from 1855. Dinner for two with wine runs about $45.</p>
        <p>I was disappointed not to find a good French restaurant in Ste. Genevieve. For a fine French dinner, it was back to St. Louis and the Cafe de France, 410 Olive Street, (314) 231-2204, just five blocks from the Old Cathedral. The menu features traditional French dishes -- chateaubriand, pates, escargot. Dinner for four with wine came to about $200.</p>
