        <p>When Mayor Giuliani visited the Queens Museum of Art in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in 1995 and saw the Panorama of New York City, billed as the largest scale model in the world, he did the same thing that many first-time visitors do.</p>

        <p>When Mayor Giuliani visited the Queens Museum of Art in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in 1995 and saw the Panorama of New York City, billed as the largest scale model in the world, he did the same thing that many first-time visitors do.</p>
        <p>''He looked around, and as he did I tried to wonder what it was like for him to know that he has power over the whole thing,'' said Sharon Vatsky, the museum's director of education. ''But then he asked, 'Where's Gracie Mansion?' He wanted to find his home, same as a third grader.''</p>
        <p>The mayor did find Gracie Mansion, but not everyone is so lucky. The model was last renovated, at a cost of more than $1 million, between 1992 and 1994. As a result, it does not depict the thousands of structures built since then and continues to show thousands that were torn down.</p>
        <p>But updating the model is just one of the improvements that Laurene Buckley, the executive director of the museum, hopes to bring to the Panorama in a new campaign.</p>
        <p>She said the museum must first revamp the model's lighting system, which dates to 1964 when Robert Moses commissioned it for the New York City pavilion at the World's Fair.</p>
        <p>The lighting in the amoeba-shaped room now shifts periodically, and abruptly, from dawn to midday to dusk to midnight. Ms. Buckley said she planned to use $180,000 earmarked from the city Department of Cultural Affairs to make the lighting subtler, among other improvements. Work on the system should begin in the next few months, she said, and take about eight months.</p>
        <p>The next step will be to make the model, which has 895,000 structures, more interactive. Ms. Buckley said she hoped visitors would one day use hand-held computers to download text and audio-visual information about specific urban features, like the Chrysler Building, Native American settlements or their own neighborhood.</p>
        <p>She said the museum would soon hire a design firm to create a strategy for that goal. Then, she said, the museum would start to raise the $400,000 or so required to carry out the plan.</p>
        <p>Once those technological upgrades are in place, Ms. Buckley said the museum will turn its attention to those ''building by building and block by block'' revisions. But that is still years away. Meanwhile, the city continues to shape-shift.</p>
