        <p>AUDIENCE members likely to leave their cell phones and beepers activated during a Mump and Smoot show better think twice. The ''clowns of horror,'' as the duo bills itself, is known to make any such distractions a part of the act.</p>
        <p>Mump and Smoot, who reprise their show ''Something Else with Zug'' at Yale's University Theater Thursday through Oct. 7 after a brief run last year, seldom resist the chance to make sport of thoughtless patrons whose need to unwrap cellophane-covered candy outweighs their consideration for their fellow spectators.</p>
        <p>''Tandy!'' one will gleefully proclaim in the pair's unique language. Then the two clowns are off to wrench a Jolly Rancher from the clutch of an unsuspecting audience member -- or to wrestle away a ringing phone or resounding beeper.</p>
        <p>''The cell phones have thankfully reduced,'' said John Turner, who plays Smoot, speaking from the team's office in Toronto last week. He then noted the possibility that some patrons actually have the calls planted. ''On occasion it seems to be a setup where people will have friends call during the show. They seem to be eager to join in.''</p>
        <p>Mump and Smoot shows seem so spontaneous that people sometimes forget that they are scripted. The team's homegrown language, called Ummonian, is a hybrid of English and sounds made up on the spot. Their interaction with each other seems as off the cuff as their interplay with the audience.</p>
        <p>Yet these are not garden-variety clowns. They are a Kafkaesque distortion of Laurel and Hardy in an outrageously silly world with dark underpinnings. ''Most of the people walk out of the theater laughing, then wondering about the darkness of what they just saw,'' said Mr. Turner. ''That is what I like.''</p>
        <p>''Something Else with Zug,'' which was written by Mr. Turner and Mr. Kennard and directed by Karen Hines, finds Mump and Smoot waiting for their god, Ummo, to make a rare appearance. A genie named Zug (Christian Laurin) eventually pops out of a lamp instead. Granting Mump and Smoot three wishes, Zug uncorks two hours of antics including a loose-limbed spoof of a cooking show whose main courses include audience members du jour.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard and Mr. Turner met 13 years ago in Toronto Second City workshops. Neither performer had any notion of clowning for a living. Mr. Kennard had acted since he was 12, which gave him a leg up on his partner. ''I basically did nothing,'' said Mr. Turner, whose various stabs at work included selling frying pans door to door. ''Tried a few universities but had no idea what I wanted to do really.''</p>
        <p>Their first show, ''Jump the Gun,'' had its premiere in Toronto in May 1988. Since then they have performed across Canada and the United States in ''Something'' (1989), ''Caged'' (1990), ''Ferno'' (1992), ''Tense'' (1997) and ''Something Else with Zug'' (1998). They've performed Off Broadway, in festivals in Israel, at La Jolla Playhouse in California and at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>The improvisational nature of their shows keeps Mump and Smoot fresh, something they would not likely experience in more traditional theater pieces, Mr. Turner said.</p>
        <p>''Just when we've done a show 100 times and you think you've seen it all, you have some new thing going on with the audience,'' he said. ''It keep us on our toes.''</p>
        <p>''Something Else with Zug'' runs Thursday through Oct. 7 in the University Theater, 222 York Street, New Haven; (203) 432-1234. Performances are Mondays at 7 p.m., and Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., with the exception of Sept. 23 and Oct. 4, when there are 2 p.m. matinees only. Tickets range in price from $10 to $36.</p>
