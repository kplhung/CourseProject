        <p>The MetroStars lost to the New England Revolution, 4-3, tonight at Foxboro Stadium and wound up improving from the worst record in Major League Soccer last season to the third best this year.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars began the night with a possibility of earning the top playoff seeding, but needed to win and have Chicago and Kansas City lose. The MetroStars' loss, combined with a victory by Chicago and a tie by Kansas City, gave them the No. 3 seeding.</p>
        <p>They will open the playoffs on Friday against Dallas at Giants Stadium. The MetroStars won both their games against the Burn this season: 2-1 at Giants Stadium and 6-4 in Dallas, a game in which Clint Mathis scored five goals.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars, the Eastern Division champions, finished 17-12-3 with 54 points after going 7-25 last year, worst among the league's 12 teams.</p>
        <p>But they may have lost Lothar Matthaus for another extended period. Matthaus left tonight's game in the 21st minute with a hamstring injury, the same ailment that previously kept him out of action for six weeks.</p>
        <p>''It's the nerve in the muscle,'' Matthaus said. ''I don't need to go to the doctor to tell me what it is. I know what it is. It's the same problem I had before.''</p>
        <p>Alex Comas scored all of the MetroStars' goals. The Revolution won when Joe Franchino's second goal of the game -- and the season -- broke a 3-3 tie at 67 minutes 17 seconds.</p>
        <p>One pleasant development for the MetroStars: they no longer have to share goalkeeper Paul Grafer with the Long Island Rough Riders, who were eliminated from the A-League playoffs on Friday night with a 2-1 loss to the Toronto Lynx.</p>
        <p>''It was bittersweet, but it was devastating to me because the Rough Riders are my team,'' said Grafer, who was in goal for the Rough Riders on Friday. ''The good thing is that now I can concentrate playing for one team.''</p>
        <p>Grafer made his first start for the Metrostars on Tuesday night and committed what he called ''a couple of bloopers,'' but for the most part, he made the right decisions. Tonight his defenders made numerous mistakes. Loose marking and poor decisions by defenders were the norm tonight, the regular-season finale for both teams. There were mistakes galore at both ends and the forwards capitalized, except for Mathis, who appeared to be out of sync.</p>
        <p>''In reality, this was a game for the spectators,'' MetroStars Coach Octavio Zambrano said.</p>
        <p>Mathis had missed several good opportunities in the previous game, a 2-1 victory over Miami, but he had an embarrassing moment tonight. Zambrano did his best to help Mathis by allowing him to take a penalty kick, but Mathis missed wide left in the 21st minute, when it was tied, 1-1.</p>
        <p>While Mathis is in a funk, Comas appears to be in a groove. His first goal, in the 15th minute, tied it at 1-1; his second, in the 34th minute, gave the MetroStars a 2-1 lead; and his third, in the 47th minute, tied it at 3-3.</p>
        <p>Comas's first goal came after he intercepted a pass by John Harkes inside the penalty area. His second came on a left-footed shot from 15 yards after a long pass by Steve Jolley. His third came on a strong shot from inside the penalty area after a pass by Petter Villegas.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>LOTHAR MATTHAUS was replaced by DAHIR MOHAMMED, who was called up from the A-League's Long Island Rough Riders. ROY MYERS and ORLANDO PEREZ sat out one-game suspensions, and THOMAS DOOLEY strained a hamstring in practice on Friday.</p>
