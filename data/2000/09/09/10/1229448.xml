        <p>John W. Lavelle, the Democratic Party chairman on Staten Island, has put together an impressive list of supporters and a formidable operation in his first campaign for public office.</p>
        <p>In his race for a seat in the State Assembly, Mr. Lavelle has the endorsements of all the Democratic officials on Staten Island, as well as support from most of the Democrats running for mayor next year.</p>
        <p>Still, a landslide victory by Mr. Lavelle in Tuesday's primary is by no means a foregone conclusion. Mr. Lavelle, a 51-year-old insurance executive who took the reins of the party on Staten Island a year ago,  faces two opponents in the primary in the 59th Assembly District, and no one is taking anything for granted.</p>
        <p>One opponent is Raymond G. Jorgensen, a Democratic district leader who also has a long list of endorsements. Mr. Jorgensen is a shop steward with Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of America, and has a large number of labor groups behind him.</p>
        <p>The third candidate is the Rev. Franklin M. Hurd, the pastor of the Calvary Worship Center, a nondenominational church on Staten Island's north shore. Mr. Hurd has also been active in the party as a member of the Democratic Committee on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lavelle is perceived as the clear front-runner. In addition to the political endorsements, he has raised more than $55,000, far outpacing the $20,000 raised my Mr. Jorgensen and the $14,000 collected by Mr. Hurd.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lavelle, who works for Metropolitan Life, became the Democratic Party chairman a year ago after his predecessor, Robert J. Gigante, was elected a State Supreme Court justice. Mr. Lavelle, the only one of the five Democratic Party chairmen in New York City who has never held public office, has said joining the Assembly would give him more political clout.</p>
        <p>He said at the time of his installation as party chairman that he had no interest in holding elective office.</p>
        <p>But when Elizabeth A. Connelly, the assemblywoman from the north shore, announced in April that she would not seek re-election after 27 years in office, several Democrats -- including Mr. Lavelle -- expressed interest in the seat. Initially, Mrs. Connelly and other Staten Island Democratic leaders had expressed support for another candidate, Michael J. Cusick, an aide to Senator Charles E. Schumer and former chief of staff to Assemblyman Eric N. Vitaliano.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cusick, whose father died shortly before the party held its nominating meetings, ultimately chose not to run, leaving many in the party disappointed. And many were disappointed that Mr. Lavelle, according to several Democratic officials on the island, pushed his own candidacy even though a consensus seemed to be developing around Mr. Cusick before he decided not to run.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lavelle called the criticism of that episode ''something only the media cares about.'' He added that when he met with voters, they were more concerned with issues like access to the Staten Island waterfront. ''If you drive around the north shore, you will see there is no access to the waterfront area,'' Mr. Lavelle said. ''People can't even fish there, and there is no real development.''</p>
        <p>He also said the district needed more state money for school construction. ''We have a big problem with overcrowded schools, and people are more concerned about what the state is going to do about that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jorgensen, 45, also wants better financing for schools in the district, and he stresses the need for more comprehensive campaign-finance reform. He also said the Assembly should be more aggressive in encouraging competition among electric companies, which could help lower Staten Islanders' electricity bills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hurd, too, has made increasing state funds for public schools on Staten Island -- as well as building more schools -- the major plank in his platform.</p>
        <p>The 59th Assembly District includes many of the neighborhoods along the north shore, including the St. George area near the Staten Island Ferry terminal and West Brighton, Mariners Harbor and Port Richmond. While Staten Island is a predominantly white borough, the north shore is far more diverse. In the 1990 census, the Assembly district was 63 percent non-Hispanic white, about 20 percent black, 13 percent Hispanic and nearly 4 percent Asian.</p>
        <p>What most politicians agree on is that the north shore's black population has expanded significantly since then, largely because Liberian and Nigerian immigrants have moved in.</p>
        <p>For that reason, few are certain what the impact of Mr. Hurd's candidacy could be. Mr. Hurd, 50, who is black, is expected to receive some level of support from the island's black voters, as well as from other Staten Islanders who attend his church.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people don't feel so strongly about John Lavelle,'' said Mr. Hurd, who added that many Democrats were unhappy about the way Mr. Cusick's candidacy was treated.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Hurd and Mr. Jorgensen believe that in a district where turnout is expected to be particularly low, victory will most likely go to the candidate who best gets his supporters to the polls on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''No one should be underestimated,'' Mr. Jorgensen said. ''In a race like that, no one candidate is more competitive than another.''</p>
