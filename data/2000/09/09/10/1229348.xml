        <p>MY son and I were playing in Riverside Park, reveling in the sunshine and the green, when a shriek rang out. From the corner of my eye I saw a mother in distress, muttering wildly. She had grabbed her toddler and bent down to admonish a small boy of maybe 3.</p>
        <p>''No meat,'' she was saying to the child, her voice quavering and loud. ''She doesn't eat meat. You cannot, cannot give her meat.''</p>

        <p>MY son and I were playing in Riverside Park, reveling in the sunshine and the green, when a shriek rang out. From the corner of my eye I saw a mother in distress, muttering wildly. She had grabbed her toddler and bent down to admonish a small boy of maybe 3.</p>
        <p>''No meat,'' she was saying to the child, her voice quavering and loud. ''She doesn't eat meat. You cannot, cannot give her meat.''</p>
        <p>As my heart rate turned to normal after listening to her screams, I quickly assessed the situation.</p>
        <p>The two toddlers had been playing. The little boy had given the little girl a piece of his hamburger, perhaps in a courtly gesture of friendship. Big mistake. This mommy and this baby could not, would not, should not eat meat.</p>
        <p>Somebody on the park bench, presumably an acquaintance, murmured something about their being a family of committed vegetarians.</p>
        <p>The little boy's chagrined and red-faced mother silently walked over and took his hand. The two women exchanged not a word. The evil meat was wrested from the hand of the tiny vegetarian. She looked about 2 years old and seemed none the worse for her ordeal.</p>
        <p>I call it ''the hover factor.'' In New York, especially Manhattan, people often monitor and maneuver so many aspects of their children's lives that it becomes ridiculous. And nowhere is this neurosis more apparent than on the playground, when children are thrown together with strangers from many different backgrounds.</p>
        <p>Think of the possibilities for intrigue and confrontation. The sand in the face. The errant softball. The tricycles, dolls and play strollers to be fought over. The jockeying for the swings or the slide. The lures of forbidden food and drink.</p>
        <p>Most parents and their children operate with a certain kindness and live-and-let-live atttitude. But I have seen or heard tales of parents' chasing children who casually picked up a toy belonging to their child. Or parents who chastise children whose parents or caretakers are nearby but are outraged by the suggestion that their child is misbehaving.</p>
        <p>These superparents, among the many irritations of city life, are back in full force after the summer lull, fretting simultaneously about private school acceptances and the ownership of Elmo dolls.</p>
        <p>''I think people do get overinvolved,'' said my friend Anne, a novelist, the mother of a 2-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl and a veteran of playgrounds around the city.</p>
        <p>''There are these overprotective Manhattan parents who think of their kids as gods or goddesses and don't even see other children,'' Anne said. ''It's very ideological. It's like joining an intense sect. Everyone has their own ideas about discipline and sharing and diet. So there's no agreement on what playground etiquette is.</p>
        <p>''I think in New York kids become a fetish object,'' she said. ''I think parents want to give their children the perfect childhood: no missing toys, no accidents, no hitting.''</p>
        <p>The other day, I saw a father bark at a toddler who curiously approached his child's empty carriage. Then there was the time when a father stood by silently when a boy of 9 or 10 repeatedly shouted that my 2-year-old was trying to steal his bike. When the boy asked his father if he had overreacted, when he realized that I was right there telling my son not to touch the bike, the father replied, ''I don't know.''</p>
        <p>''I'd say it's split 50-50 between people trying to teach their kids to be nice and people who are hovering, overprotective and nasty,'' said my friend Lisa. She lives in Inwood and her daughter will be 3 in January.</p>
        <p>''A little boy hit my daughter in the head with a book and took away the book she was reading,'' Lisa recalled of a recent incident on the Upper West Side. ''I said, 'I'm sure he didn't mean to hurt you, sweetie.' His father came marching over and said, 'Of course he didn't mean to hurt her,' and picked him up and walked away.''</p>
        <p>''I think children are trophies,'' Lisa said. ''They're not children anymore.</p>
        <p>''I call it the 'have it all syndrome.' It's all about, 'I had my career and now I have a child, too.' ''</p>
        <p>It is children as trophies and fetish objects, but it is also just old-fashioned stress.</p>
        <p>Studies are trickling in showing what a lot of us already know: the price for the robust economy is that people are working like dogs. They are spending it as fast as they make it, they do not have enough time with their families and they still want everything to be perfect. So even an outing on the swings becomes a situation of watching and worrying.</p>
        <p>Maybe in a gentler time, the clash between the meat family and the vegetable family would have been at a lower volume. The two mothers could have used the opportunity to talk about differences and how to say, ''No thank you.''</p>
        <p>What a thought. A playground without attitude.</p>
