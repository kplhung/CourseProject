        <p>A STAR CALLED HENRY: Volume 1 of 'The Last Roundup,' by Roddy Doyle. (Penguin, $14.) The first novel in a planned trilogy recounts the coming of age of Henry Smart, born into wretched poverty in the Dublin slums at the turn of the century and caught up as a teenager in the 1916 Easter Rebellion. Before long he is enlisted by Michael Collins to recruit a rebel army by day and assassinate the movement's enemies by night. This ''witty, furious and bitingly detailed story,'' chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 1999, plays subversive tricks with history as it punctures Ireland's national legend, Richard Eder wrote in these pages.</p>
        <p>A RAGE TO LIVE: A Biography of Richard and Isabel Burton, by Mary S. Lovell. (Norton, $19.95.) The author employs persuasive new material in her partisan account of an eminent Victorian couple who offended just about everyone with their many exploits (real and imagined). Last year our reviewer, James R. Kincaid, called this ''an extraordinary biography.''</p>
        <p>THE FENCING MASTER, by Arturo Perez-Reverte. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) This novel, set in Madrid in 1868, revolves around one of Spain's last remaining fencing masters, who becomes reluctantly involved in political intrigue after an exotic woman hires him as an instructor. '' 'The Fencing Master' is a splendid performance,'' Walter Satterthwait wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>INCIDENTS IN THE LIFE OF A SLAVE GIRL: Written by Herself, by Harriet A. Jacobs. Edited by L. Maria Child. New edition edited by Jean Fagan Yellin. (Harvard University, $16.95.) This 1861 slave narrative, long thought to be either a novel or a ghostwritten autobiography but authenticated in 1981 by Yellin, charts the harrowing sexual exploitation of its narrator. The result is ''one of the major works of Afro-American literature,'' Henry Louis Gates Jr. said here in 1987.</p>
        <p>FASTER: The Acceleration of Just About Everything, by James Gleick. (Vintage, $14.) From day-trading mania to a Japanese restaurant that charges by the minute, this fact-filled book surveys today's hyperdriven society, as well as the pitfalls of ever-greater speed and connectedness. The result is a ''nimble, smart, often funny and -- best of all -- fast'' road trip on ''the autobahn of modern life,'' Barbara Ehrenreich said here in 1999.</p>
        <p>COME BACK, LOLLY RAY, by Beverly Lowry (Louisiana State University, $15.95.) The heroine of this 1976 novel is Lolly Ray Lasswell, a virtuoso high school majorette from a Mississippi trailer park who enchants -- and later outrages -- the residents of her small hometown. ''The flashes of Flannery O'Connor-like toughness are gratifying to the core,'' Joe David Bellamy wrote here. ''Lowry's imagination proves sound and patient.''</p>
        <p>MY DATE WITH SATAN: Stories, by Stacey Richter. (Scribner, $11.) These tales, populated by rock stars, metalheads and the Prince of Darkness himself, are bound together by an awareness of the common humanity underlying our chosen personas, however eccentric they may be. ''Sometimes very funny, sometimes too bizarre for their own good,'' the stories display ''a refreshingly original vision, reminding us at every turn that our surfaces rarely reflect the depths of our human reality,'' Elizabeth Gleick wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>CATFISH AND MANDALA: A Two-Wheeled Voyage Through the Landscape and Memory of Vietnam, by Andrew X. Pham. (Picador USA, $14.) The author, who fled Vietnam with his parents as a child, describes his yearlong 4,000-mile bicycle trip up the Pacific Coast of the United States and on through Japan and finally Vietnam, where he embarks on a painful parallel journey into his family's past. ''At its finest moments, his narrative becomes a meditation on the state of loneliness that is everyone's lot in the modern world,'' Adam Goodheart wrote in these pages last year. In South Wind Changing, by Jade Ngoc Quang Huynh (Graywolf, $16), a Vietnamese refugee tells of his ordeal in a forced-labor camp during the war, his harrowing escape and his struggle to create a new life in America. His account ''achieves an unlikely, powerful blending of lyricism with straightforward descriptions of cruelty,'' George Packer said here in 1994.</p>
        <p>WHY SHE LEFT US, by Rahna Reiko Rizzuto. (Harper Perennial, $13.) This novel, featuring four different narrators, follows three generations of a Japanese-American family whose members were interned during World War II. Last year our reviewer, Sarah Saffian, praised the ''simple, lyrical beauty of the language.''</p>
