        <p>Dick Cheney, who helped lead Gerald R Ford's campaign against Jimmy Carter in 1976 presidential election, devised a strategy that resembles the one Vice Pres Al Gore seems to be using against Gov George W Bush today (S)</p>

        <p>During the 1976 presidential election, when Gerald R. Ford was trying to fend off a challenge by Jimmy Carter, Mr. Ford's White House chief of staff, Dick Cheney, helped draw up the defense plan.</p>
        <p>So would that old plan provide some insight into what Mr. Cheney might now be telling his running mate, Gov. George W. Bush?</p>
        <p>The plan is not available, if it ever existed on paper. But after the election, Mr. Cheney wrote a lengthy paper on how Mr. Ford ran the race and that paper is at the Ford presidential library in Ann Arbor, Mich.</p>
        <p>This is what Mr. Cheney was advocating 24 years ago:</p>
        <p>Erode Mr. Carter's support by portraying him as not experienced enough to be president. Lure him into debates that leave him appearing ''fuzzy and indecisive'' and out of his depth when asked for ''specific views on major national issues.'' Exploit perceptions by some voters that he is arrogant, lacks humility and tries to be ''all things to all men.''</p>
        <p>''We believed,'' Mr. Cheney had said, ''that support was susceptible of erosion once the public came to know him better.''</p>
        <p>Whoa! Isn't that Al Gore's plan?</p>
