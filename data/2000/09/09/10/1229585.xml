        <p>Rope Burns</p>
        <p>Stories From the Corner.</p>
        <p>By F. X. Toole.</p>

        <p>THERE aren't many people left who can testify to the authenticity of the stories in Francis Xavier Toole's first short-story collection, ''Rope Burns.'' For better or worse (and if we were to judge the fate of most of Toole's characters, it's hard not to say worse), the world of professional boxing is rapidly disappearing in this country. Toole, a 70-year-old former boxer, trainer and corner man -- someone who jumps in a prizefighter's corner between rounds with a bucket, a sponge and advice -- has written what amounts to a series of elegies for fighters with names like Adolph Dashiki Jones, Cuba Kid Babaloo, Henry Puddin' Pye and Fightin' Maggie Fitzgerald, as well as for their trainers, old Irishmen with names like Con Flutey, Frankie Dunn and Joseph Mary McGee, men who get so close to their fighters they earned the right to say ''we,'' as in ''we fought,'' ''we're gonna fight,'' ''we won,'' ''we got beat.''</p>
        <p>Toole's corner men dispense life lessons to their fighters. ''Boxing,'' says one, ''is an unnatural act. . . . Instead of runnin' from pain, which is the natural thing in life, in boxing you step to it, get me?'' They also perform practical services. ''My job,'' says another corner man, an ace cut man, ''is to stop blood so the fighter can see enough to keep on fighting. I do that, maybe I save a boy's title. I do that one little thing, and I'm worth every cent they pay me. I stop the blood and save the fight, the boy loves me more than he loves his daddy.''</p>
        <p>''I love boxing,'' one of Toole's corner men says, ''almost as much as I love the sacraments.'' Some of his other characters are not so devout; there is, for instance, the trainer who pleads with the patron saint of hopeless cases: ''Intercede for me, Jude Thaddeus. Though I hate God.'' The deity, however, is in the details of Toole's stories -- in the gyms, auditoriums and hotels where the fighters and trainers spend their professional lives.</p>
        <p>Toole's prose is sharp and jablike, and at its best comes at you with the rhythm of a good gym fighter working on the speed bag. Toole has a talent for illuminating the thoughts of the near illiterate but streetwise: ''We was brought to Atlantic City to be the opponent. Opponent in the fight game mean the one suppose to lose.'' Opponents have to eat in places with ''steam coming up and grease all over. Hot dogs and dried-out fish and chicken fried near to black. Cold pork chops all bone and fat. Food be dead.'' Toole also has a talent for giving the staccato rhythm of a fight through men who see it from the corners: ''Reggie keep on putting a hurt on the boy. I yell to Reggie to relax and have fun. . . . Boy never been in this water. Big strong boy, and he tough, he gain weight, like Reggie, but he tired from all that missing. . . . He taking so many punches, he think he be fighting a drag queen with a purse.''</p>
        <p>The best stories in ''Rope Burns'' concern men and women who manage to somehow scratch out a split decision in a life that always seems to have height, reach and a 20-pound weight advantage over them. ''Fightin in Philly'' is a lacerating account of how desire to excel in the ring drains a man for life outside it. (''Most thought the game was corrupt because of the money. Con saw it otherwise, that there was money because of the corruption.'') In ''The Monkey Look,'' a journeyman trainer gets revenge for an arrogant champ in poetic fashion. (''Fans think boxing is about being tough. For members of the fancy, the fight game is about getting respect.'') ''Million $$$ Baby'' is an improbable but ultimately persuasive story of the rise and tragic fall of the first great female boxer.</p>
        <p>Only the title story, the book's longest, doesn't land flush. A novella about a would-be Olympian trying to fight his way out of the Los Angeles ghetto in the supercharged atmosphere before the Rodney King verdict, ''Rope Burns'' builds up too much intensity to be satisfyingly resolved by an explosion of violence that seems forced. Longer fiction seems to stretch Toole's modest though solid gifts as a storyteller, and the unlikely combination of cool narrative and wild Irish sentimentalism that sustains the shorter stories doesn't hold together. Still, this is an impressive collection, not bad for a kid who just turned pro.</p>
