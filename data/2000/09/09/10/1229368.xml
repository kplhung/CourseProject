        <p>When plans were announced last year for a 12-plex cinema at 106 Court Street, neighbors welcomed the idea. Still, some people worried about late-night noise and crowds in the quiet neighborhood, and wanted assurances of no after-midnight screenings. Residents say no promises were made, but that there was an understanding.</p>
        <p>But since opening in July, Regal Cinemas of Knoxville, Tenn., has shown weekend movies starting as late as 12:40 a.m.</p>
        <p>''It was a verbal pledge,'' said Judy Stanton, executive director of the Brooklyn Heights Association, whose members met with Regal officials last year. ''They didn't have a contract with this neighborhood, but they had an understanding.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stanton said residents were told it ''would be a neighborhood theater that could successfully draw upon brownstone residents.''</p>
        <p>She said executives agreed ''not to show films that let out after midnight, with very few exceptions.'' She said the company had also reneged on its promise to show independent films, but did keep a pledge not to show ''urban action'' movies.</p>
        <p>Last Friday and Saturday, six movies were scheduled to end at 2 a.m. or later, with some, like ''The Art of War,'' beginning as late as 12:40 a.m.</p>
        <p>''It's our desire to work with the neighborhood association,'' said Dick Westerling, a Regal vice president.</p>
        <p>Would that include changing the schedule?</p>
        <p>''I couldn't answer that with a yes or no,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Westerling said he would look into whether there were any understandings with residents about the theater's operation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stanton said her group would meet again soon with theater officials.</p>
