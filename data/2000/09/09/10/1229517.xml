        <p>A veil of rain slipped past Arthur Ashe Stadium last night, and as if a curtain had been drawn back, out stepped Venus Williams and Lindsay Davenport in costume and character.</p>
        <p>In an orange sherbet halter dress, Williams wore a sparkling choker and earrings that shimmered in the towering banks of light. In a pale pink ensemble, a less brazen Davenport blended into the spectacle.</p>
        <p>Once their United States Open final began to unfold, the audacity and confidence that now ribbons inside Williams sustained her through the most precarious situations. It was pure defiance. At the moment Williams willfully overcame a 4-1 deficit in the first set, upon the point that gave her a startling 5-4 lead, she strutted off the court for the changeover with her head tilted high.</p>
        <p>It's all in the attitude. One year ago, a dispirited Williams was slumped in the players' box and hidden behind a hood as she watched her sister Serena take the first Grand Slam title in the family at the Open. Last night, Venus Williams was the sister who burst into joy on match point, who happily staggered over to the players' box and celebrated her second Grand Slam victory in a row after her 6-4, 7-5 victory.</p>
        <p>The celebration could not be contained. Once Williams embraced her mother, Oracene, and after she hugged her sister Serena, Richard Williams worked his way down from the seats and into the spotlight he craves. In a bold move, unlike any other parent in memory, Venus Williams's father walked his daughter back onto the court. Then, just a few yards from where a disheartened Davenport was seated on the sideline, he began to shuffle his feet, spin in circles and point to the sky.</p>
        <p>''I always turn my head,'' Davenport said. ''It's better not to see how they act.''</p>
        <p>In July, Richard Williams danced on the roof of a television booth after Venus Williams tucked away Davenport at Wimbledon. This time, there seemed to be even more oomph to the Williams family reaction. Richard Williams -- who left his seat when his daughter appeared on the verge of defeat in her intense semifinal match a day earlier against Martina Hingis -- was sending a message to Davenport.</p>
        <p>Over the past two weeks, Davenport and Hingis, weary of the all-Williams, all-the-time hype, formed an alliance. In the locker room, they tried to motivate each other to break up an all-Williams final. Hingis failed, but Davenport did her part by eliminating Serena Williams in the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>''I think Lindsay and Martina better come to me for advice,'' said Richard Williams, who coaches his daughters. ''Because they're not winning.''</p>
        <p>Davenport beat one Williams in this tournament. But no player has ever beaten both Venus and Serena Williams in a Grand Slam event. Last night, the pattern of Williams family dominance continued. In a way, the discussion about alliances only further steeled Venus Williams for the final.</p>
        <p>After the 6-foot-2-inch Davenport successfully began the match by using a familiar strategy -- crushing the ball into the lengthy wingspan of the 6-1 Williams -- she started to come unglued in her service game. By the end of the first set, Davenport's first-serve percentage had plummeted to 46.</p>
        <p>''I was trying to go for more on the second serve because she obviously returns well and attacks,'' she said. ''I didn't serve nearly as well as I needed to. She was just too good.''</p>
        <p>Davenport helped her shine even more. In the sixth game of the first set, Davenport whacked a double fault. Then she sent in a stream of second serves that allowed Williams to reach back and pummel the lines. On her heels, Davenport could not fight off Williams's power with her own. The same scenario also unfolded in the eighth game of the set.</p>
        <p>''I had been playing the wrong tennis,'' said Williams, who began the night by overhitting her ground strokes and going all out for winners. ''I had to change it up.''</p>
        <p>Once Williams regained a balance in her game -- aggressive on her swinging volleys, but patient during the rallies -- she took over. Slowly, frustration replaced the early confidence Davenport had. She was never the same after holding a 4-1 lead.</p>
        <p>Davenport's footwork turned into tangles, her reactions grew languid, and Williams was able to run off six games in a row before Davenport could regroup. She just could not come through on a big point. In the second set, Davenport converted just 1 of 8 break points; Williams 2 of 7.</p>
        <p>That was all she needed. Soon, Williams had the championship trophy in her hands following her 26th match victory in a row. As the winner, she received a phone call from President Clinton. Not shy in the occasion, she discussed issues with him, including how unhappy she was with the state of her tax bracket.</p>
        <p>Last night, she received another bump in pay. Williams took home a $800,000 winner's check and her second Grand Slam title.</p>
        <p>''I did it at Wimbledon, and I've done it here,'' Williams said. ''I know I can do these things. It's the finals. I was able to keep my game under control.''</p>
        <p>But she had to be patient. Just after the rhythm and blues star Patti LaBelle nearly overwhelmed the speakers with a soulful version of the national anthem, rain began to fall at about 5:25 p.m. Some 90 minutes later, now in prime time, Williams and Davenport were ready to play.</p>
        <p>Williams arrived at the National Tennis Center yesterday as a far different version of the 17-year-old neophyte with the red-white-and-blue beads she wore back in 1997. Back then, she was a gangly, giggly teenager with an aggressive but unpolished game. Still, she stunned everyone on her way to becoming an unseeded finalist. Although she lost to Hingis, she transformed herself from curiosity to a force on the Tour.</p>
        <p>''Oh boy, '97, I was a yearling,'' Williams said. ''I have no regrets in '97 because I just -- I didn't know what I was doing, basically.''</p>
        <p>Last night, she was a competitor. Since July, she has looked and played the part of a champion. She was seeded third in this tournament, but after taking out the top-seeded Hingis and the second-seeded Davenport, it is hard not see Williams as the dominant player in the game.</p>
        <p>''I think I'm a different competitor than what I was in the past,'' she said. ''For me, it didn't matter that I was down 4-1. I was just competing.</p>
        <p>''I've always felt like the best player. I think it's all an attitude, kind of the attitude you take out there toward your game.''</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>LINDSAY DAVENPORT and VENUS WILLIAMS each had the chance to be the first player since MARTINA HINGIS in 1997 to win multiple Grand Slam titles in the same year. This year, Davenport won the Australian Open, and Williams took the Wimbledon championship. . . . Although the last all-American final was in 1984 (MARTINA NAVRATILOVA against CHRIS EVERT-LLOYD), the last time an all-American-born final occurred was 1979, when TRACY AUSTIN defeated Evert.</p>
        <p>There's More Tennis to See</p>
        <p>Today's conclusion of the United States Open is not the end of professional tennis in this area. A women's satellite event will be held this week in Hopewell Junction, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The prize money of the Prudential Serls Women's Challenger of Dutchess County is more modest than the Open -- only $25,000 total. But several players who competed in the Open, including Tara Snyder, are scheduled to play. Snyder lost in the Open's first round to Elena Dementieva. The tourney will be held at the Americana Tennis and Sports Club.</p>
