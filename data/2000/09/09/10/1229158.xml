        <p>LADIES with lacy parasols, twilit mansions with topiary mazes: there's no huge mystery about why filmmakers would be attracted to Henry James novels. Adapting James is a more dignified undertaking than filming ''Lethal Weapon IV''; Henry James shot-puts us into the land of Art, of substance and gravitas. Besides, there are only so many Jane Austen novels.</p>
        <p>We've thus seen, in quick succession, Jane Campion's ''Portrait of a Lady'' (1996), Agnieszka Holland's ''Washington Square'' (1997) and Iain Softley's ''Wings of the Dove'' (1998) -- as if there were an antitrust suit to bust up the Merchant-Ivory monopoly on James, which has produced ''The Europeans'' (1979), ''The Bostonians'' (1984) and, coming on Nov. 3, ''The Golden Bowl.''</p>
        <p>But contrary to the appearance of a mini-boom, filmmakers have in fact been steadily filming James for over a half-century. Since 1947, at least 30 James novels and stories have been brought to big and small screen, mostly to give sundry ''it'' girls a chance to dress up. ''The Heiress,'' William Wyler's 1949 version of ''Washington Square,''  stars Olivia de Havilland, and Peter Bogdanovich bathes Cybill Shepherd in golden light in ''Daisy Miller'' (1974). ''The Innocents'' (1961), based on ''The Turn of the Screw,'' stars Deborah Kerr; John Frankenheimer directed Ingrid Bergman in the same vehicle, for television, in 1959. Ten adaptations of ''The Turn of the Screw'' feature evil children torturing their governesses -- which means, of course, that without Henry James there would be no ''Omen IV: The Awakening.''</p>
        <p>Despite the respectful good will of these efforts, most of the films lose James in the translation. Either they aim for stately -- and become deadly dull. Or they trump the drama with swelling scores and shouting matches more appropriate for a daytime soap. What no filmmaker has yet found is a way to capture James's gently acid tone. The last decade's adjective of the moment, ''edgy,'' might have been invented for the novelist's dark, layered ironies. But to understand his tone, we must understand his culture. Making sense of James's characters requires sharing assumptions about money and manners that simply don't compute for a contemporary audience. The films therefore resort to screaming clues through a megaphone -- and thus sacrifice subtlety in stories that pretty much depend on subtlety.</p>
        <p>They're costume dramas, so let's start with the costumes.</p>
        <p>In ''The Golden Bowl,'' James's novel about a nasty love quadrangle, Maggie sits at home, pretending to read. Really she awaits her husband, who, Maggie suspects, is having an affair with her best friend, Charlotte, who, it so happens, is also her father's wife. But Maggie will not make a scene. She waits quietly, in a brand-new dress. She does not even indulge in the luxury of pacing. Would Charlotte like the dress? Probably not, although the hyper-polite Charlotte would never say so.</p>
        <p>Imagine the challenge of translating this one crucial scene to the screen. In the new film, directed by James Ivory, Maggie forgoes dignity and hurls herself dolefully on the floor in front of the fire. When hubby finally returns, he compliments the frock. ''You like it?'' Maggie says. ''I wore it tonight for dinner -- for you. But you had dined.'' Point taken: she's on to him. But how to reveal Maggie's thoughts about Charlotte without Charlotte's appearing on the scene, without even a word of dialogue?</p>
        <p>That is the almost wholly internal drama of ''The Golden Bowl,'' and it could not be less cinematic. The risk of trying to film such scenes, of course, is that you reduce the novels to fancy-dress balls -- and let's face it, a contemporary audience can barely tell a tasteful gown from a tacky one. Unfortunate, since there's no doubt that James takes the clothes seriously, as does Isabel Archer, the heroine of ''The Portrait of a Lady,'' when she proclaims: ''I've a great respect for things! One's self -- for other people -- is one's expression of one's self; and one's house, one's furniture, one's garments, the books one reads, the company one keeps -- these are all expressive.''</p>
        <p>To make sure we can read the signs of ''Washington Square'' -- James's consideration of gold-digging -- Agnieszka Holland dresses up Jennifer Jason Leigh for the ball so that she looks like an upholstered sofa bought at a yard sale. Plus she can't dance and trips a lot. She's such a hopeless plain Jane that we know her father's right: her suitor can only be after her money. But if that's too obvious, where's the suspense? In the film, what you see is what you get. In the novel, you're not sure what you're seeing or getting; James thus forces readers to reconsider their suppositions about marriage.</p>
        <p>Jane Austen's young women don't have to choose love or money. They generally get both. Not so in James, whose marrying maidens get betrayals, intrigues and disappointments. In a way, ''The Portrait of a Lady'' seems ripe for contemporary retelling. But in updating the characters, Jane Campion loses the story's sense and center.</p>
        <p>Ms. Campion wants to portray Isabel as a feminist free spirit. So while the other damsels at the ball in ''The Portrait of a Lady'' faint, presumably from the corsets, Nicole Kidman struts about with her burnished hair wild and aswirl, utterly indifferent to her clothes, her eyes red-rimmed. Yet Isabel is supposed to be the ultimate social creature, so charming she needs no dowry. If she's going to spend all her time crying or almost crying, oblivious to everyone, why should so many suitors ardently want her?</p>
        <p>Why Isabel chooses Gilbert Osmond (John Malkovich), a bald boor in the slimiest of smoking jackets, is unclear too, although Ms. Campion throws in a little fantasy sequence of a menage a trois to suggest that it has something to do with sexuality. (''Director's Cut: The Playboy Mansion Footage''?) Ms. Campion actually has Osmond strike Isabel, something the King of Decorousness never even comes close to doing in the novel. As a portrait of a marriage, the film is less Henry James than ''The Ike and Tina Story.''</p>
        <p>Not that you can blame directors for wanting to offer us something to watch. In ''Washington Square,'' Ms. Holland has her heroine chase her ex-beau's carriage, in pouring rain, and fall sobbing in the mud. (In the novel, stiff upper lip prevails.) Here, in the book, is how Isabel realizes that her husband and his old friend Serena Merle are, as James would say, ''familiarly associated'': she sees them talking near the fire. But Madame Merle stands while Osmond remains seated. James doesn't need to alert his readers to what such rudeness means in a gentleman: ''The thing made an image, lasting only a moment, like a flicker of light.'' Try that on for size for a film's big Act II reversal. Jane Campion gives up on making the discovery vibrant; she just has someone tell Isabel flat out. But once you excise the psychological unfolding, what do you have? Just another fool for love, with period accents.</p>
        <p>Ismail Merchant and James Ivory don't generally make these kinds of blunders. Say what you will about filmmakers so tasteful they have their own coffee-table book (''Merchant Ivory's English Landscape: Rooms, Views, and Anglo-Saxon Attitudes''), after 45 films they can help an actress wear a bustle without looking like a buffoon. The camera caresses the country estates. You can feel both the seduction of the moneyed life and its concurrent risk of hollowness. Moreover, the filmmakers have feelings about expatriates' belonging and longing, those critical Jamesian themes.</p>
        <p>If you need to see how far Mr. Merchant and Mr. Ivory have advanced the look and feel of the cinematic James, revisit the 1969 BBC production of ''The Portrait of a Lady,'' a studio piece of the old school. The light, the clothes, the wainscoting: everything looks brown. The point of the story is muddy as well. And the blather! It's enough to make you want to hurl yourself face down in the mud. Merchant and Ivory's longtime screenwriter, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, mercifully strips down the dialogue.</p>
        <p>BUT Mr. Merchant and Mr. Ivory may be growing tired of the ''tasteful'' label. No more English reserve for them; ''The Golden Bowl'' goes all Italian, rococo and operatic. More sweeping vistas, more gilded interiors, a drunken bacchanal reminiscent of a Victorian ''Animal House,'' molto sobbing, even (duck!) that bonus passionate smack to the face. Surprising, since this is the quietest of James's novels -- a book about secrecy and decoding in which hardly anyone says anything to anyone about anything. But perhaps for that very reason, the script shifts the focus from the cuckolded parties to the adulterers. (At least they're doing something.)</p>
        <p>To help us see the dangers of wealth, Maggie's father, the American millionaire Adam Verver (Nick Nolte), is made not a homebody but Citizen Kane-ish in his isolation, hoarding his goodies while his young bride (Uma Thurman) plays solitaire in the drafty mansion. (In today's movies, being able to afford a governess, much less a wing of an estate for her, makes a character highly suspect and ripe for satanic takeover. But James liked money. Maybe we have to wait for the ''Clueless''-style update, in which Adam Verver is an Internet billionaire building a pleasure palace in Seattle, to understand that.)</p>
        <p>To Mr. Ivory's credit, it's a briskly paced two-hour film. You'd need a six-part mini-series to be true to the novel. Actually, there is a six-part mini-series of ''The Golden Bowl'' (BBC, 1972). Made before the ''Brideshead Revisited'' revolution in British television, it's long-winded, the casting off. Still, a mini-series could allow you to dwell on each unnerving revelation, and to do tight reaction shots without looking pretentious. Time to crack out Michael Gambon, Jeremy Irons, Helen Mirren, Ian Holm, the entire cast of ''Pride and Prejudice.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, many of the actors and actresses do get recycled from one period film and television show to another. Kate Beckinsale, from the A &amp; E ''Emma,'' appears as Maggie in ''The Golden Bowl''; her husband, Amerigo, is Jeremy Northam, who plays Emma's suitor Knightley in the feature film version of ''Emma.'' Not that these actors aren't capable, but it does triple the ''Wait, didn't I already see this period movie?'' double take.</p>
        <p>James gives actors eerily little to do. Actors must be expressive with the least possible wailing or ground-pounding -- often through nothing more than a hesitation or a veiled glance. They can't just hammer on one note, either. Each performance must be deep and protean. Because the vehicles are by necessity so quiet, with James the directing is paramount. The director must provide a controlling voice and make sense of all the conflicting clues.</p>
        <p>To date, the film that best manages such Jamesian complexity is Iain Softley's ''Wings of the Dove.'' The costume-drama queen Helena Bonham Carter, her bare shoulders aglow against Venetian stucco, wears gowns of sapphire blue so rich you understand why she would sell her soul in order to be able to afford them. Mr. Softley generally admits only one color per scene -- a bright red taxi, that deep and luscious blue -- while the rest of the world recedes into gritty gray. Each frame of this film is so visually charged that you could watch it without the sound and still be bombarded by signals of posture, personality, reaction, interaction. Mr. Softley updates the novel from 1902 to 1910, a period of social transition and uncertainty. It's not James's period, but at least it's a period.</p>
        <p>It doesn't hurt that Linus Roache is as beautiful to look at as the very different women (one worldly, one virginal) vying for his attention. And he's new. When the American heiress spies Mr. Roache's character for the first time from a balcony, hers is not the only breath taken away. Glamorous and brooding, alternately shy and sly, he's the perfect Jamesian boy-toy.The movie's climactic nude scene captures the bleakness of the novel, in which the characters ''attempted to bury in the dark blindness of each other's arms the knowledge of each other that they couldn't undo.''</p>
        <p>While ''The Wings of the Dove'' may be the most menacing James novel, even it is often quite funny. We're still waiting for a James movie with a sense of humor. ''I, Claudius,''  ''The Young Catherine'': once more, it's television, as opposed to film, that seems to have managed a way to season period gravity with irony. (Hot tip to development folk: still awaiting adaptation is James's seriocomic gem ''What Maisie Knew,'' a child's-eye view of an ugly divorce.)</p>
        <p>One final plea to James adaptors of the future. Please lose the madcap accents. Being an American abroad does not require you to speak like Scarlett O'Hara. Nor do you need to speak really, really loudly, as Kathy Bates does in ''Titanic,'' to show how crass you are. In ''The Golden Bowl,'' both Anjelica Huston and Nick Nolte sport intermittent Texas or Carolina twangs. Only the English actress Kate Beckinsale manages an appropriate American accent.</p>
        <p>But then, this is why we like English actors in our period pieces. They can do accents because they mostly understand the notion of class, and Americans mostly don't. Which is why James didn't deign to live on our shores -- and why translating his byzantine class consciousness into film terms is close to impossible.</p>
