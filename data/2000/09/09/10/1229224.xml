        <p>CAN nitrous oxide  sometimes called laughing gas -- help a person stop smoking?</p>
        <p>Can a nutritional supplement keep one awake and alert after missing a night's sleep?</p>
        <p>These are among the questions researchers are trying to answer at New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Westchester division, here.</p>
        <p>At any given time on the campus of the venerable psychiatric institution, dozens of studies are being conducted. Researchers place advertisements in local newspapers and penny-savers to find participants, who receive fees and/or free treatment.</p>
        <p>Currently, smokers are among those in demand. Dr. Carlo Bayrakdarian, attending psychiatrist at the hospital and instructor at the college, is investigating the effects of nitrous oxide on smokers who have just quit and are fighting severe cravings to light up again. Also involved are his wife, Dr. Aurora Dogaru, who is also a psychiatrist; Dr. Judy Weingram, an anesthesiologist; and Linton Dorfman, a registered nurse.</p>
        <p>Several years ago, Dr. Bayrakdarian learned of a study in South Africa in which nitrous oxide helped alcoholics in the early stages of detoxification.</p>
        <p>''I was looking for something that would help smokers during those very first days of nicotine withdrawal,'' he said, adding that the nitrous oxide gas is administered in a single session by face mask for about half an hour without ill effect except a possible temporary lowering of inhibitions. The procedure should precede nicotine patches, nicotine gum, antidepressants or smoking cessation programs, which are used during long-term rehabilitation.</p>
        <p>The addictive component in cigarettes, he explained, is the nicotine, which affects naturally occurring mood-altering brain chemicals like serotonin, dopamine and the opioids, or endorphins. Although the mechanism is not fully understood, the bottom line is that inhaling smoke makes the user feel good, at least for the moment.</p>
        <p>Nitrous oxide, sometimes used during dental procedures, affects the opioids. In larger doses, it is an anesthesia; in smaller doses, it is an analgesic, or painkiller. During application of the gas, the patient feels little or no pain and usually experiences a mild high.</p>
        <p>Last year Dr. Bayrakdarian conducted a study with seven subjects. ''We had such good results I almost thought it couldn't be true,'' he said. After getting nitrous oxide, three smokers greatly reduced their smoking, and four stopped altogether.</p>
        <p>Now Dr. Bayrakdarian is starting a larger study. In hopes of analyzing the effects of nitrous oxide on 50 or more smokers, he is advertising in local publications, seeking healthy smokers, 22 and older, who have tried but failed to kick the habit. Only one session is needed, and the treatment is free. Those interested should call (914) 997-4332.</p>
        <p>''Nitrous oxide seems to work in some way,'' he said. ''This is very exciting. Why does it work? That is still the million-dollar question.''</p>
        <p>Participants in an unrelated study will be paid $400. That study is an inquiry into whether a commercially sold product, ENADAlert, can increase alertness after someone has been deprived of a night's sleep. ENADAlert's main component is NADH, a substance that occurs naturally in body cells and is said to enhance the immune system and increase cognitive function and energy.</p>
        <p>Dr. Margaret Moline, director of the hospital's sleep-wake disorders center, and Dr. James Rebeta, co-director of the neuropsychological testing service, are conducting the study, which is financed by Menuco of Manhattan, the maker of ENADAlert.</p>
        <p>Subjects will go through a screening to provide information about themselves and then they will undergo a preliminary testing, which will entail problem solving at a computer.</p>
        <p>Then they will twice stay overnight in the sleep-wake center a couple of weeks apart. In private rooms equipped with large beds, private bathrooms and television sets, they will be kept awake all night. In the morning, some will be given ENADAlert, others a placebo. Then they will eat breakfast.</p>
        <p>Next, they will sit in front of a computer screen and try to solve hypothetical problems that require reasoning ability, spatial skills and the like. Brain-wave activity and response time will be monitored, and the participants will also be asked to describe their subjective feelings of alertness or fatigue. Those wanting to participate should call (914) 682-9100, extension 2312.</p>
        <p>The study, Dr. Moline said, will be especially valuable in determining whether or not NADH can help shift workers -- nurses, police officers -- and professionals like airline pilots for whom lack of sleep can be deadly.</p>
        <p>''There are situations where sleep deprivation is unavoidable,'' she said, explaining that people tend to rely on caffeine, which has its own drawbacks. ''It is important to see if there is something that can help. Not everyone is able to get a good night's sleep all of the time.''</p>
