        <p>Fiddle and Folk</p>
        <p>Today, for the 16th year in a row, the Museums at Stony Brook will be the host for the Long Island Fiddle and Folk Festival. Garnet Rogers, a Canadian singer and songwriter, will be the headliner of the event, which also includes the Stony Brook Taiko Ensemble, a Japanese drumming group; Mindy Jostyn, a fiddler; Gallowglass, a traditional Irish trio; Buddy Merriam with Blue Midnight, a bluegrass group; and Calanish, a Celtic duo. Hours are noon to 5 p.m. on the grounds of the museum complex on Route 25A. Nonperishable foods and personal-care items for the Maryhaven Food Bank will be collected. (631) 751-0066, ext. 214.</p>
        <p>Nautical Festivals</p>
        <p>When they take place on the waterfront, chances are that fairs and festivals will have a nautical theme. And these two-day events, on Saturday and next Sunday, won't disappoint. At Hempstead's Lido Beach Town Park, the 20th annual Festival by the Sea, from 11 a.m. to dusk on Saturday, will feature surf-casting and sand sculpture contests, a biathlon, food and crafts sales, live concerts and for children, a petting zoo, trout fishing pond, puppet shows and games. (516) 292-9000, ext. 382. In West Islip, Captree State Park will hold its 17th annual Captree Carnival from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., with crab races, live entertainment, pony rides, magic shows and seafood specialties to sample. (631) 669-0449.</p>
        <p>A Tribute With a Twist</p>
        <p>Having ended its summer of plays, the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor will turn its attention to a series of weekly events, which will begin Saturday at 7 p.m. with ''Simply Barbra,'' Steven Brinberg's loving tribute to (and wicked send-up of) that diva of all divas, Barbra Streisand. And before the theater takes its winter hiatus, there will be appearances by the Eroica Trio on Sept. 17; Bill Stritch, Sept. 23; a ''KidStreet'' series for children, Sept. 24, Oct. 1 and 8; Judy Carmichael and Steve Ross, Oct. 7; Claiborne Cary, Oct. 14; play readings, Oct. 21 and 22; and the Miro String Quartet, Oct. 22. (631) 725-9500.</p>
        <p>Play Ball</p>
        <p>Just in time for the World Series,  the Smithtown Township Arts Council is taking an unusual look at the  All-American game. Artists from throughout the United States have contributed oils, sculptures, photographs, drawings, collages, pastels and mixed-media works to ''The Art of Baseball,'' an exhibition that opens Saturday and runs through Oct. 15 at the Mills Pond House on Route 25A in St. James. An opening-day reception at 2 p.m. will feature the Huntington Suffolks Old Tyme Base Ball Team in a performance of ''Bloom and O'Hara: An Old Tyme Base Ball Play'' and the Workin' Class Barbershop Quartet in a medley of historic songs. (631) 862-6575.</p>
        <p>Baseball fans might also want to check out ''Baseball: Yesterday and Today,'' Robert L. Harrison's photographic essay that shows how the game has been played on Long Island over the last 150 years. The exhibition runs through September at the East Meadow Library on Front Street. (516) 794-2570.</p>
        <p>Cleanup Time</p>
        <p>With summer almost over, it's time to pay the piper. And the 14th annual New York State Beach Cleanup, part of the International Coastal Cleanup, will be Saturday at beaches throughout the Island. The American Littoral Society has a phone number for volunteers, (800) 449-0790, but for specific local activities call the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation's Long Island Region at (631) 669-1000, ext. 247, or sites like Gardiner County Park in West Bay Shore at (631) 581-6908, or Garvies Point Preserve in Glen Cove at (516) 571-8010.</p>
        <p>Living History</p>
        <p>Those who like to see their history made real -- well, relatively real -- have two chances to time-travel this week. On the Great Lawn of the Sands Point Preserve off Middle Neck Road, a Medieval Festival, complete with battling knights, damsels in distress, Renaissance music, crafts and games, and even the  storming of a castle, will take place from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and next Sunday and again on Sept. 23 and 24. (516) 571-7900.</p>
        <p>In Montauk the history will be a bit more current: 1898, in fact. The United Spanish-American War Society and re-enactors from across the country will pay tribute to Suffolk County's role in that war with a military encampment, mock battles and, of course, Gov. Theodore Roosevelt of New York. Hours are 1 to 4 p.m. Saturday and 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. next Sunday at Theodore Roosevelt County Park. (516) 852-7878.</p>
        <p>B. B. King's 75th</p>
        <p>It's B. B. King's 75th birthday, which, of course, calls for celebration. And celebrate they will on Saturday at Jones Beach State Park, when the B. B. King Blues Festival 2000 is scheduled. Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi and Corey Harris join Mr. King in concert at 6:30 p.m. at the Jones Beach Theater. Fireworks by Grucci will follow the concert, the season's finale at the beach. (516) 221-1000.</p>
        <p>'Tap Dancing Stories'</p>
        <p>Brenda Bufalino, a dancer, choreographer, author and composer, will tell her ''Tap Dancing Stories''  at 8 p.m. Friday at the Brush Barn on Route 25 in Smithtown. Among the tales she will tell are ''Tapping Mingus,'' which celebrates the music of Charles Mingus, and ''The Too Tall Too Small Blues,'' a poetic song-and-dance tribute to her mentor, Honi Coles. (631) 689-3285.</p>
        <p>Taking Stock</p>
        <p>Two programs this week may help participants separate the wheat from the chaff. Today, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the St. James General Store on Moriches Road, Jerry Kramer, a Smithtown coin dealer, will lecture and give free appraisals (limit: 15 coins per person). (631) 862-8333.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, a two-day Appraisal Weekend opens at Rock Hall Museum on Broadway in Lawrence. At 8 p.m. Saturday, Carol Prisant, the author of ''The Antiques Roadshow Primer,'' will give a free talk. Reservations: (516) 239-1157. On Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m., appraisers from the Phillips International Auctioneers will provide verbal evaluations of heirlooms and treasures. A donation of $10 per item is requested; limit:  three pieces per person.</p>
        <p>Free Choices</p>
        <p>TODAY-- Daniel Berman, piano, opens a series of six classical music concerts at the Freeport Library on South Ocean Avenue at 2:30 p.m. (516) 379-3274.</p>
        <p>TUESDAY -- WCWP-FM (88.1), the radio station on the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University in Brookville, will offer three hours of live acoustic music that will touch all pop bases, from rock to folk and back again. The concert will begin at 5 p.m. in the Residence Quad. (516) 299-2683.</p>
        <p>WEDNESDAY -- Learn about ''Poisonous Plants Around the Yard and Garden'' at a meeting of the Bayard Cutting Arboretum Horticultural Society at 8 p.m. in the arboretum's Carriage House in Oakdale. (631) 581-1002.</p>
        <p>SATURDAY -- Dance Visions, a company that preserves the works of modern dance pioneers, will perform ''The Divine Flame,'' a dance theater piece about the life, times, inspiration and work of Isadora Duncan, at 8 p.m. at the Plainview-Old Bethpage Library on Old Country Road in Plainview. (516) 938-0077.</p>
        <p>Youngsters under 14 can compete in the Third Annual Children's Snapper Roundup from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at Hempstead Harbor Beach Park in Port Washington. Advance registration: (516) 679-7120.</p>
