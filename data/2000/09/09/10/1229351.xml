        <p>THERE is no question that exchange-traded funds are a hot investment. Their assets have nearly doubled this year, to $52.6 billion; so has the number of the offerings, which now exceeds 60, according to Strategic Insight, a fund consulting firm in New York.</p>
        <p>But are these funds good for investors? ''They're cheap to manage, tax-efficient and easy to get in and out of,'' said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago. ''I can't believe that they won't become a popular product worldwide.''</p>
        <p>Exchange-traded funds are groups of stocks that generally track popular market indexes. The first were Standard &amp; Poor's Depository Receipts, known as Spiders, which were  created in 1993 by the American Stock Exchange, where the exchange-traded funds still trade.</p>
        <p>Like stocks, exchange-traded funds can be bought or sold all day long, bought on margin and sold short. In contrast, most mutual funds are priced only once a day.</p>
        <p>Investors who place limit orders, buying or selling at specified prices to take advantage of intraday price fluctuations, may get better prices in exchange-traded funds, said Albert J. Fredman, professor of finance at California State University in Fullerton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Markese said investors ''might see a lot of index-based mutual funds moving over into E.T.F. form,'' adding, ''I don't think many companies will be able to compete without doing that.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Vanguard Group, the nation's biggest manager of index mutual funds, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to add exchange-traded versions of five of its index mutual funds.</p>
        <p>Managers' costs for exchange-traded funds are lower than for index mutual funds, which provide services like telephone operations and,  sometimes, branch offices.</p>
        <p>The Vanguard 500 Index, the best-known index mutual fund, charges 0.18 percent of assets a year -- razor-thin by mutual fund standards, but almost double the 0.095 percent for Barclays Global Investors iShares Trust, an exchange-traded fund that also tracks the S.&amp; P. 500. (Exchange funds based on narrow market segments or foreign exchanges can have expenses as high as 1.5 percent.)</p>
        <p>But exchange-traded funds have another cost: Because they are traded like stocks, investors must pay brokerage commissions. Professor Fredman recommended using low-cost online brokers, not full-service brokers, to execute trades. ''You don't need much advice when you buy E.T.F.'s,'' he said, ''because you don't need to evaluate the stocks or the managers.''</p>
        <p>Because of the brokerage costs, Mr. Fredman added, an exchange-traded fund makes more sense for someone who wants to invest a large sum at one time, instead of making smaller purchases on a regular basis, as many fund investors do.</p>
        <p>Long-term investors who reinvest dividends might be better off in index mutual funds. Dividends in exchange-traded funds can be reinvested only if a broker offers the service, and then only for full shares; sometimes a fee is assessed. Mutual funds, by contrast, allow dividends to be reinvested in fractional shares, and the service is generally free.</p>
        <p>Another advantage of exchange  funds is tax efficiency. Mutual funds may have to sell shares to meet investor redemptions, creating taxable gains typically distributed to investors at year-end. Because exchange funds are traded in-kind by market specialists, shares need not be sold to meet redemptions.</p>
        <p>The more convenient trading of exchange funds can cut both ways, Professor Fredman cautioned. ''Because it's so easy to jump in and out,'' he said, ''people may be tempted to day-trade, and that can be self-destructive.'' But exchange funds could help index mutual funds by luring away market timers, thus reducing costs for the index funds' long-term investors, he added.</p>
        <p>Closed-end funds, which are also pools of securities that trade throughout the day, are actively managed and often sell for sharp discounts or occasionally at premiums to the value of their underlying assets. By contrast, exchange-traded funds, which generally track indexes, are priced efficiently and are more tax efficient.</p>
