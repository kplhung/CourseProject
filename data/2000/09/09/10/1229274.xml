        <p>FORT WASHINGTON  'Little Red'In Words and Music</p>
        <p>The children's book ''The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge'' is based on a true story, and its real-life inspiration will be celebrated on Saturday. A reading of the book, written by Hildegarde H. Swift, will culminate the Little Red Lighthouse Festival in Fort Washington Park. ''Little Red'' was erected in Sandy Hook, N.J., in 1880, and was moved to its present location in 1921. When the lighthouse escaped destruction in 1951, it became property of the Parks Department, which is a host of the festival.</p>
        <p>Events will include tours of the lighthouse, hay rides, craft activities for children and exhibits by nautical and conservationist organizations. There will also be musical performances by the Latin Jazz Alliance, Freddie Hartington's Steel Drum Band and Jerry Joy Music Alliance.  Fire Department boats will spray rainbows of water into the air above swimmers participating in the Little Red Lighthouse swim.</p>
