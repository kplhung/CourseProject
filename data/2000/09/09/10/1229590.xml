        <p>Caution: Men in Trees</p>
        <p>Stories.</p>
        <p>By Darrell Spencer.</p>
        <p>University of Georgia , $24.95.</p>
        <p>This collection of nine short stories, populated by damaged, violent, loopy characters, might more accurately be called ''Caution: Men Who Fell Out of Trees.'' In one story, a Mormon woman tries to help an ailing neighbor by telling him she has placed his injured hamstring in her temple for healing. In another, a telephone repairman is so angered by a closed road that he straps on his pole-climbing spurs, threatens the road crew, ''smashes the barricade's blinking light'' and ''grinds it to pieces under his boot heel.'' Then there is the story that features Armstrong Otto, an ever-prepared vampire hunter who carries a box of salt, incense and a wooden stake in a brown grocery bag. Darrell Spencer's frazzled characters never become caricatures, however -- they each seem vividly rooted in their predicaments. This book won the Flannery O'Connor Award for short fiction, and its main fault is that it is perhaps too literary, filled with self-consciously dazzling sentences. In some of these stories, less would have been more.</p>
