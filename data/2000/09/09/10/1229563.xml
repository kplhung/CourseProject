        <p>OF REBECCA WEST</p>
        <p>Edited by Bonnie Kime Scott.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 497 pp. New Haven:</p>

        <p>Who was the most fearless writer, male or female, of the century we have just left behind? In any such contest, Dame Rebecca West would have to rank high on the short list. An uncompromising literary critic, she slammed Tolstoy and called T. S. Eliot a fake when the rest of the world was declaring him immortal. With each new effort as a novelist she appeared to zigzag off in a different direction, pooh-poohing the modernist cult of hard, enigmatic genius and running the risk, with influential reviewers, of seeming never to find her voice. Her trips through strife-ridden Yugoslavia in the 1930's resulted in a baggy masterpiece, ''Black Lamb and Grey Falcon,'' which remains a gold standard for literary reporting even if its odder idiosyncrasies could never (and probably should never) be imitated. And then there were the public and private flare-ups that darkened her later career. To her lifelong annoyance, West found notoriety early on as the mother of an out-of-wedlock son by H. G. Wells; when the son grew up, he turned out novels and memoirs portraying her, with what ratio of justification and pettiness we will never really know, as a harridan.</p>
        <p>But West persevered, and through all her adventures it is hard to find a single moment when she ever backed away from something she had done or written. So it is startling, roughly a third of the way through this majestic volume of her letters, to come upon this declaration: ''I am going to live so far as possible utterly and absolutely alone from now on,'' she confided in 1927 to her friend Fannie Hurst, the great soap-opera novelist, ''because simply and straightly I believe that if I don't I am going to get killed.'' The immediate cause of West's distress is hinted at but hard to make out. Apparently a former lover has insulted her, or made a bold sexual request that she found crude and threatening. What matters here is not the provocation so much as the lost-sounding paranoia of West's response. It's the starkest statement of a tendency that hums more quietly through all seven decades of West's correspondence with family, enemies and friends. It seems that this fiercest of literary lionesses lived a good deal of her life in a state of private dread.</p>
        <p>West had a fraught childhood -- of course -- but beyond that the source of her gifts, and her unique constellation of tics and phobias, is difficult to trace. She was born Cicely Isabel Fairfield, the youngest child of a musical mother whose gifts were thwarted by marriage and a charismatic but deadbeat father -- a journalist, who deserted the family with unrealistic dreams of making his fortune in Sierra Leone, and died when she was 14. As Bonnie Kime Scott, the University of Delaware professor of English who edited ''Selected Letters of Rebecca West,'' notes, the earliest entry in the collection of letters West deposited at Yale dates from the period immediately following his demise. A defense of woman suffrage published in The Scotsman and argued with a district attorney's flair, it conveys, instead of the grief she must have felt, the gregarious and slightly overconfident charm of a prodigy.</p>
        <p>It took West a few years to grow into anything like her full promise, but her distinctive humor, which achieved a kind of ultimate mercy by sparing no target, fell into place early on. Thanking Ford Madox Ford for a dinner party (at 20, she was already contributing to his English Review), she dwells on the dullness of a sister guest: ''Perhaps it is an effect of the Puritanism of women. Most men have so much more to repent that they must be amusing to justify their existence.'' Soon after this she met Wells in an encounter that thrilled her, at the time, but hinted at future grounds for annoyance. ''I found him one of the most interesting men I have ever met. He talked straight on from 1:15 till 6:30.'' Alas, the letters to Wells, often written in a coded baby talk, do not quite usher us into the heart of their affair. ''Life is not smoove,'' she complains at one point, exhausted from shepherding a young Emma Goldman through a round of meetings with London intellectuals and Labor leaders. ''I hope Jaguar is finding it smoova.'' Then again, maybe mutual babying, too much time spent apart, West's nerves shot from working on politics and lectures and essays while raising a young son with no help from the stingy, married Wells -- maybe all this was the heart of the affair.</p>
        <p>In any case, West is the rare writer whose correspondence grows more compelling once she leaves behind those crucial formative years. She broke with Wells in 1923, embarking on a lecture tour of the United States. You could carve a slim but brilliant travelogue out of her letters from this point on. Whether putting down strait-laced clubwomen or talking up the scenery along the Susquehanna River, she is sympathetic but ruthlessly unsentimental; she never stoops to snobbery, and she doesn't seduce herself with grandiose theories, like so many of our visitors. Thirteen years later, comfortably but not passionately married to a gentle, childlike man, West went off to lecture in Yugoslavia and sent back lavish, energized accounts that read like short rough drafts of her greatest work. As in her books, the sentences here are often long, powerful and a little hard to follow; shrewd analysis frames eagle-eyed descriptions peppered with wry anecdotes underpinned by startlingly emphatic assertions about human nature, all wrapped in a unique grammar -- namely, a shortage of commas. The result sometimes rivals Proust or the later Henry James in its complexity, except that where Proust and James are polished to perfection West seems fast and raw. The breathtaking richness (and occasional frustration) of her prose has to do with its feeling tossed off, without much care but with an almost Elizabethan vigor.</p>
        <p>Gossip requires that we touch briefly on the two of the more famous dust-ups in West's life: her battles with her son, and her quarrel in the 1950's with liberals like Arthur Schlesinger, who feared her defense of inquiries into American Communism might lend strength to Joseph McCarthy. Neither episode shows West in her best light. In both cases, she spells out with unimpeachable logic why she did what she did, and declares herself mystified when her good intentions are misunderstood. She often persuades. (One can't help believing, for instance, that Anthony West is unfair to accuse his mother of regularly denying him money out of jealousy over Wells -- it just doesn't ring true.) But emotionally, she misses the point. Her miraculous prose flattens to whining argument; the natural comedienne who said that Mary McCarthy had a ''behind built on the lines of a canal barge'' suddenly writes like a tin-eared straight man.</p>
        <p>And here it must be admitted: West seems never to have looked for, or won, much in the way of self-knowledge. In 1927 she started seeing a psychoanalyst, and for a brief period her treatment became so intense -- no less than four and as much as ten hours per day, for days on end, with the analyst coming to live for a while in West's house -- that it seems more like a comedy sketch than something that actually happened. West's own take on the results is itself so perfunctory it could pass for a punch line: ''Now I feel immensely better. It was a terribly intricate and complex business, based on an inconceivably disguised . . . father fixation.'' In the end, she seems to have devised two crudely effective strategies to cope with the threat of unhappiness. First, she accused those close to her, especially a once beloved sister, of wishing her harm. Second, she succumbed to periodic illnesses that may have been her paradoxical way of hanging on to health -- a symbolic purge of the emotional toxins in her life, and the only plausible scenario in which this indomitable woman could appear helpless. Germs and viruses are recurring characters in these letters, acting like conspirators sent to hunt West down; the only thing more striking than the frequency of her bouts with strep throat, hemorrhages, an ''obscure vascular ailment,'' colitis, bronchitis and a vast array of other ''itises'' is the fact that she keeps recovering, going on to explore South African mines in her 60's and Mayan ruins in her 70's and living to a grand old dotage. She died in 1983, at 90, one of the last of her generation to go.</p>
        <p>We tend to imagine our more neurotic geniuses in the romantic mold. Whether shy and fragile or egomaniacal monsters, they're dreamers, with access to visions on a higher plane, and little patience for the shabby, banal facts of ''real life.'' Rebecca West, as always, marked out her own independent path. Her fantasies were never as vivid or convincing as her assessment of what went on before her eyes; her best work was a flight into, not away from, the solid ground of facts. She noticed things, and made resourceful use of every observation, like a cook turning scraps from dinner into broth for tomorrow's stew. And she found significance in details other writers might condescendingly dismiss as trivial. It says much about this woman, who publicly fell out with her son and endured a sexless marriage for nearly two decades, whose fiction never won anything like the renown she hoped for, and whose cherished Yugoslavia lurched farther away each year from stable democracy -- it says much about this woman that she regarded as one of the more offensive blights on her life the shift in women's fashions of the 1920's. The specific object of loathing was Chanel's ''skinny and shapeless'' new box-shaped dress, which ''looked bad if one was made like a choirboy, and worse if one was not!''</p>
        <p>West's point here sounds shallow or reactionary, but in fact it is original and deep. Chanel's dress blurred the difference between the sexes. In West's mind it stood for an aversion to reality, an embrace of high-concept style over real beauty, that began to afflict the arts around the time she came of age. Eliot chased after pretty, empty mysteries in his poetry, she believed, out of ambition more than love of literature; and she deliciously accuses the priggish, self-appointed arbiter of English letters, the Cambridge don F. R. Leavis, of ''using fastidiousness like a nouveau riche who buys asparagus tongs for eating asparagus.''</p>
        <p>On the whole, these letters back up West's complaint that her literary reputation never quite rose to the level she deserved. Perhaps this is because her truth-telling drive and her theatrical personality demand our attention first, and her artistry second: at her strongest, she seems a near prophet who happened to write lively, occasionally awe-inspiring prose. Even she regarded her best work as a form of unconscious prediction. What other impulse, she asks Alexander Woollcott in the early years of World War II, could have drawn her to godforsaken Yugoslavia back in 1936? Why would she be moved ''to devote the following five years of my life, at great financial sacrifice and to the utter exhaustion of my mind and body, to take an inventory of a country down to its last vest-button, in a form insane from any ordinary artistic or commercial point of view -- a country which ceases to exist?'' There, in a nutshell, is the high, low and in-between of Rebecca West. Lucidity coupled with a penchant for exaggeration. Self-pity and bravery. Quixotic devotion to facts, delight in her own absurdity and a rare humility before history. West may not rank among the truly great writers. But she does do this: she fits the usual definitions of greatness so uncomfortably, it makes you wonder if they need to be revised.</p>
