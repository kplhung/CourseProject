        <p>The word ''bizarre'' has been applied to Las Vegas more than once. Now ''bazaar'' has entered the local lexicon, too, with the opening last month of Desert Passage, a shopping mall with a Middle Eastern theme.</p>
        <p>Actually, it's a ''shopping adventure,'' rather than a ''shopping mall,'' if one is to believe the promoters of the 500,000-square-foot retail center, which is connected to the Aladdin Resort and Casino, across Las Vegas Boulevard from Bellagio. How adventuresome most shoppers will feel as they walk by such mall regulars as Ann Taylor, Clinique and Hugo Boss is anybody's guess. Then again, there's probably a limited market for figs, dates and exotic spices in Las Vegas.</p>

        <p>The word ''bizarre'' has been applied to Las Vegas more than once. Now ''bazaar'' has entered the local lexicon, too, with the opening last month of Desert Passage, a shopping mall with a Middle Eastern theme.</p>
        <p>Actually, it's a ''shopping adventure,'' rather than a ''shopping mall,'' if one is to believe the promoters of the 500,000-square-foot retail center, which is connected to the Aladdin Resort and Casino, across Las Vegas Boulevard from Bellagio. How adventuresome most shoppers will feel as they walk by such mall regulars as Ann Taylor, Clinique and Hugo Boss is anybody's guess. Then again, there's probably a limited market for figs, dates and exotic spices in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Desert Passage, much like the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, is designed to apply the theme-park touch to spending and getting. The 130 stores and 14 restaurants are set amid Moorish archways, authentic antiques and other Moroccan decor, all of it aimed at making shoppers think they are strolling in the markets of Tangier, Fez and Marrakesh. A 115-foot freighter is ''docked'' inside the building, and there is an eight-story re-creation of a hillside village.</p>
        <p>The stores are open daily from 10 a.m. to midnight, although the restaurants and nightclubs will operate later. Even when all the businesses are closed, Desert Passage will remain open for visitors to walk through.</p>
        <p>As with any good casbah, the pace barely slows at night. The restaurants in Desert Passage will include branches of Commander's Palace, the New Orleans restaurant; Bice, from Milan; and Anasazi, from Santa Fe. The Blue Note Jazz Club, a haunt of Manhattan jazz aficionados, also has a branch there.</p>
        <p>But even though there is a rug merchant, Desert Passage will never pass for an authentic souk for at least one reason: no tourist touts.</p>
