        <p>ROBERT KENNEDY</p>
        <p>His Life.</p>
        <p>By Evan Thomas.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 509 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster. $28.</p>
        <p>''By 1967,'' Evan Thomas observes in ''Robert Kennedy: His Life,'' ''the legends were already half written. To his worshipers in the New York literati, he was a romantic antihero. . . . To liberals like Arthur Schlesinger, he was a voice of enlightenment who could save the Democratic Party from the madness of Lyndon Johnson. To Kennedy's loyal staff back in Washington, he was an irascible, moody boss who could save the whole world if he didn't spend too much time hanging around celebrities. . . . They expected Kennedy to be a philosopher king.'' The assassination of the second Kennedy, during the Democratic presidential primary campaign in 1968, ensured the triumph of the myth, which in recent years has provoked a revisionist backlash by polemicists like Seymour Hersh and scholars like Ronald Steel.</p>
        <p>''Robert Kennedy: His Life'' is a fresh look at Robert F. Kennedy by a biographer who was not a family friend, a nostalgic veteran of the New Left or a self-righteous debunker. Evan Thomas, the assistant managing editor of Newsweek in Washington, is the co-author, with Walter Isaacson, of ''The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made,'' and he has also written books about the Central Intelligence Agency and the prominent Washington lawyer Edward Bennett Williams. Thomas says he may be the first scholar to have been granted access to the closed R.F.K. papers at the Kennedy Library since Arthur Schlesinger Jr. published his biography in 1978. The labor of scholars studying the Soviet bloc has provided new information about cold war episodes, like the Cuban missile crisis, in which Thomas's subject played a major part. A definitive biography will be impossible as long as the Kennedy family refuses to make all the papers public. Meanwhile, this judicious and thorough book is likely to be the most comprehensive and balanced study of the life and career of Robert F. Kennedy for a long time to come.</p>
        <p>Thomas has little to add to the familiar story of the brother who loyally, and sometimes viciously, protected the interests of President John F. Kennedy as attorney general, sank into despair after his brother's murder by Lee Harvey Oswald and was pressured by allies and admirers into carrying on the family tradition, first as a United States Senator from New York and then as a candidate for the presidency in 1968. The story of the nasty, escalating feud between Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson is familiar as well. The challenge of a biographer of either Robert or John Kennedy is to sort out fact from fiction in areas in which, for obvious reasons, the facts are not readily available: their sex lives, their alleged relationship with the Mafia and covert operations, particularly the campaign to depose Cuba's Communist dictator, Fidel Castro. On the basis of a careful sifting of the evidence and his own impressive knowledge of the milieu of the Kennedy brothers, Thomas reaches conclusions on various controversial topics: Robert Kennedy did not have an affair with Marilyn Monroe; he knew about, if he did not order, C.I.A.-Mafia plots against Castro.</p>
        <p>Despite his measured approach, or rather because of it, Thomas, who is clearly sympathetic to Robert Kennedy, demolishes the myth of Bobby the liberal icon far more effectively than any exercise in debunking has done. While giving him credit for supporting the civil rights movement in key crises as attorney general, for denouncing apartheid during a 1966 trip to South Africa and for taking a sincere interest in poverty in the late 1960's, Thomas notes that Kennedy authorized J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. director, to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr. ''to find out if he was under the influence of the Kremlin.'' The ''prudish and homophobic'' Kennedy shared Hoover's gossip about the homosexuality of Bayard Rustin, the organizer of the March on Washington, with his brother the president. ''At a Georgetown dinner party on the eve of the March on Washington, R.F.K. said to Marietta Tree, the U.S. delegate to the United Nations and a prominent society figure, 'So you're down here for that old black fairy's anti-Kennedy demonstration?' Mrs. Tree tried to change the subject to Dr. King. According to Mrs. Tree, Kennedy said: 'He's not a serious person. If the country knew what we know about King's goings-on, he'd be finished.' ''In the 1968 Democratic primary campaign, during a televised debate with Eugene McCarthy, Thomas writes, ''Kennedy got off one cheap shot: When McCarthy suggested that the ghettoes needed to be 'dispersed,' Kennedy interjected, 'You say you are going to take 10,000 black people and move them into Orange County?' ''</p>
        <p>Robert Kennedy was not only less liberal but less intellectual than nostalgic mythology would have it. Thomas dismisses Michael Knox Beran's claim, in his recent book, ''The Last Patrician,'' that Kennedy's speeches on poverty in January 1966 were ''as momentous an event in the history of the welfare state as any.'' In Thomas's view, ''the speeches, taken as a whole, contain a good deal of 1960's liberal boilerplate.'' Kennedy ''listened to Bob Dylan, but more often to Broadway show tunes. He named sons born in 1965 and 1967 after pillars of the establishment -- a hawkish chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Maxwell Taylor (Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy), and two patrician statesmen, Douglas Dillon and Averell Harriman (Douglas Harriman Kennedy).'' Like his brother, Kennedy ensured that his historical reputation would be greater than his accomplishments by inviting prominent intellectuals to sail and swim and by quizzing them on trendy topics like existentialism and alienation. Of Camus's ''Resistance, Rebellion, and Death,'' Kennedy observed sagely: ''That book is really depressing. And long.''</p>
        <p>''It is a reach,'' Thomas observes, ''to compare Kennedy's travails as the neglected little brother to the despair of ghetto dwellers, but Kennedy seemed to feel a direct kinship with the troubled youth of any time and place.'' Thomas is right -- it is a reach. Lapses like this into the rhetoric of hagiography do not alter the cumulative effect of Thomas's well-documented book, which is to confirm many of the charges made by critics of the Kennedys. Sometimes Thomas tries to soften the blow: ''The messy collision of Kennedy's war on crime with his war on Castro, aggravated by his brother's poor taste in paramours, is the worst chapter in an otherwise noble career of public service.'' This is a polite way of saying that the attorney general of the United States hesitated to prosecute certain gangsters because his brother the president had slept with the mistress of a Mafia don and because with the Kennedys' approval the C.I.A. had connived with the Mafia to kill Castro.</p>
        <p>From today's perspective, the Kennedy administration scandals look like the Lewinsky affair, Watergate and Iran-contra rolled into one tabloid extravaganza. The scandals no longer shock us, but perhaps they should. Relying on the recent research of Aleksandr Fursenko and Timothy Naftali in the Soviet archives, Thomas writes that in 1964, ''in an irresponsible and potentially mischievous act of backdoor diplomacy, a Kennedy acolyte, New York painter William Walton, was sent to the Soviet Union to meet with R.F.K.'s old back-channel friend Georgi Bolshakov.'' Walton told the Soviets that the Kennedys regarded Lyndon Johnson as a ''clever time-server incapable of realizing Kennedy's unfinished plans'' and said that ''R.F.K. intended to run for president, probably in 1968. The Soviets, who considered R.F.K. more of a hard-liner than his brother, were not noticeably moved.'' If Kennedy authorized Walton's statements, this is a bombshell. Even if Walton spoke for himself rather than for Kennedy, by what authority did the attorney general hide his secret communications with the Soviet leadership from the government in which he served?</p>
        <p>For years, journalists and historians have denounced Richard Nixon for using a back channel to America's South Vietnamese allies in 1968 to undermine the Humphrey campaign; the charge that the Reagan campaign had used a back channel to Iran to ensure that the hostages would not be released until after the 1980 election -- the ''October surprise'' -- would have destroyed Reagan's reputation, if it had been true. But Thomas, having accurately described this back-channel subversion of a sitting president by his attorney general as ''seditious,'' simply moves on without further comment. And why not? Even today, the Kennedys are not held to the same standards that journalists and historians apply to other American politicians. As Thomas observes in terms that apply to John Kennedy as much as to Robert, ''Kennedy had become a vast screen upon which others projected their hopes and fears.''</p>
