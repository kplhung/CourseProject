        <p>WHEN E. Elias Merhige's ''Shadow of the Vampire,'' with its attention-snagging stars John Malkovich and Willem Dafoe, opens on Dec. 29, it will mark at least the fourth time that filmmakers have resuscitated this particular version of the vampire: Nosferatu, that disturbingly peculiar and apparently iconic figure created by an odd little group of Germans 79 years ago.</p>
        <p>The premise of Mr. Merhige's film is that in making ''Nosferatu,'' the first vampire movie and one of the silent cinema's masterpieces, the legendary director F. W. Murnau employed a real vampire in the title role. The conceit is understandable to anyone who's seen the original film: Murnau; his art director, Albin Grau; and his screenwriter, Henrik Galeen, all must have rummaged around in their psychic basements in order to help Max Schreck (whose last name, conveniently, means terror or horror in German) generate a performance that's conversation-stopping in its sinister strangeness and dignified repulsiveness. If there's anyone in film history who seems to have wandered in from another world, it's Schreck's Nosferatu, evoking at once, through his makeup and manner, rat, spider and skull. He's the unsettling center of a film that moved figures as diverse as Andre Breton and Jack Kerouac to rhapsodies and that continues to influence filmmakers to this day.</p>

        <p>WHEN E. Elias Merhige's ''Shadow of the Vampire,'' with its attention-snagging stars John Malkovich and Willem Dafoe, opens on Dec. 29, it will mark at least the fourth time that filmmakers have resuscitated this particular version of the vampire: Nosferatu, that disturbingly peculiar and apparently iconic figure created by an odd little group of Germans 79 years ago.</p>
        <p>The premise of Mr. Merhige's film is that in making ''Nosferatu,'' the first vampire movie and one of the silent cinema's masterpieces, the legendary director F. W. Murnau employed a real vampire in the title role. The conceit is understandable to anyone who's seen the original film: Murnau; his art director, Albin Grau; and his screenwriter, Henrik Galeen, all must have rummaged around in their psychic basements in order to help Max Schreck (whose last name, conveniently, means terror or horror in German) generate a performance that's conversation-stopping in its sinister strangeness and dignified repulsiveness. If there's anyone in film history who seems to have wandered in from another world, it's Schreck's Nosferatu, evoking at once, through his makeup and manner, rat, spider and skull. He's the unsettling center of a film that moved figures as diverse as Andre Breton and Jack Kerouac to rhapsodies and that continues to influence filmmakers to this day.</p>
        <p>The most flat-footed evidence of influence, of course, involves the direct re-creations. First Werner Herzog paid homage to the film in 1979 by remaking it, at times nearly shot for shot, with Klaus Kinski -- who himself might have been the 70's graven image of sinister strangeness and dignified repulsiveness. Then Tobe Hooper decided that the vampire in his 1979 television film ''Salem's Lot,'' based on the Stephen King novel, would have Schreck's look: cadaverously egg-headed, with fanged front teeth like small ice picks, ears that suggest some crossbreeding with bats, and outlandishly long claws. And Nicolas Cage -- one of the producers of ''Shadow of the Vampire'' -- took a turn with the Schreck look himself, with frequently hilarious results, in Robert Bierman's 1989 horror comedy ''Vampire's Kiss.''</p>
        <p>In ''Shadow of the Vampire,'' Willem Dafoe, as Schreck, also intermittently plays his overall grotesquerie for laughs. His performance is congruent with John Malkovich's, whose Herr Direktor Murnau flamboyantly loses his Teutonic reserve every five minutes. Even so, as the film progresses, the horsing around gives way to the resiliently predatory frightfulness of Nosferatu's appearance.</p>
        <p>But ''Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror'' -- its full title -- is not one of the most celebrated films of the silent period just because it featured a scary vampire. Murnau's first nine films were lost; he owes his status among cineastes to ''Nosferatu'' and the movies that followed it -- especially ''Der Letzte Mann,''  ''Faust,''  ''Sunrise'' and ''Tabu.'' (He was killed in 1931, when his Packard overturned outside Santa Barbara, Calif., just before the premiere of ''Tabu.'') He's generally credited with having been the first to understand the expressive potential of the moving camera, in ''Der Letzte Mann'' (released in the United States as ''The Last Laugh''). But four years earlier, with ''Nosferatu,'' he was already one of the first to consistently design individual shots -- referred to as tableaus by early filmmakers -- as not simply static compositions but negotiable spaces open to every sort of intrusion and transformation. He turned ''Nosferatu'' into an inventory of entries and exits, of trajectories in which the frame was explored in unexpectedly eloquent ways; and in doing so, he further liberated movies from their theatrical mind-set.</p>
        <p>For their plot, Murnau and Galeen pillaged Bram Stoker's ''Dracula'' (without troubling themselves about permissions), and the vampire's liminal status (dead or alive? part of our world or wholly Other?) was beautifully suited to Murnau's larger cinematic project. Each character in the film has his or her own way of moving, of making visually tangible what each represents. Hutter, the Jonathan Harker figure, is all doltish energy and precipitous rushing about, always active and never effective; his wife, Ellen, responds with a resigned and somnambulant grace. Nosferatu, meanwhile, maintains the stillness of a figure in a bad dream or a spider on its web. He rises from his coffin like a plank. He ascends stairs with an awful, quick-footed walk. His shadow spreads across walls or bedclothes like an ink stain. He appropriates and contaminates whatever space he's in. His initial stalking of Hutter is rendered from Hutter's point of view in a series of dissolves that mimic the mechanism of nightmare, the vampire's frozen figure nonetheless becoming progressively larger: he isn't moving, but he keeps getting closer. And in one of the most disturbingly beautiful shots in film history, his quietly insidious arrival in Bremen is heralded by his ship's smoothly innocuous glide into a static and placid long shot of the harbor.</p>
        <p>In ''Nosferatu,'' Murnau is hybridizing two approaches that seemed opposed in the early 20's: the expressionism of German films like ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' and the depiction of the sweep and luminosity of nature displayed in the films of Scandinavians like Carl Theodor Dreyer and Victor Sjostrom. For Murnau, the real world contained all that was necessary to obtain whatever emotional or atmospheric effect was required, and how something was photographed made all the difference. Much of the power of ''Nosferatu'' comes from its efficacy at rendering the permeability of the border between the familiar and the uncanny and presenting us with a nature that seems to operate, as one critic put it, ''under the shadow of the supernatural.'' The oblique neutrality of waves in the moonlight, the balky jumpiness of horses in a field, wind-swept dunes spotted with listing and canted crosses: Murnau's genius at infusing apparent tranquillity with an underlying unease and dread has inspired countless films as diverse as Peter Weir's ''Picnic at Hanging Rock'' and Jacques Tournier's ''Cat People.''</p>
        <p>None of that, though, gets at how truly weird ''Nosferatu'' is. The scenes between Hutter and Ellen feel bizarrely charged even before he leaves for the castle; Knock, the house agent who is Hutter's boss, seems to be practicing a kind of homespun diabolism before the vampire even arrives to take possession of his new home; and Hutter, after his escape from the castle, noticeably dawdles in his race with the vampire to his hometown. The film's structure seems to insist that we not single out the vampire as its only source of anxiety: once he arrives in Bremen we spend eight minutes on the plague that's accompanied him, and then yet more time with Knock, who's institutionalized like Stoker's Renfield and then escapes and is pursued around Bremen, looking like Mr. Pickwick on a rampage.</p>
        <p>The viewer begins to realize that various juxtaposed elements are intended to have more of a metaphoric than strictly narrative relationship, as we're repeatedly presented with visual juxtapositions that seem to assert that the polarities we expect will be maintained -- like purity and corruption, innocence and knowledge, or desire and repulsion -- are breaking down. The morning after Hutter's first night in the castle, he notices marks on his throat in the mirror, and smiles. At the moment of his greatest danger the next night, with him in a swoon and his baleful, implacable host looming over his bed, we cut suddenly to Ellen, back in Bremen, sitting bolt upright in her bed, stretching out her arms and calling to him. But it's Nosferatu who responds, turning from his prey and gazing offscreen in a perfect eyeline match, confirming the film's insistent subversive implication that the pure at heart are as much on the monster's wavelength as those already given over to perdition. (The diabolic Knock and Ellen are from the very beginning sensitized to the vampire's approach.) Our unease is then masterfully underlined by our sense that the explanatory intertitles at times misrepresent the images: ''Hutter, far away, had heard her cry of warning,'' we're told immediately after Ellen's call has apparently lured Nosferatu away from her husband. But her husband was clearly visible, and out like a light; he hadn't heard anything.</p>
        <p>As successfully as any film ever has, then, ''Nosferatu'' poses the question at the heart of expressionism: Where does the infected soul stop and the world begin? Hutter and Ellen, reunited in Bremen, kiss, and we cut to a close-up of Nosferatu, who smiles.</p>
        <p>All of this becomes somewhat more resonant when we remember that Murnau, born Friedrich Plumpe, was semivoluntarily exiled from his family because of his sexual orientation; the exile left him feeling both a part of the world around him and something else altogether. He would have been aware of a belief among Slovakians that vampires came from the ranks of those excommunicated from the church, or from their own lives: suicides, apostates and those cursed by their parents. He certainly must have registered at least what Stoker did: the usefulness of vampirism as a way of animating the unspeakable.</p>
        <p>One of the most noticeable differences in Murnau's version of the Dracula legend is the way he dumped Stoker's Christian metaphysic entirely. None of the sacred ammunition that Stoker provides -- communion wafers, holy water, crucifixes -- have any role; instead, Galeen and Murnau's contribution to the genre is the destructive power of daylight: nature itself takes care of a problem that seems to be a dark parody of its own fertility. (''From the seed of Belial,'' we're told, the vampire has sprung, and he sails to Bremen on a ship called the Demeter.)</p>
        <p>The figure of Nosferatu in that light becomes readable as a grotesque and frightening form of desire, a version of the awakened or indulged wish that's both irresistibly powerful and pestilentially dangerous. The figure of Van Helsing, representing rational science and hardy, masculine, can-do industry, is completely ineffectual in Murnau's version, dozing through the crisis and arriving too late to help; instead, Ellen faces the threat alone.</p>
        <p>We make the shocking transition from the irritating and frenetic digression of Knock's pursuit to the utter stillness of Nosferatu, gazing out from the window of a creepily dilapidated house that sits directly opposite Ellen's, like a real estate version of the unconscious. Ellen bolts awake. Hutter, naturally, does not. She wakes him and sends him for help. Then, after some agonizing, she throws open the gateway of her window -- in a film filled with gateways and portals -- inviting Nosferatu in.</p>
        <p>What follows is rightly famous. He leaves the window. She staggers drunkenly, her head in her hands. His shadow mounts a staircase. His shadow pauses outside her door, its fingers extending elastically across the wall to the knob in an unforgettable visualization of the vampire's defiling reach. In bed, with him offscreen, she jerks her head down in anticipation of his touch, and the shadow of his hand and arm spread upward across her white dressing gown. The shadow-fist seizes her heart, leaving her in something between rapture and agony. We crosscut between the disturbingly intimate and understated image of him feeding at her neck in a long shot of the room and Hutter not hurrying back(!) with the groggy Van Helsing figure in tow.</p>
        <p>HER sacrifice succeeds: Nosferatu is caught by the cock's crow, loses his malevolent power and staggers around in the sunlight like someone having a coronary. He dissolves, the same cinematic technology used to create him erasing him. And then the most disturbing -- and often unremarked-upon -- turn occurs. Knock, apparently returned to his cell, pronounces his master's death. Hutter continues to stroll home. Ellen lasts long enough to fall into Hutter's embrace upon his return, and she dies in his arms, her sacrifice complete. Hutter grieves on her bed while keeping one foot still primly on the floor. The intertitle announces, ''At that very hour the Great Death ceased and the shadow of the vampire vanished as if overcome by the victorious rays of the living sun'': the good news everyone's been waiting for. Except Murnau was careful to have it follow not the monster's death, which had taken place four scenes earlier, but Ellen's death. It's her death that's required, and her death that abolishes the taint. And the film's insistence on the necessity of destroying what it claims it most values may be its only real perverseness.</p>
