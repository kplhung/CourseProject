        <p>RENEE ZELLWEGER, from a distance, has all the trappings of a rising Hollywood starlet: the blond hair, the thin frame, the bee-stung lips, the colorful but homespun childhood in Texas, no formal acting training and a boyfriend who gets $20 million per picture.</p>
        <p>So when she arrives in a big black SUV with her dog at her favorite coffee shop on Sunset Boulevard and suggests a late-morning hike, it might seem as if this outdoorsy scene has been as strategically scripted as a movie montage.</p>
        <p>But it takes only a two-hour trek through Runyon Park to discover that Ms. Zellweger, though best known for playing Tom Cruise's girlfriend in her breakthrough role in  ''Jerry Maguire'' in 1996 and, more recently, Jim Carrey's girlfriend in this summer's ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' is not simply another actress who has succeeded by perfecting the art of playing herself.</p>
        <p>It turns out that Ms. Zellweger, who is leaving the girlfriend parts behind with starring roles in two new movies, Neil LaBute's black comedy ''Nurse Betty'' and an adaptation of Helen Fielding's best-selling novel ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' is actually a character actress trapped in the body of an ingenue.</p>
        <p>This revelation has nothing to do with the fact that Ms. Zellweger has shown up in sweats, running shoes, no makeup; talks to anyone she meets; and blithely hikes straight up the steep hills in the searing lateAugust sun without so much as a sip of water or a drop of sunscreen on her lily-white skin.</p>
        <p>It doesn't come just from anything she says, either, though she is warm and chatty, especially when talking about something other than herself.</p>
        <p>Rather, it comes from what Ms. Zellweger does not say, which is considerable, and how strikingly different she is from the characters she plays in ''Nurse Betty,'' which opened Friday, or ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' arriving in spring.</p>
        <p>''Both of them seemed a little scary to do,'' Ms. Zellweger says. ''And that was the appeal. They were both a really complicated challenge.''</p>
        <p>In ''Nurse Betty,'' Ms. Zellweger plays a naive small-town wife who is traumatized after witnessing her husband's murder and becomes fixated on traveling to Los Angeles to find the handsome doctor she watches on her favorite soap opera. As Bridget Jones, she is the neurotic 30-something ''singleton'' who drinks and smokes too much while obsessing about how to land a man.</p>
        <p>It is not inconceivable that Ms. Zellweger, 31, could have drawn on her own life to play both roles. Her character in ''Nurse Betty'' develops a real-life psychological disorder called a disassociative fugue, which usually surfaces after a trauma or life-changing event and causes a person to flee.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zellweger researched the condition and consulted a psychologist who specializes in treating the disorder before she tackled the role. ''It's mystical almost,'' she says of the illness. ''It's unbelievably bizarre, but learning about it was half the fun of the job.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Zellweger experienced a different kind of shock in 1995 when, after a few minor roles in small, Texas-based independent films, in B-movies like ''The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' and in the critically acclaimed but little-seen love story ''The Whole Wide World,'' she was chosen to play opposite Tom Cruise in ''Jerry Maguire.'' The film went on to make $240 million and made Ms. Zellweger a star.</p>
        <p>Up until then, her life had been remarkably parochial. She grew up in Katy, Tex. (pop. 12,500), just outside Houston, with a Swiss father and Norwegian mother who immigrated to Texas after their marriage. Ms. Zellweger graduated from the University of Texas and began her acting career in the Austin area with a beef commercial.</p>
        <p>Yet by all accounts, far from going into any fugue state, Ms. Zellweger remained exactly the same after ''Jerry Maguire.'' She has just moved into a new $1.5 million home in Nichols Canyon in the trendy Hollywood Hills and has been involved with Mr. Carrey since they made ''Irene'' last summer, but her most constant companion is still her 12-year-old collie-retriever mix, Dylan. ''There's very little that's worth everything to me,'' she says calmly. ''I love my job, I love what I do. I couldn't ask for a better life. But I'd be O.K. if this all went away and I had to do something else, too.''</p>
        <p>Those who have read ''Bridget Jones's Diary'' know that such sanguine, Zen-like sentiments are hardly what the nakedly ambitious and chronically dissatisfied Bridget, a publicist turned wacky television feature correspondent, would be likely to utter.</p>
        <p>There was controversy, mostly stirred up by the British tabloids, over the selection of Ms. Zellweger for the part, since she is American. ''Don't think I didn't have a lot of nightmares and sleepless nights,'' says Sharon Maguire, the director, of her decision to hire Ms. Zellweger after a lengthy search (which included British actresses). ''After she came in, I thought, 'She's perfect but she's a Texan. What do we do?' ''</p>
        <p>In the end, Ms. Maguire was won over by Ms. Zellweger's promise that she would nail the accent. ''Her attitude was, 'If I don't get this accent right, we are both so busted,' '' Ms. Maguire says. ''She worked really hard and I think she got it.''</p>
        <p>To ensure that she got it, Ms. Zellweger was asked by the filmmakers to come to London three months early to study with a dialect coach and immerse herself in the culture. She even went undercover, using the name Bridget Cavendish, at the Picador publishing company in London for two weeks, calling editors to ask them to review books, skimming the newspapers for pertinent articles and getting coffee for the executives.</p>
        <p>Throughout her seven-month stay in London, she spoke with a British accent.</p>
        <p>''It was very technical,'' says Ms. Zellweger. ''They wanted a very specific accent from a particular social class in a particular area outside London. We started by overenunciating and speaking the Queen's English, then taking it back a notch. It got to be a habit.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Zellweger even used her newly acquired accent when she met her co-stars Hugh Grant, who plays the caddish Daniel Cleaver, and Colin Firth, who plays Mark Darcy, on the set. ''They were really kind about it. They knew I wasn't some geek trying to sound English. They knew it was part of the job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carrey, who visited Ms. Zellweger but mostly spoke to her by telephone from the United States, was less understanding. ''I'd call my boyfriend and he couldn't take it,'' she says. ''He'd ask me to please speak normally.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Zellweger also had to gain about 17 pounds for the part. Usually she is a size 2 and loves to run or hike every day, but in London she went on a nutritionist-guided diet to pack on pounds and was forbidden to exercise. ''I'd have an omelet with cheese and sauce for breakfast with a fatty yogurt and then a fruit salad with a topping and juice and coffee and cream and a bagel with butter and a few hours later a chocolate shake with weight-gain powder in it,'' she says. ''It was like, do the research, learn your lines, eat the shake. It was all part of the job.''</p>
        <p>But learning to talk and eat like Bridget Jones may have been the easy part for Ms. Zellweger. Truly becoming Bridget, which means being blunt, impolitic, gossipy, envious, needy and a little too obvious about everything, must have been like acquiring the traits of an alien.</p>
        <p>In person, she is relentlessly positive, eager to see, as she puts it, ''the good in everybody,'' and will not utter a negative word about anyone or anything. She says she has not had one really bad experience in her career.</p>
        <p>Often, she firmly but politely says, ''I don't know'' to even the most softball questions.</p>
        <p>IN a move too cool for the perpetually desperate Bridget, Ms. Zellweger became legendary for what she said to Cameron Crowe, the director of ''Jerry Maguire,'' when he called to tell her she had the part of Dorothy Boyd. ''What makes you think I want it?'' she replied. Ms. Zellweger, who is normally unfailingly pleasant, says she acted flippant because she thought Mr. Crowe was joking.</p>
        <p>Almost everything -- her role in ''The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,'' her pre-''Jerry Maguire'' job bussing tables at the Three Clubs in Hollywood, even having to gain weight in London -- was a ''gift'' or a ''learning experience.'' She is equally enthusiastic about her co-stars, like Mr. Cruise or Meryl Streep, whom she reveres and with whom she starred in ''One True Thing'' (1998). She frequently labels both her colleagues and all her adventures ''fantastic!'' and ''amazing!''  ''I've just been showered with good fortune,'' she says, in most un-Bridget fashion.</p>
        <p>Yet while that may sound annoying, the net effect is that you admire Ms. Zellweger for refusing to disclose her own personal struggles and pain. In fact, she comes across as if straight from the pages of another best seller, the often-scorned 1995 book ''The Rules,'' which advocates setting strong boundaries and saying no whenever possible in order to get a man and get ahead. ''I know how people can get hurt by what you say, so I don't feel a need to share everything about myself,'' she says. ''Just because I'm an actress shouldn't mean that I can just talk about difficult things that involve other people.''</p>
        <p>It is hard to find anyone who will do anything except gush about Ms. Zellweger. But some of her directors, while fans, hint that there is some steel under the sugar. ''I think she's very savvy underneath about a lot of things,'' Mr. LaBute says. ''But I don't think it's anything dark. I think Renee just braced herself to deal with an industry that can be crushing and made the decision to be buoyant as a way to rise above it all.''</p>
        <p>Peter Farrelly, who directed Ms. Zellweger and Mr. Carrey in ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' has said Mr. Carrey fell in love with Ms. Zellweger during filming but she was unresponsive. Mr. Farrelly said Mr. Carrey was a ''whipped puppy'' and that she ''played him like a violin.'' The two did not get together romantically until after the movie wrapped.</p>
        <p>''I was not played like a violin,'' says Mr. Carrey stiffly, if a little unconvincingly, when asked. ''Neither of us were playing or were played.''</p>
        <p>But when asked what makes Ms. Zellweger different from other actresses he has worked with, Mr. Carrey could have been describing her on or off screen.</p>
        <p>''It's her ability to withhold her emotions,'' he says. ''She has it all working inside, but she doesn't prostitute her feelings. A lot of actresses can't wait to show their feelings all over the place. As a result, when you finally see a glimpse of Renee's feelings -- it's something much more powerful.''</p>
        <p>The best way to glimpse those feelings from Ms. Zellweger is to knock off the formal interview and talk hiking or some other outdoor activity. At the moment she's excited about her coming trip to the Palm Springs area. True to form, she won't be kicking back and pounding down the margaritas either. ''My friends think I'm crazy,'' she says. ''But I love it when it's like 120 degrees and I go running. It feels great. Fantastic!''</p>
