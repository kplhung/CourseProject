        <p>IN 1972, Wilbur Breslin bought 1,150 acres of land near Exit 68 of the Long Island Expressway and continued shopping until he had accumulated over 2,000 acres in the Town of Brookhaven. The property sprawled across the L.I.E. and into the heart of the undeveloped Pine Barrens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Breslin's plans for the property were vague and spurred considerable interest: What would he do with so much raw land, so far from the Island's population centers?</p>
        <p>The speculation continued until March 1989, when Mr. Breslin, a Garden City developer, announced plans for a massive regional development, the Brookhaven Town Center, incorporating a shopping mall at the L.I.E. and William Floyd Parkway in Yaphank and residential, commercial and manufacturing space on surrounding sites.  The plans struck many as grandiose and ill-considered, and others as visionary and progressive. But nearly everyone agreed that the plans challenged conventional thinking.</p>
        <p>Situated far east of the region's population centers in Nassau County, and its commercial centers, which as one broker said ''stopped dead in Hauppauge and Islandia,'' the Brookhaven Town Center project loomed impossibly large. The sheer scale of the planned mini-city inspired ''Willy World'' jokes. Initially proposed at 1.6 million square feet and with six anchor tenants, the complex would have been the Island's largest shopping mall. Mr. Breslin would even have a ready pool of shoppers: there would be as many as 12,655 residences, 1.3 million square feet of office and industrial space, and a hotel.</p>
        <p>The project was originally scheduled to be completed sometime this year. That it has not received approval from the town did not stop Mr. Breslin from leveling 150 acres. That decision antagonized the conservation groups, which had blocked him in court.</p>
        <p>''That was a barbaric act,'' said Marilyn England, the president of Open Space Council, based in Brookhaven. ''Did he feel if he did that we would go away?''</p>
        <p>Howard Blankman, Mr. Breslin's spokesman, responded that the developer had obtained a permit to clear the land.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, opponents of the project are, at least in theory, supporters of mixed-use development, one of the original plan's fundamental characteristics even if that fact seems to have fallen off the table. Eleven years ago, mixed use was almost unheard of on Long Island. Associated with high-density development, it connoted urban problems and was resisted with passion by Long Islanders. Today, it is increasingly known as Smart Growth and promoted as a solution to a host of suburban problems ranging from sprawl to traffic to housing.</p>
        <p>''Mixed use is a good thing for Long Island,'' said David Pennetta, a partner in Oxford &amp; Simpson Realty, a commercial real estate brokerage firm in Jericho.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pennetta, who was involved in the project in an earlier phase but is not involved today, said that Mr. Breslin had offered a visionary plan. ''The history of Long Island retail development,'' Mr. Pennetta said, ''has been putting up stores surrounded by parking lots. This project was about creating not just shopping, but a community: manufacturing and office jobs, restaurants, hotel rooms, sports and more. It was about creating a mini-city. It's the kind of  thing that is good for Long Island and should be supported.''</p>
        <p>Traffic? ''I think you can make a case that instead of creating more traffic, a mixed-use project actually cuts back on it,'' Mr. Pennetta said. ''Instead of driving all over the place for this and for that, what you need is located in one place. As a result, there is less driving on the Expressway.''</p>
        <p>Conservationists, who might be Mr. Breslin's logical allies, disagree. Vehemently.</p>
        <p>''Mixed use is good, but the issue is where you put it,'' said Richard Amper, the executive director of the Pine Barrens Society in Riverhead and a leading opponent of the project. ''Here it's suburban sprawl on a huge scale. We have dying downtowns in Hempstead and Bay Shore and Patchogue, where there's already infrastructure like sewage and water and access to transportation. This project targets the last unspoiled place on Long Island for urban-type development. It's the wrong thing at the wrong place at the wrong time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Breslin disputed that. ''People on Long Island have not understood mixed use,'' he said. ''I have been an advocate of mixed use for years. Yet when you're a developer, somehow no one believes you. I've sat through presentations on mixed use by advocates who came prepared to debate me. When they finished, all I said was: 'Fine. You have no problem with me.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Breslin estimates he has spent over $4 million meeting environmental study requirements and defending the project in lawsuits. Since the project was announced he's employed Mr. Blankman's public-relations agency. Still, Mr. Breslin said, environmentalists have managed to stir public opinion against him.</p>
        <p>''Dick Amper got all his people behind him, the environmentalists,'' Mr. Breslin said.</p>
        <p>As with any development project awaiting official approval, public opinion matters enormously. Three Town of Brookhaven officials -- Supervisor Felix Grucci Jr.; Kevin Molloy, a town spokesman; and John Girandola, the town planning board commissioner -- did not respond to telephone messages asking for comment. Anthony Aloisio,  the director of the town's Industrial Development Agency, said he knew little about the project.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the prolonged approval process has kept Mr. Breslin and his sales team busy keeping retailers' commitments warm. It's been a Catch-22: without major tenants, no building; without bricks and mortar, no one signs contracts. Without town approval, no financing. And so on.</p>
        <p>In August 1999, after 10 years of negotiating, Mr. Breslin brought a new partner on board. Allan V. Rose, another veteran developer active in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, now controls about three-quarters of the property.</p>
        <p>Insiders say the arrival of Mr. Rose has re-energized negotiations. This summer, after more than a decade, the mall seemed ready to move forward by scaling back: the partners informed the town that instead of six anchor stores, there would be four, and instead of 1.6 million square feet, there would be one million. The partners plan to break ground next spring, Mr. Blankman said.</p>
        <p>The Town of Brookhaven promptly announced that this would necessitate filing a new environmental impact statement. The earlier one, supporting the original plans, weighed in at 42 pounds.</p>
        <p>So far, there is little evidence the scaling back will pacify opponents, who are quick to speculate on the damage the mall would inflict on everything from the nesting habits of endangered birds to the Main Street shopping habits of Long Islanders.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Breslin's friends and supporters, the resistance is difficult to fathom. They describe the developer as a builder of the old school who does what he promises and cares about Long Island. ''Willy has the ability to sense your credibility,'' Mr. Pennetta said, ''and can work out in his head whether a deal is going to come together or not. If the picture has to change for the deal to happen, he knows that, and somehow the picture changes.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Breslin said: ''Would I do it again, if I knew then what it would be like? What's it been like is getting stuck in quicksand.''</p>
