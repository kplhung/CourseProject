      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>When the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten opened an outpost of his restaurant, Vong, in Hong Kong in 1997, there was a predictable scramble for tables. But today, the real action is at the bar -- a sleek, dimly lighted oasis where a chic crowd gathers to knock back the stiffest martinis in town (about $12.50, plus tax).</p>
        <p>Set on the top floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Vong has a dazzling view of Hong Kong's kaleidoscopic skyline. The Mandarin sits in a glade of even taller buildings. So peering out Vong's floor-to-ceiling windows is a bit like sitting on the front porch on an extremely starry night.</p>

        <p>When the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten opened an outpost of his restaurant, Vong, in Hong Kong in 1997, there was a predictable scramble for tables. But today, the real action is at the bar -- a sleek, dimly lighted oasis where a chic crowd gathers to knock back the stiffest martinis in town (about $12.50, plus tax).</p>
        <p>Set on the top floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Vong has a dazzling view of Hong Kong's kaleidoscopic skyline. The Mandarin sits in a glade of even taller buildings. So peering out Vong's floor-to-ceiling windows is a bit like sitting on the front porch on an extremely starry night.</p>
        <p>The view inside is only slightly less sparkling. Hong Kong people are not shy about flaunting their possessions; the patrons of Vong arrive in polished Prada mules, carrying Fendi bags. On Friday evenings, after Hong Kong's skyscrapers disgorge stockbrokers, currency traders and other high-finance types, the bar fills up with a happy-hour crowd that can be noisy but is rarely raucous.</p>
        <p>Vong's decor is sophisticated, though not at the expense of comfort. Couples and groups sit on velvet-covered chairs around low tables, while the singles -- and the handful of cigar smokers -- hunker around the clamshell-shaped bar. Waiters wear green trousers and green sweaters with gold dragon logos.</p>
        <p>Vong serves a full range of drinks, but make no mistake: this is a martini bar. Served in chilled, double-size glasses -- and shaken by the waiters at your table -- these are state-of-the-art concoctions. They are also lethal. For those who don't want to drink a tumbler's worth of vodka or gin, there are variations on the theme, such as the Faa martini, with vodka-marinated litchis and mangoes.</p>
        <p>Vong's bartenders behave with the coolness of 747 pilots flying through turbulence. When the tables are packed and the crowd at the bar is three deep, they briskly shake their martinis, handing over drink after perfectly chilled drink. Find a seat with a view of the bar and watch the shakers fly.</p>
