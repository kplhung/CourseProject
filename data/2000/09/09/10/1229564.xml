        <p>A Brief History of Flattery.</p>

        <p>Flattery will get you nowhere, or so they say. It hasn't always been the case. In fact, as Richard Stengel magnificently demonstrates (do I overstate?), ingratiation has been a fundamental, perhaps an evolutionary aim of most social behavior and polite speech. ''You're Too Kind'' embraces the history of flattery from its origins in encomiums engraved on Egyptian tombs to the demagogy of the Presidential Point (presidents, beginning with Reagan, Stengel notes, pretend to pick out a familiar face in the crowd and nudge the wife, who also points and smiles: our rulers flatter us by appearing to be just like us, ''actually having friends''). Moving from Yahweh's need of flattery to the candor of Greece and the obsequiousness of Rome on down to Dick Morris and Bill Clinton, who flatters his interlocutors by intently listening, Stengel is able triumphantly to conclude (am I reaching too high?) that flattery is more pervasively present than ever, although disguised and venally debased in these relativizing times, in this age of irony.</p>
        <p>Stengel shows that flattery, starting with strategic praise of superiors (apple-polishing) or inferiors (management), continues to be an indispensable weapon in all manner of political and personal struggles. The business of advertising constitutes a vast industry devoted to puffery. Flattery -- the word, the thing, the concept -- turns out to be everywhere. In an appendix, Stengel lists over 200 synonyms for ''flatter'' and ''flattery.'' To take only the B's, there's: back-scratching, banana oil, beflatter, beslaver, beslobber, blandishments, blarney, blow smoke, boot-licker, boot-kisser, butter, butter up -- to cite a few. The word flatter, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, has a doubtful etymology. Stengel prefers the derivation from the Old French verb flater, to flatten or smooth, which also means to stroke, massage or caress -- as with compliments. In a superb epilogue, Stengel even provides the reader with exhausting instructions on how to flatter better. (How am I doing?)</p>
        <p>Flattery, of course, has had a bad name since the Greeks, implying wrongful praise. Nothing is more flattering than to be told that you hate flattery. But if it's a crime, it is a victimless one: the flattered is a co-conspirator. For the most part, flattery is harmless: surrounding the flattered with a halo of good feeling, it gives away nothing really worth having, but it may get a lot in return.</p>
        <p>In the narrowest sense, flattery is a certain use of articulated language shaped by rhetorical figures and conceits -- by the use, say, of hyperbole: extravagantly exaggerating the value of something in order to persuade. Under the ancien regime, for example, the chief path for approaching the king was speech used in the service of acquiring his benevolence and favor. However, in its broadest definition, flattery is a form of bowing and scraping, social behavior for which words are not necessary -- an evolutionary strategy for survival, as Stengel puts it, ''of the most unctuous.'' Flattery is the defensive weapon with which inferiors placate superiors, thereby avoid being killed, optimize their relationships and achieve a sort of ''devious cooperation.''+ ''Not just a 'cost-benefit calculus,' ''flattery is ''a form of generosity,''+ ''reciprocal altruism'': I magnify you, confirm your self-love, so that you are well disposed toward me. It is the function implicit in the behavior of a second-rank chimpanzee when he grooms an alpha male.</p>
        <p>Only Richard Stengel, both a professor at Princeton and an editor at Time magazine, could write a history of something so diverse and ill-defined, so multiple and ephemeral as flattery. It may be, as he finally suggests, the principal reason we even open our mouths -- if not to eat. Perhaps all language is employed in the service of achieving an advantageous transformation of the other and thus inescapably implies that some flattery is going on. ''We never even consider complete openness and frankness as a response to social conditions,'' Stengel writes ''We have all learned to nod and smile and hold our tongue and murmur approval and say thank you.'' Saying thank you is an implicit form of flattery in that it indicates your dependence on some other person's grace. But so is keeping quiet. Silence may often be a form of elliptical flattery -- saying less than what might be said, as when you minimize someone's faults and failings, or pointedly ignore some glaring deformity.</p>
        <p>In fact, the best flattery -- perhaps the only convincing flattery -- is the sort that is never observed. Seduction goes unnoticed when the flattered is being skillfully told the very thing he wants most to hear about himself. As Casanova taught, you always tell beauty it's intelligent, and intelligence that it's beautiful. Similarly, the most successful flatterers are not vulgarly hypocritical but rather those who believe their own lies. If I am aware I'm flattering, my self-knowledge playing across my face may well be detected by an observant interlocutor on the lookout for empty praise. If, however, I've convinced myself of my deception, my palaver will more convincingly persuade. Indeed, the purest flattery -- the sort most surely liable to work -- occurs when neither the flattered nor the flatterer knows it is going on.</p>
        <p>But how do you write a brief history of that? It might have to be what Foucault would have called an ''archaeology of silence.'' To write a history of something so ill-defined, so diverse and ephemeral, so frequently silent, invisible and unavowed, requires a truly special sort of historian, like Stengel. It helps that to him the past teaches nothing; it merely prefigures the present, anticipates what we know already from television and popular culture. There is no history, only anachrony (and jarring atonality). He writes, for example, that Gorgias was the ''Tony Robbins'' of ancient Athens, the troubadours were the ''Beatles of the early Middle Ages,''+ ''Sammy Glicks with mandolins.'' Ralph Waldo Emerson was ''also the copywriter of all modern athletic shoe advertising: 'Be all you can be,' 'Just do it.''</p>
        <p>Flattery is a vast and interesting topic, but also an airy, shifty one. Stengel has given us less a brief history than an anecdotal genealogy of ingratiation in a book that is conceptually unfocused and surprisingly graceless, i.e., uningratiating. But let us thank him anyway and sing his praises! Who among us doesn't need to think some more these days about the art of blowing sugar and the science of kissing up?</p>
