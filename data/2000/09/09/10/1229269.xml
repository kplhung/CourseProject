        <p>GABRIELA'S  +  (212) 875-8532; 311 Amsterdam Avenue, at 75th Street; $; smoking at outdoor cafe only; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This place (and the other Gabriela's on Amsterdam at 93rd Street) is owned by the same people who own two Carmine's, three Ollie's Noodle Shops, two Docks Oyster Bars and one Virgil's Real BBQ. But unlike those restaurants named after fictional characters, there really is a Gabriela, and she makes terrific, authentic Mexican dishes. Appetizers include nachos, topped with a choice of homemade chorizo, roast chicken, shredded beef, grilled mushrooms, poblano and spinach and tomato avocado; quesadillas; and a crispy tortilla topped with shredded pork. Entrees include rotisserie chicken with a blend of Yucatan spices; crispy tender fried pork, served with Mexican salsa and freshly made corn tortillas; and grilled sirloin steak with cactus, poblano peppers, mushrooms and sweet onions. ($25 and Under: 1/12/00)</p>
        <p>GENNARO  +  (212) 665-5348; 665 Amsterdam Avenue, between 92nd and 93rd Streets; $$; no smoking; cash and personal checks only.</p>
        <p>Gennaro Picone is turning out lusty, full-flavored food in this tiny, simply decorated Italian restaurant. Starters include warm potato and mushroom tart with goat cheese; beef carpaccio with arugula and shaved parmesan cheese; and grilled vegetables with smoked mozzarella. Main dishes include cornish hen roasted with lemon; grilled salmon with honey mustard sauce; and handmade tortellini filled with ricotta and spinach with butter and sage sauce. ($25 and Under: 3/21/97)</p>
        <p>JIN DAL LAE  +  (212) 579-0344; 494 Amsterdam Avenue, at 84th Street; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Every cuisine has its moment in the sun. Now, it appears to be Korea's turn. Starters include steamed tofu marinated with soy sauce; traditional sticky rice cake sauteed in spicy red pepper and garlic sauce; and seaweed salad with scallions and sesame seed. Entrees include grilled marinated prime short ribs served with green-leaf lettuce; fried soft shell crab with mixed vegetables; and sliced squid and vegetables in hot and spicy sauce. ($25 and Under: 1/26/00)</p>
        <p>LA GROLLA  *  [Rating: One Star]  (212) 496-0890; 413 Amsterdam Avenue, between 79th and 80th Streets; $$$; smoking at outdoor cafe only; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The owners of this cheery Italian restaurant have decided to showcase a dozen specialties from the Val d'Aosta region of Italy and to round them out with an assortment of Northern Italian dishes. Appetizers include roasted baby artichokes with almond pesto; pan-fried Fontina cheese over mixed salad; and beef carpaccio with arugula, artichokes and parmigiano. Entrees include homemade potato gnocchi with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella; veal scaloppine with ham and Fontina cheese; and jumbo shrimps wrapped in prosciutto and sauteed in orange sauce. (Review: 6/16/99)</p>
        <p>PAMPA  +  (212) 865-2929; 768 Amsterdam Avenue, between 97th and 98th Streets; $$; smoking in the garden; cash only.</p>
        <p>This Argentine spot stands out for its lean, flavorful steaks. Appetizers include grilled provolone cheese; marinated tongue in a special vinaigrette; and lentil soup. Entrees include Peruvian-style roasted chicken, marinated in lemon and herbs; grilled filet of mignon, wrapped in a slice of bacon; grilled short ribs; grilled shell steak; and breaded veal cutlet and fried eggs. ($25 and Under: 11/12/97)</p>
