        <p>LOWELL LIEBERMANN  Composer  SINCE my own schedule is so unpredictable, I seldom make notes months ahead of time regarding forthcoming concerts. But these events, involving two of my most cherished composers, went into my calendar as soon as they were announced. The absolute no-miss is in January: James Levine conducting the Metropolitan Opera's new production of Busoni's searing ''Doktor Faust,'' a masterpiece. This rarely staged work contains some of the most beautiful and thrilling music I know, and it has my favorite high C in all of opera. Hearing it played by the Met's orchestra is a fantasy I will finally have fulfilled. I also hope to be in town for all of the Met Orchestra's concerts at Carnegie Hall. It's a fabulous lineup, highlighted for me by a December concert conducted by Valery Gergiev that includes Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony. That should blast the roof off Carnegie Hall.</p>

        <p>RENEE FLEMING  Soprano  AT the beginning of each new season, I think how wonderful it would be to spend more time attending performances by friends and colleagues. Occasionally, it is possible to take a busman's holiday, and I love it when I do. Naturally, the Metropolitan Opera is always near and dear to my heart, both as a performer and as an audience member, and this season I'm especially interested in two Met premieres: in addition to James Levine conducting Busoni's ''Doktor Faust'' in January, Valery Gergiev is conducting Prokofiev's ''Gambler'' in March. And let's not forget the concert world, especially the Carnegie Hall recital debut of my friend the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet, who will play a French program in February. Jean-Yves's beautiful sense of line and color are so evident in the works he will be playing, especially Ravel's ''Miroirs,'' Debussy's ''Images'' and Messiaen's ''Regard de l'Eglise d'Amour.'' I also love his sense of surprise and hope he'll play some Duke Ellington as an encore.</p>
        <p>HELENE GRIMAUD  Pianist  FOR a pianist, operas seem like such a complete art form, so I'm always excited when one of my favorites can be seen live. This year, that's happening at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where Janacek's ''Makropulos Case'' is coming in February. The production, from Glyndebourne, is directed by Nikolaus Lehnhoff and stars the soprano Anja Silja. The conductor is David Atherton. There's always so much originality in Janacek's operas, with the folk elements, declamatory motifs and rhythmic drive giving his music its primal vitality. But I'm also very taken with the theme of this opera, that life has more beauty and meaning if it's finite. The other event I'm really looking forward to is Kremerata Baltica's Carnegie Hall debut in October. The group will be playing the music of Peteris Vasks, Vivaldi and Astor Piazzolla. What I like so much about this talented ensemble is that it plays not only with great cohesion but also with tremendous enthusiasm, soul and a sense of adventure.</p>
        <p>DAVID DANIELS  Countertenor  THIS season I'm most interested in hearing the tenor Ian Bostridge in Janacek's ''Diary of One Who Vanished'' at John Jay College in May. The production is a New York premiere, part of Lincoln Center's New Visions series, and the work will be sung in English in a new translation by the poet Seamus Heaney. Thanks to Deborah Warner's controversial staging, it's more a theatrical event than a standard concert, and the song cycle is a great vehicle for Ian, whose clear, honest sound is perfect for this affecting material. I was actually hoping to hear him sing it in Munich this summer, but I had rehearsals. Also, I'm very curious about the bass-baritone Thomas Quasthoff's Schubert and Brahms recital at Alice Tully Hall in March. I know him only through recordings, so I want to be in the front row for that one. Just the other day, a friend played me Mr. Quasthoff singing ''Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,'' downloaded off the Internet. My jaw practically fell into my chicken soup. It was incredible. Vocal bliss. Amazing.</p>
        <p>LEONARD SLATKIN  Conductor  IN an era that has seen the decline of the symphony, it is encouraging that a few of my old friends are embarking on second works in that form. John Corigliano will have a new symphony introduced by the Boston Symphony in November, and Peter Schickele will have his performed by the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra in May. And two composers who seem to be dueling for the right to be the American Hindemith in concerto production will have notable works presented for the first time: Christopher Rouse has a new clarinet concerto for Larry Coombs and the Chicago Symphony in May, and William Bolcolm has created a piece for four saxophones and orchestra that will be performed by the Detroit Symphony in October. Two other works should provoke a bit of controversy. Michael Daugherty will have his ''Motor City Triptych'' performed, also by the Detroit Symphony, in January, and David del Tredici has created a composition titled ''Gay Life'' for the San Francisco Symphony in May. Since it is not always possible for me to attend premieres, I eagerly await copies of the scores. More important, I look forward to the second performances of each of these works.</p>
        <p>ROBERT HURWITZ  President, Nonesuch Records  ONE thing that excites me is that at a lot of institutions there is much more interesting programming going on than there was 5 or 10 years ago. George Steel at the Miller Theater, for example, has come out of nowhere in the last two or three years and done a really great music program covering all genres. Even at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, the overall level of interest in nonstandard programming has been an extremely positive development. Also, the ascension over the last number of years of Michael Tilson Thomas in San Francisco, Simon Rattle, and Esa-Pekka Salonen in Los Angeles, has been a great part of the evolution of the whole scene. I have a certain amount of envy of what Mr. Thomas does in San Francisco each summer with his ''Mavericks'' festival. But at least he comes to New York a couple times a year. This February he's doing a big Stravinsky concert at Carnegie Hall. He's doing ''Agon,''  ''Persephone'' and the ''Symphony of Psalms,'' three pieces that are not heard that often. By complete coincidence, Mr. Salonen is also doing two concerts of Stravinsky in March at Lincoln Center, and there's going to be some late Stravinsky in the London Sinfonietta concerts with Peter Serkin at Carnegie Hall, also in March. At the Czech festival at Lincoln Center in May, the Janacek ''Diary of One Who Vanished'' is the program I'm most keenly interested in. The Schonberg Ensemble is doing a Mauricio Kagel concert with Reinbert de Leeuw at Carnegie Hall in November. That's something I'm probably going to go out and see.</p>
