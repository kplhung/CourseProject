        <p>SOME people have lots of ideas. Writers think of stories. Mathematicians come up with proofs. Financial planners find practical solutions for life's basic problems -- like making sure you don't have to eat cat food in retirement.</p>
        <p>My husband's second cousin, Allan Caan, a financial planner in Fair Lawn, must have a lots of time on his hands because he has more than his share of ideas.</p>
        <p>I see Allan once a year, at a family reunion in the Catskills. One morning at our latest reunion, the conversation turned to golf, and Allan explained how several years ago golf had given him an idea for paring the long lines at New Jersey's vehicle inspection stations.</p>
        <p>''I was driving in the car and it just came to me,'' Allan said. ''Tee times.''</p>
        <p>From Allan's lips to Christie Whitman's ears. The State of New Jersey finally introduced scheduled car inspections this summer.</p>
        <p>But that's kid stuff to Allan Caan. In 1996, Allan came up with his Big Idea: a plan to save Social Security.</p>
        <p>''I tossed the current Social Security System out the window and decided to start from scratch and see what I could come up with,'' Allan said. ''Within a half-hour, I came up with a plan that I actually thought would work.''</p>
        <p>Before you laugh, consider this. Allan's suggestion that I refinance my mortgage a several years ago was so well-timed that I got an interest rate of 6 1/8 percent.</p>
        <p>It would take more space than I have here to do real justice to Allan's plan. But the gist has to do with what economists call the time value of money: the earlier you invest, the less money you have to put in. Allan argued that if we contributed to Social Security when people were born -- instead of waiting until they start working, as is done now --  Social Security taxes could be reduced by 97 percent. For a baby born in 2000, Allan has calculated, it would take a one-time contribution of just $3,552 at birth to generate the same benefit that would require $250,000 of contributions under the current system.</p>
        <p>''We're wasting that first 18 or 22 years of the person's life,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For the past several years, Allan has pushed his plan on anybody and everybody in power: his Congressman, other Congressmen, Jon Corzine's campaign staff. He once approached Christie Whitman at a Devils' game and handed her an outline. This summer, he had lunch at the Forum Diner in Paramus with Linda Mercurio, who is running for Congress in the Fifth District.</p>
        <p>''On its face, it really does make sense,'' said Ms. Mercurio, a law professor and former tax attorney. ''The biggest problem with it is selling it.''</p>
        <p>''Tell me about it,'' Allan said.</p>
        <p>The furthest Allan has gotten was to have a business columnist for The Washington Post write about his idea in 1997. He was also invited to Washington by Representative Sue Kelly, a New York Republican, in 1996 to talk to her staff, but never got past the waiting room. Many people in or near power have claimed to be fascinated by Allan's idea, but so far all it has really generated are polite thank-you notes.</p>
        <p>''The thing is,'' Allan said, ''if you call a congressman with a problem, they know exactly what to do. But if you call them with solution, they're at a loss.''</p>
        <p>I decided to run this by the office of Allan's congressman. Chuck Young, the chief of staff for Representative Steven Rothman, confirmed that constituents' problems outnumber solutions by 3 to 1, but he insisted that the congressman took ''whatever they have to say seriously.''</p>
        <p>''We have him in our computer,'' Mr. Young said</p>
        <p>The thank-you letter, that is.</p>
        <p>But you can't stop a thinker. Allan also has ideas for renewing urban slums without raising taxes and is pondering health reform. I posed some problems myself. What would he do about Lincoln Tunnel traffic? Or the Chicago Cubs?</p>
        <p>''E-ZPass is a great system,'' Allan said with a shrug. ''I didn't come up with that.'' As for the Cubs, he sighed, ''Some things are just impossible.''</p>
        <p>But it seems likelier that the Cubs will win a pennant than that somebody inside the Beltway will seriously consider an idea for saving Social Security from a financial planner in Fair Lawn.</p>
        <p>''The system doesn't completely shut out ideas,'' said Cliff Zukin, chairman of the public policy department at Rutgers. ''But it is closed to people who are not already powerful.''</p>
