        <p>MOVING to Wisconsin after 15 years in Manhattan, my partner, Anne, and I were charmed by the idea of the new way of life Madison would offer. But beyond the state's capital, our knowledge of Wisconsin amounted to a few hours spent on I-90 and a grab bag of cliches about cheeseheads, badgers, blizzards and lakes, mostly frozen ones. We felt apprehensive about living in a landscape without vertical dimension: neither of us is fond of the legato drone of the flat Midwest. So ranking high among the many startling pleasures of our move has been our discovery of the Driftless, Wisconsin's hilly southwest quadrant.</p>
        <p>To the casual eye, the Driftless is more reminiscent of Vermont (with bits of Appalachia thrown in) than Kansas or Nebraska. Its charismatic variety comes courtesy of a quirk of glacial history. When the last great ice bulldozer swept down from Canada 10,000 years ago, it scoured most of Wisconsin flat but spared the western uplands of the state, an area of 7,000 square miles. The result is one of the world's largest pockets of land entirely surrounded by glacial drift. This legacy makes the Driftless a mecca for travelers who enjoy quick-changing vistas: switchback roads, valley mazes and steep limestone river bluffs.</p>
        <p>We knew we couldn't expect to exhaust this rich region on a single visit, so we set out last May with the idea of sampling three rivers -- the Kickapoo, the Wisconsin and the Mississippi -- via four modes of transport: canoe, bike, foot and car. Route 60 west from Madison took us along the banks of the Wisconsin, which offers 92 miles of uninterrupted canoeing: no portages, cascades or dams. But our goals were more modest. At Wauzeka we turned north to follow the smaller Kickapoo through the most ornate valley in Wisconsin. Seventy miles later, in the town of Ontario, we put our faith in Titanic Canoe Rentals.</p>
        <p>The 125-mile Kickapoo is little more than a stream: all of 2 feet deep and 25 feet wide. Except in snow-melt season, it is a slumberous beauty, an ideal river to explore with children, as canoeing down it involves little more than steering with the gentle flow. In Algonquin, Kickapoo means ''he who goes there, then here.'' This is reputedly the most crooked river in America, an infinity of bends. Its circumlocutions are a marvelous way to wean a resistant vacationer of workaholic notions of cutting to the chase. The Kickapoo cuts back on itself at its leisure; it goes nowhere not very fast.</p>
        <p>We took the 4-hour option of the 2- to 12-hour trips offered by Titanic's rental-shuttle service. We canoed past farmlands, water meadows, oak savanna, pockets of goat prairie and hemlock-shaded bluffs. In the early spring, fields of white trillium were spread beneath the trees. Anne spotted a barred owl in broad daylight sitting quietly 10 feet away on a bankside snag.</p>
        <p>That night, we appreciated having a private kitchen at Trillium, an organic 85-acre working farm and bed and breakfast near La Farge. We stayed in one of the guest cottages and made dinner from provisions bought at one of Vernon County's excellent Amish roadside stores. Be warned: the Wisconsin hinterland can be a diner's wilderness. I'd sooner eat squirrel brain than appetizers like cheese curds deep-fried in beer-dipped batter.</p>
        <p>Drinking wine and reading on our Trillium porch to the sound of geese and lambs was a moment of special peace. Toward sundown, a fox, red tongue lolling, loped across the meadow. Next morning, the owner, Rosanne Boyett, arrived with a basket of various warm breads wrapped in tea towels; she bakes something different each day. Following a route she suggested (through Viroqua, Westby and Cashton), we meandered north and then west through back-road bliss toward the Mississippi. Our route took us through red-barned dells crosshatched with trout streams. Small family farms dominate, as the terrain is too irregular for industrial-scale agriculture. So this, too, is part of the region's unglaciated legacy: the Driftless has been spared character assassination by agribusiness.</p>
        <p>Cresting the bluffs near La Crosse, we dipped down to the Mississippi. It would have been worth the visit just to have sat and stared at the vast flow: an epic stretcher for our computer-addled eyes. While in the vicinity of La Crosse we decided to follow a friend's suggestion and cycle the Great River State Trail. It was the best decision of the trip.</p>
        <p>Wisconsin pioneered the national movement to convert abandoned railroad corridors into bicycle trails. The Driftless now boasts 120 miles of connected rails-to-trails, with the 24-mile Great River State Trail the piece de resistance. Instead of renting bikes in the grungy town of Onalaska and cycling north, we started midway at the funky Art Deco Trempealeau Inn in the town of the same name, 17 miles upriver from La Crosse. We then cycled in either direction, first taking in the bluff land of Perrot State Park and the sand prairie and marshes of Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
        <p>That part was spectacular enough, with glorious Mississippi vistas at every turn. But even more impressive -- and wilder -- were the ecologically rich wooded bottomlands, back eddies and sloughs south of Trempealeau. There we encountered armadas of white pelicans, bald eagles, ospreys, several beaver, an otter and an elegant troupe of great egrets fishing.</p>
        <p>The bike trail bisects a sliver of the massive Upper Mississippi River Wildlife and Fish Refuge, a 200,000-acre corridor that spans five states. The trail's elevated rail beds offer rare, intimate access to backwaters that would otherwise remain obscure. From 30 feet up, you see much more than you ever would on slushy, reed-level treks by foot. We followed our easy-paced, four-hour ride of around 18 miles with a two-hour circuit of Trempealeau Bay in canoes rented cheaply in Perrot State Park. We saw less on water than by bike. But it was decent exercise, mostly canoeing against the current.</p>
        <p>By then, we were famished. So we headed north along the Great River Road and chanced upon our best meal of the trip at Currents (''a small cafe on a big river'') in Alma, a small, rambling town squeezed between the river and the bluffs. The strip of river hamlets north of Trempealeau -- Alma, Pepin and Stockholm -- boasts half a dozen fine restaurants. This sudden bounty is doubtless a result of entering the catchment area for Twin City tourists: Minneapolis and St. Paul lie some 70 miles northwest of Stockholm.</p>
        <p>We spent that night in the Harrisburg Inn B &amp; B on the outskirts of Maiden Rock. The inn overlooks Lake Pepin, one of the Mississippi's broadest points. (The ''lake'' is really a 28-mile-long, 3-mile-wide natural waterway formed by the delta where the Chippewa flows into the Mississippi.) Next morning, we flung open our bedroom shutters to the sight of a bald eagle gliding above the pink dawn waters. The inn's breakfast room offers especially fine views of what locals wryly call Wisconsin's ''West Coast.''</p>
        <p>The steep-flanked Mississippi Valley has the effect of concentrating life: barges, trains, automobiles, bikes and migrant birds are all funneled down the same corridor. But this means that if you choose a B &amp; B with a river view, as we did, you're also choosing an intimate chorus of freight trains throughout the night. This didn't bother me too much. The hooting blended into my dreams, seeming less mechanical than ornithological -- a romantic emanation of the night.</p>
        <p>We spent the morning dawdling southward through riverside villages. Stockholm (population 100), a community of artists and antiques dealers, thrives on tourism but has retained its architectural integrity, resisting both chain stores and the temptation to turn overly quaint. It contains two of the area's best restaurants: the Bogus Creek Cafe, where we lunched, and the Star Cafe. At Bogus Creek we enjoyed eating in the cafe's splendid garden, lush with early spring blooms.</p>
        <p>Swedish and German immigrants founded Pepin just south of Stockholm in the 1870's. Once a steamboat boomtown, Pepin has been converted into a marina town. A little tawdry around the edges, it is famous primarily for the Harbor View Cafe, which can be mobbed on summer weekends although reputedly well worth the wait. (We didn't get the chance to try it.) Pepin also is a stop for aficionados of the children's author Laura Ingalls Wilder, born in 1867. A replica cabin marks her birthplace and the local museum displays a superabundance of offbeat Wilder bric-a-brac.</p>
        <p>We decided to stay the night in Pepin, at the area's most lavish B &amp; B, the Harbor Hill Inn. Our heavily themed room was perhaps a little overexquisite; one hesitated to sneeze. But the brunch next morning was grand: chilled apple-walnut soup, followed by a lively salad, fresh croissants, chicken breast with a rosemary-raspberry puree and a mixed berry dessert.</p>
        <p>We spent the middle of the day driving south along the Great River Road, which follows the Mississippi's tucks and turns. The 132-mile trip from Pepin to Prairie du Chien, near the southern edge of the Driftless, took about three hours. Our primary concern was to leave enough daylight to hike the craggy bluffs of Wyalusing State Park, one of Wisconsin's most scenic parks.</p>
        <p>After our day of big brunches and driving, Wyalusing proved exactly what we needed. We parked on Sentinel Ridge and hiked some of the park's 22 miles of twisting trails, which dip down from bluff top through hardwood forests to the river and up again.</p>
        <p>Wyalusing, 10 miles south of Prairie du Chien, offered the finest vistas of the trip. The undammed lower Wisconsin enters the Mississippi here, creating a wild, watery maze that stretches to the horizon. Several bald eagles floated by beneath us; in winter they congregate at Wyalusing by the score.</p>
        <p>The convergence of these two impressive rivers has proved enticing to settlers for thousands of years. Some of the earliest Indian inhabitants built effigy and ceremonial mounds in the shapes of birds, deer, bears and other creatures. We visited 25 mounds that line the ridge: they have retained a peculiar potency. It was here, too, that Louis Joliet and Father Jacques Marquette became, in 1673, the first Europeans to reach the upper Mississippi.</p>
        <p>The vast waters beneath Wyalusing's Sentinel Ridge were turning coppery in the dusk by the time we took off our hiking boots and headed east. We followed the Wisconsin most of the way, passing through Spring Green (where Frank Lloyd Wright built Taliesin) and on to Madison. Along the way we gave thanks for the geological accident, so many millenniums ago, that left the Driftless uneroded. Then we started planning our next foray into its lively and unpredictable topography.</p>
        <p>Navigating through the Driftless</p>
        <p>Pepin, Wis., lies on the edge of a two-and-a-half-mile-wide stretch of the Mississippi known as Lake Pepin, 65 miles southeast of Minneapolis and St. Paul and 200 miles northwest of Madison. Pepin is at the heart of the most spectacular section of the Great River Road (Route 35), which follows the Mississippi.</p>
