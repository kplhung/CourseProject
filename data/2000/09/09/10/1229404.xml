        <p>Steve Ballmer jumped out of a giant birthday cake. And Bill Gates showed off a computer program he wrote in the Basic code language a long, long time ago for a video game (involving a car and a donkey) that seemed, well, more than a bit primitive today.</p>
        <p>''It's very powerful,'' Mr. Gates said to a chorus of guffaws from a crowd of about 15,000 Microsoft employees last week. ''Honestly. This was really cool.''</p>
        <p>The scene was Microsoft's 25th anniversary celebration last Tuesday, and Mr. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, and Mr. Gates (does anyone not know that he was a co-founder of the company?) had rented out Safeco Field, the Seattle ballpark, for a companywide party. It was part retrospective celebration, part pep talk for a company that is both fighting for its survival against antitrust lawyers and embarking on a new strategy that will transform many of its products into Internet-based services.</p>
        <p>But Sinbad, the actor, provided the most comic relief. He drew sustained laughter with his proposals for changing company procedures: ''No more e-mail,'' he urged. ''I mean, get up out of your chair and tell your co-workers what you want. No more being lazy. We could afford to close the company gym if we could get all of you to stop using e-mail.''</p>
