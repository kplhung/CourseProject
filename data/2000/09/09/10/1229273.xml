        <p>Rudy Vollero was doing the Funky Chicken. He was doing it to a Bee Gees soundtrack. He was doing it on the tiny stage of the Moonlight Lounge in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where ''Stayin' Alive'' has been doing just that.</p>
        <p>''Whut?'' he said, offering his palms and bobbing his oily pompadour in front of the mike. His voice was dead-on Travolta from the ''Welcome Back, Kotter'' days. His style could be termed late 70's Disco Stud.</p>

        <p>Rudy Vollero was doing the Funky Chicken. He was doing it to a Bee Gees soundtrack. He was doing it on the tiny stage of the Moonlight Lounge in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where ''Stayin' Alive'' has been doing just that.</p>
        <p>''Whut?'' he said, offering his palms and bobbing his oily pompadour in front of the mike. His voice was dead-on Travolta from the ''Welcome Back, Kotter'' days. His style could be termed late 70's Disco Stud.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, I'm Italian,'' he was telling the crowd, his zip-up sweater revealing some naked chest. ''But I'm intelligent. I am. I mean, I know about the bridge.''</p>
        <p>They say every joke is based on a nugget of fact. If that's the case, then the crowds who gather each week for the Moonlight's local comedy show are regularly pelted with fistfuls of the truth. The audience each Thursday night runs heavy toward youngish Italian-American men. The comics, who clearly have this down, stock their acts with oral sex routines and bits on surviving in the Sal-and-Joey heartland.</p>
        <p>There are Olive Garden jokes. Stallone and Pacino jokes. Jokes about guys named Vinny Baboots. Sometimes, the talent doesn't even make it to the punch line. A well-placed fuhgeddaboutit early in the gag, and the guys at the bar are already chuckling into their bottled beer.</p>
        <p>A comic named Meyer stood up and asked the crowd to clap along as he performed a homemade rap with a certain Italian-American hero as its theme: ''Joseph Buttafuoco is the man/He can get any girl he can/But along came Amy Fisher, and she was good/And she went and got him with her own piece of wood.''</p>
        <p>The Moonlight sits on a busy corner of Fort Hamilton Parkway and 92nd Street and is filled most Thursday nights with good-looking women and their muscular dates. Some of the men, too, would be good-looking if their torsos didn't seem so steroidal atop lower halves that looked as if they'd been shrunk in the wash.</p>
        <p>The lounge, a friendly place with a four-sided bar, a few Formica tables and a bare-bones stage, is in a neighborhood with many Italian-Americans. During the last few years, however, the area has seen a steady wave of Russian immigrants moving in and tensions are running somewhat high.</p>
        <p>It is possible to do a rough comediological study that gauges the disquiet caused by the recent influx. Just plot the number of Russian jokes against their relative nastiness, and a picture of ethnic restlessness begins to appear.</p>
        <p>''So how many Italians we got here tonight?'' a comic was asking. The crowd sent up a rollicking cheer. ''And how about the Irish? We got any Irish in the house?''  Happy shouting, but softer now. ''So how about the Russians? Any Russians here tonight?'' the jokester asked, setting the trap. The room was deathly quiet. ''Well, you know why that is, don'tcha? It's because they don't take food stamps here.''</p>
        <p>Down the block from the bar, Arschile Lipkint, who came to Brooklyn from Moscow a few years back, was buying cigarettes in a local bodega. He thought the food stamp joke was pretty good but hardly a knee slapper.</p>
        <p>''The Italians,'' he said, shaking his head as he lit up. ''These people will laugh at almost anything.''</p>
