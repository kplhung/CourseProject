        <p>In 1952, when city officials adjusted New York's school lunch menu to reflect the growing Puerto Rican population, they went to the experts. They consulted Puerto Rican students, who suggested beans and rice, and they chose a Puerto Rican kitchen employee to cook with ingredients bought in her own neighborhood, just as she would at home.</p>
        <p>Apparently, the first batch packed quite a kick.</p>
        <p>''On checking the quantities used by our culinary expert from Puerto Rico, we found that, for an amount sufficient to serve six, one whole head of garlic was used,'' the superintendent reported. ''From that point on, it was a question of reducing the quantity of garlic and chile to the point where it would be generally acceptable.''</p>
        <p>The superintendent's report is part of an exhibition in the St. George Ferry Terminal by the New York Food Museum. From low-garlic beans to Depression-era farm subsidies to the Reagan-era suggestion that ketchup was a vegetable, the show, which opened on Tuesday, chronicles how school lunches have reflected the country's social and political changes.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of issues in there, stories not told,'' said Nancy Ralph, the director and a founder of the two-year-old museum.</p>
        <p>A 1905 study found that New York City children were widely malnourished, but the United States Department of Agriculture did not begin major school lunch programs until the 1930's.</p>
        <p>At that time, there was a food surplus because of the Depression. Farmers were producing, but people had little money to buy food, Ms. Ralph said.</p>
        <p>''School lunches were considered, at least in part if not more, a farm relief,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Over the years, school lunches changed. Locally grown family farm fare gave way to mass-produced frozen shipments. Meat, once considered too expensive for daily consumption, gradually entered the menu.</p>
        <p>Budget cuts in the early 1980's reduced the program by a third, and in recent years, hamburgers, pizzas and milkshakes replaced beet soup and Creole lima beans.</p>
        <p>In a few places, that trend is reversing itself. Residents of Berkeley, Calif., are pushing schools to install their own gardens and use organically grown food.</p>
        <p>The exhibition, designed by Peter Melville, features 160 orange, red, pink, and gray plastic school lunch trays welded onto aluminum frames. The trays display time lines that give a history of school lunches and photographs of early school cafeterias, as well as tips on promoting healthful eating habits and on reducing the stigma of free lunches.</p>
        <p>The museum, which has no physical headquarters, is not that well known.</p>
        <p>''Everybody thinks it's going to be about old food,'' said Ms. Ralph, who is also a computer consultant.</p>
        <p>''A woman at the Folk Art Museum in L.A. called to ask how to preserve a decorated Slovenian gingerbread exhibit,'' Ms. Ralph said. ''I suggested she call the Culinary Institute.''</p>
