        <p>THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO</p>
        <p>With Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards.</p>
        <p>By Whit Stillman.</p>
        <p>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $24.</p>
        <p>Whether one saw the end of the disco era as a blessing or the waning of Nirvana, the writer and director Whit Stillman's 1998 movie ''The Last Days of Disco'' managed to capture some of the essence of the early 1980's. The question is: do we need a novel, too? Stillman apparently thinks so. He's written a book that expands on the story of two female Hampshire College graduates trying to make their way in the publishing industry and the five Harvard men they meet in New York. The story is narrated by one of those men, Jimmy Steinway, whose main value to his advertising agency seems to be that he can get clients into the Club, a hot disco. Behind the velvet rope and through the sounds of period anthems like ''Le Freak,'' we follow the lives of these characters through various yearnings, pairings and crises. The dialogue will be familiar to anyone who saw the movie. But the self-conscious comparisons with the movie (including a swipe at the movie's critics) are distracting. Who cares if Alice did not greatly resemble Chlo Sevigny, who played her in the movie? Or if Berrie, who owned the Club, was ''less of a hipster'' than he was on film? Stillman's writing is not without insight and wit, but the book seems superfluous. In one scene, Alice moves to the song ''More, More, More'' while downing Pernod. Alas, by the time the balloons and confetti fall for the last time at the Club, some readers may be hearing the refrain of another hit song -- enough is enough'' -- in their heads.</p>
