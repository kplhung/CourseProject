        <p>Rutgers scored almost at will, overcame the few mistakes it made, laid claim to the line of scrimmage and laid siege on the other team's quarterback, and buried Buffalo tonight, 59-0.</p>
        <p>Yes, Rutgers really did these things.</p>
        <p>The asterisk: Buffalo (0-2) has lost 17 games in a row and gave up 63 points last week to Syracuse, which lost today to Cincinnati, 12-10.</p>
        <p>But still. Rutgers, 1-10 a year ago, is 2-0 for the first time in six years. The victory was easily the most lopsided in Terry Shea's five-year coaching tenure, topping the Scarlet Knights' 13-point victory over Villanova last week.</p>
        <p>Rutgers had not won a game by such a large margin, or by a shutout, since Oct. 2, 1993, when it defeated Temple, 62-0.</p>
        <p>''It felt good to see the fans leaving early because we were up by so much,'' said the junior flanker David Stringer, who caught two touchdown passes.</p>
        <p>The Scarlet Knights have momentum and confidence heading into their next game, on the road next Saturday against Virginia Tech and quarterback Michael Vick, a leading Heisman Trophy candidate.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that we have a train waiting for us at the end of the tunnel,'' Shea said.</p>
        <p>That is why staying on a roll was just as important to Rutgers as spending a muggy night running past an overmatched opponent. Shea was pleased that Rutgers played a clean game, and at its pace: fast.</p>
        <p>Asked to assess his team's mood after the game, Shea replied, ''Not giddy. It's very excited about coming back for Game 3. I believe the guys are really looking forward to next week. That's what I sense. And that comes from confidence and success on the field.''</p>
        <p>Mike McMahon, Rutgers's soft-spoken senior quarterback, threw five touchdown passes for the second straight week. He completed 17 of 25 passes for 249 yards in only three quarters of action. He became the first Rutgers quarterback to throw for 10 touchdowns in two games.</p>
        <p>The Scarlet Knights needed no more than 2 minutes 16 seconds to score any of their eight touchdowns. Rutgers accumulated 453 yards and surrendered just 2.6 yards a play. The Scarlet Knights rolled to leads of 17-0 after one quarter and 31-0 after a half, and kept pouring it on.</p>
        <p>''I just wish we would have had this offense three years ago,'' McMahon said. Even better for Shea, who will relish the chance to point out some mistakes in the film sessions, the Scarlet Knights' performance was not flawless. Rutgers could easily have scored more points.</p>
        <p>Rutgers lost a fumble in the end zone on a blooper-reel play, in which the ball was kicked and dribbled downfield. A false-start penalty turned a fourth-and-1 into a field goal. The Knights failed to convert a 32-yard loss by Buffalo on a bad punt snap into any points.</p>
        <p>The players know those kinds of mistakes won't do against Virginia Tech.</p>
        <p>''I've never been on that side here at Rutgers, and that's a great feeling,'' Tom Petro, a senior nose tackle, said. ''We're just going to prepare for Virginia Tech the same way we prepared for this game. We're just going to have to try to have an A-plus game.''</p>
