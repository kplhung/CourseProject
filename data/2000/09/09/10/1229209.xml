        <p>VISUAL art has long been considered to be a window to the artist's soul. Art therapists use the pictures that their clients create to open a dialogue, hoping to clarify the root of their pain.</p>
        <p>Ker Berdimurat-Beckley, an art therapist who has been working primarily with emotionally injured children for the last 10 years, talked about her work recently during an interview at Four Winds Hospital here in Cross River.</p>
        <p>Q. In making your assessment, do you get most of your information from the artwork and some information from the child's guardian?</p>
        <p>A. I make my own assessment. Then I work with a treatment team; a psychologist, psychiatrist, social workers and nurses, and we all offer into a discussion our observations to build an individual treatment plan.</p>
        <p>Q. How do your patients end up here?</p>
        <p>A. When children come into a hospital, it's usually a last resort. They could be suicidal. They could be psychotic, sometimes self-destructive. Sometimes, they are ill as a result of their stressful or traumatic environment. Referrals come through hospital emergency rooms, schools, other agencies, residency treatment centers, other mental health professionals, families, neighbors, etc. In the case of an abused child, it is almost never the abuser that brings them in.</p>
        <p>Q. What are you looking for in their art?</p>
        <p>A. It's a combination of things. I look at the organization and the expression -- or lack of expression in the art. I look at the impulse control or behavior. That could be someone who starts with painting, and then they get overwhelmed and the paint goes all over the place. I hear the 'I can't' mode, 'I can't do this.' Then, I try to find an intervention that they can engage in, in order to find some success. Art therapists see the art that their patients produce as a tool to further a dialogue. Sometimes, their art is the only opportunity we have to reach them, and to get to their healthy side.</p>
        <p>Q. Children attend horror movies. They might be inclined to express what they see in a particular movie and not what they are actually feeling. How do you distinguish between a boy's normal fascination with violence and an abnormal expression of emotions?</p>
        <p>A. The distinction is made when you become aware of their home life. How do they socialize? Are they isolating? When you see that bloody mask that they've just painted, that's a red flag. Then, I try to find out what is going on inside. I assume that there is some internal struggle and that they're not able to express it verbally. It's just a little bit of information that leads to a more in-depth investigation.</p>
        <p>Q. In one of your clients' drawings, there are two figures, one in total shadow and one facing forward with the eyes shaded over. What does that tell you?</p>
        <p>A. This is a self-initiated drawing. That means that he took charcoal and paper and just started drawing. It's interesting that he said to me when he finished the drawing that I'm the one on the right (the figure with the covered eyes), I have hope, I am going to be a basketball player. My friend (the shadowy figure) doesn't understand, so he is leaving. If you look closely at the drawing, you begin to notice the ominous grin -- the hidden hands -- and you ask yourself, Is he holding something? His body is cut off at the legs, indicating a lack of mobility. The covered eyes can be seen as denial -- not wanting to be seen. He's also drawn himself as a stocky, older, muscular white male when he is, in fact, a tall and slender 10-year-old African-American, which can also be seen as a form of denial. I also see the shadowy figure as his dark side; he's not facing us, he's hidden.</p>
        <p>Q.  The painting of the girl and the floating, blacked-out diamond -- can you tell me a little more about that client?</p>
        <p>A. That little girl, who has painted herself nude, lost her twin sister. She was killed by her drug-addicted mother. Her nudity is an indication of her lack of defenses.</p>
        <p>Q. Your patients can't stay here forever. What happens when they leave?</p>
        <p>A. We have an excellent discharge-planning program, and we make sure that, when they leave, they are surrounded by people who will help and support them. With managed health care the way it is, sometimes the money runs out before they are ready to leave. If we believe they are not ready, then we give them free care until they are. We do not want them going back to an unsafe environment.</p>
        <p>The exhibition, ''The Art of Children With Special Emotional Needs,'' will be held at the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts. Quotations from the children and a clinical art therapist's assessment will accompany the art.</p>
        <p>The show opens on Sept. 15 with a reception from 6:30 to 8 p.m. More information about the exhibition can be obtained by calling the center at (914) 241-6922.</p>
