        <p>FOR decades, downtown Riverhead more closely resembled a ghost town than a bustling business center. Now, with new attractions and the restoration of some older buildings, people are returning, commerce is reviving and residents are hoping that their town will no longer be one of the most run-down places on Long Island.</p>
        <p>The renewal was jump-started on June 15, when Atlantis Marine World, a 42,000-square-foot aquarium, opened its doors. Since then, it has averaged 3,000 visitors a day, said Karen Whiteman, a spokeswoman for the aquarium.</p>

        <p>FOR decades, downtown Riverhead more closely resembled a ghost town than a bustling business center. Now, with new attractions and the restoration of some older buildings, people are returning, commerce is reviving and residents are hoping that their town will no longer be one of the most run-down places on Long Island.</p>
        <p>The renewal was jump-started on June 15, when Atlantis Marine World, a 42,000-square-foot aquarium, opened its doors. Since then, it has averaged 3,000 visitors a day, said Karen Whiteman, a spokeswoman for the aquarium.</p>
        <p>Other attractions are coming. The Vision Theater, opening this month on East Main Street, will feature dramas and musicals. The Long Island ScienCenter, focusing on interactive learning and technologies advanced or developed on Long Island, is scheduled to open by year's end.</p>
        <p>Nearby is the 800-seat Suffolk Theater. Built in 1933, the Art Deco building has been closed since 1987, but town officials are working on plans to renovate and possibly reopen it late next year. Suffolk County is negotiating for the addition of 8 courtrooms to the 20-courtroom State Supreme Court complex here.</p>
        <p>Ancillary businesses -- restaurants, ice cream shops and boutiques -- are sprouting up. The renovated J. J. Sullivan Hotel, with 14 rooms and a restaurant, is scheduled to open this month. The restaurant is called Tweed's in memory of the hotel's early years as a watering hole for Tammany Hall politicians. (The original building was erected in 1896, too late to be visited by the notorious William Marcy Tweed, who died in 1878.)</p>
        <p>Richard Madden of Shirley, who took his 18-month-old nephew to the aquarium over the Labor Day weekend, said he noticed the changes. ''I was here years ago, and it didn't look good,'' he said. ''Now there's such a difference. It's like a plant that's sprouted.''</p>
        <p>Tracy Minnella of Blue Point agreed that the downtown area had made a turnaround. ''It's safer and more appealing to tourists,'' she said. ''I don't think I would have wanted to walk around here a few years ago. The atmosphere seems relaxed and comforting now.''</p>
        <p>With the realization of Riverhead's plans come concerns that the makeover is too much too soon, and that the new prosperity will be offset by traffic congestion.</p>
        <p>''People here have been hoping, praying and imagining for years that this would happen,'' said Edwin Tuccio, a local real estate agent and owner of the Sullivan Hotel. ''It's like someone who always wanted to get married and then all of a sudden, they're at the altar and they think to themselves, 'Oh, my God, what have I done?' ''</p>
        <p>Some merchants noted a parking scarcity after Atlantis opened, but the town has opened a new parking area and is considering other measures to alleviate the congestion. ''As soon as Atlantis opened, the streets were packed,'' said Gary Di Gregorio, general manager of the Sears store a block and a half from the aquarium. ''People were parking everywhere.'' He said Sears eventually installed signs reserving a section of its parking lot for the exclusive use of Sears patrons. But, he said, ''the problem seems to have worked itself out to some degree.''</p>
        <p>He concluded that Atlantis and other proposed attractions were good for Riverhead. ''There seems to be a lot more being done now as far as cleaning up the streets and dressing the place up a bit,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Di Gregorio pointed out that other towns underwent business development that initially seemed overwhelming, but later proved beneficial. When the Port Jefferson ferry began upgrading its service to Connecticut in 1982, he said, people worried about traffic. ''But now businesses are booming and people enjoy the income,'' he said. ''They realize it's good for the area.''</p>
        <p>Alan Fabricatore, owner of the Village Delicatessen a few doors from the aquarium, agreed that Riverhead's day-to-day business was disrupted, at first. ''Many of the merchants, like myself, have our regular customers who we depend upon,'' he said. ''These customers lost quite a bit of their everyday routine parking, and so this has definitely been an adjustment for the town. I'd say Riverhead underwent growing pains. But it definitely is easing up. I see a lot of familiar faces coming back.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fabricatore said he hoped that Riverhead would eventually become the tourism capital of eastern Long Island. ''I see tremendous potential,'' he said. ''We're at the entrance to the North and South Forks.''</p>
        <p>The Riverhead police chief, Joseph Gratton, said attractions like Atlantis brought in a desirable, family-oriented clientele.</p>
        <p>Augusta Field, coordinator of Riverhead Vision 20/20, a civic group, said: ''This is a wonderful community with such an authenticity about it. To me, it's like a Midwestern town with the Art Deco buildings and a river running through it.''</p>
        <p>She added that the new businesses  would also draw people who visit the Tanger Outlet Center, a major attraction for shoppers on Route 58, a couple of miles west of downtown. ''They come to Tanger to shop,'' she said, ''but then they want to find good restaurants, and we have two new ones opening up downtown.''</p>
        <p>Richard Hanley, the town planning director, said that in early 1999, the Town Board decided that Riverhead needed to ''reorient itself from a center which essentially purveys goods and services to more of a tourist attraction area,'' and hired a consulting firm, Abeles, Phillips, Preiss &amp; Shapiro, to revise the town's master plan.</p>
        <p>''What really destroyed downtown Riverhead,'' Mr. Hanley said, ''was not retail development on Route 58, but strip shopping centers with grocery stores, pizza parlors and the like. Those are the things that kill downtowns, and it's happened everywhere on Long Island.</p>
        <p>''Every downtown that has succeeded in combating that has reoriented itself in terms of what it does,'' he continued. ''Places like Sayville, Northport and Greenport don't just deliver goods and services to the local population any more. That's what makes towns successful, and that's what we're trying to do in Riverhead.''</p>
