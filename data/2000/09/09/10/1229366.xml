        <p>IF investors followed the advice of Warren Buffett and bought stocks only in businesses they understood, the market capitalization of companies that provide health insurance would probably be anemic.</p>
        <p>Maybe it is because there are so many abbreviations. And jargon. H.M.O., P.P.O., co-pay.</p>
        <p>More likely, it is because the $1.2 trillion health care business is dealing with so many of us that things cannot help but be complicated.</p>
        <p>For much of the 1990's, health maintenance organizations were viewed as a way to combat complexity and keep medical costs under control. No longer. Health insurance premiums are rising, and big corporate clients are turning away from managed-care plans.</p>
        <p>James A. Lane, health benefit analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, took some time last week to discuss recent changes and trends in the business. Following are excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>Q. Health insurance stocks over the last year have certainly been good investments. Would you review the recent record?</p>
        <p>A. Financial results since the beginning of 1999 have been very strong, but before that there were three years of erratic performance. That erratic performance probably ended with Humana's significantly disappointing 1999 results. Those followed a $900 million charge taken by UnitedHealth Group in August 1998, and that followed Oxford Health's implosion in 1997.</p>
        <p>Another reason the sector may be viewed as a tough area is that even with good financial results, over the last year there have been more than 30 class action lawsuits filed against these companies. Those cases are in various stages of litigation.</p>
        <p>Despite that, an index of the 12 stocks we follow is up about 35 percent so far this year.</p>
        <p>Q. After a number of years when costs were under control, health insurance premiums are again rising at double-digit rates. Aside from higher drug costs, what is driving up prices?</p>
        <p>A. Outside of Medicare or Medicaid, underlying cost trends are accelerating for several reasons.</p>
        <p>First, as a result of the Balanced Budget Act, which reduced Medicare hospital reimbursements, hospitals are getting less money from the government. They had to get the money from someone.</p>
        <p>Also, the expanding definition of disease is driving up costs. Employees are demanding coverage for more things today. Products that once were considered lifestyle drugs are now mandated as having to be covered.</p>
        <p>A lot of state governments have put through mandated benefits, like mandatory 48-hour hospital stays for vaginal births, and 72-hour stays for Caesarean births. Those are important to have, but they are inflationary.</p>
        <p>Finally, litigation, which in some cases is warranted, is inflationary.</p>
        <p>Q. Many big companies are reacting to premium increases by turning away from H.M.O.'s and toward their own self-funded plans. Will that trend continue?</p>
        <p>A. We believe there is a secular trend of employer groups contracting with fewer and fewer vendors for all human resource functions, from health insurance to payroll, workers' compensation and disability. And we strongly believe that on the health insurance side there will be a convergence over the next five years of those players.</p>
        <p>Q. Which companies do you like as long-term investments?</p>
        <p>A. Cigna is the company we think is best positioned to take advantage of employer groups dealing with fewer health benefit vendors. It is trading at around $95 now. A year from now we think it will be a $130 to $135 stock.</p>
        <p>UnitedHealth Group, which has had outstanding financial results the last several quarters, is well positioned for the same secular trend. However, a lot of the good news is priced into the stock.</p>
        <p>And our top pick for the year was First Health Group, a midcap stock which is virtually unknown but has great operating margins and a blue-chip client base.</p>
        <p>Q. We haven't talked about Aetna, the country's biggest health insurance company. Last week, the company chose Dr. John W. Rowe, chief executive of Mount Sinai N.Y.U. Medical Center and Health System, to run Aetna. Can a hospital administrator be expected to turn around a business?</p>
        <p>A. Jack Rowe is a national health care figure, which Aetna needs because it is a national whipping boy.</p>
        <p>But one person didn't create the problems that Aetna has, and one person isn't going to solve them. His success or failure at Aetna will be based on his ability to attract more talented people to the Aetna organization and blend them in with those who stay.</p>
        <p>Aetna has a lot of upside potential, but this is going to be a two-year workout period. We suggest investors hold off until there is more clarity.</p>
