        <p>Sotheby's has one more chance to fix its noisy air-conditioning system, or the city will block the unit's power, officials said last week after issuing a fourth violation against the auction house.</p>
        <p>But executives at Sotheby's, at First Avenue and East 76th Street, said they had been working to fix the problem since it was brought to their attention last year. The noise, measured on Thursday, was about six  decibels above the legal limit, which varies with the level of ambient noise in an area.</p>
        <p>Radie and Leonard Nedlin, who live behind Sotheby's on East 77th Street, began complaining to Sotheby's and the city's Department of Environmental Protection about a continuous loud noise from the cooling system, soon after moving into their garden apartment last fall.</p>
        <p>''You hear a hum all the time,'' Ms. Nedlin said. ''Use of the outside, which was a major factor in buying the apartment, has sort of been negated now.''</p>
        <p>In November, inspectors measured the noise inside the couple's apartment at 65 decibels with the system running, compared with 58 decibels with it off. Sotheby's officials appeared before the Environmental Control Board in December and paid a $560 fine.</p>
        <p>But the noise didn't stop. Inspectors returned in January and May, both times issuing noise violations.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's failed to appear at the board in those cases, said Charles G. Sturcken, spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection. He said the auction house currently owes $2,060 in fines.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, a fourth violation was issued. ''We have sufficient violations on the record, and nothing has been done about them,'' Mr. Sturcken said. ''It appears they modified it somewhat, but they're still violating the noise code.'' He said Sotheby's had until its next hearing, on Sept. 20, to show that it will reduce the noise. Failing that, the city could shut down the equipment.</p>
        <p>But Matthew Weigman, a spokesman for Sotheby's, said it had changed fan belts and lined ducts to reduce noise. ''Now, we're installing variable-speed pulleys on the motors to slow down the system,'' he said. ''We expect to be at code by Wednesday.''</p>
