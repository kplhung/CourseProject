        <p>IMAGINE driving at night when a truck comes barreling up from behind you, temporarily blinding you with its bright lights.</p>
        <p>To deal with that annoyance -- and the safety hazard -- the Gentex Corporation of Zeeland, Mich., offers the Night Vision Safety mirror, which dims automatically to cut the glare.</p>
        <p>''It darkens as if by magic,'' said Fred Bauer, the founder, chairman and chief executive of Gentex. ''It starts to dim immediately, and within a second it's substantially darkened.''</p>
        <p>The ''magic'' is electrochromic technology. A chemical gel is sandwiched between two pieces of glass -- one that has been treated with an electrically conductive coating and one with a reflector. When a sensor in the mirror detects a bright light, it sends voltage to the gel in proportion to the amount of glare, and the mirror darkens as much as needed.</p>
        <p>The technology, though developed by Gentex in 1987, has gained popularity in a wide range of cars in recent years. The mirrors are now offered as standard or optional equipment on more than 120 different 2000 models. They are also available in auto parts stores for as little as $65.</p>
        <p>The company, however, sees the mirrors as a starting point for more technologies. More expensive versions of its mirrors offer extras including map lights, digital compasses and outside-temperature displays. But Gentex is going even more high-tech, with ideas for turning the rearview mirror into a portal for all wireless, Internet and navigational tools needed while driving. Mirrors may also gain electronic eyes to detect fog or rain and to turn on windshield wipers automatically.</p>
        <p>When the first mirrors were being tested, Mr. Bauer recalled, ''I probably devoured no less than 50 pizzas driving around late at night and watching to see if my mirror would change.''</p>
        <p>While safety is the No. 1 goal of the mirror, Mr. Bauer said, there is also the comfort factor. ''If you've been in a car that has it, and you switch to a car that doesn't, it's really, really irritating,'' he said.</p>
