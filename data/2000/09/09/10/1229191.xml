        <p>HOMEOWNERS who want to cut their heating costs usually have several options; they can make sure all windows remain closed when the heat is on; they can set the thermostat to whatever temperature they want, day or night; they can avoid heating unused rooms by selectively shutting off radiators or heat registers; and they can make sweaters and thick socks mandatory attire for occupants during the winter months.</p>
        <p>Owners and managers of multifamily buildings, on the other hand, cannot avail themselves of such strategies because most states have minimum temperature requirements that apply to every room in every apartment in a building regardless of how individual tenants might chose to dress.</p>
        <p>There are, however, a number of ways that multifamily building owners can reduce their heating bills -- sometimes significantly. A small but noticeable savings may be obtained, for example, by ensuring that the nozzle on the heating system's burner, a $5 part, is the one recommended by the manufacturer. And savings of as much as 30 percent can be obtained by installing computer-controlled temperature-sensing equipment on the furnace and at strategic locations in the building.</p>
        <p>''One of the first signs of cold weather in most New York City apartments is that it gets too hot in the apartment,'' said Richard Cherry, president of Community Environmental Center, a not-for-profit environmental services organization based in Long Island City. ''That is because superintendents will usually pile on the heat in their buildings to avoid complaints from tenants.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Cherry said, since the heating system in most multifamily buildings is controlled by a heat-timer -- which turns the system on and off for preset periods of time -- the most common strategy superintendents use to determine whether there is sufficient heat in the building is to keep the furnace running until no one complains. That, however, often results in a huge waste of fuel oil.</p>
        <p>''I would say that the average daytime temperature in most apartment buildings is between 78 and 80 degrees,'' he said. ''And as excusable as this may have been when heating oil was 30 cents a gallon, at $1 or more a gallon it's almost criminal.''</p>
        <p>One way to avoid overheating a multiunit building, Mr. Cherry said, is to install Community Environmental Center's Total Energy Management System. The system, he said, uses a control unit in the boiler room to receive a constant stream of information from sensors installed on the boiler or furnace itself and throughout the building.</p>
        <p>The information provided by the sensors is analyzed by the control unit, which then determines the heating needs and the optimum time to run the furnace or boiler.</p>
        <p>''It's very similar to having a thermostatically controlled building,'' he said, adding that information about the heating system -- as well as reports of existing trouble or potential malfunctions -- can be sent to superintendents and off-site managers through a dial-up connection and computer.</p>
        <p>The cost of the Total Energy Management System, which includes a comprehensive buildingwide heating-system analysis, would range between $17,000 and $22,000 for most buildings, depending on the size, Mr. Cherry said. ''We offer a money-back guarantee if a building owner doesn't see a 10 percent reduction in fuel costs over the previous year,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A less expensive heating system add-on that comes with a similar money-back guarantee is MicroTherm, a product manufactured in Manchester, N.H.</p>
        <p>Philip Cocke, a Manhattan-based agent for the SNS Energy Distribution Corporation, a company in Amityville, N.Y., that sells the product in the United States, explained that MicroTherm is a ''microprocessor in a box'' connected to the timing device that controls the on-off cycle of the boiler or furnace. Using a sensor that detects the temperature of water returning to the furnace after it has made its way through radiators in the building, the MicroTherm determines the optimum on-off cycle. ''It acts as the gatekeeper for the burner control circuit,'' Mr. Cocke said, explaining that rather than allow the furnace or boiler to cycle on and off solely in accordance with a preset time schedule, the MicroTherm will either delay the start of a cycle or extend a cycle in progress, based upon the temperature of the water returning to the boiler.</p>
        <p>''It's guaranteed to reduce your fuel consumption by 10 percent,'' Mr. Cocke said, adding that the installed cost of the MicroTherm system in most buildings would be $3,250.</p>
        <p>Another high-tech way to monitor the efficiency of the heating system in larger buildings is through the use of stand-alone sensors that can be placed in apartments and common areas throughout the building.</p>
        <p>Jeremy Baker, senior consultant for building automation of Advanced Digital Internet, a Manhattan company, said his company is now marketing a heating fuel efficiency system that uses wireless digital thermometers installed at strategic locations in a building to send signals to an on-site computer, which then transmits the information over telephone lines to a Web site.</p>
        <p>''The information is then presented in a graphical format on our Web site,'' Mr. Baker said, explaining that the information can be used by a building's management to determine what areas of the building are receiving too much or too little heat and then remedy the situation. He said Advanced Digital Internet -- which is also an Internet service provider -- charges about $100 for each remote thermometer and as little as $600 for the reporting device.</p>
        <p>Henry Gifford, president of Gifford Fuel Savings Inc., a Manhattan-based heating contractor, said he uses what he calls ''a double-hung windowstat'' to determine whether a building is wasting fuel by being unnecessarily overheated.</p>
        <p>''I stand in front of the building in the winter and see if there are any open windows,'' Mr. Gifford said, explaining that in many buildings, the amount of heat being supplied to the building is the direct result of ''one cold tenant yelling for heat.''</p>
        <p>Accordingly, Mr. Gifford said, cold apartments should be inspected to determine whether there are any defective vents on steam radiators, improperly installed radiators or radiators that have been turned off or blocked by furniture or shelving. If there are no obvious problems, he said, management might want to consider installing larger radiators in the cold apartments.</p>
        <p>It is also possible -- with some heating systems -- to install thermostats on individual radiators in each apartment. ''I've done this in a couple of 12-story buildings, and the people are happy as clams,'' he said, adding that because of the way heating systems work, thermostats can be efficiently used only on hot-water heating systems and on ''two pipe'' steam systems that have separate pipes for steam supply and return.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Gifford said, a building owner can ensure that his heating plant is functioning as efficiently as possible for an investment of as little as $5. ''That's how much a nozzle costs for most burners,'' he said, referring to the part of the burner that regulates combustion. ''And I have almost never seen the correct nozzle on an old burner.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gifford explained that while a burner will operate with a nozzle that is a ''close fit,'' it will not operate at its peak efficiency. Accordingly, he said, it is wise for building owners to determine the correct nozzle for their heating system -- something that can be done by calling the system manufacturer and providing the model number of the system -- and then insisting that any service contractor use the proper nozzle.</p>
