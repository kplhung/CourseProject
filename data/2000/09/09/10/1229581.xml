        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The review of ''A Rum Affair'' (Aug. 13) states that this book is about ''Prof. John Heslop Harrison of the Royal Society,'' but fails to mention that there were two British botanists by that name, both fellows of the Royal Society, the subject of the book being the father of the other. John Heslop Harrison the son was a fine botanist of considerable prestige and of impeccable integrity. It should be made clear that this book describes his father's questionable antics rather than his own.</p>
