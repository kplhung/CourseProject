        <p>SHE was, in the words of the abolitionist and novelist Catharine Sedgwick, ''steeped to the very lips in genius.'' Such encomiums, themselves steeped in a 19th-century flavor, accompanied Frances Anne Kemble, known always as Fanny, throughout her long and active life. Born in 1809, she died in 1893, bridging every decade of the century and seemingly every opportunity open to a woman of her time. A star on the London stage, mistress of a Georgia plantation, friend to every important American writer from Washington Irving to Henry James, playwright, poet, novelist, memoirist, Kemble is best remembered today for her ''Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation,'' the first eyewitness account to condemn slavery as institutionalized concubinage. ''Her life reflected quixotic and absorbing dramas,'' struggles ''between blacks and whites, Northerners and Southerners, husbands and wives, parents and children,'' Catherine Clinton writes in ''Fanny Kemble's Civil Wars.'' Clinton, a historian at Baruch College, is also the editor of ''Fanny Kemble's Journals,'' a one-volume selection from Kemble's 11 published volumes of memoirs. Read together, the biography and journals tell a remarkable story, the journals supplying color and atmosphere and Kemble's distinctive voice, the biography clarifying the domestic turmoil that shadowed each stage of their publication -- the ''civil wars'' of Clinton's title.</p>
        <p>Born during the ''Kemble era'' to Britain's most celebrated theater family, niece of John Philip Kemble and Sarah Siddons and daughter of the Shakespearean actor and theater manager Charles Kemble, Fanny, at the age of 19, played Juliet at Covent Garden in a debut that was the talk of London. In 1832, after three years on the British stage, she and her father left to tour ''that dreadful America,'' hoping to pay off family debts. The 30-day voyage was the first of the 18 trans-Atlantic crossings Kemble made in her lifetime.</p>
        <p>Aboard ship she wrote her second play and plotted a third, practiced German by translating verse, read Dante and Byron, and was commended widely for her lively company. Her journal, begun when she was 18 and kept regularly into her 70's, records her sharp observations of roads and accommodations and social behavior in the young American democracy; of tobacco chewers and scalpers who smeared their coats with molasses to clear a path through well-dressed people on the ticket lines; of meeting President Andrew Jackson and hearing of a White House ''levee,'' where women were hoisted onto a mantelpiece to get a better view. Published three years after her arrival in America, when Kemble was retired from the stage and married to Pierce Butler, heir to one of Georgia's largest rice and cotton plantations, ''Journal of America'' was an immediate commercial success and widely rebuked for its ''saucy assessments,'' its ''rough language'' and ''acerbic sketches.'' ''She has been as much talked about as a comet!'' one New York paper declared in 1836.</p>
        <p>''Journal of America,'' contracted for before her marriage, was published in 1835 over the strenuous objections of Butler, who suspected rightly that it would embarrass him and his family. The couple's endless wrangling over passages marked the first disharmony in this memorably disharmonious union.</p>
        <p>''Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation,'' describing Kemble's five-month stay on Butler Island in the Georgia Sea Islands, circulated for years in abolitionist circles, but was not published until 1863, 14 years after she and Butler had divorced. It first appeared in Britain, where it helped sway public opinion against an alliance with the Confederacy. Kemble used initials and dashes instead of names, but her blunt indictment of racial hypocrisy and sexual exploitation was still raising a fuss in Georgia in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>''Records of Later Life,'' covering the years of her troubled marriage, her separation from Butler and their two daughters and return to the London stage, and her eventual divorce, was not published until 1881, 14 years after Butler's death, and led to a break between Kemble and her younger daughter, Fan. Sarah, the older sister, was a staunch Unionist and abolitionist, but Fan had sided with her father after the divorce and during the Civil War. In 1883 Fan published her own book, ''Ten Years on a Georgian Plantation Since the War,'' describing her failed attempt to make the Sea Islands plantation profitable after her father's death.</p>
        <p>Pierce Butler, who one contemporary said had ''an unfortunate propensity for attempting to manage business,'' is an interesting character himself, as strong-willed and determined as Fanny. Their marriage was a 19th-century classic: the abolitionist and the slaveholder. Butler, in his privately printed ''Mr. Butler's Statement,'' put the blame for the breakup of his marriage on his wife's ''peculiar'' views: ''She held that marriage should be companionship on equal terms -- partnership, in which, if both partners agree, it is well; but if they do not, neither is bound to yield.''</p>
        <p>Surely there is plenty here that a contemporary biographer could comment on -- for instance while separated, under the legal rule of feme covert, Kemble owed all her earnings and accumulated assets to her improvident husband; once divorced, she was deprived all contact with her two daughters until they turned 21. But with a life this full, this rich, this prolific, the biographer's first duty, like the editor's, is compression.</p>
        <p>''Yes, I think I actually could be content to sit on that fountain's edge, and do nothing but listen and look for a whole summer's afternoon,'' Kemble wrote on a trip to Rome shortly after leaving her husband and children in America in 1845, ''But no more -- up and be doing,' is the impulse for ever with me.''</p>
        <p>In her 60's she began writing on a typewriter, making her one of the first to employ the machine for personal use. She climbed the Alps until her late 70's. At 80 she published her first novel. Henry James, whom she met and befriended early in his career, in 1873, and to whom she gave the plot for ''Washington Square,'' celebrated her ''luxurious habit'' of writing just as she talked. The voice that ''reanimated the old drawing rooms, relighted the old lamps, retuned the old pianos,'' is captured again in these two fine books.</p>
