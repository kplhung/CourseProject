        <p>THE polite disagreement over the proper place of religion in politics summons us once again to the works of those ever-useful observers of American life, Alexis de Tocqueville of France and James Bryce of Britain. Both of their classic studies, Tocqueville's ''Democracy in America'' (1835) and Bryce's ''The American Commonwealth'' (1888) attend the matter in a spirit that should elicit an amen from Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who has stirred the issue anew with his avowal that religious faith supports a moral foundation for public policy.</p>
        <p>The America that the two well-disposed European visitors described more than a century ago was not quite the idyll of diversity celebrated today by politicians on all sides. When Tocqueville reported that the first thing that struck him on his arrival in the United States was the religious atmosphere, he was referring strictly to Christianity. This practicing Catholic made a debatable case that Catholic immigrants were bringing their own democratic spirit to the religious constellation, concluding -- as some on the Christian Right still do -- that for Americans ''the ideas of Christianity and liberty are so completely mingled that it is almost impossible to get them to conceive of the one without the other.''</p>

        <p>THE polite disagreement over the proper place of religion in politics summons us once again to the works of those ever-useful observers of American life, Alexis de Tocqueville of France and James Bryce of Britain. Both of their classic studies, Tocqueville's ''Democracy in America'' (1835) and Bryce's ''The American Commonwealth'' (1888) attend the matter in a spirit that should elicit an amen from Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who has stirred the issue anew with his avowal that religious faith supports a moral foundation for public policy.</p>
        <p>The America that the two well-disposed European visitors described more than a century ago was not quite the idyll of diversity celebrated today by politicians on all sides. When Tocqueville reported that the first thing that struck him on his arrival in the United States was the religious atmosphere, he was referring strictly to Christianity. This practicing Catholic made a debatable case that Catholic immigrants were bringing their own democratic spirit to the religious constellation, concluding -- as some on the Christian Right still do -- that for Americans ''the ideas of Christianity and liberty are so completely mingled that it is almost impossible to get them to conceive of the one without the other.''</p>
        <p>Bryce took pains to sort out the differences among mainstream Protestant denominations, yet emphasized their basic similarity of beliefs and manners, which he found to be by and large inimitably American. Although the prospect of a Jewish vice president (or a Catholic president) did not figure largely in 19th-century calculations, with just a little adjustment the visitors' religious inclinations would have had less difficulty in accommodating those of an observant Jew than those of a cracker-barrel atheist. Today, Mr. Lieberman, who has run into criticism from the nondenominational Anti-Defamation League, finds himself praised by Christian believers.</p>
        <p>Admiring though both men were of the course of American democracy, they had their misgivings about unfettered freedom. Both evinced a concern that the young nation's cherished political liberty, with its tendencies toward license or excessive individualism or just plain moral indifference, required some constraints, some protection of values different from and perhaps higher than those that seemed to generate a vigorous democracy.</p>
        <p>Consider Bryce's eloquent admonition: ''All that need be here said is that a people with comparatively little around it in the way of historic memories and associations to touch its emotion, a people whose energy is chiefly absorbed in commerce and the development of the material resources of its territory, a people consumed by a feverish activity that gives little opportunity for reflection or for the contemplation of nature, seems most of all to need to have its horizon widened, its sense of awe and mystery touched, by whatever calls it away from the busy world of sight and sound into the stillness of faith and meditation.''</p>
        <p>Tocqueville had already made the point a half century earlier when he asked how a society could escape destruction if, when political ties are relaxed by the give and get of democracy, moral ties are not strengthened. As he put it, what could be done with a people that is master of itself if it is not subject to God? This good believer cautioned that ''while the law allows the American people to do everything, there are things which religion prevents them from imagining and forbids them to dare.'' On that account, he praised American-style religion, which he credited with never intervening directly in the government, as being ''the first of the nation's political institutions.''</p>
        <p>Tocqueville discerned a shakiness in the nature of American democracy, with its constant change of leaders and legislators and its openness to political innovation, which demanded the placement of religion beyond the reach of ''the ebb and flow of human opinions.'' He treasured religion for its conservative aspects, standing as it does above mundane secular struggles, and his forceful warning against an inclination of some believers to ally themselves with political power might these days be called into service by the American Civil Liberties Union. But his concern was as much for the well-being of religion as for the freedom of the state. Religion, he preached, does not need the secular power to live, but in serving that power, it may die.</p>
        <p>So Tocqueville and Bryce, reverent democrats, took their stand both as defenders of religion against the vagaries of the mob and as defenders of freedom against the presumptions of the clergy. In answer to the question of whether the citizenry would able, without a moral code, to ''hold in check the violence of masses and the self-indulgent impulses of the individual,'' Bryce directed his readers to history, where he found support for what seems to be Mr. Lieberman's discovery too, that ''hitherto civilized society has rested on religion, and that free government has prospered best among religious peoples.''</p>
