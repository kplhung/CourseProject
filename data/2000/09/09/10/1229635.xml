      <abstract>
        <p>Miles Arnone letter questions Jack Hitt's assertion in August 20 article that piracy at sea is justified because of inability to fit into modern international trade markets (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Hitt writes that piracy is ''a troubling symptom of a new world order, one shaped by a fierce Darwinian struggle in the feral markets of modern international trade.'' In so doing, Hitt seeks to assign a rational, and moral, motivation to the acts of these pirates. He says, in effect, that since these people do not achieve their aims within the confines of capitalism, it is all right for them to resort to violence and theft to achieve their aims. This is absurd!</p>
        <p>Pirates are principally a product of cultures where force is an acceptable means of achieving one's aims and where the state has instituted or supported a morality that does not value the rights of the individual. Such cultures are the province of bullies and dictators and are ruled by the club, the fist and the gun. Unfortunately, our world is increasingly the home to such societies.</p>
