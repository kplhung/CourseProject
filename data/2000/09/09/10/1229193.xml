        <p>REGGIE SIOTECO is hearing voices in his head. They help him find you a pair of well-fitting trousers as efficiently as possible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sioteco, a manager at a downtown Old Navy clothing store, wears a headset while frenetically roaming the sales floor. The headset is connected to a walkie-talkie, which in turn is connected to Neil in the fitting room. And to B. J. on the sales floor. And to the entire stock room staff. In fact, to around 100 headphone-bearing employees all told.</p>
        <p>The idea is that if a customer asks for, say, an extra-large red polo shirt, Mr. Sioteco or anyone on the sales staff can radio three floors up to the stockroom to see if one is on hand. A trip upstairs is saved, time and energy are conserved, and customer service is maximized -- with one small hiccup.</p>
        <p>''It's a confusion to customers who think you're talking to them, but you're not,'' Mr. Sioteco said.</p>
        <p>So the only drawback of the customer service-maximizing headsets is that they can be disorienting to customers?</p>
        <p>''Hang on,'' he said, tuning into the headset. ''One of the other managers is trying to get a hold of me.''</p>
        <p>In this bustling technology nexus by the bay, thoroughly modern retailers like Old Navy, Gap and Virgin Records are putting technology to work, enhancing the buying experience by keeping waiting time to a minimum. With the headsets, employees can stay close to their posts -- where customers can find them -- instead of disappearing to another part of the building to confer with colleagues face to face.</p>
        <p>''You hate to leave the customer to go ask a question in the stockroom,'' said Arrickco Bell, manager of the American Eagle Outfitters store here.</p>
        <p>Is that such a problem at American Eagle Outfitters, whose stockroom is only a few feet away from the compact, single-story sales floor? Mr. Bell said that no distance was too short for communication over headphones -- he has used his at a range of less than 10 feet. The deciding factor is the situation, he said, not the proximity.</p>
        <p>Using a radio headset to communicate with someone within loud-talking distance may seem extreme to the uninitiated, but Mr. Bell said that you have to think of the bigger picture.</p>
        <p>''We're the flagship store,'' he said, explaining that the headsets also had a symbolic purpose. ''We even use them in our smaller stores, which have two or three employees.''</p>
        <p>As for the rank and file at headset-forward retailers, some swear by the electronic addenda to their uniforms. Others don't. A security guard at the Virgin Megastore who would give his name only as Buddy said he tried wearing the headsets for a while, and allowed that they had their advantages. But in the end, he said, he asked his supervisor to relieve him of his, because of the possible disadvantages.</p>
        <p>''They'll get you killed,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>His point was that if he were to give chase to a thief, the thief could easily grab the headset and use it to strangle him. ''It's the first thing they'll go for,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Aside from risking violent death, some employees say they get periodic headaches from the constant chatter they hear on the headsets. And at especially busy times, like weekends, when the headsets would seem to be  most useful, they turn out to be, well,  too useful.</p>
        <p>''I'm talking to a customer, and I hear in the background: 'Reggie, are you on? Reggie, are you on?' '' Mr. Sioteco said. He tries not to answer radio calls, he said, if it would mean  interrupting a customer. He has an ironclad rule that the customer comes first.</p>
        <p>Where does the headset come?</p>
        <p>Third, he explained -- after the customer and then the employee. At the moment, three employees were demanding his attention -- two of them on the headset.</p>
        <p>One is calling from the stockroom. The second, a fellow manager, calls to interrupt the first conversation, saying he needs to chat with Mr. Sioteco privately, which means that Mr. Sioteco will have to find a phone. The third employee is also wearing a headset, but she has walked over to talk to Mr. Scioteco in the flesh, and evidently has gotten close enough to be eligible for person-to-person contact wholly unaided by technology -- about a foot away.</p>
        <p>''There are too many conversations,'' he says, laughing at the situation.</p>
        <p>True, but look at the upside: he isn't being strangled to death.</p>
