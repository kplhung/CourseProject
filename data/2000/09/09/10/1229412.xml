        <p>Over all, Americans are richer than ever, but as the wise have known for generations, money does not buy happiness. A recent survey by PaineWebber adds more evidence.</p>
        <p>Americans' household wealth rose 11 percent last year, to an average of $413,000, although the range varies wildly,  with the bottom 40 percent having little or no net worth.</p>
        <p>But as wealth increased and incomes rose, PaineWebber said, people wanted more time than money. The survey, conducted with the Gallup organization and involving 1,000 people nationwide, found that 35 percent were spending more on vacations, and that 60 percent planned to work in retirement, not for the money but for the enjoyment or the challenge.</p>
        <p>The respondents also showed more willingness to pay for top-notch, trouble-free  service or to accept deep discounts for no-frills service, but to reject anything in between.</p>
        <p>A National Center for Health Statistics survey cited by PaineWebber showed that as income rose, so did stress levels. About 55 percent of people with incomes of more than $50,000 reported either a lot of stress or moderate stress in their lives, compared with 45 percent of those getting by on $20,000 to $25,000 and slightly more than 40 percent of those earning $7,000 to $10,000.</p>
