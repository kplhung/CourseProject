        <p>TO say that this year has been difficult for James E. Goodwin, the chief executive of the UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, would be a vast understatement. During his one-year reign, United has been hit with problems that might well sink many a company.</p>

        <p>TO say that this year has been difficult for James E. Goodwin, the chief executive of the UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, would be a vast understatement. During his one-year reign, United has been hit with problems that might well sink many a company.</p>
        <p>The trouble began in April, with the expiration of its contract with the Air Line Pilots Association. As negotiations dragged on, pilots began refusing to work overtime. In June, the union voiced opposition to UAL's planned merger with U S Airways, concerned that the deal would jeopardize jobs.</p>
        <p>From May through August, United canceled 4,800 flights -- 4 percent of its total -- because of worker shortages, leaving many passengers stranded in airports for hours, sometimes days, with no easy routes to their destinations. And weather-related delays compounded the problem.</p>
        <p>Though the airline has reached a tentative pact with its pilots, it faces another potential contract battle with the International Association of Machinists.</p>
        <p>UAL's convoluted corporate structure has not helped matters, either. The board includes, in addition to insiders and outside executives, members chosen by union and nonunion workers. Employees gained board representation and majority stock ownership in exchange for pay cuts in a 1994 restructuring.</p>
        <p>Since reaching a 52-week high of $79 in January, UAL's stock has plummeted; it closed at $46.63 on Friday.</p>
        <p>What can be done to repair United? Money &amp; Business asked nine experts who track the airline industry to offer their insights; the advice ranged from improving customer service to canceling the pending merger.</p>
        <p>The airline's officials are scrambling to repair the damage, and some relief may be in sight. The pilots agreement is scheduled for a vote in October, and Matthew Triaca, a spokesman for the airline, said that the negotiations with the machinists union were well under way and that he expected an agreement soon on that contract, too, helping to smooth labor relations and get flights back on track.</p>
        <p>United is also trying to win back customers with bonus frequent-flier miles. And it is banking that a dose of humility will help, too. In August, Mr. Goodwin appeared in a 30-second television commercial apologizing for United's poor service. The company has also taken out full-page ads in newspapers. ''We are working hard to bring the operation back to normal and restore the confidence of our customers,'' Mr. Triaca said.</p>
        <p>That is no easy task. No one envies the challenge Mr. Goodwin faces in turning around United. Here are excerpts from the experts' comments.</p>
        <p>SAM BUTTRICK  Airline analyst at PaineWebber.</p>
        <p>At the root of the problem is the simple fact that labor has excessive structural leverage.</p>
        <p>Any union group has a large bag of tricks it can rummage through when it wants to express itself. There has been a statistically significant change in behavior with the unions, which, while consistent with the letter of the contract and letter of the law, enables labor to hold management hostage with tens of thousands of customers daily -- and that's not right.</p>
        <p>We're very concerned by the implications that the recent tentative agreement has on cockpit crew costs. It is total capitulation by United Airlines management. I wouldn't have agreed to a contract that gave the pilots the opportunity to work overtime, but did not require them to take it on. That leaves management at the mercy of the pilots' willingness to work overtime.</p>
        <p>At the core of all this is that labor has significant leverage over the quality of the operations. Management needs to be empowered more, to curtail job actions. Managing labor expectations is a very tricky part of running an airline.</p>
        <p>I don't see an intractable problem with customers. Getting customers back is very easy. An airline business is a network business, and United has a terrific network. People use the airline based on its schedule and network.</p>
        <p>If you look at the last decade of on-time performance, United has never been an on-time airline, yet its financial returns are near the top of the pack. They should have frequent-flier inducements, and as fall-season loads decline from summer peaks, we could see fall sales. They could toy around with some performance guarantees, providing frequent-flier miles for excessive flight delays or cancellations. It may be administratively tricky, but it has an intuitive appeal, providing customers remuneration for substandard operations.</p>
        <p>If they made me C.E.O., I would call off the U S Airways merger. It's time for United to focus on getting its own act together, instead of embarking on highly risky operations with integration issues that will exceed problems that United saw this summer. I don't think they're up to the task of merging. If they can't handle their own pilots, they're not up to the task of acquiring another airline.</p>
        <p>GERALD MEYERS  Professor of organizational behavior, University of Michigan Business School.</p>
        <p>They've got multiple crises going on: industrial and human relations. None of them are easy to solve. The first one that is amenable to treatment is the public perception crisis. They realize that what customers, the public and regulators think of them requires a full-blown, singular, all-out initiative, not just something that tags onto other things. It requires a crisis team, a crisis plan.</p>
        <p>They need training in the organization on how to deal with this and experts to help them -- an effort by itself. Included in that are crisis communications people. They should bring them in. In my view they need to look at themselves from the outside and say they're going to do better. They have to see themselves as other people see them. They're in the public service business. They need to keep customers happy.</p>
        <p>United should drop the ESOP [employee stock ownership plan, created in the restructuring six years ago]. It saved the airline, but it doesn't have a future. They should let the unions see they will get their money back and return the company to the managers. You can't change the management if the unions run it. The board of directors is useless. They can't talk about cost reduction.</p>
        <p>ESOP's have their problems, and very few are successful. It's a source of the current problems. Once the ESOP is dissolved, the anger begins to diminish and the internal stuff on who's running the company will be minimized. You will have a schedule for how the current problems will be resolved over time and make clear there is a plan to make the company profitable and distribute the wealth. United is not a backward airline. They've got awful labor relations. Once that's solved, they will run a good airline and get people happy and satisfied and excited.</p>
        <p>BARBARA BEYER  President of Avmark Inc., aviation consultants.</p>
        <p>They desperately need to rebuild their image. At this point, everybody's really mad at them, including me. I fly 30,000 to 40,000 miles a year with them. I think what they desperately need to do is have better control over delays and send their flight attendants back to charm school.</p>
        <p>If you think about it, the airline is a public utility. The only thing that makes it different is passenger service. When it's bad, you want to go to another airline. They need to teach employees manners. They've lost sight of the service attitude.</p>
        <p>They aren't practical about the fact that they are having delays. If there's a delay, they should take full-fare passengers off the airplane and rebook them. They need more staff at counters.</p>
        <p>ROBERT ROACH Jr.  General vice president of the International Association of Machinists.</p>
        <p>We went to a meeting called by Transportation Secretary Robert Slater, and the one thing that came out of it was that airline carriers need to better communicate with passengers.</p>
        <p>We need to better use technology to better communicate with passengers at airports. We should advise customers about delays so the customer can't scream at an agent. Also, if a customer comes to an airport to get on an airplane and pushes employees, he should be arrested and not be allowed to fly that aircraft.</p>
        <p>And we should make people aware of what they'll confront when they start their journey from home. There is anxiety built into flying: nervousness, packing, the fear people have of flying. The airlines need to start educating you when you buy the tickets about the delays. Expect that weather delays are possible.</p>
        <p>Agents should make frequent announcements about reasons for delays, so people won't get mad. Today, people assume that if anything happens, it's labor's fault. That's not the case.</p>
        <p>We are negotiating an agreement with no efforts to disrupt United. Once the contract is swiftly resolved, it eases the tension. We need to move the process very quickly and that's what we intend to do. Then there will be no unsettled labor issues and no tension between labor and management. There is not a bad group of employees creating this. The problems are built into the system.</p>
        <p>PAUL HUDSON  Executive director, Aviation Consumer Action Project, an airline-passenger advocacy group.</p>
        <p>The biggest problem is they have a credibility gap with their customers.</p>
        <p>They have not been meeting their schedules. If you know you have no resources to make the flights, cut back the schedule. If you can't fly planes on time, change published times to be more accurate and reflect the reality.</p>
        <p>We've petitioned the D.O.T. [Department of Transportation] for a truth-in-scheduling regulation. For flights that are chronically delayed, there would be mandatory disclosure of on-time statistics by fax or telephone. If most people knew the on-time statistics for a lot of these flights, they wouldn't book them. Flights delayed over 80 percent of the time would need to be scheduled accurately or wouldn't be flown. They would cancel the flight until it could be scheduled to run on time.</p>
        <p>Lack of spare airplanes and over scheduling are the biggest reasons for chronically delayed flights, not labor disputes or equipment failures or air traffic control or weather.</p>
        <p>They are booking more flights than airplanes and crews can handle. I also feel that the government should require mandatory reserves of airplanes and flight crews of 3 percent. They are operating with less than 1 percent now. They're expecting that 99 percent of pilots will show up and that 99 percent of planes will be operating.</p>
        <p>They should also stop overscheduling, especially at their hub, Chicago O'Hare. They schedule more airplanes to take off than the airport has capacity to allow. There's no way that can work.</p>
        <p>And stop holding people in the airplane for excessive amounts of time. This is not necessary.</p>
        <p>It also burns a lot of fuel and causes other problems. Most passengers would rather be in the airport for excessive waits.</p>
        <p>STEPHEN A. GREYSER  Professor of marketing and communications at Harvard Business School.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, the bottom line for the consumer is that company behavior is far more important than whatever public relations or advertising the company may put out. I'm not suggesting that advertising and public relations are unimportant. But by themselves, they aren't going to do the job.</p>
        <p>What the company has to do is improve the reality of the customer service, and that includes the scheduling. That includes handling on the telephones. That includes what happens in the departure lounge, and that includes what they do by way of keeping their customers who are in the lounge area informed about the truth of what's going on.</p>
        <p>Many times they are not forthcoming in terms of providing truthful information, especially when there's an opportunity for a customer to go to another airline. Obviously they hate losing customers, but that's short-term thinking. The customer will remember she wasn't treated like a customer.</p>
        <p>Dealing with the schedules is complicated, but thinning out the schedule is something they can do on their own. The first step is to reduce the schedule overload. Obviously they've got to fly planes to make money. But having large numbers of passengers complaining is not good for the company's image or reality.</p>
        <p>They also need more people on  telephones handling customer complaints. From a marketing point of view, they have to focus on frequent fliers. They have to develop a statement of fulfillable promises backed up by the commitment at all levels of management and the airline's operating group, a commitment to true customer service.</p>
        <p>RANDY PETERSEN  Publisher of Inside Flyer magazine, a publication for frequent fliers.</p>
        <p>The first thing I would do is I would probably resign. I believe they mishandled the crisis control. They thought that if they ignored it, it would go away. Customers don't go away anymore. I would hire another crisis control adviser.</p>
        <p>I still fly United and think they're a good airline. But I would get all the people who work for the company on the same page. I think I would owe an apology to the employees who were put on the firing line. I would go back to employees and let them know we let them down as a company and make them happy. If you take care of employees, they take care of the customers. There needs to be a lot of healing. I would spend every single day on the job with my employees and the people on the front line, not giving away miles or discounts. Those are pacifiers for passengers. It's just bribery. That doesn't heal what's wrong with United.</p>
        <p>United won't be ready for Thanksgiving or Christmas unless they heal themselves. The guy who works the checkout counter in Denver, the customer service manager in San Francisco. Those are the people I think I would talk to, and as C.E.O., I would not sleep until I talked to them all.</p>
        <p>SANJAY DHAR  Professor of marketing, the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.</p>
        <p>The key thing is getting consumer retrial -- the people who left United for other airlines. Management should feel confident that problems are being addressed and share information that the pilots are the highest paid now and that the operations are being streamlined.</p>
        <p>They should continue using Jim Goodwin but use a more solid message to say ''these are the things we've done'' and come up with very tangible things, like what Jacques Nasser did with Ford to respond to the Bridgestone tire crisis.</p>
        <p>Goodwin has the biggest stake in the company, and he should communicate the message. United's top brass have a role to play in building confidence within their ranks. They should say, 'This is a company you should be proud of.' That's reassurance-building among customers.</p>
        <p>Then you have to get people to try the airline. There could be financial incentives, or ''buy two fares, get the third one free,'' or a sharp discount for flying on major routes. They could figure out how to recapture a dominant position in routes lost to other airlines, and offer a steep discount on those routes. That won't start a price war, because you're only offering it on specific routes.</p>
        <p>ALFRED KAHN  Professor emeritus of political economy, Cornell University, and chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, 1977-78, during airline deregulation.</p>
        <p>United's problems are a result of excessive congestion at particular airports at particular times. There are two major remedies that are obvious. First, we have to get some system for providing air traffic capacity that is sufficient. So the question is whether the F.A.A. and air traffic control system are ideally set up to respond to needs for additional capacity. And there have been various commissions recommending corporatization of control.</p>
        <p>The second is correct pricing. Excessive congestion at certain times and places means you are undercharging. All airlines should charge more when it's more congested and less when it's not. Charges for phone calls are different at peak times than in the middle of the night.</p>
