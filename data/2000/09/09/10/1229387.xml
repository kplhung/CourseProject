        <p>DEMOCRACY is about choice, but in the Yugoslav version, which is now playing itself out with Slobodan Milosevic's future at stake, there are likely to be more choices than usual.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic, Yugoslavia's president, changed the Constitution to make his office subject to direct election, and he has now called a vote nine months earlier than he had to. So on Sept. 24, Yugoslavs will vote for a federal president, Parliament and municipal officials in an election that will appear like most others, with voters getting to choose between the incumbent and his party, and an array of challengers.</p>
        <p>But as election day approaches, a strong opposition candidate is doing better than Mr. Milosevic in the opinion polls, and this points up the piquancy of Yugoslavia's system. Mr. Milosevic also gets to make a choice: whether to accept the choice of  the people if it goes against him, or to  manipulate the totals and declare victory regardless.</p>
        <p>And then the people will have another chance to choose, but not in the voting booths: will they accept Mr. Milosevic's choice, or will they come out onto the streets to defend their own choices, possibly against the arrayed power of the police and even the army.</p>
        <p>This is a political netherworld, in which the forms and substance of both democracy and authoritarianism are clearly visible. In an instructive way, they live side by side here, and both have their limits, depending on the stakes. But with Mr. Milosevic's own hat in the ring the hopes of long-divided opposition leaders are coming up hard against their cynicism. This is, after all, a system that Mr. Milosevic, a master technician, has manipulated when necessary for the last 12 years.</p>
        <p>''This is a kind of authoritarianism that needs a form of democratic legitimation from time to time,'' said Vojislav Zanetic, a marketing consultant, playwright and columnist.</p>
        <p>''This is a pseudo-democracy, in which the opposition is complicit,'' he said. ''It's a kind of society that must fall apart slowly -- it can't be ripped apart in one day, in one election. We don't have a political crisis here or even an economic one -- we have a systemic crisis, a crisis of society and political will.''</p>
        <p>It is a form of parallel political universe. There is a campaign, with speeches and tours and open meetings. There are billboards and opinion polls and marketing experts. There are monitors ready to examine the voting and counting procedures, and Web sites devoted to the election and the campaign.</p>
        <p>And even though the state media, especially television, are thoroughly and aggressively in the hands of Mr. Milosevic, there is a lively independent press, including local television and radio, that is both outspoken and combative in the face of government pressure and derision. In general it has lined up dutifully in support of Mr. Milosevic's main rival, Vojislav Kostunica.</p>
        <p>Yet among these opponents there is also a resigned conviction that Mr. Milosevic will steal as many votes as he needs to ensure  victory in the first round -- since he needs an unquestionable victory to achieve his aims of re-legitimation.</p>
        <p>And that adds a new quality of edge and risk. ''For Milosevic, this election has turned into Russian roulette,'' one opposition leader said. ''But for him to allow a second round would be suicide.''</p>
        <p>But what of the people of Serbia? Will they defy the regime and defend the opposition or their own choice? Among the opposition, there are deep concerns that the Serbs, atomized and impoverished, will not.</p>
        <p>''Frankly I'm not so optimistic,'' said Vuk Draskovic, the head of the Serbian Renewal Movement, who is living in Montenegro after two attacks on his life. ''All of us together are fighting a battle we cannot win. I'm quite sure Milosevic has right now in his pocket the result of the elections. What will happen after 24 September, when the opposition people will face the crackdown on their hopes?''</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Kostunica says that ''people are fatalistic about the way they see these elections.'' Many of his own supporters in the polls, he said, ''believe that Milosevic will win.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica plans to declare victory the night of the election, as his aides presume Mr. Milosevic will. In the case of massive election fraud, he hopes people will come out into the streets the way they did for months after Mr. Milosevic refused to acknowledge opposition victories in the 1996 local elections.</p>
        <p>But even Mr. Kostunica is not sure they will.</p>
        <p>Natasa Kandic, director of the Humanitarian Law Foundation here and a critic of Mr. Milosevic and Serb actions in Kosovo, said that Mr. Milosevic won't freely cede power even if everyone voted against him.</p>
        <p>''What will happen, I don't know,'' she said. ''It is, however, important that we do not sit at home on Sept. 24, but go outside and defend our votes.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Kandic is facing troubles of her own; the Yugoslav Army is threatening to bring her to court over articles she wrote criticizing the behavior of Serbian forces in Kosovo. (She has also criticized Albanian attacks on Serbs after the war ended.) The army's threats are part of a skillful effort by the government to intimidate opposition leaders and their supporters, including the student movement, Otpor, or Resistance. The message is clear: the government will react with force, if necessary, against any revolution in the streets.</p>
        <p>THERE are, in addition, mysterious events that create a chill, like the kidnapping two weeks ago of the former Serbian president Ivan Stambolic, who was Mr. Milosevic's mentor.</p>
        <p>In a swift party coup, Mr. Milosevic ousted him in 1987. Although there have been rumors -- which his wife denies -- that Mr. Stambolic was considering a run for the presidency, Mr. Milosevic and the government forcefully deny any role in the disappearance.</p>
        <p>These events create an undercurrent of tension quite apart from Mr. Milosevic's political campaign against the opposition, in which he stresses its support for and ties to  the United States and the NATO countries who bombed Yugoslavia last year. The other night, for example, a news program on the state television cut from a meeting between Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and opposition leaders to a close-up of Mr. Kostunica, who had not attended, then  back to the meeting, giving the false impression that he, too, had been at the feet of Dr. Albright.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zanetic, the marketing expert, thinks the government is better than the opposition at propaganda and political marketing, understanding that most Serbs get their information from television.</p>
        <p>''In politics here, it doesn't matter if you tell the truth or lie -- you must be clear,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Which is why, if Mr. Milosevic claims victory, he is also likely to declare a landslide. And then one may better see where the new balance lies between democracy and authoritarianism.</p>
