        <p>Mount Vernon has raised parking fines and will step up enforcement in an effort to improve the city's quality of life. As of Sept. 1, the fine for double parking rose to $100 from $60, and for parking in a handicapped spot, to $130 from $80. The need for revenue was the main reason for the increases, Mayor Ernest D.
