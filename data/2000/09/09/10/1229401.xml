        <p>Is that Paul Newman at the head of the B-school class? Sure enough, one day last week, the blue-eyed box-office legend was advising budding moguls on how to give -- even before they make their millions.</p>
        <p>This semester, the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley is offering a new one-credit graduate class called ''Contemporary Philanthropy.'' It covers the giving of time, money or both.</p>
        <p>''The school recognized this is a subject that would be useful to our students,'' said M. Frances Van Loo, an associate professor of business administration who teaches the course. ''Some of our students do become super-rich overnight.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Newman spoke to the class on Thursday, offering advice gleaned from his many years of giving away money: through his Newman's Own line of salad dressing, sauces and popcorn, he has donated more than $100 million, all of its profits since its founding in 1982, to charity.</p>
        <p>Ms. Van Loo said she planned to ask other big givers, as yet unnamed, to speak to the students soon.</p>
