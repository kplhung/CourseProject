        <p>DAVID A. SPINA is the corporate incarnation of a soccer referee. He is also out to change the rules of the game at the State Street Corporation, the financial services company he heads.</p>
        <p>At recent employee meetings, Mr. Spina waved yellow ''warning'' and red ''ejection'' slips at executives who discussed their own projects instead of the company's larger goals. The message: State Street cannot tackle its long-held technology and global expansion plans unless it scraps its own turf battles.</p>
        <p>The cards, while playful, nonetheless signaled that Mr. Spina, 57, intends to make some changes at State Street, a 208-year-old institution that has transformed itself from a conventional bank into a giant back office for the global investment industry. Since he became chief executive in May, he has made his first goal clear: As markets and technology systems become more interconnected, his company, long marked by divisiveness, must undergo a cultural makeover.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spina is irked, for example, that his Canadian subsidiary recently declined to service the local pension plan of a multinational client. The branch said the plan was too small, but the client was an important customer in the United States.</p>
        <p>He winces when he talks about the chaotic Internet strategy he inherited last fall, when he was chief operations officer. ''Nothing was coordinated,'' he complained. And although State Street is known as a technology heavyweight, it still offers no Web-based trading at its money management unit.</p>
        <p>Even that unit, State Street Global Advisors, has sought to go its own way, pushing for a separate listing on Wall Street -- an idea that the parent company has rejected.</p>
        <p>''I don't like actions, recommendations or plans that aggrandize one part of the company,'' Mr. Spina concluded.</p>
        <p>State Street is not a household name. Its customers are mostly financial institutions, not ordinary investors. But over the last decade, it has become the nation's second-largest asset custodian, calculating daily values for nearly one-third of the United States mutual fund industry, providing accounting for institutional investors and pension funds and settling securities trades.</p>
        <p>Not only does it keep track of $6.1 trillion in assets, it is also the nation's third-largest investment firm, managing assets worth $729 billion, mostly for pension funds and corporate retirement plans. Although it sold what little remained of its commercial banking operations last year, it kept its bank charter to provide loans to institutional customers.</p>
        <p>In other words, State Street's world is not sexy -- it is the land of the humdrum mechanics behind rocket-fire capital flows.</p>
        <p>But the company, which has 17,500 employees around the world, has enjoyed double-digit annual revenue growth for 22 years. Its stock performance, though often choppy, has far outpaced gains by conventional banks lately. The shares have more than doubled since October, closing on Friday at $122.56.</p>
        <p>Now the company is at a crossroads.</p>
        <p>''The idea that you can have a vision that endures a long time is not valid,'' said Mr. Spina, sitting in his dark, wood-paneled office in downtown Boston, his suspenders splashed with suns, moons and stars. ''The world changes.''</p>
        <p>As its domestic market matures, State Street is looking toward Europe and Asia, where it is a growing but still minor participant among established competitors.</p>
        <p>It also wants to branch out from investment accounting and processing, its core businesses, into running the entire back offices of financial firms everywhere. But so far, only Pimco, a mutual fund company in Newport Beach, Calif., has signed up.</p>
        <p>Then there is its electronic data, research and trading program, called Global Link. The company wants this system, which investment managers use for analyzing global markets and trading  securities, to offer market data from competitors. But the move could undermine the value of State Street's own market data on the system.</p>
        <p>The plans are largely the brainchild of Mr. Spina's predecessor, Marshall N. Carter, who often thumbed his nose at Wall Street by spending lavishly on technology when analysts urged restraint. Mr. Carter, 60, whose retirement in May jolted analysts, was known as a visionary who turned his company into an investment services powerhouse but who stayed out of the daily trenches -- a hands-off approach that some industry watchers say spawned a divisive culture.</p>
        <p>By contrast, as one analyst put it, Mr. Spina is ''less presidential, more collaborative.'' Still, Mr. Spina often clashed with his boss, arguing that the core back-office systems needed as much investment as showy projects like Global Link.</p>
        <p>''Marsh was ready to issue an order and have others carry it out,'' mused Mr. Spina, whose focus on the back-office business and love of problem-solving are widely acknowledged to have made him Mr. Carter's successor. ''I might check on how they're carrying it out.''</p>
        <p>Born in Manhattan, Mr. Spina won an R.O.T.C. scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. He spent five years in the Navy, at one point serving as the captain of a patrol boat in Vietnam. In 1969, he joined State Street as a credit analyst. He later earned an M.B.A. from Harvard. Regarded by many in the industry as charming and intellectual, he has never worked at another company. He is a chocoholic (''What kind? Any kind.''), and he does not do casual Fridays.</p>
        <p>State Street has long staked its future on technology. Last year, it put 20 percent of its $2.3 billion in operating expenses into high-technology projects like Global Link. But ''the stakes are higher this time,'' said Michael Mayo, an analyst at CS First Boston.</p>
        <p>As part of his teamwork initiative, Mr. Spina recently created an inner circle consisting of him and his top three executives. Though the group has yet to take any major steps, its purpose is to ensure that the arms of the company know what the feet are doing.</p>
        <p>''They've seen where they have to go,'' said Ruchi Madan, a PaineWebber analyst. ''David is the operating guy who makes things happen, but they face some risk of losing momentum.''</p>
