        <p>One day, perhaps, the Oresund Fixed Link, the newly opened bridge, tunnel and road that has reunited Denmark with Sweden after a 7,000-year hiatus, will find its Hart Crane, who will rhapsodize about it in the way the American poet sang the praises of the Brooklyn Bridge. But probably not. While it is an engineering marvel, one bringing to fruition nearly 100 years of dreaming and planning and politicking, aesthetically speaking at least, the new span is not the stuff of verse. It is too long (10 miles) and too much of it -- nearly the first 4 miles heading east out of Copenhagen -- is under water. When it does surface from its tunnel, most of what's visible is an elevated causeway. Its middle section looks like a bridge, but its simple concrete towers, the tallest in Sweden, and the cables strung from them, are more elegant than mighty. And since the raised span is so far from shore, for all its size it seems small and slight, a few strokes from a finely pointed pen. If it inspires poetry, it will be less for its looks and more for what it portends: a Europe whose borders are slowly evaporating.</p>

        <p>One day, perhaps, the Oresund Fixed Link, the newly opened bridge, tunnel and road that has reunited Denmark with Sweden after a 7,000-year hiatus, will find its Hart Crane, who will rhapsodize about it in the way the American poet sang the praises of the Brooklyn Bridge. But probably not. While it is an engineering marvel, one bringing to fruition nearly 100 years of dreaming and planning and politicking, aesthetically speaking at least, the new span is not the stuff of verse. It is too long (10 miles) and too much of it -- nearly the first 4 miles heading east out of Copenhagen -- is under water.

Its middle section looks like a bridge, but its simple concrete towers, the tallest in Sweden, and the cables strung from them, are more elegant than mighty. And since the raised span is so far from shore, for all its size it seems small and slight, a few strokes from a finely pointed pen. If it inspires poetry, it will be less for its looks and more for what it portends: a Europe whose borders are slowly evaporating.</p>
        <p>''To forget swearing and cursing/ And drink a toast to each other/ So that They and We are becoming Us/ That's better than fighting,'' the Danish poet Benny Andersen wrote recently, upon the bridge's opening. It's also better, he added, than getting seasick going between the two countries -- something that apparently happened regularly to him on the old ferry crossing.</p>
        <p>To the Danes and Swedes, the opening in July of the long-anticipated crossing has been both unifying and, at least temporarily, amicably divisive. The journey between Denmark's capital, Copenhagen, and Malmo, Sweden's third-largest city, which formerly took 45 minutes by ferry, has now been cut in half, whether by car on the upper span or on the train directly below. As limousines carrying the two countries' royalty cut through the various ribbons strung across the bridge on opening day, some of the air was filled with talk of how borders had ceased to matter, of the new megalopolis of three million people that had been born and of the cultural and economic cross-pollination, not only between Denmark and Sweden but also throughout unified Europe, to come.</p>
        <p>At the same time, there was plenty of telling talk about the differences between Danes and Swedes, and how they would outlast the diminishing physical barriers between the two countries. People argued over which side would profit more handsomely from the bridge, whose $3 billion price tag was borne equally by the two countries and will be recouped from hefty tolls: at the outset, about $30 a car (payable by cash, credit card or the Scandinavian version of EZ-Pass), though less for frequent travelers. These discussions invariably degenerated into analyses of which side needed the bridge more desperately to escape its own inadequacies, all of which fed stereotypes going back nearly as far as the ice age, which originally separated the two countries. To cite one example of the badinage, the Copenhagen City Museum staged an exhibition entitled ''Boring Swedes and Drunken Danes.''</p>
        <p>Some Danes will cross into Sweden for its beaches and wide-open spaces, but most predicted that, at least at first, the bulk of the traffic would head westward, Swedes in search of cheaper alcohol or the greater cultural and corporeal pleasures of a world-class capital. (In fact, early reports indicate that while traffic across the Oresund is up 75 percent since the bridge opened, it is pretty even both ways.) Danes grumble that, even visually, the Swedes made out better: from their end, after all, one gets to see the bridge, and against the sunset to boot.</p>
        <p>To Americans, largely oblivious to the nuances of Danish-Swedish relations, unconcerned with the economic possibilities of what promises to become a powerhouse of European commerce and unlikely to want to save a few kronen on liquor, the Oresund Bridge represents something else.</p>
        <p>To a people whose mass transit projects are perpetually mired in regulations and red tape -- consider New York's much talked about subways to its airports -- it is a reminder that such an ambitious project can actually be built, ahead of schedule, within budget and with no environmental disasters or lawsuits left over. The Oresmund Bridge opens up the virgin territory of southern Sweden, beginning with the city of Malmo and continuing into a largely undiscovered land of fishing villages, forests and bicycle trails, the home of Absolut vodka and the birthplace of the smorgasbord. And the crossing -- the 10th-longest bridge in the world, and Europe's longest rail bridge as well as one of its longest tunnels -- will surely become a destination in its own right.</p>
        <p>From a distance, the bridge looks unimposing, like a row of dominoes with a roadbed on top and two sets of chopsticks in between. Crane's Brooklyn Bridge has two majestic, cathedral-like granite towers, nestled between two proximate pieces of land; it looms imposingly from either shore. Andersen's bridge possesses no such magic. And even if the topography lent itself to something more epic 1/4 this is a more understated age, when expectations are more modest. Georg Rotne, the Danish architect who designed the bridge, said that it was made to look timeless, as if it had always been in place. Moreover, as bridges have gotten sturdier, they've also come to look more fragile. One Swedish journalist I spoke to said that it actually looked feminine. (But then, the Swedish landscape architect on the panel reviewing the bridge design complained that, in its stark angularity, it seemed positively masculine to her. Mr. Rotne himself is agnostic about the bridge's sex. ''I think about sex all the time, but we didn't put it into the site,'' he said.)</p>
        <p>Closer up, the bridge is sleek and handsome in its own understated way; one reporter compared it to a Bang &amp; Olufsen stereo. Originally envisioned by the politicians as a straight line, it was given a graceful curve by Mr. Rotne, the better to see the sea, the coastline and the bridge itself, as one drives across it. That pleasure will be enjoyed by car passengers only; while some 90,000 people bicycled, skated, ran and walked across the bridge in the days before it officially opened, there are no provisions for them now. Many Danes and Swedes will continue to take the ferry, which is cheaper and more leisurely; there, unlike in a car, one can enjoy a cold, duty-free beer while crossing the Baltic Sea.</p>
        <p>Talk of spanning the Oresund goes back more than a century. In 1888, there was a proposal to install a railway tube on the ocean floor between Elsinore, 30 miles to the north of Copenhagen, and Helsingborg, on the Swedish coast. That came to naught, as did a proposed bridge 50 years later. War -- specifically, the German occupation of Denmark -- and politics stalled the project until 1991, when the governments of the two countries agreed upon a combined road-rail link. The portion closest to Copenhagen would be under water, so as not to interfere with the city's busy new airport at Kastrup. The tunnel would surface at a new, man-made island, nearly two miles across. It was christened Peberholm, or Pepper Island; the entirely natural Saltholm, or Salt Island, is nearby.</p>
        <p>For the next nine years, construction proceeded; at one time, 5,500 people were working on the project. Along with such natural problems as dredging enormous mounts of material and building an island, workers had to contend with 15 British bombs left over from World War II that were found on the ocean floor. The project epitomized the new Europe: apart from the workers and materials from Denmark and Sweden, there were tunnel fans from Germany, tunnel siding from Italy, concrete from Spain. Dutchmen did some of the dredging; French alpinists helped string the cables.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the opening ceremony, I joined the entourage crossing the bridge back to Copenhagen. But apart from bragging rights over riding the route on its first official day of operation, I didn't gain much from the experience; from the bus, one couldn't even see the towers. I decided to return to the bridge the next day, after all the royal personages had gone back to their respective palaces. And, seeking to enjoy the latest feat in European mass transit, I decided to cross it by train.</p>
        <p>Expecting mobs of curiosity seekers, I got to Copenhagen's beautiful brick train station early that Sunday morning via the Stroget -- the lively pedestrian mall that runs through the old part of the city -- and the celebrated Tivoli Gardens. Once in the station, though, I encountered a vivid example of Danish nonchalance. It was as if, for Danes, it would be positively uncool to show too much enthusiasm for the new train connection; that was for their country cousins across the water -- repressed, boring, in search of novelty or at least a cold beer -- to do. (Even Mr. Rotne said he didn't expect to take his bridge very often. ''I don't see any particular reason to go to Sweden,'' he told me.) The crowds in the station were sparse; the clerk sold me my ticket -- about $15 round trip -- with no fanfare or knowing smile. He did tell me, his voice full of regret, that I'd just missed the latest train; of course, this being Europe, there'd be another one in all of 19 minutes.</p>
        <p>A few minutes shy of its scheduled departure, the train, a sleek streak of red, white and blue, pulled into the station. Its doors opened out, as if to welcome me inside. I took one of four facing seats, plush and blue, with clean and nicely cushioned white antimacassars on each. An elderly husband and wife, obviously thrilled by the prospect of reaching Malmo by train after 70 some years of ferries, sat across from me, waving at a younger woman, presumably their daughter, on the platform outside. When the train pulled out a bit late -- a few technical problems,'' the conductor explained in Danish -- she ran alongside for a bit, throwing kisses at she went.</p>
        <p>The perfectly tuned train, free of grime and graffiti, was not even one of the 27 new ones ordered especially for the bridge, as I later learned to my amazement. Gliding, it headed east. ''Welcome to the train that's going to Malmo,'' the voice, now in English, said over the public address system.</p>
        <p>The train made several quick stops, including at the Copenhagen airport. Then, within a few moments, it went subterranean. It traversed the tunnel at a brisk clip, the only sound a quiet, high-pitched whisper. For a couple of minutes, nothing was visible but the green-and-white emergency lights flashing by. Then, gradually, the darkness tapered off. Water and boats appeared above the horizon, and then the moonscapes of Peberholm. Reflecting the environmental integrity of the project -- some $80 million was devoted to such concerns, and environmentalists seem content with the results -- nothing was planted there; the idea is that the wind and the birds will bring seeds, and whatever will grow, will grow. Soon the train climbed to the underbelly of the bridge. I saw snatches of blue on either side of me, framed by the trusses of the bridge. And then, with people standing on the shore watching what was still, after all, a novelty, the train entered Scania, the southernmost province in Sweden.</p>
        <p>Scania, a part of Denmark until a bloody battle in 1658, still considers itself at least as much Danish as Swedish, and offers a concentrated dose of Scandinavia. There is wilderness and farmland and miles of beaches, for the sea is never more than an hour away; there are also hundreds of castles and at least 60 golf courses, said to be the highest concentration of them in northern Europe and evidence of the golfing craze that has hit Sweden in the last 25 years. One can go hiking and cycling and horseback riding, and book places not only in youth hostels but also in haylofts along the way. (A Swedish law known as allemansratten, or ''all men's right,'' lets people hike even in privately owned areas.) Scania has festivals for eels (a favorite local delicacy) and herring and crayfish. Each year, the town of Kivik names an Apple Queen. Lund, better known, perhaps, for giving its name to Monsieur Rick's eternal flame in ''Casablanca,'' is a university town dating back 800 years. I had time only for Malmo, which grew up around herring, withered for a while under the Swedes, sprouted factories in the 19th century and has flowered in its postindustrial incarnation.</p>
        <p>Architecturally, Malmo is rich and intact like Copenhagen, unscarred by wars and filled with the overlapping styles of many centuries. And though it is much smaller than its sister city, it offers two of the greatest, but increasingly elusive, pleasures of travel: the feeling of really getting away, and of really discovering something new.</p>
        <p>Malmo is surprisingly polyglot; many Holocaust survivors found new homes and rebuilt their lives here following World War II, and it continues to receive refugees warmly; 30 percent of its residents come from other countries. ''Our neighbors in Scandinavia haven't been as open as we have,'' Charlotte Hago of the City of Malmo's press office told me. But the town of 255,000 people also remains true to its Swedish self. It is a place where one encounters few American corporate logos (only those stalwart advance scouts of American cultural hegemony, McDonald's and Burger King, thus far), and where one is blessedly unlikely to understand the conversation at the next table.</p>
        <p>For a day I bicycled around Malmo with Ms. Hago. It is a gentle and beautiful place, filled with manicured parks and crisscrossed by roads whose every curb seems contoured for bicycle tires. We rode along the beach by the bay, with the Oresund Bridge visible in the distance, and to the Ribersborgs Kallbadhus, where men and women have taken saunas and dipped into the Baltic, icy or otherwise, for 100 years. We went to the 16th-century Malmohus Castle, now home to several museums. We had tea in the botanical gardens. And then we biked into the Old City, with its series of lovely interlocking piazzas. That evening, we sat with thousands of others in one of them, drinking Carlsberg beer and watching the finals of the European Cup soccer championship on a giant television screen. I felt I'd walked into a local festival, one to which tourists rarely find the way; and when France forced the game against Italy into overtime with only seconds left to play, I was pleased -- not so much because I wanted one team or the other to win, but because I simply was not ready for this magic moment to end.</p>
        <p>Taking the new train back to Copenhagen, looking out at the Whistler bluish-grays on one side and the salmon-colored sunset on the other, I was struck by one of the paradoxes of progress. The Oresund Fixed Link will rescue Malmo from its isolation, making it more accessible to people like me. But it will just as surely deprive it, and quickly, of its provincial charms.</p>
