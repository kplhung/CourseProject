        <p>WHEN it's time for Mike Hampton to decide where he wants to pitch next season, he'll remember Friday night's frustration.</p>
        <p>Not for his temper tantrum sparked by surrendering a two-run eighth-inning homer to Scott Rolen for the Mets' 2-0 loss to the Phillies and, after a walk, his removal. Not for flinging his glove into the dugout. Not for slamming the gum-holder. Not for leveling a plastic water cooler with his right forearm. Not for flinging his cap into the runway as he stalked to the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>No, he'll remember the frustration of a cut fastball that didn't cut and spoiled what could have been an important slump-snapping victory if the Mets' hitters had provided just a few runs.</p>
        <p>Over Hampton's last three starts, the Mets have supported him with a total of only 3 runs -- his 2-1 triumph over Arizona and his 2-1 loss in St. Louis before Friday night's frustration on the eve of his 28th birthday. But he didn't regret his outburst.</p>
        <p>''I don't try to please anybody, I don't try to look good for anybody,'' he said later. ''I show emotion once in a while. This was one of those cases.''</p>
        <p>But when Hampton, whose Mets salary is $5.75 million, sifts free-agent offers in the fall, he might prefer to join a team with a more explosive batting order. Maybe the Braves or the Yankees, or maybe he would just prefer to return to the Astros whence he came.</p>
        <p>Ever since Hampton lost his first three Mets starts, he's had a solid season. He's now 13-9 with a 3.19 earned run average, third in the National League behind the Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson and the Dodgers' Kevin Brown.</p>
        <p>And Bobby Valentine, who said he didn't see all of Hampton's outburst because he was on the phone to the bullpen, apparently did not scold him. If the Mets hope to sign Hampton, it wouldn't be wise to create a chasm between him and the manager, especially in September.</p>
        <p>''I like everything Mike Hampton does,'' the Mets manager said. ''I think he's hit enough water coolers to know how to hit 'em. I'm not upset with it.''</p>
        <p>In baseball, not every pitcher is an athlete. Some are just that, a pitcher who couldn't play any other position in the big leagues. But you could put Hampton, say, at first base or in the outfield, and while he wouldn't be Mark McGwire or Ken Griffey Jr., he wouldn't embarrass himself. Or his team.</p>
        <p>Coming out of Crystal River (Fla.) High School as a two-time all-state pitcher and defensive back, he spurned a a two-sport offer from Florida State.</p>
        <p>Just watching him pitch, you can see the athlete in him. In his quick serious steps striding to the mound. In his compact windup. In completing his follow-through with his glove in position to field a grounder or line drive. In being ready to throw the next pitch without any fuss.</p>
        <p>You can also see the athlete in him when he bats or runs the bases. Some pitchers just wave the bat; he swings it with a purpose. Some float around the bases; he sprints.</p>
        <p>But as a pitcher Hampton has proven to be even better than the Mets thought when they acquired him to provide what they didn't have a year ago: another ace in the marathon of the 162-game season and then in the crucible of the postseason.</p>
        <p>''His stuff is even better than I thought,'' Valentine said. ''His changeup is a power change because he throws it with a grip on it. I knew his 86-, 87-mile-an-hour fastball moved a lot, but he's shown a 92-, 93-mile-an- hour fastball when he needs it.''</p>
        <p>Dave Wallace, the Mets' pitching coach, sees something else in Hampton that sets him apart from many pitchers.</p>
        <p>''Mike's got that look,'' Wallace said. ''That look that defines so many great players. When you talk to him, he looks you in the eye. He's a no-excuse guy. And when he's not pitching, he's still competing. He's a prankster; he's sarcastic in a fun way. And if you come back at him, he welcomes it.''</p>
        <p>As a left-hander, Al Leiter understands Hampton's personality better than others might.</p>
        <p>''Mike and I have that goofiness, that humor that only a left-hander appreciates,'' Leiter said. ''There's a certain lightheartedness among us left-handers on this team -- Mike, myself, Johnny Franco, Glendon Rusch, Dennis Cook. It's a lightheartedness that's goofy, , geeky, whatever you want to call it.''</p>
        <p>But there was nothing lighthearted Friday night about Hampton's reaction to Rolen's homer and being removed. ''He threw a great game,'' Mike Piazza said, ''but obviously, one mistake killed us. He made a bad pitch to a good hitter.''</p>
        <p>If the Mets had scored a few runs before that bad pitch, Hampton would not have been so frustrated. And when it's time for him to decide where he wants to pitch next season, he'll surely remember those zeros on the scoreboard.</p>
