        <p>JONATHAN KELLY and Janice Gates Kelly had never paid a mortgage, let alone rent. Nor had they ever ripped open a telephone bill, cable bill or electric bill.

        <p>JONATHAN KELLY and Janice Gates Kelly had never paid a mortgage, let alone rent. Nor had they ever ripped open a telephone bill, cable bill or electric bill. For those who dream of college life going on forever, they had it down: living in a dorm, all the services they needed, and an army of potential friends.</p>
        <p>The trouble was, they were closing in on 30, and it started to feel a little strange. Ms. Gates Kelly, who has a master's degree in education administration, had been working for years as a resident adviser to college students, first in Buffalo and for the last four years at Barnard. Her husband, after getting a joint degree in business administration and law, had taken a job with Dewey Ballantine, a top New York law firm. On occasion, she said, his living arrangements provided the opportunity for some commentary. ''Someone once said, 'Is it true that Jon Kelly lives in a dorm full of girls?' ''</p>
        <p>Of course, they weren't literally living with them. The couple, who married in 1994 after meeting as undergraduates at LeMoyne, a Catholic college in Syracuse, occupied a two-bedroom apartment in the dorm at Barnard that was on the ground level, somewhat separated from the students. But at the State University of New York at Buffalo, where she had worked for two years of their marriage, their apartment was contiguous to the dorm rooms.</p>
        <p>''We went to bed at 11, and they were just getting started,'' she said. When it got really noisy, she said, she would phone the students, asking for a bit of peace. Or if it was very late, her husband would bang on the wall with his fist.</p>
        <p>More exhausting, ultimately, was the 24-hour nature of her job. She admired and enjoyed the students, and is a big fan of Barnard, but her day never ended. She wore a beeper and could be paged at any time, for problems ranging from a leaky sink to a medical emergency.</p>
        <p>''We were ready to move to the next stage of our lives,'' she said. As people who enjoyed projects, they were eager to take on something that needed work, something they could make their own. They had been carefully saving money for years; alluding to the popular financial planning program, she calls her husband ''Mr. Quicken.''</p>
        <p>SO last year at about this time  they started looking at apartments on the Upper West Side.  It quickly became obvious, however,  that the two-bedroom apartments they could afford were less appealing than the one they had -- and it seemed really ludicrous to begin paying for something worse. But they kept looking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly wanted to stay in Manhattan, he said, because he likes running in Riverside Park, and going out to brunch without planning or getting in a car, or being held to the train schedules that rule commuter lives. But after months of fruitless looking, he agreed to consider southern Westchester, where Ms. Gates Kelly grew up.</p>
        <p>Quickly, she found on the Internet a 1920's Tudor house in Edgemont , minutes from the village of Scarsdale and the train station there.</p>
        <p>They arranged with a broker to see that house as well as a few others, but it was no contest. The other houses had been fixed up, but the one in Edgemont won them over in part because it needed work and they wanted to transform something.</p>
        <p>To love it immediately, she said, was out of character for both of them. ''No one in our family could believe it,'' she said. ''Neither of us are impulsive people.'' Only two other times in her life, Ms. Gates Kelly said, had she immediately known she wanted something and acted on that decision instantly: ''An Ann Taylor dress, and John.'' They bought the house, which was originally offered for $499,000, for $432,000, with the broker chipping off $3,000 of his commission to help make the deal.</p>
        <p>The house, a beige stucco, is on a hillside, with three bedrooms and an office on the second floor and a gracious first floor with living room, den, porch, dining room and what will eventually be a large eat-in kitchen.</p>
        <p>They closed in February and spent months working on the house because they didn't need to move until June. ''We're both do-it-yourselfers,'' said Mr. Kelly. ''We would come up on weekends and work dawn to dusk. I like it. All week, we do mental gymnastics. It's a nice diversion.''</p>
        <p>They hired help for some projects but did much of the work themselves, with assistance from their families.  Mr. Kelly removed all the hardware, changed light switches and fixtures and cleaned the gutters. Ms. Gates Kelly made draperies for the living room with a sewing machine given to her by her father-in-law and, using a glue gun, matching shades for the wall sconces.</p>
        <p>Her mother made cushions for the sofas they found at a house sale, and also removed the electric blue paint from hardware. Her sister helped her apply a red glaze to the bedroom wall, which also took some salesmanship with her husband. ''He wanted everything beige,'' she said.</p>
        <p>THE beautiful old casement windows had deteriorated badly. They hired someone to strip the paint, and then someone else to bend the metal back into shape. ''He called himself a chiropractor for windows,'' Ms. Gates Kelly said.</p>
        <p>Their house is high on a hill, and on their screened-in porch it feels like a tree house, with only the sounds of the traffic and the train to remind one that this isn't really a forest.  They found porch furniture at garage sales, and Ms. Gates Kelly used a staple gun to re-cover the cushions in a cheerful yellow and green stripe.</p>
        <p>Nearly everything has been found or made in the last six months. Because they have lived in dorms all these years, they had so little furniture it all fit into the room that is now their den.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, Ms. Gates Kelly said, she misses her students. They would pop in to watch the television show ''E.R.,'' she said, or have a home-cooked meal. ''We would have great conversations about things,'' she said. ''They were with me through some tough times,'' such as her father's death several years ago.</p>
        <p>But their new home is working out just fine so far, even with the commute. She has started a new three-day-a-week job as director of residence life for the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan, which doesn't require her to live on campus.</p>
        <p>He is adjusting to the 30-minute commute, having discovered the shortcut to the train through the woods, and along the log over the stream. The neighbors have been friendly, although they're quite a change from the dormitory mates.</p>
        <p>''Here,'' she said, ''people think we're young. In Manhattan, people thought we were old.''</p>
