        <p>THE music department of the South Huntington school district has a simple philosophy: any student who wants to play an instrument will be encouraged to do so. And the results show.</p>
        <p>Last year, six South Huntington students (compared with 20 from New York City), were chosen for New York State School Music Association All-State performance events. They represented all of the performance categories: band, orchestra and chorus. (The district's performance groups also ranked high in the association's spring festivals.)</p>
        <p>And then there's the sixth grade band.</p>
        <p>At South Huntington's Silas Wood sixth grade center, every student participates in a performance program. And most of those students continue in music, with 70 percent participation through the middle school years. Last year's sixth grade band received a rare ''gold with distinction'' award, for a level three Nyssma festival performance, a level usually reserved for older students. South Huntington's band was the only sixth grade band in the state to receive that distinction.</p>
        <p>''That's quite a feat,'' said Dr. Burt Nelson, executive director of the school music association. Mr. Nelson cited the district's accomplishments as a ''special reflection of quality.''</p>
        <p>Izzet Mergen, the 31-year-old sixth grade band teacher, said the music program's success was a result of ''a combination of a very sympathetic administrator, teachers who really care about the students and devoted students and parents who show great interest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mergen is what Ken Schwartzman, director of the district's music program, called ''the paradigm of the school music teacher.'' He is also a session musician who has played drums on numerous commercials and has performed with artists like Wyclef Jean.</p>
        <p>He has challenged his students to the point that they exceed his expectations. ''You can't just sit on your past laurels,'' Mr. Mergen said. ''Every year is a new challenge. I just try to get the kids to work at their greatest potential and have fun doing it.''</p>
        <p>Ron Stanton, a trombone player who teaches seventh and eighth grade band, has had a successful career as a freelance musician on Broadway and with local big bands.</p>
        <p>The students' enthusiasm for music starts with people like Carol Vaccariello, 30, the intermediate school string and orchestra teacher. In the district, students start performance lessons in fourth grade and Ms. V, as she is affectionately called by students and parents, is often their first introduction to music. By the time students leave her they are musically literate.</p>
        <p>She is one of those teachers who gets year-end letters expressing appreciation for changing children's lives. And that is important to her, because music changed her life.</p>
        <p>When she was a freshman in high school, her father died of cancer. His illness had thrust her home life into disarray. ''Music saved me,'' Ms. Vaccariello said, ''and I want to be there for other kids the way some of my teachers were there for me.''</p>
        <p>When Ms. Vaccariello was hired by the South Huntington district, she also had numerous job offers. She chose South Huntington, she said, because of Mr. Schwartzman.</p>
        <p>The district's music teachers, who consider one another friends, say that Mr. Schwartzman's open, inviting policy, and the noncompetitive nature of the program, is what creates success. They also cite school principals, like Richard McNamara at the middle school, for being supportive.</p>
        <p>But it comes down to the teachers, Mr. Schwartzman said.</p>
        <p>One, Anthony Pinelli Jr., a 10-year veteran, is a homegrown success story. Not only did he attend school here, he returned to teach strings and orchestra to middle school students. As with the other music teachers, he performs on his off time -- in a jazz duo with Art Romeo, the high school music-theory teacher. He also conducts the Camerata Sinfonietta, a regional youth orchestra, with Mr. Schwartzman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pinelli, 31, is determined that his students enjoy their time with him, but it is also important that they learn, so he introduces different types of music from Mozart to African chants to rock.</p>
        <p>''I respect what they listen to,'' he said, ''and I want them to learn to love all music and be inspired by the teachers here the way I was.''</p>
        <p>One such student, Alicia Latten, 18, now attending Indiana University's School of Music, is considering a career as a school music teacher. Mr. Pinelli and his wife, Luella (who also teaches in the district), taught, supported and later befriended Ms. Latten. ''They were invaluable to me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartzman, a graduate of Juilliard, is adamant about his students receiving full access to music. ''If a child wants to play the trumpet in this district, then by gosh, they'll play the trumpet,'' Mr. Schwartzman said. ''We give them every opportunity to participate from everyday school programs to summer programs.''</p>
        <p>More than 340 students participated in this year's summer music program.</p>
        <p>The district's high school chorus, the Voices of Walt Whitman, under the direction of Ellen McCarthy, has received Nyssma gold honors for five years at the highest level. ''That's mastery as routine,'' Mr. Schwartzman said. ''That's in rarefied company.</p>
        <p>''A music department can easily become the entertainment arm for the school, basically playing music for holiday concerts. But I want the students to find a passion for the music as well as learning the theories behind what they are playing.</p>
        <p>''When our students fare so well statewide, keep in mind that we're up against larger and wealthier communities likes Scarsdale where they send their children to private lessons or Juilliard Prep. Our children, for the most part, are prepared for these competitions by their teachers, which makes their impressive showing even more remarkable.''</p>
