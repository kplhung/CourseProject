        <p>The expanse of green lawn that stretches to the door of the Israeli Knesset rippled in the breeze, uncharacteristically empty of lawmakers and lobbyists. It was Israel's Memorial Day, when the country honors its fallen soldiers, and Parliament had dispersed to the country's military cemeteries for its annual somber reflection on the human cost of the Zionist enterprise.</p>
        <p>Azmi Bishara, however, was inside, enjoying the calm. A legislator who made a symbolic run for prime minister last year as the first Israeli-Arab candidate, Bishara had the flat-roofed bastion of Zionism to himself. Pointedly, he was not observing Memorial Day. The following day, he would drive to Amman to avoid the Independence Day celebration, which always reminds him of his conflicted double identity as an Israeli Arab.</p>
        <p>Sitting in his small, sparsely decorated office, Bishara was wearing a soft denim shirt and chain-smoking Marlboros. He looked very much like a grown-up version of the Hebrew University campus radical he once was, only better ironed and with a more neatly trimmed mustache. The four cell phones in his office beeped and bleated and vibrated without cease, and he spoke into them in rapid-fire Arabic, English and Hebrew. ''Hag sameach,'' he said teasingly in Hebrew, ending a call to an Israeli Jewish woman, a former aide. ''Happy holiday.''</p>
        <p>It was a private moment, but one that telegraphed much about Bishara's lead role in exposing and exacerbating the rift inside Israel between Jewish and Arab citizens -- Israeli Arabs who, in fact, increasingly prefer and demand to be called Israeli Palestinians. While Israel has struggled to make peace with Yasir Arafat's Palestinians, it has largely ignored those within its own borders.</p>
        <p>That population is now growing restive. Just how restive became clear on Independence Day. Traditionally, Israeli Arabs had always felt obliged to swallow their pride on the nation's birthday, grilling shish kebabs and tying Israeli flags to their car's antennas. In recent years, though, most of them have dropped that pretense and begun to mark the day as the nakba, ''the catastrophe,'' which is what Palestinians elsewhere call it. This year some went even further, marching to the weedy remains of villages destroyed in 1948, waving Palestinian flags and even burning Israeli ones. The startling images of young Israeli Arabs, their faces contorted in rage, momentarily diverted Israel's attention from its external peace problem to its long-neglected internal one -- the million Palestinians who live as second-class Israeli citizens.</p>
        <p>But the moment was short-lived. Within a couple of months, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government was in tatters, and, following the Camp David summit in July, the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks moved into a tense, high-stakes period. The Israeli Arabs were pushed back to the sidelines to nurse their grievances as a distinct, often overlooked group with needs and aspirations addressed neither by their status as Israelis nor as Palestinians. But their quietude should not be mistaken for quiescence. Should the peace process ever be concluded successfully, the Israeli Arabs will quickly claim a new status -- Israel's next great challenge.</p>
        <p>For now, they are on hold, but perhaps more than any other group they see their fate as directly tethered to the outcome of this fall's supposedly climactic negotiations. ''I think it can be said that our lives hang in the balance,'' says Nawaf Massalha, the deputy foreign minister, who is the highest-ranking Israeli-Arab official in the government. ''If we will have peace, if the violence and the terrorism really stop, it will make the atmosphere inside Israel easier for our population. But if there is war, it will be between my people, the Palestinians, and my state, Israel.''</p>
        <p>No one lives the duality more publicly than the 11 Israeli-Arab Knesset members who make up almost 10 percent of the lawmaking body. They compose a heterogenous, often bickering group whose internal feuds can border on soap opera. Nine of the 11 belong to Arab parties, 2 to Zionist parties. Ideologically, they run the gamut from 44-year-old Bishara, who is the emblem of radicalism, to Nawaf Massalha, 57, a senior Labor Party official who is the gravelly voiced symbol of accommodation.</p>
        <p>To some Arabs, the Israeli-Arab legislators are the ultimate collaborators, although Palestinian officials have found several to be useful liaisons. To many Israelis, in contrast, their loyalties are forever suspect -- so much so that Barak never considered including them in his consensus government, despite the fact that they are natural allies on his priority issue of peacemaking. Barak declined to do so even after he lost his parliamentary majority in July and even after the Israeli-Arab lawmakers twice saved him from losing subsequent parliamentary votes of no confidence.</p>
        <p>The official consensus, it is clear, still does not include the Arab minority. Arabs make up 18 percent of Israel's population, a proportion that, given the community's high birthrate, will inevitably increase barring an unexpected wave of Jewish immigration. But since 1993, when the Oslo interim peace agreement was signed, Israeli Arabs have seen their position become even more difficult. Not only are they outsiders in Israel, but if a Palestinian state is established, they will be outsiders there as well.</p>
        <p>Very few would consider moving to the West Bank and Gaza to join the Palestinian state. ''I can't see a mass movement,'' Bishara says. ''So much of the Palestinian identity has been based on the concept of return to the land. And the Arab concept of what is home centers on the village, or in some cases the town. You don't move.''</p>
        <p>Slowly, Israelis are beginning to contemplate what this may imply for them: the contradictions inherent in being a self-defined ''Jewish and democratic'' state. For the moment that remains a peripheral issue. But Lutfy Mashour, the editor of al-Sennara, an Israeli-Arab newspaper, predicts that this will not be possible for too much longer. ''The real issue of Israel is us,'' he says. ''It's not the Palestinians, the Syrians, the Lebanese. We are the real problem of Israel. We are the so-called Jewish question. Because we live here and we shall stay.''</p>
        <p>In contrast to Bishara, Nawaf Massalha spent Independence Day at the official Jerusalem residence of the president of Israel, celebrating with the foreign diplomats based in the country. As deputy foreign minister, he is a representative of an older generation, considered an Uncle Tom by Bishara and other younger politicos, just as he often sees them as endangering what he has worked for: ''integration, but not assimilation.'' He winced at the televised pictures of counter-Independence Day parades in Arab villages, at the young Israeli-Arab men draped in the Palestinian flag or the flag of the Hezbollah guerrilla movement.</p>
        <p>''They have a right not to celebrate,'' he said then. ''Let them stay home and cry from morning to night, if they want. But they can choose another day to mark the Arab tragedy. We'll never make it here if we challenge the basic symbols of the Israeli people, and the first basic symbol is independence.''</p>
        <p>Massalha is six foot five, and he walks slightly hunched over -- not a half-bad posture, considering what can be flung around those halls. As was pointed out by one too many Jewish politicians, he speaks ''flawless Hebrew.'' He can also schmooze. Watching him in action, in a literal back-patting session, another Israeli-Arab lawmaker rolled his eyes. ''Now you see why they love him? He plays their game.''</p>
        <p>He does not play it all the way, however, because they won't let him and he won't let himself. He may be the most powerful Israeli-Arab politician, but he hit the glass ceiling long ago. He may be Israel's deputy foreign minister, bouncing from Japan to Ireland to Poland, but, like other Israeli Arabs, he did not serve in the army, the most central Israeli institution, and neither did his sons.</p>
        <p>Massalha's village, Kfar Kara, insular and inbred, was good preparation for the Knesset. In the village, surrounded by cypress, fig and olive trees, the laconic Massalha comes to life. One Saturday there, Massalha took to the wheel of his government-issued Mazda, driving his own driver, Mahmoud Massalha. Mahmoud is a distant cousin; so is Massalha's wife, Syham. The Massalhas are one of six clans in the village, and there are about 1,000 of them.</p>
        <p>With each pothole we bump over, Massalha grows more animated, pointing out the accomplishments of his townspeople and his own as well. The village has clearly benefited from being home to him. Still, we come to a dead stop behind a truck hooked by a hose to a house. A terrible stench invades, part rotten egg, part dead fish. ''This is the perfume of the Arab village in Israel,'' he says, toying with his lavender air freshener. ''Honestly, I didn't arrange it. Electricity we got in '69. Water through pipes came in '63. But we don't yet have a sewage system.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, we moved on toward our destination, the object of his affection: a half-built house that is entered by a stairway suspended in space. Massalha took out a loan to build it for his son Mahmoud, a prison guard. Stepping over webs of wire on bare concrete floors, he proudly points out the living room to be, the kitchen, the regulation bomb shelter. ''Come to the window,'' he says, standing at a hole in the wall.</p>
        <p>He is looking down at the minarets of the town's four mosques and the red-tiled roofs, pointing to a hill. ''From there, the Jewish forces attacked this village,'' he says. Unlike Bishara and the younger generation, Massalha lived through the war that gave birth to Israel. He remembers the bloodshed, the frantic screams and the heartache of the day his entire village was ordered to leave at gunpoint. He was 4. ''That's my very first memory. That's when my life started. That was my wake-up call.''</p>
        <p>It was 1948. Massalha rode on his uncle's shoulders as they all fled, the women crying, the men shooting back. For a year, his family stayed in a neighboring village. Then the clan leaders, with the support of Jewish farmers who used to work the land beside them, brokered a deal that allowed Kfar Kara's residents to return.</p>
        <p>For 17 years, Kfar Kara, like the other villages, remained under strict military control. After sunset, no one could step outside into the street, not even to go next door. Bit by bit, the Israelis confiscated most of the town's land. But despite all this, Massalha says he always saw it as better to be ''on ground zero of the conflict'' than to remain a refugee forever.</p>
        <p>After 1949, he says, he had a nice childhood, with his nine sisters and brothers. The top student in his class, Massalha was sent to Nazareth, some 40 miles away, for high school; his town didn't have one. On graduation, he taught for a while in the Arab schools but soon won a national trade-union scholarship and entered Tel Aviv University. He left there after three years for the union itself. Because of the close links between the unions and the Labor Party, Massalha was drawn into mainstream Israeli politics before Arabs were allowed to enter. In 1970, three years before the Labor Party officially admitted Arab members, he became the first Arab elected to the party's central committee of 500 plus one. He was the plus one. ''I came in through the window and opened the doors for those after me,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Back then, government officials openly called those like Massalha the ''positive Arabs.'' But Massalha shrugged it off. He was always pragmatic. ''If you want to change policy, you need to form a partnership with the Jews,'' he says. ''Look at the numbers. Right now, we are 11. They are 107. We can't do anything for our community without them.'' (The other two seats in the 120-member Knesset are held by members of the Druse sect of Islam, who do not consider themselves Israeli Arabs.)</p>
        <p>Late last spring, Azmi Bishara sat sipping espresso at Foujon, which is probably the only West Jerusalem cafe owned by a Palestinian. As he talked there, lighter and cell phone by his side, the hip young Israelis frequenting the cafe tried not to stare at the infamous politician in their midst. ''He certainly dresses better than the United Torah Judaism rabbis,'' one young woman says of the black-hatted ultra-Orthodox politicians in the Parliament.</p>
        <p>Some of those rabbis occasionally appear to be intrigued by Bishara's intellectualism. Once, Rabbi Avraham Ravitz grilled him during a Parliament debate about his ideology. The discussion became almost Talmudic. What does Bishara mean by nation, nationalism, nationality? the rabbi asked. Silvan Shalom, a rightist lawmaker, interrupted, shouting, ''What is this, a seminar?''</p>
        <p>Bishara, a philosopher by training, is indeed a bit academic for the Knesset. He also displays considerable chutzpah, even for an Israeli lawmaker, and especially for one who grew up Christian, Communist and Arab in the Jewish homeland.</p>
        <p>The urban cafe is to Bishara what the village hills are to Massalha: a place to smoke, to think, to reinvigorate himself. Massalha, a secular Muslim, represents that significant portion of Israeli Arabs who still live the life of the village, attached to the land, guided by the clan. Bishara is city folk, cosmopolitan, hypereducated.</p>
        <p>Compared with Massalha, Bishara was born into relative calm. The trauma of 1948 was his parents'. For his generation, the trauma was inequity, although he did not directly suffer it. His father was a government clerk and self-proclaimed Marxist, his mother an elementary school teacher. He attended a private school run by American Baptists. But at the end of the school day, he would travel to the poorer Arab villages to agitate among the students, outraged that their public schools didn't have libraries, gyms or science labs and that they were taught a version of Zionist history that presented their own parents as ''savages.'' He founded the first national Arab high school students group. He became a young Communist, on the party payroll.</p>
        <p>After Hebrew University, Bishara went to Berlin, got his Ph.D. in political philosophy and secured a professorship at the leading university in the West Bank. But in Jerusalem during the late 1970's, all he cared about was the struggle. Like Arab students everywhere, he had been inspired by the pan-Arab nationalist rhetoric of Gamal Abdel Nasser. Yet, unlike them, he was exposed to and tremendously stimulated by the Jewish left ''and all their universal ideas.''</p>
        <p>In 1976, at 19, Bishara became the youngest member of a committee that organized the first large uprising of Palestinians inside Israel. The protest -- against the government's plan to expropriate 15,000 acres of Arab land in the Galilee -- escalated into a violent confrontation with Israeli troops that left six Israeli Arabs dead and hundreds wounded. Land Day, as it was named, became a turning point for the previously docile Israeli-Arab community. Not only did it come into its own as a force inside Israel, but it also began to be embraced by the Arab world.</p>
        <p>''People felt their power for the first time, and they were afraid of it,'' Bishara says. ''The more nationalist you become, the more you separate from the state. And they did not want to separate. On the other hand, merely fighting for equality means playing by the Israeli rules. Such contradictions, our contradictions.''</p>
        <p>In the Knesset, Bishara's office sits right next to that of Ariel Sharon, who heads the opposition Likud Party. Sharon, of course, is an old-fashioned Israeli right winger, the kind who still openly distrusts Arabs.</p>
        <p>It is a sign of the changing times that Sharon provoked outrage here when he said recently that peacemaking, by relaxing border restrictions, would lead to ''a flood'' of Arabs into Israel's parks and beaches. But Sharon's statements express a discomfort that many Israelis feel even with those Arabs who live among them.</p>
        <p>For example, at a recent forum, a clean-cut Israeli-Arab academic, Michael Karayanni, mentioned that all vacancies had miraculously disappeared when he tried to find an apartment near his university outside Tel Aviv. Another professor, a Jewish man who labels himself a leftist, exploded at the insinuation that this might constitute racism. ''But that's a security issue!'' he said. In other words, Israeli Jews consider themselves justified in seeing every Arab, even an Israeli Arab, as a potential terrorist.</p>
        <p>For Israeli Arabs, those kinds of associations make even the issue of what to call themselves difficult. On the one hand, many reject the term Israeli Arab. ''It sounds possessive,'' Massalha says. ''The Jews say 'our Arabs.' But I am part of the Palestinian people. You can't cut me off by giving me a different name.'' On the other hand, their self-identification as Palestinians confuses those who equate all Palestinians with Yasir Arafat and think, Which side are you on?</p>
        <p>When a peace institute conducted a recent poll, it found that 70 percent of Israeli Arabs identified themselves primarily as Palestinians, compared with 27 percent in a similar poll five years ago. Responding to this shift, several Israeli-Arab lawmakers have jockeyed for the leadership of their community by trying to out-radicalize one another. On Independence Day, several marched to the ruins of villages destroyed by the Jews in 1948, for instance, in the company of young men who were burning the Israeli flag.</p>
        <p>''What I see happening is what I call the reopening of the 1948 files,'' says Elie Rekhess, an Arab politics expert at Tel Aviv University. ''I've always believed that while the Oslo process is bound to resolve the 1967 problem -- the West Bank, Gaza, Jerusalem -- it also highlights that some aspects of 1948 are still unresolved.''</p>
        <p>After the Palestinian Authority was established, Gaza City and Ramallah did not become meccas for the Arabs of Israel. But a cultural affinity began to blossom, nurtured by elite members of each world who did move back and forth, in a way exemplified by Bishara and another legislator, Ahmed Tibi.</p>
        <p>Tibi is a gynecologist who got into politics after he was thrown out of the Jewish hospital where he was doing his residency after clocking a security guard who stopped him suspiciously at the door. Last year, he formed a brief alliance with Bishara, which got both of them elected, Bishara for a second term, Tibi for a first. They have since split and grown to loathe each other, although they are mutually distrusted by Jews who look at their resumes and doubt their loyalty to Israel.</p>
        <p>After all, Tibi quit his post as a senior adviser to Arafat to run for office. He keeps a picture of Arafat, not Barak, in his Knesset office. And Bishara, who taught at the leading Palestinian university before entering Israeli politics, maintains an ever-closer relationship with the Palestinian leader. After Arafat returned from Camp David, Bishara spent almost two hours with him analyzing what had transpired. He said he sees a role for himself in helping Arafat to remain true to his purest positions -- on Jerusalem and the right of return of Palestinian refugees, for instance.</p>
        <p>It is an odd role for an Israeli politician; Arab colleagues joke that Bishara seeks to be more Palestinian than Arafat himself. But Bishara believes that if Arafat compromises too much now in order to secure an agreement, the agreement won't last, compromising everybody's future.</p>
        <p>Wincing at such talk, Massalha, forever an incrementalist, heartily advocates an imperfect agreement as better than no agreement at all. He says that the Israelis moved far closer to the Palestinian position at Camp David, offering ideas never before on the table. ''I don't see Arafat missing this opportunity,'' he says, ''and certainly no Israeli should encourage him to do so.''</p>
        <p>The Israeli-Arab lawmakers are naturally suited to be navigators between Israel and the Arab world. But their increasing participation in the larger Arab world discomfits many Israeli Jews, as when a delegation of them traveled to Damascus last June for the funeral of Hafez al-Assad, the late Syrian president and archenemy of Israel. In the last year, led by Bishara, Tibi and others, Israeli-Arab lawmakers have grown more confrontational. The double plank of their shared platform has always been peace and equality -- peace with Israel's neighbors and equality at home. But recently the planks have developed new edges.</p>
        <p>What most unnerves Israeli Jews is a series of bills that seek to nibble at the Jewish identity of Israel. One challenges the national anthem, another proposes that Israel pronounce itself a multicultural state or, to use the phrase that Bishara says he coined, ''a state of all its citizens.'' To American ears, this sounds innocuous, but to those Israelis who consider this the Jewish homeland, it sounds treasonous.</p>
        <p>Yoram Hazony, a conservative Jewish intellectual who heads a research group called the Shalem Center, says this kind of thinking contradicts the logic of Israel's engagement in the peace process. ''The whole idea was that there would be at the end two states, one Jewish, one Palestinian,'' he says. ''If now the goal is a universalist state in Israel, then why should we back a Palestinian state at all?''</p>
        <p>Bishara agrees and is clearly worried about the implications. ''Once there is a Palestinian state, our idea that Israel should be universalist loses out,'' he says. ''Israel will reassert its identity as the expression of the collective rights of Jews. Israel will say: 'You have a state. Here in Israel you can have individual rights, but not collective rights.' ''</p>
        <p>For the moment, though, Bishara still supports the ''two state'' solution. Someday, he suggests, the two states may have to consider merging into a binational state, so entwined are their populations, territory and economies. This is heresy to most Jewish Israelis, and to many Palestinians too.</p>
        <p>Massalha's modest home sits in downtown Kfar Kara. Inside, Massalha receives visitors in a formal room that looks as if it is waiting for a dowry negotiation between clans. Its stiff-backed chairs are upholstered in black-and-cranberry velvet. Coffee tables are laden with bowls of fruit and pistachios. Massalha's wife, Syham, brings in a copper pot of cardamom-laced coffee; Massalha serves.</p>
        <p>Most of the photo albums on the coffee table contain pictures of the late Yitzhak Rabin with Massalha. In 1992, Rabin started his ''Arab campaign'' for prime minister in Kfar Kara, with Massalha as his manager. Massalha revered him for the way, at 70, he embraced peace with Israel's neighbors and peace with Israel's Arabs. He talks about the gains that Israeli Arabs made during Rabin's tenure, when Massalha was deputy health minister. Rabin gave to them, Massalha said, and they to him: the Oslo agreement would not have passed without the Arabs' votes.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, even Rabin kept a tactful distance from the Arab parties. He relied on them, but he rebuffed the one party that made an active bid to join his coalition. The message was as clear then as it is now: they were not and still are not real partners because they scare the Jews, even the doves.</p>
        <p>During the Rabin years, especially after Rabin shook Arafat's hand at the White House and the peace process began, thousands of Israeli Arabs joined the Labor Party. ''It was a peak of Israeli-ization,'' Bishara says. ''People said: 'The Palestinian issue is solved. Let's all become Israelis.'</p>
        <p>''I saw the people attempting to integrate without having achieved equality. To look like Israelis, to act like Israelis, to imitate Israelis and to legitimize voting for Israeli parties, no longer out of fear but out of conviction. The only way to stop the process was to show the contradictions between their aspirations for equality and the nature of the Zionist state, which places Jews above others.''</p>
        <p>Bishara says it was this development that propelled him to quit academia and enter politics. He ran successfully for the Knesset in 1996, and then, looking to offer a ''lesson in citizenship,'' stunned the country by campaigning for prime minister last year. An Arab can't be the prime minister of Israel, he was told. ''Oh, really?'' he said. ''I didn't know that.'' Many Arab youths in Israel were impressed. ''They won't even let us be airplane pilots, and he thinks they'll let him run the country,'' Taher Abu Mahmoud, a student, said during the campaign.</p>
        <p>Still, Israeli Arabs saw Bishara's candidacy as symbolic. And after three years of a rightist government under Benjamin Netanyahu, they jumped at the chance to support a Jewish politician who pronounced himself Rabin's heir. They went door to door for Barak, who repeatedly pledged he would be the prime minister of ''ev-er-y-bo-dy.''</p>
        <p>Bishara never believed it, and since the election he has been saying ''I told you so'' a lot. Almost all Israeli-Arab leaders think that Barak, as Massalha says, ''has shown us his back.'' The pledged increases for their budgets have not materialized. But still, they support him. ''All the ingredients are there for Barak to do the same as Rabin,'' says Professor Rekhess, who advises the government on Arab affairs. ''All he needs to do is devote a little bit of time and money. If he did, much of the radical fervor would simply disappear. But the governments here move from crisis to crisis. And the Israeli Arabs are not yet a crisis.''</p>
        <p>As deputy foreign minister, Massalha is privy to some state secrets and has some influence on foreign policy, if not peace policy, which Barak controls. Bishara criticizes him for even serving in the post, saying that the foreign policy of Israel is a policy of aggression against Arabs. ''But I am comfortable with what I do,'' Massalha says.</p>
        <p>Still, it disappointed Massalha when Barak would not appoint him to a full ministerial post. Massalha had bumped up against the glass ceiling in a way that made him identify with the frustrations of the young Arab professionals who can't find jobs in their specialties. Massalha, after all, had been a deputy three times already. ''You are Arab, congratulations, you can be deputy,'' he says. ''Here are the keys to your Mazda.'' The ministers get Volvos.</p>
        <p>Frustrated and occasionally defensive, Massalha seems to take for granted the ground that he is breaking. Standing in the frame of his son's new house last spring, Massalha gave laconic interviews in Arabic by cell phone, explaining Israeli peace policies first to a Jordanian radio station and then to one from Qatar. Israel has never had such a diplomat, a Palestinian on its side. But as an integrationist, is he a part of the future or the past?</p>
        <p>Even if future Israeli-Arab leaders are as moderate and accommodating as Massalha, the external peace effort will still need to be followed by a parallel one inside. This is not to suggest that there will need to be a future Camp David with Azmi Bishara facing off against Jewish politicians from the Knesset cubicles next door. But what Israel calls ''the Palestinian problem'' cannot be cordoned off in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Many Palestinians are now and will forever remain Israelis.</p>
