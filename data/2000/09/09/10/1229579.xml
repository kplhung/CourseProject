        <p>John L Hochmann letter disputes Mario Vargas Llosa's August 13 dismissal of Manuel Puig, in Suzanne Jill Levine's biography Manuel Puig and the Spider Woman, as reader and writer (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mario Vargas Llosa is right to call ''Manuel Puig and the Spider Woman,'' a biography of Puig by Suzanne Jill Levine, whose literary agent I am, ''fascinating'' and ''indispensable for anyone interested in Puig's work'' (Aug. 13). But he is wrong in dismissing Puig as a reader and a writer.</p>
        <p>About reading, he says, ''Of all the writers I have known, the one who seemed least interested in literature was Manuel Puig,'' who ''never talked about authors or books.'' Every reader of Puig's ''Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' with its voluminous footnotes that he compiled himself from scholarly sources, knows how omnivorously he read.</p>
        <p>Vargas Llosa says, correctly, that Puig was obsessed with film. But he links this obsession to his complaint that Puig's novels represent ''an undemanding, pleasing literature that has no other purpose than to entertain.'' And yet Vargas Llosa astutely followed Puig's example when he wrote his best novel, ''Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter,'' around the subject of radio soaps, a genre conspicuously below the level of the kitschy movies he piously chastises Puig for cherishing. Amusingly, Puig did cast Vargas Llosa in a Hollywood pantheon. In her book, Levine reprints a chart Puig made in 1967, comparing 18 MGM actresses to Latin American authors. One goes: ''Esther Williams (Vargas Llosa) Oh so disciplined (and boring).'' Did Vargas Llosa's dismissive place in Puig's pantheon influence his dismissive view of Puig's novels?</p>
