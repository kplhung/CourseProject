        <p>THE ''City Beautiful'' movement was in full flower a century ago, and the architect Cass Gilbert (1859-1934) brought its ideals into tangible form. His United States Custom House on Bowling Green (shown above in a 1900 rendering) is a grand monument to New York's role in world trade. That celebrated structure and Gilbert's Gothic-styled Woolworth Building are among the subjects of an exhibition opening Tuesday at the New-York Historical Society, ''Inventing the Skyline: The Architecture of Cass Gilbert.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the show's sketches and photographs, there will be a series of free related public programs in October including a panel on architecture and public life, a symposium and panel on the New York skyline, and a walking tour of the Upper West Side. Though the programs are free, reservations are required.</p>
