        <p>A FAVORITE story of Joe T. Ford, chairman and chief executive of the Alltel Corporation, involves a real yet proverbial little old lady. He tells it to  every new group of employees.</p>
        <p>Back in 1948, Alltel, then known as Allied Telephone, bought a group of tiny independent phone companies in southwest Arkansas, including one in the hamlet of Amity. ''It had 200, maybe 250 customers,'' Mr. Ford recalled. It also had an employee named Edna Nunn, who, despite being restricted to a wheelchair by childhood polio, operated the company's manual switchboard, collected all its bills and handled customer complaints.</p>
        <p>Shortly after Mr. Ford became vice president and treasurer of Allied in 1963, he noticed something odd about the Amity operation. ''Every single bill was paid on time,'' he said. ''Same thing the second month. Now, that just doesn't happen.'' But it did happen again the month after that, so Mr. Ford drove out to Amity to get an  firsthand explanation from Ms. Nunn.</p>
        <p>''Well,'' she said bashfully, ''they'll all pay me back.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford uses the story to drive home a central tenet in his strategy -- that customer service translates into customer loyalty. From a small regional base, he has built a  communications empire around the idea, one whose modest national profile belies its size and reach. And if the concept is not necessarily original to Mr. Ford, well, ''I still want to convey that attitude,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On a recent Friday, however, Mr. Ford seemed equally eager to be conveyed to Scotland, to start a vacation with his wife after 14 breakneck months of acquisition and expansion at Alltel. The company now has 10 million communications customers in 24 states, making it the sixth-largest land-line phone company in the country and the fifth-largest wireless provider; nearly a million of those customers have been added since Mr. Ford's last vacation in June 1999 (golf in Pebble Beach, Calif.)</p>
        <p>Growth by accretion has been the rule  since Mr. Ford married the founder's daughter, Jo Ellen Wilbourn, and joined the company as an advertising salesman in 1959. That year, Allied Telephone reported a whopping $12,000 in profit.</p>
        <p>Through the 1960's and 1970's, most of the company's acquisitions were of small, independent operators in Arkansas and nearby states -- like the one that brought Edna Nunn onto the payroll. But that all changed in 1983 when Mr. Ford, by then a senior executive, helped engineer a transforming merger in which Allied effectively swallowed Mid-Continent Telephone of Canton, Ohio, a company four times its size, to form Alltel. Mr. Ford became president and chief executive in 1987 and chairman in 1991.</p>
        <p>More big deals followed, culminating in the $6 billion acquisition in 1998 of 360degrees Communications, a wireless operator based in Chicago with 2.6 million subscribers. A smaller deal last year -- $1.8 billion for Aliant Communications of Lincoln, Neb. -- brought the total number since Mr. Ford joined the company to more than 250.</p>
        <p>OTHER independent phone companies have also expanded by gobbling up their peers, large and small, but few have transformed their businesses quite as sweepingly. The 360degrees Communications deal was ''the seminal event for the company,'' said Eric Strumingher, a telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber, because it made Alltel as much a wireless company as a land-line phone utility; last year, wireless operations provided 42 percent of Alltel's $6.3 billion in revenue and 52 percent of its $1.62 billion in operating income.</p>
        <p>The two businesses are closely integrated. ''While others are talking about bundling of services and being a company that provides one-stop shopping, Alltel is, of all the large companies, the only one executing that strategy well,'' Mr. Strumingher said. ''There's no other company I know of at its size or larger that has completely torn down the structural barriers that exist between wireless and hard-line business.''</p>
        <p>The company's growth has not come cheaply. In some deals, Mr. Ford said in an interview, he has agreed to pay as much as $1,100 a customer -- a price that he regards as a sharp premium, but one that market conditions forced on him. ''Everything I've ever bought, I always thought I paid too much for,'' he said with a shrug.</p>
        <p>But the math has always turned out all right, he quickly added: ''We've worked through everything we've paid.''</p>
        <p>In contrast to giant rivals like the former Bell companies, which usually turn for capital to the big financial center banks and Wall Street houses, Alltel has financed much of its growth through a Little Rock neighbor that shares its tendency to fly under the radar of its rivals: Stephens Inc., the brokerage and investment banking firm. The Stephens Group, the family-owned parent holding company of Stephens, is also a major Alltel shareholder, with a stake valued at about $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford's personal ties to the Stephens family are three decades old; he and his wife are close friends of Jackson T. Stephens, chairman of Stephens, and Mr. Ford's youngest son, Scott, 38, worked for Stephens for a decade before becoming an executive at Alltel.</p>
        <p>The changing industry landscape has helped open the way for Alltel. ''Deregulation changed it all,'' Mr. Ford said. ''Competition replaces regulation.'' But he wondered whether the government's grip has relaxed enough. ''The F.C.C., to my mind, is still too much of a regulator,'' he said. ''They've been doing too much 'social' regulation as opposed to economic regulation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford's other main public policy concern is education. ''I think it's pretty serious when some youngster comes out of high school and really can't read or write,'' said Mr. Ford, whose father was a state education commissioner for many years. Without adequate schooling, he said, people cannot take full advantage of Internet access, a market he has positioned Alltel to penetrate, particularly through wireless services.</p>
        <p>''It's the thing that's out there,'' Mr. Ford said. ''I'm convinced people are going to be more on the go in the future than they have been in the past. They want access to information and we want to give it to them.''</p>
        <p>Analysts say Alltel took a big step toward that goal with a deal it struck earlier this year with Verizon Communications, swapping $600 million in cash and some of Alltel's wireless properties in the Midwest and Northeast for Verizon's in Ohio and in Sun Belt states from Arizona to Florida. Alltel gained 700,000 customers in the deal.</p>
        <p>Colette M. Fleming, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York, said the deal was shrewd for the company, even though by widening its service area it is increasing the proportion of its calling volume that will not generate roaming charges, the fees that callers pay when using their phones outside their own company's territory.</p>
        <p>''Any short-term hit they're taking in earnings due to reduced roaming revenues is necessary to position them for the long term,'' Ms. Fleming said.</p>
        <p>The company told analysts last Thursday that 2001 earnings would indeed fall short of the $3.26 a share that they had been expecting, and that $3 to $3.10 was more likely. But Bruce Behrens, who manages the Flag Investors Communication fund, said Alltel stock ''ought to be worth a lot more'' than the $51.75 it fetched on Friday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford will turn 65 in 2002, and expects to retire then. His son Scott, now chief operating officer, is widely seen as his heir apparent, but Mr. Ford deflects questions about succession, saying only, ''It's up to the board of directors.''</p>
        <p>For now, he is enjoying Alltel's success as much as ever. ''I think we've hit a stride,'' he said. ''I think it's just a matter of 'keep expanding, keep growing.' I get up every day looking forward to it.''</p>
