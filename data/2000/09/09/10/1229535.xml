        <p>Brad Isbister, the Islanders' lone remaining holdout now that Zdeno Chara has been locked out, has been given the same ultimatum Chara received: accept the team's final offer or sit out the season.</p>
        <p>''He has until Sunday,'' said General Manager Mike Milbury, who cut off talks with Chara on Friday, the first day of training camp. This is the way the team, under the new owners Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar, wants to do business, Milbury said. Isbister, who like Chara is a restricted free agent not eligible for arbitration, has been offered a two-year package worth $800,000, which his agent, Steve Reich, has termed unfair and unacceptable. Isbister, a 23-year-old forward who was second on the team in scoring with 22 goals and 42 points, earned $350,000 last year. The Islanders do not have to offer him any more than 10 percent over his base salary.</p>

        <p>Looking to replace Chara, the Islanders have offered a two-year, $1.95 million package to 37-year-old defenseman Garry Galley, an unrestricted free agent who spent last season with the Los Angeles Kings.</p>
