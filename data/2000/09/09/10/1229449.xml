      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Their voices cracking with outrage and disbelief, the parents gathered in a village farmhouse, chronicling four years of fear and frustration as they battle to keep their four sons from being executed for the killing of two taxi drivers six years ago.</p>
        <p>It is a tale that illustrates the pitfalls of China's criminal justice system and highlights the sometimes capricious imposition of the death sentence in a country that executes more prisoners each year than the rest of the world combined.</p>
        <p>Three times since 1996, the same local court has convicted a son from each of these four farming families of murder, and sentenced all of them to death. And three times, those convictions by the same three-judge panel were overturned on appeal. Effectively declaring the case to be hollow, the Hebei provincial high court cited credible evidence that the confessions were extracted by torture, potential witnesses were threatened by the police, exonerating records were suppressed and key forensic tests were crudely doctored.</p>
        <p>Yet the defendants -- two farmers, a truck driver and a factory welder whose ages range from 28 to 35 -- remain imprisoned in Chengde, a onetime imperial playground that is today a major tourist center. Sometime this fall, in an endless prosecution that shows both that the country is no longer a Communist monolith and that local authorities retain immense power, they are to be tried once more on the same charges, by the same local court, possibly to face another death sentence.</p>
        <p>The defendants have so far escaped execution only because their families -- all farmers and workers -- were willing to bear official persecution and severe financial strains to mount repeated legal appeals.</p>
        <p>Although three have been jailed for months at a time for, they were told, ''protecting criminals,'' several relatives of the defendants agreed to an interview. In a family home in the village of Zhuangtouying in a hillside tangle of vegetable gardens, chicken coops and simple brick houses, the parents could scarcely contain their rage and tears. ''We four families have protested and protested, but all we've ever met with from officials is curses and humiliation,'' said Yang Shuxia, the mother of a 28-year-old defendant, Zhu Yanqiang. ''Year after year, every month, every week, every moment, this has hung over us.''</p>
        <p>Wang Xioqin, the mother of Chen Guoqing, 30, another defendant, said:  ''These boys aren't the culprits. The authorities just picked on them because they think the common people won't fight back.''</p>
        <p>''In Chengde, the law enforcement officials just toy with common people's lives,'' added Ms. Wang, 52, her worn farmers' clothing smudged with mud.</p>
        <p>Violent or grossly unfair practices by the police, prosecutors and local courts are common in China, especially outside major cities. Cases of torture and wrongful imprisonment are increasingly reported in the controlled Chinese press, a sign that the central leadership feels it must acknowledge and attack a problem that for most Chinese is a more immediate human rights concern than any grand issue of democracy.</p>
        <p>The continued prosecution in Chengde is ''out of step with the demands of a society under the rule of law,'' a prominent Beijing attorney, Jiang Xiaoming, wrote in a Beijing newspaper in August.</p>
        <p>''Although the case in Chengde appears to be extreme, similar ones are quite common in China, and I don't mean just a handful of them,'' said Hu Yunteng, an authority on criminal procedure and the death penalty with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing as well as a practicing defense attorney.</p>
        <p>The number of executions in China is treated as a state secret, but according to incomplete numbers gleaned by Amnesty International from news accounts, close to 2,000 people have been put to death annually in recent years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hu said that despite major improvements in the criminal procedure code that took effect in 1997, important shortcomings remain,  such as a lack of protection from double jeopardy. More common threats to fairness include a traditional, widely shared assumption in China that ''if evidence points toward an individual, he must be guilty,'' Mr. Hu said. And in many localities, legal experts say, Communist Party officials, the police and prosecutors hold sway over the courts.</p>
        <p>''The public security organs can be very powerful,'' Mr. Hu said, ''and to their way of thinking, once they've expended so much time and energy on a case, if a verdict of innocence comes in, they find this very hard to accept.''</p>
        <p>The torture of defendants is not rare, many lawyers say, and is often overlooked by judges. In the Chengde case, interrogators applied an electric prod to one man's genitals, inserted an electrified wire into the anus of another and beat one of the men with an iron rod, according to  relatives and defense attorneys and the testimony of cellmates. Reached by telephone, two different Chengde police officials refused to comment on the torture charges.</p>
        <p>An unusual aspect of this case is the critical scrutiny it has received in newspapers outside of Hebei Province. The Aug. 10 issue of Southern Weekend, a nationally circulated newspaper published in Guangzhou, printed a detailed expose, including excerpts from the appeals court's description of glaring inconsistencies in the forensic evidence and of the alleged torture. Key tests of blood samples used to tie defendants to the killing, for example, were dated days before the men had even been detained, according to the court record.</p>
        <p>But few residents of Chengde have heard any of this: local media have not reported on the legal reversals and charges of official misconduct.</p>
        <p>Defending the prosecutions, an administrator of the Chengde intermediate court, where the convictions occurred, told Southern Weekend, ''This case can't be wrong.''</p>
        <p>Investigators had sometimes been careless with evidence, admitted the official, Miao Hongqing, but all the defendants had confessed, and the circumstantial evidence and blood tests all matched up. He accused the families of colluding to make up alibis.</p>
        <p>The four men only became suspects some three months after the killings of the taxi drivers, which to the embarrassment of the police had gone unsolved. According to the families, the police first picked up Mr. Chen on an unrelated matter.</p>
        <p>''It all started when the police accused Chen Guoqing of raping a girl from a street stall,'' said his mother, Ms. Wang. ''They fined him [the equivalent of $36] but he refused to pay, saying he was innocent. A few days later, he was taken away and tortured.''</p>
        <p>In police hands, Mr. Chen not only confessed to a role in the killings but implicated more than a dozen of his fellow villagers. Some have fled the area, and others were not prosecuted for unknown reasons.</p>
        <p>The relatives insist that the men have strong alibis.</p>
        <p>His family swears that Chen Guo qing, for example, was on duty at a local boiler plant during one of the killings. A defense attorney said that  factory records proving Mr. Chen's claim had been introduced at trial, but ignored by the judges.</p>
        <p>On one of the nights he is accused of committing murder, Zhu Yangqiang was at home in bed with an intravenous drip, on his second day of recovery from a street fight, according to his mother and neighbors. Ms. Wang said that clinic records of his medical treatment were seized by investigators, mentioned in the first trial to no effect and have not been produced since.</p>
        <p>Yang Wanying said his son, the defendant Yang Shiliang, 35, who is married with an 11-year-old boy, had high earnings driving a five-ton truck that the family had bought with pooled resources. His wife, father and father-in-law all had steady jobs with decent salaries.</p>
        <p>''With five breadwinners in the family we were earning a good living, so why should he ever murder anyone for money?'' Mr. Wang asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wang, who is 64, said he has been totally disillusioned by the conduct of the authorities. ''I'm quite old, and I've never heard of any rule of the Communist Party that allows for this sort of thing to happen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Fu Yiru, the mother of the fourth defendant, He Guoqiang, 28,said that once they heard their son was a suspect they urged him to turn himself in to clear his name, and he agreed. ''How we regret it now,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As it repeatedly overturned the convictions, the Hebei provincial high court declared, ''The facts are unclear and the evidence is insufficient.''</p>
        <p>In principle, this should lead to a presumption of innocence and the appeals court could have ordered the men released rather than giving local officials the option of a retrial.</p>
        <p>But, because of ingrained assumptions about guilt, personal and political ties between the courts and even concern about the lower court's possible financial liability for wrongful imprisonment, flawed cases are often sent back in this manner to the original venue, said Mr. Hu, the legal authority.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of criminal cases like this one, going back and forth like a Ping-Pong match,'' he said.</p>
