        <p>WHEN the New Rochelle Public Library began a collection documenting the history of the city's Mexican population, it had to be called the Antonio Valencia Local History Collection. There was really no other choice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valencia, 77, the first Mexican immigrant to New Rochelle, has spent decades helping others immigrate here, and his life is intertwined with the community's history. Indeed, many of the items in the collection so far were donated by him: photographs of families, a permit to work in the United States, a boarding pass from a flight from Mexico -- mementos and artifacts that trace the story of a community which has flourished over four decades.</p>
        <p>''What you see here is his,'' said Robin Osborne, who helped start the project, referring to Mr. Valencia. ''It traces how the migration began, how they established themselves.'' Ms. Osborne, the outreach services consultant for the Westchester Library System, received a $1,900 grant from the State Archives and Records Administration in 1999 to start the collection. She received another grant from the archives and records administration for $5,000.</p>
        <p>She met with Mr. Valencia, asking him for help, after receiving the first grant.</p>
        <p>''It was really a surprise to me,'' Mr. Valencia said. ''I was in Mexico, and one day they called me and said they needed pictures and things like that.''</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the library, he had saved not just pictures but letters, newspapers and other evidence of his work bringing whole families here from his home state of Michoacan, two and a half hours south of Guadalajara.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valencia immigrated in 1954 to work as a housekeeper for George Vergara, then a councilman, and his wife, Allys. Mr. Vergara would become Mayor of New Rochelle, and both would become lifelong friends of Mr. Valencia, who lived in their house until Ms. Vergara's death in 1998.</p>
        <p>Soon Mr. Valencia began to help others immigrate, many from his hometown of Cotija and the surrounding villages. ''We'd bring one member of a family,'' he said, ''and he'd bring a mother, a father, a brother.'' Other immigrants came on their own, some arriving with only a piece of paper with Mr. Valencia's name and phone number. He would help them find a job and a place to live.</p>
        <p>Today downtown New Rochelle is dotted with Mexican restaurants and shops. The 1990 census found that just under 4 percent of the city's population was of Mexican origin; library officials say they believe it is now around 15 percent.</p>
        <p>The library collection includes photographs of the first few families to come to New Rochelle, many of whom knew Mr. Valencia in Mexico. They are dressed in ties and jackets or long dresses and sit in restaurants, in churches and at people's homes. In June, the library presented a program on the collection, hoping to draw in more people and their memories.</p>
        <p>More than 200 people turned out, and about 20 families responded to surveys asking about family history. ''We need them to understand how important this is,'' said Billie Tucker, the community relations coordinator for the library. She said library staff members would begin calling those families this month, asking them to contribute items for the collection.</p>
        <p>Right now, Mr. Valencia's donations, along with several photographs from one woman who responded to the survey, are being cataloged, and descriptive texts are being written. Library officials would like to see more belongings that people brought from Mexico, but Ms. Osborne said that people aren't always willing to give up their personal remembrances. Most of all, she wants their stories.</p>
        <p>That is why the library has hired Roger Panetta, an associate professor of history at Marymount College. Dr. Panetta and his students will conduct interviews with Mexican families that will then be made available as transcripts or on videocassette. Dr. Panetta and his students completed a similar project in Sleepy Hollow in 1998.</p>
        <p>''The first families, they are really excited about it,'' Mr. Valencia said. ''One day they will have something to see there.''</p>
        <p>After a life spent helping others, Mr. Valencia, for lack of money, had to move to Connecticut, he said. He lives in a house provided him by an order of priests that was founded by a fellow Cotija native. He still commutes an hour almost every other day to New Rochelle to visit his friends, aid others and look at what he helped create.</p>
