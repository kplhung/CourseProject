        <p>September</p>
        <p>CHRISTINA AGUILERA  Armed with an Iberian surname and a pert image, Ms. Aguilera is poised to mop up the Latin record-buying market with ''Mi Reflejo,'' her second album -- a risky endeavor for someone who hasn't spoken Spanish much since her childhood. Her first album, ''Christina Aguilera,'' released a year ago, sold nearly 10 million worldwide. This time it may not matter if she sings in Catalan. Tuesday. RCA Victor.</p>

        <p>A * indicates an event of special note.</p>
        <p>September</p>
        <p>CHRISTINA AGUILERA  Armed with an Iberian surname and a pert image, Ms. Aguilera is poised to mop up the Latin record-buying market with ''Mi Reflejo,'' her second album -- a risky endeavor for someone who hasn't spoken Spanish much since her childhood. Her first album, ''Christina Aguilera,'' released a year ago, sold nearly 10 million worldwide. This time it may not matter if she sings in Catalan. Tuesday. RCA Victor.</p>
        <p>AT THE DRIVE-IN  It will be surprising if this earnest and furious Texas postpunk quintet rises above the underground college-rock circuit it seems built for, but the sound of its new album, ''Relationship of Command,'' is ready-for-prime-time; it's produced by Ross Robinson, who gave bands like Slipknot and Korn their overpowering sound. Tuesday. Grand Royal/Virgin.</p>
        <p>* ''THE BEST OF BROADSIDE 1962-1988''  A collection of songs published by Broadside -- a magazine of the folk movement, whose founders created recorded anthologies for the Folkways label -- comes at a time when we no longer know what the protest song is. One hopes this beautifully annotated five-CD set will lead to a resurgence of interest in Malvina Reynolds, the Cole Porter of striking workers; if not, the Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger and Lucinda Williams cuts should lure the already converted. Tuesday. Smithsonian/Folkways.</p>
        <p>* CAFE TACUBA  From Mexico City, this quartet is one of the great rock bands of our time and still unsuccessfully promoted in the United States, despite the fact that it has now made two records that could bear comparison to the Beatles' ''White Album.'' If you haven't heard ''Re'' or ''Reves/Yosoy,'' you're missing out. Tuesday and Wednesday. S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street  (212-243-4940).</p>
        <p>RACHELLE FERRELL  Ms. Ferrell is an absurdly talented singer, one who's able to assume many voices; pinning her down on record is difficult. But ''Individuality (Can I Be Me?)'' sounds assiduously worked on, and it's a sort of mainstream version of the moody, interior, becalmed funk direction Me'shell Ndegeocello has been heading in. Tuesday. Capitol.</p>
        <p>EMMYLOU HARRIS  ''Red Dirt Girl'' is her first album for a new label, Nonesuch, and the first time in a long while that she's written so much of her own music for a record; it's got a modern production sound, and that voice, hired for backup work by seemingly hundreds of aspirants in the Americana sweepstakes, is as moving as ever. Tuesday. Nonesuch. (She will perform on Sept. 18-20 at Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Fourth Street, 212-239-6200).</p>
        <p>RICKIE LEE JONES  On another career detour -- not that all of her career hasn't been a detour -- ''It's Like This'' tackles some of her favorite songs by other people, from Billy Strayhorn to Steve Winwood. Tuesday. Artemis.</p>
        <p>JOAN OSBORNE  Five years after ''One of Us,'' a hit that was a strange gift to Ms. Osborne in that it was thoroughly atypical of her blues-rock background, she has figured out her next move; it's called ''Righteous Love.'' Tuesday. Interscope. A related article is on page 86.</p>
        <p>MAGALI SOURIAU  ''Birdland Sessions,'' a long-overdue first recording, reveals one of the most original orchestral jazz composers of our time. This French pianist's travels have taken her through Marseille's conservatory, a scholarship at the Berklee School of Music in Boston and finally some gigs in New York these past few years, where the crowds have been small but the music astonishing. Tuesday. Koch.</p>
        <p>JULIETA VENEGAS  One of the new faces in Spanish-language rock, the Mexican Ms. Venegas, on ''Buen Invento,'' presents clever, direct songs and sings them forcefully, in a way that's earned her comparisons to Fiona Apple. Tuesday. BMG US/ Latin.</p>
        <p>PEARL JAM  A heavily bootlegged band strikes back with cheap and official live recordings: 25 double-disc live albums with sparse packaging, recorded and mixed by the band's engineer last summer while the band toured through Europe. Saturday. Epic. (Available on at the band's Web site, www.tenclub.net, for $10.98 plus shipping and handling.)</p>
        <p>BJORK  For her soundtrack to Lars Von Trier's ''Dancer in the Dark,'' she worked with the arranger Vince Mendoza -- who made Joni Mitchell's recent orchestral album sound grand and Hollywood-decorous -- and Mr. Von Trier's lyrics. ''Selmasongs'' isn't a full-fledged Bjork album per se, but her willful singing forces the picture, and the album, to bend around her. Sept. 19. Elektra.</p>
        <p>DAVE DOUGLAS QUARTET  The trumpeter is never at a loss for projects, and this one's workable: recently he's managed to lure compositions by the Dutch pianist Misha Mengelberg out of their hiding places -- some of them 40 years old. To make this week even more interesting, Mr. Douglas is also bringing Mr. Mengelberg's longtime colleague, the Dutch drummer Han Bennink, into his quartet.  Sept. 19-24. Iridium, 48 West 63rd Street (212-582-2121).</p>
        <p>MADONNA  ''Music'' is the latest chapter of her grown-up club-kid phase, with producers William Orbit and Mirwais. Sept. 19. Warner Brothers.</p>
        <p>WILLIE NELSON  Though one of his great early songs was called ''The Man With the Blues,'' this repository of American music has never recorded an actual blues album. ''Milk Cow Blues'' corrects that oversight. Sept. 19. Island.</p>
        <p>* DANILO PEREZ  The youngish pianist Mr. Perez has made, in ''Motherland,'' one of the most ambitious jazz records of the last decade. He's sought out the best of the new musicians and applied them to the two best concepts circulating through the jazz world right now: cultural pan-Americanism and the continuum between folk traditions and high art. Mr. Perez is enough of a scholar and certainly enough of a musician to pull it off. Sept. 19. Verve/Universal.</p>
        <p>* ''IN HER OWN RIGHT: THE LIFE AND MUSIC OF MARY LOU WILLIAMS''  Finally, one of the most inventive figures in jazz history -- look up her ''Zodiac Suite'' or some of the Andy Kirk music she arranged -- is getting her due: a solid biography, tribute albums and this combination of an exhibition and several concerts. The exhibition, opening on Sept. 19, has her manuscript scores, scrapbooks, paintings and correspondence; on Oct. 6, the pianist Geri Allen plays the music of Mary Lou Williams, and on Nov. 17, the Harlem Boys Choir performs some of the sacred work she composed toward the end of her life. All three at Flushing Town Hall, 137-35 Northern Boulevard, Queens (718-463-7700).</p>
        <p>LINCOLN CENTER JAZZ ORCHESTRA: ''BODY AND SOUL''  Part of both the New York Film Festival and Jazz at Lincoln Center's fall programs, this concert is the first major project by the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra's trombonist Wycliffe Gordon: he has composed a soundtrack to the 1925 Oscar Micheaux silent film ''Body and Soul,'' and it's a world premiere. Sept. 24. Avery Fisher Hall.</p>
        <p>ALLISON MOORER  This country singer is growing artistically and has become more direct than most of her peers; ''The Hardest Part,'' cleverly produced without trying to imitate a home recording, sounds leagues apart from the goody-goody female vocalists (not to mention the teenaged girl-groups) of commercial Nashville. Sept. 26. MCA Nashville. (Ms. Moorer performs on Oct. 17 at the Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, under Time Cafe 212-533-7000).</p>
        <p>PLENA LIBRE  Leading the movement to revive the African-influenced, century-old Puerto Rican dance rhythms and instrumental configuration called plena, this band radiates conviction in its driving orchestral arrangements; an album like ''Mas Libre,'' its sixth, is both post- and pre-salsa. Sept. 26. Ryko/Palm. (The group performs on Oct. 6 at Symphony Space.)</p>
        <p>SHYNE  He's a Belizean MC by way of Brooklyn, Puffy Combs's new signing; advance reports say that rhythmically there's a dancehall tinge here that sets it apart from the usual run of East Coast hip-hop. Sept. 26. Bad Boy/Arista.</p>
        <p>October</p>
        <p>''CALYPSO AWAKENING: FROM THE EMOERY COOK COLLECTION''  Emory Cook recorded calypsonians in Trinidad -- including famous ones like Mighty Sparrow and Lord Melody, and others you haven't heard of -- and he was intent on getting the interplay between musicians and audience. These recordings, made between 1956 and 1962, are some of the results. Oct. 3. Smithsonian/Folkways.</p>
        <p>GURU  ''Guru's Jazzmatazz: Streetsoul'' is another installment in the Gang Starr rapper's quest for that impossible dream: a jazz-hip-hop mixture. Settling for some jazz chords over the new, relaxed R-and-B style, he's collaborated here with most of the stars of the alternative soul movement, including Macy Gray, Erykah Badu, Angie Stone and Bilal. Oct. 3. Virgin.</p>
        <p>* RADIOHEAD  A few years ago, when critics started talking about the death of the Great Rock Band as a commonplace, this was one of the few groups one could reasonably come up with to refute the argument. ''Kid A'' will be their successor to ''OK Computer,'' which made art-rock safe for kids again. Oct. 3. Capitol.</p>
        <p>PAUL SIMON  ''You're the One'' is a return to his singer-songwriter form before the days of grappling with African-diaspora music and theater. Oct. 3. Warner Brothers.</p>
        <p>THE WHO/JIMMY PAGE AND THE BLACK CROWES  This four-night pairing at the Garden by a hoary oldies band and a group classically trained in the dynamics of late-60's rock suggests -- if not quite proves -- that classic rock isn't actually dead. Oct. 3, 4, 6 and 7. Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>RAVI AND ANOUSHKA SHANKAR  It's been clear for some time that Mr. Shankar's daughter Anoushka was a serious talent on the sitar, and their concerts together have generally risen above extended lessons, which is something that master-and-protege concerts in Indian music can easily become. Oct. 6. Carnegie Hall.</p>
        <p>PHIL LESH AND FRIENDS  The bassist Mr. Lesh has split off from the rest of the Grateful Dead's former members and created a touring band that builds on the Dead's tumbling countermelodies and rhythms and sounds like a glorious tangle of collective improvising; it's composed of musicians who grew up on the Dead's music, and Mr. Lesh likes to invite jazz musicians on stage with them.  Oct. 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16. Beacon Theater, Broadway and 74th Street (212-496-7070).</p>
        <p>GODSPEED YOU BLACK EMPEROR!  There are so many members of this Montreal instrumental rock band that they barely fit on the stages of the small clubs they play in; with scrappy avant-garde films running behind them and field recordings of religious proselytizers threading through their constant crescendos, they seem like uber-Bohemians, horrified and fascinated by life in the material world.  ''Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven,'' a double-disc album, comes after extensive touring; the band is sounding good these days. Oct. 10. Kranky.</p>
        <p>THE SEA AND CAKE  These staunch do-it-yourselfers from Chicago's new art-rock scene make prettier and prettier records on small budgets; ''Oui'' is the best yet, graceful guitar pop guided by Sam Prekop's airy vocals. Oct. 10. Thrill Jockey.</p>
        <p>TITAN  A mostly electronic band from Mexico City, this trio of kitsch-hounds play humorously off Mexican film stereotypes and, with the help of the Californian production team known as Sukia, have made a funky, weird, constantly surprising dance floor record. Oct. 10. Virgin.</p>
        <p>WALLFLOWERS  With ''Breach'' comes more straight-faced roots-rock from Jakob Dylan et al. Oct. 10. Interscope.</p>
        <p>LIMP BIZKIT  With the worst album title in recent memory, ''Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water,'' Limp Bizkit's new album will drop on an entire nation of white rap-metal teenagers that have, somehow, raised the band's singer, Fred Durst, to the level of true-blue cultural hero. How did the group get from being a prank band, emerging from a giant toilet onstage, to its current position? Oct. 17. Interscope.</p>
        <p>''HEART AND SOUL: THE MUSIC OF FRANK LOESSER''  Directed by Gabriel Barre with musical direction by Eric Stern, these evenings feature songs from ''Guys and Dolls,''  ''The Most Happy Fella'' and other shows. Oct. 20-21. Alice Tully Hall.</p>
        <p>MEDESKI, MARTIN AND WOOD  This trio can't tour or record enough: they're young, ambitious musicians equally amenable to thick funk grooves (which is what kids want) and freer, acoustic post-Ornette jazz (which is what they want kids to want). ''The Dropper'' contains enough overdriven Hammond organ to fry a hamburger, as well as electronics, tapes run backward and James Brown beats galore. Oct. 24. Blue Note/Capitol.</p>
        <p>''THE COMPLETE CHARLIE PARKER SAVOY AND DIAL STUDIO RECORDINGS''  Starting with the alto saxophonist's first recordings as a bandleader in 1945, this remastered eight-CD set contains some of the most electrifying and terrifying small-group jazz; even today, three generations of musicians are still poring over it. Oct. 24. Savoy.</p>
        <p>PJ HARVEY  ''Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea'' continues Polly Harvey's secure formula -- slow, raging-sea-of-the-mind vignettes, this time more inspired by Patti Smith than ever. Ms. Harvey may be drone-rock's queen bee, but she's still not part of any movement.  Oct. 24. Island.</p>
        <p>''HARLEM RENAISSANCE''  A concert of music connected to the Harlem Renaissance, including a reading of Langston Hughes's poetry with the musical accompaniment of the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, led by Jon Faddis; and songs associated with the singers Florence Mills and Adelaide Hall, performed by the guest musician Bobby Short. Oct. 26. Carnegie Hall.</p>
        <p>OUTKAST  This Atlanta hip-hop duo resists easy definition, and ''Stankonia'' leads Outkast's audience one further step into the unknown: it's a collision of Parliament's street-corner-Martian aesthetic and deep funk (as played by real instruments), and the parts of commercial hiphop you're familiar with -- bragging, self-defence, etc. Oct. 28. LaFace/Arista.</p>
        <p>* ERYKAH BADU  ''Mama's Gun'' is her first report from the studio since 1997's ''Baduizm,'' and it feels like black pop has gone through 15 revolutions since then. The album is crafted by the same team of musicians and producers that helped make D'Angelo's ''Voodoo'' -- easily one of the best albums this year. Oct. 31. Motown/Universal.</p>
        <p>U2  Still untitled, the Dublin band's new album, produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno. Oct. 31. Interscope.</p>
        <p>November</p>
        <p>DON BYRON  A commission from the newly re-energized Symphony Space, and a typical project from Mr. Byron, who loves provoking audiences and challenging their sense of retail-constructed genre. With a nonet, he's paying tribute to two of his idols: Henry Mancini and Sly Stone, who, as he doubtless will prove, have more in common than you might think. Nov. 3. Symphony Space.</p>
        <p>''AS OF NOW: SAM RIVERS AND ERIC REED''  A bill split between the young pianist and the old, perpetually vanguardist saxophone player: Mr. Reed's program will include ''The Word of God,'' a large work featuring the singer Roberta Gumbel with gospel choir, rhythm section and soloists; Mr. Rivers will bring his big band from Florida, performing a set of all original pieces, one of them new. Nov. 3-4. Jazz at Lincoln Center, Alice Tully Hall.</p>
        <p>ORQUESTA ARAGON  The great dynastic band of Cuban charanga music, around in one form or another for the last 60 years, Orquesta Aragon still puts on an energetic live show, intent on making the audiences stand and scream. Nov. 5. Symphony Space.</p>
        <p>BILL CHARLAP  The major labels in jazz seem to have no more room for another piano player -- they're looking for female singers. But as ''Written in the Stars'' shows, this young one jumped from a low-visibility independent to Blue Note on the old-fashioned merits of his Tommy Flanagan-style concision and harmonic acuity, as well as a trunkload full of forgotten musical-theater songs. Nov. 7. Blue Note/EMI. (Mr. Charlap's trio plays Nov. 14-19 at the Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street 212-255-4037).</p>
        <p>GINUWINE  He's very much in line with Usher, R. Kelly and a bunch of other current R-and-B sex symbols, but Ginuwine's comedic edge -- and, even more than that, his production agreement with the great Timbaland -- makes his records much more worth listening to. He's reaching wide with ''The Story,'' his third album: it is rumored to include a track written by Diane Warren, the queen of platinum-plated emotional schmaltz. Nov. 7. Epic 550/Sony.</p>
        <p>JENIFER LOPEZ  Rodney Jerkins is said to be among the battery of producers on ''A Passionate Journey,'' which can't miss commercially. Nov. 7. Epic/Sony.</p>
        <p>* CRYSTAL SIERRA  The young Baltimorean's first album is a really good stab at Afro-Latin teen-pop, shrewd as anything you've ever heard, that spreads its net wide with salsa trombones, TLC-style vocals sung in Spanglish, and state-of-the-art R-and-B beats. Nov. 7. Virgin.</p>
        <p>SADE  The arrival of ''Lovers Rock'' -- Sade's first new record in eight years -- means that smooth-jazz stations across the country will overhaul their playlist accordingly. Nov. 14. Epic.</p>
        <p>YOUSSOU N'DOUR  The just released ''Joko (The Link)'' is the Senegalese singer-songwriter's first American album in six years; it firmly pushes him into the headwaters of current pop and the new electronic music, as well as using Cuban and Caribbean rhythms. He will perform on Nov. 19 at Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Fourth Street (212-239-6200), and on Nov. 23 at the Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street (212-564-4882).</p>
        <p>WU-TANG CLAN  Over the last few years it looked as if the Staten Island hip-hop crew might entirely drown in its members' side projects, some of which have been dreadful; if the group's latest project, ''The W,'' is a solid album of tag-team rapping, it could restore its place. Nov. 21. Loud/RCA.</p>
        <p>TENACIOUS D  If you didn't see the short comic films by these two actor-musician galoots -- sneaked into HBO's late-night programming two years ago -- you missed some very funny riffing on one idea: dead-end losers who deeply believe themselves to be the thunder-bringing lords of a new, radical rock-folk-hip-hop vision. ''The Greatest Band on Earth,'' they called themselves in the films, while playing to an empty barroom on open-mike night. A year later, they were a real band, selling out mid-size rock clubs and looking surprised as the crowd sang every hilarious line. Nov. 28. Epic.</p>
        <p>December</p>
        <p>''HEIRS TO THE THRONE: MASTERS PLAY ARMSTRONG''  The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra plays Louis Armstrong music from all different eras, some of it in the company of guests like Bob Wilber (in the Sidney Bechet role of the Bechet/ Armstrong recordings) and some impressive young trumpeters who performed in Jazz at Lincoln Center's Essentially Ellington big-band competition.  Dec 7, 9, 13, Alice Tully Hall; on Dec. 8, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra will play an ''Armstrong for Dancers'' program at the Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street (212-875-5299).</p>
        <p>METHOD MAN  The Paul McCartney of the Wu-Tang Clan -- a dogged crowd-pleaser with a strong solo-album track record --  keeps turning out the mainstream hip-hop; his next, as-yet-untitled record will come out while Christmas wallets are open Dec. 19. Def Jam.</p>
        <p>January</p>
        <p>* BILAL  The first record by this Philadelphian-turned New York singer who's barely out of his teens has a deafening advance press: it's said that he's the next step in R-and-B, a talented singer-musician who's been through both the church choir and jazz studies and is coming in the music business through hip-hop's door. January. Interscope.</p>
        <p>* ''EVOLUTION -- THE MUSIC OF JOHN LEWIS''  The pianist of the former Modern Jazz Quartet and one of the most original jazz musicians ever has a night to himself, courtesy of Jazz at Lincoln Center, focusing on his compositions: quartets, duets (the M.J.Q. bassist Percy Hearth will be on hand) and orchestral pieces. Jan. 18 and 20. Alice Tully Hall.</p>
        <p>February</p>
        <p>BLIND BOYS OF ALABAMA  Led by Clarence Fountain, the elder statesmen of black American gospel music -- professional for more than 60 years, always with extravagant vocal techniques -- return to New York. Feb. 3. Symphony Space.</p>
        <p>DIANNE REEVES  She's certainly one of the most accomplished singers to come along in jazz since Sarah Vaughan, and this Valentine's Day concert with a string orchestra ought to be a popular idea for a date. Feb. 14. Avery Fisher Hall.</p>
        <p>ETHAN IVERSON  This jazz pianist works in a number of different contexts -- in straight, hard-swinging small groups, as an accompanist to the Mark Morris dance company, and in rather ingenious solo recitals, which in the past have intelligently reworked old American songs like ''I've Been Working on the Railroad.'' Feb. 21. Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall.</p>
        <p>March</p>
        <p>''WALL TO WALL MILES DAVIS''  A 12-hour marathon of Milesiana, played by a cast of musicians as yet unannounced -- touching on all his various periods. Admission will be free. March 24, noon to midnight. Symphony Space.</p>
        <p>April</p>
        <p>* MARCUS ROBERTS  The major New York concert hall debut of this jazz pianist as a solo performer. He takes a fearless and scientific approach to exploring rhythm; it seems likely that the concert will resemble his recent Lincoln Center solo performances, which approached jazz and blues historically, jumping from style to style. April 6. Avery Fisher Hall.</p>
