        <p>He had absorbed knee-wobbling hits on nearly every play as he led ground-pounding scoring drives that were as painful to watch for Notre Dame fans as a dentist's drill is to hear. He displayed his sprinter's speed and vanished 62 yards and into the end zone. So everyone, an awful lot of them in Nebraska red, in sold-out Notre Dame Stadium knew as overtime started today that the Cornhuskers were going to win or lose with their quarterback, Eric Crouch.</p>
        <p>Win the No. 1-ranked Huskers did, 27-24, in overtime. Thanks to Crouch.</p>
        <p>The Fighting Irish, ranked 23rd, had just taken a 24-21 lead after an improbable second-half comeback when Nick Setta kicked a 29-yard field goal. Now the Huskers were in trouble on third-and-9 on their 24-yard line. Crouch had attempted only 14 passes on the day, completing 7 of them.</p>
        <p>Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie believed that Crouch would run, so he did not blitz. Perhaps he should have, because Crouch passed -- to tight end Tracey Wistrom for the 9 yards and the first down.</p>
        <p>''It was a big down and it was kind of weird,'' Crouch said. ''I read Tracey's eyes as he went inside.''</p>
        <p>But what he thought next was better. After I-back Dan Alexander banged 8 more yards to the Notre Dame 7, Crouch knew it was time to call his own number. He rolled left on the option, no back trailing him, and sprinted to the corner of the end zone. It was over.</p>
        <p>For once, a game matched the buildup as two storied programs played on the grounds that spawned Rockne and the Four Horsemen and a nation-topping eight victories over No. 1-ranked teams. Crouch was aware of the history, but he wanted it to come out differently this time.</p>
        <p>''Everything was racing through my mind,'' Crouch said after a game in which he gained 80 yards on the ground, threw for 103 and scored 3 touchdowns. ''You want to get over the goal line. I saw daylight, the crowd was going crazy, the only option was for me to run, and we get out of this place with a victory.''</p>
        <p>It was the first time Nebraska had visited South Bend since 1947, and at least 30,000 of their red-clad fans came with them. Though just 4,000 tickets were allotted to Nebraska fans, the ribbons of red that bled through the crowd of 80,232 showed that most of them found tickets at prices ranging from $600 to $2,000. The Big Red infiltration did not go unnoticed by the new Notre Dame athletics director, Kevin White.</p>
        <p>''I wish I was colorblind,'' White said. ''I'm very disappointed.''</p>
        <p>No one really believed overtime was in the offing when, early in the third quarter, Alexander thundered through the Irish line and 28 yards into the end zone for a touchdown to give Nebraska a 21-7 lead. At that point, the Cornhuskers had gained 200 yards on the ground on their way to generating 377 yards of total offense. On another day, that would be enough to produce an easy victory.</p>
        <p>But on the ensuing kickoff, Julius Jones stirred up the echoes of the Irish mystique, the intangible that had been responsible for big upsets like the 1993 victory over No. 1 Florida State. In the first half, he had returned a kick 45 yards that was a shoelace tackle away from a touchdown.</p>
        <p>This time, with the same return play on, no one touched Jones as he zipped 100 yards up the left sideline for a touchdown to narrow the score to 21-14.</p>
        <p>''You get a couple of blocks and that's all it takes,'' said Jones, who also rushed for 52 yards at tailback.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Notre Dame found new energy, especially on defense. The Irish stopped the Cornhuskers on two consecutive drives, and then it was time for another return specialist to go to work. Joey Getherall gathered Dan Hadenfeldt's punt against his chest at his 17-yard line, bolted right past Justin Smith and looked as if he had a pretty good return. At midfield, he turned inside looking for a few extra yards. He not only found them, but all that stood in the way of him and the Nebraska end zone was the punter. Getherall feigned left, Hadenfeldt fell right and the Irish had their second return for a touchdown in less than 10 minutes. With 12 minutes 48 seconds remaining in regulation, they also had a tie score.</p>
        <p>''Not once from then on did we think we would not win this game,'' Davie said. ''Our defense kept getting stronger and we kept getting the huge plays.''</p>
        <p>Nebraska Coach Frank Solich felt the swing, too.</p>
        <p>''There was a stretch when we were moving the ball on the ground,'' he said. ''It came and went.''</p>
        <p>But the Irish offense was also sputtering, especially quarterback Arnaz Battle, who scrambled for 107 yards but barely got the ball in the air, completing only 3 of 15 attempts for 40 yards.</p>
        <p>Still, the Irish put together one last drive of 48 yards to the Nebraska 30. On fourth-and-1, the Irish went for it. Battle drifted right and tried to hit tight end Dan O'Leary, who was open in the middle of the field, but the pass sailed over his head.</p>
        <p>''We tried to go for it all,'' Davie said. ''We thought it was the right decision at the time.''</p>
        <p>By overtime, the Nebraska decision was to put the ball in Crouch's hands -- something Solich says he will do often this season as his Cornhuskers try to persevere all the way to the national title game.</p>
        <p>''Eric never gets excited,'' Solich said. ''You can count on him to make the big play. When you put the ball in Eric's hand down the stretch, you got a better chance of getting done.''</p>
        <p>He got it done.</p>
