        <p>RIDERS of the Long Island Rail Road have a lot to say about cell phone users on the trains. Not since smokers were banned in 1988 has a group incurred such wrath from fellow commuters.</p>
        <p>The main complaint is noise. Ringing phones, many of them programmed to play digital Bach, ''Yankee Doodle Dandy'' or the theme from ''Star Wars,'' jar many sleeping passengers awake.</p>
        <p>And commuters object to cell phone users who speak too loudly or too long.</p>
        <p>A commuter on the L.I.R.R. for 24 years, Shelly Cohen had a disturbing ride on a recent trip home from Manhattan to Cold Spring Harbor. ''From New Hyde Park to Cold Spring Harbor, a woman was talking to her office loudly on the phone,'' he said. ''I just had a long day. I don't want to hear somebody else's business. You can't be speaking to somebody for a half-hour on the train.''</p>
        <p>Normally concerned with things like air-conditioning, punctuality and the cleanliness of train cars, the L.I.R.R. Commuters Council, the railroad's official watchdog group, included questions about cell phone use in its most recent survey. More than 2,000 riders were asked if they preferred banning cell phones altogether, limiting cell phone use to certain cars, limiting call duration or educating users on cell phone etiquette. Although the results will not be published until October, the council's chairman, Larry Silverman, said ''a clear majority'' of the 400 surveys he collected favored education.</p>
        <p>''We've been on this issue for a while,'' said Mr. Silverman, who often uses his cell phone during his commute.</p>
        <p>Many people who use cell phones on the train would not want to be without them. Scott Starr, another Cold Spring Harbor resident, was waiting for The Call when his wife was expecting the couple's second child a few weeks ago. ''Having the phone on the train was important,'' he said recently, while riding on the railroad's main line. ''There wasn't much I could do from here, but at least I could make some calls if she needed help.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverman said complaints to the group about cell phone use were increasing, and most called attention to the volume of conversations.</p>
        <p>''Whether they are on a phone or speaking too loudly in person, I think that's being discourteous to riders around them,'' Mr. Silverman said. ''You don't have to shout to be heard. If you have to use the phone you can move to the vestibule.''</p>
        <p>Some said the root of the problem was lack of consideration. ''I have nothing against cell phones,'' said one rider on his morning commute. ''If someone chewed their gum too loud it would bother me, too.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, the council organized a cartoon contest on customer courtesy, and one of the winning entries, depicting a grinning cell phone, was supposed to become a public service advertisement in summer 1999. ''We went to the railroad to put up the ad. They refused,'' Mr. Silverman said. But he said the Ploughshare Group, an advertising agency, was working on a new ad that would remind cell phone users to mind their manners.</p>
        <p>''The railroad should help us promote consideration,'' said Mr. Silverman, who will again ask the railroad to contribute to the campaign.</p>
        <p>A railroad spokesman, Brian Dolan, said: ''We haven't been asked. If a request does come in, we'll evaluate it on its merit.''</p>
        <p>The problem is not confined to the L.I.R.R. A Metro-North spokesman, Dan Brucker, said complaints about cell phone use on its trains had been ''growing exponentially.'' He said, ''We have asked our customers via our newsletter if they would speak quietly into the phone and use their phones in the vestibule.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brucker said he had heard that one rider had come up with a novel challenge to a loud cell phone user.</p>
        <p>''There was this attorney on the train shouting on a cell phone and the man next to him asked him to speak lower,'' Mr. Brucker said. ''The attorney refused, so the guy took out one of those little tape recorders and said, 'There's the end of your attorney-client privilege.' The attorney got off the phone.''</p>
        <p>Some take a different tack. ''When my buddies and I see someone talking loud on a cell phone, we just talk louder,'' said Harold Huron of Little Neck, who rides the Port Washington branch to his job in New York City.</p>
        <p>Such tactics can be confrontational, but the Metropolitan Transportation Authority police say they know of no violent incidents involving cell phone users and other L.I.R.R. riders.</p>
        <p>Evening rush hours, when cars are packed and commuters are tired and short-tempered, are prime time for cell phone activity. When a phone rings, riders begin rummaging through their pockets and bags, not sure whose phone is ringing. And when a train comes to an abrupt stop between stations and the dreaded words ''Conductor go to Channel 4'' are broadcast over the public address system, riders instinctively reach for their phones to give warning that they are being delayed.</p>
        <p>Some L.I.R.R. riders can make calls on some trains using a public phone. The railroad's new double-decker cars have pay cell phones not unlike those on airplanes, although a railroad official said she did not think they were getting much use because ''everybody has their own cell phones.''</p>
        <p>There are more than 101 million wireless phone subscribers in the United States, with more than 45,000 new subscribers every day, according to the Cellular Phone Industry Association, a trade group. With so many people talking wherever they happen to be, odds are other people will be hearing phone conversations, whether they want to or not.</p>
        <p>Last year, San Diego conducted an online poll and found considerable support for restricting cell phone use in public places. Some restaurants have banned cell phone use, so other diners will not be disturbed. Several municipalities restrict cell phone use in cars for safety reasons. A similar bill was recently introduced in the Suffolk County Legislature.</p>
        <p>The L.I.R.R. said in a statement that it was not considering a cell phone ban, but suggested that its customers ''be considerate of their fellow travelers by using cell phones when necessary and in the least obtrusive way possible.''</p>
        <p>Any regulations on cell phone use would be difficult to enforce, Mr. Brucker said. ''You're getting into a very tough situation here,'' he said. So far, train conductors have stayed above the fray.</p>
        <p>''They post signs about loud music,'' said Mr. Cohen, the Cold Spring Harbor commuter, who has owned cell phones before but does not have one now. ''I think they should have signs to tell people to keep their voices down.''</p>
        <p>But he expects that some cell phone users will probably ignore efforts to silence them. ''A lot of the people who use them are just rude and inconsiderate,'' he said. ''I would bet that they also smoke in restaurants.''</p>
