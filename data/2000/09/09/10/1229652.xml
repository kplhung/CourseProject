        <p>Interview with film director Neil Labute, who comments on his production company, Contemptible Entertainment and new project, Nurse Betty; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Q: Your production company is called Contemptible Entertainment. Why?</p>
        <p>I thought it was vaguely ominous and Victorian. And also, more specifically, it was based on a film I like a great deal, Godard's ''Contempt.''</p>
        <p>But of course it also suggests the nastiness of your first two movies, ''Your Friends and Neighbors'' and ''In the Company of Men,'' which was about some men who plot to seduce and abandon a deaf woman. Were you surprised that to some people the movie wasn't just a depiction of misogyny but also an act of misogyny in its own right?</p>

        <p>Q: Your production company is called Contemptible Entertainment. Why?</p>
        <p>I thought it was vaguely ominous and Victorian. And also, more specifically, it was based on a film I like a great deal, Godard's ''Contempt.''</p>
        <p>But of course it also suggests the nastiness of your first two movies, ''Your Friends and Neighbors'' and ''In the Company of Men,'' which was about some men who plot to seduce and abandon a deaf woman. Were you surprised that to some people the movie wasn't just a depiction of misogyny but also an act of misogyny in its own right?</p>
        <p>On the one side, I had to look at critics and praise them for keeping their mouths shut about the twists and turns that the screenplay takes. On the other side, because the inciting incident sounds so misogynistic, I think it did mislead a lot of people into thinking: ''Gosh, I don't really know if I want to spend $8 on that. I'm brutalized on a daily basis; I'm not sure I want to go pay for it.'' I used as many techniques as I could to keep you distanced. The kinds of things that are often used to lead an audience along -- We think you should be feeling weepy right now, so we're putting in the music that accompanies that'' -- I tried to stay very clear of that sort of thing. But I think any response was fairly valid, and for me, I would much rather have a negative response than no response at all.</p>
        <p>Isn't it disturbing that the response might in fact be too positive?</p>
        <p>Oh, sure. One of the worst experiences I had was watching ''Your Friends and Neighbors,'' when the character that I probably like the most, Catherine Keener's character, who never really did anything that seemed to be mean-spirited, was confronted by Jason Patric, and he reads her the riot act and leaves her all teary. The audience I saw it with cheered. So there is that danger.</p>
        <p>Where does your interest in the darker side of the male character originate?</p>
        <p>I've grown up around men who have been quite difficult, and so I cast sort of a jaundiced eye at them and at the capability that they have for doing ill. But, you know, I can't narrow it down to one person that drives me to do what I do. I don't think it's something that comes from childhood, or comes from my father, or from being a Mormon, or from being a man. I think it's simply the interest as a storyteller of taking an audience and feeling a commitment not to bore them with the material they've seen before.</p>
        <p>So the darkness depicted is not the product of your own dark and evil fantasy?</p>
        <p>If one spilled too much light on it, it wouldn't remain dark, would it? I think it's a mistake to dig too deeply into why. The treat lies in the creation and in setting the work out there, not in trying to scrape back those things to see their origins in the author. The chill and the surprise and the ecstasy come from the piece, not from solving the riddle of the writer himself. And it's also like that wonderful quote of Beckett's, when he was asked either about his entire canon or ''Waiting for Godot.'' I forget which it was, but he was asked, basically, ''Well, what's this about?'' And he said: ''Why ask me? I wrote it.''</p>
        <p>By comparison, your new movie, ''Nurse Betty,'' is downright cheerful. Why did you pick this script?</p>
        <p>I couldn't imagine myself writing it, and no one would suspect me of directing it. I thought that was probably a pretty good reason to go do it. And there was a kind of playground mentality as well, where I said I don't want anybody else to get this, so I'm going to take it and run. I had never really approached anything before this where I worried if an audience cared for a character. When people would say, ''Who am I supposed to like?'' I would think, ''Like your friends.'' With this movie, the audience does have to care for the main character; they do have to want her to make it through the maze of the story. It's really a love story about somebody falling for themselves.</p>
        <p>Which is a very happy ending. Maybe you'll have to rename Contemptible Entertainment.</p>
        <p>That's a frightening possibility. And a hopeful one.</p>
        <p>-- Mim Udovitch</p>
