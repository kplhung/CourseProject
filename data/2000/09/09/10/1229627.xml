        <p>It's a construction site on Greene Street in SoHo. Yet another gallery giving way to a face-paint emporium, you think, until you see the slick black letters on white background: ''Helmut Lang.'' Such is the power of the name of this designer of lean, clean apparel that suddenly even the cement-crusted wheelbarrows stacked at the entrance acquire a Duchampian significance. On Aug. 1 there are plywood sheets laid over floor joists. By late September, there will be a concrete floor, white walls and a long black counter, as Lang's ''house for perfume,'' as he calls it, opens directly across the street from his clothing store. Marching along that counter will be high-shouldered bottles of perfume, cologne and after-shave. Two floors of prime retail space devoted to two fragrances -- and there won't even be bath beads or scented candles! There will be, however, a large white pill in a metal box, something that might be called a room freshener if it weren't found in such haute surroundings.</p>
        <p>Since in the fashion world Lang is renowned for coming first to ideas that quickly seem inevitable (like the ubiquitous flat-front trouser), it is entirely possible that the store that appears to be offering nothing but perfumed air under 20-foot ceilings is actually heralding a seismic shift in the selling of beauty -- the coming of conceptual cosmetics.</p>

        <p>It's a construction site on Greene Street in SoHo. Yet another gallery giving way to a face-paint emporium, you think, until you see the slick black letters on white background: ''Helmut Lang.'' Such is the power of the name of this designer of lean, clean apparel that suddenly even the cement-crusted wheelbarrows stacked at the entrance acquire a Duchampian significance. On Aug. 1 there are plywood sheets laid over floor joists. By late September, there will be a concrete floor, white walls and a long black counter, as Lang's ''house for perfume,'' as he calls it, opens directly across the street from his clothing store. Marching along that counter will be high-shouldered bottles of perfume, cologne and after-shave. Two floors of prime retail space devoted to two fragrances -- and there won't even be bath beads or scented candles! There will be, however, a large white pill in a metal box, something that might be called a room freshener if it weren't found in such haute surroundings.</p>
        <p>Since in the fashion world Lang is renowned for coming first to ideas that quickly seem inevitable (like the ubiquitous flat-front trouser), it is entirely possible that the store that appears to be offering nothing but perfumed air under 20-foot ceilings is actually heralding a seismic shift in the selling of beauty -- the coming of conceptual cosmetics.</p>
        <p>Brand has always been important in an industry where cost of ingredients bears only a loose relationship to retail price, but in conceptual cosmetics The Name is all. Helmut Lang fragrances were introduced in May with ads free of descriptive copy or metaphorical imagery -- no hint that one fragrance is masculine, one feminine; no models writhing in heat or walking on the beach -- nothing to distract from the naked power of The Name.</p>
        <p>Obeying the precept that the value of a product increases with the difficulty of finding it, Lang began by selling his fragrances in the U.S. only at his SoHo store. He then gave the rule a stunning twist by offering the fragrances over the Internet. (Devotees bought without so much as sniffing a scent strip.) From the laboratory in the basement of the Greene Street perfumery there will issue a trickle of new products like essential oils -- very pure, not available elsewhere,'' says the 44-year-old designer in a soft Austrian accent.</p>
        <p>For several years purveyors of high-end beauty have been in thrall to the belief that customers want to grab and pay with minimal input from sales personnel, exactly as they might at a drugstore. Lang, grasping the fallacy of this theory (then why not go to a drugstore?) sees clients and staff members circulating on both sides of the counter, engaging in ''conversations.'' He wants the store to be ''like an old-fashioned perfumery,'' dedicated to ''personal service in reaction to globalization.'' Jenny Holzer's electronic text will run along the length of the store, in accordance with another tenet of conceptual cosmetics: product will be displayed as art. The space, designed by Richard Gluckman (who also designed the Dia Center for the Arts), will have the minimalist cool of an installation.</p>
        <p>Miuccia Prada, who took her family's stuffy luggage company and turned it into a fashion leader, is also entering the beauty industry. Although she is beginning with skin care, not fragrance, she, too, is dedicated to the principles of conceptual cosmetics. Items will be hard to find. Starting next month, the line will be offered only at certain Prada, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue locations. Here, too, product will be regarded as art. Selling areas are to be calm, translucent spaces designed by Sanaa, the Japanese architects. But the real art -- and we would expect nothing less from the woman who gave us the $600 nylon backpack -- is the packaging. Chaste, white, flattened tubes; foil-topped bubbles and condom-size butter dishes; hypodermic-like glass vials; cellophane and hospital-colored paper envelopes give the illusion that these single-dose potions are medicinal. You carry them around to treat the various afflictions of your day (dark circles, dry elbows, etc.). This form of packaging has the added advantage of encouraging high staff-customer interaction, as you will need to describe the stresses inherent in your lifestyle to a complicit listener. The Name is stamped on every unit, no matter how small.</p>
        <p>Finally there is The Price, which should be as impressive as The Name. The Prada lip balm is a breathtaking $60 for 30 single-dose bubbles. If you wonder why someone would pay $60 when a $5 item in drugstores would do the job, you are not ready for conceptual cosmetics. By seeking out and paying for such balms, lotions or fragrances, one demonstrates that she is an individual with particular needs that can be met only by an icon of style like Prada or Helmut Lang.</p>
        <p>Novelty has always been the engine that drives sales in the beauty industry. Conceptual cosmetics are so new they are beyond new. Deploring the practice of bringing out a product and pushing it for all it's worth only to drop it after two years, Lang says his perfumes and scents ''will hopefully last forever.'' Coming from a man whose reputation rests on his ability to reveal the future on a semiannual basis, this statement has a wistful poignancy. It is as if he hopes that by leaping far enough ahead he will achieve escape velocity and vault himself outside of time entirely, which is quite a concept.</p>
