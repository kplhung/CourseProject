        <p>Following European style-makers like Chanel and Galleries Lafayette, which produce fashion magazines for customers, two retailers with stores in the United States, Bergdorf Goodman and Sephora, are branching out into publishing this fall. A step up from hip ''catazines'' put out by companies like American Eagle Outfitters, the Bergdorf Goodman publication is designed to resemble a magazine, with lush fashion and beauty spreads by high-end photographers including Peter Lindbergh (albeit with unusual captions directing readers to ''the Third Floor'') and a smattering of articles on subjects like Giorgio Armani. The premiere issue, produced by the Paris-based publisher Assouline, will be mailed to 300,000 of the store's customers on Sept. 12; copies are also sold at Rizzoli bookstores for $10. Sephora's Sephora.Com, based on the content of its online magazine, showcases products sold at the store, but also offers standard magazine service features from beauty tips to horoscopes. It will be available Sept. 15 at Sephora stores. The Bergdorf magazine's mission, according to its ''Welcome'' page, is ''to provide more useful information'' and ''stimulate dialogue.'' Yeah, stimulating dialogue like ''Oooh, I love that coat! Don't you?''</p>
