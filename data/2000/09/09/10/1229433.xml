        <p>When the 2000 Olympic Summer Games begin Friday in Sydney, Australia, the season in the Southern Hemisphere will still be winter, fading into spring. In addition to being the first Olympics in a new century -- a new millennium -- the Sydney Olympics will be the last Games in the era of Juan Antonio Samaranch. Mr. Samaranch, head of the International Olympic Committee since 1980, will step down, belatedly, next year.</p>
        <p>During his tenure, Mr. Samaranch has transformed the Olympic Games into a venue for professional athletes and into a marketing juggernaut. Even as he put Olympics financing on a solid, if overly commercial basis, he also allowed the I.O.C. to attain a dismaying level of corruption and insularity. His imperious management style and insensitivity to ethical lapses will not be missed.</p>
        <p>The coming Games will also be one of the last Olympics, one hopes, to be held in a city chosen by a crooked selection process that has left the I.O.C. and several of the cities that bid for the Games, including Sydney and Salt Lake City, which will host the 2002 Winter Games, embarrassed. Over all, 1999 was a nightmare for the I.O.C., whose cloak of secrecy was removed by the investigations that resulted from Salt Lake City's flawed bid.</p>
        <p>In response, the I.O.C. has created an ethics commission and adopted other reforms. It committed itself to greater representation from active athletes, and banned the site-selection committee from visiting cities bidding for the Games to prevent offers of free travel and other financial inducements from municipal groups. Despite new drug-testing policies, however, the I.O.C. still struggles to keep pace with the bewildering proliferation of performance-enhancing substances.</p>
        <p>The coming Games, and the natural ebullience of the Australian hosts, may do much to restore the luster of the Olympics. That is the way it usually goes. Each Olympics sets off an explosion of activity years in advance -- the sale of television and advertising rights, the construction of arenas, housing and transportation systems. These things should serve to embellish the athletic contests. But recently it has worked the other way around.</p>
        <p>It has been up to the athletes and the quality of their contests to redeem the blunders of the host cities, the broadcasting networks, the advertisers, and the local and international Olympic committees. It has been up to the athletes to remind us that the real contest at the Olympics is not for television rights or product placement or viewer share, or, for that matter, national medal totals. What matters are the Games, which will give the world a chance to see athletes competing at the limits of speed, agility and grace.</p>
