        <p>THE morning the long anticipated moment finally arrived, Kelly Murray, 18, of Brightwaters got up at 5 and had one last breakfast with her family. Then Ms. Murray and her mother, Eva, 40, along with her two younger sisters and her aunt and uncle, began filling two cars and a pickup truck with Ms. Murray's belongings. At 9 a.m., just as check-in for the dormitories began for the class of 2004, the Murrays pulled up in front of Mendelsohn Quad at the State University at Stony Brook.</p>
        <p>Time to say farewell to childhood, hello to independence.</p>
        <p>Ms. Murray went inside to get the key to her room. Waiting outside, her mother felt proud -- her oldest daughter was starting college -- but she was also trying hard not to cry.</p>
        <p>''I told her when she was inside of me I wanted her to attend Stony Brook,'' Mrs. Murray said. ''I used to rub my belly and say: 'You're going to be a doctor. You're going to Stony Brook.' My dream is coming true.'' Yet for Mrs. Murray, a lab coordinator and reflexologist, the send-off was bittersweet. ''One less to worry about,'' she said wistfully. ''I feel like I accomplished something. If I get all three of them through college, I've done my job.''</p>
        <p>Her daughter was one of 2,298 freshman and transfer students who moved into 25 residence halls at Stony Brook on Sept. 2. Months of worry over SAT scores, college applications and admissions decisions were over. Now the challenge was to be the first in the dorm room to pick the best bed. To fit all the trappings of college life -- computer, television, stereo, VCR, refrigerator, fan, CD's, skates and stuffed animals -- into half, or possibly a third, of a 13-foot-by-14-foot room. And pray that the person assigned to the other half of the space didn't turn out to be the roommate from hell.</p>
        <p>''I've heard many horror stories -- I just hope we get along,'' Ms. Murray said as she led a parade of helpers carrying boxes up three flights of stairs. Within minutes, she had made the bed with a new purple comforter and put her teddy bear and stuffed dog against a backrest.</p>
        <p>''Does it look like my room now, Mom?'' Ms. Murray asked, pulling out framed photos of her boyfriend.</p>
        <p>''Just throw some clothes on the floor,'' her mother replied.</p>
        <p>Down the hall, Rhonda Hunte, 18, of Brooklyn grabbed the only single bed in a triple room, leaving the bunk bed. Between her parents, uncle, two cousins and brother, Jared, 7, the boxes, suitcases, refrigerator and stash of juice and water, there was barely enough space to unpack.</p>
        <p>''I thought it would be a bit bigger than this,'' she said, standing in the middle of the heap. ''It's O.K. I'm going to try and make it as comfortable as possible.''</p>
        <p>Jared just sat on the edge of the bed and sulked. Ms. Hunte was his third sibling to leave for college in a week ''I feel sick about it,'' he said. ''I don't like sleeping alone.''</p>
        <p>Solitude was not something David Nigai, 18, of Queens and Casey Chan, 18, of Brooklyn were going to have to contemplate. They were going to share one of 349 triple rooms assigned this semester. The triples are actually rooms meant for two students, but they will be shared by three until January, when a new dormitory and a five-year, $70 million renovation of residence halls is scheduled for completion. Mr. Nigai took the single bed. Mr. Chan settled on the lower bunk. Their third roommate, Abdullahi Sada, 16, of Hempstead, hadn't arrived yet.</p>
        <p>There were only two desks and two sets of drawers. College Lesson 101: learning to share. Mr. Nigai wasn't worried. ''I'm mainly concerned with making friends and getting to know my environment,'' he said. ''Social is the priority.'' Here, he has an advantage over other students: his twin sister, Vera. Assigned to a triple room in a suite across campus, Ms. Nigai had already dropped off her gear and come over to visit.</p>
        <p>She said she was worried about adapting to lecture halls with 500 students rather than classrooms with 30. ''There are still so many decisions,'' she said. ''Who I befriend. Who I trust. Where to eat. How to dispense my working time, my studying time. It's just overwhelming.''</p>
        <p>Their mother, Veronica Nigai, a 51-year-old store manager, said she was confident her children would be fine. As for herself, she wasn't so sure. ''I'm scared and devastated,'' she said. ''I already feel the 'empty nest' syndrome just by stepping on the campus.''</p>
        <p>Not Mr. Chan's mother, Dana, a 46-year-old secretary. She was ticking off the benefits of having her only child away at college. ''I don't have to go home after work and make dinner,'' she said. ''I can go for a drink after work.''</p>
        <p>With the help of her parents, Leanne Kelly, 18, of Freeport, one of Vera Nigai's six suitemates, had her new computer and printer, television, VCR, refrigerator and fan set up before heading to a barbecue for students and their parents. Her bed was strewn with books, videos and odds and ends. She looked miserable.</p>
        <p>''It's not what I expected,'' she said of her new accommodations.</p>
        <p>What did she expect? ''Room service,'' said her father, Kevin, a New York City firefighter. And what was he thinking about? ''How I am going to pay for this,'' he said. Tuition at SUNY Stony Brook is $3,400 a year, plus $2,112 a semester for a room and $1,150 a semester for meals.</p>
        <p>''I'm very proud of her,'' Mr. Kelly added. ''I just want her to make some friends, get out of the shell and cut the cord.''</p>
        <p>Her mother, Marilee Kelly, a homemaker, was less certain. ''Who's going to do her laundry now?'' she said. ''Up till last night, I'm washing her jeans.'' Her daughter assured her she'd learn.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Nigai wondered whether she or the twins would call first. She said she hadn't spent a night away from her children in 18 years, and she wasn't taking any chances. ''They are not eager to come home,'' she said. ''I'll be here every weekend.''</p>
        <p>Dogs' Best Friends</p>
        <p>Dogs and cats end up at shelters for many different reasons. Families move; owners divorce. And at the end of the Hamptons season, pets purchased to amuse children at the beach frequently get left behind.</p>
        <p>To call attention to their plight, the Bide-A-Wee Shelter of Westhampton held a pet parade on Aug. 30. And they invited other groups to march along: the Animal Rescue Fund, Kent Animal Shelter, Southampton Animal Control, the Guide Dog Foundation of Smithtown and R.S.V.P., which stands for Responsible Solutions for Valued Pets, a volunteer group in Westhampton that seeks foster homes for pets.</p>
        <p>''It's important that we work together,'' said Buffy Cooke, chairwoman of Bide-A-Wee, as rescued greyhounds, retrievers and mutts strutted in front of the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center.</p>
        <p>Patty Robinson, an R.S.V.P. volunteer, brought Dale and David, two Pekingese available for adoption.  ''There are all sorts of breeds available for adoption and rescue,'' she said. ''Some people think it's only big dogs or mixed breeds. That's not true.''</p>
        <p>Cola, a shepherd mix from the Animal Rescue Fund, was happy just to lie in the middle of the road and pant. ''She's an outstanding dog -- no bad habits at all,'' said Sara Davison, the executive director of the fund, an East Hampton shelter, who was reveling in the show of solidarity among the groups.</p>
        <p>Ms. Davison said that everyone from Billy Joel and Jimmy Buffett to local baymen and landscapers have adopted animals from the Animal Rescue Fund. ''Shelters have wonderful animals,'' she said. ''What a good thing we can do by rescuing from a shelter rather than from a puppy mill or a pet shop.''</p>
        <p>Jax, a 2-year-old golden retriever up for adoption from the Kent shelter in Calverton, wagged his tail. ''It's more difficult to find homes for older animals,'' said Pam Green, the executive director, though she expected Jax to find a home quickly. He had been to obedience school. He was housebroken. And like most older dogs, he was past the chewing-the-furniture stage.</p>
        <p>To show support, Linda Gardner of Quogue brought Natasha, a Siberian husky she adopted six years ago.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gardner said people were shocked when they learned she rescued the well-mannered purebred from a shelter. ''We felt that a dog that's rescued is a different kind of dog,'' she said. ''They need homes. After being in a crate or a cage so long, they understand what it's like to have a home. They appreciate it.''</p>
