        <p>Red Sox pitcher Bryce Florie, hit in the face by a line drive in Friday's game with the Yankees, underwent surgery today and, the team said, there was extensive damage to his right eye.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox released a statement from Bill Morgan, their team doctor, who said Florie's right eyeball was severely injured. There was retinal damage, Morgan said, but it was not yet clear if further surgery was needed. The chance of regaining reasonable vision was guarded, he said. Morgan also said Florie had three fractures around his right eye socket that would require surgery, a nasal fracture, a fracture of the medial wall and a fracture of the floor of the socket.</p>
