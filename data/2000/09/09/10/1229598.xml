        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>LAST NIGHT A DJ SAVED MY LIFE: The History of the Disc Jockey, by Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton. (Grove, paper, $14.) A lively account of the unsung heroes of popular music, the club D.J.'s who in their enthusiasm and their technical competence developed the ears of nearly everyone else and led the music almost everywhere it has gone.</p>
        <p>AN OBEDIENT FATHER, by Akhil Sharma. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $23.) The main narrator in this novel by a New York investment banker is a low, corrupt functionary in the Delhi school system. It's easy to brand him despicable because he is, but his power to do ill is limited, his personality complex and his author compassionate.</p>
        <p>A HOLE IN THE EARTH, by Robert Bausch. (Harcourt, $24.) Bausch's fourth novel concerns Henry Porter, 39, the sole flop in a family of successes, whose fixation in preternatural adolescence is mitigated by his own humiliations and the kindness of others.</p>
        <p>JEW VS. JEW: The Struggle for the Soul of American Jewry, by Samuel G. Freedman. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $26.) A journalism professor, once a reporter for The Times, explores the frictions that have risen in America, especially between the Orthodox and the less Orthodox, and envisions a possible future in which religion alone will be the determinant of who is Jewish and who not.</p>
        <p>THE SECRET PARTS OF FORTUNE: Three Decades of Intense Investigations and Edgy Enthusiasms, by Ron Rosenbaum. (Random House, $29.95.) A generous collection of journalism by a writer who has exposed himself to many of the great obsessions of the 20th century without losing his curiosity, his skepticism or his willingness to listen.</p>
        <p>I LOVED YOU ALL, by Paula Sharp. (Hyperion, $23.95.) An old-fashioned storytelling novel about the escalating defiance of hard-line anti-abortionists in the 1970's; the leading character (on the side that is clearly not the author's) has the depth and energy to become indispensable to people whose lives or children are out of control.</p>
        <p>THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, by Catherine Bush. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $24.) A novel with the nerve to use war as a metaphor for the travails of love; its protagonist, a graduate in war studies, has fled Canada after two men fought a duel over her.</p>
        <p>SISTER: The Life of the Legendary American Interior Decorator Mrs. Henry Parish II, by Apple Parish Bartlett and Susan Bartlett Crater. (St. Martin's, $35.) An oral history, compiled by the daughter and granddaughter of the aristocrat who went into the decorating business in 1933 and lived a life characterized by robust frivolity and hard work.</p>
        <p>BLOOD OF THE LIBERALS, by George Packer. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $26.) Liberalism, under one or another definition, is the force that shaped and eventually failed the author's grandfather (a Congressman from Alabama), his father (a legal scholar and student of procedure) and himself (once a Peace Corps volunteer, now a writer).</p>
