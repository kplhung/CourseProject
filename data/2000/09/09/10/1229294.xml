        <p>The federal Office of Management and Budget has  reversed a proposal for interpreting census data that would have made New Jersey a statistical nonentity. The Metropolitan Area Standards Review Committee, a federal panel that reviews how census information is classified, planned to define areas with a million people or more as ''megapolitan,'' which would have absorbed North Jersey into New York City and South Jersey into Philadelphia. Under the latest plan, a region with at least two and a half million people will be subdivided into ''metropolitan divisions,'' with at least 50,000 people, thus giving New Jersey communities an identity. The Office of Management and Budget will release its final guidelines by Dec. 31.</p>
