        <p>IN terms of distance, the Jersey City Museum is moving a few hundred feet west.</p>
        <p>In terms of improvements, the museum is moving light years away from its old, crowded, inaccessible spot on the fourth floor of the Jersey City Library to a newly renovated, 30,000-square-foot, three-story building all its own.</p>
        <p>Currently, stuffed into the top floor of the stately old library building on Jersey Avenue, the museum has served the city in near anonymity since its opening in 1901, despite an active schedule of exhibits and permanent collections of artifacts and work by local artists that represent the changing face of the diverse city.</p>
        <p>Work is more than halfway done on the future site of the museum, a warehouse on Montgomery Street, two blocks away. The $11 million museum and educational center will be in the heart of Jersey City's historic Van Vorst District and is designed to become a cultural center for the area with two classrooms, a 152-seat auditorium and a state-of-the-art archival and research area.</p>
        <p>''The existing site of the museum has a lot of problems,'' said Nina S. Jacobs, executive director, who has overseen the acquisition of the new site and the project's fund-raising campaign. Major contributors include the New Jersey Council on the Arts and Samuel J. LeFrak, who contributed on behalf of the Newport Associates Development Company, a major developer in Jersey City.</p>
        <p>''What is now my office used to be a bathroom,'' Ms. Jacobs said. ''The lunchroom and staff room was a coat room. But more importantly, there is no way to get large pieces of art to the fourth floor except by way of a tiny elevator or carry them up the narrow stairs. We tried to get major pieces of bronze artwork up here once. Let's just say it was a memorable experience. Also we cannot accept anything that needs climate control and most of our permanent collections are stored off-site.''</p>
        <p>The museum works with Very Special Arts of New Jersey, an organization created to help disabled people, including the blind, enjoy the arts, but the programs the museum can produce are limited.</p>
        <p>''We can't even get a wheelchair up here,'' Ms. Jacobs said. ''The new space will enable us to make art and historical collections accessible to everyone, including the disabled, schoolchildren and scholars.''</p>
        <p>At the turn of the last century, when Jersey City was establishing itself as a metropolitan hub, a library and museum were seen as essential to the city and collections were assembled that represented life there. But by the 1950's, financing for the venture had dwindled and the museum was closed until 1975, when students at Jersey City State College, now New Jersey City University, helped reopen it. .</p>
        <p>Walking sticks used by aristocratic residents, ceramics made in the city, and artwork produced by local artists like August Will, who captured Jersey City in the 1850's and 1860's in watercolors as it changed from rural to urban, are all part of the museum's collection. Residents over the years have donated hundreds of photographs, diaries and letters, some never displayed, of people who lived in the area, many of them immigrants who came through Ellis Island.</p>
        <p>In the search for a new home, which will open next spring in time for the institution's 100th anniversary, at least 50 buildings were examined before the old warehouse, which in the past has served as a garage and a supermarket, was selected.</p>
        <p>''This building is structurally sound although we had to deal with problems that we would not have had to deal with if we had built new,'' Ms. Jacobs said. ''But it is appropriate that we saved an existing building'' that has been in the community for a long time, she said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Bret Schundler has taken an active role in fund-raising and planning for the new museum.</p>
        <p>''One reason people live in a city is for its cultural vitality. This new space will be on the ground level and will invite people to come in,'' Mr. Schundler said. ''It will help weave the current residents into the historical context of Jersey City and will be an intrinsic part of the community.''</p>
        <p>The structure and exterior brick of the building have been maintained by architect Charles Gifford and the upper-floor windows will display banners announcing major exhibitions. The interiors will be light and humidity-controlled and will include an atrium in the main hall and large gallery spaces.</p>
        <p>''The evolution of the Jersey City Museum is not unlike the history of the Newark Museum, which was founded in 1909 and initially housed in the Newark Public Library,'' said Mary Sue Sweeney Price, Newark Museum director. ''The establishment of our own building in the 1920's was pivotal in enabling our collections and programs to flourish and I trust that the Jersey City Museum's expansion will be just as important for that city and its people.''</p>
        <p>The move to what was once a warehouse is as much symbolic as it is practical.</p>
        <p>''This is the story of Jersey City,'' Ms. Jacobs said. ''It's a story of rebirth and renewal. So many old buildings have been lost. This is the fourth generation of Jersey City residents that this wonderful old building will serve and it is its fourth use. It is very appropriate.''</p>
