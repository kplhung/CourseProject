        <p>Rabbi Shlomo Shmulevitz is director of the commandments related to the Land of Israel for the Jerusalem rabbinate.</p>
        <p>This was not a good week to ask him how he was doing.</p>
        <p>''Oy vey,'' he said in Yiddish, then continued in Hebrew-spliced English.</p>
        <p>''I am so tired with all this shmita business. Shmita, shmita, shmita. Headlines about shmita! Talk radio about shmita! Who would have ever imagined?''</p>
        <p>Who, indeed? Even in Israel, shmita, pronounced shmee-TA, is an arcane subject. According to the Torah, shmita is the sabbatical year when the land of Israel is supposed to lie fallow. It occurs every seven years, and a new shmita is scheduled to begin at the end of September on Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year.</p>
        <p>For a century, the start of shmita was not a matter of general concern. A longstanding social agreement allowed Israeli farmers to continue working their land provided that they nominally ''sell'' it to a non-Jew and get a deed of sale from the chief rabbinate. The rabbinate, in fact, arranged the transaction. The average cucumber consumer never knew the difference; everything was kosher.</p>
        <p>But this year, the cucumber cart was overturned by strictly Orthodox rabbis who did not think the Torah bypass, originally justified by the survival needs of the Zionist pioneers, could be justified any longer.</p>
        <p>A leading Hasidic sage ruled that this year the deed of sale would be invalid. This led the state-financed Jerusalem religious council to announce that Israeli fruits and vegetables would not be considered kosher during the shmita year, and that establishments -- grocery stores, restaurants, hotels -- selling them would risk losing their vital kosher certificates.</p>
        <p>As a result, shmita exploded into a national controversy. Incredibly, it managed to touch a panoply of raw nerves: the religious-secular conflict, the Israeli-Arab conflict (the non-Jew who ''buys'' the land of Israel is usually Palestinian), the conflict between the new high-tech economy and the old agricultural economy,  and the conflict between authorities within the Orthodox world.</p>
        <p>Along the way, one of Israel's two chief rabbis, Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, nearly resigned after he was threatened with being ''ostracized'' by part of the strictly Orthodox world for his lenient position upholding the validity of the deed of sale. ''I fear becoming a social outcast,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak intervened on his way to New York this week, President Moshe Katsav summoned religious leaders to his residence, a special rabbinical conference on shmita was hastily assembled, and a compromise was reached. The compromise included a promise by Rabbi Bakshi-Doron that next year he personally would eat only fruits and vegetables grown outside the Land of Israel.</p>
        <p>That would include produce cultivated in the Golan Heights, which, despite the right wing's protests to the contrary during the short-lived Israeli-Syrian peace talks, technically doesn't belong to the Land of Israel, according to Jewish law. It also includes produce cultivated inside the Land of Israel that is grown in pots of Golan Heights soil or on elevated platforms that do not technically touch Israeli soil.</p>
        <p>The modern Orthodox, who are religious Zionists, have always accepted the compromises on shmita, as put forth in a 24-page booklet issued by their community's highest authorities -- the country''s chief rabbis. It is a kind of, ''Everything you always wanted to know about shmita but were afraid to ask,'' and contains coping tips, such as computerizing sprinklers for home gardens.</p>
        <p>But the strictly Orthodox community is not Zionist and doesn't recognize the authority of the state's rabbis, obeying instead the rulings of their own sages. And for many years, those sages have looked askance at the symbolic sale of the land during the shmita year. Its economy diversified, Israel no longer depended on agriculture to survive and, in the rabbis' opinion, the Torah's commandments should only be skirted if survival was at stake.</p>
        <p>Besides, the rabbis believed that the deed of sale was a sham; Israel was not really sanctioning the wholesale transfer of its agricultural lands to the Palestinians whose names were on the documents.</p>
        <p>So religious farmers began letting their fields go fallow, and strictly Orthodox communities shopped only at their own very kosher establishments.</p>
        <p>Strict shmita observance, like not watching television, became one of the things that separated the strictly Orthodox from the modern.</p>
        <p>This year, Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, a leading authority in the strictly Orthodox world, changed his recommendation of strict compliance with the shmita laws to an order.</p>
        <p>Asked what makes this shmita any different, Rabbi Shmulevitz said: ''I have no idea, and I would never ask. I am not on the great rabbi's level.'' He added that he assumed it was a logical progression.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Shmulevitz also said that the sage was misunderstood by the secular public; he had proposed a moderate position, by allowing produce planted before the shmita year started to be harvested and sold  during the sabbatical, and by sanctioning the use of elevated platforms.</p>
        <p>''In Mea Shearim,'' Rabbi Shmulevitz said, referring to a strictly Orthodox neighborhood in Jerusalem, ''they are calling him a Zionist! And in Tel Aviv, they are calling him a religious extremist.''</p>
        <p>The Jerusalem religious council translated his order into a practice that would affect secular farmers and consumers and, in the eyes of many Israelis, impose the views of a very few on the majority.</p>
        <p>At a farming collective northeast of Ashkelon, Binyamin Elbaz, 52, a vegetable grower, stood in his hothouse and expressed his suspicions. ''The only explanation is that the strictly Orthodox are going to make a pile of money off the food they import from Jordan,'' he said. An Orthodox import cartel is indeed what many farmers suspect lies behind the move -- a suggestion which Rabbi Shmulevitz described as absurd. ''I look like I'm getting rich off cauliflowers?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, Mr. Elbaz said, he did what he usually does and authorized rabbinical officials to ''sell'' the land from which he harvests 30 tons of cucumbers and 150 tons of peppers a year. He said he has no idea ''what individual Arab supposedly owns my land.''</p>
        <p>''It's all a crock,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The compromise reached by the rabbinical assembly is murky. The chief rabbi backed down from an initial threat to dismiss some Jerusalem rabbis and to impose on the Jerusalem rabbinate his ruling that the deeds of sale should be respected in their territory. He also agreed that local rabbinates could adopt stricter positions than his, but they apparently accepted that they would not be allowed to force shopkeepers to abide by their stringency.</p>
        <p>The growers' associations say that if need be, they will market their goods directly to the consumers, avoiding the markets that depend on the rabbis for certificates.</p>
        <p>The farmers are confused. ''I've got to place my next order for seeds,'' Mr. Elbaz said, ''and I don''t know what's going to develop between now and the New Year. What do I tell my workers? Go back to Thailand, the fields will be fallow this year?''</p>
        <p>The whole affair exacerbated the already growing tensions between secular and religious here. Usually, it is the religious who are urging Israel to leave alone the status quo that governs the synagogue-state relationship.</p>
        <p>But, in proposing that shmita regulations be tightened, strictly Orthodox rabbis were tampering with the status quo that they usually guard so zealously. And that could backfire at a time when Mr. Barak is proposing a ''civic revolution'' to curb the powers of the religious parties. It could make the secular more avidly secular and affect several ideas now on the table: the city of Herzliya is preparing to open a new mall with Saturday hours, and the transportation minister, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, is proposing that El Al fly on Saturdays.</p>
        <p>''Only a cultural war is left,'' read a headline in the liberal-left newspaper Haaretz this week, atop a column asserting that secular Israelis should now feel empowered to challenge the terms ''dictated by the ultra-Orthodox in the best tradition of the Wild West.''</p>
