        <p>Travel article on spas that have opened outlets, including Golden Door at Boulders Resort in Carefree, Ariz, and Elizabeth Arden's Red Door at Seaview Marriott in Absecon, New Jersey (M)</p>

        <p>AT first glance, the recent announcement that a new 33,000-square-foot spa will open in September 2001 at the Boulders Resort in Carefree, Ariz., seems fairly routine. After all, many of the new spas to open in recent years have been at resort hotels. But this time, the Boulders, which already has a spa and fitness center, will hand over a hefty chunk of its prime desert property to create a branch of the Golden Door, the luxurious spa in Escondido, Calif.</p>
        <p>The new spa will be the third off-campus outpost of the 42-year-old Golden Door, which since January 1999 has opened branches at Wyndham's Las Casitas Village in Las Croabas, Puerto Rico, and the Wyndham Peaks Resort in Telluride, Colo. (Wyndham also operates the Boulders.) And it will be the latest in what industry observers see as the steady proliferation of high-end chain spas at resorts.</p>

        <p>AT first glance, the recent announcement that a new 33,000-square-foot spa will open in September 2001 at the Boulders Resort in Carefree, Ariz., seems fairly routine. After all, many of the new spas to open in recent years have been at resort hotels. But this time, the Boulders, which already has a spa and fitness center, will hand over a hefty chunk of its prime desert property to create a branch of the Golden Door, the luxurious spa in Escondido, Calif.</p>
        <p>The new spa will be the third off-campus outpost of the 42-year-old Golden Door, which since January 1999 has opened branches at Wyndham's Las Casitas Village in Las Croabas, Puerto Rico, and the Wyndham Peaks Resort in Telluride, Colo. (Wyndham also operates the Boulders.) And it will be the latest in what industry observers see as the steady proliferation of high-end chain spas at resorts.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Arden Salons recently opened a 12,000-square-foot Red Door Resort Spa at the Seaview Marriott Resort and Fairway Villas in Absecon, N.J. A spokeswoman said that the company planned some 40 resort and hotel spas over the next five years.</p>
        <p>''What's happening now is similar to what happened in the hotel industry in the late 50's and early 60's,'' said Raoul Andrews Sudre, president of Aspen Spa Management in Fort Lauderdale. ''The public feels comfortable with a brand-name they can recognize.''</p>
        <p>Only within the last couple of years have spas like the Golden Door -- so-called destination spas, where guests check in for extended stays -- leveraged their reputations by opening multiple branches at resorts and hotels. In 1999, Canyon Ranch, which operates destination health resorts in Tucson and in Lenox, Mass., opened its first day spa at the Venetian in Las Vegas, and it plans others. In a different kind of expansion, the company has also announced plans to build two Canyon Ranch cruise ships, Quest 1 and Quest 2, the first to make its debut in 2002.</p>
        <p>For destination spas, which are costly to run, satellite spas at resorts make sense. ''It's getting harder for stand-alone luxury spas to make it on their own,'' said Deborah Szekely, founder of the Golden Door and owner of Rancho La Puerta, who sold the Golden Door in 1998 to the Dallas real estate trust that owns Wyndham International.</p>
        <p>Established spas can bring trained staff and their distinctive programs to resorts. ''Building a facility is one thing, programming it is another,'' said Jerry Cohen, president of Canyon Ranch. ''I'm not sure how willing people in the hospitality industry are to make the commitment needed to run a serious health resort themselves.''</p>
        <p>Spa directors are quick to point out that a day at their resort outposts is different from a week at the home campus. ''What we offer at the Venetian is a taste of our full program,'' said Mr. Cohen. ''You can't get immersed.''</p>
        <p>With chains comes the danger of diluting the experience. So far the spas appear to be expanding with care.</p>
        <p>''When we've finished the Boulders and tweaked our two other Golden Door resorts, we'll take things a step further,'' said Fred Kleisner, C.E.O. of Wyndham International. ''But we'll never franchise or license the Golden Door name.''</p>
