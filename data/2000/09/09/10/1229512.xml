        <p>Representative Albert R. Wynn of Maryland's Fourth Congressional District almost certainly will win a fifth term this fall. He is a black Democrat and his district, on the outskirts of Washington, is mostly black and mostly Democratic. Further, his Republican opponent, John Kimble, who is white, has failed in two earlier challenges to draw more than 15 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Kimble is no quitter. In his first run, he offered to pose nude for Playgirl magazine in an effort to gain attention and raise money. This time around he has recruited the congressman's estranged wife, Jessie, to work in his campaign.</p>

        <p>Representative Albert R. Wynn of Maryland's Fourth Congressional District almost certainly will win a fifth term this fall. He is a black Democrat and his district, on the outskirts of Washington, is mostly black and mostly Democratic. Further, his Republican opponent, John Kimble, who is white, has failed in two earlier challenges to draw more than 15 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Kimble is no quitter. In his first run, he offered to pose nude for Playgirl magazine in an effort to gain attention and raise money. This time around he has recruited the congressman's estranged wife, Jessie, to work in his campaign.</p>
        <p>And some work she is doing . . .</p>
        <p>The Wynns are in a bitter divorce and child custody battle. Mrs. Wynn, who is black, has this to say in a 20-second message Mr. Kimble is circulating in the Fourth District by random telephone dialing:</p>
        <p>''Hi, this is Jessie Wynn, wife of Congressman Albert Wynn. Albert Wynn does not respect black women. He left me for a white woman. Please send your donations to Kimble for Congress. Help us defeat Albert Wynn.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Wynn also appears in a photo posted on Mr. Kimble's Web site. She is standing next to a red banner that reads, ''Al Wynn left his black wife and child for a white woman.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimble acknowledges he is ''playing the race card'' with the Jessie Wynn attacks. He says it's the only way to beat the congressman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wynn's response:</p>
        <p>''Hell hath no fury. . .''</p>
