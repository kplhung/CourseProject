        <p>It has been 10 years since Randy Primas left office, but the people up in Trenton still call him from time to time. They ask him what it was like when he was mayor here, what he thinks they should do now that the city is prostrate once again, and what the chances are for the state's most desperate city to recover some semblance of prosperity.</p>
        <p>Melvin R. Primas was the mayor of Camden from 1981 to 1999, but he was more than just that. As the man who followed Angelo J. Errichetti into office -- Mr. Errichetti, you'll remember, was on his way to prison for corruption -- and having been followed by two mayors who were subsequently indicted, Mr. Primas is known around Trenton as the last good mayor of a city that sorely needed one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Primas will no doubt be called on to talk some more about Camden this fall, when the State Legislature goes back into session and its members take their first hard look at the Whitman Administration's Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Revitalization Act, also known as the Camden takeover bill for the power it gives the state to assume full authority over the elected and administrative powers of the city.</p>
        <p>What will he tell them? First, that the problems of Camden have been a long time coming, and could be seen clearly 19 years ago when, as a new mayor, he began forecasting the city's yawning budget deficit into the future. Two, that the state's most lamented but politically inviolate system of financing schools and municipal administrations with real estate taxes will never raise enough money to make a poor city like Camden self-sufficient. And third, that the crisis of Camden is not going to be Mrs. Whitman's problem much longer, and that the people jockeying to be elected governor next fall should be thinking about their policies for cities like Camden sooner rather than later.</p>
        <p>''The key was that we were able to sit down with the people in Trenton and to make a case for our problems,'' Mr. Primas, who is now an investment banker, said in an interview. ''As soon as I got into office, we projected out our budget deficit four, five, six years, and we could show them that the need for aid was going to increase exponentially over the next 10 years. It wasn't at 80 percent of the budget then, but we showed that it was going to be.''</p>
        <p>The reason for Camden's crash are by now familiar: the big factories moved out and the middle-income people followed. Today, every census tract in the city qualifies for federal poverty programs. Harder to understand is why it has stayed so poor while at the same time Jersey City, Hoboken, Newark and Trenton have shown some improvement during the long boom years. If the curious legislators ask Mr. Primas that, he will tell them to look across the Delaware from the Camden's waterfront.</p>
        <p>''The Philadelphia economy never heated up the way New York City's did,'' Mr. Primas said. Without a sharp difference in real estate costs between the city and its neighbor, Philadelphia never spun off the millions in new office development that has transformed the once decaying Hudson River waterfront across from Manhattan into a new urban landscape.</p>
        <p>Milton Milan, the current mayor of Camden, has complained to anyone who will listen that the city needs help with economic development before it can pay its own bills. But since Mr. Milan is also under indictment for selling his office, his pleas have tended to be dismissed. But ask Mr. Primas, and he will tell the legislators the same thing: Just plugging the budget gap is not enough.</p>
        <p>''As I look back on it, I realize that we managed to fill the gap but we never had the extra dollars to set the stage for growth,'' he said. ''Every year we were holding on by our fingernails and getting just enough money to get through the year, and that's tough. That's tough. You never see any discretionary dollars and you never get a chance to set the stage for development.''</p>
        <p>That is the second message to the Legislature: Will the takeover prescription simply mean another decade of giving Camden just enough to scrape by, or will there be the enough additional money to allow the city to invest and blossom? The state has already poured millions into the city, of course, and new roads -- the Entertainment Center and the state aquarium are all evidence of that. But as Mr. Primas pointed out, what the city needs is employers with good jobs.</p>
        <p>''Ronald Reagan was president during my tenure,'' Mr. Primas went on, ''and he pointed to Cherry Hill as a community that worked, that didn't need any federal help. And I thought to myself, there we are two miles away, one of the poorest cities in America and one that can't survive without help.''</p>
        <p>Reformers in New Jersey have complained for years that the reliance on local real estate taxes -- the kind that Cherry Hill is rich in and that Camden lacks -- is unfair to children who attend underfinanced schools. And as Mr. Primas points out, it is unfair to municipalities that are kept in a continual straitjacket of low revenue while being urged by their suburban neighbors to do more for themselves.</p>
        <p>There is a good argument over urban policy in all of those issues. Will the legislators and the candidates listen?</p>
