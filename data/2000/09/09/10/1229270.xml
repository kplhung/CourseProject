        <p>WHEN Richard Mills, a Teaneck artist and environmentalist, takes children on tours of the Hackensack River, he likes to ask them to draw pictures of what paradise looks like. They draw the sun, birds, ducks, flowers, green grass and a river. That, he says, is pretty much the way the land around the Hackensack River used to look.</p>
        <p>The riverfront was a kind of paradise before industrialization, says Mr. Mills, a member of the Hackensack River Greenway Task Force that helped create the three-and-a-half-mile Hackensack River Greenway through Teaneck.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills, who is also coordinator of fine arts at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University, used his sabbatical to create signs for the new Greenway. He did research, talked to old-timers and local historians, and created a series of 16 signs he calls ''Hackensack River Stories.''</p>
        <p>The vinyl laminated signs will be posted this week near the river in Teaneck along the Greenway, which runs from Bogota to New Milford. The digitally created collages describe 350 years of history. They show old prints of estates, farms and boat clubs; 19th-century postcards of schooners with names like ''Ophelia'' and ''Magic'' sailing on the river; pictures of people swimming and fishing; and images of long-gone Atlantic white cedars, canoes and cattails.</p>
        <p>The signs also tell of the river's undoing. One relates the remarks of a Bergen County freeholder in 1916 urging that the river and its shores be developed to produce revenue. In May, the signs were exhibited at the Fairleigh Dickinson University College Art Gallery and the first of the signs was installed near the river in Teaneck's Andreas Park.</p>
        <p>A landscape artist and printmaker, Mr. Mills says he has shifted the focus of his work from ''representing the landscape to helping people read the landscape.'' Since the late 1960's there has been a new approach to the land, he says.</p>
        <p>''There has been a very big push now to find ways to connect people to a sense of place, working not just with artists, but with historians and geologists, geographers and other disciplines, local historians and just regular people in the community,'' Mr. Mills said. ''The whole thing about authorship -- the great genius toiling away alone romantically -- has gotten a little stale.''</p>
        <p>Among the myriad items Mills has incorporated in his ''Hackensack Stories'' are a drawing by a township second grader and a photograph taken by a lawyer on the Greenway committee.</p>
        <p>The signs are ''little jewels that integrate art and the environment,'' said Marie Roberts, coordinator of the fine arts division of the school of communications at Fairleigh Dickinson and director of the College Art Gallery. ''I've been interested in making art more accessible to the masses, so that people can see it on the streets, and I thought he did a beautiful job with relatively inexpensive material that, if they are damaged, can be replaced.''</p>
        <p>The signs are also a pivotal part of the effort to raise awareness of the river, said Bill Sheehan, the Hackensack Riverkeeper whose mission is to preserve and restore the Hackensack River through outreach and advocacy. ''What he's done is taken the history, the present-day condition and the potential for the river and laid them out graphically as a way for people to come to the water's edge and know what they're looking at. Interpretation and programming are half the battle.''</p>
        <p>By the mid-20th century, Mr. Sheehan explained, pollution overwhelmed the Hackensack River's ability to clean itself out, and people had basically turned their backs on the waterway as a source of recreation.</p>
        <p>Since the 1970's, as a result of the passage of environmental laws like the federal Clean Rivers Act, rivers have made a comeback. Before the 1970's, there were about 13 species of fish and other marine life that could survive in the Hackensack, Mr. Sheehan said. Today there are close to 50. The number of fowl species has gone from 120 in the 1960's to about 265. Mr. Sheehan said he hoped to work with Mr. Mills to bring his signs to other towns on the river.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 16, Mr. Mills will receive the Friend of the Hackensack River Award, which will be presented by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at a dinner.</p>
        <p>On a summer afternoon, Mr. Mills showed a visitor his new sign in Andreas Park. A russet-colored woodchuck darted through the underbrush, a carp splashed in the river and the wind rustled through the reeds on the riverbank. Paul Montesano, a senior at Rutgers University, was walking along the Greenway and paused to look at the black, white and green sign titled''Hackensack River, the River of Many Bends.'' It showed a 1912 map of the river valley and a satellite photo of the same area. There was also an account of the region's multicultural history; pictures of the Ackerman homestead, the DeVoe Andreas farm; an etching of a schooner; a photo of a farmer with a horse and hay wagon; and a postcard view of New Bridge Landing at the Zabriskie-Steuben House where Thomas Paine drafted the ''American Crisis'' and the words, ''These are the times that try men's souls.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills and Mr. Montesano struck up a conversation. ''Oh boy, would I love to get you involved in the river Greenway,'' Mr. Mills said. ''You think you might have a little time to volunteer?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesano said he just might.</p>
