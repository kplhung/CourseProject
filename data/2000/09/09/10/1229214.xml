        <p>ONE year after West Nile virus arrived in the New York area, scientists continue to prove, week after week, that it is all over the state. What they have been unable to prove is what exactly that means.</p>
        <p>Although dozens of birds have died of the disease, no person here is known to have caught it. More than 100,000 mosquitoes have been trapped and tested since late spring, but of the ones that have been infected, none bite humans.</p>
        <p>''From our perspective, it's really a function of surveillance,'' said William Gerrish, a spokesman for the State Department of Public Health. ''It's a relatively new issue that we're learning about, really day to day, as we go along.''</p>
        <p>The question of risk remains a sticky one. Scientists have found both that the pesticides used to ward off mosquitoes can cause health problems in people and kill honeybees and marine life.</p>
        <p>Scientists said that very few contract the disease and that most of those who do never know they had it. But at the same time, of the nine people in Westchester County who had caught the West Nile virus last year, one died. So Connecticut public health officials can't relax.</p>
        <p>They continue to test people with encephalitis-like symptoms for West Nile virus, and they are watching domestic chickens, so far finding nothing in either population. They continue to warn people to avoid mosquitoes by staying in at dusk and banishing standing water from their yards.</p>
        <p>Theodore Andreadis, chief medical entomologist for the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, said the next couple of weeks are going to be critical.</p>
        <p>At this time of the summer, he said, ''this thing begins to amplify. It's obviously cycling between bird-feeding mosquitoes and birds.''</p>
        <p>As of last Wednesday, the State Department of Environmental Protection and State Department of Health reported that 223 birds, the primary carriers, died here of West Nile since the spring. These included 219 crows, 2 robins, 1 dove, and 1 blue jay in 35 towns or cities. The tallies cover the summer's bird collections through Aug. 25.</p>
        <p>Tests detected West Nile virus in three pools of mosquitoes. However, none of the species of mosquitoes infected so far bite human beings. Insects bearing the virus were found in Stamford on July 21 and in Norwalk on Aug. 16 and Aug. 22.</p>
        <p>The state adopted a policy to avoid spraying pesticides unless people seem directly threatened by West Nile, but officials sent out trucks to spray a pesticide in Stamford after the July 21 discovery.</p>
        <p>''The idea was that perhaps we could contain it,'' Mr. Gerrish said. ''We subsequently learned that the virus has amplified throughout the state and certainly the region.''</p>
        <p>The chemical used was resmethrin, marketed under the name Scourge. It is a synthetic substance based on plants such as the chrysanthemum.</p>
        <p>Scientists consider it relatively safe, but it is known to cause trembling, tremors, or numbness if people are exposed to high doses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended it, Mr. Andreadis said.</p>
        <p>Diane Lauricella, co-chairwoman of Connecticut Seeking Alternatives for the Environment, a Fairfield County citizens group, said they would have protested more vehemently in July if they had realized the spraying was in response to infected mosquitoes that bite birds, not humans.</p>
        <p>Still, she said, in Connecticut, they are doing much better than in other states, because officials have been cautious about spraying. She compared this to New York spraying Central Park five times.</p>
        <p>Most of the infected birds found this year came from lower Fairfield County: in Greenwich, Stamford, Darien, New Canaan, Norwalk, Westport, Fairfield, and also in Milford, Mr. Andreadis said. He identified the Hartford area as another ''hot spot'' for infected birds.</p>
        <p>In the latest batch of mosquitoes, tested the week of Aug. 29, 16,605 mosquitoes from 69 traps (out of 73 placed around the state) all tested negative for West Nile virus and for a more serious virus, Eastern equine encephalitis.</p>
        <p>So health officials must decide if it is appropriate to stop worrying about a disease like West Nile, and instead focus fear on something that kills more people but seems to inspire less panic, such as the flu.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to sort all that out,'' Mr. Andreadis said. ''This is only our second year into this. We don't have answers to a lot of things. We don't really know the correlation between finding infected birds in an area and relative risk to human transmission.''</p>
        <p>The level of vigilance by public health scientists shouldn't transfer to panic in the general public, Mr. Andreadis said. He said residents must understand that scientists have to react with alarm because West Nile is a new disease in the Western Hemisphere and that its presence here should not be treated lightly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andreadis said that even on Staten Island, the apparent center of the disease this year, humans are at a low risk of catching it.</p>
        <p>''But, it's still there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The experiment station believes it's important to check dead birds for the virus, but Mr. Andreadis stressed that the virus itself is ''nothing to get terribly concerned about.''</p>
