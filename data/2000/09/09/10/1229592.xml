        <p>''We know where love is by its stillness,'' Fanny Howe writes in one of the spare, muscled poems gathered in SELECTED POEMS (University of California, cloth, $40; paper, $15.95), work culled from 20 years of her poetry. Indeed, it's stillness more than anything else that tempers this volume; its quiet, forceful poems carry an existential weight that belies their small size. Among other things, Howe has made a long-term project of trying to determine how we fit into God's world, and her aim is both true and marvelously free of sentimental piety. ''Mad God, mad thought / Take me for a walk,'' she writes, ''Stalk me. Made God, / Wake me with your words. / Believe in what I said.'' Her work is fueled by a persistent need to find out not the meaning of life itself, but how to ask what it is. ''A feeling triggers a feeling, then the heft / Of the hand to work,'' Howe states in a typically Dickinsonian moment. It's as if she can't help herself -- these fierce poems demand to be put forth. Taken together, they create a world of their own, a series of structures that dot the landscape Howe travels. ''My vagabondage / is unlonelied by poems'' she confesses at one point, as if to justify her questioning. She's on a private quest through the metaphysical universe, and the results are startling and honest. ''If goals create content stealth creates form,'' she writes. Her ''Selected Poems'' proves she's absolutely correct.</p>
