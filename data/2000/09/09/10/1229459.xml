        <p>The glitter started early at Belmont Park yesterday. The Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus galloped a mile and a quarter in the morning for his comeback race, whenever that may be. Crown Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia arrived in the afternoon with an entourage from the United Nations, and presented the winner's trophy after the Man o'War Stakes. And finally, the road to the Breeders' Cup opened wide with three stakes races crammed with star horses and high drama.</p>
        <p>If any clue to the Breeders' Cup puzzle developed, it came on the turf, where European horses ran 1-2 in the $500,000 Man o'War in their debuts on American soil. Fantastic Light, the odds-on favorite, won, with Ela Athena a length behind. Drama Critic was a neck farther back in third. The 9-year-old John's Call, who won the Sword Dancer at Saratoga last month by nine lengths, finished fourth.</p>

        <p>The glitter started early at Belmont Park yesterday. The Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus galloped a mile and a quarter in the morning for his comeback race, whenever that may be. Crown Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia arrived in the afternoon with an entourage from the United Nations, and presented the winner's trophy after the Man o'War Stakes. And finally, the road to the Breeders' Cup opened wide with three stakes races crammed with star horses and high drama.</p>
        <p>If any clue to the Breeders' Cup puzzle developed, it came on the turf, where European horses ran 1-2 in the $500,000 Man o'War in their debuts on American soil. Fantastic Light, the odds-on favorite, won, with Ela Athena a length behind. Drama Critic was a neck farther back in third. The 9-year-old John's Call, who won the Sword Dancer at Saratoga last month by nine lengths, finished fourth.</p>
        <p>Fantastic Light, a 4-year-old son of Rahy owned by Godolphin Stables and trained by Saeed bin Suroor, has won 7 of his 15 starts. He completed the mile and three-eighths in 2:172/5 , paid $3.30 for a $2 bet to win and earned $300,000. Tom Albertrani, the assistant trainer, said that his colt would race next in the $750,000 Turf Classic at Belmont Park on Oct. 7.</p>
        <p>The performance by Fantastic Light was accompanied by America's best jockey, Jerry Bailey, who said: ''He overcame a lot. I decided to go outside down the backstretch, and felt I had the field at his mercy the entire time.''</p>
        <p>In the $200,000 Gazelle Handicap for 3-year-old fillies, no change of fortune smiled on the favored Secret Status, who won the Kentucky Oaks and the Mother Goose but lost her last two starts, the Coaching Club American Oaks and the Alabama. She ran sixth in a field of eight. Critical Eye drove to post a major upset by a nose over Plenty of Light, with Resort nearly five lengths behind in third.</p>
        <p>Critical Eye ran the mile and an eighth under Mike Smith in 1:482/5  and paid $51.50 for a $2 bet, treating her trainer, Scott Schwartz, to his first Grade I success. Schwartz glowed for his filly, saying: ''She's run her race every time. She can do anything.''</p>
        <p>In the $107,700 Floral Park Handicap, with the Breeders' Cup Sprint on the horizon, six fillies rushed six furlongs with Big Bambu leading every step of the way to win by six lengths over Tropical Punch. It was the sixth victory in nine races for Big Bambu. She is trained by Alan Sobol and, with Robbie Davis riding, she covered the distance in 1:094/5  and returned $5.40 for a $2 bet.</p>
        <p>Cash Run, who won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies last November, finished third for her seventh straight loss. The 3-2 favorite, Hurricane Bertie, ran fourth to the dismay of her rider, Pat Day, who said, ''She was never really in the race.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>Gulfstream Park raised the purse for the Florida Derby, the premier prep in the East, from $750,000 to  $1 million, matching the country's other major prep, the Santa Anita Derby, and the Triple Crown classics: the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes.</p>
