        <p>As the Yankees stockpiled one new player after another this season, their cash register kept ringing up higher and higher numbers. Except this was the register that was paying out cash to the players.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' payroll, which began the season at a record $92.5 million, was spiraling sky high, soaring to heights unknown to baseball management. The game's first $100 million payroll was a work in progress. Where it would end up nobody knew.</p>
        <p>As higher and higher numbers were published, the Yankees brass became more and more uncomfortable. They protested that the numbers did not reflect the actual dollars they were spending. They were correct, but the annual salary reports produced by management and the players association have never used actual dollars spent. They have always attributed a player's entire salary to the team that has him Aug. 31, even if he was traded to the team that day.</p>
        <p>With computers able to determine payrolls in any form desired, both sides could change their systems, but they retain the way they have always done things for that very reason -- that's the way they have always done things. It has been the only way to compare payrolls and average salaries of the 2000 season, say, with previous seasons.</p>
        <p>Using the traditional, if outdated, method, the Yankees this season have a payroll totaling an unheard-of $112 million. That figure is based on the 25 players who were on their major league roster and the eight players who were on the disabled list Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>But in terms of actual dollars spent, the Yankees are paying their players $102.5 million this season. That's about $10 million less than advertised, but it's not going to placate the critics among baseball officials and other owners who complain that the Yankees' salary expenditures are out of control.</p>
        <p>The actual dollar figure is computed by determining how many days of the 182-day season players have been with the Yankees and what portion of their salaries that time represents.</p>
        <p>The total includes not just the salaries of Aug. 31 players but those of everyone who has played for the team this season, from the $12,357,143 for Bernie Williams and the $12 million for David Cone to the $4,395.60 outfielder Luke Wilcox was paid for his four days on the Yankees' roster in July and the $5,553.57 Ed Yarnall earned in his five days with the team in April and July.</p>
        <p>The difference between the two totals comes primarily from the salaries of the five major players the Yankees acquired in June and July. David Justice, Denny Neagle, Jose Vizcaino, Jose Canseco and Glenallen Hill have 2000 salaries totaling $19.75 million, but the Yankees will pay them $9,210,164. In addition, they will pay Neagle $250,000, under a provision in his contract, because he was traded.</p>
        <p>The Yankees added two other players in July and August who had been released by their previous teams, so they are paying Dwight Gooden and Luis Polonia prorated shares of the $200,000 minimum salary. The team gets their services for a total of $160,439. They are paying another newcomer, Luis Sojo, a mere $135,989, meaning the 10 new players -- 40 percent of the roster -- will cost the Yankees $9,756,592. Sounds like a bargain, doesn't it?</p>
        <p>Consider the Twins</p>
        <p>And then, take the Minnesota Twins. Their payroll is less than the combined salaries of the left side of the Yankees' infield, Derek Jeter and Scott Brosius. Unlike other teams, the Twins did not add minor leaguers to their September roster. They have 25 players on their roster and one on the disabled list.</p>
        <p>The 26 players have combined salaries of $14,887,500. Eighteen of the 26 players have six-figure salaries that start with a 2. Eleven of those salaries range from the $200,000 minimum to $207,500.</p>
        <p>Years ago, when Calvin Griffith owned the Twins and the owners first began discussing revenue sharing, George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' big spender, said he would be willing to share his revenue if Griffith would allow him to aid in the operation of the Twins. If Carl Pohlad, the present Twins owner, let Steinbrenner help him, would the Twins have a $100 million payroll?</p>
        <p>Staying on Top Is Hard Part</p>
        <p>Flash: Braves Won't Finish First Forever!</p>
        <p>That startling revelation emerged from the mouth of Tom Glavine, the only active player who has been with Atlanta for every one of its eight consecutive division championships.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to win forever,'' the 34-year-old pitcher said. ''We're not going to win our division for the rest of baseball. Sometime we'll lose, but I hope it doesn't happen until after I'm not playing anymore.''</p>
        <p>Glavine offered that observation a few days after the Braves reclaimed first place in the National League East from the Mets. The Braves' second-place status on the last day of August and the first day of September made them appear to be mortal. It even had people raising the possibility of the Braves' being a wild-card entry in this year's playoffs.</p>
        <p>''I guess it creeps in there,'' Glavine said, when asked if the Braves ever think wild card and not first place. ''But your ultimate thinking is you want to win your division, do whatever you can to win your division. If you fall short, I guess you accept wild card and try to get to the World Series from that position.''</p>
        <p>If there had been any reason for the Braves to let wild-card thinking creep in, it seems to be gone now. The Mets just can't seem to deal with the prosperity of first place or being an inch away from first.</p>
        <p>''The Mets are a good ball club,'' said Glavine, a 19-game winner, who could also win his third Cy Young Award. ''They've been a good ball club. They've been a threat. They've done the same thing as we have. They've gotten better over the years. They've made changes before and after the trading deadline that improved their depth.''</p>
        <p>The challenge the Mets have mounted the last few seasons has been good for the Braves, Glavine added.</p>
        <p>''When you have somebody knocking on your door like that,'' he said, ''it tends to keep you focused and pushing hard for where you want to be, not to take things for granted. The closer the Mets get, we find a way to play better and win. It's the competition thing. It forces you to raise the level of your game so that you can achieve what you want to achieve.''</p>
        <p>Those Summertime Slides</p>
        <p>The Seattle Mariners had seemingly claimed first place in the American League West for themselves. A month ago they increased their lead to a season-high seven games. They had withstood Oakland's challenge, and they simply had to gain their share of victories the rest of the way.</p>
        <p>Maybe that was the Mariners' trouble. From that day to yesterday, the Mariners won seven games but lost 18, helplessly watching their lead dwindle to two games.</p>
        <p>The Mets pulled a version of the Mariners' slide. Since the day they snatched first place from the Braves, they have played eight games and lost seven.</p>
        <p>After tumbling out of first place the last day of July, then falling three games behind, the Arizona Diamondbacks rallied and, with the aid of a seven-game winning streak, pulled within half a game of first place in the N.L. West Aug. 20. Since then? They have won six, lost 11, falling as far back as eight and a half games.</p>
        <p>The Cincinnati Reds, one of the most disappointing teams this season, seemed to be headed in the right direction, finally, when they closed within four and a half games of first place in the N.L. Central. But after standing that close to first Aug. 13, they won 12 and lost 13.</p>
        <p>The Detroit Tigers, who lost 23 of their first 32 games, inched past .500, finally, on Sept. 1. When they won the next day, they were incredibly only four games behind in the wild-card race. Then they lost five of their next seven games and have slipped seven back.</p>
        <p>Chasing Milestones</p>
        <p>Todd Helton of Colorado did not have a good week in his quest to hit .400. He is down to .385, meaning if he goes to bat at the same ratio he has until now, he will have to hit .500 (38 for 76) to finish at .400. A week ago he had to hit only .449 the rest of the season to get there.</p>
        <p>A week ago, Darin Erstad of Anaheim had to average just under two hits a game to break George Sisler's record of 257 hits in a season (1920). He had a bad week, too. Now he has to average 2.25 hits a game to eclipse Sisler. He has 213 with 20 games left.</p>
        <p>NoOfficialInformation.com</p>
        <p>Major League Baseball, whose Internet site's name has been majorleaguebaseball.com, has gained the shorter version it had desired from a law firm with the same initials, mlb.com. But that does not mean its Internet policies will change with the name.</p>
        <p>When the site carries news articles about player contracts and salaries, financial details are first expunged. Chipper Jones signs a six-year extension with Atlanta for $90 million? Don't look for those numbers at mlb.com.</p>
        <p>The reason given? Baseball does not officially divulge player salary information, so even if it appears in, say, an Associated Press article, mlb.com will not be responsible for anyone learning the details on its Web site.</p>
