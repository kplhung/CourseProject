        <p>I returned from my one-week vacation the other day to find the cover of my mailbox ripped from its harness and destroyed.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I returned from my one-week vacation the other day to find the cover of my mailbox ripped from its harness and destroyed. When I went to my neighbor to get my week's mail, she informed me that the entire block's mailboxes were assaulted in this way. As I observed the damage done to myself and my neighbors, I was struck by the anger and aggression that would compel a person to commit such an act. It is a crime, and my neighbor reported it to the local police, who told her that there had been several such complaints.</p>
        <p>In my profession as a clinical psychologist, I am aware that this is not a rare occurrence in Westchester and other communities. Almost without exception these antisocial acts are committed by local youths, often under the influence of intoxicants, as expressions of anger and aggression. While some parents take vandalism and other forms of antisocial acts seriously and seek corrective measures, others, appallingly, are apathetic.</p>
        <p>Some parents justify their apathy by rationalizing that at least their children aren't into worse things. Some parents have no idea what their children are doing when they leave the home each day.</p>
        <p>In any event, this sort of behavior generally occurs when an individual is experiencing intense frustration and/or rage and has a weak capacity to cope with these feelings. The result is an expression in the form of antisocial acts. These behaviors should be viewed as cries for help. They are attempting to draw attention to their pain in the only way that they know to be heard.</p>
        <p>Continuing to disregard these expressions is likely to result in intensification of these cries for help with increasing destructiveness of behavior. If destruction of property is insufficient to draw attention to their need for help, then destruction to other persons may occur. This may result in frequent arguing with others and highly unstable relationships, self-destructive behaviors or felonious assault.</p>
        <p>This letter was written to implore parents to take note of their children's behaviors and take them seriously. Vandalism, such as breaking mailboxes, graffiti, and the like, is a sign of intense anger and aggression. Failure to address these behaviors will not make the problem disappear, rather it will exacerbate it. As a psychologist, as a parent and as your neighbor, I implore you that if your children manifest behaviors such as these, be prepared to seek professional help, as early intervention is most effective.</p>
