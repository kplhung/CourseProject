        <p>Harold Kaplan, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is an unpaid consultant to Gov. George W. Bush's campaign, said the ideal way to attack Vice President Al Gore popped into his head in late August when he was reading the obituary of the creator of the Lava Lamp.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Lava Lamp. Oh, my God! What a great visual!' '' Mr. Kaplan recalled. ''I thought a Lava Lamp was a very good metaphor for Gore. It can be whatever you want it to be.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaplan's script, which is part of the rhetorical ammunition the Bush campaign has stockpiled in Austin, Tex., opens with a bubbling, oozing Lava Lamp, intended to conjure images of debauchery in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>The announcer says: ''Some politicians are like Lava Lamps, constantly changing. Always saying what you want them to say. Take Al Gore, for example. He says he's now for tax cuts. That's enlightening. Over the last eight years, Al Gore voted to raise our gas taxes. Kept the marriage tax on couples. Even raised Social Security taxes.''</p>
        <p>This 30-second commercial was one of a series of suggested scripts obtained by The New York Times from people not involved in the campaign. The scripts were proposed by Madison Avenue advertising executives who are advising Mr. Bush's media team. They are nicknamed the ''Park Avenue Posse.''</p>
        <p>The Lava Lamp advertisement has never been broadcast. And it probably never will be.</p>
        <p>Mark McKinnon, Mr. Bush's top media adviser in Austin, was unapologetically dismissive of the commercial, saying: ''That's not nearly under consideration. I looked at it for about five seconds before I realized it wasn't worthy of consideration.''</p>
        <p>But the discussions about the advertisement -- no matter how fleeting -- underscore a fundamental predicament facing the Bush organization as it heads into the most intense eight weeks of advertising of the campaign. Campaign officials have concluded that they have no choice but to run advertisements attacking Mr. Gore -- and they have already started.</p>
        <p>Now they are facing the hard part: how to go negative without making the commercials appear too harsh. It is more of a challenge for Mr. Bush than for Mr. Gore because the Texas governor had vowed to run a campaign on a positive note.</p>
        <p>''The decision to even go negative has got to be a tough one for him,'' said Jane Hall, who teaches politics and the media at American University's school of communication. ''When he does, he turns himself into the carping Washington politician that he said he didn't want to be.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hall questioned the effectiveness of the Lava Lamp commercial, saying, ''To do a negative commercial saying he keeps changing is like fighting the last war. Gore has repackaged himself and seems to have sold himself as his own man.'' Besides, she added, ''I'm not sure people are even going to know what a Lava Lamp is. Isn't that the 60's or 70's?''</p>
        <p>Bush officials and consultants, and officials at the Republican National Committee, are wrestling with a variety of options, from a commercial that shows Mr. Gore turning into a chameleon to one questioning the validity of his budget plan.</p>
        <p>The campaign has convened endless meetings and focus groups to settle on how best to take on Mr. Gore. But the reality, according to several people involved in the process, is that there is no definitive strategy.</p>
        <p>''We're not sure what we're going to run next,'' conceded one Bush official in Austin. ''We have various things we're considering.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McKinnon insisted that there was a carefully considered strategy, saying, ''We have a very clear sense of direction.''</p>
        <p>But he acknowledged that striking the right tone was a challenge.</p>
        <p>''We have a sense of what voters think is fair, and produce ads accordingly,'' he said. ''You always want to try and produce something that is relevant and credible with voters.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaplan, a creative director at Young &amp; Rubicam who met Mr. Bush during the 1988 presidential campaign, spoke more bluntly about the problem facing the campaign: ''The struggle is that a negative ad can backfire on you. There's this harsh, mean tone that's wrong and you just don't want to do that. The governor has set a very positive tone.''</p>
        <p>Many Republican officials have criticized as too sarcastic a Republican Party commercial -- sanctioned by the Bush campaign -- that ridicules Mr. Gore with humor and cites his fund-raising visit to a Buddhist temple. But Mr. McKinnon defended the commercial and said, in fact, that it may have helped Mr. Bush close the gaps in some polls in the last week.</p>
        <p>''I can tell you from research that that ad tests very well,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican ad maker who was a strategist for Senator John McCain in the primaries, said it was difficult for any campaign to sort through ideas and settle on just the right tone of attack.</p>
        <p>''The problem you get in advertising is that much of the advice you get is very bad,'' said Mr. Murphy, who is now a strategist for the Senate candidacy of Representative Rick A. Lazio of New York. ''The hard part is being able to pick the very good from the overwhelmingly bad.''</p>
        <p>It has become something of a tradition for campaigns to look to Madison Avenue for creative input. In May, the Bush campaign formed the Park Avenue Posse, a group of advertising executives that has volunteered to advise Mr. McKinnon and his colleague in Austin, Stuart Stevens. The group is led by and was named for Jim Ferguson, the president of Young &amp; Rubicam, who lives on Park Avenue.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKinnon and Mr. Stevens are in frequent contact with members of the group, and have often taken their advice in developing commercials, particularly ones that ran early in the campaign.</p>
        <p>''They're very involved,'' Mr. McKinnon said. ''We have a political way of looking at things, and they're in a different box. They have fresh ideas.''</p>
        <p>Some of those ideas, like the Lava Lamp commercial, may seem a little too fresh for the Austin consultants.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKinnon not only discarded that commercial but other scripts from the posse.</p>
        <p>In one proposed advertisement, a chameleon flashes on the screen and the announcer says: ''This is a chameleon. It takes on the color of any place it is.''</p>
        <p>Then an image of Mr. Gore, frozen, appears. The announcer says, ''This is a politician, which does the same thing.''</p>
        <p>Then, footage of Mr. Gore recalling his days farming tobacco. ''I've shucked it, hucked it, sold it, smoked it,'' he says. Then the vice president says, ''I will never support the tobacco industry.''</p>
        <p>The announcer then says, ''Chameleon. Politician.''</p>
        <p>Then back to Mr. Gore, who says, ''I helped invent the Internet.''</p>
        <p>The announcer closes: ''Let's elect a leader this time. Not a politician.''</p>
        <p>Asked about that commercial, Mr. McKinnon said, ''It was something I instantly recognized as not worthy of consideration.'' He would not elaborate on why he objected to the advertisements.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKinnon had little patience for suggested commercials that tethered Mr. Gore to the Clinton administration's doomed health care plan.</p>
        <p>''Remember the health care crisis in '93?'' the announcer says in one proposed ad. ''Clinton and Gore promised a plan that would put a national health care card in every wallet. Still waiting for yours?'' Someone on the screen is shaking a wallet with no card in it.</p>
        <p>Defending his judgments, Mr. McKinnon said, ''I've got 150 scripts lying around here.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Kaplan, who has handled accounts for the Army and Kentucky Fried Chicken, said he was ''just shocked'' that his and other scripts leaked to the press. ''I've been so good about guarding our secrets.'' And he was still hoping that the lava spot would be produced and broadcast.</p>
        <p>''I still think we may produce it,'' he said. ''But who knows?''</p>
