        <p>KEVIN SMITH  Producer of the short-lived ABC series ''Clerks''</p>
        <p>I'M not a football fan, by any stretch of the imagination, but when I heard that Dennis Miller was going to be one of the commentators on ''Monday Night Football,'' it actually made me want to watch. It's a big stretch, too, for me, because I hate ABC. I guess it kind of speaks highly of someone who's willing to take a chance.</p>

        <p>KEVIN SMITH  Producer of the short-lived ABC series ''Clerks''</p>
        <p>I'M not a football fan, by any stretch of the imagination, but when I heard that Dennis Miller was going to be one of the commentators on ''Monday Night Football,'' it actually made me want to watch. It's a big stretch, too, for me, because I hate ABC. I guess it kind of speaks highly of someone who's willing to take a chance.</p>
        <p>I'll still be tuning in to Fox; this may be ''The X-Files' '' last season. And, of course, ''The Simpsons'' continues to be the best show on television. But the network I watch is A&amp;E because they're willing to pop on every old episode of ''Law and Order'' that exists. I live for it, man. That's an example of a network that doesn't have to change their programming a bit. Two opportunities a day to see two different episodes? That's genius. That's fantastic.</p>
        <p>CARL REINER  Actor, writer, producer, director</p>
        <p>I'M looking forward to reality shows disappearing by their own weight. By people saying to each other, ''Hey, I could ride the subway with a good hearing aid and hear these kinds of conversations.'' The other reason I really want them to fail is that the people are so greedy. They're terrible. People becoming friends so they can throw each other off? It's crazy. That's not entertainment to me. But art always reflects society. We all have that little sense of voyeurism in us -- that's why these shows are successful.</p>
        <p>My wife and I love courtroom dramas. ''Judging Amy'' is a very well-written show, and so is ''Family Law'' and ''The Practice.'' When you get of a certain age, you don't want to miss anything. You do two or three things at once. Shows that interest me, I watch with full attention. Fairly interesting shows, I make sure I have a crossword puzzle. During a game show, maybe I'll finish the Op-Ed section. I do love ''Jeopardy'' and ''Wheel of Fortune.'' We like seeing people walk off happy.</p>
        <p>DEBBIE MATENOPOULOS  Host on the TV Guide channel; formerly of the ABC morning program ''The View''</p>
        <p>MY favorite show, hands down, is ''Sex and the City.'' I can't think of one show that sums up single life in Manhattan more than that show. That's my girlfriends and I. I've no idea what it's going to be like, but I can't wait for ''Grosse Pointe.'' It's going to be my guilty pleasure. Darren Star is so daring. He's sort of like the John Waters of the small screen. Mental, sick and wrong, but very funny. I also love ''The X-Files.'' People haven't been loyal. But I'm sticking by them to the end. It'll be interesting to see what it's like when it's just Scully. It'll force the writers to come up with fresher story lines.</p>
        <p>Do I watch morning television? Being completely honest, I do not. I think it would probably be unhealthy. It's like you learn, you grow, you move on. To bigger and better things, hopefully.</p>
        <p>STEVE HARVEY  Star of ''The Steve Harvey Show'' on WB</p>
        <p>I LIKE ''The Sopranos,''  ''Politically Incorrect'' and ''Nightline.'' But to be honest with you, the only show I look forward to in the new fall season is my own. And I'm not just saying that. Not that long ago, I was sitting in a coffee shop with some friends and they had the Life section of USA Today, covering the networks' announcements of the fall lineups. They said ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' was this night. ''Roswell'' would be that night. It listed each show. Then when it got to me, Jamie Foxx, ''The PJs'' and ''For Your Love,'' it just said, ''All the black-themed shows will be moved to Sunday night.'' Period. They didn't even have the decency to mention our names.</p>
        <p>That, to me, is just horrific. That type of media coverage and pigeonholing has to stop. Do you think that just because I'm black I don't work hard and try to turn out a quality project? I do. We're in our fifth season; that's a rare plateau in the television world. What I look forward to in the fall season is to just being thought of as a good show.</p>
        <p>GERVASE PETERSON  Survivor</p>
        <p>I'VE got a big 62-inch TV. So that's what I do. I watch a lot of TV. ''Friends,''  ''Will and Grace,''  ''Oz,''  ''Sex and the City.'' I'm looking forward to ''The Fugitive.'' I can't wait for ''The X-Files'' to come back. I don't need Mulder. I love Gillian Anderson. I'm a big fan of hers. I'm a huge ''Dawson's Creek'' fan. I like the characters, just seeing the things they do in a relationship and how crazy they act. I love Joey. I like Pacey. But Dawson? He was kind of cool at the beginning, but then he got so stupid. It doesn't seem like he's going anywhere. He can't figure out what he wants to do. Joey was the perfect girl for him -- first, they were friends, then they took it to another level. And he messed up the whole thing! I know Dawson is the main character, but I'd love to see him go. Dawson needs to just leave town, go to college, do his movie thing.</p>
        <p>And I'll definitely be watching ''Survivor 2.'' I can't wait to see how they cast it. Will there be doubles of us? Will you see another Gervase? Another Dirk? Another Joel? Or will you just see 16 totally new people with totally different attitudes?</p>
        <p>GAIL BERMAN  President for entertainment, Fox Broadcasting Company</p>
        <p>THIS is my first fall as a network president, so all I want to know is how each individual show on our network is going to perform. For me, it's very nerve-racking and intensely exciting. Obviously, my heart is in the return of ''Malcolm in the Middle,'' because I was involved in the creation of it. My daughter's former favorite show is ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' Fascinatingly enough, her new favorite show is ''Malcolm in the Middle.'' I have her right in the palm of my hand!</p>
        <p>I love watching television with my husband and children. My kids are my own focus group. I watch a lot of Nickelodeon with them. I've learned a lot from the ''Wild Thornberrys'' and ''Hey, Arnold!'' They're enormously informative about what young people are watching before growing into adult viewers. They're very sophisticated programs; emotionally based, really, really good cartoons.</p>
        <p>How many weeks will I have the jitters? If something breaks through, I think that will calm me down some. If it doesn't, I'll imagine I'll jitter all the way through to winter.</p>
        <p>TERRY SWEENEY  Creator and executive producer of the WB sketch-comedy series ''Hype''</p>
        <p>AS a sketch writer, all you look forward to is what looks terrible. ''The Bette Midler Show'' looks like it's going to be a camp-fest. I was looking forward to ''The Michael Richards Show.'' But he should have done a ''Frasier.'' Just been Kramer. That's what people want to see him as. I mean, it's already being ''retooled.'' And you know what that means: ''The premise isn't working and it never did, but we spent so much money, we can't turn back now.''</p>
        <p>Some of the old shows are wearing themselves out. It'll be fun to spoof  ''Ally McBeal,'' which ran out of plots about a season and a half ago. There's no plot left. Nothing. It's just ridiculous fantasy sequences and the characters have lost their minds and it's just unraveling before our very eyes. I think they should have exited gracefully. Maybe Ally could have been hit by a bus and that would be the end. Just this bony little hand sticking out of the snow with Vonda Shepherd singing. I actually like ''West Wing'' a lot. I love the way the shows are so human and funny and smart. I love Allison Janney. She makes that series as far as I'm concerned.</p>
