        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The front-page article of Sept. 3 (''Becoming Fed Up With Zero Tolerance'') accurately depicts some of the problems surrounding school policies and procedures.</p>
        <p>As the author of ''Guide for School-Based Drug Policy and Advisory Councils,'' I have collected many such examples.</p>
        <p>It is important to accurately define the unfairly maligned term ''zero  tolerance.'' Zero tolerance was originally conceived to reduce the problem of inconsistent policy enforcement. This term simply means that an institution has established predetermined consequences for predetermined infractions or inappropriate behaviors.</p>
        <p>For instance, a school policy may clearly state that the first time students brings a knife to school, they are immediately suspended for five days with an administrative hearing, and referred to counseling and conflict-mediation services. There may be escalating consequences for each  additional infraction. All students who exhibit the prohibited behavior  are treated the same way.</p>
        <p>This zero tolerance approach reduces inconsistency, favoritism and unequal enforcement. But does the policy define ''knife?'' If not, what happens when a middle-school student brings a small butter knife to school to spread peanut butter on crackers?</p>
        <p>Zero tolerance is not the problem; the problem lies in the policies and  procedures themselves. Policies must be very carefully developed,  using a committee of stakeholders that includes parents, students,  school staff, counselors, law enforcement and others. Terms must be  defined. Detailed implementation procedures must also be developed, and everything must be reviewed by a competent legal advisor.</p>
        <p>When complete, the policies and procedures must be widely publicized and disseminated, so everyone knows parameters, and understands his or her responsibilities. Most important, all school staff must be thoroughly trained and prepared to implement the policies.</p>
        <p>It is clear that more thorough attention to policies and procedures will result in better outcomes, more public support and less negative publicity.</p>
