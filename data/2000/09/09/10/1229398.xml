        <p>The debate is over. Let the debates begin.</p>
        <p>For much of the week, the Bush and Gore campaigns sparred over where and how -- or even whether -- the presidential debates would occur this year. The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which has been running the forums since 1988, had issued invitations to Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore to three debates on college campuses in October.</p>
        <p>But last Sunday, Mr. Bush issued a debate plan of his own that included only one 90-minute commission debate and added 60-minute showdowns on ''Meet the Press'' and ''Larry King Live.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, however, with Democrats accusing Mr. Bush of wanting to duck the wider television audiences commanded by the commission debates -- and Republicans increasingly worried that voters might be seeing it that way, too -- Mr. Bush withdrew his plan. This week, aides to both candidates are to meet in Washington with the commission to negotiate a final deal that guarantees a series of forums.</p>
        <p>All the talk about talking was the dominant story of the first week of campaigning after Labor Day, traditionally the kickoff of the final leg of the election. It easily overshadowed the governor's announcement of the details of his prescription drug proposal on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's $198 billion overhaul of Medicare would encourage the elderly to pick subsidized private insurance plans that had prescription drug coverage. Mr. Gore, who previously unveiled his own $253 billion plan, said Mr. Bush's subsidies were not sufficient for older people.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Gore still in the throes of a post-convention surge, Mr. Bush's advisers unveiled a retooled strategy and message, focused on a new theme: ''Real plans for real people.'' The idea is to get Mr. Bush mixing more with ''real people'' at town hall meetings and in workplace chats.</p>
