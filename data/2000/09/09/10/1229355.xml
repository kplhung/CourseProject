        <p>DEATH warmed over: That is how one analyst has described the battered long-distance and local telephone sector of the telecommunications industry. In a sharp reversal, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 communications services index, which rose 18.2 percent last year, has dropped 28.9 percent from a mid-December high, to 173.55.</p>
        <p>Telephone stocks climbed last year, and a bit this spring, on excitement about mergers and the entry of local carriers into long-distance service.

        <p>DEATH warmed over: That is how one analyst has described the battered long-distance and local telephone sector of the telecommunications industry. In a sharp reversal, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 communications services index, which rose 18.2 percent last year, has dropped 28.9 percent from a mid-December high, to 173.55.</p>
        <p>Telephone stocks climbed last year, and a bit this spring, on excitement about mergers and the entry of local carriers into long-distance service. But Wall Street has done  an about-face on the sector, focusing on the dilution caused by acquisitions, on higher-than-expected capital needs and on fear that competition will put pressure on profits.</p>
        <p>Yet, many analysts say, the sector's hammering has been overdone and indiscriminate. ''Investors tend to machine-gun the whole group,'' said F. Drake Johnstone of Davenport &amp; Company. That means that there may be good buys among the rubble. And for those who already own some of these stocks, it may be wise to hold on.</p>
        <p>The ever-changing playing field can be difficult to follow. Qwest absorbed U S West, a Baby Bell, this summer, but not before U S West's cable arm, the MediaOne Group, was bought by AT&amp;T, which shed the Baby Bells in 1984. AT&amp;T, now the long-distance giant, has moved heavily into cable, while would-be competitors are forming joint ventures. BellSouth and SBC Communications, meanwhile, are combining wireless operations in a new stock.</p>
        <p>Investors can no longer distinguish companies by services -- long-distance and local telephone, wireless service and land lines, digital data and video. Each company wants to provide the whole package. ''These folks are trying to hang onto as much of the old business as they can and get as much of the new,'' said Thomas Wolzien, who follows the cable industry for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. ''Everyone is trying to eat everyone else's lunch.''</p>
        <p>Who will end up with big lunches? Bruce Behrens, co-manager of the $2.3-billion Flag Investors Communication fund, favors companies that were traditionally in local service. ''The idea of long-distance versus local is an artifact of regulation,'' Mr. Behrens said. With fiber optics, phone companies pay little more to carry calls for long distances than short, he added, and local carriers are better positioned to woo new customers.</p>
        <p>He and his co-manager, Liam Burke, along with other analysts, like SBC. In the first six weeks that the company offered long-distance service in Texas, it signed up a half-million customers, and it may hit a million by the end of the year. The company is aggressively rolling out digital subscriber line technology, or D.S.L., to transmit high-speed Internet data over phone lines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burke likes SBC's strategy of using joint ventures to get into cellular and long-distance services. ''It shows sensitivity to capital expenditures,'' Mr. Burke said. SBC is trading at $45.06, 18.8 percent off its 52-week high of $55.50, and at 17.3 times next year's projected earnings of $2.60 a share. That compares with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.9 for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</p>
        <p>BELLSOUTH, meanwhile, has generally retained analysts' confidence, but it has raised some concerns, with a failed bid for the Sprint Corporation last fall, for example. And the company's slow rollout of D.S.L. has troubled analysts, too. Mr. Johnstone advises holding BellSouth, to see if it can accelerate D.S.L. installations. The stock is trading at $40, down from a high of $53.50 in April.</p>
        <p>He also advises holding Verizon Communications, although some fund managers call it an attractive buy. Verizon, the combination of Bell Atlantic and GTE, is also slow in rolling out D.S.L., he said. ''Part of the game is how quickly you can provide these services,'' he said. When consumers have no  D.S.L. alternative, cable companies jump in to offer cable modem Internet service along with video and telephone.</p>
        <p>Verizon is under attack from competitors in its business-laden territories in New York, Washington and Baltimore. It recently raised its expected capital needs for this year and next to $18 billion, from $13 billion. The stock, which traded at $66 in April, is now at $44.31.</p>
        <p>Mr. Behrens and Mr. Burke say the big long-distance players -- AT&amp;T, Sprint and WorldCom -- face fundamental problems as boundaries disappear between long-distance and local calling. But they are worth more than their current severely depressed stock prices, Mr. Behrens added. ''All these companies do have assets that can work for them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T's residential long-distance revenue was down last quarter, and revenue from its business segment was also weak. Standard &amp; Poor's warned last month that it might cut the company's gilt-edged credit and debt ratings because of ''concerns regarding AT&amp;T's cable television strategy, long-term prospects for AT&amp;T's core long-distance business, a more aggressive wireless expansion plan, and its overall strategic direction.'' AT&amp;T recently began offering five months of free cable service to meet year-end goals for new customers, but the question is whether those customers will stay after the free period, Mr. Johnstone said. He recommends a wait-and-see approach.</p>
        <p>However, David M. Goldsmith at the Buckingham Research Group said investors should be focusing on AT&amp;T's long-term picture. ''The company is undervalued because people are focusing on the short term,'' Mr. Goldsmith said.</p>
        <p>The shares closed Friday at $30.25, down 39.8 percent for the year. AT&amp;T Wireless, which trades as a separate stock, has been strong.</p>
        <p>WORLDCOM, thwarted in its attempt to acquire Sprint, wants to turn its focus to business customers. The company, aiming to expand into Web hosting -- services and infrastructure to support Web sites -- said last week that it had agreed to buy Intermedia Communications, which holds a majority of Digex Inc., a Web hosting company.</p>
        <p>Also last week, WorldCom executives warned that revenue for the next few years would drop below previous expectations. In light of the announcements, Mr. Johnstone changed his recommendation from buy to hold. He favors Qwest among long-distance carriers.</p>
        <p>WorldCom hit a 52-week low of $32.56 in August and now trades at $29.94, 16.1 times projected earnings for next year.</p>
        <p>Many analysts favor challengers like Global Crossing -- but expect the entire sector to pick up soon. ''I can't imagine it going much lower,'' Mr. Burke said.</p>
