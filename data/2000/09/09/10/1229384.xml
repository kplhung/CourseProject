        <p>FOR a short but trying time a few years ago, this town made national headlines. Horrifying stories had emerged from the Mitsubishi automobile assembly plant that sits amid the fertile cornfields here. On its factory floor, some workers contended, some men felt free to grope women or to ask them to bare their breasts. Men would display lewd photographs and commonly refer to women in the crudest of terms, workers said.</p>
        <p>Mitsubishi was accused by some of its own workers of ignoring -- even encouraging -- such behavior. In 1996, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission brought the largest harassment suit in its history against the company, contending that hundreds of women were victimized, going back to at least 1990. The Rev. Jesse Jackson later led a consumer boycott, and the National Organization for Women organized pickets at Mitsubishi dealers.</p>
        <p>The company, which had vehemently denied the accusations, agreed in June 1998 to settle the suit by paying $34 million to women who said they had been harassed. That followed its settlement a year earlier of a private suit, involving similar accusations, for about $10 million. The settlements were supposed to have started a new chapter at Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America, which agreed to take a series of steps to stop harassment.</p>
        <p>Although the headlines have faded, many problems have not. In interviews, current and former Mitsubishi workers painted a disturbing portrait of a factory that often remained deeply hostile toward women. Some workers said harassment remained a serious problem, despite a ''zero tolerance'' policy against sexual harassment that Mitsubishi said it had in place even before the settlement. Many other workers declined to talk about the issue, and few employees were willing to speak on the record about life at the plant.</p>
        <p>Those who agreed to interviews did say that the most extreme forms of harassment had apparently ended, and that the number of incidents had declined sharply. But disturbing events have continued, according to these employees. One woman, who had been involved in the government's settlement, was the target of offensive drawings, a co-worker said. Another woman accused a male co-worker of tampering with cars on the assembly line just before they reached her. And the rude language continues unabated, employees said.</p>
        <p>Some workers were also harshly critical of how Mitsubishi handles complaints, despite the company's promises to make it easier for employees to come forward.</p>
        <p>Sharon Burmaster is one of several workers who expressed bitter disappointment. Women still worry about retaliation, she said, asserting that the department that handles harassment accusations is largely ineffective. ''We thought we were making a difference, and we didn't,'' said Ms. Burmaster, who is on disability leave from the plant.</p>
        <p>THE Mitsubishi experience resonates far beyond this town. The size and notoriety of the case  could be seen as a test of how effectively the federal government and private lawsuits can force change on recalcitrant corporations. If Mitsubishi is unable to address fundamental tensions at its plant, despite the government's insistence on specific changes and monitoring, what hope is there for companies that get less press and government attention?</p>
        <p>The question is especially apt now. Last Wednesday, a three-member panel, chosen by the company and the employment commission to monitor the plant, issued its second annual report. The 20-page paper credited the company with making ''commendable progress.'' Mitsubishi ''has sexual harassment in the plant firmly under control,'' the report concluded.</p>
        <p>The E.E.O.C. has also declared victory. ''My sense is that we have made a dramatic difference,'' said John C. Hendrickson, the lead lawyer for the commission in the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Both Mitsubishi and the commission dismiss naysayers as unrepresentative of employees at the plant. They say the monitors held extensive interviews and uncovered no serious problems. Just 30 complaints, sometimes by more than one individual about the same incident, were filed with the company from December 1999 to August of this year, the monitors reported. Six resulted in recommendations of disciplinary action. The company says a dozen individuals have made complaints so far this year -- a rate that is slightly lower than the 22 for all of 1997.</p>
        <p>But for some employees -- and not just women -- the plant remains a troubled and uncomfortable place to work. In January, Patricia Benassi, a lawyer who represented women in the private lawsuit, filed a suit contending racial discrimination. She now represents about 40 former and current employees who are black.</p>
        <p>The company has ''made it clear that African-Americans were unwanted and despised,'' the suit contends. It describes instances of racial taunts, of ''K.K.K.'' being scrawled on walls and of nooses on display. Because the suit is in mediation, both sides declined to comment, although Mitsubishi has said that it does not tolerate harassment of any kind.</p>
        <p>Why do some employees still describe the plant as an unfriendly place to work, despite the company's oft-stated policies against offensive behavior?</p>
        <p>Changing any corporate culture, whether in management offices or on the factory floor, is extraordinarily difficult. Too often, companies ''fail to follow up,'' said Ellen Bravo, the co-director of 9 to 5, National Association of Working Women. They fail to ensure that their workplace no longer fosters or permits offensive behavior, she added.</p>
        <p>''The kind of atmosphere where sexual harassment flourishes is not only where there is a general atmosphere of hostility and problems,'' she said, ''but where workers do not trust top management.'' In Mitsubishi's case, Ms. Bravo faults the company for not fully acknowledging the depth of its problems.</p>
        <p>But Mitsubishi says its focus is on the future. ''We're trying to move on. That was then; this is now,'' said Gloria-Jeanne Davis, who heads the Mitsubishi plant's opportunity programs department, which was created in 1996 to oversee complaints.</p>
        <p>THE company's employees do say that Mitsubishi has put an end to much of the most blatant harassment. It has fired workers that it concluded were harassing women, and it is doing what it can to prevent incidents, according to one employee whose wife had complained of harassment when she worked there.</p>
        <p>Union officials at the plant also say that there has been significant progress. ''It's definitely changed,'' said Justin West, the president of United Auto Workers Local 2488, which had been criticized by employees a few years ago as being slow to address sexual-harassment concerns. ''Are there still pockets of some resistance? It goes on,'' he said, but he emphasized that both the company and the union wanted to put an end to that kind of behavior.</p>
        <p>What is troubling to some Mitsubishi employees is not that there are incidents -- few, if any, workplaces are free of them -- but that they feel as powerless now as they did before the settlement. They say that investigations are not kept confidential and that little effort is made to get to the source of problems. And after making complaints, they say, they are often transferred to other areas of the plant -- where they must learn new, sometimes more difficult, jobs.</p>
        <p>Mitsubishi, they contend, focuses only on the most obvious outbreaks of hostility rather than tackling an environment that may foster it.</p>
        <p>If a company does not address underlying reasons causing trouble in its workplace, ''you could expect other problems; you could predict it,'' said Robert Bruno, a labor relations professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who has studied the Mitsubishi plant.</p>
        <p>Mitsubishi officials, who defend their handling of complaints, say women workers are moved permanently to other areas only with their consent. They denied that there was a systemic problem at the plant. ''In order to have a good-quality product, we have to have a quality environment,'' Ms. Davis said.</p>
        <p>In the 15 years since Mitsubishi joined with Chrysler, now DaimlerChrysler, to plan operations here, the plant has become integral to life in both Normal and Bloomington, which are known as the twin cities. Mitsubishi bought out Chrysler's 50 percent stake in the plant in 1991.</p>
        <p>Mitsubishi is a leading employer in the area, which also boasts two universities and the headquarters of State Farm Insurance. Even after letting go of about 750 workers last year as part of a downsizing, the plant employs roughly 3,100 people.</p>
        <p>And the jobs at the plant pay well: even without much overtime, a line worker, earning about $24 a hour, can easily make $50,000 a year, which goes far in central Illinois.</p>
        <p>The twin cities bask in pride as the home of Mitsubishi's only United States plant. The company figured prominently in a recent manufacturing exhibit at the McLean County Museum of History in downtown Bloomington, and the local newspaper, The Pantagraph, closely covers the company.</p>
        <p>The plant produces three Mitsubishi models -- the Eclipse sports coupe, the Spyder convertible and the Galant sedan -- and two Chrysler models -- the Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring. It expects to make a record 228,000 cars this year.</p>
        <p>Though a money-loser for most of its history, the plant began turning a profit last year, according to Richard Gilligan, a former Ford manager who became chief operating officer at Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America in December 1998.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the company's Japanese parent, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, came to grips with its own problems: After acknowledging that it had hidden consumer complaints about defects in its Japanese-made cars for two decades, Katsuhiko Kawasoe, the chief executive, said he would resign. And DaimlerChrysler, which has agreed to buy 34 percent of the company, said it would it take a more active management role.</p>
        <p>THEN the plant opened here  in 1988, workers were recruited with promises of high pay and a Japanese-style team approach to building cars. The employees, called associates, would work side by side with managers.</p>
        <p>The factory floor, built about two-thirds the typical size for an auto plant, was intended as a model of efficiency. But employees also describe it as a cramped, noisy place where one worker may have to squeeze past another to get into a car or to find tools. The company uses a production system in which workers depend on one another to complete a group of tasks in an allotted time.</p>
        <p>With production on a record pace, employees routinely work 10-hour shifts, six days a week, with every third Saturday off. The long hours contribute to difficult working conditions. ''There are hostilities in the plant,'' said Mr. West, the union president. ''People are reaching the boiling point.''</p>
        <p>Many employees contend that supervisors encourage workers to give one another a hard time if they do not keep up -- fomenting antagonistic comments. ''The management actually pits worker against worker,'' asserted Larry Lehmann, a former union representative who no longer works at the plant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilligan denied that the work environment was unusually hostile. ''This is a tough industry, and it's not for everyone,'' he said.</p>
        <p>AS in most other auto plants, women and minorities stand out here as easy targets. In a sea of Mitsubishi maroon shirts and gray slacks, the uniform worn by all employees on the factory floor, the faces are mostly those of white men. About one-fifth of the employees are women, about the same as before the settlement, according to Ms. Davis.</p>
        <p>What distinguishes the Mitsubishi plant, however, is the disappointment that workers feel about working there. Despite the promises made in the early years by management, employees say they have little involvement in making important decisions about how the line will be run. While many expected something different, the jobs here are typical assembly-line work, monotonous and often physically grueling.</p>
        <p>''They really do feel cheated,'' said Mr. Bruno, who surveyed the work force in the fall of 1997.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, some women complained of sexual harassment, but employees said that the atmosphere grew worse over the years,  and that management ignored the accusations. As the complaints became public, first in the private lawsuit filed by about 30 women in December 1994 and later as part of the E.E.O.C. suit, employees were sharply divided. The company responded aggressively, busing thousands of employees to hold a rally in Chicago to protest the commission's suit.</p>
        <p>Even today, many employees deny that there was ever a significant problem. ''There was a lot of teasing going on,'' said Kathleen McLouth, who has worked at the plant for 12 years. She described the accusations of sexual harassment as ''blown way out of proportion.''</p>
        <p>Some white men who work at the plant complain bitterly that there is now a double standard, asserting that the company ignores provocative behavior by women and minorities. One man who spoke only on condition of anonymity said he thought the plant had gone too far in catering to their demands. ''The way I look at, you know what a factory is all about,'' he said. ''They're trying to turn it into a Sunday school.''</p>
        <p>The 1998 settlement, which involved nearly 500 women at the plant, appears to have sharpened some of the resentment. The women were never identified, but when local newspapers said they received from $11,000 to as much as $300,000 each, there was heated speculation about which women had received money and how much.</p>
        <p>One woman recalled being barraged by questions. Later, she said, after being overheard talking to another woman about the settlement, she became the target of harassment by a male colleague. She said the man interfered with her work by tampering with a car before it came down the line and tried to intimidate her by startling her with loud noises. She said that when she tried to resolve the matter through the opportunity programs department, she was told that it was partly her fault for making it known that she was involved in the settlement. The matter is not yet resolved.</p>
        <p>The employment commission did advise women not to talk about the settlement, and Ms. Davis said that the company had a strict policy forbidding employees to discuss it.</p>
        <p>The company's handling of complaints is also criticized sharply by some employees, who say Mitsubishi has not made it any easier to come forward. They contend that investigations quickly become known throughout the plant, even if inadvertently. One employee said, for example, that someone who is accused of harassment is removed from the assembly line to be interviewed on the very same day the accuser is removed.</p>
        <p>With so little effort to disguise what is happening, ''the line knows you've narked on him,'' she said. Employees also say that the union members who participate in the proceedings may be indiscreet, too.</p>
        <p>The company says it strives to keep the proceedings private, and George F. Galland Jr., a plaintiffs' lawyer in the original suit who is now a monitor, says that there is little else Mitsubishi can do. The union says its members also understand the importance of keeping matters confidential.</p>
        <p>Much of the employee dissatisfaction is aimed squarely at the opportunity programs department. Some of that may be based on prejudice -- the department is staffed primarily with blacks and has no white men, which some employees say makes them uncomfortable. Others say the department routinely fails to get to the bottom of the problems on the factory floor.</p>
        <p>The department ''was a smokescreen,'' said Mr. Lehmann, the former union representative, who faulted the department for not doing more to investigate certain incidents.</p>
        <p>One investigation, into a harassment complaint made by a woman  after the government settlement,  also resulted in no action. A man denied accusations that he had drawn an unflattering picture that depicted the woman's body as made of dollar bills. The matter was dropped without much effort to learn what had really happened, according to an employee who was involved in the proceedings.</p>
        <p>Ms. Davis, however, said that the department thoroughly investigated any complaint, and that when a definitive conclusion could not be reached, the department continued to monitor the situation.</p>
        <p>Some of the inability to get beyond a he-said, she-said recounting of incidents rests too much on Mitsubishi's reliance on reports of fellow workers, according to some employees. Not much can be done if there is no witness to a complaint, they say. And supervisors provide little of the oversight needed to address problems brewing on the line, especially now  that they face greater work demands as the plant produces more cars. ''They used to be there and they turned their back,'' one employee said. ''Now they're not there.''</p>
        <p>And when co-workers do see problems, they are often reluctant to become involved, especially if someone might be fired for his behavior.</p>
        <p>The three monitors -- a former E.E.O.C. official who serves as a consultant to Mitsubishi, the research director of a Chicago women's organization, and Mr. Galland -- have pushed the company to address complaints even when they are not clear-cut cases.</p>
        <p>Women at the plant say they have few places to turn. The union's ability to handle complaints is limited; the shop stewards cannot leave the assembly line to look into problems. That leaves the bulk of the responsibility with union representatives, each of whom handles the complaints and concerns of several hundred people. The representatives are also conflicted, some workers said, because they must protect the interests of the accused as well as the accuser.</p>
        <p>Some employees said the monitors failed to pick up on these concerns because the process of interviewing employees was flawed. Some employees who want to be interviewed have to notify a supervisor about their need to leave the line, thus calling attention to themselves.</p>
        <p>MR. GALLAND said the process offered the confidentiality that employees wanted. By interviewing employees at random, as well as those who ask to participate, supervisors have no idea who has volunteered, he said. Workers can also call him directly, he said.</p>
        <p>For its part, the E.E.O.C. stated that there would always be some discontent at any plant. ''We never expected we were creating an industrial utopia in Bloomington-Normal,'' said Mr. Hendrickson, who added that he was unaware of any complaints directed to his office.</p>
        <p>Apart from the monitors, few outsiders are paying much attention. Lynn Martin, the former Labor Secretary hired by as a consultant about workplace issues after the government sued Mitsubishi, and her three-person staff spent two years at Mitsubishi and were paid $2 million for their efforts. She stopped checking on the status of her recommendations to create a model workplace once the settlement agreement was reached, a spokesman said.</p>
        <p>N.O.W. and Mr. Jackson's group say they have not received complaints. Patricia Ireland, the president of N.O.W., said, ''The best sign is that we have not heard cries from women for help there.''</p>
        <p>But some workers at the plant have another interpretation of the situation. They wonder whether anyone is listening hard enough.</p>
