      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Abandoned cemeteries, mossy tombstones, weary gravediggers leaning on their shovels: anyone familiar with the work of Eudora Welty will not find the subject matter of her latest book particularly unusual. What may come as a surprise is that the content is not prose but photography. COUNTRY CHURCHYARDS (University Press of Mississippi, $35) is a slim book of nearly 100 black-and-white photographs of Mississippi cemeteries. Welty took the pictures more than 50 years ago, long before she became known for her novels and short stories, many of which included just the kinds of settings depicted here. Several of the pictures are accompanied by quotations from Welty's writings. A line from her novel ''Losing Battles'' was apparently inspired by a bleak graveyard near Natchez: ''An army of tablets, some black as slate, marked half a hill-load of husbands and wives buried close together.'' Welty's interest in graveyards predates her passion for both photography and fiction. As a child, she played in the Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Miss., where she grew up. ''For me cemeteries had a sinister appeal somehow,'' Welty told Hunter Cole in an interview that serves as a preface to the book. But eventually she started taking aesthetic note of the marble effigies and solemn stone angels that inhabited the graveyards of the old country churches surrounding Jackson. All of it appealed to what Elizabeth Spencer, who wrote the introduction to the book, calls Welty's ''sense of reverence for life's mysteries, death being one of those.''</p>
