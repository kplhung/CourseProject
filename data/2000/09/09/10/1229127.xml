        <p>ZAYAS-Richard. Of Brooklyn Heights, NY, left this world on September 8. A graduate of Midwood High School, Brooklyn, and Harvard College, he also attended Harvard Business School and was a management consultant. Formerly served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Empire State Pride Agenda and helped elect the first openly gay member of the New York City Council. Few people enjoyed life as much as Richard. A lover of music, he could dance the night away. A man of great intelligence and charm, he profoundly touched everyone who knew him. Richard is survived by his partner of eight and-a-half years Dick Dadey; his parents, Betsy Padin Jackson and Louis Zayas; his brother, Louis, Jr.; his sister, Melody; his grandmother, Ramonita Detres; and many loving aunts, uncles and cousins. Visitation is on Monday, September 11, from 4-8 PM, at St. Boniface Church, 75 Duffield St, Brooklyn. Funeral mass on Tuesday, September 12, 10 AM, at St. Boniface. Call 212-809-2657 for specific directions and further information about arrangements. Contributions can be made to CallenLorde Health Center, 356 W. 18 St, NY NY 10011.</p>
        <p>ZAYAS-Richard. The Bo ard and staff of the Empire State Pride Agenda mourn the passing of Richard Zayas, our good friend and colleague.
