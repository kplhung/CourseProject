        <p>THE old film story has a crew shooting a car on top of a mountain. It is the ''magic hour'' shot, which is to say, sunset. The shot is set up when the location manager says, ''This spot is good, but the spot 100 yards away is superb.''</p>
        <p>Everyone schleps over, and there, on a promontory, is the most magnificent view in the world -- the valley stretches away below, all is perfect save the one pine tree occupying the only space to put the product. They chop down the tree, put the car there, get the shot and repair to the local airport.</p>

        <p>THE old film story has a crew shooting a car on top of a mountain. It is the ''magic hour'' shot, which is to say, sunset. The shot is set up when the location manager says, ''This spot is good, but the spot 100 yards away is superb.''</p>
        <p>Everyone schleps over, and there, on a promontory, is the most magnificent view in the world -- the valley stretches away below, all is perfect save the one pine tree occupying the only space to put the product. They chop down the tree, put the car there, get the shot and repair to the local airport.</p>
        <p>Everyone is having a drink, waiting for the plane, and the bartender says, ''You folks look happy.''</p>
        <p>''Happy?'' the director says. ''Of course we're happy. We just shot at the most beautiful vista I have ever seen.''</p>
        <p>''Oh,'' says the bartender, ''you must have been up on Lone Pine Ridge.''</p>
        <p>Priceless film lore. Van humor.</p>
        <p>Most films are made on location, and location shooting means hundreds of hours in the van. We pile into the van to scout locations, to revisit chosen locations with the Art Department, to revisit with the Director of Photography and the Storyboard Artist, to revisit with Locations, Stunts, Effects. . . . Four hours a day five days a week times 10 weeks of preproduction is 200 hours in the van; we talk on the cell phone, and gossip and exchange film stories. Getting dishy or silly is an effective strategy to take the edge off The Van -- than in which locale it never gets more ''entre nous.''</p>
        <p>The most prized stories, of course, are the morbid: who threw up on camera, who got on the wrong plane and went to Thailand, who forgot to remove his or her body mike and repaired to the camper to make love with an unauthorized person (while the sound man, of course, put it out over the P.A.).</p>
        <p>This week my favorite is the couple who leased their house for a shoot. (''We'll leave it better than we found it'' -- a phrase, in itself, capable of raising a chuckle in the van. Other van howlers: ''It plays in one shot,''  ''I see one bare light bulb,''  ''Don't worry.'') One gag involved the couple's house catching fire. The technicians built a false front on the house and, on the day, set it aflame. The gag went awry and the whole house went up in flames. The owners, standing on a neighbor's lawn, looked at the marvelously believable effect and clapped. ''They clapped three times,'' the eyewitness said.</p>
        <p>Then one day we were shooting in a large Victorian house. The owner had grown up there. Her grandfather had built it, after the Civil War. ''Touch anything,'' she said, ''except the wallpaper.'' It was original to the house, flocked and multicolored, irreplaceable, historically significant and so on. And we were So Careful, until the last minute of the last day of night shooting, and the sun was coming up, and we had to get it and get out.</p>
        <p>''I need an eye-line,'' the star said. So someone took two long pieces of fluorescent tape and spread them in an X behind the camera, that is, on the wallpaper. When I punched out to go home, the camera crew was wrapping and our scene painter was on a ladder, a small Maglite in his teeth, three brushes in his hand, endeavoring to patch the ruined High Victorian Wallpaper. Well, we didn't leave it better than we found it, but we sure left it different.</p>
        <p>Q: What director of a cowboy movie found a great location in a Western state and then informed the studio that a 40-acre plain would have to have an underground irrigation system installed? (He wanted the location for a huge set-piece gun battle on horses.)</p>
        <p>''Why?'' they said, ''It's green now.''</p>
        <p>''But what,'' he said, ''if I have to do more than one take?''</p>
        <p>The studio, chastened, nodded and approved the expenditure -- not realizing that after the first take, the pasture would, of course, be mud, and ignorant, into the bargain, that the fortuitously found location belonged, that's right, to the director.</p>
        <p>Van dish: What suicide was not a suicide, what marriage not a marriage; who ''fixed'' the Oscars, who poisoned his wife, who was a bit too kind to animals; and updates on the various run-of-the-mill dope fiends, lushes, psychoneurotics and pedophiles who populate this business that we've chosen.</p>
        <p>One feels, and this is much of the joy, that it's always been the same -- the stories are the same, the names change: strike out the ones libel laws prohibit mentioning, fill in Ramon Navarro, Wallace Reid, Roscoe Arbuckle, Mary Miles Minter, William Desmond Taylor, Marilyn Monroe.</p>
        <p>Great story: from Jack Lemmon -- ''Some Like It Hot,'' first day, Billy Wilder comes to Jack and Tony Curtis and says, ''Boys, be good all the time, 'cause when the broad's good, we're gonna print it.''</p>
        <p>Another Billy Wilder story: Paramount comes to him, on ''Stalag 17.''</p>
        <p>''It's gonna be a big hit foreign,'' they say. ''We don't want to hurt the German market. How about if instead of being German, the camp guards were Poles? What do you think . . .?</p>
        <p>''I would,'' says Wilder, ''but most of my family died at Dachau.''</p>
        <p>Hollywood wisdom has it that one can't make a movie about Hollywood. Per contra, however, ''Sullivan's Travels,''  ''What Price Hollywood?'' (remade, of course, as ''A Star Is Born''), ''The Bad and the Beautiful,'' etc. -- in fact, one might apply the maxim IN TIME OF PEACE PREPARE FOR WAR, IN TIME OF WAR . . . and translate the Received Wisdom: ABOUT TIME FOR ANOTHER MOVIE ABOUT HOLLYWOOD.</p>
        <p>My attempt is the film ''State and Main.'' It was inspired by the Lone Pine Ridge story. This time around, a film company, three days away from principal photography, has lost its location. (A small town, out of which they were kicked when the movie's star was discovered in flagrante with a minor.)</p>
        <p>The film company descends on a new town and proceeds, in those three days, of course, to ''leave it better than they found it.''</p>
        <p>I am currently in preproduction for another film, and spending eons in the van in and around Montreal.</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' we say, ''you can shoot Montreal for anywhere. You can shoot it for Boston, you can go around a corner and shoot it for 18th-century Paris -- you can shoot it for New York. . . . ''</p>
        <p>And, at the end of the day, the van convulses itself with speculation about Location Scouting 300 years hence: ''Pluto,'' they would say. ''Man, I love Pluto -- you can shoot it for Jupiter, you can shoot it for the Moon, parts of it look like the Asteroids. . . . ''</p>
        <p>Van humor.</p>
