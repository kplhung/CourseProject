        <p>Bert Garskof, brother-in-law of Sen Joseph I Lieberman, urges supporters of Ralph Nader, whom he campaigned for in 1996, not to throw their votes away this year (S)</p>

        <p>The way Bert Garskof of Bethany, Conn., saw it during the 1996 presidential election, another Connecticut boy, Ralph Nader, was the best man for the job. So Mr. Garskof, a psychology professor at Quinnipiac University, working on the Internet, worked with Nader supporters in a dozen states.</p>
        <p>That was then. This is now -- and now Mr. Garskof has a problem. He is married to the sister of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman.</p>

        <p>The way Bert Garskof of Bethany, Conn., saw it during the 1996 presidential election, another Connecticut boy, Ralph Nader, was the best man for the job. So Mr. Garskof, a psychology professor at Quinnipiac University, working on the Internet, worked with Nader supporters in a dozen states.</p>
        <p>That was then. This is now -- and now Mr. Garskof has a problem. He is married to the sister of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>Polls indicate that while Mr. Nader, now as in 1996, has no chance of becoming president, he has enough support to steal some votes from Al Gore in some states, no small thing in a close election. Or as Mr. Garskof put it the other day, something he helped start now has ''a potential to hurt something I believe in.''</p>
        <p>What to do?</p>
        <p>He has begun warning Nader supporters not to ''throw away'' their vote on a ''dream,'' arguing that Mr. Nader, for all the good things he supports, like a cleaner environment,  cannot win. Go with someone who can win, he says, go with Al Gore and brother-in-law Lieberman, a team that once it wins will have the power to genuinely do something for the environment.</p>
