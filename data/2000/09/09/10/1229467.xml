        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani acknowledged yesterday that a woman had been treated at an emergency room on Monday after she complained of being sprayed with a pesticide used to kill mosquitoes that spread the West Nile virus. But the mayor said there was ''obviously a discrepancy'' between the city's spraying schedule and the woman's account of when she was sprayed.</p>
        <p>The woman, whose account was published yesterday in The Daily News, was quoted as saying she was drenched with the pesticide at 10:45 p.m. last Sunday as she stood on West 58th Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The Daily News article said the woman, an artist whom the newspaper did not identify, had been sprayed at point-blank range by a passing city truck. As a result, it said, she experienced severe nausea and eye problems and feared more serious long-term effects because she has a form of asthma that reacts to chemicals.</p>
        <p>At a news conference yesterday, the mayor was joined by Health Department officials, who said they were investigating the incident.</p>
        <p>But the officials said the woman's version conflicted with city records, which show that spraying in the area where the incident is said to have occurred did not begin until shortly before midnight last Sunday, at least an hour after the woman said she was sprayed.</p>
        <p>But the mayor also said incidents like the one described in The Daily News might be unavoidable because of the amount of spraying that is taking place.</p>
