        <p>On Thursday and Friday nights, Luna Park is like a Broadway theater just before show time. Limousines and taxis pull up out front, disgorging happy, pretty people dressed in black. The wait for a table is an hour; the crowd is five-deep at the bar, and people huddle outside the door as if they were waiting for scalpers to sell them seats.</p>
        <p>Luna Park, at 694 Valencia Street, is a bar and bistro. But although it opened only in June, this latest addition to the trendy bar-restaurant area of the Mission district has already established a reputation as a happening scene. It manages to attract all kinds: the artsy crowd, dot-com new money, post-preppie Brooks Brothers aficionados and real grown-ups.</p>

        <p>On Thursday and Friday nights, Luna Park is like a Broadway theater just before show time. Limousines and taxis pull up out front, disgorging happy, pretty people dressed in black.

        <p>Luna Park, at 694 Valencia Street, is a bar and bistro. But although it opened only in June, this latest addition to the trendy bar-restaurant area of the Mission district has already established a reputation as a happening scene. It manages to attract all kinds: the artsy crowd, dot-com new money, post-preppie Brooks Brothers aficionados and real grown-ups.</p>
        <p>Named after the famous old Coney Island amusement park (and for all the European amusement parks that came after it and still use the name), Luna Park looks less like funky San Francisco than like SoHo. Under the two-story ceiling, the decor is postindustrial chic: walls painted brick-red, acid-stained concrete floors, booths fashioned from church pews and a bar made from salvaged redwood.</p>
        <p>On weeknights, there is a neighborhood crowd. Friends getting together. Weekends, the place becomes a throwback to a time when bars were the place to go to Meet Someone. The groups of men and women who come in together hoping to be singled out are reminiscent of the last days of disco.</p>
        <p>Luna Park's dinner menu lists salads and other light California fare, but the bar sees some serious mixed-drinkers. If you're not ordering a mojito ($7), the Cuban mint julep rum drink, than you're probably having a margarita ($6.50). Beer? Of course you can drink it, but you'll be branded as hopelessly East Coast.</p>
