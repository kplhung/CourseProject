        <p>While video game enthusiasts may be pulling all-nighters battling three-dimensional demons in the new Diablo II, more nostalgic game players are rediscovering a simpler bygone joystick: Atari. To play Pac-Man, Missile Command and other games left for extinct in the 80's, some are digging ancient Atari systems out of their closets, others are buying them on eBay (about $30). While classic cartridges like Asteroids, Combat and Space Invaders can still be bought for a couple of dollars at many electronics stores, rarer Atari games like Quadran, from 1983, can fetch up to $400 on online auctions.</p>
        <p>''It's a big thing of my youth,'' said John Hardie, 34, an Atari collector in Valley Stream, N.Y. ''It's hard to explain. It's what I grew up with.''</p>

        <p>While video game enthusiasts may be pulling all-nighters battling three-dimensional demons in the new Diablo II, more nostalgic game players are rediscovering a simpler bygone joystick: Atari.

        <p>''It's a big thing of my youth,'' said John Hardie, 34, an Atari collector in Valley Stream, N.Y. ''It's hard to explain. It's what I grew up with.''</p>
        <p>The unofficial totem of the refound faith is a T-shirt bearing the Atari logo, a sort of streamlined, inverted fleur-de-lis. It is still manufactured and can be found at Urban Outfitters ($28). The ''triple track'' version (right), with a white collar and stripes around the arms, has been especially visible since DJ Qualls wore it in the film ''Road Trip'' this year.</p>
        <p>Vintage shirts and unopened cartridges can be ordered from O'Shea Ltd., a video game retailer in Kansas City, Mo.: www.atariclassic.com.</p>
