        <p>We asked readers of Matthew Miller's article on Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico for their reactions to his position on drugs. Here are some responses from , a New York Times online knowledge network.</p>
        <p>I agree with Governor Johnson's stand for the legalization of marijuana. I personally do not use it, but I have tried it in the past. As far as I'm concerned, the biggest crime it causes is a need for snacks and for long periods of sleep.</p>

        <p>Johnson is right. Marijuana is less addictive than cigarettes and less harmful than alcohol. Let's spend the money on educating our kids and helping the undisciplined to become disciplined.</p>
        <p>(rrs)</p>
        <p>Johnson is, for the most part, right on. Marijuana, heroin, cocaine, etc. should not be ''legalized,'' that is, available for commercial exploitation. But their ''social'' use should be decriminalized. And the victims-abusers should have access to treatment, as with alcohol.</p>

        <p>Why won't other politicians listen? Are they too addicted to the status quo?</p>
        <p>(rcvandy)</p>
        <p>I once did a paper on the criminalization of drugs by the Harrison Act of 1914. Before that, drug use was a medical matter between you and your physician. People seem to forget that organized crime really took off in this country during Prohibition.</p>

        <p>Reassess our position on drugs? It's time to give the Boston Tea Party a whole new meaning.</p>
