        <p>Exide Corporation, the world's largest maker of automobile and industrial batteries, will begin within a month moving its corporate headquarters to Princeton from Reading, Pa., said Michael S. Geylin, corporate spokesman. The company, which sells batteries through such outlets as Kmart, Pep Boys and the National Automotive Parts Association, is in the process of restructuring and relocating personnel. About 50 of the 325 people who work in the Reading offices will be moved to Princeton, which was selected because of its proximity to New York City and the financial markets. Others will be relocated to offices in Chicago and Atlanta, while an undetermined number will be laid off, Mr. Geylin said. The company is currently negotiating for space in Princeton. The move is to be phased in over several months.</p>
