        <p>Millions of Americans who play slot machines understand that if you keep  playing you will eventually lose. The machines are programmed that way.  In a case decided in United States Tax Court, the I.R.S. stipulated that William T. Praytor of Fairhope, Ala., was  in the ''trade or profession'' of slot machine gambler even though the tax returns that Mr. Praytor and his wife filed bore out the inexorable mathematics of one-armed bandits: Mr. Praytor had won $318,750 from 1994 through 1996 and lost $392,763. But when he tried to deduct his $74,000 in losses plus $23,000 in interest on gambling markers, he lost again. Judge Lewis R. Carluzzo ruled that professional gamblers can deduct losses and gambling expenses only until their winnings reach zero. He ordered the Praytors to pay $25,000.</p>
