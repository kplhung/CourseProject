        <p>EVERY culture cherishes the myths and rituals by which it marks the change of seasons, and associates different times of the year with appropriate modes of expression. According to the literary critic Northrop Frye, each of the four seasons of the Northern Hemisphere has given rise to a correlative genre: satire belongs to winter, comedy to spring, romance to summer and tragedy to fall. Our present civilization has little appetite for tragedy, but a wispy shadow of Frye's theory persists, as the coming of autumn sends children back to school and putatively serious movies back into the multiplexes. As the days grow shorter, the running times grow longer. Special effects give way to feats of costume and set design. The box office sprints of the Memorial and Independence Day weekends, and the damaged-goods studio yard sales of late August, are soon forgotten as the long march toward Christmas -- and the Oscars -- begins. Hollywood, after a three-month revel in expensive triviality, knits its brow and dons its glasses to signal a renewed commitment to expensive importance.</p>
        <p>This, at any rate, is the myth, though a recent article in Variety -- with the enchanting headline ''Fall Films Favor Frothy Fare'' -- suggests that its power and relevance may be diminishing. The film industry's autumnal hopes seem to be pinned, for the moment, on a live-action adaptation, ''Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' and an updating of the 70's television show ''Charlie's Angels,'' which not even those of us who decorated our bedrooms with pictures of its crime-fighting stars ever considered a work of art. And there are further signs that cinematic seriousness has fallen on hard times. In another article in the same issue, Variety reported that ''art films'' -- art in the quantitative sense, meaning movies shown on 600 or fewer screens nationwide -- had suffered a 14 percent decline in box office revenues so far this year, as compared with 1999 and 1998. And among critics, the nervous high spirits of 1999 -- a year that seemed to herald a revival of risky, innovative American filmmaking (tribute to which was paid by the Academy's embrace of the tame, derivative ''American Beauty'') -- have dissipated, leaving an air of gloom and resignation.</p>

        <p>EVERY culture cherishes the myths and rituals by which it marks the change of seasons, and associates different times of the year with appropriate modes of expression. According to the literary critic Northrop Frye, each of the four seasons of the Northern Hemisphere has given rise to a correlative genre: satire belongs to winter, comedy to spring, romance to summer and tragedy to fall. Our present civilization has little appetite for tragedy, but a wispy shadow of Frye's theory persists, as the coming of autumn sends children back to school and putatively serious movies back into the multiplexes. As the days grow shorter, the running times grow longer. Special effects give way to feats of costume and set design. The box office sprints of the Memorial and Independence Day weekends, and the damaged-goods studio yard sales of late August, are soon forgotten as the long march toward Christmas -- and the Oscars -- begins. Hollywood, after a three-month revel in expensive triviality, knits its brow and dons its glasses to signal a renewed commitment to expensive importance.</p>
        <p>This, at any rate, is the myth, though a recent article in Variety -- with the enchanting headline ''Fall Films Favor Frothy Fare'' -- suggests that its power and relevance may be diminishing. The film industry's autumnal hopes seem to be pinned, for the moment, on a live-action adaptation, ''Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' and an updating of the 70's television show ''Charlie's Angels,'' which not even those of us who decorated our bedrooms with pictures of its crime-fighting stars ever considered a work of art. And there are further signs that cinematic seriousness has fallen on hard times. In another article in the same issue, Variety reported that ''art films'' -- art in the quantitative sense, meaning movies shown on 600 or fewer screens nationwide -- had suffered a 14 percent decline in box office revenues so far this year, as compared with 1999 and 1998. And among critics, the nervous high spirits of 1999 -- a year that seemed to herald a revival of risky, innovative American filmmaking (tribute to which was paid by the Academy's embrace of the tame, derivative ''American Beauty'') -- have dissipated, leaving an air of gloom and resignation.</p>
        <p>Whether this pessimism reflects a momentary and recurrent mood swing -- for most of its history, at least since the coming of the talkies, the cinema has been reported by somebody or other to be in decline -- or a true intimation of mortality remains to be seen. In any case, the love of an art form that is the critic's first obligation often expresses itself as a protective grumpiness about the art's current prospects. But it does seem worthwhile to ask, in the spirit of love as well as duty, what we mean by calling some movies serious, and how we go about taking them seriously.</p>
        <p>These questions are more complicated than they sound, and any attempt to address them risks tripping the buried land mines of past debates -- between Sarrisites and Kaelites, between humanists and formalists, between worshipers at the shrine of difficulty and pagan celebrants in the cult of pop. The past century has witnessed a series of attempts to draw, to blur and to erase altogether the boundaries that separate high culture from low. And the movies, which have done more than any other medium to upend such lazy and invidious distinctions, have nonetheless been irresistible to those who rely on them. A reflexive snobbery based on uncritical valuation of the foreign, the arty, the ''independent'' often confronts an equally automatic sham-populist deference to mass taste.</p>
        <p>But the truth -- a truth every moviegoer and honest critic instinctively knows -- is that you can't judge experience according to prefabricated categories. There are plenty of dull, meretricious films dressed up (or down, given the current art house bias in favor of the hand-held and the rough-hewn) in the trappings of art, and just as many gaudy commercial toys that turn out to be vehicles of aesthetic transcendence.</p>
        <p>Another myth that seems especially dear these days to critics of literature and pop music as well as movies is the myth of the lost heroic age, in whose shadow the sickly, pale inhabitants of the present are doomed to labor. The memory of two such ages haunts critics, audiences and filmmakers alike: the nearer one is the golden, squandered moment of the New Hollywood, which unfolded in the decade between ''Bonnie and Clyde'' and ''Star Wars'' -- the era of ''Nashville'' and the ''Godfather'' movies, of ''Mean Streets'' and ''Chinatown'' and Pauline Kael. This moment, sometimes called the era of American auteurism, saw the late flowering of seeds planted in the first golden age, a decade or so earlier, which witnessed, among other developments, the adaptation of the auteur theory to an American context, the founding of the New York Film Festival, the canonization of classic Hollywood, and the cresting of the French New Wave.</p>
        <p>In the late 50's and early 60's, through the efforts of a dedicated cadre of critics, editors, repertory programmers and besotted cinephiles (or film buffs, if you prefer), a lively and serious film culture began to emerge in the larger American cities, filtering out onto college campuses and suburban film clubs. The institutional and intellectual achievement of this culture was substantial: its adherents led the way in efforts to preserve the movies of the past, recognized the embattled craftsmen of the old Hollywood as important artists, and made elevated critical discussion of movies seem both urgent and chic. ''We looked to filmmakers to be our novelists, our sages,'' Philip Lopate has written in ''Anticipation of La Notte,'' his wry, clearsighted essay on his own youthful movie mania. ''Film enjoyed as never before (or since) the prestige of high culture.''</p>
        <p>True enough. Mr. Lopate's reminiscence, happily, is concerned less with prestige than with pleasure, and the critical essays collected in his engaging 1998 book ''Totally, Tenderly, Tragically'' are, like any criticism worth reading, evidence that seriousness is an ennobled form of delight. Is it also an endangered one? Movies are bigger than ever. Have our ways of talking about them gotten small? Each year more of them flicker across our screens -- and there is, suddenly, a glut of screens, with new megaplexes sprouting from Times Square to Tulsa -- or illuminate our living rooms. But the film culture whose heroic age Mr. Lopate celebrates survives in fragments. The ''film generation,'' the transformative impact of whose arrival the critic Stanley Kauffman hailed nearly 40 years ago, has been succeeded, with breathtaking and brutal speed, by generations reared on rock, on television and now online.</p>
        <p>THE relations between these generations -- the tangle of envy, impatience, admiration and bewilderment that informs their regard for each other -- is a central and underacknowledged fact of our culture and our politics. To those filmgoers born too late to see ''L'Avventura'' in its initial run, or who never set foot in the Thalia or the old second-run theaters of Times Square, who first saw ''The Godfather'' on video and ''Breathless'' on cable -- to most of the movie audience, in other words -- the endless hymning of the glories of the past can seem like a dropped gauntlet we hesitate to pick up. How can the delights of different ages be compared? Isn't my formative enchantment with Molly Ringwald the equal of your undergraduate lust for Julie Christie or Anouk Aimee? Is my ''Dazed and Confused'' worth less than your ''Dolce Vita''? Isn't it all just a matter of taste?</p>
        <p>Well, yes, but there's more to taste than knowing what you like, and if lived experiences are incommensurable with one another, works of art nonetheless demand to be ranked, judged and argued about -- that's part of the fun. It's also, I'm tempted to say, a fact of human nature. Arguments about whether the movies are on the verge of death or the cusp of a new golden age -- thanks to digital video, computer-generated imagery, the internet, Dogma 95, globalization or Adam Sandler -- are likely to continue. A new golden age -- the indie moment, the Chinese new wave, the discovery of Iran -- may be just behind us, or just ahead.</p>
        <p>But the more important arguments, the ones that will determine the future of this protean and impatient (and still young) art form, will be about particular movies. And here, perhaps, there is cause for some concern. The rise first of the video store and then of the Internet has made movies and the discussion of them more accessible than ever before. These technologies have also contributed to the fragmentation of audiences, and the triumph of niche marketing and complacent subjectivism. The film industry, with serious money on the line, helps to trivialize its product, drowning conversation in bullying hype. Movies, whose expense demands that they remain a mass medium, get bigger and smaller at the same time -- either gaudy baubles or tiny diamonds in the rough. Some you can't see: a trip to the new 12-screen movie palace ends in the discovery that half of the screens are devoted to half-hourly showings of the same blockbuster.</p>
        <p>In the golden year of 1999, already receding into myth, several brilliantly unlikely American movies -- ''Being John Malkovich,'' ''Boys Don't Cry'' -- broke through to audiences. But a number of others -- ''Election,'' ''Three Kings'' and ''Go'' -- foundered in spite of the ardor of critics. Others arrive disfigured by the sham-democracy of test-marketing and the bureacratic authoritarianism of top-down scriptwriting by committee. This year has so far seen the release of a number of interesting movies -- ''Jesus' Son,'' ''Chuck and Buck,'' ''American Psycho'' and at least a half-dozen more -- that seemed to require, and to languish in the absence of, the protective embrace and the critical scrutiny of a devoted audience. The makers of the three films just mentioned -- Alison Maclean, Miguel Arteta and Mary Harron -- have each now made two commercial features that show them to be stylistically daring and intellectually curious. They and other emerging voices, including those who have been graced with the success to allow them their choice of projects, are in need of defenders and debunkers. The serious movies are out there, in search of a culture.</p>
