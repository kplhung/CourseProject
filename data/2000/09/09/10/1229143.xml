        <p>GEOFFREY BEENE  Fashion designer</p>
        <p>PILOBOLUS is one of my favorite companies. They are very inventive. That's where I met Martha Clarke, one of my favorite choreographers of all time. She's now working on a Hans Christian Andersen show. I can't wait to see that. I first saw her ''Vienna: Lusthaus'' and was so dazzled I went back three or four times. She introduced herself and we've been friends ever since. Her imagination is beyond anyone's I've seen.</p>

She's now working on a Hans Christian Andersen show. I can't wait to see that. I first saw her ''Vienna: Lusthaus'' and was so dazzled I went back three or four times.

        <p>RICHARD MOVE  Martha Graham interpreter</p>
        <p>I'M looking forward to the opening of the Mark Morris building in Brooklyn -- the Mark Morris pavilion -- and especially looking forward to his idea of doing variety shows there that incorporate a variety of types of performers from the community -- like vaudeville style. His whole set-up is similar to what the big choreographers have in Europe. It's so inspiring and great for him and the company: rehearsal space the size of an opera house, stages with wings. It's a glimmer of hope in difficult times.</p>
        <p>Other things I'm looking forward to: the Cunningham Event season at the Joyce and -- in a voyeuristic kind of way -- to see how the epic Greek drama of the whole Graham company and school works itself out.</p>
        <p>I'm very much looking forward to ''Les Mizrahi'' -- to toot my own horn a little bit. [Mr. Move directed Isaac Mizrahi in the one-man show.] We did a workshop of it in June at the Drama Department in the Village. We're going forward with the production to open this fall: a fabulous one-man show where Mizrahi sings, does monologues about his career, his life and the crazy world of fashion and his empire. It's funny, poignant and exciting. A tour de force. He does beautiful fashion renderings and sews on stage.</p>
        <p>And looking forward with sweet terror -- as Martha would say -- to my own Martha productions this fall and winter in new spaces: Town Hall and an intimate salon evening at the Russian Samovar, Baryshnikov's restaurant -- it used to be Sinatra's restaurant Jilly's. It's so old New York.</p>
        <p>I am so looking forward to Stephen Daldry's movie ''Billy Elliot'' about the young boy in the north of England who wants to become a dancer. It won a director's award at Cannes. Our own film ''Martha's World'' will be shown on Saturday and Sept. 22 as part of the Independent Feature Film Market at the Angelika. We're going to show it as a work-in-progress at the festival in September. How could I forget that?</p>
        <p>IRENE DIAMOND  Philanthropist</p>
        <p>I'M very interested in my biggest commitment with the New York City Ballet, the best company in the world today. Their corps de ballet is superb. Peter Martins and I are starting a new choreographic institute -- my real interest is finding talented choreographers from around the world. We have great hopes for it. I am also involved with Eliot Feld's company. I think he's a very gifted choreographer and has a wonderful company. And with Dance Theater of Harlem, Arthur Mitchell's company, and Lar Lubovitch. I think there are going to be some very interesting -- and different -- things from all of them.</p>
        <p>DOUG VARONE  Choreographer</p>
        <p>I'M really excited to see Anne Bogart's ''War of the Worlds'' at BAM. I think she is really tremendous and I love her mix of movement and theater. I'm glad I'm going to be in town for Merce Cunningham's ''Events'' at the Joyce in November and for John Jasperse's company in the Altogether Different series at the Joyce in January. There's a fascinating version of ''La Boheme'' coming to New York City Opera by a director named Jim Robinson, whom I have worked with in the past. He did it at Glimmerglass this summer and it comes to New York this fall. I'll also be at the Bang on a Can Marathon at BAM in December, in part because I have worked with the composers Julia Wolfe and Michael Gordon. I can't wait to sit for eight hours and listen to new music. It sends my imagination going in lots of different directions.</p>
        <p>HOPE BOYKIN  Member of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater</p>
        <p>I WAS a member of Complexions in 1994 when it started. I had done a studio performance at Ailey -- a solo Matthew Rushing choreographed for me. Afterward, Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson approached me and asked if I was interested in a project they were starting -- Complexions. I was one of the few nonprofessional dancers. I was dancing with people I had looked up to, like Sarita Allen, Steven Smith, Christina Johnson, Rebecca Rigert, Sheri Williams, Nathaniel Trice and Andre Tyson. For me to be able to be part of the company meant a lot. What I'm looking forward to is Dwight's New York premiere of ''Love Stories,'' which he started choreographing as part of the Carlisle Project, in which modern-dance choreographers work with ballet vocabulary. It's tentatively scheduled for the end of October at John Jay College.</p>
        <p>THEODORE BARTWINK  Executive director of the Harkness Foundation for Dance</p>
        <p>THIS fall I'll be spending quite a few evenings at the Joyce Theater. Garth Fagan Dance, a company with astounding technical skill and high energy, will be there in November with a world premiere by Fagan and his ''Griot New York'' collaborator, Wynton Marsalis. Later on in the month, Michael Moschen will be there for a two-week run. It's intriguing how he unites juggling with dance. In December, I'll be back to see Ballet Hispanico, another favorite of mine, and then in January I'm planning to return for the New York debut of Diavolo Dance Theater, a Los Angeles-based company known for its visually startling work performed on enormous tilting platforms. As you can see, as a trustee of the Joyce Theater I am somewhat partial to their programming. Having said that, I always look forward to the diversity of dance in New York City. The 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Project will be performing at the Duke on 42nd Street featuring Ben Munisteri and his modern dancers, the Vertigo Dance Company from Israel, Yoshiko Chuma and School of Hard Knocks and Amy Sue Rosen/Derek Bernstein Projects.</p>
        <p>ROBERT TRACY  Author of ''Spaces of the Mind,'' a new book about Isamu Noguchi</p>
        <p>ANYTHING that Vladimir Malakhov does. He recently did his own production of ''La Bayadere'' for the Vienna State Opera Ballet, and I would love to see that brought to New York. Based on the success of ''Bayadere,'' Vienna has asked him to do another creation -- which he will choreograph, star in and oversee -- a production of Verdi's ''Ballo in Maschera,'' which will have its premiere in Austria on March 11. Malakhov will be coming to New York in October for American Ballet Theater's season and will be performing in Twyla Tharp's piece, in Graham's ''Diversion of Angels'' and in Balanchine's ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux.'' Also at A.B.T., Christian Holder is doing a piece called ''Weren't We Fools'' that features Susan Jaffe and Ethan Stiefel. He says he choreographed it ''from a woman's point of view.''</p>
        <p>Carmen de Lavallade is making a duet for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater's Renee Robinson and Glenn Sims. It's called ''Sweet Bitter Love'' and is the first piece she has made for the company. It will have its premiere at City Center during the company's December season.</p>
        <p>Tony Powell is doing a piece for the Joffrey Ballet called ''Lyric Discourse.'' He is making both the music and the choreography, which I think is outstanding. Since Alwin Nikolais very few choreographers have done their own music. Apparently David Parsons, his friend, introduced him to the Joffrey Ballet. Tony's piece will have its premiere at the Auditorium Theater in Chicago on Oct. 19. Ron K. Brown's ''High Life'' -- set to West African music -- will be at BAM in February, at the Harvey. The Brooklyn Academy of Music commissioned and produced the season, which is very important. It shows that his career was jump-started by his commission ''Grace,'' last year by Ailey, which will perform it again this season at City Center.</p>
        <p>LIZZIE SIMON  Creative producer at the Flea Theater, 1998-2000</p>
        <p>I FEEL Terry Dean Bartlett and Lisa LeAnn Dalton really have their finger on the pulse: they know young choreographers who are doing incredibly contemporary, personal, vibrant work. Together they present a monthly showcase called ''Lisa LeAnn and Terry Dean Put On a Dance Show'' at Galapagos in Brooklyn. I love the format: six or seven short works: a whole palette of aesthetics. They both dance for Elizabeth Streb, so there's always a very physical, acrobatic, even dangerous element. It's exciting to be in the room. I hadn't had that feeling about dance for a while.</p>
        <p>Big Dance Theater is doing a revival run of ''Another Telepathic Thing'' at the Performing Garage from mid-November through December. It's deeply brilliant. They won two Obies this year, but because there are so few venues, the award-winning shows don't get remounted. But Big Dance Theater found a way to do it again. It's a work that tons of people need to see: they took transcripts of Hollywood audition interviews and a Mark Twain story and mixed them together. It's a great, timely subject for downtown exploration. And they're just an amazing company.</p>
        <p>Nami Yamamoto is going to be at Dance Theater Workshop this fall doing a show called ''Wan Dollah.'' It's about Asian stereotypes. I have seen her perform in different ensembles and she is really fierce, a force of nature.</p>
