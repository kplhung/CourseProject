        <p>Had it not been for Mark Messier's presence here today, the biggest story as the Rangers opened training camp might have been the rookie defenseman Dale Purinton's two fights with an overmatched antagonist named Marty Melnychuk, one on the ice and one in the trainer's room later.</p>
        <p>Or it might have been the speech Glen Sather, the team's new president and general manager, gave the players on Friday night.</p>
        <p>It might have been Coach Ron Low's first day at the helm, or defenseman Stephane Quintal's return from the exile imposed on him for criticizing the franchise at the end of last season.</p>
        <p>The prolonged holdout by the rookie defenseman Mike Mottau would have merited serious consideration. And defenseman Rich Pilon's weight, 212 pounds, was significant, too. Sather had told him to report at or under 215 pounds, or not to report at all.</p>
        <p>And then, of course, there was the saga of goaltender Mike Richter and his improving left knee, which will most likely keep him out until mid-October.</p>
        <p>Any of the above could have been the story of the day. But, for the first time in three seasons, Messier was back on the ice wearing a Rangers  uniform. And no development here today was bigger than that.</p>
        <p>Brian Leetch, who surrendered the team captaincy to Messier the moment he re-signed with the team, pronounced that it was as if Messier had never left.</p>
        <p>''In a way,'' Messier agreed.</p>
        <p>The Rangers' three playoff-less seasons without Messier were among the longest in franchise history.</p>
        <p>''I'm not coming back with the idea that things are going to be the same,'' Messier said. ''Obviously, things will be different. But I think they will be different in a good way.''</p>
        <p>One of the main differences will be on the ice. Other than Theo Fleury (in the Canada Cup), Leetch, Richter and Adam Graves, Messier has not played with any of the current Rangers. Today Messier skated on a line with Fleury and Graves.</p>
        <p>But, unlike last season, when Fleury often stood out because of his poor play, he just blended into the supporting cast today.</p>
        <p>''I like it like that,'' said Fleury, who scored 15 goals and 64 points last season.</p>
        <p>Valery Kamensky, another of last season's bigger busts, must have liked blending in as well.</p>
        <p>There were plenty of other subplots, too.</p>
        <p>For Manny Malhotra -- who last season was caught in a power struggle between Neil Smith, then the general manager, and John Muckler, then the coach -- today was ''like a fresh start,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Last year has been erased from my mind,'' he said. ''I'm really looking forward to this camp and this year.''</p>
        <p>And, of course, there was Pavel Brendl, the main story of the first day of camp last season, a day he would like to forget. A first-round draft choice, Brendl had already been penciled into the opening night lineup, sight unseen. But he reported to camp horribly out of shape, and by the end of the first day of camp, he had penciled his name right out.</p>
        <p>Today Brendl, who was a member of Messier's intrasquad team, was almost the forgotten man.</p>
        <p>''For me, it's better that way,'' said Brendl, who looked bulked up at 207 pounds. ''I can concentrate on my practices. I'm in way better shape. And hopefully I'm going to enjoy this training camp more than I did last year.''</p>
        <p>With Messier around to deflect the attention this season, he, and most of the other Rangers, probably will.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>DON MALONEY, the Rangers' assistant general manager, who is handling the team's negotiations with defenseman MIKE MOTTAU, who is holding out, said, ''It really comes down to how much guaranteed money he's going to get.'' Mottau's agent, BOB MURRAY, did not disagree. The Rangers are offering Mottau, who won the Hobey Baker award last season as college hockey's top player, a signing bonus of $500,000 -- commensurate with the signing bonuses of two former Hobey winners, CHRIS DRURY and BRENDAN MORRISON. Murray is seeking a bonus in the range of $700,000, what JEFF FARKAS, Mottau's roommate at Boston College last season, signed for without ever winning the Hobey. President and General Manager GLEN SATHER and Coach RON LOW would like Mottau to come to training camp, regardless. But Murray vowed Mottau would not until an agreement is reached. ''He's not going to come in without a contract,'' Murray said. ''That doesn't accomplish anything.''</p>
