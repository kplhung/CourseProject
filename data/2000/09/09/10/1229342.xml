        <p>Don't be alarmed if you can't find listings for Bukharan or Uzbek cuisine in Zagat's. Make your way to 74 West 47th Street, near the Avenue of the Americas, pass the hustler from the diamond shop on the ground floor, up the black stairway to the third floor, and you can find what you are looking for at Gan-Eden.</p>
        <p>In Hebrew, the name can mean the Garden of Eden, heaven or paradise. This restaurant has been serving the classic cuisine of Bukharan Jews for the last five years. The Bukharans are from  Uzbekistan and neighboring countries in  Central Asia. Some scholars say they are descendants of the lost tribes of Israel.</p>

        <p>Don't be alarmed if you can't find listings for Bukharan or Uzbek cuisine in Zagat's. Make your way to 74 West 47th Street, near the Avenue of the Americas, pass the hustler from the diamond shop on the ground floor, up the black stairway to the third floor, and you can find what you are looking for at Gan-Eden.</p>
        <p>In Hebrew, the name can mean the Garden of Eden, heaven or paradise. This restaurant has been serving the classic cuisine of Bukharan Jews for the last five years. The Bukharans are from  Uzbekistan and neighboring countries in  Central Asia. Some scholars say they are descendants of the lost tribes of Israel.</p>
        <p>You will probably find the owner, Shalom Isakov, a native of Fergana, Uzbekistan, chatting with regulars at the restaurant, which he bought seven months ago. At lunch hour, the eight tables are filled with an odd-looking mix of diamond district shop owners and workers as well as lawyers and bankers. You can hear Hebrew, Russian, Farsi, Uzbek and the Bukharans' dialect of Tajik, which is closely related to Farsi.</p>
        <p>Business is split evenly between these customers and deliveries. ''Shalom cooks and I run the place on the phone,'' said Ilya Borukhov, Mr. Isakov's brother-in-law and the store's manager, clutching the incessantly ringing cordless phone.</p>
        <p>''There are lots of Bukharan Jews that work in the area, even right here downstairs,'' Mr. Borukhov said.</p>
        <p>The menu includes plov, a dish made of rice, carrots and meat; samsa, a meat pie; and lagman, a noodle soup from Uzbekistan. The most popular items are kabobs served with either rice or French fries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Isakov, 37, arrived in this country about six years ago and started as an assistant cook, mostly peeling potatoes, at several restaurants.</p>
        <p>''He can cook anything,'' Mr. Borukhov said. ''Italian, Chinese, I don't know what.''</p>
