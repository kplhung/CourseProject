        <p>THE MURDERED HOUSE</p>
        <p>By Pierre Magnan.</p>
        <p>Harvill, $26.</p>
        <p>Not far into Pierre Magnan's Gothic revenge novel set in 1920's Provence, the protagonist, a quiet, hulking man named Seraphin Monge, sets about to tear down, stone by stone, his family's inn, La Burliere. The country inn was the scene of the slaughter of Seraphin's family some two decades before; only the infant Seraphin managed to survive. The three men accused of the murders were guillotined, but when Seraphin, recently returned from the war, begins to demolish the house he realizes that the true culprits escaped punishment -- which he decides to mete out himself. Soon his mother begins to invade his dreams, urging him to avenge her death. She appears as a voluptuous temptress in a series of Oedipal nightmares that produce in Seraphin paroxysms of guilt, making intimacy with the women who chase after him a near impossibility. Magnan's plot is inventive and his narrative is energetic, but these qualities are often overshadowed by a lack of subtlety (the ''big, twisted key, obviously very worn'' that unlocks La Burliere's front door is meant to signify the unlocking of closed doors in Seraphin's past). But in Patricia Clancy's agile translation, Magnan's evocation of the earthy French villagers is gripping, as is the novel's sinister atmosphere; ''The Murdered House'' banishes the cliches of gentle, sunny Provence.</p>
