        <p>THE term ''contextual'' having become debased by those who fundamentally despise the whole idea of architecture, the time has come to speak of ''relational'' design -- buildings that interact with their surroundings in full dimension instead of dumbly mimicking the scale and form of their next-door neighbors.

        <p>THE term ''contextual'' having become debased by those who fundamentally despise the whole idea of architecture, the time has come to speak of ''relational'' design -- buildings that interact with their surroundings in full dimension instead of dumbly mimicking the scale and form of their next-door neighbors. We should think of architecture as a supremely interactive art -- a participatory medium that transforms configurations of scale, dimension, shape, proximity, space, time, energy, cultural meaning, economic value and land use.</p>
        <p>In the coming months, there will be many opportunities to enrich the vocabulary for talking about architecture in relational terms. Perhaps the most spirited of these projects is the continuing development of SPARCity -- Eric Owen Moss's name for the discontinuous loop of urban development he has been designing for Culver City, Calif.. (The project is named for the air rights over the former tracks of a Southern Pacific freight line).</p>
        <p>Since the mid-1980's, Moss, supported by two enlightened clients, Frederick and Laurie Smith, has been converting abandoned factory buildings for use by firms specializing in graphic design, advertising, film production and other post-industrial businesses. This month, SPARCity reaches critical mass with the completion of the Stealth Building, as it has become known, the ground-hugging centerpiece of a newly redeveloped Culver City block. The building vaguely recalls the bomber's tapered horizontal profile.This is the authentic New Urbanism -- the productive future of the tattered industrial center.</p>
        <p>The Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., is the first project in the Northeast by Antoine Predock, the architectural shaman of the American Southwest.  Designed to foster crossdisciplinary experiments in the arts, the Tang is finished in stone, metal and concrete, and is surrounded by a circle of white pines. Two giant staircases converge to form a symbolic crossroads of culture and nature. Not since the glory days of the Beaux Arts have we seen such an extravagant representation of the ascent to Parnassus.</p>
        <p>Since no relationship matters more than the unstable links between older urban centers and the suburbs encircling them, the most important event this season will be the presidential campaign. Between now and November, we will find out whether either candidate has anything substantial to say on urban policy. The past eight years have seen declining crime rates and increased participation from the private sector in urban life.  But the Clinton administration wasted the opportunity to invest in housing, transportation and public space, or to revitalize the urban core as an economic engine.</p>
        <p>Nowhere have the shortcomings of urban policy been clearer than in Baltimore, a city that has been at the forefront of innovation for three decades. Despite urban homesteading, the Harborside festival marketplace, the Camden Yards ball park and other initiatives undertaken by the public and private spheres, Baltimore continues to epitomize the city as a permanent invalid of modern life. The Student Arts Center, designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien for Johns Hopkins University, adds a new layer to the city's cultural mix. Intended to bring art into an environment dedicated to science, the three-winged building creates a new campus landscape with courtyards, paths, and views.</p>
        <p>Things are really cooking this year for Zaha Hadid. Her most ambitious built work to date will open in December. A tramway station and car park in the French city of Strasbourg, the project is an infrastructural intervention designed to reduce car traffic in the central district. Like Peter Eisenman's design for the Staten Island ferry terminal, Hadid's forms are derived from the motion patterns of different transportation modes. And what, by the way, is the status of Eisenman's fine plan?</p>
        <p>Not one of these forthcoming projects is ''appropriate.'' Isn't that great? Like ''contextual,'' the word ''appropriate'' has ceased to be constructive. Buildings can be good, bad, mediocre or pointless. But ''appropriateness'' is a useless gauge of architectural value. Rather, it has become equivalent to the notion of progress in the postwar decades. It represents the evasion of responsibility for personal preference. ''Don't hold me accountable. History made me do it. Peer pressure made me do it.'' Mediocrity loves company.</p>
        <p>Our understanding of older buildings will also benefit from the relational approach. David Leatherbarrow's ''Uncommon Ground,'' a book due in October from MIT Press, revisits the work of Richard Neutra and other mid-20th century modernists to show that so-called International Style architects were often acutely sensitive to the local particulars of their building sites. By emphasizing the section (the cutaway view) over the plan and elevation, Leatherbarrow demonstrates how modern construction methods introduced a new connection between the interior and the exterior of buildings.</p>
        <p>PHILIPPE STARCK specializes in the surreal dimension of the inside-outside equation. The hotels Starck has designed for Ian Schrager typically contrast a minimally remodeled exterior with rooms that retain a sense of unfamiliarity despite Starck's repeated use of signature motifs. The 1,000-room Hudson, Schrager's latest oasis of style at (356 West 58th St.), features a year-round private garden -- a Gramercy Park for sophisticated transients -- furnished with overscaled, Alice in Wonderlandish horticultural tools.  Guest rooms will feature bedside lamps with shades painted by Francesco Clemente.</p>
        <p>Also due this fall: the final design for Schrager's Astor hotel, in the East Village.  A collaboration between Rem Koolhaas and the Swiss team Herzog and de Meuron, this will be Schrager's first ground-up building. It also signifies the idea of collaboration as architecture's new wave.</p>
