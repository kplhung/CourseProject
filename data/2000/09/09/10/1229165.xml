        <p>YOU seldom come across a film in which a father advises his son to forget about going to medical, law, or business school and, please, to concentrate instead on learning to dance Siegfried in ''Swan Lake.'' (Of course this could change if anyone ever films ''The Peter and Nilas Martins Story,'' about the father and son who are, respectively, ballet master and principal dancer at the New York City Ballet.) Furthermore, in the traditionally masculine working-class screen world of coal miners, steelworkers and meatpackers, real men who sweat for their pay by day don't dream that their sons will abandon wrestling or football to perfect their tours jetes.</p>
        <p>But in two fall films, ''Billy Elliot'' and ''Bootmen,'' an English coal miner and an Australian steelworker come to terms with sons who follow the passion in their feet. Dancing not only reunites father and son but exhilaratingly redefines masculinity. Billy Elliot, at age 11, jetes his way out of the bleakness of a North England coal miners' strike to the pristine classical beauty of the Royal Ballet's London school. The Bootman, a 20-something steelworker, not only organizes his own dance troupe but rescues his community with a benefit when the local plant is shut down. In two other movies, ''Save the Last Dance,'' which opens in January, and ''The Dancer,'' opening Sept. 22, dance becomes an instrument of salvation for the main characters. The first is about a romance between a ballet-loving white girl and a hip-hop-loving black boy in Chicago; the second is a French film set in New York, where a mute dancer tries to make it on Broadway. As in Stephen Daldry's ''Billy Elliot,'' which opens Oct. 13, and Dein Perry's ''Bootmen,'' arriving Oct. 6, dance has the power to change and connect lives.</p>

        <p>But in two fall films, ''Billy Elliot'' and ''Bootmen,'' an English coal miner and an Australian steelworker come to terms with sons who follow the passion in their feet. Dancing not only reunites father and son but exhilaratingly redefines masculinity. Billy Elliot, at age 11, jetes his way out of the bleakness of a North England coal miners' strike to the pristine classical beauty of the Royal Ballet's London school. The Bootman, a 20-something steelworker, not only organizes his own dance troupe but rescues his community with a benefit when the local plant is shut down. In two other movies, ''Save the Last Dance,'' which opens in January, and ''The Dancer,'' opening Sept. 22, dance becomes an instrument of salvation for the main characters. The first is about a romance between a ballet-loving white girl and a hip-hop-loving black boy in Chicago; the second is a French film set in New York, where a mute dancer tries to make it on Broadway. As in Stephen Daldry's ''Billy Elliot,'' which opens Oct. 13, and Dein Perry's ''Bootmen,'' arriving Oct. 6, dance has the power to change and connect lives.</p>
        <p>When Billy Elliot is interviewed by the tribunal of judges at the Royal Ballet about his dancing, the shy boy, overwhelmed by the formality of the process, mostly answers ''I dunno.'' But when he is asked, finally, ''What does it feel like when you're dancing?'' he smiles with a youthful glint of genius: ''I disappear when I'm dancing. There's a change in my whole body. It's like electricity.''</p>
        <p>Dance on film can capture a young artist's ability to soar above circumstances. Billy looks for a book with pictures of the great pas de deux in a public library that operates out of a mobile trailer. What is so mysterious about great dancers -- how they know at such an early age to commit to a highly disciplined and classical art -- is illuminated by Mr. Daldry in the contrast between the rudimentary calm of the ballet barre and the grueling coal miner's strike.</p>
        <p>The determination of a young dancer is not a new subject for film. Nor is the added fish-out-of-water twist. In ''Flashdance,'' the popular disco-meets-Petipa hit of the 80's, Alex, the girl welder by day and club dancer by night, aspires to audition for the Pittsburgh Ballet Academy. Even in the title song, which she performs with a cross section of jazz, disco and ballet moves, the lyrics remind the audience to ''take your passion and make it happen.'' It's not just about getting into a company but fulfilling individual potential. My assistant, Angela Trento, a 30-something single career woman, told me, ''I saw 'Flashdance' 10 times. That girl was tough, sexy, and she made it on her own. That movie made me think I could do that too.''</p>
        <p>In fact it doesn't happen only in the movies. Kevin McKenzie, the former principal dancer with American Ballet Theater who is now the company's artistic director, was born in Burlington, Vt., the son of a meatpacker. Interestingly, his father did have aspirations for Kevin to become a tap dancer, like Fred Astaire. He sent his boy for lessons at the very school where his sister studied ballet. Mr. McKenzie had no facility for time steps but took an immediate shine to ballet. When his father came to the school recital expecting to see a young man in top hat and tails, he found him in tights.</p>
        <p>LIKE Billy Elliot, the young Mr. McKenzie dropped all his sports -- another move his father never expected -- and concentrated on  plies. A local dance teacher who saw his potential was determined to help Kevin and his sister get professional training. At 12, Mr. McKenzie auditioned for the renowned teacher Mary Day, at the Washington School of Ballet, and the course of his life was set: he and his sister left home to study ballet. Because of illness, his father never saw him dance. ''Oh, he was very supportive,'' Mr. McKenzie says fondly. ''He just was disappointed I wasn't Fred Astaire.''</p>
        <p>Billy Elliot's father saves his hard-earned money so his gangly son can study wrestling. He has no idea that at the local gym ballet is also being taught, by a middle-class smoker played by Julie Walters. (These local teachers are key to every success story, real or fantasy.) Mr. Elliot is shocked when he is told by his neighbors that his son is dancing with girls in tutus. He insists that the boy stop -- and that he cancel his audition in London. Mr. Elliot has never been to London, much less the ballet, but he knows what's best.</p>
        <p>As in all dance movies, art conquers all. Not only does Mr. Elliot crack, he is even willing to cross a picket line to pay for his son's audition. ''What if he's a genius?'' he asks of the coal miners trapped in a gray world of no pay and police brutality. In a class-driven society, a boy's ability will break the impenetrable barriers.</p>
        <p>The steelworking brothers in ''Bootmen''  have an even harder-headed father. But these brothers are not interested in escaping into an orderly classical world. Their dancing is gritty, low and hard -- like the steelworks. The boots beat out the rhythm of frustration and fear in a technological society that endangers their survival. It is not until one of the sons dies in a low-life tangle that the father recognizes the power and urgency of their tap dancing.</p>
        <p>Dance in film and theater seems to be emerging as an antidote to an isolated, cyberspace existence. In the Tony-winning musical ''Contact,'' an alienated advertising man renews his life by dancing with a stranger in a yellow dress. My own mother, Lola, who has been taking jazz dance classes for 40 years, swears to me, ''I feel alive when I'm dancing. Otherwise I go stale.''</p>
        <p>In the last shot of ''Billy Elliot,'' the frail 11-year-old emerges as a beautiful swan, played by the riveting Royal Ballet dancer Adam Cooper. The Bootmen, who are based on the dance group Tap Dogs, become as popular and magnetic as visiting rock royalty: we see a stadium audience go into an almost soccer-crowd frenzy.</p>
        <p>In a world of MTV videos, where most filmed dance is devoid of personal meaning, these films explore the soul of dancers who, like Gene Kelly, have ''gotta dance!'' And that dancing, that release from grounded expectations, will bring a coal miner and his son to Covent Garden, where, when the lights go down and the dancer leaps onto the stage, the most beautiful illusion becomes reality.</p>
        <p>FILM Wendy Wasserstein's new play, ''Old Money,'' will be presented by Lincoln Center Theater this fall.</p>
