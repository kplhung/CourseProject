        <p>''Battleground Scranton,'' said a banner headline in The Tribune here on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''It's beginning to seem as though they're running for president of Pennsylvania,'' commented The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Little wonder. This week alone, Vice President Al Gore campaigned in Philadelphia on Sunday, Pittsburgh on Monday and the Scranton area on Thursday. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was in Allentown and Scranton on Tuesday, Scranton on Wednesday and Pittsburgh on Friday. Lest anyone's attention wander, Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush's running mate, hit the Philadelphia suburbs.</p>
        <p>By early this week, the Democrats and the Republicans had each spent more than $5 million in Pennsylvania, in soft money and hard, on television advertising. By late this week, Mr. Bush had been to the state 14 times and Mr. Gore had made no fewer than 17 campaign visits. On the most recent one he pleased local chauvinists by commenting, ''I believe that this state is literally 'the Keystone state,' and I'm going to continue to spend an enormous amount of time here.''</p>
        <p>Hyperbole aside, Pennsylvania is one of the handful of states -- 6, 8, maybe 10, depending on who's counting -- where the presidential race of 2000 will be decided. Even after decades of population decline, it still casts 23 electoral votes, more than any other closely contested state. So when public and private polls suggested the start of a slide toward Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush stormed in to try to halt the slide, and the vice president arrived to try to keep the momentum going.</p>
        <p>''No question about it,'' Gov. Tom Ridge, a Bush confidant, said in an interview. ''Gore got a huge bump out of his party's convention. It was very surprising, an enigma to me. But I'll tell you, we're not in such bad shape. Even or a few points behind, running against the vice president when times are good, a strong economy and no war -- sign me up, I'll take a shot.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ridge said he thought Mr. Bush needed to ''maximize voters' chances to see him personally, because he's the more likable of the two candidates, close up.'' Mr. Bush seems to be moving in that direction, with his staff's promises on Thursday to hold town meetings like the ones he held in the primaries.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Ridge did not say, but virtually every other politician in the state has been saying for weeks, is that Mr. Bush has been handicapped by his vice-presidential choice. Had he chosen Mr. Ridge, the pros here say, he would have won the state with ease and gained in other states that are witnessing hand-to-hand political combat this fall, like Michigan.</p>
        <p>But instead of making that choice, said Prof. Joseph DiSarro, chairman of the political science department at Washington and Jefferson College, ''he chose Dick Cheney, who has been a dud.''</p>
        <p>''No excitement at all,'' Professor DiSarro added. ''Two white Anglo-Saxon Protestant males, which doesn't put much of a fresh face on the Republican Party. Whereas the Democrats chose Lieberman, who's perfect for Pennsylvania -- a very personable but unconventional and socially conservative Democrat.''</p>
        <p>This is a somewhat unconventional state, politically speaking. It has relatively few registered independents. It has almost half a million more registered Democrats than registered Republicans, but the Democrats are an unorthodox breed -- more conservative than most in their party and much less supportive of ideas like abortion rights and gun control. Bill Clinton carried the state easily in 1992 and 1996, but Republicans control the governorship, three of the four other statewide offices and both Senate seats.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, given the paucity of officially independent voters, party-lining does not play well here. A candidate is ''better off here to be viewed as an independent,'' Mr. Ridge said, ''because up-and-down anything -- liberal, conservative -- is not good.''</p>
        <p>Pennsylvania's population of 12 million is older than that of most states; many young people leave, and few come from elsewhere. Only 13 Congressional districts have older populations than Representative Paul E. Kanjorski's district, centered on Wilkes-Barre, a weary anthracite coal town southwest of here, and all 13 are in the retirement havens of Florida and Arizona.</p>
        <p>In Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, hardscrabble places with scores of vacant and boarded-up buildings downtown, people count on Washington for help. For decades, they got it from their men in Washington, Representatives Daniel J. Flood and Joseph M. McDade, but both left office under clouds of scandal. Some local people still say of them, ''If they stole, at least they stole for us.''</p>
        <p>So issues like Social Security, Medicare and especially prescription drugs, important everywhere this fall, are critical in this region and this state. Both candidates have shown commercials about health care in Pennsylvania, and next month a group from Scranton and elsewhere in the state is taking a bus trip to Canada to buy drugs, because they are cheaper there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kanjorski, a Democrat, recently held eight town meetings on health issues and drew the largest crowds of his career -- more than 500 people in some cases, many of them recently left in the lurch when two of the area's major managed care plans, run by Blue Cross and Geisinger, were closed.</p>
        <p>Under pressure for weeks to state a detailed position on prescription drugs, Mr. Bush did so on his visits to Allentown and Scranton, proposing a plan that would rely much more heavily than Mr. Gore's on the states and on the big health care providers. Mr. Ridge had been among those pressing him in private conversations, and he enthusiastically supported the new Bush plan. Pennsylvania already has the largest state prescription drug program, paid for by state lottery money; it will cost $290 million this year.</p>
        <p>Mindful of the need to attract uncommitted voters, who here as elsewhere tend to be turned off by excessive partisanship, Mr. Bush repeatedly promised a bipartisan approach to the health care problem and mentioned Democratic senators with whom he said he could work well, like John B. Breaux of Louisiana.</p>
        <p>''We are in a very critical week,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, which studies news coverage. ''The question is, will Bush get the traction he needs on this issue? The proposals are complicated, but what emerges from the media is pretty simple: Both have plans now; Gore would spend more money.''</p>
        <p>One of those who lost coverage, Jacob Nykaza of Jermyn, near Scranton, told The Tribune: ''We have to decide who has the better program. Either one should be better than nothing.'' His medications cost $35 a week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did something else here that could have a considerable impact among the large numbers of Roman Catholic voters in Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, most of whom strongly oppose abortion, as does Mr. Bush. There are no abortion clinics in Lackawanna County (Scranton) or Luzerne County (Wilkes-Barre). Although he said nothing publicly about abortion, Mr. Bush paid a well-publicized 40-minute call on Bishop James C. Timlin of Scranton.</p>
        <p>The bishop, an outspoken opponent of abortion, said afterward that the visit had nothing to do with politics. But it certainly sent a message, especially since he had forbidden a planned appearance this year by Mr. Gore, an abortion rights supporter, at the Catholic Mercy Hospital here.</p>
        <p>''This means the church has given its tacit approval to Bush,'' said Steve Corbett, a columnist for The News-Leader in Wilkes-Barre. ''That's how people will interpret it. You're in the heart of anti-abortion country.''</p>
        <p>This area is not nearly as populous, of course, as Philadelphia or Pittsburgh. But it is closely balanced in partisan terms. Representative Donald L. Sherwood, whose district is centered on Scranton, won by only 515 votes in 1996, defeating Patrick Casey, a son of former Gov. Robert Casey and a brother of the state auditor, Robert Casey Jr. Mr. Casey, a Democrat, is running again, which should guarantee a big turnout and a close presidential contest in a district that President Clinton won in 1996 but lost to President George Bush in 1992.</p>
        <p>''This election is about two things,'' said Prof. G. Terry Madonna of Millersville University. ''Can Gore hold onto the socially conservative working-class Catholics in the hard-coal country in the northeast and the soft-coal country in the southwest, the ones you call Reagan Democrats and we call Casey Democrats? And can Bush hold onto the weakly leaning Republicans, fiscally conservative but not antigovernment, in the suburban counties around Philadelphia, especially the well-educated women?''</p>
        <p>A poll taken for KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh on Sept. 5 and 6 and released on Thursday put Mr. Gore at 53 percent and Mr. Bush at 42 percent, with 4 percent opting for other candidates and 1 percent undecided. The survey questioned 800 likely voters, pushing them to state a preference even if they were unsure; the margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.</p>
        <p>Professor Madonna, a pollster himself, said he thought Mr. Gore's lead was more like four to six percentage points. He said that because he did not believe the race had settled yet, he had delayed a new poll until later this month.</p>
        <p>All the polls show big gender gaps. A poll taken for another western Pennsylvania television station, WPXI, indicates that Mr. Gore's entire margin comes from women. And they all show Mr. Bush fading in the pivotal suburban counties that surround Philadelphia -- Bucks, Montgomery, Delaware and Chester.</p>
        <p>Neil Oxman, a Democratic campaign consultant in Philadelphia, said the Republican National Convention, held there, was the catalyst. Polls Mr. Oxman has taken for local and regional candidates, he said, show that Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have consolidated 92 to 93 percent of their bases, which yields Mr. Gore a significant advantage, given the big Democratic registration edge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was doing nicely, he said, ''and then bam! this yawning gender gap opens up, and you suddenly have Gore running strongly in the Main Line, especially among the moderate and upscale women there.''</p>
        <p>With that constituency, abortion is hurting Mr. Bush, Ms. Jamieson of the Annenberg School said. Although he mentioned the subject only briefly in his acceptance speech, she said, his position, the platform position and that of Mr. Cheney were all discussed at length in the local news media during the convention.</p>
        <p>''Voters here know just where he stands,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Battlegrounds</p>
        <p>This is the first article in a series about four swing states that are likely to be critical to the outcome of the presidential race. Later articles will look at Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan.</p>
