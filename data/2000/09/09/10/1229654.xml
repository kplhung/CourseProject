      <abstract>
        <p>Randy Cohen The Ethicist column answers questions about whether employee is taking advantage of his company by staying at expensive upscale hotel and receiving hotel credits, whether it is wrong for university professor to sell unsolicited copies of textbooks to book buyers and pocket the money, whether it would be wrong to record and sell to competitors tapes of telephone conversations overheard in office suite shared by different companies, whether it is wrong to work for a church and not believe in God and whether a friend should be told that stolen watch he bought and thought was genuine is fake (M)</p>

        <p>Two of us at work travel to the same city to check on our project. One stays at an expensive upscale hotel and receives hotel credits. The other chooses to stay at a much cheaper hotel, closer to the job and equally nice, but without that bonus. Is the first person taking advantage of the corporation?</p>
        <p>-- B. K., St. Paul</p>
        <p>If your bonus-loving colleague adheres to the company's rules on travel and is honest with the boss, he's doing nothing underhanded. While it is a fine thing to minimize expenses to your employer, you are not obliged to squeeze dimes by pitching tents beside the Interstates. In fact, choosing more austere quarters could be false economy. Your boss may prefer you pampered and pleased; that can make for a more productive worker. If hotel credits contribute to your coworker's contentment, there's no harm in that.</p>

        <p>-- B. K., St. Paul</p>
        <p>If your bonus-loving colleague adheres to the company's rules on travel and is honest with the boss, he's doing nothing underhanded. While it is a fine thing to minimize expenses to your employer, you are not obliged to squeeze dimes by pitching tents beside the Interstates. In fact, choosing more austere quarters could be false economy. Your boss may prefer you pampered and pleased; that can make for a more productive worker. If hotel credits contribute to your coworker's contentment, there's no harm in that.</p>
        <p>To forestall the resentment a frugal traveler may feel for a sybaritic colleague, you might suggest that your boss offer each employee a standard travel allowance and a choice: squander it on high living or choose modest accommodations and pocket the savings. Or the boss might have one travel agent make the arrangements for all employees, booking everyone into similar accommodations. Or he could issue everyone a folding tent and a road map and enjoy the team spirit engendered by common suffering.</p>
        <p>I'm a university professor, and I often get unsolicited copies of textbooks from publishers hoping that I'll adopt them for my course. They clutter up my shelves until book buyers come through, offering cash for old texts. Is it wrong for me to sell them and pocket the money? Should I donate them instead?</p>
        <p>-- Anonymous, Evanston, Ill.</p>
        <p>The publishers sent the books hoping you'd find them worthy of inclusion in your class. They were not a bribe. They're yours to do with what you will. Not every perk is a transgression. (At a TV show where I worked, we received many T-shirts emblazoned with the names of Kevin Costner movies; I saw using them to clean up after the cat as a legitimate form of film criticism.) Unless university policy prohibits your selling these books, go to it.</p>
        <p>If you still feel uneasy, note that some magazines give unsolicited books to the public library; others offer them to their unpaid interns. Consider following their examples or donating your book money to a student-aid organization.</p>
        <p>I work in an office suite shared by different companies. The occupants of the offices across from mine spend their day with the door open, on the speakerphone, screaming about their firm's key strategic and tactical decisions. I could easily record everything they say. Would it be legally and morally wrong to do so and sell the tapes to their competitors?</p>
        <p>-- Anonymous, New York</p>
        <p>Ethically, your plan is pretty shabby. If you're vexed by their screaming, why not ask your neighbors to keep it down? Their inconsiderate behavior does not justify your industrial espionage.</p>
        <p>I write the Ethicist, not the Legalist -- I am not qualified to rule on the legality of your contemplated scheme. I can caution you that the laws on taping vary from state to state, as Linda Tripp discovered to her dismay.</p>
        <p>I recently started a temp gig at a church, and they've intimated that they would like to hire me. I'm concerned that they'll ask me what my faith is -- agnostic on good days. I think they may have gotten the wrong idea because they saw me reading the Bible in the chapel. Is it wrong to work for a church and not believe in God?</p>
        <p>-- J. H., Toronto</p>
        <p>If your work is technical in nature -- bookkeeping, say, or plumbing, or even organ maintenance -- your own theological opinions are beside the point. This is not hypocrisy; it's tolerance. I doubt that the minister would object to his car being repaired by a Hindu, Muslim, Jew or atheist. Unless you have strong personal objections to that church's teachings, there is no reason you shouldn't work there.</p>
        <p>If, however, you're actually conducting services or otherwise participating in the church's spiritual life, all concerned would probably feel much better if your personal beliefs were in accord with the congregation's. And if you refrained from playing ''In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida'' on the organ.</p>
        <p>A friend purchased what he thought was a stolen fine watch, at a discount. I can see from the way it has worn that it is not authentic. Should I tell him? I don't want to shatter his love for it or insult him. But I also don't want him to remain misled or make this mistake again.</p>
        <p>-- M. R., New York</p>
        <p>If I understand correctly, what was thought merely to be a case of receiving stolen goods turned out instead to be a swindle involving counterfeit products, and it's unclear to you if continued deception on your part is the honorable way to treat a friend and his bauble? I'm just relieved that no one got killed. And now I've got to go lie down a put a cold compress on my forehead.</p>
