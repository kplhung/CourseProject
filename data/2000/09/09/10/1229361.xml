        <p>BY now, the auto-buying public largely understands that few makes and models are unique, but that they are assemblages of parts shared with other products from the same manufacturer. What may be surprising is the extent to which different cars use the same pieces.</p>
        <p>Think of the car-designing process as a giant buffet. In planning its LeSabre, Buick filled its plate with various General Motors components, ultimately ending up with the same platform, engine, transmission and brakes that Pontiac scooped up for its  Bonneville. The garnishes and side dishes were different, and the LeSabre got some extra whipped topping for dessert, but the meals were much the same.</p>
        <p>The platform -- the basic architecture of a car's unit-body construction -- is the crucial ingredient. If an automaker has an exceptional platform, it can mix and match components to create a variety of cars that look different, have distinct images and appeal to different buyers. This approach runs counter to cookie-cutter lineups like Chrysler's K-cars, which looked and performed much the same regardless of size or price.</p>
        <p>Volkswagen and Audi, both part of Volkswagen A.G., have often shared platforms successfully, enabling them to divide the huge costs of developing new cars. When VW needed an attention-getter, it looked no further than the platform of its Golf and Jetta. It added a new body with a characteristic shape, and the New Beetle was born. When Audi wanted to make a statement with a high-style sporty car, the same platform was waiting. The TT coupe was born, followed by a TT roadster.</p>
        <p>For 1996, Audi introduced the very successful A4 compact sedan. As with other Audis, it had an engine mounted longitudinally -- that is, from front to back, not from side to side as it is in the VW Golf and Jetta -- and was available with Audi's highly regarded quattro all-wheel drive.</p>
        <p>The VW Passat, meanwhile, languished. Then in 1998, the Passat, which had been imported since 1990, was completely redesigned on a slightly stretched version of the Audi A4 platform. The midsize VW ended up with a wheelbase almost as long as the one on Audi's upscale A6. This Passat cost less than the A4 but had slightly more room inside and a better ride, too. Sales took off.</p>
        <p>Audi's big remaining edge was the fact that it could be ordered with quattro all-wheel drive, a reassuring feature in bad-weather driving. But now VW has leveled the field with the addition this year of the Passat 4Motion, its version of quattro.</p>
        <p>The 4Motion system is a $1,650 option on GLS and GLX sedans and wagons, but only in combination with a 2.8-liter V-6 engine -- the same one used in Audis -- and an automatic transmission. Thus, Volkswagen has upped the ante by offering Audi's main attractions at VW prices. Some fraternal cannibalism seems unavoidable, with VW taking a bite out of Audi's market.</p>
        <p>I have just finished driving one of the most sought-after Passats, the top-line GLX 4Motion wagon. Although the A4 and Passat wagons look similar and share engines, transmissions and accessories, there are differences. One is that the Passat's longer wheelbase adds almost 2 inches of rear-seat legroom to the wagon and sedan, and several inches to the wagon's cargo area. VW's own figures show the Passat wagon has 36 cubic feet behind the second seat, compared with the A4's 31.3 cubic feet. With the rear seats down, the VW has 74 cubic feet versus the Audi's 63.7. Among all-wheel-drive station wagons, the Passat's cargo volume is greater than all but the Mercedes E320 wagon, even beating the new Volvo V70.</p>
        <p>Another difference is price. The GLX wagon that I tested has a list price of $31,705, including the destination, or delivery, charge. Its only options were 4Motion and the required automatic transmission. An Audi A4 quattro 2.8 wagon, with the same engine and similar equipment, is $34,420, a difference of $2,715. Comparably equipped, a four-cylinder version of the Audi A4, the 1.8 Turbo, is $29,980 with quattro and automatic transmission. But a Passat GLS 4Motion is even less, starting at about $28,000, and comes with a V-6.</p>
        <p>With the introduction of the 4Motion system, the Passat has made a giant step toward parity with the A4. In today's market, customer preference seems to be for some sort of a sport utility, but not one that's too trucklike, and an all-wheel or four-wheel-drive system that is not cumbersome or awkward to use. Subaru has had great success with its all-wheel-drive sedans and wagons, and others are following. But Audi's quattro remains the gold standard of road-going all-wheel-drive systems.</p>
        <p>The specifications make it clear that 4Motion and quattro are one and the same. Both are designed to work with a longitudinal engine. Both have an automatic-locking center differential that distributes engine torque to the front and rear axles in a 50/50 split so that all four wheels equally divide it. Under conditions when slippage occurs with either a front or a rear wheel, the differential can send up to two-thirds of the torque to the wheels that have the best grip. Both have an electronic locking differential in front and rear axles that limit how much each wheel can spin, sending more torque to a wheel on the other side that has traction.</p>
        <p>The quattro and 4Motion systems operate seamlessly and transparently. Other manufacturers claim seamless operation, but in my experience only Subaru's system is equivalent to Audi's, and now VW's. Most others operate either the front or rear wheels all the time unless a loss of traction occurs, at which time the center differential diverts power to the wheels with traction. Unfortunately, this diversion of torque is often noticeable and sometimes annoying.</p>
        <p>Another advantage of the VW-Audi systems is that with the combination of a locking center differential and torque-splitting axle differentials, an Audi or VW can drive away even if only one wheel has traction. Many four-wheel-drive systems do not have this capability; in some, the vehicle cannot move if only one wheel lacks traction.</p>
        <p>Will this updated Passat take sales from the Audi A4? That seems likely. There remain only a few reasons to choose the Audi: Its name is more presitigious; its styling may be more appealing to some, and it comes with a warranty and free service for 3 years or 50,000 miles, compared with 2 years or 24,000 miles for the VW.</p>
