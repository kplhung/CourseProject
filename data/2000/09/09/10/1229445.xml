        <p>More than four months after 21 people were seized in their beach clothes from a remote diving resort, the last four Westerners were freed today from the jungle by Muslim rebel kidnappers.</p>
        <p>The ransom for the final French, German and Finnish hostages was reported to be $1 million each, part of $25 million promised to the kidnappers by Libya, which has acted as a go-between.</p>
        <p>Gaunt and bearded, Marc Wallert of Germany raised his arms in the air when he stepped off a helicopter after 140 days in captivity. ''It feels great!'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the hostage-taking is not over. The gunmen are still holding 2 French television journalists who trekked into the mountains to interview them in July and 12 Filipino evangelical Christians who paid $3,000 plus 50 sacks of rice to be allowed into their camp to pray.</p>
        <p>The last of the original 21 hostages -- the lone Filipino among them -- also remained in captivity.</p>
        <p>A separate band of kidnappers from the same rebel group, Abu Sayyaf, is holding an American, Jeffrey Schilling, 24, a Muslim convert from California who went to visit them, apparently out of curiosity, on Aug. 29.</p>
        <p>Over the months, the kidnappings have been marked by incompetence, violence, secret payoffs and fitful releases punctuated by dozens of new kidnappings. Promises have been made and broken as the kidnappers have feuded and fought among themselves over their spoils.</p>
        <p>Today's release effort almost collapsed when two go-betweens, accompanied by the chief kidnapper -- a man nicknamed Robot because he can dance like Michael Jackson -- were ambushed by men with automatic weapons and grenade launchers. Government negotiators said one bodyguard was killed and eight others wounded, along with a large number of civilians.</p>
        <p>The chief Philippine negotiator, Roberto Aventajado, said the attackers were a rival rebel faction. Though he refused to say so, the go-betweens were believed to be carrying ransom money with them.</p>
        <p>''We were not sure at all of being released today,'' said one of the freed hostages, Stephane Loisy of France. ''We heard the shooting where we were located. And suddenly we were taken in a car and we were actually freed.''</p>
        <p>The remaining hostages face an uncertain future. The releases so far have been slowed by demands for more and more money and by the  kidnappers' fears of a military offensive once their hostages are gone.</p>
        <p>The military has held back in response to the demands of the Western governments whose citizens were being detained. With the release of the last of those hostages, Vice President Gloria Arroyo Macapagal said Friday, ''it's possible that we may change our tactics.''</p>
        <p>A Libyan envoy, Rajab Azzarouq, said negotiators would now seek the release of the two French journalists. According to local reports, they were not released today because the Libyans declined to pay for them. ''Practically, it is very difficult, but we will try,'' Mr. Azzarouq said.</p>
        <p>Negotiations for the release of Mr. Schilling may be even more difficult. He is being held by a faction that has tortured and killed previous hostages and that is reported to be angry at the American, who is said to have argued with them and tried to break out of his holding pen.</p>
        <p>The United States has stated that as a matter of policy, it would not pay ransom or make deals for his release. In response, a spokesman for the kidnappers repeated a threat to kill him, telling a local radio station this week, ''The United States may have a policy, but we also have our own policy.''</p>
        <p>With the going rate for the hostages set at $1 million each, the spokesman said earlier that he thought an American ought to be worth 10 times that amount.</p>
        <p>Kidnapping for ransom is a well-established business in the islands of the Sulu Sea, which have been home to pirates and bandits for centuries. Abu Sayyaf, a tiny breakaway rebel band, seized the vacationers, along with several local workers, from the a Malaysian island on April 23.</p>
        <p>Because of the ransom payments, there is so much money now in the remote southern island of Jolo that the local exchange rate for the dollar has reportedly fallen by 50 percent, and the price of weapons has soared.</p>
        <p>It is more money than the rebels seem to know what to do with. Two of them were seized at a small local bank when they tried to convert $240,000 into pesos.</p>
        <p>The kidnappers received $5.5 million for their first 11 releases of Malaysian and German hostages, the Philippine military said. Libya paid another $6 million two weeks ago for six more Westerners -- a German, two South Africans and three French women.</p>
        <p>In addition, they have been paid for releasing a dozen other journalists who were seized when they went to interview the hostages.</p>
