        <p>READING AND WRITING</p>
        <p>A Personal Account.</p>
        <p>By V. S. Naipaul.</p>
        <p>New York Review, $16.95.</p>
        <p>In virtually every one of his 24 books, V.S. Naipaul returns, with obsessive regularity, to the problem of beginnings -- his own beginnings as an ambitious Indian boy from Trinidad who desperately wanted to become a great writer, and the elusive beginnings of the Asian, African and Caribbean peoples whose displaced histories and native cultures he depicts with trademark ambivalence. ''Reading and Writing: A Personal Account'' joins together two beautifully written essays. The first is on Naipaul's development as a writer whose struggles with the modern novel and its ''metropolitan assumptions about society'' ultimately force him to clarify his own literary project; the second concerns Naipaul's relationship to India and the complex literary and cultural inheritance that has been the catalyst for his life's work. The two essays are related because Naipaul comes to see that the world of the modern novel is predicated upon the magical disappearance of his own colonial past: ''Unlike the metropolitan writer I had no knowledge of a past. The past of our community ended, for most of us, with our grandfathers; beyond that we could not see.'' Naipaul insists that it was in the course of recovering and remaking this past, made ugly by the unflattering faces of slavery and economic oppression, that he found his voice and identified his powers as a writer. He elegantly expresses hard-earned wisdom about literature and culture, the political stakes of history and the relationship between the writer and the world.</p>
