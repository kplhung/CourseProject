        <p>Seventeen of the East End's 25 producers participated in this year's New York Wine and Food Classic, the state's major contest devoted only to New York wine, but the outcome belonged to the Finger Lakes region.</p>
        <p>Every top award went to wineries on Seneca Lake, the first time that one region swept everything in the 15-year history of the classic. The contest, held Aug. 30-31 at Scribner Hollow Lodge, in the Catskills town of Hunter, is sponsored by the New York Wine and Grape Foundation, an industry- and state-financed trade organization in Penn Yan in the Finger Lakes.</p>
        <p>Long Island wines that won double-gold medals were Peconic Bay, for its '98 chardonnay ($10), named best chardonnay in the contest, and Pindar, for its '97 cabernet port ($25).</p>
        <p>Double-gold medals required the unanimous vote of the 16 judges, who gave them to 17 of the 442 wines tasted.</p>
        <p>Single gold medals went to Macari, for its '97 Bergen Road ($32), voted the state's best red blend; Gristina (renamed Galluccio Estate Vineyards under new ownership), for its '98 Andy's Field reserve chardonnay ($22); Palmer, for its '99 gewurztraminer ($15); Paumanok, for its '98 barrel-fermented chardonnay ($17); Pindar, for its '95 syrah ($25); and Ternhaven, for its '97 Claret d'Alvah ($24), a red blend.</p>
        <p>The show's top winner was the '99 dry riesling from Chateau LaFayette Reneau, on the east side of Seneca. The $11 wine was voted best riesling, best white wine and best wine of show.</p>
        <p>The Finger Lakes, with 70 wineries, entered 300 wines; Long Island, with 25 wineries, 75 wines; Hudson Valley, 28 wines; Lake Erie, 20 wines; 2 came from elsewhere; and there were 17 ringers. The 16 judges, 7 of them non-New Yorkers, included journalists and people in  the wine trade.</p>
