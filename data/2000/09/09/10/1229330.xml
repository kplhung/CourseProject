        <p>Some see it as never-never land. To me, Fire Island Pines seems more like an Island of Lost Boys, a place with the lowest per capita body fat this side of the Olympics. Without pecs, abs or a fixation with house music, you can feel pretty invisible there, at least that's what I decided in June, when I tried out my summer share. At 42 with a 34-inch waist, how could I feel at home there?</p>
        <p>I did not make a reappearance until one Tuesday at the very end of August, when I had my little niece and nephew in tow. I knew they'd be oblivious to what makes the Pines irksome to me. On the ferry, they didn't overhear two young men behind us yapping about being ''tweaked'' on drugs at a recent party where some guy was dancing naked on a table.</p>

        <p>Some see it as never-never land. To me, Fire Island Pines seems more like an Island of Lost Boys, a place with the lowest per capita body fat this side of the Olympics. Without pecs, abs or a fixation with house music, you can feel pretty invisible there, at least that's what I decided in June, when I tried out my summer share. At 42 with a 34-inch waist, how could I feel at home there?</p>
        <p>I did not make a reappearance until one Tuesday at the very end of August, when I had my little niece and nephew in tow. I knew they'd be oblivious to what makes the Pines irksome to me. On the ferry, they didn't overhear two young men behind us yapping about being ''tweaked'' on drugs at a recent party where some guy was dancing naked on a table.</p>
        <p>Once we were in the harbor, the parade of sleek, tan torsos did not escape 8-year-old Madeleine's notice. ''Uncle Bobby,'' she asked, ''is it a custom or a law here not to wear a shirt?''</p>
        <p>Later, on the beach, she was perplexed to see so many little dogs but no little people. ''Maybe it's easier to be a dog here than a child,'' she said.</p>
        <p>That would depend on who you ask, I think. Rob Levy and David Schutte, for instance, are the adoptive fathers of a toddler I met while there. They think the Pines has been great for their son, know other new parents who feel the same way and continue to share rentals with childless, child-friendly gay men.</p>
        <p>Of course, sometimes the remarks can get a little mean. The first time Mr. Levy took his son, Ethan, to see the ocean, a muscular man said, ''Wouldn't a dog be easier?'' On the ferry, a man remarked that at least pets don't talk back, and once a woman asked what little Ethan's ''mix'' was, as if he were a dog, not a person. ''I just told her sperm and egg,'' said Mr. Levy, who thinks (as does the American Psychological Association) that many gay people make great parents.</p>
        <p>''I already had two childhoods, my second being from the age of 25 to 35,'' he said. ''And I didn't want to be in my 40's and still be out looking at cute guys on Ecstasy without a big accomplishment to show for all the years of my life.''</p>
        <p>I know what he means. Being an uncle, while not nearly as monumental as having children of my own, has made me a deeper person in many ways. It also made Fire Island a lot easier to take. There is, after all, nothing like some innocence to undermine decadence, and nothing more grounding on a beach swarming with gay eye candy than a fearless child in need of vigilant monitoring in the surf.</p>
        <p>Sure, we found many people looking right through us. But we got more than our share of warm smiles too. There was a handsome bartender at the Blue Whale, a former first-grade teacher in California, who listened eagerly to 5-year-old Ian's discourse on his favorite book, ''Captain Underpants.''</p>
        <p>There was a caller at community bingo who made a big fuss over the few children in attendance. There was Kevin Sessums, a Vanity Fair writer, who told Madeleine that she was pretty and that he loved her bathing suit.</p>
        <p>Then there was Gregg Benoff, a retired police officer, who is the community's unofficial ''chief security officer.'' When Ian, who has a raging potty mouth, yelled out ''penis'' and ''tushy'' apropos of nothing in particular, Mr. Benoff didn't miss a beat. ''Around here that could be a real icebreaker, son,'' he told him.</p>
        <p>We swam. We had wheelbarrow rides on the boardwalk. We watched ''Little Rascals'' videos. We learned that ''tea'' in local parlance means Happy Hour and that, no, it is not followed by Sad Hour, despite what some desperate souls would say.</p>
        <p>At the end of their stay, we were on the beach holding hands while two pierced, tattooed hunks strolled past, holding hands too. Standing there with two adoring children by my side, I realized that affection manifests itself in all kinds of ways in the world and that whether you enjoy staying a child forever or having children, we're all in this strange, new world together.</p>
        <p>''I'll be back, Uncle Bobby,'' Ian was yelling to me as he and his sister left the island with their father. ''I'll be back!''</p>
        <p>Who knows? I may be back next summer too, if I'm allowed.</p>
