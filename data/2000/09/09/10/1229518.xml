        <p>Washington 34, Miami 29</p>
        <p>Marques Tuiasosopo passed for a touchdown and ran for another, and the freshman Rich Alexis scored on a 50-yard run as No. 15 Washington beat No. 4 Miami, 34-29, yesterday in Seattle.</p>
        <p>The Huskies spoiled Miami's first trip to Husky Stadium. In the schools' first meeting in 1994 at the Orange Bowl, Washington ended the Hurricanes' N.C.A.A.-record 58-game home winning streak.</p>
        <p>Washington (2-0) led by 20-3 at halftime and took a 34-22 lead on the second play of the fourth quarter on Pat Conniff's 1-yard touchdown plunge.</p>
        <p>But the Hurricanes (1-1), taking advantage of Tuiasosopo's second interception of the fourth quarter and third turnover of the second half, scored on James Jackson's 1-yard run with 2 minutes 52 seconds to go to get to within 34-29. Todd Sievers' onside kick was recovered by Washington's Jerramy Stevens at the Miami 45 with 2:49 left. The Huskies couldn't get a first down, but were able to run the clock to 20 seconds.</p>
        <p>Florida State 26  Georgia Tech 21</p>
        <p>The No. 2 Seminoles were about to see their hopes of winning another national title fall apart in the second week of the season. But Chris Weinke did not come back to school to let that happen.</p>
        <p>Weinke, a 28-year-old senior, threw for a career-high 443 yards and 2 touchdowns and the Seminoles (2-0, 1-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) extended their winning streak to 14 in a row and improved their conference record to 63-2 since joining the A.C.C. in 1992.</p>
        <p>Southern Cal 17  Colorado 14</p>
        <p>David Newbury, who missed two field-goal tries, kicked a 24-yarder with 13 seconds left to lift the No. 11 Trojans over the visiting Buffaloes.</p>
        <p>Colorado's Mark Mariscal missed a 41-yard field-goal attempt with 1:14 remaining.</p>
        <p>Carson Palmer drove the Trojans 72 yards to the winning field goal, completing third-down passes of 23 yards and 19 yards to Kareem Kelly.</p>
        <p>Wisconsin 27, Oregon 23</p>
        <p>The Big Ten sprint champion Michael Bennett rushed for 290 yards and 2 long touchdowns as No. 5 Wisconsin outlasted Oregon, in Madison, Wis.</p>
        <p>The suspension-ridden Badgers got three interceptions from star cornerback Jamar Fletcher, whom Coach Barry Alvarez had considered sitting out. As it was, the Badgers (2-0) had to do without a dozen players who were suspended for receiving unadvertised discounts at a shoe store.</p>
        <p>Texas 52  Louisiana-Lafayette 10</p>
        <p>The quarterback controversy at Texas has not subsided. Major Applewhite came off the bench in the first quarter to rally the No. 6 Longhorns from a first-quarter deficit to a season-opening home romp over Louisiana-Lafayette.</p>
        <p>Applewhite, the 1999 Big 12 offensive player of the year had lost the much-publicized battle with the sophomore Chris Simms for the starting role.</p>
        <p>But Simms's first two possessions ended in a missed field goal and an interception return for a touchdown that gave the Ragin' Cajuns a 10-0 lead. Applewhite, looking fully recovered from the torn left knee ligament sustained in last season's Cotton Bowl loss to Arkansas which kept him out of spring drills, took over and led the Longhorns to 31 points before halftime. He made a strong statement to be the starter with 315 yards passing and 4 touchdowns in a little more than two quarters.</p>
        <p>S. Carolina 21, Georgia 10</p>
        <p>Lou Holtz's Gamecocks made it two in a row, stunning No. 9 Georgia to end an 18-game Southeastern Conference losing streak.</p>
        <p>South Carolina, which beat New Mexico State last week to end a 21-game losing streak, took advantage of Quincy Carter's career-high five interceptions, and the Gamecocks' defense made Derek Watson's three rushing scores hold up.</p>
        <p>Michigan 38, Rice 7</p>
        <p>Anthony Thomas ran for 131 yards on 14 carries and scored two first-quarter touchdowns as No. 3 Michigan used a  record start to beat visiting Rice. The Wolverines (2-0) scored 28 points on their first four possessions, breaking the school record of 24 first-quarter points.</p>
        <p>Florida 55  Middle Tennessee 0</p>
        <p>The backup Rex Grossman threw three touchdown passes to spark another Florida quarterback controversy as the eighth-ranked Gators beat Middle Tennessee at Gainesville, Fla.</p>
        <p>The redshirt freshman replaced Jesse Palmer in the middle of a series with his team leading 24-0, but coach Steve Spurrier apparently unhappy with the way his starter was throwing and moving the offense.</p>
        <p>Alabama 28, Vanderbilt 10</p>
        <p>Ahmaad Galloway ran for 172 yards on 13 carries, and No. 13 Alabama scored 18 points in the fourth quarter to beat visiting Vanderbilt.</p>
        <p>Purdue 45, Kent State 10</p>
        <p>Vinny Sutherland, suspended for disciplinary reasons for Purdue's opener, returned to score three touchdowns and had 192 total yards in the first half as No. 14 Boilermakers (2-0) routed visiting Kent State.</p>
        <p>Drew Brees continued his assault on Purdue and Big Ten records, throwing two touchdown passes and scoring two more on the ground. The senior completed 32 of 46 passes for 415 yards while becoming Purdue's career leader in total offense and completions.</p>
        <p>U.C.L.A. 24, Fresno St. 21</p>
        <p>The No. 16 Bruins followed their victory over Alabama by beating the visiting Bulldogs -- barely.</p>
        <p>DeShaun Foster ran for two fourth-quarter touchdowns and the Bruins (2-0) withstood two late touchdown passes from David Carr.</p>
        <p>Auburn 35, Mississippi 27</p>
        <p>The Tigers, with Rudi Johnson running for 165 yards and 2 touchdowns, defeated the 19th-ranked Rebels in Oxford, Miss., giving Coach Tommy Tuberville a victory over his former team.</p>
        <p>Deuce McAllister had 257 all-purpose yards and scored 3 touchdowns, including an 87-yard punt return for Mississippi (1-1, 0-1 Southeastern Conference).</p>
        <p>Michigan State 34  Marshall 24</p>
        <p>T. J. Duckett ran for 219 yards as No. 24 Michigan State topped Marshall, snapping the Thundering Herd's 18-game winning streak.</p>
        <p>IN OTHER GAMES</p>
        <p>Woodrow Dantzler threw two touchdown passes and ran for a third to lead No. 17 CLEMSON to a 62-9 rout of visiting MISSOURI. . . . Josh Heupel threw three touchdown passes and J.T. Thatcher returned a punt 66 yards for a touchdown on his way to a school record for returns as No. 20 OKLAHOMA (2-0) beat visiting ARKANSAS STATE, 45-7. Thatcher had 160 yards on five returns, breaking the Oklahoma record of 146 yards set last season by Jarrail Jackson against Missouri. . . . LaDainian Tomlinson ran for 176 yards and 3 touchdowns and No. 22 TEXAS CHRISTIAN sacked David Neill 12 times in the first half of a 41-10 rout at NEVADA.  . . . The freshman Philip Rivers passed for 401 yards and 5 touchdowns, three in the final quarter, as visiting NORTH CAROLINA STATE beat INDIANA, 41-38.</p>
