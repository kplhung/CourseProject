        <p>PETER SERKIN has never been an ordinary virtuoso. His deep concern with the music of living composers has brought him to work more than most solo pianists in collaborative contexts (his modest demeanor has surely helped here) and encouraged him to be unconventional in his programming. He is more likely to be found playing the piano part in Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire'' than that in a Rachmaninoff concerto, and any recital of his will probably include at least one contemporary piece.</p>
        <p>So he has all the qualities Judith Arron, the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall until her death in 1998, was looking for when she set about inviting a few musicians to imagine coherent sequences of concerts that they and others would give at the hall around the time of the new millennium. Last season Maurizio Pollini, Pierre Boulez and Daniel Barenboim presented their extensive Perspectives series; now (along with second seasons of Perspectives from Mr. Pollini and Mr. Barenboim) comes Mr. Serkin's turn, in a more compact group of concerts to take place in March 2001.</p>
        <p>Speaking recently at his summer home near Tanglewood in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts, Mr. Serkin, 53 and a son of the revered pianist Rudolf Serkin, recalled how Ms. Arron had worded her invitation.</p>
        <p>''She spoke about making music,'' he said. ''When I hear that phrase I immediately think of composers first, and so I decided I would have some very new music, with older music around that. At first the series was going to be much larger. As it's turned out, there are just four concerts, and in all of them the repertory begins in the 20th century. That was something that just happened, but I'm very pleased about it.''</p>
        <p>The concerts, utterly characteristic of Mr. Serkin's musical interests, include late works by Stravinsky, a little Schoenberg and Webern, and pieces by Stefan Wolpe and Toru Takemitsu to bring the story forward to music by five living composers: Charles Wuorinen, Peter Lieberson, Oliver Knussen, Alexander Goehr and George Benjamin.</p>
        <p>''Charles Wuorinen once said to me that a program ought to include a work by an old master, a work by a 20th-century master, a work by an older living composer and a work by a young composer,'' Mr. Serkin said. ''I've just left out the first category, though I would also have liked to include pieces by younger composers than I have.''</p>
        <p>The music by younger composers was one casualty of the curtailment of the series for financial reasons. Another was Olivier Messiaen, the most conspicuous absentee among recent composers with whom Mr. Serkin has been most closely associated. He wanted at one stage to include a big Messiaen piece: probably ''From the Canyons to the Stars,'' which he played this summer at the Lincoln Center Festival. But finally, there was no room.</p>
        <p>Any limitation, though, is more than balanced by the opportunity to hear the selected composers in depth. Mr. Wuorinen is represented in three of the four programs, by an orchestral piece, a chamber composition (his Horn Trio) and a set of songs (to words by James Fenton, the librettist of his forthcoming work for the New York City Opera). Mr. Knussen, Mr. Goehr and Mr. Lieberson all appear in two programs each.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to let the audience get familiarized with these composers,'' Mr. Serkin said. ''I hoped people would come and hear one new piece, and be intrigued, and want to hear more. Then the older music fits around the newer, in a way. Stravinsky connects with Charles Wuorinen. Schoenberg and Webern were very important to Alexander Goehr.''</p>
        <p>All four concerts will feature the London Sinfonietta, conducted by Mr. Knussen, a longtime friend and colleague of Mr. Serkin's. The first two programs will occupy the main auditorium at Carnegie Hall and will each include an orchestral piece by Takemitsu and a pair of late Stravinsky works.</p>
        <p>''I remember going to the first New York performances of some of the late Stravinsky pieces, with him conducting,'' Mr. Serkin said, '' 'Threni' in particular. The climaxes and the energy in the rhythm were unforgettable. But still the music hasn't caught on with the public somehow.''</p>
        <p>These performances should help. Mr. Knussen is a marvelous Stravinsky performer, and in ''Movements'' he will be joined by Mr. Serkin at the piano, as in a forthcoming Deutsche Grammophon recording. Also to be heard are the Variations, the compact biblical fable ''The Flood'' and ''Requiem Canticles.''</p>
        <p>All four of these works date from Stravinsky's last creative decade, before he became too ill to compose, at the end of the 1960's. All are brilliant examples of the composer's capacity to learn from much younger composers -- Mr. Boulez, Krzysztof Penderecki -- and still remain, in every fizzing measure, himself. ''Movements'' is a compressed piano concerto bursting with life and invention. ''Requiem Canticles,'' Stravinsky's last major work, is an open stare into the eyes of death.</p>
        <p>The danger might be that these supreme pieces, which seem to become ever more crucial as time goes on, would shrivel any other music of the last 50 years placed near them. But Mr. Serkin appears to have guarded against that in his judicious choices. The two Stravinsky-centered programs will include, besides their delicate Takemitsu works, highly colorful pieces by Mr. Knussen (''The Way to Castle Yonder''), Mr. Wuorinen (his recent ''Symphony Seven'') and Mr. Lieberson (''Red Garuda''). Here, too, will come the taste of Schoenberg: his graphic ''Accompaniment to a Film Scene.''</p>
        <p>''Red Garuda,'' in which a giant bird of Hindu and Buddhist legend is portrayed with flexing metal feathers and a sonorous beating of wings, is the second of Mr. Lieberson's two piano concertos and something like the eighth work he has written for Mr. Serkin, who played it last season at its Boston Symphony premiere and then at the Tanglewood Festival this summer.</p>
        <p>''I like it very much,'' he said. ''Of course, it's entirely different from the first concerto, which was so wonderfully unreasonable. This one is free of frivolous extra decoration, very straightforward, with well-chosen notes.'' Yet the piece is also brilliant and clear, and in those ways not so distant from another picture of a mythic avian, Stravinsky's ''Firebird.''</p>
        <p>The other two concerts will take place in Weill Recital Hall, and here newly commissioned pieces -- by Mr. Goehr and, again, Mr. Lieberson -- will be presented. Both are piano quintets, which Mr. Serkin will play with the Orion String Quartet.</p>
        <p>''The piano quintet is, I think, a wonderful medium but not much used these days,'' he said. ''Alexander Goehr's piece is already written. It's a big work, in three movements, lasting half an hour, and it's extremely clear, lean. It has a lightness that's very rare in the piano quintet. I asked him if I could have it a year ahead, because I wanted to get to know it thoroughly. For me that means, first of all, getting to know the whole piece, approaching it as if I were a composer or a conductor studying it. After that I start to learn my part. Right now I'm looking forward to working on it with the quartet.</p>
        <p>''Of course, there are also times when you have to work more quickly. I remember one time when I was in Tokyo with Oliver Knussen, and he was writing 'Prayer Bell Sketch' for me, faxing it a few measures at a time from his hotel to mine. The ending I got only on the morning of the performance. So that was kind of fun, an adventure. But whether I have a long time to prepare or a little doesn't really matter. The quality of the work is much more important, and I'm just glad these composers can write these pieces at all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Serkin's enthusiasm for his chosen composers is so evident in how he speaks -- just as it is in how he performs -- that the obvious question is whether he has ever composed music himself.</p>
        <p>''Yes, I've tried to put notes and rhythms on paper,'' he said. ''When I was young, I composed quite a bit. My father was very critical. He told me how Schoenberg had said you couldn't compose until you knew all the Haydn quartets. So I got to know all the Haydn quartets. But my love is for music. I love to listen to music, and did from an early age. And at that time I was already studying the piano seriously.''</p>
        <p>So when did he decide he was going to be a concert pianist?</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's happened yet,'' he replied.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile the listening goes on. ''Nowadays I often listen to the radio,'' Mr. Serkin said. ''I like the unexpected. I enjoy listening to recordings of new music, and I've been listening to some older recordings of Otto Klemperer: recordings from the Kroll Opera in 1927, when he has the music on fire. I always loved Klemperer particularly. I heard him rehearse and perform. Just observing him provided great lessons in music.''</p>
        <p>Other musicians he remembers with special intensity include the violinist Alexander Schneider, the flutist Marcel Moyse, the pianist Mieczyslaw Horszowski and the cellist and conductor Pablo Casals, all of whom he heard in his father's company at the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont.</p>
        <p>Relationships with composers he has made for himself.</p>
        <p>''With Toru Takemitsu I had a close friendship,'' he said. ''When I played a piece for him, he didn't make a lot of comments. He seemed curious about what the possibilities might be from a performer's point of view. He was very open-minded. Sometimes he would just sit at the piano and play pop songs, including some with his own texts, but always with that gracefulness of his. I'd got interested in the music of his that was a lot more wild -- pieces like 'Arc,' for piano and orchestra -- but then I started to appreciate the sweetness of his later music, the things that were so fastidiously and beautifully realized.</p>
        <p>''Stefan Wolpe I met at a party after one of Stravinsky's concerts. What he said was very poetic, but he was already ill. I never played for him, though I did play for Irma Wolpe, his second wife, who had some of his manuscripts, often with a lot more indications than there are in the published scores.''</p>
        <p>A fair amount of Wolpe has come out on record lately, but in the concert hall his music is as rare as late Stravinsky. The reasons are undoubtedly similar: the unfamiliarity of the music to performers, and therefore the amount of rehearsal time required. But the vividness locked up in this music is similar, too.</p>
        <p>Mr. Serkin recalled coaching a group at Tanglewood in Wolpe's ''Piece in Two Parts.''  ''We rehearsed for 75 hours,'' he said, ''and then the piece became electric.''</p>
        <p>In his recitals and solo recordings, Mr. Serkin has been a great exponent of both Wolpe and Takemitsu, but in these concerts he will be in his favorite role of listener, hearing Mr. Knussen conduct Takemitsu's ''Green'' and ''How Slow the Wind,'' and hearing the Orion String Quartet and the London Sinfonietta play some of Wolpe's caustic, fantastical chamber pieces.</p>
        <p>''I didn't think it so important that I play all the time,'' he said. ''And I didn't have any specific plan in assembling the programs. I'm not really conceptual. I just tried to think of works that will sound well together.''</p>
