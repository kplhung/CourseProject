        <p>Quest for the Grail</p>
        <p>Q.  For my sister's 30th birthday, I would like to take her on a King Arthur tour of England, since this is one of her interests. Do any tour companies, American or English, offer such a program? -- Amy Hoddick, Pasadena, Calif.</p>
        <p>A.  A number of companies will squire you around southwest England in search of King Arthur, with prices ranging from the princely to the pedestrian.</p>
        <p>Gothic Image Tours are led by  Arthurian scholars. Highlights of the 10-day tour include Arthur's legendary birthplace, Tintagel Castle, on a rocky cliff above the Atlantic; the desolate Dozmary Pool, one of several spots where Arthur is believed to have thrown his sword, Excalibur, to be received by the Lady of the Lake; Stonehenge, said to have been transported by the wizard Merlin from Ireland; the Glastonbury Tor, where legend has it that King Melwas held Queen Guinevere captive until Arthur rescued her; and what is generally agreed to be King Arthur's grave, in Glastonbury. The cost of the trip, which includes lodging in three-star hotels featuring traditional British fare and transportation by minicoach, is $2,150 a person, double occupancy. Call (44-1458) 831281.</p>
        <p>Britannia Tours and Travel offers a three-night package, which includes a stay in the 15th-century George &amp; Pilgrims Inn in Glastonbury (built for pilgrims to Glastonbury Abbey), English breakfasts, and all admissions. The cost of the guided tour with a private car and driver is $995, or $399 for a self-drive car, per person, double occupancy. Highlights include the wind-swept earthworks of Old Sarum in Salisbury, where King Arthur supposedly fought his last battle against the traitorous Mordred, and the Round Table in the Great Hall of Winchester Castle. Information: Britannia Tours and Travel, (800) 220-0658.</p>
        <p>Camelot International will take you on a customized seven-day tour of the counties of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire in pursuit of Arthurian lore for $1,114 a person. The company provides a private car and driver, and lodging and dining in three- and four-star hotels, culminating with a stay at the Camelot Castle hotel in Cornwall. Information: (734) 930-9921 or (800) 201-1598.</p>
        <p>You can follow your own grail with British Footpaths' booklets and workshops. The publishing and workshop company is run by the author Richard Hayward, whose booklet ''Cornwall Coast Path Guide: Land's End to Lizard Point'' ($8.95 plus $1.50 shipping) will guide you through Britain's westernmost point, past one of the 15 or so ''slumber legend'' sites, where Arthur and his knights  are said to sleep until their return. Topics covered in the workshops -- offered in February and April in Seattle, Bellevue and Bellingham, Wash., for under $50 -- include B &amp; B's, pubs, food, living on $35 a day and packing light.

        <p>Christmas in Vienna</p>
        <p>Q.  I am 7 years old. I would like to know what my family and I can do in Vienna during Christmas vacation.  Are there any puppet shows or concerts for children? -- Emma Hitchcock, New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A.  Vienna is a wonderland for children at Christmastime. Beginning Nov. 18, the traditional Christmas market will open in front of the Rathaus, or City Hall, featuring more than 140 booths with presents, games, sweets and pony rides, with a magic lantern show of woodland creatures.</p>
        <p>Events for children will include a Christmas Workshop to be held in the Volkshalle of City Hall, where kids can make their own Christmas presents and bake gingerbread cookies. There will also be a games tent, featuring characters from Austrian children's books and television.</p>
        <p>On the four Sundays before Christmas, choirs from all over the world will sing carols from their homelands under a lighted tree at City Hall. There will also be a life-size Nativity scene, and eight creches from the southern province of Styria.  Another highlight is the mechanical dolls of Vienna Waltz World, an exhibit in City Hall Park, which are based on historical models.</p>
        <p>Trees in City Hall Park will be lighted and trimmed with fantastical decorations, including an all-Santa tree. The Christmas market is a 700-year-old tradition, where candied fruits and hot roasted chestnuts (called maroni in Vienna) are served in small wooden stalls.</p>
        <p>The Magic of Advent 2000, including the market and City Hall events, will be open daily Nov. 18 to Dec. 23, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and until 5 p.m. on Dec. 24. For information, and a brochure, call the Austrian National Tourist Office at (212) 944-6880, or visit www.christkindlmarkt.at.</p>
        <p>Health Coverage Abroad</p>
        <p>Q.  I understand Medicare does not cover injuries or illnesses that are treated outside the United States. What are the insurance choices for someone who travels outside the United States three or four times a year for a month or so at a time?  How do tourists in countries with socialized medicine pay for illnesses that occur and are treated there? -- Rita H. Irons, New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A.</p>
        <p>The original Medicare plan, with a few exceptions, does not cover medical care outside the United States. The exceptions are if the condition occurs within the United States, and the most accessible hospital is across the border with Mexico or Canada, or if you are in direct transit to the continental United States from Alaska.</p>
        <p>Medicare H.M.O.'s do cover emergency procedures abroad, but not routine care. Eight of the ten Medigap policies that are available provide 80 percent of the cost of emergency care during the first two months of a trip outside the country.  The deductible is $250, and the coverage is up to $50,000 in a lifetime. The cost of additional premiums varies from carrier to carrier and state by state. In New York State, monthly premium prices for Medigap plans that cover foreign travel can range from $101.15 to $296, depending on other features of the plan.</p>
        <p>For information, call the consumer group, the Medicare Rights Center, (800) 333-4114, or go to its Web site, www.medicarerights.org. You can also call the New York State Insurance Department at (800) 342-3736 for information about insurance companies and premium prices.</p>
        <p>Countries with socialized medicine, such as those of the United Kingdom, will treat you free in case of an accident or emergency, but will charge for after-care and convalescence.</p>
