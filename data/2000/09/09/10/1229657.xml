        <p>LARS VON TRIER'S ''Dancer in the Dark,'' which opens the New York Film Festival on Sept. 22, is the story of Selma, a factory worker who is losing her sight. Played by the Icelandic pop singer Bjork, Selma escapes her life of drudgery with fantasies that place her at the center of an idiosyncratic movie musical. In the conversation that follows, the critic Dave Kehr, who writes the At the Movies column for The New York Times and was a member of the New York Film Festival selection committee, talks with Mr. von Trier about the form and function of the musical and how ''Dancer in the Dark'' confronts that tradition.</p>
        <p>DAVE KEHR.  I suppose the basic question is why does Lars von Trier, who is most famous right now for founding the Dogma 95 movement, which tries to drive a sense of artifice out of the movies, want to make a musical?</p>
        <p>LARS VON TRIER.  I was always very fascinated by musicals; they say security to me. It was good as a child to sit down and see a musical, because you knew that no harm would come to you or anybody in the film. I remember particularly ''Singin' in the Rain.'' That was my favorite musical for many years.</p>
        <p>KEHR.  And that's also a movie about people who are creating their own world, in a way, much as Selma does in ''Dancer in the Dark.'' It's almost Selma who's directing the musical numbers, rather than you.</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  That was the idea, yes. It should come from her, yeah.</p>
        <p>KEHR.  How is her view of the world expressed through those numbers?</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  My idea was that she should be somebody very fond of the human element. That means, you know, little mistakes. Any sound that comes from human beings or machines could start the music for her and trigger these fantasies.</p>
        <p>KEHR.  So she remains very much rooted in reality at the same time that she's trying to transcend it.</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  She's actually using these fantasies to change perspective a little bit -- but she's still looking at her own reality.</p>
        <p>KEHR.  When you begin with the number from ''The Sound of Music,'' what are you trying to establish?</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  First of all, contact to the older musicals. And to humanize the musicals, in the sense that they are done in a very sloppy and amateur way.</p>
        <p>KEHR.  It's incredibly endearing, that scene. And particularly when she's working with Catherine Deneuve, who, of course, is associated with the other great director of realistic musicals, Jacques Demy.</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  Oh yes, yes.</p>
        <p>KEHR.  How do you think Bjork relates to the musical stars of the past -- next to, say, Julie Andrews?</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  Well, I know that she saw ''The Sound of Music'' several times, because, you know, in Iceland there weren't that many films. And I think that her parents dragged her to see it so many times that she was sick of it. That was what was interesting about the script for her; there were a lot of parallels to her own situation. And one of them was her knowledge about -- too much knowledge about -- ''Sound of Music.''</p>
        <p>KEHR.  What other parallels are there?</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  Well, the fact that Bjork also worked in a factory and was listening to machines and making it into music. And also that she had a son of the same age. I just read that she felt it was written about her -- which it might have been, but not on a conscious level, because I didn't know about her when I wrote it.</p>
        <p>KEHR.  Could you tell me some more about what musicals meant to you when you were growing up -- that sense of security you were talking about?</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  Yeah, maybe it has to do with a system. A musical is very systematic, much more systematic than normal film, so it's much easier to, well, read patterns. At this point there comes a song, then this happens, blah, blah, blah. It became almost mathematics to me. And I think that was part of why it felt so secure: there were no surprises.</p>
        <p>KEHR.  And one of the things you want to do is return a sense of surprise?</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  Well, I would say my interest at this point in my life was in melodrama, which I was forbidden in my childhood, so, of course, when I was grown up I had to drag myself into it or jump into it. What I tried to do was combine these things, the melodrama and the musical, to put back some emotions. To see if it was possible to use the strength of music and singing -- which is a powerful tool emotionally, but not in film -- to see if you could use it to get this power out. Because musicals have always been like an operetta -- not heavy emotions. So this may be a little closer to an opera, in the sense that opera and melodrama have always been closely connected.</p>
        <p>KEHR.  The theme of the blindness, of course, is a key element in the melodrama tradition.</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  Yes, yes, but that came in later. Actually, I wrote the first script without the blindness. And then I saw a little cartoon, about a blind girl in New York, very touching. I said, ''Why did I forget about that?'' And straightaway thought of ''Magnificent Obsession.'' Douglas Sirk had a Danish mother, so he's kind of half Danish. That's where it came from -- all culture, you know, comes from Denmark. That's why you call it a Danish. I think it's kind of the same quality that you find in a Danish pastry --</p>
        <p>KEHR.  Sweetness and texture, I think.</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  Yes, with no vitamins whatsoever.</p>
        <p>KEHR.  Some people think you're just a total cynic when you make a musical like this, but you're not making fun of these people's emotions.</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  I'm trying my best not to, but in my private life I have a lot of humor, or I think I have. But cynical, yeah, maybe, that I don't know. I feel with the characters when I do the films. So I wouldn't say that I'm cynical about it. It was a painful thing for me to do this film, as it was for Bjork. I think that a real cynic almost has a pleasure out of it.</p>
        <p>KEHR.  Is this something you'd like to try again? Are you interested in making another musical?</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  No. Yeah. Maybe. We still have some intentions that we haven't fulfilled. Maybe one day, I don't know.</p>
        <p>KEHR.  Which intentions?</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  About this musical form. I think it would be very interesting if you could establish a film form that covered the area of opera -- where you have the strong tool of the music and the song, and use it with a story that you accept. I'm not very proud that the music bits are fantasies. I would love to see a much more abstract film, like the French ones that Catherine Deneuve was in. It's a very clear form, and if you could really establish this in the audience, I think we would have something that would be interesting and that doesn't exist today.</p>
        <p>KEHR.  I thought a bit of ''West Side Story.''</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  Yes. As a matter of fact, ''West Side Story'' is the closest you get, but that is also melodramatic. And that is close also to an opera. I like it very much, think it's a beautiful film. I was shocked when I heard that it's Robert Wise, the same director who did ''Sound of Music.'' I don't think ''Sound of Music'' is a very good film, I must say; I think it's a good score. But ''West Side Story'' is a very good film.</p>
        <p>KEHR.  And created by people who knew the classical opera tradition. So it's not really a pop musical -- --</p>
        <p>VON TRIER.  No, and I like that. Even though I also like to laugh, I like things to be serious. It's good.</p>
