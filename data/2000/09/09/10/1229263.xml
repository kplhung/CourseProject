        <p>Peggy Jones was taking her usual route down Lincoln Avenue in this small Camden County borough when she suddenly bolted upright and spilled her coffee.</p>
        <p>''Now, I've seen yellow, but that is yellow,'' said Ms. Jones, pointing at the new diamond-shaped crossing signs in front of Central Elementary School. ''Got to give them credit. I certainly noticed them.''</p>
        <p>As towns all over the state prepared for the school year over the last several days, scores of school and pedestrian crossing signs were changed from the old drab school-bus yellow background to a new color called either fluorescent yellow-green or strong yellow-green.</p>
        <p>The new color, the state assures, has better reflective qualities, especially at dawn and dusk as well as when car lights shine on it, and traffic-safety experts have been encouraging its use. The strong yellow-green signs started replacing the old ones in the spring in some parts of the state.</p>
        <p>''Engineers like to have something quantitative, and we don't have that,'' said Bill Anderson, manager of the Bureau of Traffic Engineering in the New Jersey Department of Transportation. ''But I myself react to it.  And you have to say that as long as people are talking about the signs, they must be calling attention to the crossings, which is a big part of the battle.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, erecting the new signs is a local option, not a requirement. There are four classes of roads in New Jersey -- federal, state, county and local municipal -- and each makes its own rules on highway signs, though they generally cleave to a book by the Federal Highway Administration, ''The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.'' In cat, it was the June 1998 version of the manual that first allowed the use of strong yellow-green signs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson said Burlington County had already upgraded the school crossing signs on all county roads adjacent to schools. But he said it was more likely that as towns got ready to retire their older signs, they would  turn to the new fluorescent ones.</p>
        <p>''The sheeting and the coloring are made to react to ultra-violet light, where the old signs didn't,'' said Mr. Anderson. On a sunny day, they both show up equally well. But when it is cloudy, or at dawn or dusk, the ultraviolet light still comes through even though the sunlight is diminished. ''It's like when it is a cloudy day and you still get sun-burned, well, that is the ultraviolet light.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson said that in the mid-1990's the state started using more fluorescent orange on road construction signs, which he considered a good safety move. But there are no other plans to change the coloring, for instance, for stop signs or speed-limit signs. On the signs near the Haddonfield Central School, though, the borough has put strong yellow-green reflective strips on poles of the pedestrian signs and a red reflective strip on the pole of a nearby stop sign.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure that that isn't counterproductive,'' said Mr. Anderson. ''Some companies must be doing a good job marketing reflective strips. I think that when you try to call attention to everything, you get diminishing returns. Everything seems to be in the same barrel that way. But I understand the motivation, which is safety.''</p>
        <p>But Chief Rick Tsonias of the Haddonfield Police Department is enthusiastic about his town s new double-reflective signs.</p>
        <p>''The extra cost certainly outweighs the benefits, and that is why we put in the channel stripping along the poles,'' said Chief Tsonias, adding that it meant only another $15 or so a pole. ''Anything that helps preserve the safety of, especially, school kids is just not overkill.''</p>
        <p>Since the the cost of replacing signs is relatively small -- a little more than $100 each -- the changes should occur fairly rapidly in the coming months. Except, interestingly enough, on the state roads overseen by Mr. Anderson.</p>
        <p>''We had just replaced all the yellow signs on our state roads when this rule got changed,'' he said. ''The sheeting manufacturers give us a 10-year warranty, so we are not in a position right now to go changing them.''</p>
