        <p>INNOCENCE</p>
        <p>By Jane Mendelsohn.</p>
        <p>199 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Riverhead Books. $21.95.</p>
        <p>The book sits in my hands. It is the second book the author has written. Every word is serious. The declarative sentences pile one on top of another. They carry their solemn freight and pass it on. The book must be read quickly. It will vanish if you do not read it quickly. Vanish like bats in the inky night. . . .</p>
        <p>Sorry, there's just something about Jane Mendelsohn's style that works its way into your system. How you regard this invasion probably depends on how you felt about her last novel, ''I Was Amelia Earhart.'' For her fans, it was a rhapsodic meditation on the fate of America's most famous aviatrix. For people like me, it was a quick but suffocating climb into the ether of literary sensibility. In fact, it was nothing but sensibility: a cloud of affect.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the mannered, self-dramatizing prose in which Mendelsohn specializes turns out to be appropriate for the mannered, self-dramatizing heroine of her new book, ''Innocence.'' Beckett Warner is a motherless teenage girl, enrolled in an exclusive private school in Manhattan and reduced to gazing forlornly at the school's beautiful girls, ''mermaids'' who lord it over her with hair that ''swung down like rope.'' She holds little hope of joining them: ''I'm the ugly girl, the smart girl, the boyish girl, the loser. I'm the one who knows too much.''</p>
        <p>Knows too much, indeed. When her father falls under the spell of the school nurse -- a red-haired, green-eyed cupcake named Pamela -- Beckett's the only one who senses something a little peculiar about the woman who will become her new stepmom. What tips her off? Well, there's the ''placid dead look'' that comes into Pamela's eyes at certain moments. And there's the small matter of Pamela's book club, whose members are surprisingly unanimous about what they like. That would be blood. Specifically, the blood of unspoiled pubescent girls.</p>
        <p>First to go are a trio of high school beauties named Sunday, Morgan and Myrrh. (Frankincense, presumably, transferred out in time.) And although Beckett can't get anyone to believe her, she has a queasy feeling that she's next on the list. For one thing, her used tampons keep disappearing. And then, just as she's on the verge of losing her virginity, her boyfriend, Tobey, gets beaten into a coma. And, scariest of all, Beckett's looks are taking a startling turn for the better. She's becoming a raving beauty, and it gives her the disquieting sense of being fattened for a kill.</p>
        <p>''Innocence'' plays out its brief span in the spectral cobblestone streets of Manhattan, where Beckett can hear ''voices from a hundred years ago calling my name.'' This is ghost-town Gotham, where every sidewalk is steeped in nightshade and mystery, but perhaps the deepest mystery ''Innocence'' offers is this: Why would a pedigreed writer like Jane Mendelsohn churn out such an arrant potboiler? Or, put another way: Why would Amelia Earhart's spiritual executor write a script treatment for ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''?</p>
        <p>Actually, with its umbrella-wielding ghouls and its supernatural Internet visitors and its closing homage to ''The Wizard of Oz,'' ''Innocence'' is a little corny by ''Buffy'' standards and nowhere near as witty. And Mendelsohn seems as embarrassed as anyone, judging by the layers of literary enamel she has flung at her own story. Teasing references to unreliable narrators. Jarring shifts in tense (a stylistic tic left over from her last novel). Invocations of Persephone and Lolita. Fugal variations on ketchup and bats and butterflies. She works hard -- very hard -- to conceal the pulpishness of her material, and at first you kind of feel for her, and then, after about 100 pages of lyrical strophes, you're ready to scream: ''Hey! You're writing about lady vampires who feast on virgins' menstrual blood!''</p>
        <p>Maybe Mendelsohn thinks she's single-handedly elevating the genre -- dragging it from the vale of Ira Levin to a more empyreal Joyce Carol Oates realm. But what she's really doing is draining it of its tawdry pleasures, sealing it inside the shellacked tomb of her prose. And unlike the hack writers who have been spinning out these yarns for decades, Mendelsohn can't even make us fear for her characters' lives because she hasn't given them any life to lose. Long before any vampires could reach them, they've been sucked dry by her aestheticizing impulse.</p>
