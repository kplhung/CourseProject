        <p>In a city blessed with a gorgeous landscape and climate, much of life is lived out of doors, and in Rio de Janeiro, no setting brings more people together than the botequims. These open-air neighborhood bars are so much a part of the city's fabric that the mayor's office sponsors a hotly disputed annual competition to designate the best one, in which hundreds of saloons, from the humble to the elaborate, take part.</p>
        <p>For the past three years, the hands-down winner has been the Bar Bracarense, at 85 Rua Jose Linhares in the Leblon neighborhood, two blocks from the beach. Historically, Leblon has had a reputation as a haven for bohemian types, and Bracarense has been one of their favorite bars for nearly a half-century. On warm summer weekends, they are joined by beachgoers returning from a day in the sun and yearning for a ''stupidly chilled'' beer.</p>

        <p>In a city blessed with a gorgeous landscape and climate, much of life is lived out of doors, and in Rio de Janeiro, no setting brings more people together than the botequims. These open-air neighborhood bars are so much a part of the city's fabric that the mayor's office sponsors a hotly disputed annual competition to designate the best one, in which hundreds of saloons, from the humble to the elaborate, take part.</p>
        <p>For the past three years, the hands-down winner has been the Bar Bracarense, at 85 Rua Jose Linhares in the Leblon neighborhood, two blocks from the beach. Historically, Leblon has had a reputation as a haven for bohemian types, and Bracarense has been one of their favorite bars for nearly a half-century. On warm summer weekends, they are joined by beachgoers returning from a day in the sun and yearning for a ''stupidly chilled'' beer.</p>
        <p>Bracarense is in no way imposing. Its appeal is that it is almost the archetype of the Brazilian botequim, casual and relaxed. Inside are eight wooden bar stools where one can sit to study the drinks list posted on the wall. But most clients prefer to sit at the dozen or so white plastic tables set up on the sidewalk and gab about soccer, politics and music as they imbibe.</p>
        <p>Like most of Rio's botequims, Bracarense does not offer drinks that can be considered exotic or especially sophisticated. Draft beer, known as chopp, is the choice of most patrons, along with such typically Brazilian drinks as the caipirinha, made from 100-proof sugar-cane liquor with infusions of tropical fruit juices, but whiskey and vodka are also available.</p>
        <p>And just as Spanish bars have tapas, a Brazilian bar always offers some sort of signature snack, known as a petisco or tira-gosto, to clear the palate between rounds. Among connoisseurs, Bracarense is famous for two: codfish balls, and a salty manioc, cheese and shrimp patty that seems designed to make customers holler, ''Waiter, another chopp over here, please.''</p>
