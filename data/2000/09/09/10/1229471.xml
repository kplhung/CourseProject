        <p>For his final months in office, President Clinton will remain enmeshed in a battle over his license to practice law that friends and associates say has left him especially angry and dispirited.</p>
        <p>The disbarment trial will take place in Little Rock, Ark., possibly  this fall, and has several elements that friends said have deeply troubled Mr. Clinton. One of the president's concerns, they said, is that disbarment would be both a lifetime stigma and a definitive verdict for history. It would also be the result of a proceeding difficult to portray as a groundless and partisan vendetta, which is how the president and his allies characterized the investigation by Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, and the ensuing impeachment fight in Congress.</p>
        <p>In addition, the issue will be fought in Arkansas, his home state, making it even more hurtful, the friends said.</p>
        <p>One longtime friend of the president said Mr. Clinton was ''livid, off-the-wall angry'' about the disbarment proceedings. On more than one occasion, the president would be ''in a terrific mood'' until the disbarment issue came up, the friend said. ''His mood immediately darkens,'' said the friend, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, this friend said, is especially concerned that if he is disbarred, he will go down as the first president in American history to lose his law license while in office, a punishment that was not even visited upon Richard M. Nixon, who surrendered his license after he left the White House.</p>
        <p>Another longtime Washington associate who spoke only on the condition of anonymity said that the president's pointed unhappiness over the disbarment case also reflected a kind of weariness and annoyance that his acquittal last year in the Senate impeachment trial did not end the grind of formal legal proceedings. ''He thought, well, we all thought, this thing was over with,'' this person said.</p>
        <p>Two associates said that President Clinton was so stunned on the afternoon of May 22 when he learned that an Arkansas bar committee formed by the state Supreme Court had recommended his disbarment that he responded by likening the recommendation to the imposition of the death sentence for a minor crime.</p>
        <p>When asked to comment on how the president was reacting to the disbarment case, the White House provided a statement from John D. Podesta, the chief of staff, that said the president was ''focused first on doing his job and what he can get done in the next several months and on making sure the Democratic campaigns are successful in the fall.''</p>
        <p>''The other matter he is leaving to his lawyers where it belongs,'' the statement said.</p>
        <p>It remains unclear if Mr. Clinton will have to testify in his own behalf or will want to do so. Either way, the proceedings in the case, Neal v. Clinton, may be televised from the Pulaski County Courthouse in Little Rock. And they will most likely take place while Mr. Clinton is still in office, making it especially uncomfortable for him, one of the friends said.</p>
        <p>Skip Rutherford, a longtime friend from Little Rock who is heading the committee that is soliciting money for and overseeing the construction of the Clinton Library in the east end of town, raised the possibility this summer that the president might choose to move the library elsewhere out of disgust with what is happening to him in his home state.</p>
        <p>''Some of us are asking, and we think he should be asking, whether it's worth it to bring this project here,'' Mr. Rutherford had said in an interview. Mr. Rutherford, who speaks often with Mr. Clinton, said that it seemed awful to many of the president's supporters that he was  being treated this way in Arkansas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rutherford said that the library could be built at Georgetown University in Washington, where Mr. Clinton was an undergraduate.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Rutherford's comments, it is highly unlikely that plans to build the Clinton Library in Little Rock will change. This summer, during the Democratic National Convention, the president raised at least $10 million at a Los Angeles reception for the library and he recently told interviewers that after he left office he expected to spend about two days a week in Arkansas.</p>
        <p>The disbarment proceedings might also influence whether the president faces other legal problems after he leaves office. Some legal analysts have said Robert W. Ray, who succeeded Mr. Starr, might be less inclined to indict Mr. Clinton on perjury charges if he has already been punished through disbarment or by having his law license suspended. Mr. Ray has impaneled a new federal grand jury in Washington to consider whether Mr. Clinton should be prosecuted for lying in the Paula Jones case, which was also a subject of his impeachment trial.</p>
        <p>Two complaints triggered the Arkansas disbarment proceedings, one filed by a conservative legal group and the other by Susan Webber Wright, the federal judge who presided over Ms. Jones's sexual misconduct lawsuit against Mr. Clinton. In a January 1998 deposition in that case, Mr. Clinton testified under oath in Judge Wright's presence that he had not engaged in a sexual relationship with a White House intern.</p>
        <p>In August 1998, Mr. Clinton acknowledged an inappropriate intimate relationship with the intern but maintained that he had told the truth in the deposition.</p>
        <p>Judge Wright disagreed, fining him $90,000 for contempt and referring the matter to the Arkansas bar.</p>
        <p>The bar committee recommended the disbarment, rejecting lesser sanctions of a suspension of his license or a reprimand, a penalty that Mr. Clinton had suggested he might have accepted.</p>
        <p>Among the legal issues that may come up in the hearing is Mr. Clinton's decision not to contest Judge Wright's contempt finding.</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Clinton did not mount a challenge, it is unclear whether he is now barred, or as lawyers would say, ''estopped,'' from repeating his argument that he did not lie.</p>
        <p>Prof. Howard Brill of the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville said that the judge hearing the case might well rule that Mr. Clinton, in essence, waived his right to raise the issue.</p>
        <p>The other major issue in the case will be an argument over the severity of the punishment. In papers filed in Arkansas on Aug. 29, President Clinton's lawyers said that even if what the bar committee had accused him of was true, disbarment was far too harsh and was disproportionate to the punishment the state had meted out to other lawyers.</p>
        <p>''A sanction of disbarment would be excessively harsh, impermissibly punitive and unprecedented in the circumstances of this case,'' wrote the lawyers, David E. Kendall and Nicole K. Seligman of Washington.</p>
        <p>The lawyers also suggested in the papers that Mr. Clinton had not waived his argument that he did not technically lie.</p>
        <p>The Arkansas bar committee disciplines about 100 lawyers each year and disbarment is used almost solely in cases involving the theft of client money. Although most of the precedent is on the president's side, there are other considerations that could influence the judge hearing the case.</p>
        <p>Using a recently revised judicial ethics code, the state Supreme Court upheld the disbarment of a lawyer in 1998 who committed insurance fraud, saying, ''There is simply no place in the law for a man or woman who will not tell the truth even when his interest is involved.''</p>
        <p>Another issue is whether lawyers who hold public office like Mr. Clinton bear a greater ethical burden than lawyers who do not. The commentaries to the code under which Mr. Clinton is charged hold that ''lawyers holding public office assume legal responsibilities going beyond those of other citizens.''</p>
        <p>The case for disbarment will be argued by a former nun, Marie-Bernarde Miller. Judge Leon Johnson agreed to preside over the case after several other judges on the Circuit Court recused themselves because they have been active in Arkansas politics.</p>
