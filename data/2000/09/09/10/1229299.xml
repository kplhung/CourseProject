        <p>The twang of country music guitars, not the crack of the bat, will be heard at the Sandcastle Stadium in Atlantic City next Saturday as the country band, Alabama, takes the stage to headline the first of two days of the Big Bang Concert Series.</p>
        <p>The second day of the festival on Sunday will feature pop music led by Mandy Moore and other popular acts.</p>
        <p>The two days of music and games will benefit several state and local charities and is being sponsored by the Sands Casino Hotel and AtlanticPacific Music.</p>
        <p>It is the first time an Atlantic City casino has sponsored a major charity event at a site outside of a casino, said Al Luciani, president of the Sands. It also is the first such use of the 5,836-seat Sandcastle Stadium, which was built two years ago for minor league baseball.</p>
        <p>In addition to the band Alabama, which has been making country music for more than 20 years, the Grand Slam Country Jam on Saturday will include Mark Wills, The Kinleys, and Darryl Worley. Proceeds will go to the New Jersey Red Cross Chapter Disaster Relief, which provides assistance to victims of hurricanes and other disasters.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Mandy Moore will be joined on the diamond by Vitamin C, whose current hit ''Graduation'' became a theme song for teenagers this summer, and Baha Men, whose current hit ''Who Let the Dogs Out?'' was No. 1 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart.</p>
        <p>The festival also will include amusement rides, sports challenges, dunking tanks and other carnival-style activities. Proceeds will go to several Atlantic City charities dedicated to helping children.</p>
        <p>Tickets for both days are available at Ticketmaster, at the Sands box office or at the Sandcastle box office.</p>
