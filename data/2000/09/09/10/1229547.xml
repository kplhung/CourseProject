        <p>The Russian word for ''bar'' is ''bar.'' That should suggest how foreign the concept initially was. Choosing Moscow's best bar is like choosing Russia's best 10-year-old physicist. They're there. Just give them time to grow up.</p>
        <p>That said, Moscow has some good bars. There's the elegant bar at the Metropole, perhaps the city's swankiest hotel, hard against the Kremlin, and the Kitaisky Lyotchik, or Chinese Pilot, a relaxed, neighborhood kind of place where one can catch live music at night and break-fast in the morning. And there's the bar at the Zolotoe Koltso, a hotel opposite the soaring Stalinesque foreign ministry headquarters, where the view from 22 stories makes up for the lack of decor.</p>

        <p>The Russian word for ''bar'' is ''bar.'' That should suggest how foreign the concept initially was. Choosing Moscow's best bar is like choosing Russia's best 10-year-old physicist. They're there. Just give them time to grow up.</p>
        <p>That said, Moscow has some good bars. There's the elegant bar at the Metropole, perhaps the city's swankiest hotel, hard against the Kremlin, and the Kitaisky Lyotchik, or Chinese Pilot, a relaxed, neighborhood kind of place where one can catch live music at night and break-fast in the morning. And there's the bar at the Zolotoe Koltso, a hotel opposite the soaring Stalinesque foreign ministry headquarters, where the view from 22 stories makes up for the lack of decor.</p>
        <p>The watering hole of the moment, however, is Justo, not far across the Moscow River from the Kremlin on Tolmachevsky Pereulok, one of the city's more European streets.</p>
        <p>A private club until last November, Justo is now open to anyone, as long as he or she is sufficiently hip: admittance requires ringing a doorbell and passing the bouncer's scrutiny. ''You have to ring the bell to get into the finest homes,'' says Ruslan Tarkinsky, the 32-year-old, very hip, buzz-cut manager.</p>
        <p>If it sounds contrived, it is. But the bar itself turns out to be a friendly sort of place in which suits and the black-turtleneck crowd coexist with a minimum of discomfort.</p>
        <p>Within the gate is a courtyard nightclub, beneath a soaring khaki-colored canopy. Inside, down the stairs, is an intimate saloon-cum-disco-cum-restaurant, with a semicircular chrome bar as a hub for distinctive smaller rooms, populated with comfortable sofas and natural wood tables. The decor is stark gray: black-and-white photos projected on gray concrete walls and gray sheets of linen, and a screen for silent movies (black-and-white, of course). One nice touch of color: the glass-walled coatroom features glowing fluorescent coat checks.</p>
        <p>The house merlot is $6 a glass, and the beers -- Kirin and Sapporo in bottles, Heineken and Grolsch on tap -- are cheaper than in New York. The liquor list is not long, but the major brands are there, in both Russian and charmingly misspelled English.</p>
        <p>Moscow's best bar? Justo is certainly a contender. But for coolness, nobody else is close.</p>
