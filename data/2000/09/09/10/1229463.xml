        <p>The bottles of wine, about 2,000 of them, are in storage somewhere in a New Jersey warehouse. Glenn Parker just bought a house in Somerset County, N.J., and is awaiting their delivery before he invites his new co-workers over to sample his cooking and an evening of wine-tasting. He is considering making ''Monday Night Football'' the backdrop.</p>
        <p>Parker is not a well-heeled socialite looking to impress. He is merely one of three new starters on the Giants' rebuilt offensive line, and he has a knowledge of wine and a knack for promoting team harmony.</p>
        <p>''I just wanted to make sure they felt good about us coming in, that they didn't think we were jerks, that we were just guys like they are, that we were just brought in to do a job,'' Parker said.</p>
        <p>Parker makes himself and his fellow newcomers, Lomas Brown and Dusty Zeigler, sound like mercenaries. And of all the changes the Giants made during the off-season, none was bigger and more of a gamble than revamping the line. It struggled through a penalty- and sack-filled season in 1999 and needed to be reassembled to protect Kerry Collins and unleash a new rushing attack.</p>
        <p>But linemen need to work in unison, and the Giants took a risk with the overhaul. Brown concedes that the Eagles, the Giants' opponent today in Philadelphia, will be a stronger test than the Arizona Cardinals were last Sunday in the opener.</p>
        <p>''I think the book is still open on us,'' he said. ''People still don't know how good we're going to be.''</p>
        <p>With one player back at his 1999 position, the line performed flawlessly last week. It held the Cardinals without a sack and committed one penalty in a 21-16 victory as the Giants rushed for 223 yards. For one game, it was a relief from last year's 88.3-yard rushing average, the team's worst since 1953.</p>
        <p>Every unit of a team tends to form its own clique, wide receivers socializing with wide receivers and so on. But no part needs to work together more than an offensive line, where a mistake can mean a quarterback injury or the difference between the playoffs and a losing record.</p>
        <p>Their interaction will be tested today in Veterans Stadium's harsh atmosphere. To prepare, Coach Jim Fassel had two huge black speakers on the practice sidelines last week delivering ''crowd noise,'' although it sounded more like jets. That forced the offense, and especially the line, to rely on gestures instead of words. Zeigler called it the ''point and nod.''</p>
        <p>Parker realized he was entering an awkward situation with bruised egos and perhaps some hard feelings when he came to the Giants. Right guard Ron Stone is the only player who remained at his position. Luke Petitgout had been switched from left guard to the right side. Center Brian Williams, right tackle Scott Gragg and left tackle Roman Oben are all gone.</p>
        <p>Parker, who played in four Super Bowls with the Buffalo Bills, became the left guard after leaving Kansas City. Brown, a seven-time Pro Bowl selection who is in his 16th year, left Cleveland to become the left tackle. Zeigler, a free agent from Dallas, replaced Williams at center. The new quintet tried little ways to bring themselves together. They had group lunches. In training camp, when they went to an Albany restaurant, and Parker selected the wines. On Thursdays, they try to meet for dinner.</p>
        <p>''I think it makes people more comfortable with each other,'' Zeig ler said. ''Once you know what kind of person they are, you expect certain things from them.''</p>
        <p>Zeigler is a part owner of a company that rents bulldozers. Parker, of course, knows his wines. He interned at the Robert Mondavi Winery in California last year. Brown claims to have seen almost every American horror movie ever made and owns about 200 on videotape or DVD. Brown is as discriminating about his films as Parker is about wine. His favorites include classics like ''The Omen'' and ''The Exorcist'' and the more contemporary ''Hellraiser'' series.</p>
        <p>''I don't like my horror mixed with comedy,'' Brown said. '' 'Scream' is good because it has a good plot mixed in with it.''</p>
        <p>Brown might have gotten a kick last season from watching the horror of the Giants' line, which seemed to produce as many penalties as blocks. The Giants showed last week that they can run, but the Eagles blitz from all directions. Last Sunday, they sacked Cowboys quarterbacks five times and gave Troy Aikman a concussion.</p>
        <p>Eagles linebacker Jeremiah Trotter said they would try to rattle Collins.</p>
        <p>Fassel conceded that the Eagles would make their share of plays today but said he would be shocked if the Giants did not handle the pressure, because ''the maturity level we have on offense is light years different than we've had in the past.''</p>
        <p>No one is saying this group will glide through the season. At 37, Brown is a year older than the offensive coordinator, Sean Payton. Brown missed last season's final six games because of an injury. Parker, 34, wears a brace on his left elbow from a sprain last season.</p>
        <p>Fassel, who has not had a good offensive line since 1997, cites experience and attitude as reasons for the turnaround.</p>
        <p>He sees a swagger on the field that had been missing. During drills against the defense, the line no longer looks meek and submits to the defense's tauntings. After a few more solid games, they can toast their accomplishments.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Giants yesterday deactivated tight end PETE MITCHELL, who has not played since spraining his left knee in the first preseason game. Tight end BRODY HEFFNER-LIDDIARD was activated from the practice squad to fill Mitchell's role as the emergency long snapper. Cornerback RAMOS McDONALD was waived for the second time in less than two weeks.</p>
