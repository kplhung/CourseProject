        <p>THE HEAD GAME</p>
        <p>Baseball Seen</p>
        <p>From the Pitcher's Mound.</p>
        <p>By Roger Kahn.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 308 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Harcourt. $25.</p>
        <p>IF artists could find work in the perspiratory world of professional sports, they would do so on the pitcher's mound. One hundred brushstrokes from a palette of fastballs and change-ups and curves, thrown at different speeds and with the hurler painting the corners, forms a masterpiece. Such an outlook requires a little exaggeration -- dreamy hyperbole from a viewer utterly hypnotized by baseball. There is no better place to find that than in ''The Head Game,'' in which Roger Kahn, the rhapsodic author of ''The Boys of Summer,'' spends 300 pages bowing at the altar of some 150 years of pitching gods. Unfortunately, Kahn spends so much time swooning at what these men did that he veers away from the promise of his book, which is to explore and explain the beauty of how they did it.</p>
        <p>''The Head Game'' is unquestionably valuable as a tour of some of baseball's greatest pitchers. First we meet Charles Radbourn, the hard-drinking right-hander known as Old Hoss, who typified 19th-century hurlers by starting 68 games in one season, completing 66 of them and winning 49. Christy Mathewson, the genteel New York Giant who won 20 games for 12 straight seasons, gained his everlasting fame by throwing three shutouts in the 1905 World Series. Interviews with Warren Spahn, Johnny Sain, Don Drysdale, Bruce Sutter and others constitute other chapters, each painting a detailed portrait of a top pitcher. Spahn, the great Milwaukee Braves' left-hander who pitched well into his 40's, discusses how he learned from hitters as he got older: ''How did they tell me my fastball was losing zip? They began hitting it.'' The other half of the Braves' vaunted ''Spahn and Sain and pray for rain'' duo speaks of changing speeds within his pitch patterns and tells how he later taught that to others as one of the best pitching coaches the game has ever known. Drysdale thrived by brazenly throwing at batters' heads, while Sutter's split-finger fastball devilishly dropped out of the strike zone just as the helpless hitters swung.</p>
        <p>The book's heartbeat resides in Kahn's description of the evolution from throwing to pitching. Early baseball rules called for the ball to be tossed underhanded so that the batter could easily hit it, reducing the pitcher to something ''akin to the tee in golf.'' (With today's incredible shrinking strike zone, history clearly has repeated itself.) In 1884 all such restrictions were lifted, allowing for overhand pitches, breaking balls and the resulting battle of wits between pitcher and hitter. ''Years of trial and error,'' Kahn writes, ''went into making the head game both interesting and reasonably fair.'' Mathewson was perhaps the first to master this relationship. ''You want to surprise hitters,'' he once said. ''If a pitcher displays his whole assortment early in the game, uses all his speed and his sharpest breaking curves, then when the crisis comes he, rather than the hitters, will end up with surprises, mostly unpleasant.''</p>
        <p>Kahn states that ''the battle itself, the head game, is a duel,'' but he too rarely expounds on its strategies and tactics, instead spinning off into indulgent and downright bizarre digressions. He injects himself into too many anecdotes -- As I learned on sandlots'' -- and his elegiac prattle about his beloved Brooklyn Dodgers is maddeningly distracting. His asides occasionally thrill, like when we learn how the Giants' manager John McGraw put soap shavings in the dirt on the pitcher's mound to make opponents' hands slippery, but that sensation gets deadened by, among other things, discussions of Jesse James's death and the 1884 presidential race.</p>
        <p>By focusing almost entirely on pitchers from the 1960's and before, Kahn misses a chance to offer a comprehensive depiction of pitching today and where it is headed. A book on pitching without mention of the incomparable Boston Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez brands itself immediately as out of date. Had Kahn examined a dozen more pitchers from all eras, he would have given a fuller picture of the art's appeal.</p>
        <p>''The Head Game'' is one long at-bat, Kahn throwing his pitches in and out, up and down. Like many of the pitchers he cites, he loses control in ways that make one wonder what might have been.</p>
