        <p>CURTAINS will rise and fall this season. There will be new shows and new stars. Old reputations will be polished. But one thing will remain constant: Backstage, on any given night, a stage manager will be calling a quiet ''Places.''</p>
        <p>Their names are almost never known, though the show cannot go on without them. But a group of dancers and a lighting designer will do something about that with ''A Party for Max!,'' a salute to the stage manager Maxine Glorsky, on Wednesday night at the Joyce Theater. The program will celebrate Ms. Glorsky's 60th birthday, and her more than four decades in dance, with performances by some of her favorite companies, the screening of a video mini-documentary and onstage reminiscences by colleagues.</p>
        <p>''Max is absolutely a center of calm in a sea of frenzy,'' the choreographer Lar Lubovitch, a longtime client, said. ''She knows the sort of neurotic energy it takes to get something on the stage, and she deals with it like a master psychologist. She has hand-walked a great number of very well-known people to the stage to allow them to deliver their superb performances.''</p>
        <p>What does a stage manager do? First comes working out a schedule with the theater and the crew. The stage manager and support team set up about 12 hours before a dance company's warm-up for rehearsal. The lights are focused and the scenery placed on the stage and then, on the day of the performance, the light and sound cues are set and the performers work out spacing problems in a run-through. ''Flamencos,'' Ms. Glorsky said, tend not to like rehearsing on the day of the show. ''They want to be spontaneous and rested. Ballet and modern-dance people like to warm up for long periods of time.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Glorsky has worked with a roster of artists and companies that reads like a history of American dance since the 1960's, among them Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham, Rudolf Nureyev, Glen Tetley, Lar Lubovitch, the Harkness Ballet, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens and Mikhail Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance Project. Many of her clients have been struggling young independents who know that she will fight for them like a lioness for her cubs.</p>
        <p>''I learned a lot from everyone I've worked with, and that was one of the reasons to want to do this and to keep doing it,'' Ms. Glorsky said. With some clients, she knows not to answer her bedroom telephone in the middle of the night. She has been known to put fledgling choreographers through so many technical rehearsals that they are too tired to keep nervously interrupting their designers' work.</p>
        <p>One wrong detail can ruin the show, and the buck stops with the stage manager. ''I've always wanted to work with the best, but there is a price to pay,'' Ms. Glorsky said. ''With performers who can reach 3,000 people in a theater, that same wattage turns on you if there's some mistake, whether it's your fault or not. The only one they can go to is the stage manager. And you have to remain calm and keep the show moving.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Glorsky's West Village apartment  resembles Grand Central at rush hour. The phone rings frequently, the fax machine churns out touring schedules, and a procession of visiting photographers, filmmakers,  lighting designers, and dancers and choreographers from around the world winds in and out. Reviewers know to stay away for a month or so if they have written anything negative about one of Ms. Glorsky's companies.</p>
        <p>On a recent visit, programs, photographs, old letters and cue sheets littered Ms. Glorsky's living room. She and the archivist Mary Edsall were putting together the documents of Ms. Glorsky's life in the theater, which will eventually go to the New York Public Library's Dance Collection at Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>Some of the most fascinating documents are from Ms. Glorsky's years at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, where she started her career as a stage manager in 1959, at 18. ''My mom took me to see Frederic Franklin and Alexandra Danilova when I was about 10,'' Ms. Glorsky recalled in a recent interview. ''And that was it.''</p>
        <p>Though life was somewhat circumscribed in Toms River, N.J., where she grew up, her mother and father, Rose and Lewis, gave her a sense of wider horizons. She studied dance, which she liked ''because you were striving for perfection and you were in control,'' she said. At 12, Ms. Glorsky lied about her age to get a job as an apprentice with the Ocean County Playhouse in Toms River. She continued to dance and act in summer stock locally, with a little cheerleading thrown in, until she was accepted as a scholarship student at the Pillow, which was then under the direction of Ted Shawn, its founder.</p>
        <p>It was a heady experience. ''Shawn brought the world there,'' Ms. Glorsky said of his dizzyingly mixed presentations, which usually included American or international ballet companies, ethnic and modern dance on a single program. She became fascinated with the work backstage, doing everything from picking flowers for dressing rooms, on her own wide-eyed initiative, to helping John Christian, the festival's kindly associate director, on the antiquated lighting board. ''It was always sparking,'' she recalled. ''I'd say, 'Don't worry, just keep going.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Glorsky left the Pillow in 1963 after a terrible falling-out with Shawn that is recorded in a series of stern, almost comically injured letters from him. ''I do not want and will not have a fake Bohemian atmosphere about the place,'' Shawn wrote. A week later he wrote to say that ''Papa still loves you -- and would want nothing better than to have you erase your mistakes.''</p>
        <p>THE problems, he wrote, included her choosing her own assistants from among ''the scholarship boys'' and fraternizing with the talent. But how could one resist taking carloads of dancers to the nearby Belden Tavern to watch impromptu postperformance entertainment like the burly Alvin Ailey and the elegant ballet star Erik Bruhn dancing a pas de deux from ''Swan Lake,'' with Ailey as the ballerina? ''It was glorious,'' Ms. Glorsky said, laughing.</p>
        <p>Shawn was forced to put up with her, however, when she returned to the Pillow as stage manager with many visiting companies. While she earned a bachelor's degree in speech therapy to please her parents, she spent her nights as a stage manager and lighting assistant for designers including Tharon Musser and Nicola Cernovitch. ''I'd show up and Nick would just say, 'Let's work,' '' she recalled. She also assisted Gilbert Hemsley and the august Jean Rosenthal on Broadway and in opera.</p>
        <p>In 1971, she created the Technical Assistance Group (TAG) foundation with the lighting designer Beverly Emmons and the dance administrator William Hammond. For 10 years, the dance service organization presented regular fully produced New York seasons for small and medium-size modern dance companies, bringing an unaccustomed stability to their lives.</p>
        <p>''They all needed the same things,'' she recalled. ''Why not just consolidate?'' TAG also produced the New York Dance Festival in Central Park for five years before the group went bankrupt. ''I think the funders got interested in other things,'' Ms. Glorsky said.</p>
        <p>Each piece of paper on her living room table has a story. She talks of watching Ruth St. Denis perform her famous solo ''The Incense'' at the Pillow into her 80's, choosing the most handsome man she could find to hold the incense dish and filling the stage with so much wrinkle-hiding smoke that Ms. Glorsky could hear the audience coughing when the curtain went up.</p>
        <p>John Cage's childlike charm reminded her of Krishna. She greatly admires Mr. Baryshnikov. ''To work with a man with this kind of timing, theatricality, knowledge and discipline is worth everything,'' she said. ''You can't buy these experiences.''</p>
        <p>So much -- and so little -- has changed since Ms. Glorsky welcomed dancers with wildflowers for their dressing rooms at the Pillow.</p>
        <p>''With all the people I've worked with, it's about attaining a perfection,'' she said from the vantage point of 40 years in the theater. ''It's about this superhuman thing that dancers do that puts them a cut above other people.''</p>
