        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Wall Street's Fundamentalists Face a New World'' (Aug. 20), which looked at the independent research conducted by Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company:</p>
        <p>The article touched on some of the complex issues concerning effective and fair communication of information about public companies. Unfortunately, providing information to market participants is subject to a number of trade-offs.</p>
        <p>The recent Securities and Exchange Commission initiative on fair disclosure, for example, is intended to reduce the selective disclosure of information to favored analysts. But many companies may react defensively, by reducing the flow of information across the board to protect themselves against accusations of unfair disclosure. If this happens, improvements in fairness could come at the expense of effective communication to everyone.</p>
        <p>The quick pace of change, especially in technology-driven industries, demands even more rapid and effective communication between companies and their investors. Disgorging information in quarterly chunks, with intervening periods punctuated by legalistic company press releases, is clearly inadequate.  In the current system, analysts have an important role in prompting a more continuous flow of information, as well as their more obvious role in  interpreting the likely impact of developments on a company's stock price.</p>
        <p>Leaders in the securities industry and the corporate world need to recognize the importance of this information issue for effective markets and become proactive in finding ways to improve current performance.</p>
        <p>JOHN W. HENDRICKS  Stamford, Conn., Aug. 20</p>
