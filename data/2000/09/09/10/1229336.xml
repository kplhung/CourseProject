        <p>Is the No. 7 train the city's best subway line, or do its trains tend to bunch up and arrive inconsistently? Oddly, the answer is both, say two transit advocacy groups.</p>
        <p>On the face of it, the Straphangers Campaign, a project of the nonprofit New York Public Interest Group, would seem to differ completely with the gubernatorially appointed New York City Transit Riders Council, an advisory group to the Metropolitan Transit Authority, about the performance of the No. 7 train.</p>
        <p>The campaign rated the No. 7 as the top line in the city for the fourth year in a row in its summer 2000 report on the subway system. But a few weeks later, the council said  the No. 7 arrived at regular intervals only 75 percent of the time, placing it in the bottom third of the 23 of 25 subway lines that the group tested for reliability.</p>
        <p>The difference between the two ratings, which both drew on 1999 data, lies in the way the groups judged service on the line.</p>
        <p>The council focused exclusively on reliability and took what it called a two-day snapshot of No. 7 service by having workers stand on platforms and record the intervals of time between train arrivals. The associate director, Michael Doyle, said the workers found trains bunching up, which resulted in long waits and crowded cars.</p>
        <p>''If two trains arrive one minute apart,'' Mr. Doyle said, ''and the next one comes seven minutes later, then, wow, that train is going to be packed with passengers.''</p>
        <p>The Straphangers Campaign used Transit Authority figures to analyze six areas of service -- reliability being but one of those areas, although it carried the second-highest weight of the six. The campaign gave the No. 7 high marks for the frequency of scheduled service, the rate of train breakdowns, crowding and quality of announcements, which, when averaged together, earned the line the highest rating in the system. But the campaign found that the total score was dragged down by spotty cleaning and, more importantly, by the fact that its trains arrived at regular intervals only 73 percent of the time. So, on that measure, the campaign agreed with the council.</p>
        <p>Al O'Leary, a spokesman for New York City Transit, said the council's two-day snapshot was too small to draw meaningful conclusions. ''It's not statistically valid,'' he said. ''Therefore it's not worth talking about.''</p>
        <p>He added that the traditional method of measuring reliability, which both the campaign and the council used, was flawed. He said that the ratings of most subway lines should improve when the M.T.A. acted on its plan to measure reliability differently.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Doyle and Gene Russianoff, a spokesman for the Straphangers Campaign, said they opposed the planned change. ''That's just cooking the books,'' Mr. Russianoff said.</p>
