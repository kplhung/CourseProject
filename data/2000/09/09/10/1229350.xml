        <p>Fans of the first and only Greenmarket on Staten Island are worried that the market may lose its spot in a parking lot to an incoming courthouse. But city officials say that  plans for the courthouse are not yet firm and that there is plenty of time and room for compromise.</p>
        <p>The market sits on a municipal parking lot at Hyatt Street and St. Mark's Place in an area of St. George known for Victorian town houses and civic activism.</p>
        <p>''It's the lifeblood of this neighborhood, and we love it,'' said John Luisi, a real estate lawyer who helped start the market six years ago with eight vendors. Today it has 15 vendors.</p>
        <p>But last year the city decided to build a $40 million courthouse on part of the four-acre lot to bring together the borough's criminal, civil and family courts, which are now in Stapleton, West New Brighton and St. George. The new courthouse will be a block from Borough Hall and the district attorney, and lawyers and jurors will no longer have to be bused from court to court, said Ronald Younkins, director of court facilities for the Office of Court Administration. The other courthouses are also rundown and overcrowded, Mr. Younkins said.</p>
        <p>Perkins Eastman Architects was recently hired to design the building, he said, and an environmental analysis of the site is being made. Construction should begin in the next three years.</p>
        <p>That is time enough to talk about saving or relocating the Greenmarket, said Frank Chaney, director of land use for Staten Island's borough president, Guy V. Molinari.</p>
        <p>''I know they are very concerned,'' Mr. Chaney said of the market's supporters, ''but I've told them there's nothing to worry about for a long time.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Luisi, who is also the former president of the St. George Civic Association, said he wanted the city to promise that it would protect the market's future.</p>
        <p>''We've learned not to wait until we get to a crisis state to do anything,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Tony Mannetta of Greenmarket, a nonprofit organization that oversees the city's 28 markets, said he would like to see a permanent plaza created for the market outside the courthouse.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of a lonely space, except for the farmers on Saturday,'' Mr. Mannetta said. ''With a plaza, we could open it every day.''</p>
