        <p>Two weeks ago, Scott Layden said he expected Patrick Ewing to play his 16th professional season with the Knicks. That conviction may be changing, though.</p>
        <p>When asked yesterday if he expected Ewing to be a Knick at the start of training camp in October, Layden, the Knicks' general manager, replied with a vague response about his fondness for the club's current roster.</p>
        <p>''I think, in general terms, we continue to feel good about this team,'' Layden said in a telephone interview. ''We're always looking to improve the team. With the team we have now, with everybody in place, we feel good about this team.''</p>
        <p>Layden would neither confirm nor deny that the Knicks were discussing a three-team deal that would send Ewing to the Seattle SuperSonics, Seattle's Horace Grant to the Los Angeles Lakers and the Lakers' Glen Rice to the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''I really can't say anything,'' Layden said. ''I don't want to comment on any rumors or trades.''</p>
        <p>But this is more than a rumor. Wally Walker, the Sonics' president, contacted Grant on Friday and told him he might be traded, though he did not give Grant a team.</p>
        <p>The Lakers and the Sonics, who worked with the Knicks all week to put this package together, would love to make the trade, according to two National Basketball Association officials. They are simply waiting on the Knicks to approve the deal.</p>
        <p>The mastermind behind this latest proposal is Ewing's agent, David Falk. Desperate to move both Ewing and Rice, two of his most distinguished and disgruntled clients, Falk has worked with all three teams to find a suitable deal.</p>
        <p>''People from our organization have been in contact with Patrick,'' Layden said. ''And of course, we've talked with David Falk on a regular basis.''</p>
        <p>Moving Ewing for Rice would solve a public relations nightmare for the Knicks but would leave them woefully deficient in the middle. They already are one of the league's worst rebounding teams and losing Ewing, their best rebounder, for Rice, a small forward, would spell doom on the backboards.</p>
        <p>If the trade is completed, the Lakers would sign Rice to a multiyear contract beginning at roughly $8.3 million and trade him to the Knicks. While the Knicks covet Rice and long to move Ewing, they are not going to move hastily.</p>
        <p>''It's a possibility, but we're not going to move Patrick unless it's a good deal for us,'' said one Knicks official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>To make the trade fit the regulations of the collective bargaining agreement, the Knicks would have to take a couple of marginal players, one of whom is probably Travis Knight, the Lakers' backup center.</p>
        <p>The Knicks' decision may hinge on their confidence in their ability to pull off a subsequent trade that would bring them an accomplished big man, either a center or a power forward. With Rice, Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston on their roster, the Knicks would be in position to try and move one of them, most likely Houston, for a talented big man like Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo.</p>
