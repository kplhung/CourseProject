        <p>There are reasons they write songs about autumn in New York. And make sentimental movies about it. (Like the current one, with Richard Gere and Winona Ryder, they usually involve a series of sightseeing-driven Manhattan dates.)</p>
        <p>In real life, New York looks and feels its natural best at this time of year, beginning with that first crisp, cool morning in September (some years, in late August) right through the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, when the city transforms into its holiday self.</p>
        <p>Besides the great weather, there's fall energy in the air. The rich and the lucky, who spent summer in the Hamptons or the Vineyard or the hills of Tuscany, are back in town, all rested up for the demanding social season ahead. A new batch of the young and buoyantly ambitious just got off the train and plane and bus, determined to make it here or grow old trying.</p>
        <p>And the rest of us -- even those who don't get tickets for opening night at the New York Film Festival (Sept. 22) at Lincoln Center or qualify for the New York City Marathon (Nov. 5) -- have a new season to look forward to. There are always a few wonderful new productions or exhibitions that everyone will be talking about. Come to New York and get that back-to-school rush at any age.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>Say what you will about the Las Vegas-ization of Broadway (and it's mostly true), but this season the Great White Way is assured of some intelligent, fascinating, original American theater.</p>
        <p>One sure thing is ''Proof,'' starring the exquisite Mary-Louise Parker as the daughter of a brilliant mathematician, dealing with his death, her love life and emotional equations. The play, by David Auburn, which had a sold-out run at the Manhattan Theater Club last spring, reopens on Broadway Oct. 10. Tickets, at the Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, are $24 to $69 through Telecharge, (212) 239-6200.</p>
        <p>Another Manhattan Theater Club hit making the move to Broadway is ''The Tale of the Allergist's Wife,'' a comedy by the hysterically funny Charles Busch. Linda Lavin stars as a Manhattan dilettante having a midlife nervous breakdown on the Upper West Side. (Her psychotherapist just died.) The play begins previews on Oct. 11 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street. Tickets, $50 to $70, are available through Telecharge, (212) 239-6200.</p>
        <p>''Seussical the Musical,'' from Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, the composer and the lyricist who did ''Ragtime,'' is coming to the Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, on Oct. 15. Yes, it's based on Dr. Seuss characters: Horton the Elephant and Gertrude McFuzz, to be exact. The Cat in the Hat narrates. It opens in previews on Oct. 15. Tickets, $25 to $80, at (212) 307-4100.</p>
        <p>Uptown, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 535-7710, New York itself is the star of a splashy new exhibition. ''Art and the Empire City: New York, 1825-1861.'' It opens Sept. 19 and includes hundreds of works done in the decades before the Civil War, when the city first established itself as a cultural capital. One notable work: an 1826 portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette painted by Samuel F. B. Morse. And while you're at the museum, you could drop by its new Greek Galleries or the ''Painters in Paris'' exhibition. Suggested contribution is $10.</p>
        <p>Over on the West Side, ''Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga'' opens at the American Museum of Natural History on Oct. 21, celebrating the Scandinavians who got to North America 500 years before Columbus did. It's not all swords, battle-axes and assorted loot, either; the show also includes carvings, textiles and manuscripts. Suggested contribution: $10.</p>
        <p>At Lincoln Center, opera lovers can take in the Metropolitan Opera's new production of ''Fidelio,'' that familiar tale of a loyal wife who dresses as a man in an attempt to get her husband out of prison. James Levine, the Met's artistic director, is conducting, and Karita Mattila and Ben Heppner sing the lead roles. Opening night is Oct. 13. Tickets, $25 to $275, are available at (212) 362-6000.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>The Rose Center for Earth and Space is so new that plenty of New Yorkers haven't gotten to it yet. Occupying the northern end of the American Museum of Natural History, with a separate entrance off 81st Street and Central Park West, the four-level center includes the new Hayden Planetarium. A space show presented there every half hour features images of the night sky and a  3-D exploration of our solar system, galaxy and beyond. And those who aren't fascinated by igneous rock can stroll into the main museum and commune with the dinosaurs. Suggested contribution for the Rose Center: $10, $7.50 for students and seniors, $6 for children. For the Rose Center, the space show and the American Museum of Natural History: $19, $14 for students and seniors, $11.50 for children. Information: (212) 769-5100. Advance tickets: (212) 769-5200. The space show is popular, so it's a good idea to call a day or two ahead.</p>
        <p>The new Times Square just gets newer all the time, particularly on 42nd Street. The Conde Nast Building -- housing the staffs of magazines like Vogue, GQ and Vanity Fair -- is completed and operational at Broadway and 42nd Street. The new American Airlines Theater opened this summer with its first production (Nathan Lane in ''The Man Who Came to Dinner''). And there is a total of 38 new movie screens at the corner of 42nd and Eighth Avenue, at the Empire 25 and the Loews Cineplex combined. Madame Tussaud's wax museum is expected to open on the block shortly.</p>
        <p>Central Park, the 840-acre heart of Manhattan since Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux designed it in 1857, just keeps getting better, thanks to the Central Park Conservancy. The pond, near the 59th Street and Fifth Avenue entrance, is in the middle of a restoration (all the fish and turtles have been relocated temporarily to other park waters) that will include a new shoreline, new plantings and reconfigured walkways. Enjoying the park doesn't require a structured event, but there are Conservatory garden tours on Saturdays through October, tours of the lower park on Saturdays year round, Audubon Society bird-watching tours on weekends through November, and a Halloween parade and pumpkin sail on Oct. 22. Information: (212) 310-6660.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>For visitors who want to be truly in the middle of everything, especially the Crossroads of the World, the Hilton Times Square opened in May. At 234 West 42nd Street, (212) 840-8222, fax (212) 840-5516, it's surrounded by theaters (''The Lion King'' is practically next door). Every room has a view, since all 444, done in champagne tones, are on the 23rd floor or above. So does the sky lobby, facing north. The restaurant, Above, is run by Larry Forgione, whose signature restaurant is An American Place. Doubles begin at $325.</p>
        <p>Decades ago, proper young ladies who came to New York to begin careers (including the young Grace Kelly) stayed at the Barbizon, at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street, (800) 223-1020, fax (212) 223-3287, where gentlemen were never allowed above the lobby. These days, after a recent $40 million renovation, the Barbizon is a full-service 22-story hotel for both sexes, with a new look, contemporary furnishings in light pastels. The 306 rooms start at $325 for a double and, for $15 extra, include use of a mammoth Equinox Fitness Club, which takes up four floors of the hotel. And Bloomingdale's is three blocks away.</p>
        <p>Budget: It isn't easy, but it is possible to find a Manhattan hotel room for under $100. The Red Roof Inn chain has opened a property just a hop, skip and jump from Macy's Herald Square. The 17-story building, at 6 West 32nd Street, (212) 790-2700, fax (212) 790-2760, has 171 rooms for $89 to $329 a night, including Continental breakfast. There's an exercise room and a business center, and the mostly traditional guest rooms, done in maroons, greens and golds, have cable TV, Web access, two-line telephones and hair dryers.</p>
        <p>Luxury: The eight-story TriBeCa Grand, (212) 519-6600, fax (212) 965-3244, is so new that until recently it still had construction rubble around it, but in this neighborhood, that could be interpreted as downtown chic. There are even bouncers at the door to keep out the riffraff. Like its sister property, the SoHo Grand, the hotel isn't easy to find (2 Avenue of the Americas, at White and Church Streets, in this case). There's no sign or canopy -- just the name on the Old World clock outside and, in tiny lettering, on the front door. The atrium lobby is a little dark, but all those fashionable people in the lobby bar (''continuous cocktails and cappuccino,'' as the brochure says) may make up for that. Some are probably there to use the hotel's 98-seat screening room. The good-size rooms (by Manhattan standards) are decorated in earth tones, with a sleek look to complement the high-tech amenities (from VCR to high-speed Internet access to printer). Rooms are $399 to $849.</p>
        <p>For a real splurge, there's the Four Seasons New York, (212) 758-5700, fax (212) 758-5711, a skyscraper with 370 rooms and a marble lobby grand enough for ancient Egypt. The rooms are equally impressive (but not huge), with sophisticated city-modern decor in neutrals and luxurious Italian marble bath-dressing rooms. The hotel is on 57th Street between Park and Madison Avenues, a great site for shopping, and doubles start at $615.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>AZ, 21 West 17th Street, (212) 691-8888, offers international fusion cuisine already praised by the food critics -- and great-looking Asian decor. Dishes include halibut in soy-ginger sauce, pork chops with prunes, and duck schnitzel. Three-course prix fixe dinner, $52. Reserve well ahead.</p>
        <p>Guastavino's, 409 East 59th Street, (212) 980-2455, is Terence Conran's glamorous, huge new brasserie beneath the Queensboro Bridge, offering traditional bistro food like steak frites, a selection of caviars and more inventive dishes like lobster, corn and risotto timbale. There's a three-course lunch for $20; the prix fixe dinner is $65. And the Conran's store, full of merchandise designed within an inch of its life, is next door.</p>
        <p>Metrazur, East Balcony, Grand Central Terminal, (212) 687-4600, gives diners one of the quintessential city views: the country's largest railroad station at rush hour and the beautifully restored 1913 terminal in all its Beaux-Arts glory. The menu is Mediterranean-accented bistro fare: mushroom risotto, scallops with leeks, thyme-roasted halibut. Three-course pretheater dinner is $29.</p>
        <p>Jack Rose, 771 Eighth Avenue at 47th Street, (212) 247-7518, offers a traditional all-American menu in the middle of the theater district. Dishes include rosemary chicken, oysters Rockefeller and gigantic steaks. Dinner for two with wine, $80.</p>
        <p>Half King, 505 West 23rd Street, (212) 462-4300, is a cozy new bar in Chelsea with a touch of star power. One of its owners is Sebastian Junger, author of ''The Perfect Storm.'' There's also a menu of upscale pub food, from burgers and fish and chips to lemon sole and lamb. Dinner for two, without wine, $40.</p>
        <p>Fauchon, 442 Park Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 605-0130, is finally here for New Yorkers who would rather be on the Place de la Madeleine in Paris. It's mainly an expensive little store, with slices of quiche ($5 each), a chocolaterie, a patisserie and Fauchon-brand teas, coffees and preserves. But in one corner is a tiny, elegant salon du the, with afternoon tea for $28 a person.</p>

        <p>Correction:  September 24, 2000, Sunday  The What's Doing column on Sept. 10, about New York, included an outdated reference to the cost of a lunch at Guastavino's, the new restaurant under the Queensboro Bridge. The $20 price for a three-course lunch was discontinued after Labor Day; the meal is now $25 in the downstairs section, $35 upstairs.</p>
