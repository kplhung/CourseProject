        <p>THE cleft dividing the composers of the 19th century from those of the 20th is arguably the most prominent geographical feature of our musical landscape. Two attitudes -- on how music should sound, how it should feel and what its purpose should be -- have split audiences, musicians and commentators so decisively that in still a third century, the 21st, the gap is only marginally narrower than it was 100 years ago.</p>
        <p>On consecutive days, March 2, 3 and 4, 2001, at Carnegie Hall, the sides face each other in a format of rare concentration and potency. The Vienna Philharmonic plays; Pierre Boulez conducts. The orchestra is our guardian of Romantic self-absorption; the conductor, a musician whose sense of beauty lies outside the immediate self.</p>
        <p>The Vienna is famous for its stubborn identity: some of the world's best conductors have tried to change its sound and inflection, and have ended (wisely) by letting this orchestra do what it does. Not even a Herbert von Karajan could persuade the Vienna to make Stravinsky and Webern sound like Stravinsky and Webern, and I heard him try. Central Europe has come a long way since a frustrated Stravinsky complained of the difficulty of making its orchestras accent off the beat. But the symphony orchestra, at least in the Vienna's traditional configuration of dense strings and warm woodwinds and brasses, is a distance from the brilliant, hard surfaces favored by Mr. Boulez, his like-minded contemporaries and his immediate predecessors. Aged tiger maple and stainless steel are both beautiful materials, but they are uneasy side by side.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boulez, who in his 70's has become one of our most persuasive conductors as well as one of our most interesting composers, brings Bartok, Webern, Debussy and Stravinsky to the Vienna Philharmonic on the Friday in March. Afterward, the orchestra will be operating on its own territory with Wagner and Bruckner on the Saturday and the Mahler Third Symphony on the Sunday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Will this be a contest? The effusive gesture against the tight-lipped symmetry? The relaxed versus the tightly strung? The id versus the superego? Will the Vienna players overcome Mr. Boulez's cooler tendencies, or will he subtly channel them into an unfamiliar world of sound? Given the strong personalities of both parties, listeners should expect a certain movement at either end and a meeting somewhere near the middle, as in past meetings.</p>
        <p>The Bruckner Ninth Symphony is monumental, slow-footed and patient in a way Mr. Boulez's ''Repons'' is not. The Mahler Third Symphony, by one of music's most extraordinary imaginations, is confessional, uncomfortably so at times. The score, as they say, will spill its guts, but will its conductor be listening? To a mind as fastidious as Mr. Boulez's, Mahler intrigues with its invention and yet seems somehow vulgar for its self-indulgence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boulez, at any rate, is not the conductor he was 30 years ago. The defiant puritanism and the love of manifestoes have gone away. He is by any measure one of the most accomplished conductors alive. Players are awed by his command of any score, and they have learned to trust his gestures in difficult situations. The Vienna Philharmonic has no boss and no overriding administration. It hires the conductors its players ask for, and one expects they have responded to the qualities of a great man (for Mr. Boulez is one) regardless of stylistic differences.</p>
        <p>And a warmth has crept over his interpretations. The performances in recent years of the ''Prelude a l'Apres-Midi d'un Faune'' and ''La Mer'' by Debussy represent some of the most exquisite music-making I have ever heard. Debussy is not Mahler or Bruckner, but he straddled the two centuries in question, and some of the Innigkeit, the ''innerness,'' of those composers filters through his self-possession. Debussy's ''Jeux,'' on Friday, is one of the repertory's most difficult exercises in shifting movement. How comfortable will Vienna's champions of the foursquare feel with it?</p>
        <p>The meetings of these two minds in March will not represent any particular surprise for either. The Vienna knows precisely who Mr. Boulez is and what he does. Mr. Boulez has a long history with the Romantic repertory and has committed a lot of it to recordings. The Prelude and ''Liebestod'' from ''Tristan und Isolde,'' on Saturday, will remind listeners that the conductor led the famously controversial production of ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'' at the Bayreuth Festival in 1976. Just as Patrice Chereau's starkly updated staging both thrilled and rankled, Mr. Boulez's idea of Wagner troubled or pleased just as many for its perceived objectivity and coolness. Bayreuth's orchestra, indeed, was so disturbed at Mr. Boulez's suppression of the operas' themes and leitmotifs that the conductor at one point in the proceedings offered to resign. At the curtain calls of ''Gotterdammerung,'' the musicians traditionally take the stage, but they refused to appear with this conductor.</p>
        <p>THAT, however, was a long time ago. Mr. Boulez has changed, and music has changed. So, too, have we listeners, and that may be the most important shift of all. So powerful has been the appeal of Romantic and post-Romantic music that the 20th century as a whole is seen by some as a defense against it, a recoiling from a threatening force rather than a thing in itself. The defense has not held. We still like Brahms and Tchaikovsky as much as we ever did, though perhaps the musical aesthetic of a Pierre Boulez inhabits our ears more than we know and subtly changes our experience.</p>
        <p>That, to me, is the fascination of these three concerts. They suggest that the conciliation between two musical cultures is still a work in progress and that perhaps a progress report is due.</p>
