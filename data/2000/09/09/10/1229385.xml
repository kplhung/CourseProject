        <p>PRODUCTIVITY.</p>
        <p>That word, more than any other, explains the phenomenal performance of United States stock markets over the last six years, a period in which the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index tripled and the Nasdaq composite rose fivefold.</p>
        <p>Higher productivity enables companies to increase sales without adding workers. Even if job markets tighten and wages rise, corporate profits can continue to climb as long as worker productivity is growing faster than overall wages. And, over time, higher earnings spell higher stock prices, since a stock is in essence nothing more than a claim on a share of a company's future profits.</p>
        <p>Productivity is just as important to the health of the overall economy. Despite the Sturm und Drang over the Federal Reserve's periodic efforts to control the economy by changing short-term interest rates -- and despite the debate over the best use of the government's huge surplus -- productivity is all that matters in the long run. Individual income can grow only as fast as productivity rises.</p>
        <p>So for stock market bulls, the report on Wednesday that United States productivity increased at an annual rate of 5.7 percent from April through June was extremely good news, providing another bit of evidence that the economy and corporate profits can grow far faster than most economists thought just a couple of years ago.</p>
        <p>Over all, productivity rose 5.2 percent in the 12 months ended June 30, the biggest year-over-year increase since 1983, when the United States was emerging from a deep recession. In contrast, the gains this year came after almost a decade of economic growth, with job markets tight and skilled workers scarce. In fact, productivity growth has increased steadily since late 1996.</p>
        <p>Now a growing number of economists are accepting the once-heretical view that the United States may have permanently increased the rate at which its economy can grow without inflation, thanks to advances in computing and information technology.</p>
        <p>''Wherever productivity growth is today, my guess is that in six months or a year, it will be higher still,'' said Stephen Slifer, the chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers. ''About once in 100 years, something really big happens, and this is it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Slifer said he believes that the nation's economy can now grow at an annual rate of 4.5 percent without risking higher inflation, thanks to higher productivity. By next year, he expects that growth at an inflation-free rate of 5 percent will be possible.</p>
        <p>Risking the scorn of skeptics, Mr. Slifer added that he had begun to believe that recessions were no longer inevitable. ''Is it inconceivable to think this thing can keep going, and in 2010 we could see the 20th year of this expansion?'' he asked. ''No.''</p>
        <p>Business cycles lengthened greatly during the 20th century, as central banks learned to manage national economies by raising and lowering interest rates. Now, with productivity soaring, all the Federal Reserve needs to do is stay out of the way, Mr. Slifer argues.</p>
        <p>For investors, that means that stocks will continue to outperform bonds and cash over both the short and long terms, according to Jeffrey Applegate, Lehman's chief investment strategist. Mr. Applegate, a longtime bull, said corporate profit margins had increased almost across the board over the last decade. ''At the peak of the last business cycle, after-tax margins for the S.&amp; P. 500 were 5.6 percent,'' Mr. Applegate said. ''In the first quarter of 2000, margins were 7.8 percent.'' And they have probably risen since then, he added.</p>
        <p>But what about the skeptics, who point to a legion of potential problems, including higher oil prices, the nation's giant trade deficit, the possibility that productivity growth is overstated, and the high prices of many technology stocks? Mr. Slifer advises them to open their eyes.</p>
        <p>''They keep trying to find the problems,'' he said, ''and every year comes and goes, and things still look as good as they have before.''</p>
