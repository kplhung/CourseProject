        <p>KAREN SCAVOTTO, 18, of Enfield, peeled down her white sock to display the Olympic rings tattooed on her right ankle. A white billboard with a red-and-blue striped border bid her well on the lawn not far away.</p>
        <p>As a blue compact car came down the street, the driver honked, waved and yelled, ''All the way, U.S.A.!'' ''Everybody honks and waves around here,'' Scavotto said with a grin.</p>
        <p>At the Summer Olympics in Sydney, which open Friday, Scavotto will be one of 10 athletes who grew up or now live in Connecticut to represent the United States. That's down from 13 in 1996.</p>
        <p>Connecticut is certainly not a powerhouse at the Olympics, like, say California, which has about 150 athletes, and Texas, with about 40. But over the years the state has nurtured a number of outstanding Olympians. Bruce Jenner, who won the 1976 gold medal in the decathlon, is from Newtown. Bill Toomey of New Canaan won the same event in 1968. Dorothy Hamill, the 1976 gold medal figure skater, is from Riverside, a section of Greenwich. Lindy Remigino, who graduated from Hartford Public High School, won two gold medals at the 1952 Games -- in the men's 100-meter dash and 4x100 relay team.</p>
        <p>This year, the state is sending three rowers, two of them, Atwood Porter Collins, 25, and Christine Smith Collins, 31 (no relation), are from Darien. The third rower, Conal Groom, 27, is from Northford.</p>
        <p>There are two judo players -- Alex Ottiano, 24, who grew up in Plainfield and Brandan Greczkowski, 23, of Plainfield. Another archer, Richard (Butch) Johnson, 45, of Woodstock, is also on the team.</p>
        <p>Then there are the pros. Vin Baker, a power forward for the Seattle SuperSonics who graduated from Old Saybrook High School, will compete for the Olympic men's basketball team. Kara Wolters of Manchester, who played for the University of Connecticut women's basketball team and now is with the Indiana Fever in the Women's National Basketball Association, is on the Olympic team.</p>
        <p>Also, Kristine Lilly, 29, of Wilton, who played on the women's soccer team in 1996, is on the team again.</p>
        <p>Baker and Wolters are probably the state's best hope for bringing home a gold, simply because of the country's dominance in basketball. But Lilly and Johnson won golds in 1996 and most of the other athletes have won various national and world championships. Scavotto is the No. 4-ranked archer in the world. So Connecticut can make an impact at the games.</p>
        <p>When Scavotto was 8, she begged her father for a bow and arrow. It was after she saw him return home from deer hunting. Scavotto wanted to shoot, too. James Scavotto bought his daughter a plastic bow and arrow, but she wanted the real thing. She pointed to her older sister Lisa's saxophone. ''Lisa has a real instrument,'' her father said Karen told him. ''I want a real bow.''</p>
        <p>Her father bought her a real bow and Karen started taking lessons with Tricia Hall, Johnson's wife and a 13-time national champion. Scavotto was so tiny that her nickname was Peanut and so shy that she barely spoke. She started competing at national championships, taking along her stuffed toy rabbit -- Carrots -- for luck.</p>
        <p>In 1996, Richard Johnson brought back his Olympic team gold medal. Scavotto placed the medal around her neck. ''I want one of these, too,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''She just wanted to do it,'' Johnson said. She shot hundreds of arrows for hours each day on the long patch of lawn adjacent to her aunt Marianne Gauvin's house and alongside grandfather Joseph Kulina's vegetable garden in Enfield. She took honors and advanced placement courses, and she was on the high honor roll at Enfield High School. Last June, Scavotto graduated No. 8 in her class of 187.</p>
        <p>Scavotto has won five national junior titles and broken six United States junior records. She holds two junior world records, too. She won the individual gold medal at the Sydney International Golden Arrow in her first international competition as a senior archer last year. In August, Scavotto won the United States National Target Championships and set two senior national records.</p>
        <p>When Scavotto received the package with her Olympic uniform, reality finally sunk in. ''I started to say, 'Wow, I'm here to represent my country at the Olympics,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>Johnson, who has been coaching Scavotto for the past five years, grew up in Worcester and Webster, Mass. When he was 15, an archery shooting range opened in Johnson's neighborhood. Six months later, Johnson won the Massachusetts state championship.</p>
        <p>Johnson became the first archer from Connecticut and New England to make the United States Olympic team in 1992. He finished 18th then and 11th in Atlanta. At the 1996 Games, he fired six perfect shots in the gold medal team match against Korea, contributing 86 of a possible 90 points to the Americans. The United States won its first Olympic team gold medal in archery.</p>
        <p>Johnson, who holds some world records, also has won numerous national championships. How many Olympic athletes also coach someone on their team? ''I would imagine it's somewhat unusual,'' Johnson said. ''Most people get into coaching to get out of the competitive part of it. Most of the people coaching aren't competing. I just happen to be doing both.''</p>
        <p>Joined in Judo</p>
        <p>Ottiano and Greczkowski grew up around the corner from each other in Plainfield and both attended Brown University in Rhode Island. Greczkowski was 7 when he watched the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and first dreamed about making an Olympic team in some sport. Next year, when  Greczkowski was 8, he met Ottiano in a judo class in Plainfield. The lessons were birthday presents for both boys, and Greczkowski decided judo would become his Olympic sport. He even asked his mother, Christine, if he could get a tattoo with Olympic rings if he made the games. Christine Greczkowski nodded absentmindedly. She never dreamed her son would do it. Greczkowski did, and proudly raises his shirt sleeve to show the Olympic rings etched on his left bicep.</p>
        <p>Ottiano competed with his older sister, Jennifer, on Windham High's wrestling team. Jennifer was the only girl. Ottiano won the State Open twice at Windham. Greczkowski won the State Open in wrestling as a junior at Killingly High. At the same time, he continued to compete in national judo competitions.</p>
        <p>In 1995, at the end of his junior year, Greczkowski was invited by the United States judo team to train at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. Only the top five athletes are invited to live and train there. Greczkowski hoped to make the 1996 Olympic team the following year.</p>
        <p>He was devastated when he was named first alternate on the 1996 Olympic team in the 60-kilogram division (132 pounds). There are seven different weight classes in judo, and Greczkowski could commiserate with Ottiano. He was first alternate in the 66 kilograms (145 pounds).</p>
        <p>Though he was still growing and gaining weight, Greczkowski didn't want to move up in weight class. He had been winning in 60 kilograms and wanted to keep going. Though his normal weight is now 150, Greczkowski refrains from eating much to keep within the 132-pound limit. He eats a bagel and cream cheese for breakfast. Grapes and a granola bar during the day, and a grinder at dinner. Period.</p>
        <p>The dieting paid off. Grezkowski qualified for the 60-kilogram event at the Olympics. So did Ottiano. They are also the United States national champions in their divisions.</p>
        <p>Ottiano took his first judo class at 10 and he and his sister, Jennifer, competed in judo tournaments around the country and also in wrestling at Windham High School. (Plainfield High School didn't have a team.) Jennifer was the only girl on the boys' wrestling team, and she was also a national women's judo champion in her weight class. Wrestling teammates kidded them about who could beat whom.</p>
        <p>Ottiano, who now lives in Lawrence, Mass., will compete on Sept. 17; Greczkowski the day before. He is thankful that his competition will be held right away, one day after the Olympic torch-lighting ceremony. He can't wait to hit the Olympic cafeteria and eat.</p>
        <p>Both Greczkowski and Ottiano want to keep training for the 2004 Games, too. Greczkowski will probably compete in the next highest weigh class -- Ottiano's.</p>
        <p>Making Wilton Proud</p>
        <p>It's Lilly's second trip to the Olympics. Lilly, 29, will be on the field with Mia Hamm, her old University of North Carolina teammate, fighting for a second consecutive gold medal in women's soccer. When Lilly grew up in Wilton, there weren't many girls' soccer teams, so Lilly joined the all-boys' youth travel team. She played with them from second through eighth grade, and was one of the best players on the team.</p>
        <p>At Wilton High School, Lilly helped the Wilton Warriors win three state championships before graduating in 1989. At North Carolina, Lilly and Hamm helped the Tar Heels win four National Collegiate Athletic Association titles.</p>
        <p>At the 1999 Women's World Cup, it was Lilly who sent a Chinese shot on goal safely off line in overtime to preserve a tie. She scored one of America's penalty kicks to put the Americans ahead. The United States won, 5-4, and Lilly was named the most valuable player.</p>
        <p>Wilton is so proud of Lilly that it welcomes visitors at either end of town with these signs: ''Welcome to Wilton, Home of Kristine Lilly, 1996 Olympic Gold Medalist.''</p>
        <p>Wilton welcomed Lilly back from her first Olympics with a parade and named its high school soccer field after her. Wilton High School retired her jersey -- her lucky 13 -- too.</p>
        <p>Second Chance in Rowing</p>
        <p>While Lilly and the other athletes prepared to leave for Sydney, the rowers Conal Groom, Porter Collins and Christine Smith Collins were already there. They have been training in Sydney since Aug. 27 to get acclimated to the different culture, climate (winter) and time zone. They live in a condo on the beach in Yamba, northeast of Sydney.</p>
        <p>''The Australian hospitality is incredible,'' Groom said by phone from Sydney. ''People talk about Southern hospitality, but this blows it off the map.''</p>
        <p>Groom was a soccer goalie when he took up rowing during his freshman year at the Berkshire School in Sheffield. He didn't know much about rowing, but fell in love with the sport. Luckily, it was a fall and spring sport at Berkshire, and the extra training sharpened Groom's skills and kept him in shape.</p>
        <p>At Georgetown University, the school made an exception and allowed Groom to row varsity as a freshman. Georgetown Coach Tony Johnson told Groom's father that his son had the talent to make the United States Olympic team.</p>
        <p>Groom won the most valuable oarsman award at Georgetown three years in a row and was captain of the team for two years. His partner in lightweight double sculls (each oarsmen with two oars) at the 1996 Olympic trials was his older brother, Sean. Sean had twisted his left ankle while running the week before trials. It was painfully swollen during trials. Then, Conal tore a hamstring halfway through a race. The brother tandem didn't make the 1996 team.</p>
        <p>''I definitely cried for awhile,'' Conal Groom said. ''There was nothing I could do at that point, but vow that I would be healthy enough in 2000 and I was going to come back no matter what.''</p>
        <p>With a new lightweight doubles partner, Steve Tucker, Groom did.</p>
        <p>Like Groom, Porter Collins started rowing in high school, in his case after failing to make the golf team at Salisbury School. He went on to row at Brown University, where he was an oarsman on Brown's 1995 college champion varsity eight team. Collins graduated from Brown in 1997 and will row in the men's eight in Sydney -- an eight-man boat in which each rower has one oar. It is known as a ''sweep'' event and is considered rowing's premier event.</p>
        <p>From 1920 to 1956, the United States won every gold medal in the men's eight. It hasn't won a gold in the event since. Porter Collins would like to change that. This is his second Olympics and he and his national teammates are coached by Mike Teti, the Princeton men's coach. With Teti, who took over the men's sweep program after the 1996 Games, Collins and the men's eight won the gold medal at the past two  world championships held by the International Federation of Rowing Associations.</p>
        <p>Smith Collins has won four world championships, more than any female in United States rowing history, but she didn't start rowing until college. She was a track star at Darien High School and took up rowing her freshman year at Trinity College in Hartford.</p>
        <p>''I loved it from Day 1,'' Smith Collins said from Sydney. ''I liked the team aspect of it. It required a lot of team work in order to be successful, and it presented a continual series of challenges.''</p>
        <p>With her lightweight doubles partner, Sarah Garner, Smith Collins won the 1998 world championship. Smith Collins is also an eight-time national champion.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be an amazing experience, no matter what happens,'' Smith Collins said of the Olympics. ''It's nice to feel like all the hard work is really paying off. It's rewarding to be able to represent the U.S. Not only can I be an ambassador for the U.S., but for the other sports as well. I'm really excited about meeting the other athletes and relishing in sports.''</p>
