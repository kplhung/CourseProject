      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Pashmina, the extremely light wool sheared from the belly of a Himalayan mountain goat, has been relegated as a luxury fabric of yesterday. So what's the next sybaritic wrap?</p>
        <p>Jean-Philippe Bouyer, a Paris designer, has created an eight-foot rabbit fur scarf, far left, striped in red, white, green and orange ( $1,350 at Barneys New York). There are also scarves woven of Escorial, spun from the wool of 50,000 North African sheep being raised in Tasmania and New Zealand. ''The sheep are really tiny, half the size of normal sheep,'' or about two feet tall, said Ben Frankel, creative director of Escorial, the London company that owns the herds and the trademark. Escorial is a light yarn that possesses a natural elasticity and, because it takes colors well, comes in brighter shades than pashmina pastels. At Saks Fifth Avenue, a plain 80-inch scarf, available in 20 shades, is $350.</p>

        <p>Judy Ross, a rug and fabric designer, also creates scarves, which she has hand-embroidered with bold graphic patterns in Kashmir, India. But she uses wool, not pashmina, which ''can't hold a large embroidered image,'' Ms. Ross said. ''The weave isn't as tight.'' Her 72-inch scarves ($225), left, can be ordered by calling (212) 842-1705.</p>
