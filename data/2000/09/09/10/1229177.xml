        <p>AFTER 11 hours at sea, the Enterprise is the first boat to steam into port here on a recent overcast afternoon, loaded down with 28 cages holding about 900 bushels of surf clams. Soon after the 2,900-pound cages are lifted from the Enterprise's hole by crane and stacked on the dock for shipping, the Debbie Jeanette pulls up with her haul of 48 cages of tightly packed quahogs.</p>
        <p>Over the next few hours, five more boats are due in, each carrying from 28 to 112 cages full of clams, all dredged from the clam-rich ocean floor off the New Jersey coastline.</p>
        <p>With 2.5 million bushels of surf clams and 3.7 million bushels of ocean quahogs caught last year, the state is by far the leading clam supplier to the world, providing 80 percent of all surf clams and 40 percent of all quahogs consumed. The tongues of the surf clams are cut into strips for fried clams, while the rest of them, as well as the meat from quahogs, are chopped for clam chowder and clam sauce.</p>
        <p>In terms of top edible species of seafood caught in New Jersey, the two ocean clams account for more than 50 percent of the state's total haul. In-shore hard clams, used for clams on the half shell, on the other hand, account for less than 1 percent of the state's total catch.</p>
        <p>Once considered an overfished resource, the offshore clams are now so plentiful that the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council last month voted to increase the allowable annual catch of surf clams for the first time in 10 years. Starting Oct. 1, the quota will increase by 11 percent, to 2.85 million bushels the first year, and an additional 5 percent each year over the next four years.</p>
        <p>But getting the increase was not easy for an industry that while highly regulated has had its share of controversy in the last decade. From the 1990 privatization of clamming that left most of the business in the hands of a few people to a string of freak accidents last year that took the lives of 10 clammers and left family members and colleagues reeling, the clam industry in New Jersey has been described as everything from a model fishery to a monopolistic society of winners and losers.</p>
        <p>The latest win for the industry came after a five-year battle with the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, the regional regulatory arm of the National Marine Fisheries Service, which in 1996 lowered the clam quota by 10 percent after sample dredges in 1994 seemed to support suspicions that the fishery was being depleted. The industry then sued, claiming that the government's measurements were faulty, and decided to do its own testing.</p>
        <p>WITH donated boats, crews and a $100,000 program developed by Haskin Shellfish Research Lab of Rutgers University and the College of William and Mary's Virginia Institute of Marine Science, the clam industry was right behind the fisheries service when the agency performed new tests in 1997.</p>
        <p>''The industry decided the best way to tackle the problem was to become more involved in the science being used to develop management programs,'' said Dr. Eric Powell, the director of Haskin Shellfish Lab.</p>
        <p>While the fisheries service made one or two tows of an area, boats involved in the private study dredged the same site 30 to 40 times. Dr. Tom Hoff, senior ecologist of the management council, called the industry's study ''instrumental'' in its recommendation to raise the quota. ''We got better, more precise measurements,'' Dr. Hoff said.</p>
        <p>Those findings led to an increase in the quahog quota last year and this year's raising of surf clam limits. For the industry, the higher quotas mean more business; they also lend an air of legitimacy to a fishery that has been wracked with charges of greedy -- and sometimes illegal -- behavior on the part of boat owners and captains.</p>
        <p>''The public's perception is that we're overharvesting,'' said Danny Cohen, president of Atlantic Capes Fisheries, who owns 11 fishing vessels that operate here and in Cape May. ''The fishermen became more active in the development of science so that the public can feel more comfortable in consuming the product.''</p>
        <p>The New Jersey ocean clam industry was valued at $38.5 million in 1998, almost four times the state's next most valuable ocean resource, sea scallops. That number represents money paid to the fishery. After factoring in clam processing -- a fair amount of which is done in the state -- and retail sales, the value of the clam industry is estimated at six to seven times that amount.</p>
        <p>Clams have long been big business for New Jersey, ever since the 1950's when Americans first developed a taste for fried clams, popularized by Howard Johnson's all-you-can-eat clam nights. But surf clams -- and every other living creature off the coast of New Jersey -- were wiped out in 1976 by a bout of anoxia, or lack of oxygen. While the clams came back by the early 1980's, with them came stricter regulations, which included a moratorium on any new clam licenses and a sharp reduction in the amount of clams that could be caught.</p>
        <p>At that time, the system was controlled by limiting the time a boat could be on the ocean, at one point dropping to one six-hour trip every two weeks. This forced clammers to add boats to their fleets to get more days at sea. It also created a situation in which captains were compelled to go out even in bad weather if it was a designated day.</p>
        <p>By the late 1980's, clammers were asking for a more equitable system and in 1990 the management council came up with the concept divided the total annual clam allocation among operating clamming vessels, based on their historical catches, and allowed boat owners to sell or rent their quotas to others if they weren't using them. The result was a rapid consolidation of the industry, with small-boat owners or those tired of the business selling or leasing their allocations to large fleet owners or processors.</p>
        <p>While there was some concern about giving away a natural resource, according to Dr. Hoff, the self-policing that resulted created what he called ''the best managed resource in the country.'' Some, however, questioned a system that left a valuable resource in the hands of very few people.</p>
        <p>Today, about 50 offshore clam boats operate on the East Coast, about 40 of which are owned by fewer than 10 people. With allocation rights being leased annually for $5 to $7 a bushel, or sold for about $65 a bushel, the quota system has made several clam boat owners millionaires.</p>
        <p>''The allocations are like gold,'' said Bob Bondurant, plant manager at Point Pleasant Packaging, Atlantic Capes Fisheries' clam shucking operation. ''If you own 30 or 50,000 bushels, you can make yourself a nice piece of change just by leasing them.''</p>
        <p>The high cost of buying or leasing clamming rights, combined with the $1 million price tag for the now highly mechanized clam boats, makes it virtually impossible for a newcomer to enter the business. Even for those who have been in the field for some time, like Jimmy Stock, who has been captain of the Enterprise for 19 years, advancement is not a possibility. This also discourages young people from signing on, Mr. Stock noted.</p>
        <p>''Young kids would rather go to a Metallica concert than work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with no benefits,'' said he 48-year-old captain.</p>
        <p>Most of the year, Mr. Stock spends five days a week at sea, working 15- to 20-hour days, to meet market demand and his boat's quota of 100,000 bushels. He sleeps on the boat during the week and returns home to the Poconos each Friday. Today is a typical day -- a crew member has sliced his finger while hooking up the cages to be lifted ashore. A bandage is quickly applied, and he is back to work.</p>
        <p>Quahogs, which can live up to 200 years, prefer the cooler waters found several hundred feet below the surface, so Ed Platter has to take his boat, the Debbie Jeanette, much farther offshore before he can start dredging. Returning from the 27-hour trip, 75 miles offshore, Mr. Platter pulls his 120-foot boat to the dock to begin unloading. The 43-year-old captain took his first clam boat ride when he was 13 and has been in charge of this boat since he was 21.</p>
        <p>Like many other commercial fishing operations, clamming has become highly technical, with satellite global positioning systems that allow captains to plot their course and revisit good clam beds. But even with the advanced technology, a big part of one's success depends on having a knack for it.</p>
        <p>''For all the equipment you have, you still have to find them. Clams are going to look for a place to get out of the tides, so if you see a little edge, you follow it,'' said Mr. Platter.</p>
        <p>Dragging his 150-inch dredge about 700 feet below the ocean surface, Mr. Platter feels for dips or shelves where the quahogs might go after spawning so they can mature safely. Safe, that is, until Mr. Platter's knife-edged blade scoops them into a wide basket, lifting them out of the water and dumping them into a hopper on board the ship. From there, they travel along a conveyor belt where the crew looks over the catch for  rocks, crabs or clams that are too small before dropping the acceptable quahogs into the cages below.</p>
        <p>THE work is grueling, but clammers can earn a good living. While he may not become a millionaire like the boat's owner, an experienced captain can earn more than $100,000, and crew members can earn from $50,000 to $70,000.</p>
        <p>''It's really good money,'' said Debbie Platter, Mr. Platter's wife. ''Where else are you going to earn 60, 70, $80,000 without a college education? It's a tough life, it's very dangerous, but once you get that paycheck of $2,000 for the week you get sucked in and you can't get out.''</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Platter is aware of the danger. Even the slightest breeze sends her radar into overdrive, worrying that 5-mile-per-hour winds on land can translate into 10- to 12-foot waves at sea. Commercial fishing is one of the most dangerous occupations, and clam fishing is no exception. Loaded down with heavy equipment and thousands of pounds of clams, the flat-bottomed boats sit low on the water, making them susceptible to choppy seas or rogue waves.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Stewart Tweed, a marine extension agent for Rutgers who teaches a safety course to clammers, said dredging created other inherent dangers. ''You're dragging this dredge six to eight inches into the bottom of the ocean,'' Mr. Tweed said. ''When you're pulling it along, if something in the bottom hooks you and pulls you in the right direction, very quickly you're going to be taking water over the stern.''</p>
        <p>In the last five years, Mr. Tweed has put 180 captains and crew members through his two-day safety course, which covers subjects from making a Mayday call to getting into the survival suits now required to be kept on board. Initially, ''it was like pulling teeth to get the men to give up fishing time to take the course,'' Mr. Tweed said, but once they recognized its value the response picked up, especially after last year's slew of clam boat accidents.</p>
        <p>Like the Crow's Nest in ''The Perfect Storm'', Broadway Bar and Grill on Ocean Avenue across from Manasquan Inlet here is the place where most clammers and fishermen can be found before or after trips at sea, or gather to wait out bad weather. The J-shaped bar is lined with old fishing photos, the walls are decorated with clam rakes and pieces of wooden boat hulls. In a glass case behind the bumper pool table sits a shiny brass bell, inscribed with the names of the four local men who went down with the Adriatic when it sank off Long Beach Island on Jan. 18, 1999.</p>
        <p>In a freakish series of events that reduced the clam boat population by 9 percent, the Adriatic's sinking was the fourth clam boat tragedy in 13 days that winter. On Jan. 6, the Beth Dee Bob sank 13 miles outside Manasquan Inlet, losing its four-man crew. Two days later, Cape Fear, a clamming vessel that often worked out of Point Pleasant, sank off New Bedford, Mass., and two men lost their lives. And just a day before the Adriatic tragedy, the Ellie B rammed head-on into the Manasquan Inlet jetty, destroying the boat but sparing the lives on board.</p>
        <p>Kathy Becica, who, with her husband Bill, runs the Point Pleasant Packing Company where the boats docked, has spent the past 19 months trying to get a memorial built here. Several local companies and individuals donated their time and services to create the memorial, which will be unveiled at the official dedication ceremony on Oct. 8.  Facing the inlet in Loughran Point Park, the memorial will include a bronze statue of a fisherman holding a lantern (which Bill Becica posed for), surrounded by a railing imprinted with the names of about 100 fishermen who have lost their lives at sea off this inlet since 1931.</p>
        <p>''These men all lived and worked here,'' said Ms. Becica, who is thankful that she survived 30 years of her husband's deep-sea clamming, and another five years of her son Sean, who clammed until the sinking of the Adriatic and Beth Dee Bob, both of which he crewed on shortly before they went down. ''I just thought it would be a nice thing to do in their memory. For the families, it's a place for them to go. One man who lost his life had a young son. Now he can go there and see his father's name and touch it. For the guys still fishing, hopefully it will be a reminder to be a little more careful.''</p>
        <p>IT is late afternoon at the docks, where dozens of six-foot-tall cages full of fat ocean clams wait to be trucked to processing plants in the state or in New England. A smaller percentage of the surf clams will be shucked here at Point Pleasant Packing Company, which began its hand-shucking operation last November. About twice a week, a crew of 15 or 20 shuckers shows up before dawn to begin turning the bushels of clams into usable meat. Running a wide-bladed knife around the rim of the shell, a good shucker can shuck about three bushels of clams in 15 minutes, said Mr. Bondurant, the plant manager. The three bushels convert to about five gallons of meat, for which a shucker gets paid $2.30. The buckets of meat then go onto a second line of squeezers, who separate the tongues from the salvage, then squeeze the bellies out of the tongues, leaving just the precious slab of clam that will be sent elsewhere for stripping.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bondurant's operation is relatively new, Cape May Foods has been processing clams since 1930 and as the country's largest hand-shucking operation, supplies clams to some of the country's major seafood restaurant chains. Owned by Peter LaMonica, Cape May Foods owns or leases five clamming vessels and controls the allocation of 1.7 million bushels of quahogs and 680,000 bushels of surf clams. The canned clams are also sold in supermarkets, under the Cape May and LaMonica labels.</p>
        <p>With two shifts running daily, the plant buzzes with 110 workers shucking, separating, washing, chopping and canning clams. A sister plant cuts the tongues into strips and breads them for frying. Last year, the company began exporting clams to Japan for use in sushi and soup, said John Boland, head of sales and marketing for Cape May Foods. But the big competition is to find a new use for clams.</p>
        <p>''Everyone in the industry is looking for ways to increase the vocabulary of clams,'' Mr. Boland said. ''People are constantly looking for new and improved ways to use clams.'' He cited clam steaks and clam tenders as two new applications being developed.</p>
        <p>''I see them moving from an appetizer to the center of the plate, into the mainstream,'' he added, ''right between chicken and veal on the menu.''</p>
