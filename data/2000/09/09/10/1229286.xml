        <p>Ten years ago my husband and I moved to West Lane in South Salem. We fell in love with the open grassy areas and woods. We especially liked the fact that the town residents did not have fences bordering their properties. It is a pleasing and natural look.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Ten years ago my husband and I moved to West Lane in South Salem. We fell in love with the open grassy areas and woods. We especially liked the fact that the town residents did not have fences bordering their properties. It is a pleasing and natural look.</p>
        <p>I have noticed a definite increase in the amount of traffic on West Lane over the past 10 years, especially heavy truck traffic. West Lane is used as a shortcut to go from State Route 123 in New York to State Route 35 in Connecticut and vice versa.</p>
        <p>I am particularly concerned about the ''through truck'' traffic because I now have a 2-year-old daughter. She loves to run around the yard just as every child does. The traffic is so heavy that I have great concern about her safety. In addition to the heavy traffic, trucks regularly pull into my driveway. As a result, I will be forced to install a fence across the front of my property and a gate across my driveway.</p>
        <p>I have asked town officials to establish a ''no-through truck'' designation for West Lane.</p>
