        <p>AT low tide, marine biologists monitor wooden racks and silos full of tiny oysters and clams on the mud flats outside the weather-beaten houses of this remote hatchery on the Delaware Bay north of Cape May.</p>
        <p>The shellfish the hatchery workers are following are not any ordinary oysters or clams. They are part of Rutgers' Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory's extensive aquaculture program, which is trying to create in a petri dish that which cannot be created in nature.</p>
        <p>Although the effort to ''grow'' oysters has been less successful, largely because of two infestations that have wreaked havoc on the oyster population, the culturing of surf clams has met with rousing success in the last two years, according to the manager of the hatchery, Gregory A. DeBrosse. Having solved the problem of getting surf clams to spawn in an artificial environment, the lab went from producing 10,000 clams last year to 1.5 million clams this spring.</p>
        <p>When the clams have reached a viable size, they are put back into controlled silos in the sea, where within six months they grow to marketable size -- in this case about two to three inches, or less than half the size of surf clams found in the ocean. If successful, the cultured clams will provide a whole new small clam product, akin to the West Coast's butter clams, used on pasta dishes or eaten on the half-shell. By this fall, Dr. Eric Powell, director of the lab, expects the hatchery to have close to five million small surf clams ready to send out in a pilot marketing program to area restaurants.</p>
        <p>This fall also marks the time when the 72-year-old hatchery will have to shut its doors if a supplemental request for funds is not approved by the State Legislature and signed by the governor. Haskin lost its $150,000 core operating budget on July 1 when it was included as a line item in an appropriations request by Rutgers for $1.1 million for aquaculture development, which was not included in the final approved budget.</p>
        <p>Since then, the hatchery and many of the administrative functions at Haskin's headquarters in Bivalve have been operating on leftover grant money and a promise from Rutgers to keep them going through the fall. Beyond that, they are hoping their request for a supplemental grant-in-aid appropriation of $350,000 for Rutgers' Agricultural Experiment Station, which Haskin falls under, receives approval when it is put before the State Assembly. The money would be used for Haskin's operating shortfall as well as maintaining a marine advisory program and financing a finfish dynamics program.</p>
        <p>''We have sufficient resources to carry us through the end of September, and Rutgers University has agreed to keep us going through November,'' Dr. Powell said. ''We have a supplemental request before the Legislature so we'll have to see what happens. If that is not successful, we won't completely disappear, but we'll be hard to see.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the aquaculture program, the Haskin lab studies shellfish disease, population dynamics and genetics. As the country's leading research lab for surf clams and quahogs, Haskin played a crucial role in the recent study measuring the ocean's clam population, which led to the increase in clam quota.</p>
        <p>Dr. Powell said he was ''fairly comfortable'' that the Legislature would pass the supplemental budget request, but that he was ''not sure'' Governor Whitman would sign it.''</p>
        <p>The Agricultural Experiment Station did receive an additional $627,000 in this year's state budget, said Jayne O'Connor, the governor's press secretary, and each year Haskin receives $95,000 from the state.</p>
        <p>''If the extension station chose not to use any of that money for aquaculture, that was their decision,'' Ms. O'Connor said. As for the supplementary request, Ms. O'Connor said, ''The governor will definitely consider the legislation when it is sent to her for review.''</p>
