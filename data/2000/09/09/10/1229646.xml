        <p>IN 1896, the Republican boss Mark Hanna distributed phony half dollars bearing the likeness of the Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and the legend ''In God We Trust . . . for the other forty seven cents.'' It was the Republicans' way of warning what would happen to the economy should free silver champion Bryan defeat William McKinley in the coming election.</p>
        <p>The bogus coin is among scores of political artifacts being assembled by the Museum of American Political Life at the University of Hartford -- which describes itself as the nation's only museum devoted exclusively to presidential campaign memorabilia -- for a special election-year exhibition recalling six significant presidential elections.</p>
        <p>Items from the elections of 1800 (Thomas Jefferson vs. John Adams), 1828 (Andrew Jackson vs. John Quincy Adams), 1860 (Abraham Lincoln vs. Stephen Douglas, John Bell and John Breckenridge), 1896 (McKinley vs. Bryan), 1932 (Franklin Delano Roosevelt vs. Herbert Hoover) and 1980 (Ronald Reagan vs. Jimmy Carter) will be showcased from today through the end of the year. The items come from a collection of 60,000 (only the Smithsonian Institution has a larger collection).</p>
        <p>The museum' director, Zina Davis, said the 1800 election was selected for the exhibition because it was the first in which the presidency passed from one party, the Federalists, to another, the Democratic Republicans. By 1828, suffrage had been given nearly all white males the right to vote in elections previously reserved for white male property owners. These new voters turned out to help Andrew Jackson defeat President John Quincy Adams.</p>
        <p>In 1860, the issue was, of course, the future of the Union as the election of Lincoln led to the secession of the Southern states and war. The McKinley-Bryan race in 1896 was the first in which big money played a major role. Big business, frightened at the prospect of electing the populist Bryan, gave more than $7 million to McKinley while Bryan was able to raise only $300,000.</p>
        <p>Twentieth-century elections gave the nation two of its most charismatic presidents, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who led the nation through the Depression and World War II as the only four-term president, and Ronald Reagan, whose 1980 election was chosen because it ushered in a new conservative era.</p>
        <p>The jewel of a museum is a perfect election-year destination. The first thing a visitor sees is a life-sized, torch-light parade of 17 uniformed Lincoln supporters known as the Hartford ''Wide Awakes.''</p>
        <p>Their parade route begins at the museum's entrance and winds down a spiral staircase to the 7,000-square-foot exhibition area, where a 10-minute film on the history of political campaigns. Included in the permanent exhibition is a 70-foot time line containing nearly a thousand banners, buttons, photographs, medallions, snuff boxes, fans, bandanas, match covers and other knicknacks from every election since George Washington's. Only a relatively small fraction of the collection can be exhibited at any given time.</p>
        <p>The nucleus of the collection was given to the university by J. Doyle DeWitt, who was president and chairman of the Travelers Insurance Company in the 1950's and 60's. Mr. DeWitt sent Travelers employees to national conventions and had insurance agents across the country on the lookout for additions to his collection. He was one of a group of Hartford citizens who founded the University of Hartford in 1959, the same year he began giving the university items from his collection. What remained went to the university on Mr. DeWitt's death in 1972, but no provision was made for housing the collection and it remained in storage for nearly two decades.</p>
        <p>It's rather appropriate that funds for the political museum finally came from a pork barrel, which  ''Safire's Political Dictionary'' defines as ''the state or national treasury into which politicians and government officials dip for 'pork' or funds for local projects.''</p>
        <p>The politician doing the dipping on behalf of the museum was Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. In 1985 he offered an amendment to a National Library Expansion Act that provided $6.5 million for the university to build a home for the DeWitt collection and the items added to it since 1972.  President Reagan put the appropriation on a list of amendments to be eliminated but Mr. Weicker, as was his custom, ignored the President's recommendation and pushed the bill through.</p>
        <p>The museum became part of a $20 million student center and opened in 1989.</p>
        <p>The Museum of American Political Life at the University of Hartford (200 Bloomfield Avenue, West Hartford; 860-768-4090) is open Tuesday to Friday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from noon to 4. It is closed Mondays and university holidays. Admission is free but contributions are appreciated.</p>
