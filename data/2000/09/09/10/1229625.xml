        <p>A JOURNEY to inland Normandy began in a promise I made myself some years ago. My brother and I were tearing through the Norman countryside in a rental car, bound for the coast: for Mont-Saint-Michel, for Bayeux and the tapestry, for the tragic beaches and Rommel's still, grim emplacements above them, for the stately strand at Deauville, for the picturesque harbor at Honfleur, for Etretat.</p>
        <p>It was spring. The countryside was decked in its best, the apple orchards a snowy blaze of blossoms, the new grasses fiercely green, wildflowers waving in a briny breeze that had scoured away winter's blackness, leaving everything washed and sharp-edged. As we drove on toward Bayeux, I caught glimpses of half-timbered buildings of such age that not one line looked plumb; window boxes bursting with flowers; farm lanes so bowered by hedgerows and trees that they wore the portent of dusk at midday; weathered, slate-steepled churches. ''O.K,'' I said to myself, ''you've got to come back here someday. All this is too marvelous simply to zip through.''</p>

        <p>A JOURNEY to inland Normandy began in a promise I made myself some years ago. My brother and I were tearing through the Norman countryside in a rental car, bound for the coast: for Mont-Saint-Michel, for Bayeux and the tapestry, for the tragic beaches and Rommel's still, grim emplacements above them, for the stately strand at Deauville, for the picturesque harbor at Honfleur, for Etretat.</p>
        <p>It was spring. The countryside was decked in its best, the apple orchards a snowy blaze of blossoms, the new grasses fiercely green, wildflowers waving in a briny breeze that had scoured away winter's blackness, leaving everything washed and sharp-edged. As we drove on toward Bayeux, I caught glimpses of half-timbered buildings of such age that not one line looked plumb; window boxes bursting with flowers; farm lanes so bowered by hedgerows and trees that they wore the portent of dusk at midday; weathered, slate-steepled churches. ''O.K,'' I said to myself, ''you've got to come back here someday. All this is too marvelous simply to zip through.''</p>
        <p>Not that the coast is to be disdained. It's too striking, as at Etretat; too historic, as at Omaha and Sword Beaches. And a Sunday spent at Trouville-sur-Mer's lively market, followed by lunch at Les Vapeurs on the waterfront and a post-prandial stroll along Deauville's boardwalk, is an experience catering to most of the important senses. Yet sampling these seaside pleasures late in the 19th century, Henry James remarked that they were of relatively recent vintage compared with the antiquity of the country inland, which had been settled by the Norsemen and where some roads are Roman.</p>
        <p>When I came back to the interior last year it was autumn, and the apple trees were yielding their bounty in red-gold piles. Spring's briny wind had died and a mellow haze hung over the landscape. Scarves of wood smoke stood above houses shielded by groves, and this time, instead of making for the coast, I marked out for a leisurely investigation a part of the country bounded by the Risle River on the east, the Dives on the west, and the town of Gace on the south. The distances involved here are not great, and so for six days, I crisscrossed what is essentially the Calvados region.</p>
        <p>One evening in Pont-Audemer at the Auberge du Vieux Puits, I told the host and  chef, Jacques Foltz, that I'd spent most of the day in the little town of Orbec. ''Ah!'' he exclaimed, ''there you have penetrated la  Normandie profonde. So often we are mad to get to Honfleur, Trouville. But Orbec, that I regard as the true Normandy.''</p>
        <p>He asked what I'd done in Orbec, and I said not much of anything, and that it had been wonderful. Instead of racing through  like an invading army, I'd wandered its little, sloping streets, strolled the beautiful park with the Orbiquet River flowing through, listened to the tinny sound of the church clock hitting the quarter hours. Down at the town square, I watched a petanque match -- about as leisurely as sport can get.</p>
        <p>After a fine lunch of oysters and veal kidneys at Au Caneton, I stepped out onto the main street and the long, low ramble of the Hotel de Croissy, a private estate, and was thrilled to find a plaque announcing that within was the garden where Debussy had composed one of his most gorgeous piano pieces, ''The Garden in the Rain.''</p>
        <p>The day I spent in Orbec, I'd intended to end in Gace but never made it. The day I intended to walk the four miles from the village of Le Grand Couliboeuf to Ammeville, I never I got there, either. The heartland of Normandy is a dense region of twisting roads and visual surprises slowly revealed, a wonderful place to get sidetracked, as I did on the way to Ammeville.</p>
        <p>I'd been walking the road between broad, flat fields bordered by copses of oaks, chestnuts and noble beeches. Tractors were turning over the earth redolent with centuries of human toil and warfare. Then at an intersection, I came upon a life-size crucified Christ raised high above a sign to Vaudeloges and followed the sign into that gem of a hamlet with its long narrow houses whose shapes whispered of the longships of the Norse, its rugged church, clustered graves and the inevitable war memorial guarded by painted shell casings. In this silent, secluded spot and with no one about in the noonday sun, I felt I could either pray or picnic -- or both.</p>
        <p>One destination I set out for and achieved was the Monday market at St.-Pierre-sur-Dives. I set out early from Pont-l'Eveque, following the Touqes River south to Lisieux, then southwest to the market. It's held at a vast 800-year-old hall whose roof was destroyed during the war, then restored using traditional chestnut pegs. The morning was brilliant and cold, the breath of the shoppers and stallkeepers hanging white in the low sun and the warmth from the chestnut vendor's little fire welcome.</p>
        <p>In the great gloom of the hall and around its outer walls, the area's farmers and fisherfolk were offering salted hams, headcheese, herring, choucroute, moules, coquilles, shrimp, sole, bar. There were apples, of course, celery root, pumpkins, pears; cages of live fowl -- turkeys, guinea hens, chickens, geese, ducks -- and rabbits, quick and not-so; and lettuce, leeks and shallots. There was a stunning profusion of cheeses (many unpasteurized), including those famed Norman varieties, Camembert, Pont-l'Eveque, and Livarot.</p>
        <p>At a butcher's stall I counted 14 kinds of sausage, and when the hearty, mustachioed proprietor saw me writing a note he said: ''Don't write. Eat,'' and cut off a hot, thick round of andouille, poking it at me on the point of his knife. To a palate trained on cheese whip and chicken-fat wienies, Norman food is often a strong surprise. Putting the round into my mouth I tasted all of the animal and its processes; it tasted like life itself instead of a mechanized simulation.</p>
        <p>By 1:30 it was all over, the vendors drinking at L'Hotel de France or Le Greenwich at the other end of the marketplace, the shoppers gone home. Only a few smashed crates and some lettuce leaves rolling over in the wind remained to suggest what an intensity of activity had been here, and looking around the deserted streets, you'd have sworn nothing had happened here since the Allies raced through in the spring of '44.</p>
        <p>On my second evening at the Auberge du Vieux Puits, I decided I had to eat more like a Norman. With Monsieur Foltz at tableside, notepad ready, I ordered duck foie gras, wild boar with stewed pears and chestnut pancakes, a cheese platter and small green salad to follow, a bottle of '96 Gigondas, and a valedictory glass of Calvados.</p>
        <p>''This is a stronger meal than you allowed yourself last night,'' Mr. Foltz said, looking over the tops of his spectacles. I said I'd been cowed by his disapproval of that previous dainty order. He smiled and said he'd been partly joking. ''But this,'' he continued, tapping the notepad, ''is a Norman meal.'' He clenched his fist. ''It will sustain you!''</p>
        <p>Indeed it did, and following his suggestions, I went off the next day in search of more regional sustenance, in the form of the region's justly famous apple brandy, Calvados. As with the Normandy cheeses imported to the United States, we simply can have no idea of the authentic article, and the Calva, as it is called here, exported by the big-time producers is a gross, inferior item, only marginally better than our old-time New England applejack.</p>
        <p>The disappearance of the small, independent Calvados maker in this Pays d'Auge region is probably a bit overstated, but there's no doubt they are far fewer than a decade ago. Nonetheless, here and there are signs pointing you to farms where it's still made the old way, and in Ste.-Foy-de-Montgommery, I followed one to the farm of M.  and Mme. Marc de Lesdain.</p>
        <p>Just down the lane, I'd read, Rommel in his staff car had been hit (but not killed) by British fighter-bombers. Two big Alsatian dogs bounded up to my car, but Madame de Lesdain was right behind, uttering reassurances, and soon enough we were seated in their parlor, where the Lesdains warmed me with samples of their product.</p>
        <p>In a reserved way, it was clear that they were proud of it, as they had every right to be. Swirling it in my glass, closing my eyes, and extending my nose into the bell of the glass, I received a vivid sense of la Normandie profonde -- the earth, the grasses, the wood and leaves of the apple trees and, of course, the fermented fruit. That and the love and skill that had gone into the making of this glorious drink that was guiding nature right into my mouth.</p>
        <p>After such generosity, I drove, a bit aimlessly, northeastward, stopping in Duranville at a roadside restaurant, thinking some food might clarify matters. I was the only customer in L'Etrier II, and the owner, Patricia Vauthier, was singing along to an opera tape. She wore a sweatshirt proclaiming affiliation with the ''University of Springfield California.'' When she produced my omelet and salad, she glanced at my notebook and asked what I was writing. I tried to explain, while complimenting her on a meal that was simple and simply delicious.</p>
        <p>She had enough English that we could have a conversation about the incursions of the fast-food purveyors, the decline of small restaurants like hers. If L'Etrier II were in Manhattan or San Francisco, I said, there would be lines outside. She appeared to consider this imagined prospect a long moment, then shook her head as if saying, non, this would not be appealing to her. For the prospect she valued was the one she already enjoyed from her window: the village church, the graves beneath the umbrageous trees. This was where she was supposed to be.</p>
        <p>From my window table, I could see her point. In fact, I had been seeing it, feeling it, for each of the splendid autumnal days I'd been granted here, in her heartland.</p>
        <p>Flavors of Normandy</p>
        <p>You can drive to Normandy in two hours from Paris, if you can find your way out of the city. It's better and saner to take the train from Gare St.-Lazare to Rouen and rent a car.</p>
        <p>Two well-situated inns offer authentic regional cuisine. Auberge du Vieux Puits, 6  rue Notre Dame-du-Pre, 27500 Pont-Audemer; (33-2) 32.41.01.48, fax (33-2) 32.42.37.28, is closed Monday and Tuesday -- except from June to mid-September in summer, when it is open for dinner -- and Dec. 17 to Jan. 26. At the exchange rate of 7.3 francs to the dollar, dinner for two with wine runs about $110, lunch about half that.</p>
        <p>At Auberge du Prieure, St. Andre d'Hebertot, 14130 Pont-l'Eveque; (33-2) 31.64.03.03, fax (33.2) 31.64.16.66, dinner for two with wine costs $100.</p>
        <p>The 17th-century Auberge du Vieux Puits has 11 rooms, some smaller and rustic and some larger and more modern. Rooms are $45 to $62. The 12 rooms at Auberge du Prieure are sparkling, spacious and absolutely quiet. They rent for $70 to $110 a night.</p>
        <p>The food at these inns, will bring you back to them for dinner, but in Trouville-sur-Mer,  visit the market (Wednesday and Sunday, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.) and have lunch adjacent at Brasserie Les Vapeurs, 160 Boulevard Fernand-Moureaux, (33-2) 31.88.15.24. Lunch or dinner for two with wine, about $60.</p>
        <p>In Orbec, Au Caneton, 32 rue Grande, (33-2) 31.32.73.32, is understated and the food is solidly traditional. Dinner for two, about $70. Closed Sunday evening and Monday, and Jan. 3 to 18.</p>
        <p>L'Etrier II, Route Nationale 13, 27230 Duranville, (33-2) 32.46.83.00, is open daily for lunch, which runs about $35 for two with wine. Open for dinner by reservation only.</p>
        <p>M. and Mme. Marc de Lesdain, le Manoir, 14140 Ste.-Foy-de-Montgommery, (33-2) 31.63.53.07, sell Calvados for $14 to $28 a bottle, depending on age.</p>
