        <p>''The gribbles are gribbling and the borers are boring,'' warned Edward Kirkland, a Chelsea resident who is concerned about a historic sunken bridge in the Hudson River off West 26th Street.</p>
        <p>The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Float Bridge is a 46-year-old wooden structure that transported rail cars from barges onto railways in Manhattan. The metal pontoons on the western end of the bridge rusted and filled with water sometime after the structure was last used in 1973, said Mr. Kirkland, who is a member of Community Board 4.</p>
        <p>The Hudson River Park Trust, with help from the state Department of Transportation, plans to lift the 46-year-old device and turn it into a boat launch. But, Mr. Kirkland said, ''The community is very much concerned that if it isn't raised soon, it will deteriorate so far that it can't be raised.''</p>
        <p>Noreen Doyle, a spokeswoman for the Hudson River Park Trust, responded, ''We hope at least to be able to get the structure out of the water this year.''</p>
        <p>Marine borers, of which the gribble is one type, are gobbling away at the wooden hulk and hastening its deterioration. The creatures were driven from the harbor as the water became more polluted, but with cleaner water they have returned.</p>
        <p>The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Float Bridge, one of dozens abandoned around the city, is unusual because it was built out of wood, long after metal replaced wood as the common building material for float bridges, according to Thomas Flagg, an industrial archaeologist. The rarity of this bridge's design made it a candidate for preservation, even though it is less than 50 years old, which is the usual minimum age for eligibility.</p>
        <p>Trucks are now the vehicles of choice for freight. But in the 1930's, there were 80 to 90 float bridges in the city, transporting about 5,000 rail cars a day, Mr. Flagg said.</p>
