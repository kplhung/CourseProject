        <p>The prime minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, took to a stage on a Little League baseball diamond on Staten Island yesterday at a rally for about 2,000 Indian-American supporters.

        <p>The prime minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, took to a stage on a Little League baseball diamond on Staten Island yesterday at a rally for about 2,000 Indian-American supporters. He spoke for about an hour, and in American political lingo, he seemed to succeed in pleasing his base.</p>
        <p>Speaking slowly in Hindi, and remaining seated because of arthritis in his knees, Mr. Vajpayee, 75, began by praising the recently concluded Millennium Summit at the United Nations, in which he and more than 150 other government leaders took part. And with about 50 Hindu clerics occupying another stage to his right, he told the audience of immigrants that they could be particularly proud of India for its policy of religious tolerance.</p>
        <p>Both remarks had controversial undertones.</p>
        <p>At the summit meeting last week, Mr. Vajpayee criticized Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, for telling leaders at the United Nations that ''the people of Kashmir remain deprived of justice.'' The largely Hindu India and the predominantly Muslim Pakistan have disputed ownership of Kashmir since both gained independence in 1947.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Vajpayee's turn came to address the summit meeting, he reinforced India's claim that the current Kashmiri separatist movement relied on terrorism and support from Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Coming on the heels of that dispute, yesterday's event drew about 50 Pakistani-American demonstrators, who stood behind police barricades and held signs that read, ''Indian Forces Out of Kashmir'' and ''Don't Lie, Vajpayee.''</p>
        <p>Bindu Doshi, a 41-year-old social worker from Flushing, Queens, who came dressed in a purple sari, said she, too, came to hear about Kashmir. ''I'm interested to know how the prime minister is going to tackle the terrorism that is going on there,'' she said. She added that she had tried to speak about the issue to the demonstrators, but a police officer separated them when discussion became too heated.</p>
        <p>And the prime minister's expressions of support for religious tolerance in India were not as simple as they may have seemed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vajpayee presides over a 24-party coalition government as the leader of the Bharatiya Janata party. Keeping that coalition together for two years has not been easy, said Prakash Parekh, the executive editor of News India, a New York-based English-language magazine on Indian affairs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parekh said in an interview yesterday that Mr. Vajpayee's moderation on religious issues has made him ''tremendously popular amongst Americans of Indian origin,'' while rankling some coalition members whose parties have strong religious affiliations.</p>
        <p>But among those who came to hear him, there seemed to be little but enthusiasm for the prime minister. The crowd was primed for his entrance with upbeat ragas played on a sound system and a cleric who led a rousing chant of ''victory to Mother India.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vajpayee entered to a standing ovation from the well-appointed crowd, which remained standing through renditions of the American and Indian national anthems.</p>
        <p>Shefali Asthana, a recent graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said she came from Boston for ''the great honor'' of hearing Mr. Vajpayee speak. ''Growing up, I've always been taught that India is the mother of my heritage,'' she said. ''I am here because he represents that, and not so much for the politics.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Vajpayee's visit to Staten Island drew a crowd yesterday, he has been to the borough many times before on less high-profile visits. He is a friend of Mukund Mody, a rally organizer who lives in Todt Hill, not far from South Beach, where the Little League baseball field is located.</p>
        <p>The rally concluded with a fund-raising dinner for several hundred supporters under an enormous tent. Navtej Sarna, a spokesman at the Indian Embassy in Washington, said the rally was the only large public event scheduled during the prime minister's 10-day visit to the United States, which concludes on Sept. 17 with a state dinner at the White House. He said Mr. Vajpayee is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress on Sept. 14, followed the next day by ''full-scale bilateral talks'' with President Clinton.</p>
