        <p>MOBY  Electronica artist</p>
        <p>I'VE heard Madonna's new single, ''Music,'' and really like it a lot. I think it's one of the better things she's done in a long time. I've always considered myself a Madonna fan, but I think of her more as sort of a singles artist rather than an album artist. On her last one, some of the songs were really nice. There's one song in particular I really liked a lot, ''Substitute for Love.'' But I really do like ''Music.'' It's great.</p>
        <p>I'd be curious to hear PJ Harvey's new album. Some of the stuff she's done has been sublime, some has been mediocre. I thought that her record ''To Bring You My Love'' was phenomenal. It was dark and emotional, the production was really interesting, and the songs on the one hand were very foreboding, on the other very intimate. The album after that left me kind of cold. But as an artist I'd be really curious to hear what she's doing. She's one of the people that makes the world of pop music an interesting place to be.</p>

But as an artist I'd be really curious to hear what she's doing. She's one of the people that makes the world of pop music an interesting place to be.</p>
        <p>I'd also be very interested to hear Marilyn Manson. He's just a really interesting public figure. I'd be curious to see how he reinvents himself for this record.</p>
        <p>MOS DEF  Rapper</p>
        <p>I'M really, really, really looking forward to the Wu-Tang Clan album. I have no idea what it's going to be like, and that's part of the excitement.</p>
        <p>The Wu is an inspiration to everybody, whether they want to admit it or not. They broke all the rules. Sonically, nobody made songs like that before them. Those long choruses, choruses that could have been the first eight bars to someone's verse. And the fact that it's this whole massive movement. Before them there was no rap group with eight members. It was ridiculous. There was no hip-hop vocal octet. In the music industry orthodox, they're supposed to be a marginal, cult favorite type of group. They're not supposed to be as big as they are.</p>
        <p>I also want to hear L. L. Cool J.'s new record. He says it's his best record to date, and that's a pretty strong statement coming from the guy who made ''Mama Said Knock You Out,'' which in my opinion is one of the best albums ever recorded in hip-hop, and arguably in pop music in general. He's one of those rare things in pop, an undeniable pop icon who still has a real strong name on the streets. And lyrically he's still very much on top of his game.</p>
        <p>But Outkast is the record I'm looking forward to the most. I'm going to tell you why. There's no MC more underrated than Andre Benjamin. He's a prodigious talent. He is formidable in his faculty.</p>
        <p>JASON MORAN  Jazz pianist</p>
        <p>HENRY Threadgill is coming to town this week. He's playing at the Knitting Factory with a new group called ZOOID. I regard him as one of the most prolific composers around, and especially in terms of creative, improvised music, he's definitely leagues ahead of most composers. So anytime you get to be in the presence of a master like him, you need to take advantage of it. Repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Also, De La Soul is working on a three-part series, and I'm looking forward to the second one. They're calling the series ''Art Official Intelligence,'' and I think that's a suitable title for them. They're one of the pioneers. They've never been into the hype that a lot of other rappers are. They never talk about the cars and the glamour and the glitz. They talk about things that are meaningful to them. It's just not about guns and robbing people and shooting people and running away from cops. It's more of a party vibe. I saw them a couple of months ago, and they just blew up the place.</p>
        <p>I just got the performance schedule for the Brooklyn Academy of Music and there's a lot of things there I'm looking forward to. There's the Jimi Hendrix tribute, there's a Philip Glass thing, and there's ''A Dream Play,'' that Robert Wilson is directing. That looks interesting.</p>
        <p>ROBERT BROWNING  Artistic director of World Music  Institute, New York</p>
        <p>ONE thing I'm really looking forward to is the Manipuri group that is going to be at BAM in October, a very unusual Indian dance and theater event. There are 30 or 40 members in this group, apparently, and this is stuff that is virtually never seen here. You see Indian classical music and dance, but you very rarely see folk dance, which is what is associated with this group.</p>
        <p>I've also heard about a collaboration between Arif Sag, a Turkish tanbur, or lute, player, and the flamenco guitarist Tomatito. This will be at Symphony Space on Dec. 3. I don't know a lot about it, but I think it will probably be very interesting. Sag is a wildly big artist in Turkey. He plays a fairly small instrument in a kind of flailing style with all his fingers, so it kind of fits into flamenco in a way.</p>
        <p>BEN HARPER  Singer and guitarist</p>
        <p>YOU can pen me in for the Radiohead release. I'm over the moon about that. ''OK Computer'' remains in constant rotation on our tour bus. Expectations are high, but how can they not be high with such great music? Radiohead's music sets a standard: the greater the music, the greater the expectations. That's just a constant that you've got to live up to in this business.</p>
        <p>A band that you have not heard of -- but you will -- is Wan Santo Cando, from Austin, Tex. They're a cross between Jeff Buckley and Soundgarden. They're extraordinary. I was on the Horde tour in Austin last year, and a guy was driving myself and the band said, ''Would you mind if I put in my band's CD for you to hear?'' And I'm thinking to myself, ''Well, kind of!'' Because I'm about to go onstage. But something kicks me in the butt and says, ''Man, let this kid play you his CD.'' And he throws it in and I'm then plastered to the back of my seat and just floored by this guy's band. They've got a done record. It's just a matter of working out the particulars to get it released.</p>
        <p>Alvin Youngblood Hart's new record is just the bomb. He's been opening up for us, and he'll be touring this fall. Great player, great singer. He could be called a traditionalist, but if you close your eyes you can hear Cream, Fillmore, 60-whatever. He mixes it way up between Delta and straight-up power-trio rock. He does a wicked version of ''Stone Free,'' actually.</p>
        <p>ELLIOTT SMITH  Singer and songwriter</p>
        <p>THERE'S really only one thing that I'm looking forward to this fall. It's an E.P. by this band called the Minders. They're from Portland, Ore., where I used to live. It's called ''Down in Fall'' and it's coming out in October on the spinART label.</p>
        <p>They're one of my favorite bands. They opened up for me the last few months. They're really melodic, very British-sounding. Kind of psychedelic, kind of fast British Invasion pop music. They're taking pages from times other than right now. Most people's opinion seems to be that if you're not playing whatever kind of music is selling millions of copies right now, that they don't like it. Which is too bad. Because if people would listen to more different kinds of things, they wouldn't get sick of hearing the same things and then have to trash it six months later.</p>
        <p>CORY ROONEY  Producer</p>
        <p>I KNOW the Ricky Martin project is going to be very, very exciting. Everybody's wondering: 'What's he going to do now? How can he top last year?' I've been hearing bits and pieces of it, and I know it's going to shock everyone.</p>
        <p>I'm excited about the L. L. Cool J. project. I've heard the whole record, and this is going to be incredible. This guy's has been in it so long, and he's always found a way to reinvent himself. He's worked with a guy named Benny James Anthony. He took L. and stayed consistent with the smooth R-and-B sound, but he gave him a little rough edge this time around. It's like an R-and-B record but a little more street.</p>
