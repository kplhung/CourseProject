        <p>Pedro Martinez's fingers are not fat enough to fill the holes in the Fenway Park dike. Not even he can halt the flood that threatens to sweep the Red Sox out of playoff contention.</p>
        <p>Martinez was his marvelous self for six innings yesterday, but before he slipped in the seventh, his teammates had not been there for him. They had not provided him with the equilibrium he needed to steady himself on the ice-covered slope that was a three-run home run by Scott Brosius.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox simply had not been able to fare much better against Andy Pettitte in the first six innings than the Yankees had against Martinez. One run was all Pettitte allowed in the eight innings he pitched. Last-inning runs for both teams made it 5-3, the Yankees' second straight victory in what will be a four-game confrontation with the Red Sox.</p>
        <p>This is the team that a national magazine picked in the spring to win the World Series? This is the team that other supposedly knowledgeable observers picked to win the American League East and the pennant? This is the team that was supposed to beat the Yankees? Well, roses bloom in the spring and fade in the fall, too.</p>
        <p>The only way the Red Sox could beat the Yankees would be as the wild-card team in the League Championship Series. But even there, the Red Sox suffered a setback yesterday, falling three games behind the wild-card leader, the Cleveland Indians, who defeated the Chicago White Sox. The Red Sox have lagged more than three games off the wild-card pace before, but that was a month ago.</p>
        <p>Now they have only three weeks and 23 games left. Eight of those games are with the Indians, but to make up the three-game deficit in that series they would have to win six of the eight. ''I'm not going to tell you we're going to catch up with the Yankees,'' Martinez said, ''but none of the other guys are far away from us. Name one that's three games ahead of us.''</p>
        <p>The Indians.</p>
        <p>''The Indians,'' he said. ''Who else? Nobody else. Three games? We play them. We have plenty of games to beat them. We beat them three in a row in the playoffs, didn't we?''</p>
        <p>Does last year count this year? ''No,'' the pitcher said resignedly, ''we've got to start over.''</p>
        <p>Starting over after yesterday's loss could be difficult. The Red Sox cannot afford to lose when Martinez starts. When Brosius stepped into the batter's box in the seventh inning, the Yankees had two runners on and two out. At that moment, Boston opponents were batting .167 against Martinez; .120 with runners in scoring position; and .121 with runners in scoring position and two out.</p>
        <p>Pedro's earned run average for the season was 1.60. He had allowed fewer than three runs in 19 of his 25 starts, fewer than three earned runs in 20 of those starts. What chance did Brosius really have?</p>
        <p>''I threw him two good changeups and he swung and missed,'' Martinez said. ''I missed with the fastball, missed with the cutter. I came back with the cutter in a 2-2 count and I thought I had a strikeout.''</p>
        <p>But Fieldin Culbreth, who joined the American League umpiring staff last season, called the cut fastball the third ball. Brosius concurred. ''I thought everything I saw from 0-2 on was away,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Martinez begged to differ, though not vociferously.</p>
        <p>''I went and looked at the video,'' he said, ''and it looked to me like I had a strikeout, especially that deep in the game, doing it as consistently as I had the whole game. I hit that corner with the fastball and the cutter. I thought I should have gotten that pitch, but the umpire is human. You can't blame him for that. You have to be able to make another pitch and get him out.''</p>
        <p>For that pitch, Martinez selected a changeup.</p>
        <p>''The previous two changes he swung and missed,'' Martinez explained. ''I said if I'm going to die with something, I might as well die with something I made him look bad. He didn't even foul them off. He swung over it. I was hoping I could get the same result.''</p>
        <p>Changeup was in the back of Brosius' mind for the same reason, because he had looked so bad on the first two. When he swung at this changeup, Martinez figured Brosius was waiting for it. ''If fastball crosses your mind one time,'' Martinez said, ''you swing ahead of it.''</p>
        <p>Martinez didn't blame Culbreth for the loss; far from it. But he did lament what he perceived as a change in umpiring styles.</p>
        <p>''I was in the National League for seven years,'' he said. ''If you were a veteran like Maddux and Glavine, if you were hitting the corner, even it if was one, two, three inches out and you're hitting it in a consistent way and you're old enough to know what you're doing and the umpire knew you were doing that on a consistent basis, they would give it to you at certain times. That's how it used to be. Now you never know.''</p>
        <p>Then, speaking of the umpire, he added: ''In tight situations like that, you have to think that this could mean the whole season for this team, this one game, this one pitch. So you have to keep your focus on the game. But I don't blame him. We're all human.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees don't necessarily see Martinez as human. Joe Torre, their manager, made it clear after the game that he would be very happy to see the Red Sox fail to reach the playoffs. Encountering a weapon like Martinez in a short series, he suggested, could be very hazardous to a team's health.</p>
