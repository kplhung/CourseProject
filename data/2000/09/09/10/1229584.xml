        <p>ONE GOOD TURN</p>
        <p>A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw.</p>
        <p>By Witold Rybczynski.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 173 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Scribner. $22.</p>
        <p>Relocated, serendipitously, to a makeshift office in my workshop, I contemplate this book about screwdrivers while surrounded by them. Eleven hang on the Pegboard, five more hide in the toolbox, and, counting all the devices for turning screws, including Allen wrenches and bits for that finest of all turnscrews, the Chapman wrench, I have more than 50 ways to drive screws. This is not a fetish. A friend has 172 handsaws -- that is something to worry about. In a complex world, a few dozen screwdrivers are no luxury in themselves, although perhaps the sign of an excess of possessions. Almost anything in the world worth owning is held together with screws.</p>
        <p>Witold Rybczynski, a professor of urban studies at the University of Pennsylvania, has written several books, including the marvelously discursive ''The Most Beautiful House in the World,'' a book that describes Rybczynski's construction of his house with his own hands and hand tools. It also manages to discuss the history of the art of divination done by examining freshly slaughtered livers (hepatoscopy), just one among many, mostly amusing, digressions.</p>
        <p>Rybczynski turned his attention to the screwdriver for the usual reason -- the promise of a moderate sum, this in return for a modest essay on the ''Most Useful Tool of the Millennium,'' printed in a Y2K supplement to The New York Times. For journalism, tracing the screwdriver back to 18th-century France (when the word tournevis, literally ''turnscrew,'' first appears in print) sufficed. But Rybczynski wanted to know, as the reader might also be wondering, how long had the screw existed before it arrived on the printed page, and where, and for what, was it invented?</p>
        <p>Given that the screwdriver really is a boy toy, the answer is not surprising. The two earliest uses Rybczynski could locate were to assemble bits and pieces of suits of armor and, more deviously, to attach the matchlock firing mechanism to the wooden stocks of the earliest firearms.</p>
        <p>At that point, less than midway through the book, begin the fascinating digressions. The threads of a screw, Rybczynski explains, form a helix, not a spiral. That is, they revolve about the axis of the screw (or bolt) equidistantly from the center while spirals expand out from the axis. (Rybczynski overstates the case a little: the first threads on a tapered wood screw are a spiral, moving away from the axis until they become a helix for the remainder of the shaft.) Once the helix becomes the subject, Rybczynski is off and running, all the way back to classical and Hellenistic Greece, where the principle of the helix was elucidated by mathematicians and applied to devices both ingenious (a primitive odometer) and practical (a helical water pump invented in Alexandria, and used to lift the Nile into irrigation ditches).</p>
        <p>The beauty of the helix, when used as part of a machine, is that it allows for very precise adjustments and move-ments. The office chair that raises and lowers as we twirl it is perhaps the most frequently used helical adjustment out-side of a machine shop. The bottom of almost every refrigerator has helix-mounted feet for leveling the appliance, a one-time application unless the house starts to tilt (or unless the house is in California).</p>
        <p>Rybczynski argues convincingly that the application of helical adjustment is one of the core principles of the Industrial Revolution. The metal-turning lathe, first invented (believe it or not) to mass-produce screws in the 1700's, allowed the manufacture of all kinds of precisely sized parts for everything from steam engines to chronometers. Refinements in machine tools in the 19th century allowed the mass production of interchangeable parts for consumer goods and articles of war. The rifling inside a gun barrel (the grooving that imparts spin, and thus gyroscopic stability to the bullet) is a helix, and the machine that rifles the barrel is controlled by helical devices.</p>
        <p>What Rybczynski sees is that everything that requires mechanical precision, and that includes the instrumentation of modern science, rises out of the perfection of the simple screw and the complex machinery required to manufacture these indispensable items. He notes at the conclusion of the book that science (sometimes self-deprecatingly or self-consciously called ''Western science'') did not develop in cultures unfamiliar with the screw. In China, for example, where astrology did not evolve into astronomy or alchemy into chemistry, he writes, ''They didn't know screws at all: the screw is the only major mechanical device that they did not independently invent.''</p>
        <p>To extend the argument further than Rybczynski takes it, the great achievement of the millennium -- the discovery and decoding of the double helix of life, the geometry of the genome itself -- could not occur without the application of the single helix in the manufacture and operation of scientific instrumentation. That includes the</p>
        <p>X-ray microscope that first revealed the helixes inside us all.</p>
        <p>The screwdriver, to regress to the subject, will probably be the last common hand tool in this increasingly digital world. The computer technicians in our offices have one on them at all times. It has a clip on it and lives inside a pocket protector, nestled by the ballpoint pen and the mechanical (usually helix-driven) pencil.</p>
