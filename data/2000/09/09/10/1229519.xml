        <p>One man was killed and four other people were wounded last night when two gunmen opened fire on a car parked near an intersection in Newark, the police and witnesses said.</p>
        <p>In what appeared to be a drug deal setup, two young men carrying guns rode on mountain bicycles up to a late-model green Honda Civic about 9 p.m., said two witnesses who declined to give their names for fear of retribution. The car, which had five people in it, was parked on Fourth Avenue near Roseville Avenue.</p>
        <p>The two men opened fire, and the people in the car scrambled to get out, the witnesses said. One man fell face first to the sidewalk with a bullet wound to the head. Last night, after the shootings, he lay on the ground. The gunmen rode off on their bikes, the witnesses said.</p>
        <p>The other four victims were taken to University Hospital and were in stable condition last night, a police official said. The police declined to identify the dead man pending notification of his family, and did not identify the other victims.</p>
        <p>The police were still looking for the gunmen last night. Search dogs were brought to the scene after midnight. About 20 onlookers stood gazing at the bullet-riddled car.</p>
        <p>The shooting took place in a middle-class neighborhood of low-slung row houses and apartment buildings.</p>
