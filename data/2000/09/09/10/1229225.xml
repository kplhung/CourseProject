        <p>FUNNY how the city can involve you in the life of a stranger and then leave you to forget, catch the 6:15 express and return to your exurban lair. Or challenge you to help in any way you can. Regard this story of rarefied love.</p>
        <p>Three members of a family waited near me during a recent afternoon rush hour for the Lexington Avenue subway local to rumble into the station in lower Manhattan and begin its journey to Grand Central Terminal and beyond.</p>
        <p>A beautiful, black-eyed boy of about 3 in a stroller was tolerating the adoring ministrations of his mother, a plain-looking woman who alternately stroked his mop of dark hair with her palm or leaned into his stroller with a look that said, ''God has indeed blessed me with this wonderful creature.''</p>
        <p>Holding on to the stroller arm was his sister, a pretty, slender girl of 8 or so. When it occurred to him, the boy slapped his sister with the side of his fist and looked up at her for a reaction, which was forbearance and a kind of sweet magnanimity.</p>
        <p>The train arrived, and I stepped aside to allow the family to enter. The mother nodded a cautious thanks, boarded and arranged her children for the ride. The boy gave the girl another swipe, and I stopped watching, feeling this little tableau was over.</p>
        <p>How wrong I was.</p>
        <p>At the Spring Street stop, a tall, striking woman of about 40 boarded and sat down directly across from the family. She looked like an executive, spent by a day of order giving and decision making. Her streaked yellow hair was parted in the middle and brushed dramatically back. She wore a deep blue linen suit, the skirt exposing much of her long, athletic legs. Many of the eyes in the car, including mine, turned to admire her.</p>
        <p>But concerns that she would catch us staring and shoot back a withering New York look telling us to turn away were baseless. She had eyes only for the little dark-haired boy.</p>
        <p>She smiled across at him. Her face in repose was lovely; when she smiled, her looks were riveting. I looked down the car at the little boy. He became aware of the woman and stared back at her, then gave his sister another tap. The woman's pale blue eyes grew larger as she conveyed to the little boy her wonderment. She cocked her head, alternately grinning at him and looking hurt and bemused over his indifference.</p>
        <p>Then she leaned forward, thrust up her face and moved her head delicately from side to side as though she and he were rubbing noses. Her face revealed as much pleasure as if she were actually involved in a cozy nuzzle.</p>
        <p>Several other passengers became aware of the woman's animated behavior, if not her captivation by the little boy, but soon lost interest. One person who did not was the little boy's mother. She became alarmed by this unexpected and unwanted flood of affection aimed at her beloved son.</p>
        <p>Her manner was meek, but she began glaring at the woman to stop. The beautiful woman, however, was either oblivious to the mother or too taken with her son to notice and continued to deliver to the boy a repertory of flirtation and reverence.</p>
        <p>Eventually, I, too, stopped watching. As the train approached my stop at 42nd Street, I peered across the car for one last look. The woman and the family were both gone. The moment was over, except I couldn't get it out of my head.</p>
        <p>An hour later, I was at home in Westchester County, and when I realized that there was enough daylight left, I quickly changed and headed into the well-trailed woods of the Rockefeller estate. Arriving after 15 minutes at a hilltop that looks across to Rockland County, I paused under an old oak, which has been named the Prayer Tree by my family and friends.</p>
        <p>As I always do, I looked up at the Prayer Tree and beyond and thanked God for His protection and guidance. But this evening, I added a special prayer: Dear God, please bring the beautiful woman the baby she deserves.</p>
