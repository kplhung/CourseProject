        <p>September</p>
        <p>* ''ALMOST FAMOUS''  The director Cameron Crowe's first film since ''Jerry Maguire'' is the semiautobiographical story, set in 1973, of his days as a fledgling rock journalist. Against the wishes of his stern mother (Frances McDormand), the chipper, downy-cheeked hero (Patrick Fugit, a newcomer) goes on the road with Stillwater, a fictional Detroit rock band, to chronicle its drug trips and internal power struggles for Rolling Stone. Kate Hudson is an incandescent groupie named Penny Lane, and Billy Crudup plays Stillwater's charismatic guitarist. Compared with Oliver Stone's frenzied Dionysian visions of the rock world, Mr. Crowe's 70's rock memories may be tender, rose-colored and unabashedly nostalgic. Opens Wednesday.

        <p>''CHUTNEY POPCORN''  The serious comedy by Nisha Ganatra examines the complications when an Indian-American lesbian decides to have a baby for her infertile sister. Homophobia, culture shock, single parenthood and cultural assimilation are among the themes treated lightly. Sept. 22.</p>

        <p>* ''DANCER IN THE DARK''  Lars von Trier's controversial ''musical,'' with songs by the Icelandic pop singer Bjork (who also stars), won two top awards at the Cannes Film Festival but was reviled by more than one American critic. The movie, which opens the New York Film Festival, could turn out to be the ''The Rite of Spring'' of film musicals by dividing audiences into cheering and booing sections. Set in rural America in 1964, it is the Danish director's third film in which the leading character is martyred. Bjork plays a Czech expatriate factory worker who is going blind and dreams of playing Maria von Trapp in a local production of ''The Sound of Music.'' The highly choreographed song and dance numbers, with locations as different as a railroad station and a courtroom, are her childlike fantasies. Iconoclastic, to say the least. Sept. 23. A related article is on Page 53.</p>

The canine names (like Rhapsody in White, a poodle nicknamed Butch) say it all. If it's only half as funny as ''Guffman,'' it will still be a winner. With Mr. Guest, Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy, Fred Willard and Parker Posey. Sept. 29.</p>
        <p>''BROKEN HEARTS CLUB: A ROMANTIC COMEDY''  The personal struggles of a group of gay men in West Hollywood, lightly done. With Timothy Olyphant and Dean Cain. Sept. 29.</p>

        <p>October</p>
        <p>''BAMBOOZLED''  Spike Lee's edgy, satirical race comedy stars Damon Wayans as a television writer so desperate for a hit that he conceives a contemporary minstrel show -- and the network eats it up like candy.

        <p>''BOOTMEN''  A young steelworker in Newcastle, Australia, determined to break the pattern of his family's life, becomes a tap dancer. Directed by Dein Perry. With Adam Garcia. Oct. 6. A related article is on Page 69.</p>

They skid downhill into despair and delusions. Oct. 6. A related article is on Page 68.</p>
        <p>''TWO FAMILY HOUSE''  In this low-key drama set in 1950's Staten Island, an enterprising Italian-American (Michael Rispoli) dreams of opening a nightclub on the first floor of his shabby two-family home.

A related article is on Page 50.</p>
        <p>''THE CONTENDER''  Rod Lurie's drama, which has strong advance word of mouth, stars Joan Allen as a popular senator whose nomination for vice president is thrown into doubt by a looming sex scandal. With Jeff Bridges, Christian Slater and Gary Oldman. Oct. 13.</p>

        <p>* ''CASTAWAY''  If there's such a thing as a sure bet in Hollywood, Robert Zemeckis's film has got to be it. America's favorite Everyman, Tom Hanks, plays a FedEx worker, presumed dead when his plane crashes in the Pacific, surviving on a desert island. The star shed 50 pounds to play this contemporary Robinson Crusoe, whose struggle to stay alive is harrowing. Think ''Survivor'' meets ''Forrest Gump'' but heavier.

George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson play escaped prisoners from a chain gang in the Depression-era South in the Coen brothers' homage to Preston Sturges's ''Sullivan's Travels.''

        <p>''MOULIN ROUGE''  Baz Luhrmann, who reinvented Shakespeare for the MTV  generation with ''Romeo and Juliet,'' tries to salvage the movie musical with this trippy, beat-driven fantasy of the world of Toulouse-Lautrec. Ewan McGregor is a rebellious young poet who goes boho with a vengeance and moves to Montmartre. Nicole Kidman is the Moulin Rouge's star courtesan, and John Leguizamo is Toulouse-Lautrec. Traditionalists will no doubt be outraged at the use of contemporary music in a period setting. Dec. 25 .</p>
        <p>''SLACKERS''  Three buddies are happily scamming their way through college when the campus geek catches on to their schemes. Dec. 25</p>

Kate Hudson is an incandescent groupie named Penny Lane, and Billy Crudup plays Stillwater's charismatic guitarist.

        <p>* ''DANCER IN THE DARK''  Lars von Trier's controversial ''musical,'' with songs by the Icelandic pop singer Bjork (who also stars), won two top awards at the Cannes Film Festival but was reviled by more than one American critic. The movie, which opens the New York Film Festival, could turn out to be the ''The Rite of Spring'' of film musicals by dividing audiences into cheering and booing sections. Set in rural America in 1964, it is the Danish director's third film in which the leading character is martyred. Bjork plays a Czech expatriate factory worker who is going blind and dreams of playing Maria von Trapp in a local production of ''The Sound of Music.'' The highly choreographed song and dance numbers, with locations as different as a railroad station and a courtroom, are her childlike fantasies. Iconoclastic, to say the least. Sept. 23.

        <p>* ''CHOCOLAT''  Glowing word of mouth precedes the newest film from Lasse Hallstrom (''The Cider House Rules''). In this surreally tinged fable, set in 1959, Juliette Binoche is a mysterious single mother who appears and scandalizes a straitlaced French village by opening a chocolate shop (whose treats are irresistible) across the square from a church. Johnny Depp is another outsider who appears and joins forces with her to liberate the town from domination by its prudish self-appointed leader (Alfred Molina). A Gallic ''Babette's Feast''? Dec. 15.

        <p>''THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE''  The newest animated comedy from Disney is a buddy movie set in South America and tells of an arrogant young emperor who is turned into a llama but finds his humanity after teaming up with a friendly peasant. With the voices of David Spade, Eartha Kitt and John Goodman. God forbid it should resemble that other animated buddy movie ''The Road to El Dorado.'' Dec. 15.</p>
        <p>''FAMILY MAN''  In the newest example of a what-if genre that echoes ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and ''Peggy Sue Got Married,'' Nicolas Cage is a Wall Street playboy who discovers how his life would have turned out had he married the college sweetheart (Tea Leoni) he dumped to pursue his career.

        <p>* ''CASTAWAY''  If there's such a thing as a sure bet in Hollywood, Robert Zemeckis's film has got to be it. America's favorite Everyman, Tom Hanks, plays a FedEx worker, presumed dead when his plane crashes in the Pacific, surviving on a desert island. The star shed 50 pounds to play this contemporary Robinson Crusoe, whose struggle to stay alive is harrowing. Think ''Survivor'' meets ''Forrest Gump'' but heavier. Helen Hunt is the girlfriend left behind who assumes he is dead. Dec. 22</p>

George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson play escaped prisoners from a chain gang in the Depression-era South in the Coen brothers' homage to Preston Sturges's ''Sullivan's Travels.'' The story is also (very loosely) based on Homer's ''Odyssey.'' The quirky film, which was well received at Cannes, should test Mr. Clooney's box office clout after ''The Perfect Storm.'' Dec. 22.</p>

        <p>''MOULIN ROUGE''  Baz Luhrmann, who reinvented Shakespeare for the MTV  generation with ''Romeo and Juliet,'' tries to salvage the movie musical with this trippy, beat-driven fantasy of the world of Toulouse-Lautrec. Ewan McGregor is a rebellious young poet who goes boho with a vengeance and moves to Montmartre. Nicole Kidman is the Moulin Rouge's star courtesan, and John Leguizamo is Toulouse-Lautrec. Traditionalists will no doubt be outraged at the use of contemporary music in a period setting. Dec. 25 .</p>
        <p>''SLACKERS''  Three buddies are happily scamming their way through college when the campus geek catches on to their schemes. Dec. 25</p>
