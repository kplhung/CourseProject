        <p>The Federal Trade Commission plans to release a report on Monday that harshly criticizes the film, recording and video game industries for marketing violent, adult-rated entertainment to young people, said several officials familiar with the report.</p>
        <p>The report concludes that, despite voluntary rating and labeling systems adopted over the years, all three industries have used marketing strategies to entice young consumers to buy products that the industries themselves deem inappropriate. They do this largely, the report contends, by placing advertising in publications and television broadcasts that appeal to youth.</p>
        <p>In its recommendations, the commission does not call for legislative remedies or tougher regulation, which could run afoul of First Amendment protections of free speech.</p>
        <p>But the report does call on the entertainment industry to adopt stringent policies -- including the threat of sanctions -- that would prohibit the marketing of violent movies, recordings and video games to children. The officials said the report encourages the industry not to advertise on television programs that are popular with children under 16 or in time slots when they are most likely to watch.</p>
        <p>It also calls on producers and retailers to better educate the public about their rating and labeling systems. Individual retailers, it says, should enact rules, like those adopted recently by Kmart, Wal-Mart and Toys ''R'' Us, that prohibit the sale of mature-rated video games to anyone under 17. The report also recommends that the industry not market to children any action figure from R-rated movies or M-rated video games.</p>
        <p>While the report was tightly held this weekend, some on Capitol Hill said they had been informed of its essential thrust.</p>
        <p>''There has been an ongoing, knowing, systematic marketing of adult-rated products to an underage audience,'' said Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican who called for the investigation. ''It's along the lines of how Joe Camel is marketed to children.''</p>
        <p>Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has also been active on the issue, said, ''They are going to find that there has been a conscious targeting of children with violent media content.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton requested the review more than a year ago in the aftermath of the massacre by two teenagers at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., and after other school shootings where the assailants were thought to be desensitized to violence.</p>
        <p>Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the trade commission, will release the report and hold a news conference on Monday morning. President Clinton plans to comment on the findings at an event in Westchester County, N.Y., later that day.</p>
        <p>And on Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which is led by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, will hold a hearing on the report. Among those scheduled to testify are Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee and a longtime crusader against the marketing of sex and violence.</p>
        <p>A number of industry leaders are also expected to testify, though many top film studio executives have thus far declined to attend, according to committee aides. The entertainment industry has been jockeying with Washington for years over violent content. Some members of Congress, including Mr. Lieberman, have threatened stricter regulation while industry leaders have argued that no other business has so constrained its own sales by agreeing to voluntary ratings and labeling.</p>
        <p>The officials who are familiar with the report said that much of the most damning information came from the industry's own files. The trade commission analyzed marketing plans for a number of adult-rated products and found evidence that advertising strategies were devised at least partly with youngsters in mind, they said.</p>
        <p>Of the R-rated movies that were studied, nearly two-thirds had marketing plans that included children who are not supposed to see the films without a parent, the officials said. Of the M-rated video games studied, more than half had such plans. For recordings with parental advisory labels, the figure was about a quarter.</p>
        <p>The commission also found that retailers -- whether movie theaters or video game stores -- do not always pay much attention to ratings. Mounting an undercover operation using youngsters under 17, the commission found that the children could obtain tickets to R-rated movies about half of the time they tried. About 85 percent of the time, the children were able to buy M-rated video games, which the industry has determined are suitable only for those 17 or older.</p>
        <p>Eric London, a spokesman for the trade commission, declined to confirm the details of the report. But, he said, ''This report goes far beyond percentages and the most interesting part is some of the evidence based on the industry documents.''</p>
        <p>Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, said he had not read the report but resented the obvious analogy to the government's treatment of the tobacco industry.</p>
        <p>''Tobacco kills people,'' he said. ''And tobacco is not protected by the First Amendment. I don't want us grouped with tobacco and that's what these recommendations do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Valenti said that children have such pervasive access to television that it would be difficult, and unfair, to restrict advertising to times when youngsters would not see it. ''I have no doubt that our companies have made mistakes in the past,'' he said, ''but to make the leap from a trampoline and say that it's the policy of our companies is outrageous.''</p>
        <p>Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association, said surveys show that most video game players are over 18, and that 90 percent of those who buy video and computer games are adults. Therefore, it is the responsibility of parents, he said, to pay attention to the violence ratings the industry has imposed on its members.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lowenstein said his group had recently formed an advertising review council to monitor and police industry practices, and that it does not condone the marketing of mature-rated videos to underage consumers. But, he said, ''recommendations that put the government in the position of regulating people's access to content is something we would be deeply troubled by.''</p>
