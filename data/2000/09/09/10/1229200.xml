        <p>SINCE 1992, when Toll Brothers, one of the country's largest developers, began building in Connecticut, it has combined the deep pockets and resources of a publicly owned company with a determination to avoid uniformity in its developments, a strategy that has allowed it to become an imposing presence in the state's higher-end residential market.</p>
        <p>''They came into the state when the market was down and bought up a lot of distressed properties,'' said William Raveis, chairman of William Raveis Real Estate, based in Shelton. Noting that the company had gone public in 1986, he added, ''They had the entire state to themselves and hundreds of millions of dollars in cash from the stock market.''</p>

        <p>SINCE 1992, when Toll Brothers, one of the country's largest developers, began building in Connecticut, it has combined the deep pockets and resources of a publicly owned company with a determination to avoid uniformity in its developments, a strategy that has allowed it to become an imposing presence in the state's higher-end residential market.</p>
        <p>''They came into the state when the market was down and bought up a lot of distressed properties,'' said William Raveis, chairman of William Raveis Real Estate, based in Shelton. Noting that the company had gone public in 1986, he added, ''They had the entire state to themselves and hundreds of millions of dollars in cash from the stock market.''</p>
        <p>Saying that the company was outstanding in what he called ''the product for the price, the square footage and the response of the marketplace,'' he added, ''The proof is in the pudding; the houses sell.''</p>
        <p>To date the company has built or has under construction 634 homes in Danbury, Fairfield, Trumbull, Wilton, Newtown, Norwalk, Avon and West Hartford. Nationwide, it has built 140 residential developments in 20 states from New Hampshire to Florida and from Virginia to California since it was founded in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., in 1967.</p>
        <p>Toll Brothers' homes attract customers from a broad demographic spectrum. Numerous choices of models and finishes, attention to detail and the custom look of the finished product ''are what sets us apart,'' said Greg Kamedulski, assistant vice president of the company's Connecticut operations, ''We won't allow any house to be the same model or have the same exterior finish or color as the one next door.''</p>
        <p>In April of last year, when Bruce and Florita Nickel began scanning builders' real estate ads, they saw one for Ridgebury Hills, a 27-acre Toll Brothers development under construction in Danbury, with master bedrooms available on the ground floor -- something they wanted.</p>
        <p>''We had a 3,800 square foot house on three acres in Pound Ridge, with a 250-foot driveway,'' Mr. Nickel said. ''Our children were grown and gone, we didn't know our neighbors, and my wife was not happy in what had become an isolated situation.'' Five months ago they moved into their 2,300 square foot house on a third of an acre at Ridgebury Hills.</p>
        <p>Seven models are available at the development, in Colonial, Federal, Williamsburg and Georgian styles, with three different exteriors for each model in various combinations of vinyl, brick and cement fiber siding. Standard features include two story-entrance foyers, nine-foot ceilings, crown moldings, chair rails in living and dining rooms, partial hardwood flooring and carpeting over plywood, fireplaces, two-car garages, breakfast areas, full basements, gas heating and cooking, and landscaping.</p>
        <p>The company's designs track changes in customer tastes. ''Kitchens,'' said Edward Weber, supervisor of a staff of some 45 Toll Brothers architects based in offices in Morrisville, Phoenix, Delray Beach, Philadelphia and San Francisco, ''have become almost breathtaking; so have bathrooms. Living rooms are smaller because the family room or study has become more important and much larger.''</p>
        <p>Lower prices for the company's homes in Connecticut than in neighboring Westchester have attracted some of its customers.  Robert Campisi and Phil Attina of New Rochelle, best friends since childhood, were looking for family homes. Both their wives are pregnant for the first time. ''We couldn't find anything we liked and could afford in Westchester,'' Mr. Campisi said. And Mr. Attina, who had admired Toll Brothers homes in White Plains for $900,000, was determined to buy one somehow. ''Connecticut was the closest place to get a new Toll Brothers house we could afford,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Campisis and the Attinas now live across the street from each other at Ridgebury Hills. ''It's a total change of life,'' said Mr. Attina, who left a position with his family's business in Rockland County and became manager of a Connecticut carpet warehouse. Mr. Campisi switched from managing a Westchester restaurant to working for a Connecticut company that makes restaurant software.</p>
        <p>Joanne Carroll, president of the Fairfield County Home Builders Association, noted that ''Danbury is the hottest town in the state right now.'' She added: '' Like most volume builders, Toll Brothers wants to sell five to six houses a month, so they go for the towns where people are heading for value and affordability. They stay out of Greenwich, Darien, New Canaan and Westport because of the cost of land.''</p>
        <p>In the fiscal year that ended on Oct. 31, 1999, the company sold 74 homes in Connecticut, and it is on a similar pace in the current fiscal year -- through July, it had sold 53 houses.</p>
        <p>Ridgebury Hills will eventually contain 90 homes, of which 45 have been sold and another 35 are under contract. Base prices range from $337,975 to $368,975, and some homeowners have paid as much as $150,000 more for upgrades, interior structural changes and add-ons like greenhouses or sun rooms. To date prices have risen incrementally by about $44,000 from the original base sale price of $294,975 in December 1998.</p>
        <p>WE made a down payment in April of '99,'' Mr. Campisi said, ''when there was only a model and 27 acres of dirt. By the time we moved into the house last February, the price had gone up by $25,000.'' His property taxes ''are $4,700 for a house that cost close to $380,000,'' he said. ''In Westchester taxes on this house would be $12,000, and the house would have cost another $50,000.''</p>
        <p>The development includes a group of ''affordable'' homes, sold under a state program to buyers who had to qualify under income-ceiling rules. Along the entry road to the complex are 18 homes that sold out at $190,000. An agreement with the city allowed the homes to be built 20 percent smaller and with less luxurious interiors than the 72 market-rate homes. Under Connecticut law, a buyer's total household income cannot exceed 80 percent of the area's median income -- which is $58,500 in the Danbury area -- to qualify for the lower price.</p>
        <p>When Toll Brothers bought the Ridgebury Hills property as an approved subdivision from Robert Kaufman, a developer who decided not to proceed, it was required to abide by the city's agreement with Mr. Kaufman to offer 20 percent of the homes below market rates. Toll Brothers has built housing for buyers with income below the median in Washington, D.C., and New Jersey but nowhere else in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''We concentrate on the luxury end of the business,'' said Robert I. Toll, 59, chairman and chief executive. ''Our average home goes for about $500,000. We are systematized and we try to marry production with customization so we can create additional value for our customers.'' At two locations, in Morrisville, Pa., and Emporia, Va., the company manufactures its own millwork, makes its own trusses, doors, windows and porticos, and warehouses its own lumber.</p>
        <p>''My father, Albert, was a home builder,'' said Mr. Toll. ''The talk around the dinner table when I was a teenager fascinated me, and I went with him to watch houses being built.'' After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, he worked briefly for a law firm, found it tedious and went into the home building business with his brother Bruce, now 57 and vice chairman of the company.</p>
        <p>Looking to expand beyond residential construction, two years ago the company formed the privately owned Toll Brothers Realty Trust in partnership with the Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System. ''The trust,'' said Kira McCarron, vice president of marketing for the company, ''is actively developing luxury rental apartments, offices and retail space in Fairfax County, Va.; Moorestown, N.J.; and Naples, Fla., where it is building a 731-home golf course community that will include a 38,000 square foot retail center.''</p>
        <p>In the Connecticut town of Fairfield, where Toll Brothers has built three complexes, its homes at Southport Chase, which sold for $620,000 when they were new five years ago, are reselling at $900,000, Mr. Kamedulski said. A fourth complex, called Southport Landing, is under construction in the $700,000 range. The town's first selectman, John G. Metsopolous, said: ''Your dollar buys a lot more here. Over the line in Westport, you get 30 percent less house.''</p>
        <p>The Villas at the Reservoir, a Toll Brothers community just beginning construction in West Hartford, will contain 71 homes on 68 acres overlooking the West Hartford Metropolitan District Reservoir. To purchase a home there, one member of the household must be an active adult 55 years of age or older, and children may not stay for more than 30 days. ''This is not an assisted-living community,'' said Eileen Kemp, the on-site sales agent. ''The average age is 62, and several buyers are physicians and technicians who work at UConn's Medical Center in Hartford.''</p>
        <p>All six models are one-story ranch-style, from 2,000 to 2,500 square feet, priced from $401,900 to $438,900. Common charges of $240 a month cover maintenance of the grounds, exteriors of the homes, decks, snow clearance and gutter cleaning.</p>
        <p>Toll Brothers' projects in Fairfield, Wilton, Newtown and Norwalk sold out last year. Slated for completion this year are 49 homes on half-acre lots at Huntington Estates in Shelton, priced at $440,000, and 19 homes at Trumbull Hunt on one-third-acre lots in Trumbull for $470,000. Under construction in Danbury are 18 homes on one-acre lots at Westville Estates, priced at $610,000, and in Avon a 106-unit active-adult condominium complex called Hunter's Run is priced at $420,000. Later this month construction of 21 homes on two-acre lots is to begin at Newtown Hunt in Newtown. Five models will be priced in the low $400,000's.</p>
        <p>Toll Brothers has had a relatively uneventful history in obtaining municipal approvals in Connecticut, but it lost a two-year dispute with Newtown over Newtown Hunt and had to reduce the number of lots from 30 to 21 because of the incursion of a road into a wetland.</p>
        <p>In Fairfield, its proposal for a clustered development of 100 homes on 50 acres zoned for offices brought some dissenters to public hearings, but the complex, called Greenfield Hunt, got its zone change and was completed last year. ''It was the standard type of interest in the proceedings,'' said Joseph Devonshuk, the town planner. ''Everyone would rather have an empty lot.''</p>
