        <p>Early on Aug. 24, Joe Richman said, he was asleep in his fifth-floor apartment at 219 East Seventh Street, between Avenues B and C,  when he was awakened by rumbling and vibration from construction next door. From his window, he watched a man operating a big tractor with a 70-foot-high pile driver.

        <p>Mr. Richman, 35, a freelance radio producer, and other residents say that was not the first damage to their six-story low-income co-op building from construction in the lot, the former site of the Esperanza Community Garden, which was bulldozed in April.

        <p>Early on Aug. 24, Joe Richman said, he was asleep in his fifth-floor apartment at 219 East Seventh Street, between Avenues B and C,  when he was awakened by rumbling and vibration from construction next door. From his window, he watched a man operating a big tractor with a 70-foot-high pile driver. He went back  to bed but was soon awakened again, this time when an 8-by-3-foot section of plaster fell from his ceiling, gashing his forehead, knocking over a lamp and scattering dust and debris.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richman, 35, a freelance radio producer, and other residents say that was not the first damage to their six-story low-income co-op building from construction in the lot, the former site of the Esperanza Community Garden, which was bulldozed in April. They say that since Raja Construction began pile-driving this summer to build a foundation, cracks have appeared in their basement and door frames have tilted.</p>
        <p>Raja was hired by BFC Inc., which is building a development that will include mainly market-rate housing and nearly 7,000 square feet of retail space on the site.</p>
        <p>After the Aug. 24 incident, the Buildings Department issued an order to halt the pile-driving. But on Sept. 1, it was revised to allow emergency bracing and shoring.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 5, at 7 a.m., pile-driving resumed, which Donald Capoccia, a principal of BFC, said was done to create a support. But the work was halted again when Marjorie Kaye Jr., a lawyer hired by the tenants of Mr. Richman's building, obtained an injunction to stop the pile driving.</p>
        <p>BFC lawyers have filed court papers asking to continue the work. A hearing is scheduled for tomorrow.</p>
        <p>''BFC is just as concerned with the structural stability of our neighboring buildings as are their residents,'' Mr. Capoccia said on Friday. ''I'm confident that all interested parties will be fully comfortable in seeing the work proceed.''</p>
        <p>Others disagree. Margarita Lopez, a Councilwoman from the East Village, cited a 1998 case in which she said work on a BFC project damaged a neighboring building on Avenue B, at East 12th Street. The city had cited BFC for failing to protect the  building, but an administrative law judge dismissed the violation.</p>
        <p>''Donald Capoccia has total disregard for the safety of the buildings in this area,'' Ms. Lopez said. ''And the government allows him to act irresponsibly. The Buildings Department should be doing more to monitor construction projects.''</p>
        <p>''We do monitor all residential constructions,'' said Paul Wein of the Buildings Department, ''and we respond to any and all complaints.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday evening, tenants of 219 East Seventh Street peered through a gap in a fence surrounding the construction site, asserting that excavation for the foundation had left their 100-year-old building's foundation unsupported and exposed.</p>
        <p>''We're not trying to get in the way of the construction,'' Sabrina Turin, 36, said. ''We just want to make sure that our building is not endangered.''</p>
