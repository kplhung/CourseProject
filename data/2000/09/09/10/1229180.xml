        <p>ORGANIZERS of this year's Eli Whitney Folk Festival, on Friday and Saturday in New Haven, have more than music on their minds. As they see it, they're part of a movement to promote justice, love, and community -- all those values from the 60's. But they couldn't do it, they acknowledge, without 21st-century technology.</p>
        <p>The festival had been a harbinger of fall for several years, as young and older gathered over Labor Day weekend in a natural amphitheater in Edgerton Park, the adults relaxing with their picnic baskets, the children rolling down the hill and later brandishing their light sticks in the dark. It had been a fund-raising event for two environmental groups, underwritten by a bank that folded in the mid-90's. Without a comparable sponsor, the festival died.</p>

        <p>ORGANIZERS of this year's Eli Whitney Folk Festival, on Friday and Saturday in New Haven, have more than music on their minds. As they see it, they're part of a movement to promote justice, love, and community -- all those values from the 60's. But they couldn't do it, they acknowledge, without 21st-century technology.</p>
        <p>The festival had been a harbinger of fall for several years, as young and older gathered over Labor Day weekend in a natural amphitheater in Edgerton Park, the adults relaxing with their picnic baskets, the children rolling down the hill and later brandishing their light sticks in the dark. It had been a fund-raising event for two environmental groups, underwritten by a bank that folded in the mid-90's. Without a comparable sponsor, the festival died.</p>
        <p>But last year it was resurrected by a Yale student who heard about the concerts and organized a community meeting, which led to formation of the New Haven Folk Alliance. The group began meeting with members of the Yale Student Folk Alliance. Together they got $10,000 from Citizens Bank to underwrite last year's concert, which featured Odetta, a 60's icon, and Dar Williams, a singer and songwriter whose fans are mostly under 30.</p>
        <p>James Van Pelt, director of the New Haven Folk Alliance, called the reincarnation of the festival miraculous. ''One of the big advantages we had that the earlier festival organizers didn't have was the Internet,'' he said. ''We wanted to get Dar Williams because she is the Jimmy Buffett of the young folk crowd. She has a very intense Web presence. When our concert was listed on her Web site, we sold hundreds of tickets within a week or two.''</p>
        <p>This year's festival starts with a song swap on Friday evening at the Eli Whitney Barn, adjacent to the main festival site at Edgerton Park on the New Haven/Hamden line. The featured performers are the songwriter Bob Franke, the singer Jennifer Kimball, the singer/violinist Kris Delmhorst and the guitarist Robert Messore.</p>
        <p>The festival continues Saturday in the park with free performances from 12:30 to 5 p.m., featuring a children's concert with Tom Paxton and showcasing some of Connecticut's outstanding folk musicians, including the Grammy award-winning dobro player Stacy Phillips, the jug band Washboard Slim and the Blue Lights, the Reilly Clan and the singer/songwriter Kevin Briody.</p>
        <p>The main event begins at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday with the Yale folk group Tangled Up in Blue, followed by Nerissa and Katryna Nields, a sister act with roots at Yale a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Then it's two headline acts: Tom Paxton and Sweet Honey in the Rock. Mr. Paxton is a singer/songwriter giant of the 60's folk scene, a few of whose classic tunes include ''Ramblin' Boy,'' ''Last Thing on My Mind'' and ''Bottle of Wine.''</p>
        <p>Sweet Honey in the Rock is a Grammy-award winning a cappella quintet of African-American women with a sound that draws on gospel, jazz and blues. Their Web site describes them as joining their powerful voices, along with hand percussion instruments, to blend lyrics, movement and narrative that variously relate history, point the finger at justice, encourage activism and sing the praises of love.</p>
        <p>Luke Bronin, a Yale undergraduate, directs the Yale Folk Alliance and is this year's festival director. In case of rain, the Saturday afternoon concerts will be canceled and the evening program, starting at 5:30 p.m., will take place in Woolsey Hall on the Yale campus. The group has a Web site (www.ctfolk.com) where tickets can be purchased in advance at a discount. Tickets can also be ordered by calling (877) 928-3655 (877-9CTFOLK).</p>
