        <p>Just a few years ago, Wall Street was being touted as the next big residential neighborhood. Vacant offices were converted into rental and condominium apartments. New York magazine called the area ''New York's Next Hot Place to Live.''</p>
        <p>''It was an unexplored area that was quiet, yet accessible,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, one of Manhattan's biggest real estate brokerage firms. ''You could get water views in some units.''</p>
        <p>Today the area is home to about 7,000 residents, many of whom moved in less than three years ago. But their paradise may end. The New York Stock Exchange has been considering a $727 million proposal to move its cramped 97-year-old trading floor, on the corner of Wall and Broad Streets, across Broad Street to a new 1.9-million-square-foot complex. The new structure would take up the block bounded by Wall, Broad and William Streets and Exchange Place, and would accommodate not only the exchange but also a 900-foot office tower.</p>
        <p>''It's a nightmare,'' said Chris Parrott, a new mother who moved last week to 25 Broad Street, a 345-unit luxury rental next to the proposed site. ''We already have a noise pollution problem. This is going to make it worse.''</p>
        <p>Brian Burns, a resident at 3 Hanover Square, a 204-unit condominium, said plans to restrict traffic along surrounding streets to accommodate the move would have disastrous results on his neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''All the traffic feeding this monstrous building will be funneled past my building,'' said Mr. Burns, speaking on Thursday at the first public meeting held on the project, a joint venture between the Stock Exchange, the city and the state. ''I came here for good schools and for a slice of peace and quiet.''</p>
        <p>The site for the new building is occupied by four structures, all of which would be demolished except for a landmark bank at 23 Wall Street, said T. J. Gottesdiener, a manager partner at Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the architects of the complex.</p>
        <p>Among the buildings condemned would be 45 Wall Street, an office tower converted into 435 residential units in 1997. Residents  said they had received little information about possible displacement, despite early assurances by the building owner, Rockrose Development, that it would help move tenants. Calls to Rockrose were not returned.</p>
        <p>Michael Carey, president of the Economic Development Corporation, which represents the city in the transaction, said at the meeting that a deal was ''very close.'' But no agreements have been made final in the nearly two years since the project was first announced.</p>
        <p>''The Coliseum at 57th Street has been going for 20 years now,'' said Vique Maggio, who lives at 3 Hanover Square. ''I figure it will be at least 10 years before anything happens.''</p>
