        <p>OUR flotilla of three large rafts and an assortment of eight kayaks had successfully negotiated the four-foot drop of Tappan Falls, a difficult rapid on the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in Idaho, when fire, rather than water, grabbed our attention. It was late on the third day of our four-day raft trip in mid-August, a vacation my husband, Michael, and I and our teenage daughters, Hilary and Ariel, had squeezed into a few of the days remaining before Hilary left home to start her freshman year of college in Indiana.</p>
        <p>We did not see flames, but a great lather of gray-bellied smoke tinged with red suddenly loomed over the canyon wall on the southeast side of the river. Whether the fire was 2 miles away or 20 was hard to tell. Fires had been burning all over the drought-stricken West.</p>
        <p>I had read in an Idaho newspaper that 10 fires had been counted the second week of August, charring more than 350,000 acres of national forest. So far they had not posed a threat to the Middle Fork, so we decided to go ahead. The Middle Fork is a 100-mile wild river that splits the Frank Church River-of-No-Return Wilderness Area. At 3,600 square miles it is the largest roadless area in the lower 48 states, sprawling over a region that exceeds the size of Delaware. The only way to reach its forbidding interior is by small plane; the planes can land along the river in the rare places where the terrain is level.</p>
        <p>I asked our raft guide, Taz, what we would do if the fire burning over that haunch of rock approached the river. We had passed a dramatic example 20 miles upstream, where the 1979 Mortar Creek wildfire had raged down the slope, jumped the river, and raced up the other side, leaving 65,000 acres in cinders on both sides of the water. Like scattered toothpicks, thousands of naked pines still lay where they had fallen.</p>
        <p>Taz talked gamely about how we'd hunker down between river and a rock wall, somehow sandwiching all 26 of us in the pockets between rafts flipped over on top of each other. ''Until the fire passes over us,'' she said, for comfort. Then she said, enthusiastically, ''I love natural disasters.''</p>
        <p>The truth is that so do most of us, to a certain extent. The paradox of wilderness is that we who seek it want to be awed by nature's rampages -- but only as long as nobody gets hurt.</p>
        <p>Back at Tappan Falls, Taz had told the inexperienced kayakers to ''focus on the chutes, not the rocks,'' as they plunged over the four-foot drop into the churning foam. ''It's magnetism,'' she said. ''You'll be pulled to where you are looking.'' So rather than remain transfixed by the mottled smoke, I shifted my gaze to the whitewater ahead. The river was our only way out.</p>
        <p>We made camp that night on a level timbered rise a few miles downstream and across the river from this latest fire. The dense, gray air smelled like a giant cookout. Four air tankers flew in flame retardant to drop on the fire. Soon the air cleared.</p>
        <p>The scent of burning intensified again overnight. People roamed around the camp nervously. Those who couldn't sleep marveled at the way the debris-filled smoke had colored the full moon a deep orange, as if it, too, were ablaze. There was no breeze, and it was so warm I threw aside my sleeping bag. When I finally slept I dreamed that Marines and a herd of elephants had been airlifted into our campsite. The elephants uprooted all the trees and vegetation and the Marines shoveled a black scum over everything. ''You'll be safe now,'' a soldier told me. It wasn't a pretty sight even in the dream, but I think I slept better.</p>
        <p>The next morning, the day our family and two other people in the group were scheduled to fly out, the smoke was thicker. Ariel complained that her eyes stung. Confronting the perils of both water and fire had made friends out of strangers in three days, and we were all sad to say goodbye (the rest of the group would continue on the river for two more days). We left with Taz and paddled our raft to an airstrip at the Flying B Ranch, five miles downstream. Two planes would be there to drop off two families that would take our places on the river, and fly us out to Stanley, a town of 69 people half an hour away.</p>
        <p>We reached the airstrip at 10:30 as planned. No planes were waiting for us. Taz walked to the Flying B Ranch to radio in and find out what had happened to the planes, and to get a fire report. Meanwhile, the other guides and the rest of our group had arrived to pick up the newcomers. Taz returned with the news: both planes had set out with their passengers, but it seemed both had turned back because of poor visibility. Taz had also learned that new wildfires had erupted in the vicinity, and that a couple staying at the Flying B had galloped ahead of the fire that engulfed their own property 18 miles away. They escaped with their horses, dogs and a few belongings.</p>
        <p>At the airstrip, the windsock drooped. The smoke was so dense that we couldn't make out the nearest ridges and I had trouble breathing. If the smoke didn't dissipate our family would have no choice but to continue on the river to the take-out near the junction of the Middle Fork and the Salmon. There we would not have to depend on the airplanes. A road led back to civilization. Michael was happy with the prospect of staying on the river for two more days, but Hilary began to cry.</p>
        <p>AFTER the bleak report we were surprised to hear the sound of an engine, and soon a small airplane emerged from the blanket of smoke. It circled the airstrip a few times, and finally the pilot could see the ground well enough to land. Out of the cabin climbed one blanched passenger, and one shaken pilot.</p>
        <p>''I don't know about you, but that was the most afraid I've ever been,'' the pilot  said to his passenger, Dave. The second plane had tried to bring in Dave's wife and three children, but it had been forced  to turn back. The pilot who landed at the Flying B had tried to turn back, too, but  by then couldn't see well enough. He said  the visibility was no more than a quarter of a mile, and he was kicking himself for taking the risk of coming in. He wasn't  going anywhere until the smoke lifted.</p>
        <p>Hilary fell apart. ''If I don't get home tomorrow I won't see my friends for three months!'' she cried. Then 13-year old Ariel weighed in: ''If I miss any more gymnastics, my coaches won't let me move up!'' They both stalked off.</p>
        <p>Ah, youthful optimism. It is the chute, not the rocks. I, however, was unable to restrain myself from pointing out the particular rocks in our situation. ''Listen,'' I said angrily. ''This is much more serious than not seeing friends for three months and missing gymnastics. Don't you understand that none of us know how or when we are getting out? There are fires burning all around us, and people's ranches are going up in smoke!''</p>
        <p>Then a woman from the group, Stephanie, took Hilary aside and spoke more philosophically than I had. ''This is one of those character-building situations you face in life,'' she told Hilary. ''You can handle it any way you want.'' Hilary and I regained our composure. She opened the book she had brought, and sprawled in the slender shadow of the parked plane's wing.</p>
        <p>That a shadow was being cast at all indicated that for the first time that day, the sun was shining, albeit wanly, through the haze. The windsock, which had hung limply for more than three hours, fluttered. I went over to where Hilary sat and pointed upward. ''Let's focus on that little bit of blue, not the smoke,'' I said.</p>
        <p>Thirty minutes later the grounded plane flew off in a wide blue chute of sky, and a short while after that, the second plane landed. It was magnetism.</p>
        <p>Postscript: Those who continued on the river were showered by ash at their last campsite; the six cool-headed guides with Far and Away Adventures, the outfit running our trip, got everybody out safely on Aug. 16, to discover that the River of No Return Wilderness Area had been closed by the Forest Service. On Aug. 18 the Flying B Ranch was hit by a firestorm with a combination of fire and winds of almost 100 miles an hour that destroyed much of the ranch. Twelve to fourteen people took refuge in a green hayfield and on a gravel bar in the river. Nobody was hurt.</p>
