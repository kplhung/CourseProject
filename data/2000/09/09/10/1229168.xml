        <p>London's Science Museum has recently opened a 107,640-square-foot addition that explores such topics as genetics, digital technology and artificial intelligence. Designed by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard, the four floors of the new Wellcome Wing contain six exhibition areas and a 450-seat Imax theater.</p>
        <p>A first-floor exhibition called Antenna presents the latest developments in science. It covers drugs in sports, among other subjects, and looks at how engineers study sea life such as sharks and seahorses with robotic submarines. Pattern Pod, an area for children 8 and younger, allows participants to explore patterns that occur in nature, like those in a butterfly's wings, through hands-on games and interactive wall and floor panels.</p>

        <p>London's Science Museum has recently opened a 107,640-square-foot addition that explores such topics as genetics, digital technology and artificial intelligence. Designed by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard, the four floors of the new Wellcome Wing contain six exhibition areas and a 450-seat Imax theater.</p>
        <p>A first-floor exhibition called Antenna presents the latest developments in science. It covers drugs in sports, among other subjects, and looks at how engineers study sea life such as sharks and seahorses with robotic submarines. Pattern Pod, an area for children 8 and younger, allows participants to explore patterns that occur in nature, like those in a butterfly's wings, through hands-on games and interactive wall and floor panels.</p>
        <p>Who Am I, on the second floor, presents the latest developments in biomedical research. Visitors will see equipment used for the Human Genome Project and will be able to find out how DNA was used in identifying living relatives of the Bleadon Man, a 2,000-year-old Iron Age man.</p>
        <p>A highlight of the new wing is the computer that Tim Berners-Lee used to design the World Wide Web at the CERN physics laboratory near Geneva, writing the first software for it in 1990 and 1991; it can be seen at  Digitopolis on the third floor. In Future, on the fourth floor, allows visitors to use interactive games to explore how science and technology can affect the future.</p>
        <p>The Science Museum, Exhibition Road, South Kensington, London SW7 2DD; (44-207) 942 4455, www.sciencemuseum.org.uk. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission $10.40, free for children under 16.</p>
