        <p>Scott Brosius was one of the first Yankees to come out for pregame stretching this morning. Sunshine covered the field, and Brosius seemed in a particularly good mood.

        <p>Scott Brosius was one of the first Yankees to come out for pregame stretching this morning. Sunshine covered the field, and Brosius seemed in a particularly good mood. His good friend Andy Pettitte was getting ready to pitch against the Boston superstar Pedro Martinez, and Brosius had an edgy smile.</p>
        <p>''So the Red Sox think that they're going to win because Pedro is pitching,'' Brosius said, without prompting, in a mostly empty dugout. ''O.K. We'll see.''</p>
        <p>Bearing that determined confidence, Brosius came to bat in the seventh inning with the Red Sox leading, 1-0. He bashed a three-run homer and wrecked Martinez's shutout, propelling Pettitte and the Yankees to a 5-3 victory.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox added a couple of after-the-fact runs in the bottom of the ninth, which hardly mitigated the disaster that has hit them in the first two days of this series. Bryce Florie, one of their most serviceable pitchers, suffered a horrible injury and is out for the year, and their old friend Roger Clemens shut them out for eight innings on Friday night before Pettitte allowed one run in eight innings and outdueled their ace today. Pettitte (18-7) is the the first pitcher since the Mets' Bobby J. Jones, in 1997, to beat Martinez (16-5) twice in the same season.</p>
        <p>Winning the division is all but out of the question for the Red Sox, now that they are eight games behind the Yankees -- whose clinching number is down to 16 -- and Boston has slipped in the wild-card race, to three games behind Cleveland, the leader.</p>
        <p>Pettitte has 87 victories since the start of the 1996 season, and Martinez is the only pitcher who has more, 88. But Brosius' conviction was probably based on the Yankees' ability to compete against Martinez as much as on Pettitte's success.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have won the last three games started by the Boston ace. The pattern in the games has generally been the same: they force Martinez to work hard early in the game, driving up his pitch count and tiring him, and if they can't muster runs against him, then they get him out of the game in the middle innings and attack the Red Sox bullpen.</p>
        <p>Pettitte gave the Yankees a chance. He follows Clemens in the rotation and Orlando Hernandez follows Pettitte, and if the playoffs were to begin this week in Yankee Stadium, those three would probably start in that order. They are all pitching exceptionally, they are all very sound right now, and it may not be a coincidence that all three have spent some weeks on the disabled list this season, the injuries limiting their innings.</p>
        <p>They have one other thing in common: Pettitte, Clemens and Hernandez have all come to rely more on the fastball in the second half of the season. Clemens mostly eschewed his slider on Friday, throwing one or two, and used his split-fingered fastball to complement his fastball. When Hernandez allowed one run in eight innings to Kansas City the other day, he threw far more fastballs than at any point in his tenure with the Yankees, said Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach.</p>
        <p>Catcher Jorge Posada believes there is no better pitch than a well-located fastball, and he kept calling for it today. Seventeen of the 19 pitches Pettitte threw in the first inning were fastballs, inside and outside, up and down, and he generally stifled the Red Sox offense, matching zeros with Martinez, feeling that his concentration was heightened by the site and the circumstances. Boston scored a run in the third, when Carl Everett lofted a two-out double off the left-field wall, scoring Jose Offerman.</p>
        <p>Martinez was as overpowering and confusing as ever in the first six innings, striking out six of the first nine hitters he faced, throwing fastballs at speeds as high as 98 miles an hour and holding the Yankees hitless until the fourth inning. But the Yankees had at least pushed him; their first seven batters all took a strike the first time through the lineup, forcing him to throw 44 pitches in the first two innings.</p>
        <p>His pitch count was near 100 when the seventh inning started. Tino Martinez singled to lead off the inning for the Yankees, but the Boston right-hander retired the next two hitters. Posada, who had already struck out twice, quickly reached a two-strike count before patiently drawing a walk, his 99th of the season. Brosius was next.</p>
        <p>Almost across the board, the Yankees' individual statistics against Martinez are overwhelmingly bad; Posada had been 1 for 15 with eight strikeouts, for example. But Brosius' were respectable when the game began, 7 for 24 (.292), and in his first at-bat today, he lined out hard. In his second at-bat, however, Brosius had swung awkwardly at a couple of changeups and fouled out.</p>
        <p>Now batting in the seventh, two on and two out, Brosius fell behind, no balls and two strikes. Martinez threw two balls, zipped a fastball low and away -- ball three. Martinez got the ball back and paused, remembering how Brosius had looked bad trying to hit the changeup earlier in the game.</p>
        <p>Brosius was thinking along with him. ''He got me with two changeups earlier,'' Brosius said. ''It was in the back of my mind.''</p>
        <p>On the Yankees' bench, Ryan Thompson turned to Glenallen Hill. ''Glen, watch this,'' Thompson said. If Martinez ''throws an off-speed pitch right now, he'll take him deep.''</p>
        <p>Martinez said: ''It was 3-2, do or die. I didn't want to load the bases.''</p>
        <p>He threw a changeup, waist high, over the middle of the plate, and Brosius killed it, beginning his home run trot as the ball rippled the net above the Green Monster.</p>
        <p>Brosius slapped the hand of the first-base coach, Lee Mazzilli, as he passed the bag, and two innings later, Jose Canseco did the same, crushing a two-run homer. The Yankees have outhomered the Red Sox, 13-0, in Fenway Park this year.</p>
        <p>Boston's scouting report on the Yankees, prepared for this series, begins with this thought: ''The Yankees have been playing the best baseball of the season lately.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Yankees' switch-hitting center fielder, BERNIE WILLIAMS, hampered by a strained rib cage, is expected to play Sunday, when the left-hander PETE SCHOUREK starts for Boston. Williams has been taking batting practice right-handed and does not feel that he aggravates his injury from the right side.</p>
