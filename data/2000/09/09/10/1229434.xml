        <p>After what he called ''one of the worst fire seasons in memory,'' President Clinton said yesterday that he would seek to more than double federal spending on wildfire programs in the year ahead. He asked Congress for nearly $1.6 billion more to aid affected communities and to try to prevent future blazes.</p>
        <p>The announcement was in part an attempt to bounce back politically after weeks in which Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have come under sharp criticism from Republicans, including Gov. George W. Bush, for what their critics say is a pro-environment bias that has increased the fire risk.</p>
        <p>Even as cooler weather and rain have begun to dampen this year's flames, concern about fires and their aftermath remains intense across the West, in a season that has already scorched more than six million acres. Mr. Clinton's call for more spending may have been aimed in particular at voters in California, Washington and Oregon, which are seen as important to Mr. Gore's presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>''Saving lives and property is, and will remain, Priority 1,'' Mr. Clinton said in his radio address yesterday. He said next year's wildfire budget should jump to $2.8 billion, up from $1.2 billion this year.</p>
        <p>About $700 million of the new money would go to replenish accounts depleted by the high cost of firefighting in a year likely to be the most devastating in half a century. Other big increases would extend relief to hard-hit communities and pay for efforts to restore the worst of the fire-torn areas, and -- in what administration officials have portrayed as a hallmark of the plan -- greatly increase programs aimed at reducing fire risks by thinning overgrown forests of their smallest, most fire-prone trees, while leaving the largest, most fire-resistant trees behind.</p>
        <p>''Our administration has taken a new approach to protect communities and reduce wildfire risks by getting rid of the forest underbrush that has accumulated over the last century,'' Mr. Clinton said. He added, ''We want to work with communities to expand these efforts, in an environmentally sensitive way, particularly in those areas at greatest risk of wildfire.''</p>
        <p>The plan, described in a report submitted to the president by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, did not say how widespread the expansion would be. Current thinning efforts, which rely on prescribed fire and mechanical thinning, cover just 2.4 million acres a year, a fraction of the 40 million acres of public land that remain at catastrophic risk of fire.</p>
        <p>An estimate by the General Accounting Office has put the total cost of a thinning effort at $12 billion over 15 years.</p>
        <p>In his remarks, Mr. Clinton conceded that this year's fires did in part grow out of past policies, but he pointed the finger at the nearly 100 years in which federal managers emphasized forest suppression over forest health. The Clinton administration began to move away from that approach five years ago, through policies that have emphasized preventive fires and mechanical cutting.</p>
        <p>The president's critics have argued that the best way to make forests healthier would be by permitting more timber sales on public lands. But the White House made clear that it was rejecting that approach, saying that the report from Mr. Babbitt and Mr. Glickman favored alternatives that ''can successfully reduce fire risk without relying on increased commercial logging.''</p>
        <p>A report late last month by the bipartisan Congressional Research Service found no link between logging and fire risk, but critics have taken issue with that conclusion, saying that the damage from this year's fires could have been reduced if more timber harvesting had been permitted.</p>
        <p>Last year, loggers harvested about three billion board feet of timber from public lands, a sharp decline from a high of almost 13 billion board feet in the late 1980's. A main reason for the decline was increased attention by the Clinton administration and the federal courts to environmental concerns, such as the risk to the habitat of the spotted owl.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Governor Bush has been among those saying that the Clinton administration's policies were at least in part to blame for the severity of this year's fires. Mr. Bush has vowed ''to put our national forests back to work.''</p>
        <p>The debate over logging and fires is likely to become even more prominent in the days ahead as Congress takes up the administration's request. Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho, who is chairman of the Senate Forests and Public Lands Management subcommittee, has already called for hearings to examine the prospect of increased timber cutting on public lands.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the timber industry, which has close ties to Western Republicans, yesterday described the administration's approach as a good first step toward recognizing the importance of reducing fire risks. But the spokesman, Michael Klein of the American Forest and Paper Association, said it would be a mistake to shut his industry out.</p>
        <p>''Commercial logging is a dirty word for them, but it works pretty well on our private lands, which provide jobs, healthy forests and just as many fish and wildlife habitats as do public lands,'' Mr. Klein said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>The plan for thinning forests has been shaped in large part by a program under way in Flagstaff, Ariz., which has won support from some business and environmental groups but is opposed by other environmentalists on the grounds that it could pose dangers to animal habitat.</p>
        <p>A number of forestry experts, however, offered praise yesterday for the administration's stepped-up approach. ''They're talking about a strong program for mechanical thinning and prescribed burning, and that's exactly what these forests need,'' said Michael Goergen, director of forest policy for the Society of American Foresters.</p>
