      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Aug. 6 about efforts to achieve Arab unity misstated the date and purpose of the formation of the Arab League. A letter dated Sept. 1 from its Washington representative points out that the treaty establishing the league was signed on March 22, 1945; the date was not 1949 and the purpose was not to organize opposition to the state of Israel, which had not yet been founded. The treaty spoke only of strengthening relations among members in financial, communications, cultural, health, social, nationality and social areas.</p>
