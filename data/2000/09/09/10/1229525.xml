        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Nation's Schools Struggling to Find Enough Principals'' (front page, Sept. 3):</p>
        <p>When I was first a principal in 1967, three students stayed at lunch and the rest went home. By the time I retired 10 years ago, all the students stayed, most for a hot lunch. This illustrates the changes in responsibility placed on principals.</p>
        <p>These new tasks, which also include after-school programs, administering medication and social work, come on top of the traditional expectations that principals provide a safe climate for learning, maintain the building, supervise professionals and  answer the questions and concerns of parents, students and superiors.</p>
        <p>We have always tried to have public schools on the cheap by paying minimal salaries, so it is no surprise that we now see a shortage of principals. But giving veteran administrators pay that is equal to, or less than, that of first-year graduates of business schools will no longer work. A national commitment is needed so that our schools can have stable and effective leadership.</p>
