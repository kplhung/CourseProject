        <p>Now that prints are in style,  Pucci power is back in full force. But connoisseurs of its colorful swirling designs, like Veronica Hinman, insist there's an art to wearing the label. Ms. Hinman, the beauty editor of Glamour, says she prefers vintage Pucci to current styles because the retro patterns are more distinctive. She also buys unusual silhouettes, rather than basic tanks and leggings, or ''Pucci for dummies,'' as she called them. And Ms. Hinman never pairs Pucci with other logos, like a Chanel bag or an Hermes belt. ''You can't mix it up with the rest of Fifth and Madison,'' she explained. ''Otherwise you'll look like a consignment shop on heels.''</p>
        <p>As for her heels, Ms. Hinman is wearing boots by Jimmy Choo ($700) in tan, which match her skin tone, giving her legs a nearly bare, sexy look (Jimmy Choo, 645 Fifth Avenue).</p>

        <p>Her dress, in white, purple and brown jersey, tapers at the waist and skims the hips. It was Pucci's rendition of a shirtdress (from Mint, a vintage store in Sag Harbor, $700). ''Pucci is part of the fashion pendulum,'' she said. ''My mother wore all these get-ups for dinner parties in the 70's. The look, the color, the fabric, the fit, the length are all right on now.''</p>
