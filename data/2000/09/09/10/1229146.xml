        <p>HEATHER HEADLEY  Actress and singer</p>
        <p>WHEN you're already performing in a show, and a new theater season is just beginning, it's like being in high school and you are a junior or a senior and you want to see what the freshmen -- the new shows coming in -- are doing.</p>
        <p>The thing that happened with me in ''Ragtime'' was that I fell in love with Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty, who wrote the score. That is, of course, besides being in love with Elton John. If Lynn and Stephen were to write ''Baa Baa Black Sheep,'' I would sing it. So I'm looking forward to ''Seussical.'' With all due respect to everyone, I think they write the most beautiful music. I'm also curious to see how they bring the story to the stage. It's like ''The Lion King.'' You hear it's coming and you say, ''What?''</p>

        <p>HEATHER HEADLEY  Actress and singer</p>
        <p>WHEN you're already performing in a show, and a new theater season is just beginning, it's like being in high school and you are a junior or a senior and you want to see what the freshmen -- the new shows coming in -- are doing.</p>
        <p>The thing that happened with me in ''Ragtime'' was that I fell in love with Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty, who wrote the score. That is, of course, besides being in love with Elton John. If Lynn and Stephen were to write ''Baa Baa Black Sheep,'' I would sing it. So I'm looking forward to ''Seussical.'' With all due respect to everyone, I think they write the most beautiful music. I'm also curious to see how they bring the story to the stage. It's like ''The Lion King.'' You hear it's coming and you say, ''What?''</p>
        <p>Terrence McNally, who wrote the book for ''Ragtime,'' was the other guy I fell in love with in that show. He's written the book for ''The Full Monty,'' which I'm hoping to see. I've heard about the nakedness, and that would be fun.</p>
        <p>I'd also like to see ''The Producers'' when it lands. I love Nathan Lane with all my heart, and I'd like to see him in that. And I want to go to ''King Hedley II'' when it gets to New York. I want to go not only because August Wilson wrote it but because I've heard about the play.</p>
        <p>I'd love to do a play for a different feel. But if I wasn't singing on the side I would miss it. I think songs sometimes say things in ways that words can't.</p>
        <p>ROBERT WHITEHEAD  Broadway producer</p>
        <p>THE first thing I'm interested in seeing is the musicalization of ''The Visit.'' I'm naturally curious about it because I was one of the producers of the Broadway play, which the Lunts starred in. And also, when they take any play and turn it into a musical, I feel a sense of despair. But in this case I don't because the author of the musical book, Terrence McNally, sent me a copy. And I thought it was lovely.</p>
        <p>I'm also curious about ''Proof,'' which I saw at the Manhattan Theater Club. It had an idea that I liked enormously, a quality and a point of view about life. I suspect they will do even better with it on Broadway.</p>
        <p>And, of course, ''The Best Man.'' I was close to that and I had a kind of a relationship with the playwright. The play was an outgrowth of the feeling in the country for Adlai Stevenson, at a time when plays talked about issues that have something to do with our lives and society. There is so little onstage in that department today. We should have 30 or 40 plays coming in, out of which 20 will fail. The plays that traditionally dominated the theater scene were plays of protest -- which were always the most exciting and interesting to talk about.</p>
        <p>I think the great American musical got damaged because the volume of American plays that musicals fed off diminished so much that even the plays themselves could not help being affected by it. The better plays -- whether they are comedy, drama or tragedy -- are always about what people are trying to discuss in the society.</p>
        <p>I'm optimistic, though. I think there are going to be reasons for people to write straight plays. But there has to be a volume of work for it to really affect the society.</p>
        <p>NIGEL REDDEN  Director, Lincoln Center Festival</p>
        <p>THERE are several things I'm looking forward to. The Almeida Theater Company productions of ''Coriolanus'' and ''Richard II'' from London that Jonathan Kent is directing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music should be wonderful.</p>
        <p>Then there are two possibilities for this season, though the deals haven't been made yet. They are two pieces that Simon McBurney is directing. ''Mnemonic'' -- he did it in Salzburg and redid it in London -- is supposed to arrive in the early part of next year. It's going to be a fascinating piece -- about memory and place. The other, ''Light,'' is based on an extraordinary contemporary Swedish novel by Torgny Lindgren. You could call it Swedish magic realism. I suppose it's those long winters. It's about a village at the very end of the world. Somehow a plague from civilization reaches it, and the story has to do with what that does to life in that village at the end of the world.</p>
        <p>I'm also eager to see Marlowe's ''Dido,'' which David Herskovits is doing at the Target Margin Theater. I've been quite interested in what he does. His ''Mamba's Daughters'' was wonderful. He believed in it on one hand -- it was not simply a period piece -- but he did not allow it to get maudlin.</p>
        <p>DAVID HENRY HWANG  Playwright</p>
        <p>I CAN'T wait to see ''King Hedley II.'' August Wilson's work is always groundbreaking. This one is more epic and mythical, more in the style of ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' which is one of my favorites of his plays. I've heard a lot of things about it. It has a large style to it and, besides, I love his work.</p>
        <p>I'm also looking forward to Jessica Hagedorn's ''Dogeaters'' at the Public Theater. The novel on which it is based is a classic among Asian-American novels. The book has a sort of magical epic theatricalism, which I think should translate.</p>
        <p>Then there is the new Craig Lucas play, ''Stranger,'' at the Vineyard Theater. I heard him read the first scene. Each of his works, especially ''The Dying Gaul,'' represents another step forward in his writing. I'm excited to see where he goes from there.</p>
        <p>The revival of ''Follies'' by the Roundabout will be an epic event. It's a score and a book beloved by theater people.</p>
        <p>ELLIE COVAN  Executive director of the performance space Dixon Place</p>
        <p>I WOULDN'T miss the Foundry Theater's production of ''And God Created Great Whales'' with Rinde Eckert. I didn't get to it the first time around, so I will this time. I saw their last big production, ''Gertrude and Alice'' with Linda Chapman and Lola Pashalinski, who also wrote it. I'm very happy the Foundry is doing so well.</p>
        <p>At New York Theater Workshop the piece I really want to see the most is ''Resident Alien,'' about Quentin Crisp, performed by Bette Bourne. Mike Bradwell directed from the Bush Theater in London, where it has been a great success.</p>
        <p>There are a couple of things I wouldn't miss at P.S. 122: Bill Shannon, a performer from the hip-hop community, who is known as Crutchmaster. He gets around on crutches and dances. He is doings: ''Old Rain,'' a multimedia work, and ''Regarding the Fall,'' a new dance piece.</p>
        <p>And Stanya Kahn, who is doing a new piece, ''The Ballad of Crappy and Seapole.'' She is an amazing writer and performer. You can't categorize her, which makes her interesting to me. She plays various outrageous characters, but she blends them so smoothly you don't really see the change. It's as if she were channeling. I just know it's going to be an evening of joy and I'm not going to be disappointed.</p>
        <p>LILY TOMLIN  Performer</p>
        <p>BECAUSE of Charles Busch, I'm eager to see ''The Tale of the Allergist's Wife.'' I'm interested that a work of his is on Broadway. It must be saying something. Also, Ann Roth, who did the costumes, is a good friend. Whenever there is a play on Broadway I'm excited.</p>
        <p>And I'm excited to be coming back myself, to being part of the Broadway community. It's like being in a small town. People say, ''Hi, Lily,'' on the street.</p>
        <p>The thought of Mel Brooks on Broadway with his musical ''The Producers'' is funny and intriguing.</p>
        <p>And then there's the new Sam Shepard play, ''The Late Henry Moss,'' opening in San Francisco with a bunch of actors: Nick Nolte, Cheech Marin, Woody Harrelson, James Gammon and Sean Penn. Can you imagine the testosterone levels at the rehearsals?</p>
        <p>As Judith Beasley [a Tomlin character] says, ''The reason I love theater is that theater can be so enriching, uplifting, breathtaking, ennobling, insightful, deep, hilarious, glorious, affirming, magnificent, awe-inspiring, thrilling -- everything that real life isn't.''</p>
