        <p>Late last month, President Vladimir V. Putin faced a room full of angry Russians, the relatives of the 118 men who perished on the nuclear submarine Kursk. He told them bluntly that Russia ''had to have a smaller army,'' one that was better equipped and ''technically perfect'' to protect soldiers and sailors from disaster and defend national interests.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Defense Minister Marshal Igor D. Sergeyev appeared to promise just such a force. While visiting a tank test range outside Moscow, he was asked by reporters to comment on a report that the armed forces would be reduced by 350,000 between 2001 and 2003, a cut of about one-third, from 1.2 million members to about 850,000.</p>
        <p>''Decisions to that effect have been made,'' he said, ''and proposals on how to proceed are being drafted for the president.''</p>
        <p>Marshal Sergeyev's almost offhand confirmation that Mr. Putin has approved deep cuts in the military followed weeks of speculation in the Russian news media and a marathon session between Mr. Putin and his national security advisers Aug. 11 on the future of the military.</p>
        <p>That meeting occurred a day before the Kursk sank during military maneuvers in the Barents Sea.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Putin later met with the families of the Kursk crew, he hinted that profound decisions on the reconstruction of Russia's armed forces had been made. He told them that ''one has to live according to one's income'' and that Russia had ''wasted money'' trying to support the military structure that the Soviet Union had maintained during the cold war. What the country needed, he made plain, was a smaller force.</p>
        <p>''These decisions have been passed,'' Mr. Putin said.</p>
        <p>The details of the secret session between Mr. Putin and his advisers still have to emerge fully. But reports in the Russian press this week said that Mr. Putin had decided to cut 400,000 members of Russia's armed forces, including its many domestic security and intelligence forces. Marshal Sergeyev's comments were in response to these reports.</p>
        <p>Russian military officials say the force-reduction plan will reach Mr. Putin's desk in the coming days. It seems clear that the Russian leader is undertaking one of the most difficult military reorganizations since the heyday of the Soviet Union, when Moscow supported 4.3 million troops in uniform, masses of tank divisions facing Europe, a deep-water navy and a strategic nuclear arsenal rivaling that of the United States.</p>
        <p>Marshal Sergeyev did not give a detailed breakdown of the cuts envisaged, but military officials have been quoted as saying that ground forces are to be cut by 180,000, the navy by more than 50,000, the air force by about 40,000, Interior Ministry troops by 20,000, the Federal Security Service and Government Communications Service by 25,000 and other security forces by 15,000 or more.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin returned from New York this morning and closeted himself with his senior advisers as members of Parliament and the military establishment weighed in on the debate over military power.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the Parliament's budget committee, Aleksandr Zhukov, said the draft 2001 budget envisages a very large growth in expenditure for the military, suggesting that Mr. Putin may be pursuing a strategy of raising pay levels in the military as he slashes its numbers.</p>
        <p>After years of contraction that have thrown millions of Russian officers and soldiers into a depressed economy on meager pensions, Mr. Putin now faces the politically wrenching task of cutting hundreds of thousands more active-duty slots. Many of these people may be ill-prepared to find work in a market economy that, while improving, has contracted by nearly half over the past decade.</p>
        <p>Russia inherited a two-million-member military establishment after the Soviet Union broke up in 1991,  and President Boris N. Yeltsin struggled unsuccessfully to cut it to 1.5 million during his first term in office. After Mr. Yeltsin's re-election in 1996, he appointed Marshal Sergeyev as defense minister and over the next four years was able to reduce the level from 1.7 million to 1.2 million by attrition and early retirements.</p>
        <p>The newspaper Kommersant reported today that as many as 200,000 military personnel are currently near retirement and nearly 100,000 empty slots in the military are unfilled. But the newspaper added that even if the problem can be partly solved through a decrease in the number of conscripts, the upcoming reduction will be the widest.</p>
        <p>The former deputy commander of Russian ground forces, Eduard A. Vorobyov, now a member of Parliament, said the sinking of the Kursk has given Mr. Putin a political impetus to push forward quickly with painful cuts.</p>
        <p>''I think it is a certain impulse for everybody,'' he said, ''including the president as the supreme commander. No matter whether we wanted to or not, we had to come to the decision made today.''</p>
        <p>The retired general became famous for resigning his commission rather than command the Russian assault on the rebellious republic of Chechnya in December 1994. His endorsement of Mr. Putin's plan indicated that there is significant political support among at least some military leaders for a rational restructuring of the armed forces, even if that means further cuts.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Putin met with his security advisers last month, he told his commanders that the structure of the armed forces is hardly optimal.</p>
        <p>''How can it be considered optimal if training is not conducted in many units, pilots almost do not fly and sailors almost do not put to sea?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin said he was after a ''balanced decision,'' one that his advisers said would plan for rebuilding the military over 15 years with a greater emphasis on conventional forces and a reduction in the autonomy and prestige of the Strategic Rocket Forces, which have been under separate command since the 1970's.</p>
        <p>The Russian leader did not specifically refer to the military's performance in the past year in Chechnya. Military commanders there have complained that they have been fighting with outdated tanks, helicopters and aircraft while Russia's military industries sell their best products and technology abroad.</p>
        <p>And due to the unpopularity of military service, the army has failed to meet its monthly conscript quotas in the face of widespread draft avoidance.</p>
