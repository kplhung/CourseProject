        <p>COROMANDEL, a new restaurant in Darien, is the latest Indian arrival this year, and it is already proving itself by bringing a new level of creativity to this venerable cuisine.</p>
        <p>What makes this newcomer so special is that many of the dishes on the menu are South Indian, both from the Coromandel region and also from Kerala, on the southwest coast. This is fine by us, as we are keen on this regional Indian cuisine of fiery, yet subtle, dishes and vegetarian specialties, which has long been under-represented in the United States.</p>
        <p>In a large, intriguing menu we concentrated mostly on the more unusual South Indian dishes and found numerous rewards.</p>
        <p>Leading off the appetizers was Coromandel's shamm savera, one of the chef's most original dishes: four tiny spinach cups filled with paneer (the bland, white Indian cheese) dumplings, surrounding a small mound of fluffy basmati rice, in a light, fresh tomato-honey sauce stippled with black mustard seeds: it was tangy and sweet.</p>
        <p>Imli baingan, thinly sliced, grilled eggplant, layered with onion, fresh cilantro and southern spices, had an oblique spicy undercurrent. Calamari Coromandel consisted of squid, lightly breaded and stir-fried with ginger, hot pepper pods, curry leaves, onions and green bell peppers. Like all the South India dishes we tried here this was richly seasoned, but the heat was modulated, not throat-clutchingly hot.</p>
        <p>Our entree successes were too many to describe them all. High points included pudugai eral varuval (big tiger prawns, lightly cooked, with coriander and onions in a thick, complex and spicy gravy), kodi vepudu (chicken tossed with onions, green chilies, ginger, garlic, gingeli and curry leaves in a zesty masala sauce) and the unusual Kerala vegetarian avial (crisp strips of potato, carrots, yams, eggplant and squash in a creamy, cumin-accented coconut-curd sauce). All entrees came with an abundance of scented basmati rice.</p>
        <p>Samundari toofan, a house specialty, was a whole 14-inch-long red snapper, moist, tender and redolent of time spent in a lemon juice-yogurt-ginger-garlic marinade. Its cavity and skin were rubbed with spices, and the fish was skewered and baked in a tandoor oven, then served on a bed of raw, thinly curled carrot and red onion, with a side helping of chickpeas, cauliflower and shiitake mushrooms.</p>
        <p>Coromandel's dishes from other regions were often as original and rewarding as the South Indian ones. For example, sagwala murgh, a Punjabi dish of bountiful chunks of chicken breast in a piquant spinach sauce, was delicious, as was the fiery Parsi kolmino patio (big tiger prawns and sharp green chilies in a velvety tomato-based sauce with heat tempered by a touch of sweet jaggery sugar). The Muslim-influenced darai combined tender lamb cubes with black gingeli (sesame) seeds and onions in a well-seasoned, savory sauce.</p>
        <p>Breads, including the crisp, fresh pappadums served with three chutneys on our arrival, were uniformly oven-hot, browned, light and puffy: notably onion kulcha (stuffed with onion, peppers and cilantro), garlic nan (with minced garlic and cilantro) and peshwari (with ground nuts, raisins and paneer inside).</p>
        <p>The clear winner among desserts was kheer, a creamy, rosewater-perfumed rice pudding with almonds, sultana raisins and cardamom seeds: a cool, delicate and refreshing finale to a beautifully seasoned meal.</p>
        <p>Dinner for two came to $59, including extras like raita, chutney and nan, but not drinks, tax or tip. There is a full bar, small wine list (beginning at $18) and several compatible beers and ales.</p>
        <p>Coromandel is tiny, but it packs a wallop in several ways: in its airy, attractive decor, welcoming service, generous portions and, most importantly, in the originality, diversity and high gastronomic standards of its food. Much to praise, too little to fault.</p>
        <p>Coromandel  25-11 Old Kings Highway North  (Goodwives Shopping Center), Darien; (203) 662-1213.</p>
