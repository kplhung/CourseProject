        <p>Darrell Cabey, who was awarded $43 million by a jury for his injuries from being shot by Bernard H. Goetz in a Manhattan subway train in 1984, has not received that money from Mr. Goetz. Mr. Cabey and three others were shot by Mr. Goetz, an electrical engineer, while riding the subway. Mr. Goetz, who used an unlicensed handgun, told the police that he feared the young men were going to rob him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cabey, the most seriously wounded, was paralyzed and suffered brain damage. Mr. Goetz was acquitted of assault and attempted murder in 1987 but was convicted on a weapons possession charge. In 1996 a civil jury found the shooting unjustified and awarded Mr. Cabey $43 million. Mr. Goetz later filed for bankruptcy, but a judge said he still had to pay his victim.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cabey's lawyer, Ronald L. Kuby, said that he has retained a law firm that specializes in debt collection to pursue Mr. Goetz who, he said, ''appears to be living in voluntary squalor, still on the West Side.''</p>
        <p>Reached by telephone, Mr. Goetz declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cabey's mother, Shirley, had known all along that there was little chance of getting money from Mr. Goetz, Mr. Kuby said.  ''It was very important to her, all those years, that people know that her son never did anything wrong to Bernard Goetz, that Bernard Goetz was the criminal,'' he explained. ''That's what the verdict established, and it gave her a tremendous sense of well being.''</p>
