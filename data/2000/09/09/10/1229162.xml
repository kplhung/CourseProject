        <p>JOE BERLINGER, a respected documentary filmmaker who was itching to make his first fictional feature, was delivering his pitch to the executives at Artisan Entertainment last Thanksgiving, thinking everything was going just fine.</p>
        <p>''I seemed to be doing well,'' he said. ''At least I kept meeting more and more people. Then gradually I realized that it wasn't the movie I was there pitching that interested them. They were really looking at me because they wanted me to direct a sequel to 'The Blair Witch Project.' Of course, I was interested.''</p>
        <p>But it did come as a bit of a shock. ''I thought my first movie would be a small, independent feature that would maybe play at the Sundance Film Festival and get some attention,'' Mr. Berlinger said. ''Instead, I found myself committed to delivering a sequel to one of the most successful movies of all time, and I had 10 months to do it.''</p>
        <p>Flashback to the summer of 1999: Seemingly out of nowhere, ''The Blair Witch Project,'' an unheralded horror film shot on a minuscule budget, opened on a handful of screens and grew into one of the most bizarre movie sensations of the decade, both a summer blockbuster and a cultural phenomenon that rewrote the rules on how to make and market movies for young people in the Internet Age.</p>
        <p>Artisan had picked up the film at the  Sundance festival the previous January, after no other independent distribution company exhibited any interest. The joke at the time was that the only thing scary about ''The Blair Witch Project'' was that Artisan had paid $1 million for it.</p>
        <p>Few appreciated how cannily the filmmakers, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez (who are producers on the sequel), had used the Web as a creative and marketing tool to spin a supposedly true story about the disappearance of three young filmmakers in the Maryland woods. They blended fact and fiction and successfully convinced many young people that the story was true. They also came up with a brilliant way to turn their primary handicap, a budget of next to nothing, into an advantage -- by claiming their film, with its nausea-inducing hand-held camera moves and Salvation Army production values, looked that way because it was the raw video footage that had been left behind when the filmmakers disappeared.</p>
        <p>Web sites sprang up with additional ''interview footage'' and richly imagined back stories about the characters involved in the film and the legend that supposedly inspired it, all set in and around the actual town of Burkittsville, Md. The blending of fact and fiction went so far as to include using the real names of the actors in the film for their screen characters. And the poor town of Burkittsville suddenly found itself overrun with ''Blair Witch'' groupies, wandering around in the woods, trying to find the ''real'' places where the story had happened.</p>
        <p>Seeing as how the film made more than $150 million last summer, and was a subsequent hit on videotape and DVD, a sequel was inevitable. Mr. Myrick and Mr. Sanchez were the logical filmmakers to do it, but their company, Haxan Films, instead signed with Artisan to do ''Heart of Love,'' a comedy about a love cult (now tentatively scheduled for a summer 2001 release). The Haxan team does plan to direct the third ''Blair Witch'' movie, most likely a prequel to the original.</p>
        <p>No matter who does it, making a sequel to a hit film is one thing; making a sequel to a phenomenon is another.</p>
        <p>''The challenge was in walking a fine line in dealing with the fact that the first movie did what it did,'' said Amorette Jones, Artisan's executive vice president for worldwide marketing. ''We had to tip our hand and acknowledge that the first movie was out there. The challenge is allowing the second film to be related to the first, then letting it stand on its own independently. That's where Joe's skills as a filmmaker and his vision came in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlinger, 37, was best known for a trio of truly creepy documentaries ''Brother's Keeper'' in 1992, ''Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills'' in 1996 and ''Paradise Lost 2: Revelations'' earlier this year. All three were made with his partner, Bruce Sinofsky, who is not involved in the ''Blair Witch'' sequel. The two ''Paradise Lost'' films most clearly show why Mr. Berlinger appealed to Artisan. They are about the murders of several young children in a working-class small town in eastern Arkansas, and the documentary suggests that three local youths were convicted of the crimes on flimsy evidence involving their supposed interest in Satanism and the occult.</p>
        <p>''In choosing Joe, we knew, based on his past credits, that he'd have the right sensibility to bring to this,'' Ms. Jones said. Indeed, Mr. Berlinger said, he was struck immediately by the three sequel scripts that had been written before his involvement. ''They were very fine scripts,'' he said, but he thought they were headed in the wrong direction. ''All of them picked up at the moment that the first film ended,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The chief problem was that it asked audiences, once again, to believe that the first film was a documentary and it ignored what, to him, was the most fascinating aspect of the ''Blair Witch'' phenomenon: the cultural hysteria that the original film produced.</p>
        <p>S UCH a major pulling the wool over the eyes of America had taken place with the first film, and then been revealed,'' he said. ''I thought it was too much to ask the audience to suspend disbelief again.</p>
        <p>''And the original movie fascinated me mostly from the standpoint that the real little town of Burkittsville had been overrun to a degree that you can't believe. Thousands of people were going there every week, people who were convinced that there was some grain of truth in the Blair Witch legend. The town was unprepared to deal with this.''</p>
        <p>So his movie (with screenplay credit going to John Bokenkamp and Neal Stevens) is set in that real town at the time it is first inundated with ''Blair Witch'' groupies, in the weeks after the explosive success of the original movie. The original plan, in a nod to the original, was for the characters in the sequel to bear the same names as the actors who portray them. But the filmmakers decided to change the last names just to avoid confusion.</p>
        <p>Jeff Donovan plays Jeff Patterson, a local tour operator who takes ''Blair Witch'' tourists out into the woods where the original movie was filmed. In the sequel, he takes four young people (a pair of Boston academics, a nature-worshiping witch and a cynical Goth enthusiast) on such a tour, and they find themselves in the middle of the forest in the middle of the night when very odd things begin to happen.</p>
        <p>''My movie is about five obsessed movie fans who go to the real town of Burkittsville and sort of make a pilgrimage to the site,'' Mr. Berlinger said. ''But I am confident that what people expect to happen, even after the characters end up in the woods, is not what is going to happen. I think people will be surprised.''</p>
        <p>The film, with its $10 million budget, is inexpensive by the standards of most movies that are released on 3,000 screens, as ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' will be on Oct. 27. But it's a fortune compared with the original's budget. Mr. Berlinger said that the reason for the higher budget was that he had decided not to imitate the hand-held, low-budget look of the first film but to make a more traditional movie with more mainstream production values. The first film was also noticeably gore-free, for a horror film, largely because of budgetary constraints; the sequel will raise  the ante a bit in this category, Mr. Berlinger said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donovan said that audiences would have trouble guessing where the plot of the sequel was headed. ''People expect it to be a romp in the  woods, with some kids going crazy-scared in a tent,'' he said. ''But it's not going to be anything like the first one or like people expect. Instead, it's a movie about mass hysteria and collective delusion.''</p>
        <p>Erica Leerhsen, who plays Erica Geerson, the young witch in the film, said that she had resisted going to see the original. ''I knew it was a big deal,'' she said. ''I'm the kind of person who doesn't necessarily want to follow hype, if you know what I mean. I purposely don't go see something for that reason. So I waited until the hype kind of died down and went to see it, and I was so scared.''</p>
        <p>She went to an audition in New York for the sequel and found herself  surrounded by ''millions of people'' trying out for the key parts. ''They asked me, what was the scariest thing that had happened to me, so I came up with spiders and how I thought I was going to die because I had to be around these spiders one time,'' Ms. Leerhsen said. ''Then, they had me back and Joe was there and they asked me the same question again. So I had to come up with something new. And they kept having me back and back, with fewer and fewer people each time, until it was just me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlinger said that the key trick, for him, was to come up with something that interested him intellectually and was still satisfying to the fans of the original film, breaking the mold of the first film while remaining true to its spirit. So he decided once again to blend fact and fiction, to have a resolution that is vague -- at least subject to interpretation -- and to have the idea of ''found footage'' play a role in the story.</p>
        <p>''I am fascinated by the notion most Americans have, when they consume media, that shaky camera means reality,'' Mr. Berlinger said. ''That's a dangerous thing. It's utterly fascinating to me that to most people amateur video equals reality. It taps into a larger issue, a real concern of mine, the blurring in general between fiction and reality, between news and entertainment. Over the last decade, they've become so intertwined.''</p>
        <p>Whether ''Blair Witch'' fanatics will appreciate the film on this level, he is not sure, but Mr. Berlinger said he was convinced they wouldn't have to. The movie works as a traditional horror-mystery, without the intellectual overlay, he said.</p>
        <p>''The thing I just decided early on was that I needed to stick to my vision,'' he said. ''I hope it plays for America. I think it will. We'll see.</p>
        <p>''Opportunities come in all shapes and sizes. You can't really pick and  choose your moment of destiny, so I just jumped out the window and hoped, as I continue to hope, that there's a mattress on the other side to catch me.''</p>
        <p>FILM: EVIL LURKING  Correction:  October 8, 2000, Sunday  An article on Sept. 10 about the film ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' misidentified the writers who are to receive screen credit.
