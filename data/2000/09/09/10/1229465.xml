        <p>Jose Ramirez, 17, and his cousin Paul Suazo, 16, spun down Amsterdam Avenue on their bikes. They bounced over the cracked pavement, dodging the trucks and cars, many of them with their windows open and Latino rhythms thumping from the sound systems, until they reached 179th Street.</p>
        <p>There they stopped. They had traveled to Washington Heights from 170th Street and Townsend Avenue in the Bronx, and now they surveyed the objects of their desire.</p>
        <p>Nine white food trucks lay snugly tucked along the curb on Amsterdam from 172nd Street to 179th Street. The glare of lamps, fixed on the trucks' sides, bathed the sidewalks. And the last truck in the row was resplendent in the glow of a neon sign hanging on its side.</p>
        <p>The teenagers walked past the cooks who leaned over counters where an array of boiled and fried meats, along with specialties from the Dominican Republic, like fried yuca and meat patties, were stacked behind plexiglass windows. They halted in front of a truck named La Vecina, or the Neighbor, run by Ana Betances, 36.</p>
        <p>Asked why they didn't go to food trucks in the Bronx, Mr. Suazo said, ''That's a good idea, Jose.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramirez replied, ''But they don't have any trucks like these in the Bronx.''</p>
        <p>The food trucks that attracted the two teenagers have been a fixture in the Washington Heights Dominican neighborhood for more than a decade. But a little over a month ago, the police, responding to complaints by residents about late-night noise, the constant smell of fried food, an increase in the rat population and parking problems, ordered the trucks away from sites that many had occupied for years.</p>
        <p>The trucks were herded onto Amsterdam Avenue, where, because they now compete next to one another, sales have dipped. Vendors said their average earnings, which had been about $500 a week, have fallen to $200 or $300.</p>
        <p>There are rumors among the owners that the Health Department and other city agencies will inspect the trucks, which may violate restaurant or fire safety codes, tomorrow, according to Freddie Rodriguez, 38, who called himself the secretary general of a drivers' group, Trucks of the 33rd Precinct.</p>
        <p>''Everyone is afraid,'' said Mr. Rodriguez, who was ousted from a spot on Audubon Avenue that he had occupied for eight years. ''Five or six families live off each of these trucks. All the trucks in the 33rd and 34th Precincts put five or six million dollars a year back into the community. The city should be a little more flexible.''</p>
        <p>Sandra Mullin, a Health Department spokeswoman, said she was unable to confirm whether there would be an inspection tomorrow. ''In general, when inspections are done of restaurants or food vendors, we don't let them know in advance,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Miguel Parata, 35, the owner of Restaurant Tenares, across the street from some of the newly arrived trucks, stood fuming amid his empty tables and said any raid could not come soon enough. Business, he said, has been disastrous since the arrival of the convoy camped out front.</p>
        <p>''The food they serve is dirty,'' he said. ''They cook a lot of it at home and carry it here, so it spoils. The gas lines they hook up are unsafe. The smells they give off stink. We pay taxes and have to meet health codes. Why are they special?''</p>
        <p>There is no shortage of Dominican restaurants in Washington Heights, but the trucks, which are modeled after ones in the Dominican Republic, hold a special appeal. The vendors stay open into the early morning hours and the vehicles, often named after the village the owner comes from, are a meeting point, especially for young men and women returning late at night from a club or discotheque.</p>
        <p>''It makes me feel like I am home,'' said Manny Mejia, 37, who had come from Queens. And, he added: ''When you go to a restaurant, even if it looks nice, you don't know how dirty the kitchen is or if there are rats running around. Here you can peek over the counter to make sure it is clean. And anyway, we do not like all this formality of eating and sitting at tables.''</p>
        <p>The truck that is the envy of all the owners is El Peluche, or Teddy Bear, which parks at 10th Avenue and 207th Street. It is nearly twice the size of its rivals, has a second truck that houses its freezers and is covered with neon signs, including one of a teddy bear. Its menu, deluxe by the standards of truck vendors, includes nine kinds of tropical juices. The police ordered it off Nagle Avenue a month ago, but, to the relief of the vendors along Amsterdam, gave it its own berth more than a mile away from them.</p>
        <p>''El Peluche is what truck owners aspire to be,'' said Danny Tavarez, 19, who works in a boxy white vehicle on Amsterdam Avenue with his father and mother.</p>
        <p>But El Peluche also has potent enemies.</p>
        <p>''We have been torched three times,'' said Luis Sanchez, 26, the night manager and a cousin of the owner. ''The last time was a year ago, when someone pulled up in an old car filled with cans of gasoline and set it alight. Anonymous notes get slipped under our door telling us to shut down. It has got to be jealousy. Someone out there does not want the competition.''</p>
