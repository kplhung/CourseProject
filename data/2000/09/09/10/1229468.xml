        <p>Tiger Woods made plenty of birdies today, but he had plenty of company on the leader board.</p>
        <p>With an eight-under-par 64, including six birdies and an eagle, Woods moved into a first-place tie with Grant Waite heading into Sunday's final round of the Bell Canadian Open. Woods and Waite were both 15 under par (201) for the tournament, a stroke ahead of Stephen Ames and J. L. Lewis.</p>
        <p>But there were 20 players at nine under or better, meaning the final round could be a wide-open shootout, particularly if conditions remain near perfect for scoring. With the greens softened by Friday's rain, and with many of the par-5 holes playing downwind, players fired at the pins today as if taking target practice.</p>
        <p>Ames shot a nine-under-par 63, nearly tying the course record of 62 at Glen Abbey Golf Club held by three others. Thirty-five of the 73 players broke 70, and if they were not making birdies, they were losing ground, like Sergio Garcia, who shot 70 and was 10 under for the tournament, or Davis Love III, who shot 71 playing with Woods, leaving Love at eight under, seven strokes behind.</p>
        <p>So with 18 holes left, it was difficult not to like Woods's chances. He has won 19 consecutive PGA Tour events when he has held or shared the lead after three rounds. He has won five of his last seven starts, including three major championships.</p>
        <p>With eight victories this year, and with many of Woods's pursuers unaccustomed to being in contention, Woods has an excellent chance to join Lee Trevino (1971) as the only players to win the United States Open, the British Open and the Canadian Open in the same year. It would be another milestone in an incredible year for Woods. But after seeing so many low scores today, Woods was taking nothing for granted.</p>
        <p>''A lot of those guys haven't won many tournaments, but you never know,'' he said. ''If conditions remain the same, you're going to have to make birdies to win.''</p>
        <p>Making birdies was not a problem for the leaders today. Woods started his day well, making birdies on two of the first three holes, followed by another birdie at No. 8 that came in most unusual fashion. Woods hit a wild tee shot into the gallery right of the fairway. His ball bounced off the head of a spectator, Michael Donley of Ontario, and ricocheted 40 feet left, back into the fairway.</p>
        <p>Woods walked over to check on Donley, who was not bleeding and who told Woods that he was O.K.</p>
        <p>''I just felt bad for him,'' Woods said. ''When I first got over there, he didn't seem like he was all there.''</p>
        <p>But Woods took advantage of the favorable head bounce, hitting his approach shot 3 feet from the pin to set up an easy birdie. After birdies on Nos. 11 and 13, Woods reached his favorite stretch, the final four holes. On Friday, Woods had a remarkable birdie-eagle-birdie-eagle stretch from No. 15 through No. 18.</p>
        <p>Today was not as good, but it was not bad. Woods birdied the par-3 No. 15 again, making a 12-foot putt, then he made eagle again at the par-5 No. 16, reaching the green in two shots and sinking a 15-foot putt. But at the par-4 No. 17, Woods settled for par, and he also made par at the par-5 finishing hole. After Woods's second shot at No. 18 went into a greenside bunker, he flubbed his next shot, leaving the ball in the bunker.</p>
        <p>''I tried to get too cute with it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Woods then got up and down from the bunker for par, but he was forced to share the lead with Waite, who started the day with a one-stroke lead and who managed to shoot 68 today despite struggling on the front nine. A native of New Zealand, Waite has not won on tour since 1993, and he has never played with Woods in the final round of a tournament.</p>
        <p>''The only time I played with Tiger was when he was 17 years old, when I could beat him,'' Waite said. ''I can't hit the shots he hits, but Bob May proved at the P.G.A. that it doesn't matter who you are, if you post a good score, he'll have to play well to beat you.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Ames said there were no hard feelings between himself and Woods after an incident this spring. Ames was quoted as saying that Woods thought he was bigger than the tour, but Ames said he was misquoted, and he apologized to Woods months ago. ''I sent him a letter and I apologized to him in Dallas,'' said Ames, who could have tied the course record had he birdied No. 18. ''I don't think we're going to have our boxing gloves on.''</p>
        <p>But Woods had again accomplished what he wanted: putting himself in position to win. Almost any player would be thrilled to win three national Opens in a career. But Woods has a chance to win three in one year.</p>
