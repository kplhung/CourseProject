        <p>A CASINO in Bridgeport would create 7,500 full-time and temporary construction jobs, pump $650 million of revenue a year into the Fairfield County region's already vibrant economy, and would create a demand in ancillary industries of $350 million.</p>
        <p>If run by a Native American tribe, as at Foxwoods and the Mohegan Sun, a 150,000 square-foot casino in Bridgeport with 5,000 gaming positions, 125 table games and 3,500 slot machines would also generate nearly $100 million for the state of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>But it would also result in an additional 29,700 vehicle trips traveling along the already congested I-95 on a typical Friday during the worst time period possible -- the 4-8 p.m. evening rush hour -- and extend that heavy traffic by several more hours.</p>
        <p>A Bridgeport casino would also have a devastating impact on air quality -- with pollution becoming so bad it would be tough to comply with acceptable levels of pollution under the Federal Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>Those were the two conflicting views presented to about 75 realtors, bankers and businesses executives at a seminar last week in Stamford by the local branch of the Real Estate Finance Association on how a Bridgeport casino would help Fairfield County's economy, but hurt its over-burdened infrastructure and surrounding environment along the coast. Over the years, there have been a handful of proposals to build a casino in the city, none of which have been approved.</p>
        <p>Entitled ''Native Americans, Gaming and Fairfield County,'' the breakfast seminar brought together a panel of casino supporters and detractors, as well as a Native American chief from Kent who explained his tribe's quest for federal recognition and what that could mean to its chances to someday operate a casino.</p>
        <p>''The decade of the 90's saw Native American gaming come full circle. During that 10-year period, Native American casinos evolved from high stakes bingo with pull tabs, some card rooms and some slot machines -- legal or illegal -- to the successful development of some of the largest casino resorts in the United States,'' said Mickey Brown, former president and chief executive of Foxwood Resorts Casino in Ledyard and now a lawyer in Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>''The distinction between Indian casinos and the commercial casino industry is fading and becoming less and less obvious,'' Mr. Brown said. ''But I want to tell you how the development of another Native American casino in Connecticut would impact the present economy and its overall affect upon western Connecticut.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said a casino in Bridgeport would likely result in annual gross revenues of $660 million for the casino, and stimulate the region's economy with sales of items such as food and beverage purchases, marketing, utilities, entertainment, repair and maintenance and administration. He said all costs excluding wages would be in the range of about $170 million. He said employees would be paid more than $136 million in annual wages and benefits.</p>
        <p>''Casino jobs are new jobs created where none previously existed,'' said Mr. Brown. ''Because the business is highly labor intense and operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the casino business becomes a substantial employer immediately. To sum up, casinos import money. At Foxwoods we did over $1 billion in revenue during my last year there.''</p>
        <p>Joseph McGee, vice president of the South Western Regional Planning Agency, said he told the group that a casino in Bridgeport would greatly worsen an already existing daily traffic nightmare along Interstate 95 and the Merritt Parkway.</p>
        <p>''In just 10 years the number of vehicle miles per day on I-95 has increased 30,000 miles to 128,000 vehicle miles per day,'' Mr. McGee said. ''And even without a casino those numbers are going to keep increasing by nearly 2 percent a year. With a casino, all of these problems -- traffic, air pollution, the deteriorating infrastructure -- will be greatly exacerbated.''</p>
        <p>Richard L. Velkey, chief of the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation in Kent, said just as the more well-known Golden Hill Paugussetts, his tribe continues its long quest for federal recognition so that it may one day operate a casino in Bridgeport. But Mr. Velkey said because of a complex system regarding the federal tribal recognition process, he is not sure the region or state is ready for another casino.</p>
        <p>''Here in Fairfield County and across Connecticut municipalities have no way of properly planning for future development,'' Mr. Velkey said. ''This broken process is not only a source of frustration for the Schaghticoke, but it raises serious questions as to how many tribes will win federal recognition, when it will happen, and how state local federal and tribal leaders can work together to assure that the end result will benefit citizens and not create a situation that will negatively impact our community.''</p>
