        <p>Pop Art and Imagism</p>
        <p>Post-World War II art in Chicago differed markedly from art in New York during the same period, says a curator at the Whitney Museum in Stamford. New York artists were into abstraction while those in Chicago were focused on the human body and other things.</p>

        <p>Pop Art and Imagism</p>
        <p>Post-World War II art in Chicago differed markedly from art in New York during the same period, says a curator at the Whitney Museum in Stamford. New York artists were into abstraction while those in Chicago were focused on the human body and other things.</p>
        <p>Cynthia Roznoy, curator of ''Chicago Loop: Imagist Art 1949-1979,'' opening at the Whitney on Friday, said, ''common and coarse material appealed to these Chicago artists, including graffiti, circus banners, penny arcade games, tattoo parlors, striptease joints and amusement parks.''</p>
        <p>Pop Art in New York was slick and objective, she continued, while Imagism in Chicago was subjective and rude.</p>
        <p>In the film ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' a painting depicting an image of a desicated and depraved Dorian shocked audiences.</p>
        <p>It was painted by Ivan Albright, one of 25 artists who are represented by 60 works in the exhibition. Among them is his self-portrait, every bit as frightening as his portrait of Dorian.</p>
        <p>Not all of the works are so grim. ''Armpits,'' by Karl Wirsum, uses strategically placed tufts of fur for humor and Gladys Nilsson's ''Many Swingers Out of Doors'' depicts rubbery figures in a fantasy watercolor world.</p>
        <p>This unusually idiosyncratic exhibition remains through Dec. 15 with viewing hours on Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and gallery talks on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 12:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>The museum is at the corner of Atlantic Street and Tresser Boulevard. Admission and parking in the garage on Tresser Boulevard are free.</p>
        <p>The number to call for more information is (203) 358-7630.</p>
        <p>In Marian Anderson's Honor</p>
        <p>Marian Anderson, Danbury's favorite daughter, is to be honored on Thursday with a celebration of her legacy. The event, which is admission free, will be held at the Danbury Music Center's Marian Anderson Recital Hall, 246 Main Street.</p>
        <p>Following an hourlong reception at 5:30 p.m., Dr. Allan Keiler, professor of music at Brandeis University and author of ''Marian Anderson: A Singer's Journey,'' will talk about the legendary singer's life in Danbury and her performance in 1939 in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, a turning point in the civil rights movement. Artifacts and memorabilia associated with her will be on display and a video of her performances will be shown.</p>
        <p>The recital hall will now be included in the Housatonic Valley Tourism District's Freedom Trail.</p>
        <p>Men's Garden Club</p>
        <p>Today marks the 50th year that male gardeners of the Greater Bridgeport area display asters, zinnias, zucchini, apples, herbs and the best of numerous crops they have grown in the annual Greater Bridgeport Men's Garden Club Harvest Show. It is from noon to 5 p.m. at the Sterling House Community Center, 2283 Main Street in Stratford.</p>
        <p>Admission is free and so is advice, so bring your tired plants to these gentlemen for helpful advice.</p>
        <p>Steve Forbert in Stamford</p>
        <p>Steve Forbert made his living in the 70's driving a truck in Mississippi, but by the 80's he was making waves in Manhattan's folk-rock venues. As he sang original songs, played his guitar and harmonica, he passed through a period of ins and outs with a succession of record labels. In the 90's he found his own sound, incorporating folk-rock with country and rhythm and blues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbert will give a single performance on Saturday at 8 p.m. in the Acoustic Studio of the Rich Forum in Stamford at 307 Atlantic Street. Tickets at $18 may be reserved by calling (203) 325-4466.</p>
        <p>Navaratri Festival</p>
        <p>A weeklong series of concerts and workshops focused on the music of North and South India are scheduled in the 24th Annual Navaratri Festival at Wesleyan University in Middletown.</p>
        <p>A major music and dance festival in India, the name Navaratri means nine (nava) nights (ratri), the traditional length of the celebration honoring the goddess Durga.</p>
        <p>The Tiruppamparam Brothers are coming from India to perform on Tuesday in Crowell Concert Hall where all the concerts are to be held at 8 p.m. They will play South Indian music on the nagaswaram, an instrument similar to an oboe, and the tavil, a double-headed drum.</p>
        <p>Musicians from India and members of Wesleyan's music faculty will join Professor T. Viswanathan on Wednesday for a performance of South Indian music played on the bamboo flute, violin, mridangam (tunable barrel drum) and kanjira, a tambourine-like drum. Indian-western fusion music is also on the program.</p>
        <p>North Indian dhrupas music, a seldom performed style, will be played on Thursday by the cellist Nancy Lesh, with Peter Fagiola on the pakhwaj, a hand drum. Zakir Hussain and L. Shankar, playing the tabla and double-necked violin, will perform raga (melody) and tala (rhythm) on Friday, and Saturday's performance will feature the Natyakalalayam Dance Company.</p>
        <p>For more information about workshops and additional performances, or to order tickets priced from $5 to $15 call (860) 685-3355.</p>
        <p>Boating Courses</p>
        <p>Flotilla 72 of the Coast Guard Auxiliary offers boating courses to the public each fall at the Dominic Lametta Training Center, on Calf Pasture Beach in East Norwalk.</p>
        <p>A 10-session, weekly course on basic coastal navigation begins on Wednesday from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. The fee is $50 for study materials. Boating skills and seamanship will follow on Thursdays from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m., starting Sept. 21. The materials fee is $45.</p>
        <p>Instruction is applicable to both sail and power boats, covering safety gear, piloting and charting, navigation rules, trailering, tying of lines and knots, marine radio and weather. Graduates will have met state requirements for safe-boating certificates. The number to call for more information is (203) 966-8007.</p>
        <p>Westport Antiques Show</p>
        <p>Affordable prices are the hallmark of the Westport Chamber of Commerce's Outdoor Antiques Show and Sale.
