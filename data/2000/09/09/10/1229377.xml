        <p>RAJEEV BHAMAN was born in Bombay, has lived in England and was educated in the United States. As a teenager, he traveled the world with his father, the captain of a cargo ship. So he is not fazed by the travel required in his job, running the $170.8 million Oppenheimer Developing Markets fund.</p>
        <p>''I find it exhilarating,'' Mr. Bhaman said recently from his office in the World Trade Center in Manhattan. ''Exploring the differences and similarities among cultures, new places and new ideas is like being a detective. I'm sort of like Carmen San Diego.'' He has managed the fund since its inception in November 1996.</p>
        <p>His travels have paid off for the fund's investors. The fund returned 11.88 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Sept. 7, putting it in first place among diversified emerging-markets funds, according to Morningstar Inc. Over all, the group had a 3.84 percent loss, annualized.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bhaman, 36, uses a bottom-up approach to investing, looking for companies with strong growth prospects in emerging foreign markets. He screens the 15,000 companies in that universe down to 1,000 by focusing on market and industry trends that he thinks will fuel global growth over the next 20 years.</p>
        <p>His most important theme is what he calls ''mass affluence,'' which, he said, is grounded in the increasing consumption of brand-name, personal-care and disposable products, as well as appetites for entertainment and education. ''It's incredible how quickly emerging markets have become consumer-driven economies,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Two more key themes are new technologies and restructuring. ''Most of Eastern Europe is a restructuring story, the transformation of unprofitable, state-owned enterprises to cash-generating, profitable companies,'' Mr. Bhaman said.  ''We think of it as a caterpillar that metamorphoses into a butterfly.''</p>
        <p>He owns a mix of value and growth stocks of all sizes in many industries around the world. The diversification helps reduce the volatility of emerging markets and other risks like currency fluctuations. The fund's prospectus says it can hedge its currency, but he said that is unnecessary for long-term investments.</p>
        <p>His investments are concentrated in Latin America and in Asia outside Japan (36.6 percent each) and Eastern Europe (14.7 percent).</p>
        <p>To pick the fund's 60 to 80 stocks, Mr. Bhaman uses fundamental research to find what he calls ''good companies with good businesses at good prices.'' A good company, he said, fits one of his themes and has returns that exceed its cost of capital over the next three to five years.</p>
        <p>A good price lets him double his money in three years, Mr. Bhaman said, or triple it in five.</p>
        <p>Equally important is a shareholder-friendly environment. ''The emerging markets are characterized by poorer shareholder protection laws than in the developed markets,'' he said, ''and less efficient information flow.''</p>
        <p>He spends at least 25 percent of his time on international travel, he said, visiting more than 300 companies a year. He talks to local suppliers, distributors and customers to evaluate whether a company's stock price reflects what he thinks is its potential.</p>
        <p>Many investments are in companies with operations focused on their home countries, Mr. Bhaman said, because they are generally better aligned with local consumer desires and specific cultural attributes than large multinational corporations.</p>
        <p>He pores over financial statements, particularly focusing on a company's free cash flow, as well as its ability to generate cash in the future. He also reviews returns on equity, assets and capital.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bhaman sells shares when they become fully valued, or when a company's fundamentals start to deteriorate.</p>
        <p>MR. BHAMAN'S biggest holding is preferred shares of Embraer S.A., of Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil. The company, which makes small regional jets and was formerly owned by the government, was privatized and recapitalized in 1995. He bought shares in March 1998 at 1.76 Brazilian reais, or 97 cents.</p>
        <p>The company's growth prospects are strong, he said, because more countries are building smaller airports and need smaller airplanes.  ''Smaller planes are better suited for lower-volume traffic at cost-competitive prices,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On Friday, shares closed at 11.9  reais, or 10.8 times his projected earnings of 1.1 per share this year.</p>
        <p>Another favorite is Grupo Televisa, a Mexico City television broadcaster with a substantial Spanish-language publishing operation and satellite and cable TV businesses. It is also a leading supplier of Spanish-language programming to the United States.</p>
        <p>''As the level of affluence increases, the company is well positioned to take advantage of increased advertising rates on television,'' he said, ''and to sell programming to other parts of the world at higher prices.'' A recent cost-cutting program, he added, should increase profit margins.</p>
        <p>He bought shares in July 1997 at $30. They closed on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at $67.25 each, or 44.8 times his 2000 earnings estimate of $1.50 a share.</p>
        <p>He also likes LG Home Shopping, the larger of two Korean home shopping networks. Although many Koreans are comfortable using the Internet, Mr. Bhaman said, ''most of the people who buy are women over 30, and TV is a friendlier medium than computers for this group.''</p>
        <p>In June, he bought shares at 90,000 won ($81.42) each. On Friday, they closed at 185,500 won, or 37.1 times his 2000 earnings projection of 5,000 won a share.</p>
