        <p>Penn St. 67, La. Tech 7</p>
        <p>Rashard Casey threw a school-record-tying five touchdown passes as Penn State took out its frustrations on Louisiana Tech with a 67-7 home victory yesterday.</p>
        <p>Casey, benched in season-opening losses to Southern Cal and Toledo, had touchdown passes of 5 and 2 yards to Eric McCoo, 10 to Tony Stewart, 35 to Tony Johnson, and 13 to Steve Delich.</p>
        <p>''It felt good to finally get in a rhythm,'' Casey said. ''It was a lot of relief. But there's still going to be critics, regardless.''</p>
        <p>He almost didn't make it through the first quarter, however. Casey angered coach Joe Paterno by taking two sacks on the opening series, and fumbling once.</p>
        <p>After the ominous start, Penn State, which had one touchdown in two games, scored four in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Cincinnati 12  Syracuse 10</p>
        <p>Jason Mammarelli kicked a 47-yard field on the final play of the game to lift host Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Ruffin had three fourth-quarter field goals before giving way to the strong-legged Mammarelli for the winning kick. Mike Shafer had kicked a 35-yard field goal with 43 seconds left to give Syracuse (1-1) a 10-9 lead.</p>
        <p>Ruffin's field goals of 28, 42 and 32 yards put Cincinnati (2-0) ahead for the first time, the last of the three coming with 4 minutes 37 seconds to play.</p>
        <p>Syracuse then put together a 12-play drive leading to Shafer's field goal and the short-lived lead.</p>
        <p>Fordham 34, Fairfield 7</p>
        <p>The freshman Mike Mucci passed for one touchdown and rushed for another as host Fordham ended the longest losing streak in Division I-AA at 12 games.</p>
        <p>Fordham lost all 11 games last year and its season opener last Saturday to Towson.</p>
        <p>Mucci making his debut, was 12 of 21 for 207 yards with 4 interceptions.</p>
        <p>St. John's 23  St. Francis 0</p>
        <p>Josh Krapf passed for one touchdown and ran for another as St. John's beat visiting St. Francis (Pa.) in the season opener for both teams.</p>
        <p>The Red Storm, making their Northeast Conference debut, held St. Francis to 72 yards of total offense. St. John's ranked first in Division I-AA in total defense last season.</p>
        <p>Connecticut 37  Colgate 7</p>
        <p>Ryan Tracey threw for 327 yards and 2 touchdowns for Division I newcomer UConn.</p>
        <p>Tracey, a junior college transfer from California, completed 25 of 35 passes in his second solid start for the Huskies (1-1). His 340-yard performance in last week's loss to Eastern Michigan was the most ever by a UConn quarterback in his first game.</p>
        <p>IN OTHER GAMES</p>
        <p>Brian Westbrook broke VILLANOVA's career scoring record and scored a career-high four touchdowns to reach 262 points and lead the Wildcats over visiting MILLERSVILLE, 51-14. . . . Aaron Smith threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Chuck Kingsley with 31 seconds left in the first half as host WAGNER beat MONMOUTH, 14-7.</p>
