        <p>Science of measuring changes in global climate and determining what part of it is natural and what the result of human activity remains in the realm of nuanced, statistical fuzziness, not in the black-and-white world most policy makers would prefer; most scientists say balance of data now firmly points toward conclusion that people, through their impact on the atmosphere, are influencing climate now and will have even more impact in coming years unless societies figure out a way to deal with a problem that lacks the attributes of a crisis; photo (M)</p>

        <p>THEY have been under siege for quite some time. This summer in Swaziland, they were identified as a reason for the spread of AIDS and banned from schools. In the past, they have been eliminated from government offices by the likes of former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia, who saw them as signs of Western influence, and purged by Idi Amin in Uganda. In 1967, the legendary designer Edith Head, who felt they lacked elegance, banned them from the Academy Awards.</p>
        <p>They are miniskirts, and they are dangerous.</p>
        <p>Apparently so dangerous that Congo's president, Laurent Kabila, made it his first act to get rid of miniskirts when he overthrew the dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997.</p>
        <p>Why do politicians turn their attention away from the oppressed and focus instead on the underdressed? And how does a brief bit of fabric cause so much consternation?</p>
        <p>The scapegoating of the miniskirt serves as a reminder that when fashion rules, actual rulers get nervous. The idea that the right uniform can convey a world view or allegiance has always inspired social snobs, awards show consultants and armies. But the notion that the enemy can be identified by his clothes is an especially comforting one in the realm of politics, since it's a lot easier to get people to change their clothes than to change their minds.</p>
        <p>In the political world, costumes get taken quite literally, as if life were a Victorian melodrama in which villains wear black and heroes wear white, with no attempts at disguise. And everyday clothing poses an even greater danger than theatrical or military costume. Political leaders see fashion as a second language that can be spoken by just about anyone. So they try to crack its codes, monitor its messages and cultivate its secrets for themselves.</p>
        <p>On the opposite end of the political spectrum from the mini, the most widely persecuted piece of cloth these days is the Islamic head scarf. For some, covered hair can be as scandalous as naked legs. Last year, the Turkish Parliament shocked many Westerners by ejecting a legislator for wearing a traditional hijab to her swearing-in ceremony. To outsiders, the scarf seemed like a bid for religious freedom. But to the fiercely secular Turks, the scarf spoke to a history of oppression, and wearing it to work in Parliament would probably be like showing up in the United States Senate in Confederate flag earrings.</p>
        <p>Regimes that scapegoat clothing give new meaning to the concept of the fashion victim. In 1994, 20 Muslim girls were expelled from schools in France for wearing head scarves. In Afghanistan this July, a visiting group of Pakistani soccer players had their heads shaved in public as punishment for wearing shorts instead of long pants. In Swaziland, it was not only the skirts but the schoolgirls in them who were blamed for behaving seductively around their teachers. The Swaziland government had first attempted to get rid of miniskirts in 1969, but had trouble enforcing the law. Now, AIDS has been used to justify the directive. So it is that a tiny African nation can blame a tiny skirt for an international health problem.</p>
        <p>Since fashion itself can seem unscientific, those who would create or reform fashions often deploy science. Even Oscar Wilde, often thought of as a whimsical dresser, argued that fashion ought to be grounded in serious, objective principles. ''The right laws of dress,'' Wilde wrote in support of Victorian dress reform, ''are dictated . . . by science and not by fashion.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the reformers who recently persuaded the Iranian government that girls should be permitted to wear pastels in addition to dark colors had to give reasons relating to the girls' physical and mental health. They cited, for example, the threat of osteoporosis from Vitamin D deficiencies caused by sunlight-blocking black chadors.</p>
        <p>And in France, hygiene is given as the reason for an intriguing swimming-pool dress code: men must wear skin-tight Speedos rather than baggy swimming trunks to swim in most public pools. While this may seem like a Continental fashion preference, like bathing topless, or possibly the result of some chic French bureaucrat's disdain for American-style boxers, it is explained as an issue of cleanliness. The logic goes: longer bathing suits can pass for shorts, may be worn in potentially unclean public areas and so could be trailing dirt or germs.</p>
        <p>Anyone shocked by the arbitrary, dictatorial bans of skirts that are too short or bathing suits that are too long must consider the alternative -- legislating the leg. What if knees were subjected to a democratic vote? This summer, the Bermuda Parliament voted itself the right to come to work in Bermuda shorts. Luckily the shorts are a symbol of national pride and so avoided getting vetoed in the backlash against casual Fridays. According to a recent poll, the number of American companies that allow casual dress, which had risen steadily to 97 percent in 1998, declined this year for the first time since 1992, to 87 percent. Anyone made too lazy by casual dress codes can now look forward to ''Dress Up Thursdays,'' a plot to sell men's suits.</p>
        <p>Even in America, where dressing outrageously seems a natural right, there are those who believe you are what you wear -- notably Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, known both for writing that provocative dressing may lead to sexual harassment (Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson) and for adding four stripes of gold braid to the arms of his robe for a more magisterial look.</p>
        <p>In the presidential campaign, the politics of fashion have gotten ugly. First, Vice President Al Gore's critics accused him of getting a fashion makeover. The vice president had a problem. It looked as if Gov. George W. Bush would easily outdress him. Even Mr. Bush's clothes have presidential lineage: not only does W. look great in custom-made suits, he uses the same tailor who dressed Lyndon B. Johnson. Meanwhile, if Mr. Gore slipped up and wore a single earth tone, commentators would say he wasn't his own man, which is a shame because earth tones are some of the vice president's best colors.</p>
        <p>But at the Democratic convention, the fashion crisis was averted. In the opening-night video, world leaders kept extolling President Clinton, while President Clinton kept wearing a tuxedo, radiating elegance and national prosperity. Then Vice President Gore showed up, dressed in red, white and blue. Dressing like a flag has always been a key to winning national elections. And saying you're your own man while wrapped in the colors of the flag -- it doesn't get much better than that.</p>
