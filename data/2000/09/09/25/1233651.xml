        <p>A referendum to cut the French president's term of  office from seven to five years was overwhelmingly approved today though a record number of voters did not bother to cast a ballot.</p>
        <p>The shortened term, the most radical change to France's Constitution in 40 years, was approved by 73.2 percent of those who cast a ballot for or against, according to provisional results. But only 30 percent of those eligible voted, the lowest turnout ever.</p>
        <p>A low turnout had been expected as surveys in recent weeks showed that the issue had failed to capture the interest of many voters. Some said the issue was too complex. But others said they were being asked to vote on an issue that was of interest only to politicians, far afield from  pressing concerns like high taxes and the cost of fuel.</p>
        <p>Indeed, even some who voted went out of their way to express disdain for the referendum. Eighteen percent of those who showed up, more than 1.8 million voters, did not vote but instead returned empty envelopes or envelopes stuffed with a ripped-up ballot.</p>
        <p>Soon after the polling places  closed, President Jacques Chirac -- who before making an about-face this June had always vehemently opposed the five-year term -- went on television to say he wanted France to hold more referendums in future, despite the poor turnout.</p>
        <p>''Abstention does not mean that there are too many referendums or too much democracy, but on the contrary that there are not enough,'' he said. He admitted, however, that many voters were more interested in  job creation and tax relief.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, a Socialist who is expected to run against Mr. Chirac in the 2002 presidential race, said he wished that more people had voted but was still happy with the result. Mr. Jospin has always supported the reform, which will bring the French presidency more in line with the rest of Europe.</p>
        <p>The five-year term will not affect Mr. Chirac, who will finish out his seven-year term, but will begin with the 2002 elections.</p>
        <p>The shorter term -- which will put parliamentary and presidential elections on the same five-year schedule -- has been debated in France for nearly 30 years. Supporters have argued that the seven-year term is too long in a fast-changing world. Some also say it will cut down or eliminate awkward periods of ''co-habitation'' like the one France is experiencing now, with a president and prime minister from different parties and often working at cross- purposes.</p>
        <p>Political analysts point out that one reason Mr. Chirac may have reversed course on the measure is because he wants to run again in 2002, when he would turn 70, and his age would be less of an issue with a shorter term.</p>
        <p>But unsure who would get the credit for the vote, neither Mr. Chirac or Mr. Jospin put much effort into campaigning. In recent days, the issue has been somewhat obscured as Mr. Chirac has been forced to respond to charges of corruption with the release of a videotaped confession by a former aide, now deceased.</p>
        <p>Many of those who showed up to vote today said they felt used by politicians, who were asking them about something that seemed irrelevant.</p>
        <p>Eric Sternhac, an editor who lives in Paris, said he returned a blank envelope. ''There are so many questions that are more important to us -- taxes, the state of education, how much we spend on the justice ministry,'' he said. ''Why are they asking us to vote on this?''</p>
