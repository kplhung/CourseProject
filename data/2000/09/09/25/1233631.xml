        <p>Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie and Yolanda Griffith combined for 46 points and 25 rebounds tonight as the United States finished unbeaten in Olympic women's basketball preliminary play with a 76-57 victory over Poland.</p>
        <p>Team USA moved to 5-0 in Group B, setting itself up for the easiest draw in the eight-team medal round, which begins at the Super Dome in Olympic Park on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The United States meets Slovakia in a quarterfinal game. In the other game in this bracket, France faces South Korea, with the winner almost certain to meet Team USA in the semifinals.</p>
        <p>Australia increased its chances of meeting the Americans in the gold medal game by holding off France, 69-62, to finish 5-0 in Group A. Sandy Brondello scored 18 points and Lauren Jackson added 17 for the Opals, who will meet Poland in the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>In what will probably be the most competitive quarterfinal match, Brazil will meet Russia, with the winner most likely matching up against Australia in the semifinals.</p>
        <p>By finishing unbeaten, the Americans escaped any possibility of having to face the teams considered their biggest threats -- Australia, Russia and Brazil -- before the gold medal match.</p>
        <p>The United States did not make any friends against Poland.</p>
        <p>Leslie grabbed an offensive rebound early in the second half and cleared space with her elbow. The move sent Poland's Edyta Koryzna sprawling backward to the floor, apparently knocking the wind out of her. Koryzna was carried off the floor and later taken out of the arena in a wheelchair. She was taken to the hospital for X-rays to determine if she had any internal injuries.</p>
        <p>Although television replays seemed to show that the contact was unintentional, Leslie and Team USA were showered with boos throughout much of the second half.</p>
        <p>WEIGHT LIFTING: A THIRD GOLD  Kakhi Kakiasvilis of Greece needed only one attempt in the clean and jerk today to win in the 207-pound (94-kilogram) weight class. In the last two Olympics, Kakiasvilis had been forced to set world records on his final lift to win the gold. Kakiasvilis, who immigrated to Greece after the 1992 Barcelona Games, joins his countryman Pyrros Dimas (at 187 1/4 pounds) and Naim Suleymanoglu of Turkey, known as Pocket Hercules, as three-time gold medalists in weight lifting.</p>
        <p>Kakiasvilis, who was born in Georgia, won his first gold medal in 1992 for the Commonwealth of Independent States. Soon after, he discovered his mother and grandmother were born in Greece and agreed to relocate there. His first name is Akakios, but he is known as Kakhi.</p>
        <p>Kakiasvilis lifted 485 pounds (220 kilograms) on his first and only attempt in the clean and jerk, then watched the rest of the field fail to overtake him. Szymon Kolecki, the 19-year-old world junior champion from Poland, could have taken the lead by five pounds, but was forced to pass up an attempt at 507 pounds (230 kilograms) because of a shoulder injury.</p>
        <p>Kakiasvilis and Kolecki each lifted total weights of 892 3/4 pounds (405 kilograms), but the 31-year-old Kakiasvilis had a lower body weight. Aleksei Petrov of Russia raised 887 1/4 pounds (402.5 kilograms) for the bronze medal. (AP)</p>
        <p>BEACH VOLLEYBALL: U.S. MEN IN FINAL  Dain Blanton served two aces to even the score, then spark a 5-point run that gave him and his teammate Eric Fonoimoana a 15-12 semifinal victory over Portugal's Luis Maia and Joao Brenha. In the gold medal match on Tuesday (Sunday night in Eastern time), the ninth-seeded Americans will face Brazil's third-seeded team of Ze Marco de Melo and Ricardo Santos.</p>
        <p>Ze Marco and Ricardo held on for a 15-13 victory over John Child and Mark Heese of Canada in an 80-minute match, the longest of these Olympics. They then dismantled the German pair of Jorg Ahmann and Axel Hager, 15-5, in the semifinals. (AP)</p>
        <p>FENCING: RUSSIA WINS FINALE  Russia closed out the fencing competition of the Sydney Games by beating France, 45-32, tonight to win the men's team saber.</p>
        <p>The Russians won seven of the nine bouts in the team saber final and had draws in the other two. Germany defeated Romania by 45-27 to take the bronze.</p>
        <p>Russia won four medals in fencing, including gold in men's individual epee and women's team epee. Italy also finished with three golds and five medals over all. (AP)</p>
        <p>MOUNTAIN BIKE: WORLD CHAMPION SCORES  Miguel Martinez of France added an Olympic gold medal to the one he claimed three months ago at the mountain bike world championships.</p>
        <p>Martinez took control late in the sixth lap, passing the silver medalist, Filip Meirhaeghe of Belgium. Then he steadily pulled away from the field, adding a gold medal to the bronze he won in Atlanta in 1996. Martinez was timed in 2 hours 9 minutes 2 seconds, more than a minute ahead of Meirhaeghe. Christoph Sauser of Switzerland got the bronze. (AP)</p>
        <p>SAILING: WINDS SCUTTLE U.S. SKIPPER  The strongest winds yet in the Olympics ended up blowing Jeff Madrigali, the United States Soling skipper, right out of the regatta.</p>
        <p>Madrigali, the 1996 bronze medalist and reigning world champion, won just one of five match races today and was eliminated on a blustery day on Sydney Harbor.</p>
        <p>Denmark, Germany and Russia will move on to face Norway, the Netherlands and New Zealand in the quarterfinals. The medals will be decided next weekend.</p>
        <p>In Mistral, Italy's Alessandra Sensini won the women's gold medal and Austria's Christoph Sieber won the men's gold. Sensini won the 11th and final fleet race by seven seconds over Amelie Lux of Germany. Sensini and Lux tied with 15 points, but Sensini won the gold medal based on five fleet-race victories to three for Lux. Sensini won the bronze medal in 1996. New Zealand's Barbara Kendall won the bronze, completing a set of Olympic medals. She won the gold in 1992 and silver in 1996. (AP)</p>
        <p>TABLE TENNIS: WANG BEATS PARTNER  Wang Nan of China beat her doubles partner, Li Ju, 21-12, 12-21, 19-21, 21-17, 21-18, last night to win the women's singles gold medal. The two got together to beat  their teammates Sun Jin and Yang Ying for the women's doubles gold.</p>
        <p>In the singles, Jing Chen of Taiwan won the bronze medal. Jing won the Olympic singles title for China in 1988 and the silver for Taiwan four years ago. (AP)</p>
