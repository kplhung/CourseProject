        <p>If the New York Philharmonic before the arrival of Kurt Masur as music director in 1991 never seemed a particularly Mendelssohnian orchestra, it was not for lack of a history with the composer.</p>
        <p>For example, the Philharmonic performed Mendelssohn's ''Hebrides'' in 1844, his Violin Concerto in 1849, his ''Italian'' Symphony in 1851 and his ''Ruy Blas'' in 1855, all within a decade or two of their premieres in Europe. And except for ill health, Mendelssohn might have accepted the Philharmonic's invitation to visit New York in 1845, two years before his death.</p>

        <p>If the New York Philharmonic before the arrival of Kurt Masur as music director in 1991 never seemed a particularly Mendelssohnian orchestra, it was not for lack of a history with the composer.</p>
        <p>For example, the Philharmonic performed Mendelssohn's ''Hebrides'' in 1844, his Violin Concerto in 1849, his ''Italian'' Symphony in 1851 and his ''Ruy Blas'' in 1855, all within a decade or two of their premieres in Europe. And except for ill health, Mendelssohn might have accepted the Philharmonic's invitation to visit New York in 1845, two years before his death.</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Masur, one of Mendelssohn's more recent successors as conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, led the Philharmonic in those works on Thursday evening at Avery Fisher Hall to open a three-week Mendelssohn festival, a listener was reminded of the qualities this conductor has brought to the composer's music here.</p>
        <p>From the start of his tenure, Mr. Masur summoned a delicacy and an elegance that had for decades seemed to be no part of the Philharmonic's style. He has since delved into other Mendelssohnian modes: deceptive power, majesty of a modest sort, moody humors, lowering seascapes and ambiguous, shifting atmospheres, spiritual as well as meteorological.</p>
        <p>All those elements come together in the quintessential Mendelssohnian masterpiece, the concert overture ''The Hebrides'' (or ''Fingal's Cave'' in the alternative the Philharmonic prefers), which opened the concert in a gem of a performance. Both here and in another concert overture, ''Ruy Blas,'' starting the second half, many of the best moments played to a Philharmonic strength, the low strings, especially the cellos, which were warm and glowing.</p>
        <p>The Philharmonic's high strings have improved markedly in recent years as well, apparently in no small part because of the arrival of Sheryl Staples, principal associate concertmaster. So it was altogether appropriate that Ms. Staples was given a prominent role in this event, as soloist in Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto.</p>
        <p>This work is a perennial vehicle for teenage prodigies and, as such, is mined more for its opportunities for virtuoso display than for any deeper meanings. Ms. Staples lacked nothing in virtuosity but happily gave the work a more subdued and thoughtful turn, seeming determined to match Mr. Masur in searching out every aspect of the composer's personality in this work. A minor slip near the end scarcely detracted from her lovely, expert reading.</p>
        <p>Mendelssohn's ''Italian'' Symphony was repeated from the orchestra's season-opening concert last Wednesday to fill out the program, which is to be performed again tomorrow evening.</p>
        <p>The second Mendelssohn program, beginning on Wednesday, will center on the incidental music for ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' and the third, next week, will offer ''St. Paul,'' an early oratorio eminently worthy of its famous successor, ''Elijah''; this rare treat, especially, should not be missed.</p>
