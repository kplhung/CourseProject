        <p>Gbadolite, hometown in northern Congo of former Pres Mobutu Sese Seko, is headquarters of Movement for the Liberation of the Congo, and the group's presence there tends to support perception that of the three rebel group trying to oust Pres Laurent Kabila, it is the one most tied to Mobutu regime; Jean-Pierre Bemba, movement's leader, bristles at the association with Mobutuism, which is hard for him to shake; photo; map (M)</p>

        <p>It is mostly jungle here but the runway can  and did, at least twice -- handle the Concorde. This is the hometown of Mobutu Sese Seko, the former dictator who was topped with a leopard-skin hat, and he spared it little.</p>
        <p>There is, for starters, a splendidly tacky Chinese palace. The hydroelectric plant is big enough to power the whole region. It does not and was not meant to. But Gbadolite is certainly well lit, 24 hours a day, even in the middle of a war.</p>

        <p>It is mostly jungle here but the runway can  and did, at least twice -- handle the Concorde. This is the hometown of Mobutu Sese Seko, the former dictator who was topped with a leopard-skin hat, and he spared it little.</p>
        <p>There is, for starters, a splendidly tacky Chinese palace. The hydroelectric plant is big enough to power the whole region. It does not and was not meant to. But Gbadolite is certainly well lit, 24 hours a day, even in the middle of a war.</p>
        <p>This is also the headquarters of the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo -- what one influential African newsletter recently called ''the most successful opposition militia'' fighting to overthrow Congo's current president, Laurent Kabila.</p>
        <p>While the location is convenient, it has done little to dispel the perception that of the three rebel groups fighting Mr. Kabila, this one is most tied to Mr. Mobutu, and by association to the excesses in nearly every corner of Gbadolite.</p>
        <p>The accusation infuriates the rebel leader here, Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former businessman who flourished during the Mobutu era. Mr. Bemba, 38, is a large, enthusiastic, even impressive man whose boyish face struggled to rein itself in when an interview turned to Mr. Mobutu.</p>
        <p>''I don't see the link,'' he insisted at his headquarters here, on Mobutu Sese Seko Avenue. ''I know the people have been really disappointed by Mobutu.''</p>
        <p>''What is a Mobutuist?'' he said a minute later. ''A Mobutuist is a tribalist, a nepotist, a thief. He's corrupt.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bemba said he and the other leaders of his movement are none of those things, though he was quick to suggest that the description fit Mr. Kabila, who toppled Mr. Mobutu in 1997. Mr. Mobutu -- who stole untold billions in government money in 32 years in power -- died shortly afterward in exile.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Bemba and his advisers know that the perception is real and could hurt him if he is able, as he hopes, to transform himself from a rebel in northwest Equateur Province to a top leader of Congo.</p>
        <p>It is hard for him to shake the association. Raised and educated in Belgium, he was the successful owner of aviation and mobile phone companies under Mr. Mobutu's rule. His father, Jeannot Bemba Saolona, was once an economy minister and one of the richest businessmen in what was then called Zaire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bemba's finance secretary served Mr. Mobutu, as did the father of his second in command. Africa Confidential, a newsletter on African politics, reported that Mr. Mobutu's former security adviser, Jean Seti Yale, ''is said, quietly, to be a friend of Bemba's.''</p>
        <p>The newsletter asserted, however, that ''Bemba junior has broken with most of Mobutu's barons,'' including two generals not permitted in the territory he controls. Mr. Bemba made it poignantly clear that he has also broken with his father -- who went on to serve Mr. Kabila, though he was recently fired.</p>
        <p>''I don't belong to a family any more,'' he said. ''I have to justify what I'm doing to the people first. I lost maybe a father but I gained another family -- the people of Congo. And I like them very much.''</p>
        <p>In the nearly two years since he began in Kisangani with 154 men (and the undisguised help of Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, who would also like to see Mr. Kabila fall), Mr. Bemba has sought to develop an economic program distinct from Mr. Mobutu's grab-all philosophy.</p>
        <p>He contends that his rebel movement does not get involved in business itself -- trading the diamonds or coffee in its region -- but imposes taxes, like any modern government.</p>
        <p>If the other two rebel movements are not as tainted with the perception of closeness to Mobutuism, Mr. Bemba has something they largely lack: popularity with the people. This is in part because of his personality, which is forceful, personable and geared more to business than ideology. He mingles with the troops.</p>
        <p>It is in part too because his movement is not associated with Rwanda, which is strongly disliked in Congo and which backs another of the rebel groups, the Congolese Rally for Democracy.</p>
        <p>While no one compares Mr. Bemba to Mr. Mobutu directly, people here in Gbadolite have the habit of comparing Mr. Mobutu's reign favorably with Mr. Kabila's. As Mr. Kabila was winning control, people say, soldiers harassed them and imposed a curfew. Mr. Bemba replaced the soldiers with calm.</p>
        <p>''When Mobutu was here, life was fine and people lived peacefully,'' said Matembe Mabena Embula, 47, who sells onions, rice and garlic at the main market here. ''Mobutu was a dictator but we were all right. And today we're all right too.''</p>
        <p>In fact there is a lingering affection for the original Big Man of Africa in this place where he poured not a little money. A soldier at Mr. Mobutu's now looted private mansion -- enormous, with a two-Jacuzzi bathroom bigger than many Africans' homes -- could not hold the splendor against him.</p>
        <p>''It's good to have a big house like this,'' said the soldier, Jose Etula, 23. ''After all, he was our boss.''</p>
        <p>If there is any dissatisfaction with Mr. Bemba here it is certainly not because of any ties to Mobutu but because many here would like him to fight harder against Mr. Kabila.</p>
        <p>Though there is no fighting in Gbadolite at the moment, people are suffering with little money and few jobs. A university student, for example, Amani Itebo, 23, recently visited his family outside the city. They could not give him money for books and supplies but handed over a baby chimpanzee, which hung sick and weak the other morning around Mr. Ibelo's neck. He was trying to sell the chimp for $25 to keep his studies going.</p>
        <p>''I want the M.L.C. fighting quickly and taking more territory,'' he said, ''because life is very difficult.''</p>
