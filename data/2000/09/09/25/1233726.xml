        <p>Since the beginning of the season, Brad Johnson has avoided reading the newspapers or watching much television, trading ignorance on matters like the presidential race for the bliss of ignoring the critiques that have accompanied his every misfire.</p>
        <p>But Johnson has been well aware of the pressure mounting as the highly paid and highly regarded Washington Redskins struggled to a 1-2 start. On the practice field, Johnson spent the past week preparing for the Giants. Off the field, the Redskins quarterback spent his time deflecting rumors and speculation about his status.</p>
        <p>Johnson persevered, certain that the great success that came to him a year ago was just a big catch or a lucky break away. And his coach, Norv Turner, stuck by him as well, while his job was rumored to be just as tenuous. And if it felt as if Johnson's world was collapsing around him, it seemed like it on the field tonight, too, the first time he dropped back to pass and found Keith Hamilton charging into the Redskins backfield and grabbing him for a sack.</p>
        <p>But just as he dodged the troubles off the field, he suddenly found a way around them on the field. The Giants never laid a hand on Johnson again, at least until he was able to unload the ball downfield.</p>
        <p>The passes that slipped off fingertips in the first three weeks suddenly found their targets, and by halftime, there was little need to glance to the sideline to see if his backup, Jeff George, was warming up. Johnson was nearly flawless, completing  14 of 20 passes for 289 yards and 2 touchdowns in leading the Redskins to a surprisingly easy 16-6 road victory over the Giants.</p>
        <p>''For the last four weeks, I haven't read anything and I haven't watched anything,'' Johnson said afterward. ''The person I really listen to is Norv. If Norv tells me I'm doing some good things, I listen to him. If he tells me I've got some things to work on, then I work on them.''</p>
        <p>Johnson expressed little concern when he was quizzed about his uncertain status, amid rumors of the hands-on owner Daniel Snyder ready to push for the high-priced backup George to be inserted at the first sign of trouble.</p>
        <p>George spent more time behind center at practice last week, taking more snaps as he prepared for a possible relief role.</p>
        <p>''It kind of comes with the territory,'' Johnson said. ''You win, things go your way. When you lose, it's the quarterback's fault.''</p>
        <p>The 32-year-old Johnson put an end to the speculation by finding his receivers downfield against the Giants, something he had been unable to do in the first three games. Although he had completed 65 percent of his passes this year, his longest completion was 26 yards, to running back Larry Centers. His longest completion to a wide receiver was a 22-yard grab by Irving Fryar.</p>
        <p>But the Redskins found the seams in the Giants' secondary beginning early in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>First, Johnson hit James Thrash on a 46-yard completion down the middle of the field. On the ensuing play, he found Fryar alone in the end zone for a 23-yard score. On his next attempt, he hung in and was hit hard by Jessie Armstead as he released the ball, but still connected with Albert Connell for a 48-yard gain.</p>
        <p>''The biggest difference is, we got some individual matchups, and the receivers got open and came up with huge plays,'' Johnson said.</p>
        <p>A year ago, Johnson had a career-high 90.5 quarterback rating, fifth in the National Football League. He threw 24 touchdowns and just 13 interceptions. But this season, he had five interceptions and just two touchdowns in the first three games.</p>
        <p>But the Giants provided the antidote, just as they had last season when Johnson completed 20 of 28 for three touchdowns in the Redskins' 50-21 rout.</p>
        <p>He was also painfully efficient at times on this night, again finding a hole deep in the secondary as he completed a 53-yard connection to Connell on the opening drive of the third quarter. On the next play, again he found the end zone, this time a 21-yarder to Andre Reed, who easily slipped past Dave Thomas.</p>
        <p>''I said six days ago this wasn't time to panic,'' Johnson said. ''Now we move on. We've got a huge game in Tampa Bay and I'm sure they'll be pointing fingers down there. You know how that thing goes.''</p>
