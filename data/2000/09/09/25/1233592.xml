        <p>Every four years, we wait to see if we are the chosen ones, if we will capture the attention of the public and the press. And every four years, the dreams of some of us are shattered.</p>
        <p>No, I'm not talking about the Olympics but about our own peculiar quadrennial games, the presidential election -- and about the roles that certain states play, or don't play, in the outcome.</p>
        <p>This year, even before the conventioneers rolled up their banners and carted away the empty bottles of Krug from the hospitality suites, the press was characterizing the campaign as a contest for a dozen or so states. The exact rankings depend on which pundit is talking, but the current battlefields appear to be Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington, with a heaping of Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana and Maine thrown in.</p>
        <p>And where are the traditional Big Two -- California, my home state, and New York? Fading fast from the political radar screen.</p>
        <p>With 87 electoral votes -- 32 percent of the haul a candidate needs to ascend to the Oval Office -- we of the East and the West were once heavily courted by presidential campaigners. And in the early stages of this campaign, it looked as if we might be again: George W. Bush was supposed to appeal to California's Hispanic population, a possible wedge against Al Gore. In New York, the race was supposed to be inextricably linked with the resolution of the Hillary Clinton-Rudolph Giuliani slugfest.</p>
        <p>But by early August, the two states were relegated to the ''decided'' column in those ubiquitous color-coded maps that pop up on news shows and in the press. (Also disappearing into below-the-fold-or-in-the-classified-section irrelevancy is Ralph Nader, whose ''Nader factor'' has become a nonfactor, as recent polls have him, along with Pat Buchanan, hovering dangerously around the political equivalent of baseball's Mendoza line -- 3 or 4 percent of the vote, say.)</p>
        <p>Here in California, where we've been moping about the lack of attention, there has been a flurry of articles about how the campaigns have constructed an overpass through the Golden State.</p>
        <p>So in the past two weeks, both presidential candidates have rolled into California for a couple of days. Both had handlers grimly assuring us that the state was ''in play.'' Both held nicely stage-managed rallies by day, followed by evening fundraisers raking millions into their respective parties' coffers. And then they were gone.</p>
        <p>So what are we, the forgotten ones, to do on Election Day? Does it matter? Maybe we should visit the odd relative in Ottawa or, darn it, just be plain too busy meditating at the beach.</p>
        <p>It's not as if we haven't tried. California has worked feverishly to increase its electoral vote totals by populating its deserts and clear-cutting its forests for new subdivisions. And we've pushed our primaries to an earlier date and changed our delegate-selection process from a closed to an open primary -- anything to make us more than tape-delayed spectators on Election Day.</p>
        <p>But for reasons known only to them, Californians (whom we politicians spend millions trying to fathom) have been making up their minds early. So as far as the pundits are concerned, we're boring.</p>
        <p>Yes, the cruelty and the genius of our nation's electoral college system is that even a big state like California or New York can be ignored. Of course, size brings its own rewards in congressional seats, power and pork. But that doesn't mean we aren't envious, watching the caravans, whistle-stops and bus tours rolling through Canton, Harrisburg and Flint.</p>
