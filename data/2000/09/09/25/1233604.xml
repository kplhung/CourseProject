        <p>A veteran of the Second City comedy troupe and more recently, on television, ''The Tracey Ullman Show,'' Dan Castellaneta may be best known as the voice of Homer Simpson, but he's a sketch comedy guy, and a good one.</p>
        <p>In his one-man show ''Where Did Vincent van Gogh?'' at the Chelsea Playhouse, he is making an effort to knit a variety of character sketches together with a narrative, and though that idea is ambitious and reasonable enough, the result is baffling. Many of the sketches themselves -- about a variety of yearning, misguided people -- bristle with dark laughs. The portrait gallery presented here could easily stand together as a satisfying cabaret evening.</p>
        <p>But the story that unites them is so, well, dopey, and so completely irrelevant that its incomprehensibility is barely an issue. The concept is this: The body of an actor playing  van Gogh in a one-man show is overtaken by an alien, a being sent to Earth to gather nine people for some purpose or other that is never quite clear, except that in the end it is supposed to teach us that we -- the characters, the audience, all earthlings -- ''are all part of the ultimate one-man show.''</p>
        <p>Played on a set that is meant to suggest van Gogh's studio, the show begins with Mr. Castellaneta in a crazed portrayal of the artist on the brink of suicide. He fires off a good line or two, and to his credit there's not a single ear reference, but van Gogh has little to do with what follows. Very early on the actor morphs into the alien, who (which?), Mork-like, begins receiving bleeps in his brain that indicate the onset of a character sketch. The first concerns a florist who arranges bouquets that convey literal messages according the symbolic meaning of the individual flowers. From then on the show has a form: character-bleep-alien-bleep-character.</p>
        <p>A small man with the face of an earnest ferret, Mr. Castellaneta has always been persuasive and endearing in the guise of ordinariness, someone who wants something ordinary: a job, a date, understanding. There is something imploring about him; his fundamental character is rooted in a very real grasp of insecurity. This alien, though, is alien to him, and playing its silly contortions, he looks uncomfortable, even a little embarrassed.</p>
        <p>The whole thing is just odd, because when Mr. Castellaneta gets down to what he does best, he can be wickedly engaging, and the show has some fine nuggets. There is, for instance, the little girl showing off paintings ostensibly of her family that end up telling a violent story taken directly from a made-for-television movie.</p>
        <p>There is the ballplayer who begins hallucinating as he stands at the plate, holding a bat; he's seeing everything in slow motion. It's a spectacularly weird conceit, performed with marvelous deadpan, as he conveys the batter's fear, and eventual delight, at his surrealistic predicament.</p>
        <p>And there is a spot-on sendup of a theater producer at a backer's audition performing the numbers from a musical based on the animosity between cats and dogs. ''This will never work out between us,'' he sings as a cat named Mittens to a dog named Buster. ''We are pets of a different genus.''</p>
        <p>These are sketches you would happily watch on television, or in a comedy club, without wanting or needing a collective context. Mr. Castellaneta evidently does. Maybe he's searching for greater meaning in his life; if so, he has still got some thinking to do.</p>
        <p>WHERE DID VINCENT VAN GOGH?  The Life and Death of Vincent van Gogh</p>
        <p>Written and performed by Dan Castellaneta; directed by Brian Feehan; lighting by Chad McArver; set painting by Paul Burke; production stage manager, J. P. Phillips.
