        <p>For months, Richard Nannarello has been girding his three-story Tudor here for a cold and costly winter. He invested in thermal drapes, removed the radiator covers for more warmth, and recently paid a $129 fee to get a long-term contract with an oil company that caps the price of his heating oil at $1.39 a gallon.</p>
        <p>So it came as little relief to Mr. Nannarello when President Clinton  ordered the release of 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Friday to help control heating oil prices. Indeed, more than anything, Mr. Nannarello saw it as a temporary measure to win voters for Vice President Al Gore in the November election.</p>
        <p>''After the election, it may all be forgotten,'' said Mr. Nannarello, 44, a human resources assistant at the United Nations who spent $1,200 last year on heating bills.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Nannarello, many residents in the New York metropolitan area say their worries have not dissipated even though oil from the strategic reserve is expected to keep their heating bills in check, at least for now.</p>
        <p>Energy experts and government officials, including Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, have warned that the price of  heating oil could reach its highest level in years because of growing demand worldwide in a market of limited supplies. On Thursday, Mr. Gore joined them in calling for the release of oil from the strategic reserve.</p>
        <p>The price of crude oil for November delivery fell by $1.32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the president's announcement on Friday, closing at $32.68. Heating oil for delivery in October fell by 4.41 cents a gallon, to 95.48 cents.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview today, Senator Schumer praised the president's decision to release the oil and predicted that it would have a major impact. ''I believe that the price of oil will come down considerably,'' he said. ''My guess is it'll settle at below $30 a barrel.'' He added,  ''This is going to make a huge difference for New York families.''</p>
        <p>For weeks, anxious residents have been taking steps to insulate their homes -- and shield their wallets -- from cold weather and expensive oil. They have run through the stock of weather-stripping and insulation supplies at some hardware stores, rushed to fill their heating tanks before prices rose again, and signed up for contracts that guarantee a steady supply of oil at a fixed cost. Some homeowners are even switching to cheaper heating sources, like wood- and coal-burning stoves.</p>
        <p>''Why wait for Jack Frost to come knocking?'' said Richard Sanders, 65, a retired machinist from Port Chester, N.Y., who installed a wood stove in August and stocked up on five cords of split wood. ''The summer was gone before it started, and now we have a long, cold winter ahead. It'll be a tough one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanders said he would have bought the $1,500 stove even if he had known that the government would increase the supply of heating oil and thereby lower prices a month later. In the last five years, he said, his bills have doubled to $1,200 a year. ''I certainly appreciate what they've done, but I don't know how much it will help,'' he said. ''No matter what you do, it just seems like prices go up every year.''</p>
        <p>Minaj Patel, 43, who owns a dry-cleaning store in Englewood, N.J., said he had planned to raise his  prices next month to offset the growing cost of heating oil, which is used to run his store's presses and machines. Now that may not be necessary. ''It's supposed to help us, right?'' he said of the release from the strategic oil reserve. ''Whatever I can save this winter will be very good, because I'm not a rich man. If I can maintain the same kind of service for my customers without having to pay too much for oil and gas, that would be great.''</p>
        <p>But many residents and business owners have already decided not to take any chances on what could be a long, cold winter. At the Home Depot in New Rochelle, so many customers have requested caulking and weather-stripping that winter inventories were placed on the shelves in August, two months earlier than usual. The most popular items have since been reordered.</p>
        <p>Paul Gencarelli, 28, a construction worker in New Rochelle, emerged from the Home Depot on Thursday afternoon with a 20-foot-long plastic sheet rolled up in his shopping cart. After spending $1,600 for heating oil last winter, he decided to insulate his home by wrapping plastic around the screened-in porch. ''It's getting ridiculous,'' he said. ''It's so expensive that I'm doing everything I can to tighten up the windows and everything else.''</p>
        <p>Other cost-conscious homeowners have been shopping around for the lowest heating oil prices. Since June, for instance, more than 500 people have joined a fuel buyers' program organized by the New York Public Interest Research Group, which negotiates discounts of at least 10 to 30 cents a gallon off retail prices for its 14,000 participants from Albany to New York City and Long Island. ''I think consumers should be concerned, and this should be a wake-up call to the amount of energy we are using,'' said Cathleen Breen, director of the fuel buyers' group.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of customers of the Almeida Oil Company, based in Scarsdale, have signed up for the company's program to cap oil prices between $1.39 and $1.59 per gallon (depending on the contract) until June 30, 2001. In past years, it offered a fixed price of 99.5 cents per gallon. ''This was the first year I've not fixed the price,'' said Robert Almeida, the company's owner, who is also an economist, ''because the market went up so much that I couldn't buy oil at reasonable enough prices for the customers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nannarello, for his part, said the $129 that he spent for the price cap would ease his mind through the winter. Early Thursday, an Almeida Oil worker arrived at his home to top off the 275-gallon heating tank in his basement. It was the first of 25 stops that day for the worker, Jimmy Pyrch. ''Morning, sir,'' Mr. Pyrch said as he unfastened a hose from his truck and fit it around a pipe on the side of the house. ''What do you think, we going to have a cold winter?''</p>
        <p>As his customer nodded, Mr. Pyrch twisted a valve to release the flow of heating oil. ''I hope so,'' he said with a broad smile. ''For the boss's sake anyway.''</p>
