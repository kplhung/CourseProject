        <p>Taking their cue from the president's surprise attack on his own attorney general and energy secretary, apologists for Clinton's China policy are trying to turn the lawbreaking scientist Wen Ho Lee into a hero.</p>
        <p>The new line bemoans ''the railroading of a basically innocent man because of his race.'' It suggests that his motive in downloading 400,000 pages of data from the Los Alamos lab, transferring it to his insecure computer and then supposedly destroying copies he made was ''that he was looking for a job and wanted to enhance his resume.''</p>
        <p>The idea is to introduce a new anti-McCarthyism. In a Parthian shot, the departing president is wrapping himself in a spurious mantle of civil liberty.</p>
        <p>Making a martyr out of Lee required making a villain out of Notra Trulock, the whistleblower who called attention to the abysmal security at our secret labs. Step two was to portray as dupes, racists and hysterics the members of Congress and journalists who forced a careless administration to get serious about security.</p>
        <p>But the revisionist campaign is more ambitious. It wants to use sympathy for Lee, who was harshly treated in jail while awaiting trial, to discredit all evidence of the interrelated Clinton ''Asian connections.''</p>
        <p>What about the millions in funds raised by and through the Riady family of Indonesia, undiscovered by an inept Justice department investigation despite F.B.I. protests? Forget it, along with Clinton's flip-flop of China policy -- from ''butchers of Beijing'' to ''strategic partners'' -- that followed all the influence-purchasing.</p>
        <p>The lobbying and fund-raising of Johnny Chung, 50 times waved into the White House through Hillary Clinton's office, often with arms-dealing Chinese officials in tow? Forget that, too, along with the revelations of Senate committees about new permissiveness on arms sales by big Democratic contributors.</p>
        <p>Political canonizers also cast aspersions on last year's bipartisan Cox report, which found serious penetrations of America's most closely held atomic secrets. We learned that over a decade ago China stole the secret of our most advanced W-88 thermonuclear warhead; that breach of security is on a par with the theft of atomic secrets for which Vladimir Putin recently thanked ''Western scientists.''</p>
        <p>Curiously, in his report on Chinese espionage, Chairman Chris Cox warned against the demonization of individual suspects. Reno Justice had long before refused an F.B.I. request to wiretap Wen Ho Lee (one of the few refusals of that year's 700 requests), but with the heat on, Clinton's new energy secretary, Bill Richardson, fired Lee. Only then was the scientist's house searched and much of his cache of top-secret ''legacy codes'' found.</p>
        <p>Clinton's college classmate and crony was the local U.S. attorney and threw the book at Lee. The scientist became the scapegoat for the administration's laxity because Clinton needed to show he was tough on China's espionage.</p>
        <p>A year later the case against Lee ended in a plea bargain: he confessed not to spying, but to mishandling secrets. The judge, though finding that Lee had committed ''a serious crime,'' excoriated the prosecution and released the criminal. Clinton, never to be out-apologized, reversed field, claimed to have been ''troubled'' all along, and in effect dumped scorn on the ultra-loyal Reno and the expendable Richardson.</p>
        <p>Why did the government let Lee cop a plea? In a detailed story in yesterday's Washington Post, reporters Walter Pincus and David Vise laid it out: ''graymail.'' His lawyers threatened to force prosecutors to reveal nuclear secrets in court. (If Jonathan Pollard had graymailed his prosecutors, he'd be a free man today.)</p>
        <p>Is the Chinese agent who stole the W-88 secret, thereby endangering American cities, at large? Yes. Is Lee a spy? We won't know. Is he an innocent? Not by 10 megabytes of copied codes that we cannot be sure are still secret.</p>
        <p>Clinton's crocodile tears for the treatment of this Asian-American are intended to wash away three sins: allowing China's agents easy White House access, successful influence-by-contribution and repeated exploitation of lax nuclear lab security.</p>
        <p>Anti-McCarthyism suppressed anti-Communism once before. Clinton is giving those grapes of wrath a second squeezing.</p>
