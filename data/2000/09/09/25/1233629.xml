        <p>BP Amoco is in talks to form a joint venture with the oil and gas arm of RWE A.G., the German utility, people close to the discussions said today.</p>
        <p>Separately, RWE is expected to announce on Monday that it has agreed to buy Thames Water for $:4.3 billion, around $6.25 billion, or $:12.15 a share, in cash, these people said. RWE would also assume $:2.4 billion, or $3.5 billion, in debt.</p>
        <p>The negotiations with BP Amoco, the British energy concern, are preliminary and an agreement is not imminent, these people said. They also did not rule out the possibility of an outright sale of the unit.</p>
        <p>A joint venture between RWE's oil and gas arm, called DEA, and BP Amoco would have about 2,600 service stations and a leading position in Germany's market. The venture could be valued at more than $:2 billion, said one person close to both companies' operations.</p>
        <p>Such a deal would bolster BP Amoco's presence in Germany, where it  holds a 7 percent market share. The company, already a leading oil and gas supplier in Britain, has said it is looking to expand its refinery and service station operations in Europe.</p>
        <p>For RWE, shedding DEA, which it acquired from Texaco in 1988, either through a joint venture or an outright sale would allow the company to gain economies of scale that would help mitigate rising oil prices.</p>
        <p>DEA produces about 4 million tons of oil a year, but its refineries -- of which it owns two and has stakes in two others -- sell 19 million tons to service stations. That gap leaves DEA vulnerable to price fluctuations on the 15 million tons it must buy in the open market.</p>
        <p>''If you have high oil prices, the big multinationals can use economies of scale to ride this out,'' one person close to the talks said. ''For RWE, this deal would make sense.''</p>
        <p>RWE has also discussed possible options with Royal Dutch/Shell, but those talks were unsuccessful, the person said.</p>
        <p>An outright sale as opposed to a joint venture of DEA would be more in line with RWE's strategy of divesting noncore businesses in order to better focus on expanding its presence in the European utility market.</p>
        <p>RWE currently operates electric, water and waste-management services in about 120 countries, but its purchase of Thames Water would be its first foray in Britain.</p>
