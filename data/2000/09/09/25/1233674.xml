        <p>President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who moved into their Dutch colonial in Chappaqua, N.Y., in January, have not been shopping for an apartment in Manhattan, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mrs. Clinton said it was not inconceivable that the couple might decide to look for a Manhattan apartment at some point. But Howard Wolfson, the communications director for Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign, said there was no truth to a report in The New York Post yesterday that the Clintons had enlisted colleagues to look at condominiums in two luxury buildings, one on Central Park West and one on Park Avenue. An apartment would complement their Chappaqua home, the report said.</p>
        <p>''None of it is true,'' Mr. Wolfson said.</p>
        <p>Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for The New York Post, said the newspaper stood by its article.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, who has criticized Mrs. Clinton for her relatively recent arrival in New York, could not resist a dig when asked about the report.</p>
        <p>''I knew they were going to put their house up for sale in Chappaqua after the election,'' he said, ''but I didn't think it would be this quick.''</p>
