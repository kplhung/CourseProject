        <p>If there is one thing Hillary Rodham Clinton has always been adamant about in her years in public life, it is that it takes money -- lots of it -- to win a campaign. The aggressive interpretation of the nation's campaign finance laws has been a hallmark of the Clinton years in Washington; one of her closest advisers, Harold P. Ickes, a lawyer, is renowned in national political circles for his mastery of the use of so-called soft money.</p>
        <p>So it was that, her public posturing notwithstanding, Mrs. Clinton did not come easily to the tentative deal she and Rick A. Lazio struck on Saturday night to eliminate the use of the largely unregulated kind of campaign funds known as soft money in the Senate race. Mr. Lazio had left her no choice but to agree to it, and she supported it only after a delay that distressed some Democrats who thought that she was reminding voters what it was that many of them found unsettling about this first family. In the process, she handed Mr. Lazio a soapbox that he has gladly mounted, particularly after his own difficult days following their debate in Buffalo two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>On the upside, as Mrs. Clinton's advisers hastened to argue yesterday, the first lady may be able to put behind her an issue that has never played to her benefit. Although it is questionable whether the nation's porous campaign finance laws matter much to people outside Washington -- and Mr. Lazio certainly is not clean on this issue, having raised much soft money during his own career -- his advisers assert that the issue serves as a hammer to drive at Mrs. Clinton's character and credibility.</p>
        <p>''They've now lost that,'' one of Mrs. Clinton's senior advisers said yesterday. ''They challenged her on trust, and she met the challenge. The main thing is that this takes the thing off the table.''</p>
        <p>Still, it would seem that Mrs. Clinton has suffered some self-inflicted and perhaps unnecessary damage in trying to clear this particular table. Her aides did not seem to notice when the subject shifted from Mr. Lazio's manners in aggressively demanding at their debate that she sign a soft-money ban, which clearly helped the first lady, to the merits of the ban itself, which seems to have benefited Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Her campaign's protracted negotiating strategy raised questions, even among supporters, about whether she really wanted a deal. By Friday, Mrs. Clinton was confronting questions about fund-raising on two fronts that, synergetically, reinforced any concerns voters had about her political ethics: The accounts of her resisting a deal on soft money and the disclosures that the Clintons had reopened the infamous doors of the Lincoln bedroom by inviting contributors to Mrs. Clinton's campaign to stay at Camp David and the White House.</p>
        <p>By then, Mrs. Clinton was coming under attack by editorial boards, a particularly untimely development because this is the time of year when those boards are considering their endorsements. And it was a situation that one of Mrs. Clinton's associates said could likely have been avoided had she compromised on Thursday instead of waiting until Saturday night to agree to a deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton hastened to claim credit for the agreement this weekend, proclaiming it a watershed in American politics. But it was Mr. Lazio who viewed the agreement as a much-needed tonic for his campaign, showing up on national television yesterday morning to boast of it. Mrs. Clinton had no public appearances scheduled yesterday.</p>
        <p>This is a fast-moving campaign, and neither side was claiming yesterday that the events of the past few days would necessarily reshape the contours of the contest. Still, one Democrat said yesterday that Mrs. Clinton lost an opportunity here by not seizing the offensive on an issue that Mr. Lazio has viewed as one of her greater vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>The hesitancy displayed by Mrs. Clinton's campaign is a reflection both of her very strong feelings about the need of money to run a campaign -- be it one of her husband's campaigns for governor or her own campaign to persuade Congress to adopt a national health care plan -- and the debate among her advisers about the potency of campaign finance laws as an issue.</p>
        <p>Some of Mrs. Clinton's associates argued that it was in her interest to take on this issue, and that the political advantage to be gained would more than outweigh the loss in funds Mrs. Clinton suffered by giving up the use of soft money. But Mrs. Clinton and some of her advisers were said to have resisted this, noting with worry the success that Mr. Lazio has had in fund-raising since he entered the race.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has a clear advantage in raising soft money, the largely unregulated contributions that go to political parties and committees. The funds are to be used for party-building, but politicians, following the trail blazed by President Clinton, have found legitimate ways to use it to promote their candidacies.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lazio has the advantage in so-called hard dollars, the limited contributions made to the official campaign committees that, under the tentative deal, are supposed to be the only source for financing advertisements in the campaign. As of Aug. 23, the last reporting date, Mr. Lazio had $10.2 million in hard dollars on hand, compared with Mrs. Clinton's $7.1 million, and the first lady's advisers said they believed the disparity would increase in the weeks ahead.</p>
        <p>The problem for Mrs. Clinton is that because there are limits on hard-dollar contributions, she cannot go back to supporters who have reached their limit and ask them to give again.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, argued that it was Mrs. Clinton who had first proposed the soft-money ban, last December, while campaigning in Syracuse. She reiterated her proposal when Mr. Lazio stepped into the race.</p>
        <p>But a review of the way Mrs. Clinton and her advisers has handled this issue suggests she was never eager to reach a deal. When she first made her proposal for a soft-money ban, she made it contingent on her opponent Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani winning agreements from all outside groups that they stay out of New York, a condition that even Democrats suggested was prohibitive.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Lazio raised the idea of a ban again, she responded by escalating her original demand, saying that Mr. Lazio had to obtain signed agreements from the independent committees. Her campaign seemed more than a little bit surprised when Mr. Lazio actually complied.</p>
        <p>After a flurry of e-mail and news conferences, Mrs. Clinton then put forth, on Friday, a revised call for a soft-money ban. But this time, it was laced with what Mr. Lazio's advisers saw as a poison pill: It prohibited spending by independent groups on Mr. Lazio's behalf, but included no such restriction on groups supporting Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Even the first lady's advisers had difficulty arguing the merits of that position. By Saturday, Mrs. Clinton's campaign moved hesitantly to try to figure out how to deal with a fight that Mr. Lazio seemed to be winning, and the first lady announced that she would accept a ban on spending soft money for commercials and would urge independent groups to stop their spending as well, though she said she wanted Mr. Lazio to obtain agreements from political committees supporting him that they would stay out of New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio turned up at his campaign headquarters at 5:30 p.m. to announce, for a second time, that there was a deal. He did not propose any new conditions. Two hours later, Mrs. Clinton's campaign, realizing, it seems, that she had run out of cards, said that an agreement was in fact at hand.</p>
