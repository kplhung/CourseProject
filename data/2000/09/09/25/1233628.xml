        <p>TV Sports column by Richard Sandomir says NBC's tape delays of Olympic events are understandable, given time difference; says issue arises when news happens and it, too, is tape delayed; notes NBC chose to cover one such issue--setting of pommel horse too low--on tape; says NBC decided not to ruin suspense by telling riveting news story live (M)</p>

        <p>It is a predictable outrage that NBC is carrying the Olympics on tape. It is predictable that the complainants forget that NBC ''time-shifted'' about half of the Summer Olympics in Atlanta and all of them in Barcelona and that the tactic was born at ABC long ago.</p>
        <p>I'm not convinced that a mass audience would adore the Seven Network's Olympic production here, where everything is live, where there are no features or profiles, and at 10 o'clock on a Sunday night, as I write this, I can watch the Australia-Kazakhstan men's water polo game from start to finish, with no cuts to any other sport going on around Sydney.</p>

        <p>It is a predictable outrage that NBC is carrying the Olympics on tape. It is predictable that the complainants forget that NBC ''time-shifted'' about half of the Summer Olympics in Atlanta and all of them in Barcelona and that the tactic was born at ABC long ago.</p>
        <p>I'm not convinced that a mass audience would adore the Seven Network's Olympic production here, where everything is live, where there are no features or profiles, and at 10 o'clock on a Sunday night, as I write this, I can watch the Australia-Kazakhstan men's water polo game from start to finish, with no cuts to any other sport going on around Sydney.</p>
        <p>The best thing about Seven is an 11 p.m. show called ''The Dream,'' with two inspired knuckleheads who savage the Games (His Excellency Juan Antonio Samaranch must not be watching) and have caused a mini-craze with their mascot, a crude wombat named Fatso.</p>
        <p>While attending a baseball game (it was live and so was I) Saturday night, I could see Marion Jones and Maurice Greene win their 100-meter sprints on TV monitors in the press area, a half-day or more before they would be seen doing the exact same things on NBC. My confession here is that live is better than tape. It's a no-brainer.</p>
        <p>But Jones won her race at 8:08 p.m. Sydney time, or 5:08 a.m. in New York. No matter the allure of her chase for five gold medals, I wouldn't get up to watch that if I were back in the cozy confines of Forest Hills in Queens.</p>
        <p>Maybe the very few who are devoted to track would -- those same hardy few turn up in dismal numbers for meets televised on Saturday afternoons -- but that does not make a network audience.</p>
        <p>But there is an issue caused by the taped repackaging of the Olympics that requires discussion. What happens when news happens? News is the enemy of a taped Olympics. Yes, Bob Costas is live in the studio, introducing and commenting and interviewing. But all else is on tape. Except when it changes the formula. For example, Costas delivered news about Marie-Jose Perec's hurried departure from Sydney and the Patrick Ewing trade as soon as he could.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, news happened unrelated to a score or a result. On that night, the vaults of one gymnast after another were executed off a horse that was set five centimeters too low. The unforgivable error wrecked the medal chances for the Russian Svetlana Khorkina and the American Elise Ray. By the time they were given the chance for do-overs, they were goners in the competition.</p>
        <p>Yet NBC chose to cover it as it covers everything else: on tape, as if it were live. NBC's Al Trautwig, Elfi Schlegel and Tim Daggett expressed their appropriate outrage, but at least a half-day after the incident occurred. In fact, they covered the situation well once the error was discovered. Daggett, especially, fulminated about the need to offer the gymnasts a chance to vault again.</p>
        <p>Hearing them rail about the impact of the vault's mismeasurement, a genuine news story that rose above the usual goings-on at the Olympic gymnastics site, made me wonder what we would think if CBS, ABC or Fox tape-delayed a football game and didn't show the reversed instant-replay call that dramatically altered the score of the game until 14 hours later.</p>
        <p>Handling this situation differently would have meant NBC had to break out from its standard format. It would have meant, in a sense, ruining the suspense in order to tell a riveting news story.</p>
        <p>It probably would have required Costas to introduce the story and quickly describe how gymnastics officials had set the horse too low. Setting up the tale would not have ruined the tale. If NBC is correct in its philosophy that viewers care more about storytelling than the results, then here was a test of its skills. Give the result upfront -- that the favorite, Khorkina, and Ray had been cheated out of their rightful chance at a medal by the incompetence of the officials.</p>
        <p>And then weave the narrative. But the way NBC ended up telling the story, waiting nearly two hours into prime time, was not the best one. The compelling news was told too late, as if the lead had been buried. Had NBC used its resources more fully, it could have created a better taped narrative. There was only one story that night.</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, said the mismeasured apparatus was not crucial enough to change the evening's narrative style. ''You needed to see it play out, and see how it affected Khorkina and Ray,'' he said. ''Khorkina was destroyed emotionally. We did it in exactly the time it happened in real time.''</p>
        <p>What is newsworthy enough to tear up the format, to offer the news upfront, in a headline of sorts, then tell the story in detail? A positive drug test for a gold-medal winner, he said.</p>
        <p>''That's beyond what happens in a competition,'' he said.</p>
