        <p>In looking ahead to the matchup with the Washington Redskins, Giants defenders recalled the embarrassment of last season's 50-21 rout and used it as motivation.</p>
        <p>The Giants were able to slow the Redskins' running game; Stephen Davis was far from the unstoppable presence of a year ago. But the Giants' secondary was pierced repeatedly, exposing the holes that had been patched up and safely hidden this season.</p>
        <p>Dave Thomas found himself chasing James Thrash on a 46-yard connection in the second quarter, and then was late helping Jason Sehorn on a 48-yarder to Albert Connell. On the next play, Sam Garnes bit on a pump fake that allowed Irving Fryar to easily move past him for a 23-yard touchdown. Thomas again found himself beaten on a 21-yard score in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>The longest pass play of the season for the Redskins in the first three weeks was 26 yards.</p>
        <p>Nothing Doing on Ground</p>
        <p>The Giants' ''Thunder and Lightning'' backfield of Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne showed some flashes, but nothing like their production over the first three games.</p>
        <p>As the Redskins' lead grew larger, the Giants were unable to pound the ball on the ground. In the first half, Barber rushed 9 times for 44 yards, including an 18-yard scamper, while Dayne had just 3 carries for 11 yards. The Giants finished with 93 rushing yards.</p>
        <p>Mitchell Treated for Ulcer</p>
        <p>Pete Mitchell made a mistake last Monday by assuming he was past his physical problems. Mitchell's luck lasted just over 24 hours. At 1 a.m. Wednesday, he woke up with a sharp pain in his abdomen. He could not return to sleep and after consulting with Ronnie Barnes, the Giants' head trainer, he went to a hospital, where doctors found an ulcer in his intestinal lining.</p>
        <p>Considered the only true pass-catching tight end on the Giants' roster, Mitchell missed the first two games of the season with a knee injury he sustained in the first preseason game on Aug. 5. He returned last week against the Bears and was in uniform for tonight's game against Washington.</p>
        <p>''I actually made the mistake of telling my wife that this is the best I've felt in a long time,'' Mitchell said. ''My ankle, my knee were feeling better and I was looking forward to a good rest of the year.''</p>
        <p>Mitchell returned to limited practice Friday. He received antibiotics and doctors told him he couldn't do any damage to the ulcer.</p>
        <p>He has had only three full practices since his knee injury, which required arthroscopic surgery.</p>
