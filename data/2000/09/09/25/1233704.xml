        <p>By and large, health officials are thrilled: West Nile came to the New York region this year, and it has more or less gone, leaving few human victims in its wake. But understanding why that happened has also confused them.</p>
        <p>For instance, the number of birds and other animals that became infected with the virus rose significantly and spread geographically this year compared with 1999. Yet the number of human beings who contracted the virus actually dropped.</p>
        <p>Last year, the hot zone for the virus was in Queens. This year, it was on Staten Island. Far more types of animals have proved vulnerable this season, although not always the ones experts expected.</p>
        <p>The reasons behind how last year and this year diverged are more than brain teasers for epidemiologists. The fact that the West Nile outbreak differed in such puzzling respects underscores how little scientists and public health officials still understand about the virus, and therefore how hard it is to develop health care policies to deal with it.</p>
        <p>What is more, scientists question whether government agencies have an adequate system for diagnosing and exchanging information about West Nile. Such questions will doubtlessly become more urgent as the virus spreads to other states in the coming years, a development health care experts predict.</p>
        <p>''What all this tells us is that we don't know everything we need to know,'' said Dr. Stephen M. Ostroff, the West Nile coordinator at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ''Here we are with only 12 human cases identified, and yet you have to believe that given the intensity of the transmission, the risk was at least as high to humans as last year. I personally believe that our prevention activities have worked. But we don't have a ready explanation.''</p>
        <p>When state and city officials set out this year to deal with the virus, which can cause encephalitis, they had clear advantages over last year, when people were felled by a strange illness, public health workers scurried to figure out how many people were actually infected and the city waged guerrilla warfare on mosquitoes, spraying at high financial and political cost.</p>
        <p>This year, armed with information about the virus, New York entered the season with a clear plan, and experts tip their hats to city and state officials for carefully monitoring mosquitoes, birds and other wildlife, laying down preventive insecticide, telling the public how to avoid bites and spraying pesticides aggressively once the virus returned.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency said the spraying was kept to acceptable levels, although many New Yorkers would disagree, including a coalition of environmental groups that filed a lawsuit over the spraying.</p>
        <p>This undoubtedly had an effect: over all, West Nile killed 7 people around New York in 1999 and severely sickened 55 others; so far this year, only 12 people have even become ill. West Nile season is not completely closed; a first freeze generally signals the true end to the dangerous period. But officials believe that the season is more or less over.</p>
        <p>''The good news is that we feel very clearly is that the surveillance has worked,'' said Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city's health commissioner. ''In terms of policy, the data shows that using the surveillance data to initiate mosquito control is the way to go.''</p>
        <p>Other things about West Nile have also become more clear. For instance, in spite of the widely published theory that children are among the most likely to become very sick from West Nile, the cases prove otherwise. The average age of a New Yorker infected over the last two years was 77, and only a single child was reported with symptoms last year. This is consistent with the outbreak of West Nile in Israel this year, where the average age of the 14 people who have died so far after becoming infected with the virus is 80.</p>
        <p>And for what it is worth, chickens, which were kept in captivity to warn of West Nile by dying off, did not become infected this year; if anything, people became surveillance tools for the chickens.</p>
        <p>Yet many questions remain. While last year's virus spread out only about 30 miles from its center in Queens, this year, more than 2,000 birds and dozens of animals from Canada to Maryland and throughout New England were infected. Hundreds of thousands of mosquitoes were found to be carrying the virus.</p>
        <p>And while last year there were reports of birds and horses stricken with the virus, this year it has hit raccoons, bats, rabbitsand other mammals, surprising even the most seasoned wildlife experts.</p>
        <p>Last year, officials began tracking birds only after human cases were discovered, so more may have been affected than were recorded. But experts said there was no doubt that the virus spread farther and wider this year than last.</p>
        <p>''The impact over the long term on the wildlife population is not an unconsiderable concern,'' Dr. Ostroff said.</p>
        <p>No one knows the path West Nile will take, how often people will get sick (Israel has lived with West Nile for decades, but has outbreaks only every 10 years or so) or how the ecology will eventually be transformed by the virus. But clearly, it is a huge task to manage public health in a national format when regional interests, cultures and resources rub up against one another along the way.</p>
        <p>For one thing, public health systems often do not interpret guidelines set by the C.D.C. in the same way, and often have different goals in dealing with the same illness. This summer, for example, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani lambasted Nassau County and northern New Jersey for not spraying insecticides on his schedule, maintaining that they were endangering the rest of the state. (Officials in those areas said they would spray when they had human cases of their own, thank you.)</p>
        <p>''There is universal agreement that more than ever, it is essential to know the health of the population and the key hazards to it,'' said Thomas A. Burke, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ''But our infrastructure has really not kept pace with that need, and in fact has eroded and gotten worse.''</p>
        <p>Further, many local health departments are nowhere near equipped or staffed adequately to deal with something as strange as a new pathogen in their midst. This is evident in the weekly data collected by the C.D.C. from states on various types of diseases. The numbers often vary wildly, but not because one state, for instance, really has more rabies than others, but rather because it is better at monitoring and reporting.</p>
        <p>''One of the great challenges of health care policy in the United States is that regional public health policies tend to be very significantly regional and surveillance practices tend to be pretty idiosyncratic,'' said Dr. David Low, the director of the Center for Society and Population Health at the University of Texas School of Public Health, who was consulted on the outbreak. ''The basic public health structure here is really not as well supported as it should be. The side effects are significant variations not just in control of diseases, but how various regions keep track of them.''</p>
        <p>Finally, West Nile is studied and managed through a variety of large agencies. The C.D.C. monitors human cases, while the Environmental Protection Agency keeps its fingers on the pesticides portion, and yet another federal agency monitors animal cases. Calls to all three agencies produced three different versions of how many people and animals have been infected; indeed, no one agency aggregates all the current data into one spot.</p>
        <p>The lack of a more sophisticated national system of tracking down diseases has its costs, said W. Ian Lipkin, a scientist at the University of California at Irvine who identified the West Nile virus in New York last year.</p>
        <p>''If we had had a broadly based diagnostic tool last year when this outbreak first emerged, we would have recognized it as West Nile more quickly,'' he said. ''We are not taking a lesson from 1999 in that respect.''</p>
        <p>And Dr. Antonia C. Novello, the New York State health commissioner, warned that while she was happy that there were no deaths yet this year, the state could by no means stop being vigilant about its planning for next year and surveillance in the years to come.</p>
        <p>''It was a good news, bad news situation,'' she said. ''I have no deaths, but every county except for two in my state was affected. And those two counties probably just didn't find dead birds yet.''</p>
