        <p>Moving quickly to settle civil claims that it had cheated auction buyers and sellers for years, the board of Sotheby's last night approved payment of its half of a $512 million settlement, the auction house announced last night. The bulk of the Sotheby's payment will come from its majority shareholder and former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taubman agreed to pay $156 million of the auction house's $256 million portion during an emergency telephone meeting of Sotheby's directors from around the world late yesterday. In exchange, the company settled all potential claims against him.</p>
        <p>''I endorse and am contributing to these settlements to facilitate the resolution of all matters and to minimize the impact on Sotheby's, a company I care about deeply,'' Mr. Taubman said.</p>
        <p>In a separate settlement reached  yesterday, the auction house said it had agreed to pay $30 million to resolve a long-pending lawsuit by shareholders which claimed that the company's dealings with its rival, Christie's, depressed Sotheby's stock and clouded its prospects. This money would also be paid by Mr. Taubman, the company said. In addition, the auction house agreed to issue $40 million in class A stock to plaintiffs in the shareholders' suit.</p>
        <p>Financial analysts said all these measures were intended to assure shareholders that the company's problems were over, making the auction house more attractive for a potential takeover.</p>
        <p>Both auction giants remain targets of a federal criminal antitrust investigation, but Sotheby's said last night that it was ''in serious negotiations with the United States Department of Justice, and is optimistic that a mutually acceptable resolution will be reached in the near future.''</p>
        <p>Christie's, which unlike Sotheby's is privately held, said yesterday that it ''has taken all appropriate measures,'' but would not comment on any settlement.</p>
        <p>The formula by which the money will be divided among plaintiffs has not yet been determined, an official at one of the auction houses said.</p>
        <p>Also, no one would say yesterdayhow much of the settlement would go toward legal fees.</p>
        <p>The $512 million settlement was reached Thursday night by lawyers from Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges, which represents Sotheby's; Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom, representing Christie's; and Boies Schiller &amp; Flexner, the lead counsel representing about 120,000 buyers and sellers who filed suit in March. The suit contended that executives of the two houses had cooperated to fix fees as far back as 1992.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's and Christie's were to vote on the agreement by next Saturday, but after word of the agreement leaked out, Sotheby's called yesterday's meeting.</p>
        <p>In a statement yesterday, Christie's said the company ''has no comment at this time of the reports that have appeared in the press regarding the civil antitrust class actions.''</p>
        <p>Of the $100 million obligation that would remain after Mr. Taubman's contribution, Sotheby's, like Christie's, would be allowed to pay $50 million in the form of certificates to sellers. These certificates would be transferrable, and could be used to reduce commission costs of future consignments.</p>
        <p>As a result, Sotheby's would only need to come up with an additional $50 million to satisfy its part of the settlement agreement.</p>
        <p>The former chief executive of Sotheby's, Diana D. Brooks, who along with Mr. Taubman resigned under fire in February, will not contribute to the settlement at this point, lawyers familiar with the agreement said. But they added that the company, in fulfilling its responsibility to shareholders, may yet take financial action against her.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the agreement, in addition to the $256 million that each house must pay, the two houses must split the costs of notifying buyers and sellers. They must also split administrative expenses for processing and distributing claims, which could cost another $1 million.</p>
        <p>Figures in the art world reacted with amazement to the size of the settlement. Herbert Black, a collector and copper trader from Montreal who was the first to sue the auction houses, said, ''Initially I thought it would be half of what it is, based on what my lawyers led me to believe.'' Asked how much money he expected to get, he would only say, ''A lot.''</p>
        <p>As for the certificates, Mr. Black said, ''This buys peace between Sotheby's, Christie's and its clients. Yes, I will definitely use them if I have something to sell in the future.''</p>
        <p>Art and antiques dealers -- who make up a large proportion of the company's buyers and sellers -- said they, too, were staggered by the settlement.</p>
        <p>''The amount reached is huge, perhaps significantly more than anyone anticipated,'' said Abigail Asher, a Manhattan dealer. ''It will go a long way to ensuring a fair and competitive art market, which benefits everyone.''</p>
        <p>''I was shocked at the amount of money,'' said Stephen Mazoh, an art dealer based in Rhinebeck, N.Y. ''Now, I wonder how the whole thing will unravel next. Since Christie's is a privately held company, its owner, Francois Pinhault, can wash the losses against his other businesses. But for Sotheby's, it's a different matter.''</p>
        <p>Sotheby's has been preparing for a big payment for months. In February, the company announced that it had arranged with an international banking syndicate for up to $300 million in financing.</p>
        <p>The class-action suit was filed in March by buyers and sellers who charged that the two auction houses had deprived customers of the ability to win better terms. They also charged that the companies swapped lists of their richest customers, who would be spared any sellers' fees at all.</p>
        <p>The suit grew out of a three-year- old investigation by the Justice Department's antitrust division in New York. That investigation appears to be nearing a conclusion, one that might be hastened by the civil settlement. For weeks, prosecutors have been seeking to turn Ms. Brooks into a witness against Mr. Taubman in return for leniency, but no terms have been reached.</p>
