        <p>Gordon broods over Tony becoming leader. Tony wishes Gordon would get a life. Mo has gotten too popular, and Peter, unpopular and banished, returns to stab her in the back. Tony takes Peter back in and shuns Mo. Mo says she's leaving the group.</p>
        <p>The latest rumors from the ''Survival'' island or the ''Big Brother'' house? No, merely the latest reports about the men and women cohabiting the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.</p>
        <p>Once ruthlessly disciplined to stay on message, the members of Tony Blair's administration -- chief among them the chancellor, Gordon Brown, the former Northern Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam, and her successor, Peter Mandelson -- have been falling into personal feuds. The spats and snits are all being published just as the Labor government has fallen dramatically in public estimation and meets in Brighton this week to prepare for elections expected next May.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair today called on his restive party to ''stand firm'' and ''hold its nerve'' and not be diverted by the ''froth'' of internal cabinet disputes. What is important for Labor this week is starting to recover the unity and momentum that carried it to a landslide victory in 1997 and kept it 20 points ahead of the floundering Conservative opposition for more than three years.</p>
        <p>But any hopes Labor had of staging an American-style celebratory convention to send happy activists out on the campaign trail are threatened by its current loss of public following and by rabble-rousing struggles.</p>
        <p>There will be fights over pensioners' demands for more than the modest $1.10 rise in weekly benefits they got last year and motorists' outrage at high fuel taxes that have taken the price of a gallon of gasoline to more than $4.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair faces the challenge no longer as the high-riding commander of a party lined up behind him in smart formations. It was his poorly presented refusal to give in to nationwide fuel protests earlier this month that sent his ratings into a free fall, and surveys now show Labor from four to eight points behind the Conservatives.</p>
        <p>Cushioned from dissent by his huge parliamentary majority, Mr. Blair was caught unawares in the fuel crisis, and the voters now say his actions showed him to be arrogant, incompetent and out of touch with public sentiment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair said today that while he took seriously the public dismay at the internal bickering and the need to listen more to what is happening far from 10 Downing Street, he observed, ''In a funny way, although I think our popularity may have been dented in the last few weeks, our credibility has been enhanced.''</p>
        <p>The newly published feuds record Mr. Brown's recurring resentment over Mr. Blair's decision in 1994 to contest the party leadership and Mr. Blair's past comments to friends that his intense and moody Treasury head should get married and settle down. Mr. Brown, a 49-year-old bachelor, finally wed his longtime girlfriend, Sarah Macaulay, in July.</p>
        <p>The other disputes center on Mr. Blair's removal of Ms. Mowlam, the most popular member of his cabinet, as Northern Ireland secretary last year, giving the job to his closest political strategist, Mr. Mandelson, who had earlier resigned from the cabinet in disgrace. Ms. Mowlam announced this month that she would be leaving her marginal cabinet post and quitting Parliament at the next election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair's central political ambition remains to transform public services, available to all, with a stable economy and sound public finances. But announcing initiatives has proved easier than producing results.</p>
        <p>That shortfall has been aggravated by Labor's tendency to repackage the same amounts of money and to extend pledges that cannot be readily fulfilled. At a past convention, Mr. Blair promised that 1999 would be the ''year of delivery.'' More recently he assured Britons that the fuel supply blocked by protesters would start to return to normal in 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Two festering scandals have reignited during the troubled recent weeks to keep the cabinet divisions on the front pages.</p>
        <p>The continuing poor performance of the Millennium Dome, the government's pet attraction, and evidence that its finances are in a chaotic state have prompted repeated calls for the resignation of its overseer, Lord Falconer, one of Mr. Blair's oldest friends and closest political advisers. While government ministers reluctantly fell in behind the defense of the project, Clare Short, the outspoken international development secretary, this week called it a ''disaster'' and a ''flop.''</p>
        <p>And new reports suggested that Mr. Brown had lied to the BBC about the government's most damaging brush with corruption -- the linking in 1997 of a secret $1.6 million donation to the Labor Party from Formula One racing's chief, Bernie Ecclestone, with a decision by Mr. Blair favoring the sport. Denying knowledge of the affair, Mr. Brown did not let the matter rest there. His aides put out word that he suspected the source of the charge was Mr. Blair.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 26, 2000, Tuesday  An article yesterday about feuds among Labor Party members of Britain's government, who were told by Prime Minister Tony Blair to quit bickering so that their party would survive, misstated the title of CBS's summer game show about ruthless competitors on a desert island. It was ''Survivor,'' not ''Survival.''</p>
