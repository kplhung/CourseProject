        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You are right to say (''Sound Strategy on Forest Fires,'' editorial, Sept. 20) that ''local governments will be asked to do the actual work'' of preventing forest fires like those that devastated the West this summer.</p>
        <p>But I am gratified to see the federal government finally give wildfires the attention they deserve. We have long maintained that the damage caused by forest fires is preventable.</p>
        <p>To keep pace with the growing threat of fire, two million to four million acres of Western forest land must be restored each year.</p>
        <p>A plan of this scale requires more than the federal government's good intentions: it requires teamwork across federal-local lines. True teamwork would preclude paternalistic attitudes, which impede federal agencies from working with local authorities.</p>
        <p>People's lives and livelihoods are on the line, and forest fires can be prevented only if we back up the talk with hard work on the local level.</p>
        <p>JANE HAGUE  President, National  Association of Counties  Washington, Sept. 21, 2000</p>
