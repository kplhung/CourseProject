        <p>Marion Jones, trying to win five gold medals in track and field, ran into a major distraction today when her husband, the shot-putter C. J. Hunter, was identified by track and field's international governing body as having tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug.</p>
        <p>Istvan Gyulai, the general secretary of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, track and field's governing body, said today that Hunter had tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone at a competition in Oslo on July 28.</p>
        <p>Gyulai's statement came after Dick Pound, the vice president of the International Olympic Committee, said in an interview today that he had been told by a source he considered reliable that Hunter had tested positive for a banned substance at the Bislett Games in Oslo.</p>
        <p>Prince Alexandre de Merode of Belgium, the head of the I.O.C.'s medical commission, said today that the I.O.C. had confirmed from the Olympic-accredited lab in Oslo that an athlete had tested positive for the steroid nandrolone, in an amount that was 1,000 times as much as the acceptable limit.</p>
        <p>Charley Wells, the agent for Jones and Hunter, said that he knew nothing about any positive test and he denied the allegations in an interview with  Reuters.</p>
        <p>''I know what's going on, and I am aware of the allegations and am going to defend myself vigorously,'' Hunter said in a statement released today.</p>
        <p>Hunter, who is 31, seemed a certainty to win the Olympic gold medal at the Sydney Games earlier this season. However, he suffered a knee injury and underwent arthoscopic surgery, which forced him to withdraw before the Olympics began.</p>
        <p>Nandrolone has been easily detectable for years, and it has puzzled medical officials why a rash of cases involving the steroid has surfaced this year. One possible explanation is that nandrolone may be contained in improperly labeled nutritional supplements that many athletes use, some scientists have said.</p>
        <p>The Sydney Daily Telegraph reported today that Hunter had tested positive for both nandrolone and testosterone, the male sex hormone that can also be used synthetically as a muscle-building steroid.</p>
        <p>Jill Geer, a spokeswoman for the United States track and field federation, declined to comment on the article. She said the federation did not discuss tests for performance-enhancing drugs until an appeals process had been concluded.</p>
        <p>Jones won the 100 meters on Saturday night and is scheduled to compete in the 200 meters, the long jump and the 4x100-meter relay and the 4x400-meter relay. Now she will have to compete with the distraction of knowing that her husband's career has come under a drug cloud.</p>
        <p>Pound's decision to speak publicly appeared to be motivated by the I.O.C.'s long-held suspicion that the Americans have been covering up positive doping tests.</p>
        <p>''I have heard that he tested positive in Norway and that the results were conveyed to the I.A.A.F. and USA Track and Field and that nothing has been done about it,'' Pound said of Hunter.</p>
        <p>Gyulai denied that the test results had been suppressed.</p>
        <p>''There was no cover up,'' Gyulai said. ''The interest of the athlete comes first. There is no procedure or prescription to release such a thing. It must be understood we defend the rights of the individual.''</p>
        <p>Critics of the I.O.C. have contended for years that the Olympic committee was reluctant to catch cheaters for fear of losing credibility with the public and corporate sponsors.</p>
        <p>Dr. Arne Ljundqvist, an I.O.C. member from Sweden, said late Sunday that the I.A.A.F. had been concerned that the American track federation had not reported in a timely manner the results of 12 to 15 suspicious drug tests involving United States track and field athletes dating to the spring of 1999. Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of the American track federation, has called Ljundqvist's assertions ''absurd.''</p>
        <p>Essentially, the debate involves due process and how it is interpreted in various countries. Each drug test involves a urine sample that is split into two parts, known as the A sample and the B sample. The I.A.A.F., based in Monaco, believes that an athlete should be suspended and an announcement made public after an A sample tests positive. The American track federation, however, does not suspend an athlete or announce a positive test until both an A and a B sample have tested positive and the athlete has exhausted a series of appeals that can last for years.</p>
