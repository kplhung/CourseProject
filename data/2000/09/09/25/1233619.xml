        <p>The sinewy man in the navy sweatsuit trudged slowly into the interview area beneath the stands, his legs still sore after a close loss. But Fernandes Herlander Coimbra, his left hand holding a duffel bag on his shoulder, laughed when that name was brought up.</p>
        <p>''I know you were going to ask me about Charles Barkley,'' the 32-year-old forward for the Angolan national basketball team said. ''I just knew.''</p>
        <p>Coimbra is playing in his third straight Olympics, eight years after Barkley maliciously elbowed him in the chest at the 1992 Barcelona Games. If the cheap shot brought him international sympathy and portrayed Barkley as the ugliest of Americans -- a quick Polaroid of the world's richest nation beating up on an impoverished, war-torn African country -- it also gave Coimbra a name.</p>
        <p>''Yes, he made me famous in some places,'' Coimbra said. ''In 1996, when I come to Atlanta, many members of the press are waiting for me at the airport to talk about this. And they ask me, 'If he do it again, what do you do?'</p>
        <p>''My reaction was, 'I don't have the muscles to fight with him.' ''</p>
        <p>Noticing the temperament of the 2000 United States team, Coimbra said he does not believe sportsmanship is improving in America.</p>
        <p>''I watch Alonzo Mourning, and he poses over the player from China, like he wants to fight,'' Coimbra said of a scene from last week's preliminary round. ''The first Dream Team and the second Dream Team, I think, the players were more wholesome and more personality. The new players are young players, and I think they come from -- what can I say? -- not arrogance, but they want to put you in your place in international basketball.''</p>
        <p>Coimbra and the Angolans will not qualify for the medal round. They play their final preliminary game Monday against Russia and will most likely fall to 0-5. They won two games in Barcelona, one in Atlanta. In life and basketball, not much has changed in Angola since 1992. Not much has changed in 25 years, when the fighting began.</p>
        <p>A civil war still hangs depressingly over the African nation. The capital of Luanda is relatively unscathed by the conflict, though every Angolan is affected in some way.</p>
        <p>Mario Palma, the coach of the Angolan team, described how difficult it is to put together an Olympic squad. Only 2 of the 12 players come from the southern part of the country, where the conflict is most intense.</p>
        <p>''If you know the conditions we have over there,'' Palma said of the southern region, ''you cannot believe we make the Olympic Games.''</p>
        <p>After the conflict began, Palma explained, many of the best teachers -- including the ones who taught physical education -- moved to safer areas of the country.</p>
        <p>''They don't teach physical education anymore at schools,'' said Arlindo Macedo de Oliveira, a journalist from Angola covering the Olympics. ''Now we have a problem: some teenagers are good athletes, but sometimes they don't know how to run, how to jump, because they have no physical education.''</p>
        <p>After the war began, he said, many gymnasiums were converted into ammunition depots.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of street basketball,'' Palma said. ''And some of the so-called gyms are really outside, with a roof hanging over. No air-conditioning. You play outside in 95 degrees. And the surface is not like wood surface. It is made up of other fibers. Some players cannot stop on the floor when they go fast.''</p>
        <p>Luanda has one large, well-lighted gymnasium and three smaller gyms. ''Only six teams play, so it's very difficult to get good players and the tallest players,'' Coimbra said. ''Many of the players here just started playing two years ago. It is very hard.''</p>
        <p>In spite of the conditions, Angola still has the best basketball team in Africa. The squad is not very tall, with the 6-foot-7 Coimbra one of the exceptions. To compensate for their lack of height, the Angolans play like the ultimate church-league team, continually lofting 3-pointers and running the break.</p>
        <p>To make up the national team, seven players were taken from one of three professional club teams in Angola and five more were taken from the remaining two teams. A professional player in Angola receives the equivalent of $100 to $200 a month.</p>
        <p>''They give you pocket money when you first start, and if you are good, you can win a car or maybe get an apartment,'' de Oliveira said. ''Sometimes they will give a player a home or a motorcycle, or a well-heeled relative will support the player.''</p>
        <p>Coimbra, who will be 36 in 2004, is unsure if he will compete at his fourth Olympics at the Athens Games. He is a gentle, soft-spoken man, privileged to have had an opportunity to represent his country three times.</p>
        <p>''My dream is someday we can have many players that are more than 2 meters tall, like other countries,'' he said, referring to 6-7 players. ''Also, to play close games against the good teams.''</p>
        <p>He does not play extensive minutes anymore. Often, Coimbra said, he answers more questions about Barkley than about his playing ability.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes when I'm at home, and I watch the N.B.A., I remember that,'' he said. ''I just start laughing.''</p>
        <p>Even in retirement, he added, Barkley remains one of his favorite players. ''I love the way he fights on the court,'' Coimbra said. ''He has a soul.</p>
        <p>''But he's not my favorite anymore.''</p>
        <p>No?</p>
        <p>''No,'' Coimbra said. ''Scottie Pippen. He is now my favorite.''</p>
