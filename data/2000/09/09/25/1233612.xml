        <p>Enter the Don  A stabbing. Seduction. Betrayal. Ghostly vengeance. Don't worry; it's only Mozart's ''Don Giovanni.'' But not just any ''Don Giovanni.'' The Metropolitan Opera, for the first time in its 117-year history, will open its season with a performance of the 1787 work, tonight at 6:30 at Lincoln Center. The title role in this revival of the Franco Zeffirelli production will be sung for the first time at the Met by Bryn Terfel, the Welsh bass-baritone, and the soprano Renee Fleming will sing Donna Anna for the first time at the Met as well. Information: (212)  362-6000.</p>
        <p>Bill of Fare  Here is the menu for something new: actors like Blair Brown, Kate Burton, Maurice Hines, Earl Hyman, Judith Ivey, Rita Moreno, Cliff Robertson, Marlo Thomas and Maria Tucci, not to mention playwrights like Tony Kushner, Peter Stone and John Ford Noonan. The refreshment consists of a series of lunch-hour readings of one-act plays. Under the title ''Food for Thought,'' the readings will take place from 1 to 2 p.m. Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, today through Nov. 7 at the Producers Club, 358 West 44th Street, Manhattan. A $25 ticket buys not only the reading but also a sandwich, pastry and the chance to talk with the actors or playwrights. The opening attraction is Mr. Kushner's ''East Coast Ode to Howard Jarvis,'' a political satire, to be read by Ms. Tucci, Jason Culp and Jared Harris. Information: (212) 362-2560.</p>

        <p>Encore  History repeats itself at Symphony Hall in Boston on Thursday when the Boston Symphony Orchestra, led by Seiji Ozawa, opens its 120th season. When the hall opened on Oct. 15, 1900, Beethoven's ''Missa Solemnis'' was the featured work. On Thursday, with the soprano Emiko Suga, the mezzo-soprano Anna Larsson, the tenor Kurt Streit and the bass Willard White, ''Missa Solemnis'' will be performed again. The symphony's season will feature many noteworthy works heard in the past century in Symphony Hall. Information: (888) 266-1200.</p>
        <p>Omnipresent  Samuel Beckett, thy mysterious spell is everywhere. While the New York Film Festival is showing two films today based on Beckett works, and the Classic Stage Company is preparing for Thursday's previews of Bill Irwin's adaptation his ''Texts for Nothing,'' the Gate Theater of Dublin is starting a monthlong tour of the United States with its productions of ''Krapp's Last Tape'' and ''Waiting for Godot.'' The former makes its debut at 8 tonight at the Performing Arts Center of the University of Texas in Austin. Information: (512) 471-2787.</p>
