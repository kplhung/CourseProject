        <p>Technology advertisers have made decisions on accounts.</p>
        <p>The Unisys Corporation named units of the Grey Global Group in New York to handle its account, with billings estimated at more than $40 million.</p>
        <p>Kerry Baker, director for corporate advertising at Unisys in Blue Bell, Pa., said the decision came after a four-month review that had been narrowed to Grey and two other finalists: Leo Burnett Worldwide in Chicago, part of the B Com3 Group, and McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. The Grey Global units that will work for Unisys are Grey Worldwide, for advertising, and Mediacom, for media services.</p>
        <p>The Unisys account had been handled since 1992 by the Bozell Group in New York, a unit of True North Communications. They parted in May because of a conflict created when a Bozell sibling, FCB Worldwide, became the agency for Compaq Computer.</p>
        <p>And InterNAP Network Services named the San Francisco office of Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic, as its first global agency of record. Billings were estimated at $25 million.</p>
        <p>Bill Hankes, a spokesman for InterNAP in Seattle, said the decision came after a three-month review that was narrowed to Lowe Lintas and two other finalists in San Francisco: Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, part of the Publicis Groupe S.A., and GMO/Hill, Holliday, also part of Lowe.</p>
