        <p>Unlike all the Devils who enjoyed the summer after winning the Stanley Cup, Petr Sykora went through a miserable time. He had trouble with his tonsils before they were removed the day before training camp opened on Sept. 8.</p>
        <p>It was the tonsils, and not a vicious hit by defenseman Darien Hatcher of the Dallas Stars in the last game of the Stanley Cup finals, that gave Sykora, 23, a great deal of pain all summer.</p>
        <p>The hit left him unconscious and sent him to a Dallas hospital, where he watched the Devils' celebration of the National Hockey League championship on television.</p>
        <p>''I don't have to think I'm one or two hits away from getting hurt,'' Sykora said when asked whether the hit by Hatcher had been on his mind. ''I have no fear of getting caught with my head down. I have good vision.</p>
        <p>''I had no headaches and no problems with that,'' he said about the hit. ''My problem was my tonsils.''</p>
        <p>Sykora, a native of the Czech Republic, said he had so much trouble with his tonsils that he was in the hospital two or three times to have them checked.</p>
        <p>''They finally decided there was no other choice but to take them out,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sykora's tonsillitis caused him to lose weight, but he is returning to his playing weight of 192 pounds. He worked off the ice with Mike Vasalani, the Devils' strength coach, for several days before he started skating on his own last Saturday.</p>
        <p>The regular season begins Oct. 6, and that may give Sykora the time he needs to get in game shape for the opener. His chances of playing on opening night are not very good, however. He will definitely not play against the Rangers in a preseason game Monday night and will most likely miss the rest of the preseason, which will end the following Monday night.</p>
        <p>With Sykora doubtful for the start of the season and the restricted free agent Jason Arnott still unsigned, it appears that only one-third of the Devils' top line will be available on opening night, a visit by Montreal during which the second Stanley Cup banner will be raised in Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>Patrik Elias, the team's leader last season in points with 72 and goals with 35, has been skating mostly with Scott Gomez as his center and Alexander Mogilny as his right wing in training camp. The Devils have moved Gomez's stall in the dressing room here at South Mountain Arena next to Sykora's and Elias's.</p>
        <p>''We'll miss him if he is out,'' Sykora said about Arnott, who is unsigned along with Scott Niedermayer. ''He and Scotty are a huge part of this team. Everyone knows how big Jason was last year.''</p>
        <p>Arnott scored the overtime goal that clinched the Stanley Cup and Niedermayer has been the team's most skillful defenseman, but General Manager Lou Lamoriello has stopped negotiations with both.</p>
        <p>There have been no encouraging signs from either side that negotiations will resume soon. As a result, Arnott and Niedermayer may miss the first month of the season or beyond.</p>
        <p>Niedermayer should be used to this. His contract dispute with Lamoriello two years ago was unresolved until after the first month of the season. He played in the International Hockey League then, and it will come as no surprise if both Niedermayer and Arnott choose that route until their contracts are resolved.</p>
