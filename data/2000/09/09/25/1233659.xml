        <p>Vice President Al Gore said today that he did not have any knowledge of a ''mole'' providing his campaign with secrets about his opponent's activities and instead seemed to direct suspicion elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''If somebody in the Bush campaign keeps sending confidential internal data to us,'' Mr. Gore said in response to questions from reporters in a conference call today, ''we'll keep turning it over to the F.B.I.''</p>
        <p>The vice president further made reference to news reports this weekend that quoted unnamed law enforcement officials saying they had identified a suspect in the Bush campaign as a possible source of confidential debate preparation materials that were sent nearly two weeks ago to a supporter of Mr. Gore's.</p>
        <p>But both federal law enforcement officials and aides to Mr. Bush said today that no such suspect had been identified.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Bush's advisers insisted that the Gore campaign's suspension on Saturday of a junior staff member who had boasted about a mole in the Bush campaign raised serious questions about what officials with the Gore campaign might know about the situation.</p>
        <p>''It's becoming increasingly troublesome,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, in his own conference call with reporters. ''It does seem that the more the F.B.I. inquires, the more nervous they're getting in Nashville.''</p>
        <p>''We saw this week that the vice president will say anything to get elected,'' Mr. Fleischer added, referring to several misstatements that the Bush campaign attributed to Mr. Gore. ''There's now a question of whether the vice president's campaign will do anything to get elected.''</p>
        <p>The contest of words reflected the degree to which both the Gore and Bush campaigns are struggling to make sure the matter that began with some errant debate preparation materials does not wind up reflecting ill on their candidates. And it spoke to a mystery that yielded several unusual and ambiguous developments last week.</p>
        <p>The matter began on Sept. 13, when a former Democratic congressman, Thomas Downey, who had been assigned the part of Mr. Bush in the Gore campaign's debate rehearsals, received in the mail a videotape of one of Mr. Bush's debate practice sessions and a stack of related confidential briefing papers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Downey turned the information over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which began what it is still calling a preliminary inquiry to determine whether any federal laws were broken and whether it has jurisdiction for a full investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides said that only the campaign's senior officials had authorized access to -- and copies of -- the materials, and that all those legitimate copies were subsequently accounted for.</p>
        <p>Several Bush advisers said today that many campaign officials believed that the materials were somehow stolen, copied and then replaced by an outsider, and one adviser said that the campaign manager, Joe Allbaugh, had been pressing F.B.I. investigators to pay heed to this possibility.</p>
        <p>One of these advisers noted that the Austin offices of Mark McKinnon, who is the Bush campaign's chief media adviser and had copies of the material, are not as secure as the campaign headquarters and are adjacent to a film editing business used by both Democrats and Republicans.</p>
        <p>Bush advisers said that F.B.I. investigators in Austin had visited Mr. McKinnon's offices and had interviewed some of the people who work there as well as many, but not all, of the senior officials in the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>They said that the F.B.I.'s inquiry was too incomplete for there to be any suspects, that the agency had not informed the Bush campaign of any such conclusions and that Mr. Allbaugh had placed a call on Saturday to Louis J. Freeh, the director of the F.B.I., to complain about a news account to the contrary.</p>
        <p>One Bush aide said this afternoon that Mr. Allbaugh heard back from one of Mr. Freeh's deputies but was still hoping to talk directly to Mr. Freeh.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, on Saturday, officials with the Gore campaign announced that they had reprimanded Michael Doyne, 28, and put him on paid administrative leave while they investigated his actions and statements over the previous days. Mr. Doyne is the administrative assistant to the field director for the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Late last week, Mr. Doyne initially told ABC News, which had heard that he was boasting about a mole in the Bush camp, that he had not made such statements. He even provided ABC News with an affidavit to that effect.</p>
        <p>But when the network later produced an e-mail message, which Mr. Doyne had sent to a longtime friend and which made reference to such a mole, Mr. Doyne amended his account.</p>
        <p>Officials with the Gore campaign said Mr. Doyne's boast was an idle joke and that the campaign, after an internal review, had concluded that it was not receiving or using any confidential information from the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>Federal law enforcement officials said they were proceeding cautiously with their inquiry, which they acknowledged was a political hot potato, given the possibility that their suspicions or conclusions might be seen as harmful to one campaign or the other.</p>
