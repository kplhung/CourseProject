        <p>One hour before today's game, Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet stood little more than 10 yards apart, warming up side by side in silence, refusing even to meet each other's gaze. Chrebet wore headphones as he caught passes, the better to insulate himself from the final moments of a week of noise and needling he had taken from Johnson.</p>
        <p>But with 52 seconds left in today's game between the Jets and Tampa Bay, Johnson could only gawk at Chrebet. His sworn nemesis, the flashlight to his star, had just leaped in the back of the end zone to catch a wobbly 18-yard halfback option pass from Curtis Martin that gave the Jets their second touchdown in the final two minutes, completing the Jets' third fourth-quarter comeback in four games and pushing them to a stunning 21-17 upset of the Buccaneers. The Jets are now 4-0 going into their bye week and, with this shocker over a team considered a Super Bowl favorite, they have established themselves -- one-quarter of the way through the season -- as contenders of their own.</p>

        <p>One hour before today's game, Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet stood little more than 10 yards apart, warming up side by side in silence, refusing even to meet each other's gaze. Chrebet wore headphones as he caught passes, the better to insulate himself from the final moments of a week of noise and needling he had taken from Johnson.</p>
        <p>But with 52 seconds left in today's game between the Jets and Tampa Bay, Johnson could only gawk at Chrebet. His sworn nemesis, the flashlight to his star, had just leaped in the back of the end zone to catch a wobbly 18-yard halfback option pass from Curtis Martin that gave the Jets their second touchdown in the final two minutes, completing the Jets' third fourth-quarter comeback in four games and pushing them to a stunning 21-17 upset of the Buccaneers. The Jets are now 4-0 going into their bye week and, with this shocker over a team considered a Super Bowl favorite, they have established themselves -- one-quarter of the way through the season -- as contenders of their own.</p>
        <p>''The power of 46 flashlights can be pretty bright sometimes,'' Coach Al Groh said, referring to the number of players on his gritty team while taking a none-too-subtle dig at Johnson. ''We've been through these before. We say, 'The hotter the fire, the harder the steel.' ''</p>
        <p>Johnson, who caught just one pass for 1 yard, shook his head, and his face was fixed with disgust as the Jets' bench erupted and Chrebet ran off the field. The Jets' defense, which gave the offense the chance for the comeback when Marvin Jones stripped running back Mike Alstott as he rumbled into a pile with 1:48 left and the Bucs leading by 3 points, sealed the victory when the rookie defensive end John Abraham sacked Bucs quarterback Shaun King and caused the fumble that Bryan Cox recovered.</p>
        <p>''That's good,'' Johnson said at the end, ''there's more drama for your papers.''</p>
        <p>Shakespeare would have had trouble providing this much drama in a four-week span. The chance of such an emotional comeback seemed remote with 10 minutes left. Vinny Testaverde, who was enduring a painful return to Tampa, had just thrown his third interception of the day. The second, late in the third quarter, had been returned 37 yards by Ronde Barber for a touchdown that gave Tampa Bay a 17-6 lead. With one of the most fearsome defenses in the league, the lead seemed insurmountable. But, Bucs defensive lineman Warren Sapp said: ''We never put them away. They made plays in the fourth quarter. We always put people away, and we're still searching for the killer instinct.''</p>
        <p>And so, after the Bucs were forced to punt after just three plays, Groh put the backup Ray Lucas into the game. Groh merely wanted to give Testaverde a breather and said he never had any intention of benching him for the rest of the game.</p>
        <p>''Vinny is our guy,'' Groh said. ''When you're in big-time competition, you put the ball in the hands of your big-time players.''</p>
        <p>Testaverde was suffering through another subpar performance, and he finished 22 of 42 for 181 yards. He admitted this week that rust from his yearlong layoff has caused his slow starts and that he was having trouble reading some defenses. Today, Testaverde looked no better. Near the end of the first half, the Jets blew two touchdown opportunities, the first when Testaverde put no zip on a pass to Fred Baxter, who sloppily stepped out of bounds for an incompletion that, had the ball been caught in bounds, would have been an easy touchdown. John Hall's second field goal pulled the Jets to 10-6, and when Victor Green intercepted a King pass, the Jets had the ball on the Bucs' 20-yard line with 42 seconds left in the half. But on second-and-8, Testaverde lofted a pass intended for Martin, never looking anywhere else. Safety Damien Robinson read the play and stepped in front of Martin for the drive-killing interception, Testaverde's first.</p>
        <p>But Testaverde has been extraordinary in the fourth quarter this season. He engineered two scoring drives in the fourth quarter against Green Bay and threw two touchdown passes to Chrebet in the final 6:30 against New England. So after the defense, which held the Bucs to 239 yards, forced another punt, Testaverde came loping back out with 5:01 remaining, with Cox's words ringing in his ears. ''He said, 'Keep with me,' '' Testaverde said. ''If we go down, they're going down with me. I feel the fourth quarter belongs to me. What the team went through a year ago, the mental toughness we gained last year, paid off in the fourth quarter this year.''</p>
        <p>He drove the Jets from their 36. On second-and-goal from the 6, on the first play after the two-minute warning, he sent a screen pass on the left side to Martin, who broke two tackles to scoot into the end zone. The Jets went for a 2-point conversion and, after the rookie receiver Laveranues Coles -- who had earlier caught the first ball of his pro career -- caught a tipped pass in the back of the end zone for the completion, the Jets trailed, 17-14, with 1:54 left.</p>
        <p>The Bucs, not surprisingly, put the ball in the hands of the locomotive of a fullback, the 248-pound Alstott. He ran for 3 yards, and the Jets used a timeout to stop the clock. On second down, Alstott tumbled into a pile. Jones went for the ball and Green came out with it. On came Testaverde again, at the 24-yard line. He handed off to Martin once for 6 yards. The Jets had practiced this play and Martin had, in Chrebet's description, thrown the ball terribly. But the offensive coordinator Dan Henning wanted to run the play and Groh told him to go for it. Martin took the handoff on the right side and Chrebet got behind Robinson. Martin was walloped as he released the ball, but it floated high enough to get over Robinson and into Chrebet's outstretched hands.</p>
        <p>It was, Chrebet said, the biggest catch he has ever made, bigger even than the previous biggies against New England. Johnson had games as good as this as a Jet, but never a catch as good.</p>
        <p>''There is no special meaning to it but that we're 4-0,'' Chrebet said. ''It's not about that. I could say things. I could point fingers. But I'm never ever going to answer questions about that again.''</p>
        <p>Now, he doesn't have to. Johnson will fade from the Jets' consciousness this week and they will be grilled with a much kinder brand of question: Is a return trip to Tampa, in January, for an even more heavily hyped game, in the offing?</p>
        <p>''That's too big a thing to aim at right now,'' Groh said of the Super Bowl, which will be played in Tampa this season. ''We're only at the quarter pole now. A lot of teams that look at too big a target miss it altogether.''</p>
