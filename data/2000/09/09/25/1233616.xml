        <p>In a game that became as raw as the weather, Brazil's defenders kept sliding into Mia Hamm, knocking her feet out from under her but never unmooring her composure or resolve.</p>
        <p>She fell hard on her shoulder, her back, her knees. Three times, the tackles were so rough that Brazil was issued yellow warning cards. Hamm kept getting up, saying nothing.</p>
        <p>In the 60th minute, she was chopped down again, this time from behind by Brazil's Formiga. The referee drew a yellow card and awarded the Americans a free kick from 45 yards. Brandi Chastain lofted the ball toward Lorrie Fair in the penalty area with a pass that looked like a drive from a golf tee. The resulting chaos left Brazil's goalkeeper on the ground and the ball at Hamm's feet on a severe angle to the left of an empty net.</p>
        <p>Suddenly finding herself free, Hamm tucked the ball into the back right corner for a disputed 1-0 American victory over Brazil before 11,200 at Bruce Stadium. In many ways, it was the most important goal of Hamm's spectacular career.</p>
        <p>First, it advanced the United States to the Olympic gold medal game on Thursday in a rematch against the Norwegians, whom the Americans dominated by 2-0 in the first match of this tournament. Norway defeated Germany, 1-0, on an own goal in tonight's other semifinal.</p>
        <p>Second, Hamm is a great player, but also a conflicted one. She acknowledges that her confidence sags as her scoring ebbs. Since last year's Women's World Cup, she has faced increased scrutiny about whether her game is in decline. It has been her tendency to score early during important tournaments, then to grow quiet as defenses tighten and the pressure of expectation squeezes like a vise.</p>
        <p>Only once before had Hamm delivered a goal after the second game of the Olympics or the World Cup. Tonight, she awakened from that curious dormancy to keep her team alive, and the elation was visible on her face and in the way she raised her arm in celebration.</p>
        <p>Whether she is scoring or not, she works ceaselessly on defense and passing and running. Tonight her acute sense of anticipation left her in the perfect spot to score a goal. She did what a great player does. In one instant she rescued a tense, ugly game during which Brazil often had the upper hand.</p>
        <p>''The team believes in Mia Hamm, Mia Hamm believes in Mia Hamm and the coaching staff believes in Mia Hamm,'' said Coach April Heinrichs, who has grown weary and protective as questions about Hamm have grown more adversarial. She added, ''It goes way beyond goals.''</p>
        <p>Hamm's latest goal, the second of these Games, was the 127th of her career, a record for international play for women or men.</p>
        <p>The goal was as contentious as it was decisive. As Fair headed Chastain's free kick, Brazil's goalkeeper Andreia rushed forward, stuck out her right arm, missed the ball, collided with Tiffeny Milbrett and fell. Circling in front of them, Hamm reached the loose ball and punched it into the net with her left foot.</p>
        <p>Jose Duarte, the Brazilian coach, said that a foul should have been called on Milbrett, who did not disagree.</p>
        <p>''She definitely could have called a foul either way,'' Milbrett said of the Swiss referee, Nicole Petignat, who also gave the Americans a favorable call on Briana Scurry's goalkeeping during the penalty-kick shootout against China in the 1999 World Cup final.</p>
        <p>''I was just trying to wreak havoc,'' Milbrett said. ''I obstructed her, and Mia slotted it in from a tough angle.''</p>
        <p>A total of 51 fouls were called in this vinegary match, and eight yellow cards were issued. The Americans, having traveled ambitiously this year, seemed slow and perhaps tired. They struggled to string passes together and showed none of Brazil's speed or flair. Yet, Brazil has defeated them only once in 17 meetings and has failed to score a goal in eight of the last nine matches.</p>
        <p>The American back line of Chastain, Joy Fawcett, Kate Sobrero and Christie Pearce cleaned up mistakes superbly tonight, and goalkeeper Siri Mullinix made a lunging save of a Roseli blast in the 70th minute. Still, it was left to Hamm to find a way to win. China seemed to distract her with hard fouls earlier in these Olympics. Emotion, she has said repeatedly, is the best and worst aspect of her talent. Instead of growing unnerved tonight, she remained collected as Brazil declined brutishly to give her any space.</p>
        <p>''I take it as a sign of respect,'' Hamm said of the hard fouls. ''If I didn't, I'd probably go crazy.''</p>
        <p>Nigeria tried the same tactic in last summer's World Cup, felling Hamm three times in the early minutes.</p>
        <p>''I'm coming after you,'' she told one of the Nigerian defenders and scored a goal to start a 7-1 rout. Tonight, she said nothing, speaking instead with her feet.</p>
        <p>''You get angry, and a light comes on and you want to go harder,'' Milbrett said of Hamm.</p>
        <p>Afterward, her eyes bloodshot from effort, Hamm faced the toughest moment of her evening, a question about whether her talent had begun to erode. Her answer was as direct as her play had been.</p>
        <p>''All I have to say is that every single day I wake up, I commit myself to being better,'' Hamm said. ''Some days it happens and some days it doesn't. I'm still committed to that. There are going to be games I'm going to dominate and games I'm going to struggle. It doesn't mean I give up.''</p>
