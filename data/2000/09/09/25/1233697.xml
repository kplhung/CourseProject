        <p>The ingrown rhythm-section language of Brad Mehldau's trio has evolved over the last five years to a point of willed indeterminacy. At its best it is a blizzard of shorthand gestures.

        <p>Brad Mehldau Trio  Village Vanguard</p>
        <p>The ingrown rhythm-section language of Brad Mehldau's trio has evolved over the last five years to a point of willed indeterminacy. At its best it is a blizzard of shorthand gestures. Even with Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''It Might As Well Be Spring'' and Cole Porter's ''It's All Right With Me'' -- among the strongest melodies in American music -- there were spots during the band's early set on Tuesday night when it was hard to tell what rhythmic or melodic guide the musicians were following.</p>
        <p>Rhythm, even when it is obscured, is all-important in this band. At the piano Mr. Mehldau articulated his thoughts with care. Sifting through alternate harmonies, he didn't bang or mumble, and he spent a lot of time balancing between beats, making the music float.</p>
        <p>The drummer, Jorge Rossy, has a light touch but a whirlwind energy; a four-beat rhythm turned into a three-beat, and suddenly, among all the small cymbal and drum strokes, there were no clear rhythmic cycles anymore. The listener often ended up following the bassist Larry Grenadier; he played strong, resonating pedal notes that became listening guides both to Mr. Mehldau's shifting harmonies and Mr. Rossy's beats.</p>
        <p>The set included a few new pieces from Mr. Mehldau's new album, ''Places'' (Warner Brothers). One was ''West Hartford,'' written in 32-bar form; another was ''Schloss Elmau,'' with a long, winding theme that sounded as if it came from art-rock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehldau, who is 30, remains tough to figure. One expects a musician at his level of keyboard talent, his self-sufficiency as an artist and his disposition to the kind of rhythmic swoon and free fall demonstrated by Cecil Taylor and Keith Jarrett to offer his music in a outpouring, a discourse that picks up wherever he left off.</p>
        <p>But that's not really who he is.  Instead, his performance on Tuesday was fairly neat. The sense of intuition and play was amazingly contained. The tunes never exploded, and each one ended precisely, narrowing to a little ribbon of dry single notes. This is one of the paradoxes that makes him worth paying attention to.</p>
