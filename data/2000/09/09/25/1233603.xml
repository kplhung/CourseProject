        <p>THESE guys are gods.</p>
        <p>That was my basic reaction when I saw the crews scrambling out of their shells at rowing the other day. They were tall and handsome and in great shape, and they simply glowed with confidence, and not only the medal winners, not just taciturn Steven Redgrave with his five gold medals, but all of them.</p>
        <p>Watching these guys, I had a rather simple epiphany. The Summer Games are on. These guys are Olympians, and so are the people at the table tennis, and the diving, and the sailing.</p>
        <p>This may sound like one of these blatantly obvious ''duhhhh!'' statements, but when the medal-bearers arrive in a procession, it is quite clear that this is not some regional sports festival. For all its flaws, for all the bribes and the drugs and the fatuousness of the leaders, this is, in fact, the Olympics, the best of the best.</p>
        <p>It is happening all around us. I feel sorry for the people back in the States who have to take what the network gives them, more than half a day later, all glossy and packaged and cute. There are television directors screaming in the ear of commentators: ''Tell them about the brother who collects bottle caps! Tell them about the mom who works two jobs!''</p>
        <p>It's better right here, what's available to the naked eye. Pardon if this sounds like blasphemy, but these guys are gods, and the women are goddesses, of assorted body types.</p>
        <p>You can't miss. Right smack in the middle of the Games, now that everybody has mastered the great Olympic crawl through the train lines and the electronic security lines, there are Olympic events all over the huge campus known as Olympic Park.</p>
        <p>To catch the essence of the Olympics, you walk in any direction. I cheated yesterday. I went to the first thing I could find with a Brazilian team in it. The Brazilian fans are the best in the world, good-spirited, well-traveled. They don't just turn on the juice for the soccer team, which is how Brazilians are generally noticed.</p>
        <p>I went looking for goddesses to go with the gods I had seen out at the rowing. There they were, tall and tan, young and lovely, both the Americans and the Brazilians, playing volleyball, the indoor variety. Both teams were undefeated, the Americans being a bit of a surprise. The Americans ranged from 5-foot-9 to 6-2, while the Brazilians ranged from 5-8 to 6-4.</p>
        <p>The roster listed not only the height and weight and birth dates of these players, but also their ''highest reach'' for both spikes and blocks. Janina, for example, with her green-and-yellow braids flopping behind her, reached 312 centimeters, which is 10 feet 2 inches, while Leila had a block of 9-6. For the Americans, Danielle Scott had a spike at 10-8, while Mickisha Hurley had a block of 10-7.</p>
        <p>These altitudes only served to confirm my thesis that there are gods and goddesses in all these arenas and stadiums and pavilions.</p>
        <p>You could hear the shrieks from the players. Every point is a celebration. You could hear the friction as players dived to the wooden floor. I remembered Flo Hyman, the charismatic captain of the 1984 American team, talking ruefully about her ''love-hate relationship with the floor.'' Her coach expected even the spikers to dive, inducing floor burns and bruises and the odd fracture, but good for the soul.</p>
        <p>Volleyball goes on without Hyman. The Brazilian women use only one name, just like the male athletes from their country. There was Fofao and Virna and Janina, while the Americans use their last names: Sykora and Ah Mow and Cross Battle. The Brazilians' shorts were cut high to the hip; the Americans' were somewhat more modest.</p>
        <p>The front-line players jumped high above the net. The shorter players braced two arms to control a ferocious serve. The ball went ''splat'' as it landed out of bounds. The Brazilians shrieked. They won in four sets, and the mystical globes on the Brazilian flag shimmered, and parents passed their children to Brazilian players for a photograph, and Japanese fans with the Brazilian flag painted on their cheeks begged for autographs.</p>
        <p>''Brazilian fans are great,'' said Stacy Sykora, the American stalwart from that well-known volleyball factory, Texas A&amp;M. ''They support their team, but they are friendly to everybody.''</p>
        <p>Sykora said that at times this could be any major volleyball tournament, with the same teams, the same long arms poking at them.</p>
        <p>''But the fans, the spirit, the supporting cast, the hoopla is all different here,'' she said. ''Here there are all kinds of sports.''</p>
        <p>She was right about that. I left the goddesses in shorts and repaired to an internal television set, with access to every event taking place at the Games.</p>
        <p>Click. A burly and dignified discus thrower from Qatar. Click. Hurdlers. Click. South Africa making a neat 6-4-3 double play against South Korea. Click. Tommy Haas of Germany playing Alex Corretja of Spain in tennis. Click. Men's beach volleyball. Click. Windsurfers skittering back into port, their race postponed because of stiff winds. Click. A Cuban discus thrower. Click. A long jumper throwing sprays of sand in the pit.</p>
        <p>These are the Summer Games of a dozen shapes and sizes. Chunky soccer players with low centers of gravity. Lanky basketball players. Outsized weight lifters. Wiry little artistes of table tennis and badminton. They take different forms, but for these 16 days, this is the center of the universe to sporting gods and goddesses, every way you look.</p>
