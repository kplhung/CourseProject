        <p>The chastising of the American ambassador to Israel, Martin S.

        <p>The chastising of the American ambassador to Israel, Martin S. Indyk, whose security clearance has been suspended during an investigation on his handling of classified material, raises questions about how senior diplomats can conduct business while remaining within security regulations, officials said today.</p>
        <p>A hard-charging diplomat who was appointed in 1995 by President Clinton and reappointed last year, Mr. Indyk is said to have used an unclassified laptop computer for writing a classified document and to have taken classified documents home to review them.</p>
        <p>Such behavior has not been uncommon among senior officials, who work arduous hours and often travel long distances on a tight schedule, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Laptop computers are routinely issued to diplomats by the State Department and are used, they said, to compose cables after conversations with foreign leaders or to write talking points for meetings. This material is then transferred to an office computer and marked classified.</p>
        <p>A former senior official who served under Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today that if he had been held to the same standard, he would have been unable to carry out his duties. It appeared, the former official said, that Mr. Indyk was being held up to a standard that many State Department officials could not meet.</p>
        <p>This official noted that investigators had gone out of their way to say that Mr. Indyk's case does not involve espionage or the compromise of any confidential material.</p>
        <p>Samuel W. Lewis, who was ambassador to Israel from 1977 to 1985, said the stringency of security being imposed means that ''either you don't do your job or you are breaking some regulation.''</p>
        <p>''There are scores of us, hundreds of us who have done similar things because there is no other way to do your job,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Morton I. Abramowitz, a former ambassador to Thailand and Turkey, said: ''This is the tip of the iceberg. I guess many others have done the same thing.''</p>
        <p>The question, Mr. Abramowitz said, is, ''How do you enable senior officials to manage sensitive information without keeping them up for 20 hours a day?''</p>
        <p>The State Department's assistant secretary for diplomatic security, David G. Carpenter, briefed two Congressional committees last week on Mr. Indyk.</p>
        <p>His appearance came after the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard C. Shelby, called Dr. Albright and asked her what she was doing about an investigation concerning Mr. Indyk that began during an inspection of the use of department laptops in the summer, State Department officials said.</p>
        <p>That review was ordered after a series of security lapses in the State Department building. Dr. Albright, under pressure from Congress, gave a tough speech saying security was a top concern.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Shelby's telephone call, Dr. Albright decided to go ahead with  Mr. Carpenter's recommendation that Mr. Indyk's security clearance be suspended, pending the outcome of the investigation, officials said.</p>
        <p>A Congressional aide familiar with Mr. Carpenter's briefings said he had told lawmakers that the State Department considered Mr. Indyk to be the best conduit between Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the administration. The Middle East peace negotiations are at a critical stage, and there was a debate in the top echelons of the State Department whether Mr. Indyk could continue talking to Mr. Barak, the aide said.</p>
        <p>But though he is considered important to the talks, the restrictions mean that Mr. Indyk cannot go to his Tel Aviv office or enter the State Department unescorted.</p>
        <p>In his remarks, Mr. Carpenter acknowledged to lawmakers that the handling of classified material was a problem with many ambassadors.</p>
        <p>''There is an issue,'' the Congressional aide said. ''Ambassadors ought to be able to work with classified materials in their residence.''  Diplomats should be given the ability to work at home in a way that does not violate security rules, he added.</p>
        <p>A vast majority of State Department material is classified. When filing reports from abroad, American diplomats routinely mark their cables classified, often in an effort to attract the attention of people back at headquarters.</p>
        <p>In Israel, the treatment of Mr. Indyk, the first Jewish American ambassador there, was greeted with disbelief. One newspaper columnist, Hemi Shalev, spoke of America's ''compulsive zeal for regulations.'' A senior Labor Party politician, Eitan Haber, said that if similar violations were investigated in Israel, ''half the government would be in jail right now.''</p>
        <p>The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham H. Foxman, who is visiting Israel, said he was uneasy that Mr. Indyk's case was the only one to become public. ''Is there only one guy who is possibly guilty of this violation?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, who had asked Mr. Clinton to send Mr. Indyk back as ambassador for a second tour, said the security issue was an ''internal American matter.'' He praised Mr. Indyk for his contributions to the peace effort.</p>
