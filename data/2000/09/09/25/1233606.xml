        <p>Sure, the digital divide is still more like a gaping hole, with nearly half of the population without Internet access.

        <p>According to Nielsen/NetRatings, people earning $21,000 to $33,000, typically in blue-collar, farming or service fields, with a high school education at most, spent the most time online in June -- 11 to 12 hours, compared with the national average of 9 hours.

        <p>Sure, the digital divide is still more like a gaping hole, with nearly half of the population without Internet access. But a surprising new study says that families with lower incomes and less education, once they log on to their home computers, on average spend a lot more time there than do others.</p>
        <p>According to Nielsen/NetRatings, people earning $21,000 to $33,000, typically in blue-collar, farming or service fields, with a high school education at most, spent the most time online in June -- 11 to 12 hours, compared with the national average of 9 hours. Those people who spent the least amount of time online in June were those with an income range of $53,000 to $136,000.</p>
        <p>Peggy O'Neill, group manager and senior analyst at NetRatings, said much of the disparity can be attributed to the fact that blue-collar workers, in factories and service jobs, for example, do not have access to the Internet at work. Higher-income office workers can log on to the Web during the day, reducing the need to go online once they are home.</p>
        <p>The study uses a target marketing system known as Prizm, which classifies United States households into 62 neighborhood clusters, composed of racial and socioeconomic types, and applies a label to each.</p>
        <p>''Yes, there is still a digital divide; minorities are still underrepresented on the Internet,'' Ms. O'Neill said. ''But when lower socioeconomic groups get online, they do find sites relevant to them and spend a disproportionate amount of time there.'' She said this indicated the Web offered a more diverse set of services than people might think.</p>
        <p>The study showed that a lower-income cluster centered in the South spent an average of 12.6 hours online in June. That cluster is characterized as predominantly black, blue-collar laborers with a median income of $20,500. A cluster made up of Hispanic Americans with a median income of $32,600 spent an average of 11.4 hours online.</p>
        <p>The study also showed differences in the kinds of sites people visited from home.</p>
        <p>Those people who spend the most time online frequent entertainment and shopping sites like Walmart.com and Emazing.com, while more affluent users spend more of their online time visiting finance sites like Schwab.com and TheStreet.com.</p>
