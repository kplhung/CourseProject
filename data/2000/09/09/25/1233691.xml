        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Did I miss something in Stanley Herz's Sept. 21 Op-Ed article about the estate tax? He and his wife just inherited some $675,000 tax-free plus nearly two-thirds of some amount above that figure that he, presumably, never expected because his in-laws were never wealthy people. And he is complaining about paying taxes on a portion of it? And if he received this largess tax-free, it would somehow reinforce the ''family values'' of hard work and savings? Why? Because he wouldn't have to work anymore?</p>
