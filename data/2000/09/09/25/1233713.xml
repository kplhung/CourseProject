        <p>Four longtime nurses at St. Vincents Hospital in Manhattan were killed yesterday in a freak accident in Virginia Beach, Va., when their car crashed through the wall of a fifth-floor motel parking deck and tumbled 41 feet to the ground, the police said.</p>
        <p>The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but alcohol and excessive speed have been ruled out, said Don Rimer, a spokesman for the Virginia Beach police.</p>
        <p>The car landed on a walkway that connects the street to the boardwalk, but though it was a sunny afternoon during the city's annual Neptune Festival and there were thousands of pedestrians in the area, no one on the ground was hurt, Mr. Rimer said.</p>
        <p>The women -- Joan Ellen Walsh, 56, and Mary Ann Dono, 60, both of Brooklyn; Mary Ann Going, 60, of Elmhurst, Queens; and Kathleen M. Mollick, 63, of Manhattan -- were staying at the Sandcastle Oceanfront Motel, Mr. Rimer said.</p>
        <p>At 12:30 p.m. yesterday, Ms. Walsh, with the three other women as passengers, drove her 1999 Honda Accord up the ramp to the open-air top deck of the lot adjoining the motel, but did not stop, Mr. Rimer said. The car smashed through a four-foot-high cinder-block wall, did a half-flip in the air and landed on its roof, killing the women instantly, he said.</p>
        <p>The four women were on vacation and had arrived several days ago, Mr. Rimer added.</p>
