        <p>On his deathbed in Venice in 1324, Marco Polo was ordered by a priest to recant, as lies, all his tales of the fabled silk roads from Asia to Europe. ''I haven't described half of what I've seen,'' he retorted.</p>
        <p>Yet even Marco Polo might find the current Lyon Dance Biennial, one of Europe's prime international festivals, stranger than reality. ''The Silk Roads,'' its theme, is inspired by the maritime and overland routes explored by this famous traveler and has transformed the biennial, the ninth since its inception in 1984, into an Asian dance festival. Yet this is hardly your standard overview.</p>
        <p>The other day about 25 good citizens of Lyon moved slowly in a public square in a tai chi workshop under the watchful eye of a master from Taiwan. A Dutch folk troupe with Slovak dancers performed Tibetan dances in the evening. Earlier a male soloist from Hong Kong ran nude around the stage during his concert. In a premiere a French choreographer offered a meditation on an actual case study of three women erotically obsessed with silk.</p>
        <p>Kilina Cremona, another French choreographer (once a teacher at Merce Cunningham's school), has included dancers from Mongolia in a Croatian ballet company she directs in Split, which faces Korcula, an island under Venetian rule when Marco Polo was born there in 1254.</p>
        <p>Paradoxes abound here. Westernized dance companies from Taiwan have focused on their Chinese roots. By contrast the Beijing Modern Dance Company, founded a few years ago, has a postmodern look, and its intense dancers received a stamping ovation.</p>
        <p>To distill the entire festival, 4,000 participants from Lyon, its suburbs and nearby cities took part in the biennial's parade before 200,000 spectators. The mix of hip-hop and Chinese dragon dances said a great deal about this year's eclectic tone.</p>
        <p>As usual, Guy Darmet, the biennial's indefatigable artistic director, has made imaginative use of a geographical springboard, the aspect that distinguishes this festival from all others. The focus is on Asia and the silk trade, but folk material has been deliberately played down. The event is essentially a contemporary dance festival, thankfully free of embarrassing Orientalisms.</p>
        <p>Among the more than 30 groups performing here through Oct. 1, Chinese (including Hong Kong), Taiwanese, South Korean and Japanese modern dance troupes are dominant. But the geographic image associated with the old trade routes by which silk traveled from China to Europe has also allowed Mr. Darmet to make some ingenious connections to Lyon as a silk center. Silk is a slippery fabric, as Mr. Darmet's surprising combinations of dancers and events show.</p>
        <p>On the one hand the biennial is celebrating Lyon as a longtime silk capital (from the 16th century to World War I), still appreciated for the high quality, if not quantity, of its silk and fiber-optics industries. As part of the biennial 300 silk banners from leading manufacturers hang high above the city's main avenues.</p>
        <p>On the other hand one of the best modern dance works seen so far in the three-week festival brought into relief a less commercial aspect of silk's appeal. Delphine Gaud, a 28-year-old newcomer, is one of the few French choreographers from the Rhone region invited to create premieres for the biennial. She has focused on a study by a turn-of-the-century Parisian psychiatrist, Gaetan Gatian de Clerambault.</p>
        <p>At a news conference she said her piece, ''Bombyx Mori'' (the scientific name for the silkworm butterfly), was not influenced by a French film, ''La Crie de la Soie'' (''Silk's Cry''), which deals with the same incident. Instead she worked from the psychiatrist's interviews (1902-6) with three women who stole pieces of silk from stores. Erotically obsessed with the fabric, the women were jailed for theft or put into an asylum.</p>
        <p>Although the real events are not depicted onstage, and a stylized loom is visible for only a few minutes, Ms. Gaud succeeds in conveying a sensual unease among women who cannot relate directly to men. Some in the audience found her piece, with three women and one man, too oblique, but the soundtrack was a wonderfully resonant collage: the steady rhythm of a mechanical silk loom, a stallion's neigh symbolizing virility, the overlay of the voices of women who had worked the looms in Lyon, speaking of their fatigue.</p>
        <p>Most impressive was the choreography. In a duet that seemed Sisyphean, Ms. Gaud and Mychel Lecoq repeatedly collided chest to chest, fitting their bent bodies into each other's contours and yet failing to make emotional contact. La Trisande, Ms. Gaud's company, is a troupe to follow.</p>
        <p>On the more festive side the first ball of this biennial and the festival's third parade in six years have swept much of Lyon into moderate exotica. Those who paid to go to the masked ball, ''Carnival in Venice,'' also paid tribute to Marco Polo's heritage. Dressed in silk capes, masks, turbans and commedia dell'arte costumes, they gyrated to a French pop band singing in English in the basement of the Gallo-Roman Museum. Berangere Salagnon, a student, decided to forgo silk and lace and made her 17th-century dress out of pages from Le Dauphine, a newspaper.</p>
        <p>The festival's parade on Sept. 17 has been the biggest success so far. Unlike the 1998 event, whose Mediterranean theme was attacked by representatives of the National Front, France's extreme-right political party, for its interracial and multicultural aspects, this parade benefited from the sun (it poured last time) and general good cheer.</p>
        <p>Lyon's working-class suburbs, largely populated by North Africans, were again represented, but the city's middle class was also visible among the participants dancing their way down the Avenue de la Republique. Mr. Darmet said in an interview that despite the parade's community outreach, he still saw it as a creative and artistic event that involved amateurs guided by professional choreographers.</p>
        <p>The parade was most beguiling when it was most inventively homemade. A circus group from Taiwan led the way with an authentic dragon dance. But more fun came from the young people moving along a serpentine path, creating a dragon out of blue umbrellas. Drums were made out of plastic water coolers. Stilt dancers encased in huge white balloons represented cocoons, and floats laden with suitcases recalled the many Armenians who came to Lyon to work in the silk industry. Carpets and horsemen evoked Central Asia.</p>
        <p>But Central Asia, a key stretch of the silk route, is largely missing from the biennial. Mr. Darmet said he did not find modern dance companies there that were suitable for the festival's focus on contemporary dance. He did, however, present ''Samarkand, Samarkand,'' a program of traditional music superbly performed by musicians from Uzbekistan, and will present a similar group of Iraqi musicians. Dancers from India, Thailand and South Korea, as well as the Kabuki star Kankuro Nakamura, will pay tribute to tradition, although sometimes with a modern creative touch.</p>
        <p>The core of the festival remains Asian experimental companies unfamiliar to the French but often seen in New York. Taiwan's Cloud Gate Dance Theater, a major company here, will appear next month at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.</p>
        <p>There is more novelty for an American in another Taiwanese group, Han Tang Yuefu, whose artistic director, Chen Mei-O, presents reconstructions of exquisite songs and dances in what is known as the Pear Orchard Theater style (12th-14th centuries). Here is a group that should be seen in the United States, as should the Dutch professional folk troupe Het Internationaal Dansthea ter. Its ''Gold of Xian'' program offered a cheerful panorama of dances from Central Asia, China, Tibet, India and the Caucasus.</p>
        <p>The troupe's approach is decorative rather than deep. But Dutch musicians singing in Uzbek and blond women performing dances from Tajikistan looked as polished as any theatricalized folk group. In any case, Maurits van Geel, the Dutch artistic director who has been researching Central Asian dances since 1991, gave Mr. Darmet just the package tour he needed.</p>
