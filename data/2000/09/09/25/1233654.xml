        <p>Larry Sabato was asked back in January, before the primaries, to make a prediction about the presidential race.</p>
        <p>''I responded with the obvious,'' said Mr. Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. ''I said that on Labor Day, if the Democratic candidate had scheduled a lot of visits to California, the Republican would win the election. But if the Republican was scheduling a lot of visits to Florida, the Democrat would win.''</p>
        <p>It's not exactly Labor Day, but close enough. Florida is in play, big time, and George W. Bush and his closest allies, including his brother Jeb, the governor, have been zipping all over the state, trying to head off a potentially catastrophic upset by Al Gore and Joe Lieberman.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the campaign, most observers were awarding the big states of California and New York to Mr. Gore, and Texas and Florida to Mr. Bush. But now the polls are showing Florida, with its 25 electoral votes, to be a tossup.</p>
        <p>It's easier to imagine the Dodgers moving back to Brooklyn than to come up with a scenario in which Mr. Bush wins the presidency without carrying Florida.</p>
        <p>''If we win Florida,'' crowed Senator Lieberman at a rally in Fort Lauderdale last week, ''there ain't no way we're going to lose this election.''</p>
        <p>So on Friday there was Mr. Bush in Sun City, a senior citizens community on Florida's west coast, offering up a $91 billion plan to find cures for diseases. In keeping with his claim that he is a ''different kind of Republican,'' he likened his proposal to John F. Kennedy's promise to land a man on the moon.</p>
        <p>''I will fund and lead a medical moonshot to reach far beyond what seems possible today and discover new cures for age-old afflictions,'' said Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>In an appearance in Sarasota, the Texas governor scoffed at the idea that he might lose Florida. He said the Democrats ''don't know what's about to hit them in Florida.''</p>
        <p>That may be. But why is Mr. Bush, at least so far, having such a tough time in a state he was supposed to win easily?</p>
        <p>Two reasons. First, the issues. Second, Joe Lieberman.</p>
        <p>''The base was always there to begin with for the Democrats; it just had to be energized,'' said Susan MacManus, a political science professor and expert on Florida voting patterns at the University of South Florida in Tampa. ''Gore and Lieberman have greatly energized Democrats in Florida because of their constant presence in the state, and because they are talking issues that are extremely important to their base, especially senior citizens.''</p>
        <p>Voters in Florida, as elsewhere, have tended to tilt toward the Democrats on such issues as Social Security, Medicare, a prescription drug benefit, protection against abuses by health maintenance organizations, and education.</p>
        <p>By adding Senator Lieberman to the ticket, Mr. Gore not only strengthened his advantage with Jewish voters, particularly in South Florida, he appears also to have gotten a big boost with senior citizens in general.</p>
        <p>In the view of many older voters, he has given the ticket ''a moral compass,'' said Professor MacManus. She added, ''The older woman especially, who might have been tempted to vote for George W. because of his nice family and his parents and the moral direction issue, can now vote for the Democratic ticket for issue reasons because they have been satisfied that it's a ticket with a strong tinge of morality to it.''</p>
        <p>The idea that Governor Bush would win Florida without a fight was never realistic. Democrats actually have a slight edge in voter registration in the state. And while Florida has a Republican governor in Jeb Bush, one of its two U.S. senators is a Democrat, and three of six elected statewide cabinet positions are held by Democrats.</p>
        <p>It is far from a solidly Republican state.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Bill Clinton and Al Gore invested very little in Florida and came within a hair of carrying the state. Four years ago, they campaigned seriously in Florida and won by a healthy margin.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush may yet prevail in Florida, but only with an investment of precious time and campaign money that Republicans would much rather see expended elsewhere.</p>
