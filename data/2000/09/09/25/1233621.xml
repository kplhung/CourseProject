        <p>The dialogue resembles nothing you've heard before in the theater, except perhaps in a Pinter play. It sounds like a conversation overheard on a street corner, bus or public basketball court. And that, says Richard Maxwell, who wrote and directed ''Boxing 2000,'' which opened last week on the Lower East Side, is exactly the point. He wants his characters to sound like real people, not like actors trying to sound like real people.</p>
        <p>''When I ask somebody to read a piece of what I've written, typically the first reaction is to make it into something that is 'real,' '' Mr. Maxwell said. ''My feeling is, it's already real because you're doing it. It's not another reality that you're trying to create. You're seeing what happens in the moment, which is, for me, the highest reality.''</p>

        <p>The dialogue resembles nothing you've heard before in the theater, except perhaps in a Pinter play. It sounds like a conversation overheard on a street corner, bus or public basketball court. And that, says Richard Maxwell, who wrote and directed ''Boxing 2000,'' which opened last week on the Lower East Side, is exactly the point. He wants his characters to sound like real people, not like actors trying to sound like real people.</p>
        <p>''When I ask somebody to read a piece of what I've written, typically the first reaction is to make it into something that is 'real,' '' Mr. Maxwell said. ''My feeling is, it's already real because you're doing it. It's not another reality that you're trying to create. You're seeing what happens in the moment, which is, for me, the highest reality.''</p>
        <p>It is this too-true-to-be-true quality of ''Boxing,'' that Ben Brantley of The New York Times said makes Mr. Maxwell a talent worth marking. Audience members may ''experience the quickened, hopeful heartbeat that comes from watching that rare phenomenon, a genuinely original new talent at work,'' Mr. Brantley wrote in his review. ''It's a sensation that's felt all too rarely these days. Watching Mr. Maxwell's work makes you think of what it must have been like to stumble upon the baffling but seductive creations of the young Sam Shepard in the early 1960's in the East Village.''</p>
        <p>In ''Boxing'' -- which was produced by the New York City Players and runs at the Present Company Theatorium through Saturday -- and in Mr. Maxwell's other works like ''House'' and ''Cowboys and Indians'' characters speak in the flat tones that have become the playwright's signature. But Mr. Maxwell said he does not tell his actors to talk that way, nor does he conceive of his own work as having a certain consistent style. Rather, he said, he simply encourages the people who perform his work to strip away artifice, say the lines and not move too much.</p>
        <p>''There's not a specific quality that I'm going for,'' Mr. Maxwell said. ''For me it's a process of removing the things that are encouraging the person to be a performer as opposed to a person.''</p>
        <p>''If it were a style, I don't think it would have the life that it has under the surface,'' he added. ''Even though they're standing still, these people are always working, they're always looking for moments together.''</p>
        <p>Sure enough, while on the surface the characters in ''Boxing 2000'' seem devoid of emotion, delivering their lines without inflection, one comes away with a sense of knowing them, understanding where they are from and caring about where they end up. Somehow the less demonstrative their behavior, the deeper they seem. There is Jo-Jo and his brother, Freddie, who talk about boxing and what to buy their father for his birthday; Marissa, who together with Freddie does a tentative verbal and physical dance of flirtation; and Freddie's father, who pushes his son to perform in the ring.</p>
        <p>''I'm conscious when I write something that this has the potential to be tender,'' Mr. Maxwell said. ''At the same time if you try to make it tender, it ruins it.''</p>
        <p>The actors who play these roles don't seem to be acting. Many of them don't even know how to act; while a few came to the show with professional experience, the rest have little or none. That is why Mr. Maxwell cast them.</p>
        <p>''The combination of trained and nontrained people creates some interesting and unexpected effects,'' he said. ''A lot of what training does is allow you to cope with the fear of performing, to deal with that extraordinary thing, to go up in front of people and perform these tasks. I think a lot of times training allows you to deny the anxiety, the fear. And I would much prefer to see people afraid and brave.''</p>
        <p>Benjamin Tejeda, who plays Freddie's father and delivers his lines in both English and Spanish, has worked for the last 11 years at the Brooklyn Hebrew School for Special Children. According to his program biography, ''This is his acting debut and he is putting everything he has into this role.'' Lakpa Bhutia, who plays the referee, has appeared in several of Mr. Maxwell's plays (and said in his biography, ''He would like to thank Maxwell for the new bell on his bike'').</p>
        <p>Mr. Maxwell, a lanky 32-year-old with choppy hair and pale skin, is no household name either. Though he has developed a loyal following in downtown theater and his previous work has been well received by critics, he continues to succeed slightly below the radar. He comes from West Fargo, N. D. The youngest of six children, Mr. Maxwell was raised with an appreciation of theater, given that his father, a district judge now retired, was an amateur playwright and active in community theater. (His mother, also retired, was a lawyer for the Environmental Protection Agency.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Maxwell watched his sister, Jan Maxwell -- now an accomplished actor who will be appearing in the Neil Simon play ''The Dinner Party,'' on Broadway this season -- perform in high school plays, appeared in a few himself and went on to study acting at Illinois State University. After college he won a fellowship with the Steppenwolf Theater Company and while in Chicago helped found the Cook County Theater Department, a company that challenged the principles of traditional acting training, like the idea that a scene cannot work without the presence of conflict.</p>
        <p>''We started to just kind of break things down,'' Mr. Maxwell said. ''We were convinced we could come up with our own rules, so we broke them all.''</p>
        <p>He came to New York to seek out the Wooster Group, a theater company whose experimental approach Mr. Maxwell and his colleagues had long admired. He started out sweeping the stage, stayed on for about five months and then one thing started leading to another.</p>
        <p>''I found myself in a community of downtown theater people,'' Mr. Maxwell said. His first play, ''Burlesque,'' was produced by the Ontological Theater. Then ''Clowns Plus Wrestlers'' was staged at the Kitchen. His plays -- many of which have songs that Mr. Maxwell wrote -- have toured Europe. On Oct. 2 he is going to Dublin and then on to Paris with ''House,'' which was produced at Performance Space 122 and won an Obie award last year.</p>
        <p>''Boxing'' was originally commissioned by New York University's experimental theater program in December 1999. Mr. Maxwell said he was interested in writing about boxing because when he was about 10 his father -- who had fought a few times in his youth -- showed him a few moves and told him he had real promise. Mr. Maxwell described the moment: ''He said you have some skills, and I'll train you on one condition, that you give up everything and focus on boxing. There will be compromises and sacrifices, and if you do this, you will be the greatest fighter.''</p>
        <p>''I think I know my dad a little bit better now,'' Mr. Maxwell added. ''He's got a pretty dry sense of humor.'' Mr. Maxwell -- his young head spinning with nightmarish thoughts of brain damage -- said he was ''scared out of my wits'' at the prospect of a boxing career and never mentioned the subject again.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless boxing remained an interest, and Mr. Maxwell said that writing this play prompted him to start training at a gym near his home in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''It was only meant to the dramaturgical,'' Mr. Maxwell said. ''It's a great way to stay in shape.''</p>
        <p>''And,'' he added, ''everybody's doing it.''</p>
