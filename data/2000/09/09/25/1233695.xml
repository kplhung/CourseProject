        <p>Alice Farley Dance Theater  World Financial Center Winter Garden</p>
        <p>Some of the performers were buglike, birdlike or batlike. Others resisted categorization. It was difficult to say what many of the characters were meant to represent and even whether they were supposed to be animal, vegetable or mineral. But it was soon clear that all the strangely garbed figures were intended to symbolize forces of nature in Alice Farley's ''Black Fire: Dreams for the Human Equinox,'' which the Alice Farley Dance Theater presented on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farley, who created both the choreography and the costumes, used extravagant fantasy to depict natural processes in this amiable tribute to the autumn equinox. Dancers moved around the Winter Garden's palm trees, occasionally hugging them. Their comings and goings to recordings of chiming and rattling percussion music from Sarawak, Kalimantan and the Philippines could be interpreted as suggestions of the changing seasons.</p>
        <p>Dancers looking like big beetles scrambled across the floor. Dancers on stilts might have been spindly birds. Other dancers waved frondlike appendages. And there were performers encased in round and brightly colored constructions that resembled animated pumpkins or pieces of ripe fruit.</p>
        <p>The airy and spacious Winter Garden itself contributed to the effectiveness of the piece. By looking out its high windows, spectators could behold pedestrians on the promenade and boats on the Hudson moving while the dancers moved. Two dancers personified the sun at different times of the year. But the real sun outside also moved: it set. Art and nature coexisted harmoniously.</p>
