        <p>After months of petition drives, news conferences and string-pulling by local politicians, New York City Transit officials have decided to abandon a proposed rerouting of the No. 5 train in the Bronx from express to local tracks for several stops.</p>
        <p>Opponents contended that the change would have delayed thousands of riders and caused crowding problems that would have reverberated well into Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The rerouting would have affected a relatively small stretch of the No. 5 line. But the proposal, which was announced last spring, has generated intense criticism from the Bronx to Manhattan. The fight illustrated not only the close interrelation of everything in the subway system, but also the kind of determined opposition that public transportation changes can inspire.</p>
        <p>Transit officials said they wanted to make the change because the Dyre Avenue branch of the No. 5 train must cross a set of other tracks so that it can run express between 180th Street and 149th Street. The crisscrossing, according to one transit memorandum, has long made trains on the lines ''difficult to schedule and even more difficult to operate in a reliable manner.''</p>
        <p>The result is a domino effect that ends up forcing the No. 4 Lexington Avenue express line, the most heavily used in the city, to operate irregularly, leaving some trains with too few riders and others so packed that the crowding slows the whole line, transit planners said.</p>
        <p>But opponents -- including several state Assembly members; Mark Green, the city's public advocate; and advocates for riders -- argued that the change would slow the commute for thousands in the Bronx, would do little to ease delays on the Lexington line and would also cause hundreds more commuters in the Bronx to switch to the No. 2 train at 180th Street to save time. The opponents said the switching would, in turn, slow down that line, causing more crowding on No. 2 trains in Manhattan and having the biggest impact at 72nd Street, one of the most crowded stations in the city during rush hours.</p>
        <p>Al O'Leary, the chief spokesman for New York City Transit, said yesterday that E. Virgil Conway, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, had asked transit planners last week not to make the change at least until the agency began to buy new subway cars that would add service on the No. 5 line and make the elimination of an express run less difficult for riders.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Leary said the service change would probably not be considered again until early 2002.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Jeffrey Klein, who represents the 80th District in the northeastern and northwestern Bronx, said yesterday that New York City Transit officials informed him on Friday that they had decided to leave the No. 5 line as it was.</p>
        <p>The change had been postponed several times over the summer in the face of mounting criticism, including a petition drive led by Mr. Klein and opposition from State Senator Guy J. Velella and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.</p>
        <p>''I've yet to find anyone outside of the Transit Authority who thought this would have been a good idea,'' Mr. Klein said. ''Their reasoning that this was going to solve problems and alleviate delays just did not ring true.''</p>
