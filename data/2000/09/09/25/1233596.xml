        <p>As in real life, accidents are not uncommon at the bridge table. A player misbids, or missorts, or pulls out the wrong card, producing in most cases an abnormal result.</p>
        <p>But such misadventures are rare in international play. In 1961 an Italian player with limited command of English announced ''seven spades'' when he meant to say ''six spades.'' His opponent, expecting a void in declarer's hand, was discouraged from leading an ace, and the grand slam thus succeeded. Today the use of bidding boxes prevents that particular accident.</p>
        <p>Another Italian was less fortunate on the diagramed deal from the quarterfinal of the Orbis world championships in Bermuda in January. He held the East cards and heard Nick Nickell, the American South, open four spades in third position.</p>
        <p>West bid four no-trump, which was apparently intended to show minor suits. Many experts would treat this as an unspecified two-suiter. Dick Freeman, North, then raised spades.</p>
        <p>One would expect East to bid six diamonds at this point, but he bid five no-trump and converted six clubs to six diamonds, perhaps an attempt to show maximum values. If this had been doubled, North-South would have collected 300 and achieved the par result. Five spades would have scored 450, and did in the replay with Italy sitting North-South.</p>
        <p>But Nickell had a freak distribution and not unnaturally pushed on to six spades. This could have been a triumph, for six diamonds might have been makeable, and six spades would have had good play if North had produced a doubleton heart or the heart jack. As it was, one down seemed the inevitable result.</p>
        <p>But East was the victim of an accident. South ruffed the opening diamond lead, drew trumps and led a heart to the ace. East played the jack. On the next heart lead, East produced the queen. South claimed his doubled slam for a score of 1,210.  East then discovered the wretched seven of hearts lurking among his diamonds.</p>
        <p>The Nickell team won the match by 8.5 imps, instead of losing by 15.5, and went on to capture the Bermuda Bowl title. East was tired after nine days of concentrated play, but one wonders why he had not spotted duplicated sevens in his diamonds.</p>
        <p>And if he thought he had six cards in that suit, an opening bid would have been plausible. His partner and teammates no doubt had something to say on the subject, but fortunately the rapid-fire Italian post-mortem would have been incomprehensible to the rest of the players.</p>
        <p>This missort changed world bridge history. But for it, Italy would have had a good chance to win the championship. The episode was reported by Harvey Bernstein in The Cleveland Plain Dealer and given wider circulation in Bridge Today Digest Online.</p>
