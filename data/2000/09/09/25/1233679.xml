        <p>Enthusiastic leaders of the opposition to President Slobodan Milosevic said early today that their candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, was leading by wide margins in watershed elections for president held on Sunday, but government spokesmen insisted that their sampling indicated that Mr. Milosevic was ahead.</p>

        <p>Enthusiastic leaders of the opposition to President Slobodan Milosevic said early today that their candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, was leading by wide margins in watershed elections for president held on Sunday, but government spokesmen insisted that their sampling indicated that Mr. Milosevic was ahead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic, who has ruled this country for the last 13 years, called the election nine months early -- after changing the Constitution in a day -- in an effort to prolong and legitimize his hold on power. While no official figures had been released six hours after the polls closed, opposition leaders said he had badly miscalculated in his first attempt at direct election since 1992.</p>
        <p>Certainly, government officials who had predicted an early evening declaration of victory for Mr. Milosevic in the first round, with the incumbent taking more than 50 percent of the vote, were mistaken. Some officials in Mr. Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party said privately that the mood was grim, and that there was some confusion about how to respond to the vote.</p>
        <p>There were indications early this morning that the Socialists might choose to allow a second-round runoff between Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Kostunica rather than simply declare victory by means of a voting fraud that could require Mr. Milosevic to claim a million phantom votes. A runoff on Oct. 8 would in effect challenge the opposition to respond in the streets if it felt cheated of a victory then.</p>
        <p>The United States and other Western powers have invested much effort and money in trying to unite Serbia's opposition, promote independent media and oust Mr. Milosevic, against whom NATO fought a three-month bombing war last year for control of Kosovo.</p>
        <p>An opposition spokesman, Cedomir Jovanovic, said the results he had received made it clear that a second-round runoff between Mr. Milosevic and his main opponent, a 56-year-old lawyer backed by 18 opposition parties, would be required if Mr. Kostunica did not win outright. Figures released by the opposition said turnout was nearly 78 percent in Serbia and about 25 percent in the tiny sister republic of Montenegro, whose pro-Western president had urged a boycott the vote.</p>
        <p>At 3:30 this morning (9:30 p.m. Sunday, Eastern time), Nikola Sainovic, the Yugoslav deputy prime minister and a spokesman for the Socialist Party, said that, with 900,000 votes counted, Mr. Milosevic was leading with 44 percent of the vote to 41 percent for Mr. Kostunica.</p>
        <p>Polling experts noted that a lower turnout would require Mr. Milosevic to win or manufacture fewer votes in order to claim a first-round victory.  The Radical Party of Vojislav Seselj, which is an increasingly disaffected partner of Mr. Milosevic in the government and is considered a watchful counter of votes in this election, offered a larger sample of 600,000 votes. That sample showed Mr. Kostunica with 49 percent to Mr. Milosevic's 41 percent. But again, it was impossible to judge how representative the sample was.</p>
        <p>Some Socialist Party officials were said to be arguing for a second round, hoping to keep the turnout down, but opposition leaders, pollsters and analysts believe that a second round would produce a definitive victory for Mr. Kostunica.</p>
        <p>People also voted for both houses of the Yugoslav Parliament and for local governments, but the counting of those votes is slower. The opposition claimed big victories in Belgrade, which it already controls, and said it had lost no towns.</p>
        <p>Vladimir Stambuk, vice president of the Serbian Parliament and a senior member of the party of Mr. Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, said, ''The turnout is very large, and it's clearly a kind of referendum.''</p>
        <p>Officials of the Serbian Renewal Movement, an opposition party which did not back Mr. Kostunica, said he was winning by wide margins over Mr. Milosevic in central Serbia and in large cities, while Mr. Milosevic was running ahead, though less dramatically, in more rural eastern and southern Serbia.</p>
        <p>The State Department said Sunday night that it believed that more than 70 percent of the population had voted in the election. ''We congratulate the people of Yugoslavia on their commitment to democracy,'' said Richard A. Boucher, a department spokesman. He said that there were numerous reliable accounts of irregularities during the voting.</p>
        <p>In Belgrade and other Serbian cities there were rival rallies and concerts. The opposition had planned to rally in the capital's Square of the Republic, but the government set up a loud concert instead. Some surprised opposition supporters yelled ''red thieves'' at the stage.</p>
        <p>The opposition moved down the street to a smaller square, and some 5,000 people gathered to hear scattered results, chant slogans and cheer for Mr. Kostunica. They chanted: ''Kostunica, save Serbia from this madhouse'' and ''Slobo, save Serbia and kill yourself.''</p>
        <p>The police separated the crowds but there was no violence.</p>
        <p>In Belgrade, Milan Spasic, a 52-year-old lawyer, said: ''We want change, but with this guy we'll never have it. We'll have only blood.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic, who was indicted last year by the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague, is  widely blamed for igniting the wars that marked the breakup of the old Yugoslavia in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Milos Cervenic, 26, a metalworker, spoke hopefully of an opposition victory. ''I'm expecting to live like a man at last, to not be ashamed of being a Serb anymore,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Montenegro, President Milo Djukanovic, who urged a boycott,  dismissed the elections as a show. ''Milosevic intends to continue his dictatorship in Belgrade,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Under the original Constitution, Mr. Milosevic could serve only a single term as president, which would end next July. His ally, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic, has said Mr. Milosevic will serve out his term no matter what the results of the elections may be.</p>
        <p>In Montenegro itself, the elections caused little stir, with a large majority not voting. Special police units loyal to Mr. Djukanovic were on guard at state buildings in full combat gear but Yugoslav Army units, whose commanders have openly supported Mr. Milosevic, mostly kept in their barracks.</p>
        <p>In Serbia and Montenegro there were complaints of electoral abuses, including inflated voter tallies, missing curtains and the banning of opposition monitors from a few polling places. The police and soldiers voted in barracks, away from the scrutiny of party representatives.</p>
        <p>In Kosovo, which is run by the United Nations, Western troops and officials attempted to keep a count of those who voted, to try to defeat any effort by Belgrade to inflate the numbers. Western officials said that fewer than 40,000 people appeared to vote. State news media said Mr. Milosevic had done very well in Kosovo.</p>
