        <p>John C. Malone and Rupert Murdoch are considering a deal that would increase their investments in each other's companies, according to people close to the discussions.</p>
        <p>The complex transaction would streamline the holdings of Liberty Media, the company controlled by Mr. Malone, and would give Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation a larger interest in Gemstar-TV Guide International, in which News Corporation already has a 20 percent stake.

        <p>John C. Malone and Rupert Murdoch are considering a deal that would increase their investments in each other's companies, according to people close to the discussions.</p>
        <p>The complex transaction would streamline the holdings of Liberty Media, the company controlled by Mr. Malone, and would give Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation a larger interest in Gemstar-TV Guide International, in which News Corporation already has a 20 percent stake. And the deal could put News Corporation in a better position to bid for the Hughes Electronics division of General Motors. G.M. has said it is considering an outright sale of the company, a merger or partnerships and joint ventures with other companies.</p>
        <p>Liberty Media is a tracking stock of AT&amp;T. Liberty's primary business is owning stakes in cable programming companies, including a 20 percent interest in Gemstar-TV Guide, which owns TV Guide and provides electronic program guides like VCR Plus. That stake is worth about $6 billion. Mr. Malone, the cable entrepreneur, is considering putting that asset, along with some cable holdings in Latin America, into News Corporation. In exchange, Liberty, which already owns 8 percent of News Corporation, would see its stake in the company increase to 20 percent and would receive stock in News Corporation's global satellite TV operations, which the company is planning to take public in the next month as a concern called Sky Global. Mr. Malone's willingness to take News Corporation stock is likely to be seen as an endorsement of that company.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Murdoch, the deal, which has been under discussion for months, would increase News Corporation's stake in Gemstar-TV Guide to 40 percent. It could also provide more financial strength in a bid for Hughes Electronics, which owns DirecTV, the satellite TV business. Mr. Murdoch has long wanted to expand his global satellite business, which includes British Sky Broadcasting, to include a United States operation, and the potential sale of Hughes affords that opportunity.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Murdoch declined to comment. Mr. Malone could not be reached yesterday.</p>
        <p>Because of the immediacy of News Corporation's Sky Global offering, along with any potential offer for Hughes, Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Malone are under more pressure to resolve their negotiations.</p>
        <p>But there are important issues to be resolved in the talks. For one thing, G.M. has told analysts it does not want News Corporation stock, or at least wants part cash and part stock, largely because News Corporation stock, tied as it is to the entertainment industry, is viewed as particularly risky. If Sky Global, however, were able to raise more capital, which a greater stake in Gemstar could provide, that might make a deal more attractive to G.M., as might the possibility of owning stock in Sky Global. But whether G.M. would take that stock is not clear.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the G.M. move, Liberty and News Corporation are likely to proceed with their talks. But it appears unlikely that Mr. Murdoch, who has zealously maintained the 30 percent control his family has of News Corporation, would give Mr. Malone anything but nonvoting stock. Two of his four children, Lachlan and James, work in the business.</p>
        <p>The deal is particularly complex because of Liberty's status as a tracking stock of AT&amp;T. It is not entirely clear whether Liberty could make such a deal without AT&amp;T's approval, and AT&amp;T, or even the government, might object to Liberty's attempt to increase its holdings in News Corporation.</p>
