        <p>Vice President Al Gore opened a week dedicated to highlighting his differences with Gov. George W. Bush over Medicare by asserting today that Mr. Bush's plan for providing prescription drug benefits would force some low-income elderly people to go to welfare offices to qualify. Mr. Bush's aides called that contention ''pure fantasy'' and ''a classic scare tactic.''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign, meanwhile, vowed to wage a war against America's ''education recession'' in the  week before the 2000 campaign becomes consumed by the long-awaited first debate between the Democratic and Republican presidential contenders. Aides at Mr. Bush's headquarters in Austin, Tex., buoyed by a polling rebound that accompanied the Texas governor's first good week in a month, also disparaged Mr. Gore for what they portrayed as his recent misstatements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's comments came in a 25-minute conference telephone call with reporters this afternoon from his official residence at the Naval Observatory here. The vice president departs on Monday for Florida, where he hopes to solidify his position among the state's pivotal elderly voters by releasing a new booklet containing his proposals for strengthening and expanding Medicare. He also plans to campaign this week in Michigan and Iowa before devoting the weekend to preparing for the first of three scheduled debates with Mr. Bush, on Oct. 3.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who spent the day in Texas and had no public schedule, embarks on a western swing to Oregon, Washington and California on Monday. By focusing on education, his campaign hopes to win over women, closing the gender gap that favors Mr. Gore. Bush aides also believe that the issue allows them to point to concrete accomplishments and statistics in Texas that demonstrate Mr. Bush's effectiveness in a given area of public policy.</p>
        <p>The week dawns with a series of polls showing the race tightening into a dead heat, underscoring the importance of the debates, on Oct. 3 in Boston, Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>A survey by Newsweek magazine gave Mr. Gore a lead of 3 percentage points, a gap within the margin of sampling error. Mr. Gore led by 14 percentage points in a Newsweek poll a week ago. A daily Gallup tracking poll showed Mr. Bush with a lead of 1 percentage point, while a Fox TV poll had the candidates even.</p>
        <p>The polls were taken during a week in which Mr. Bush seemed to regain his footing after nearly a month on the defensive. He did his best to keep attention focused on a series of Gore campaign missteps, charged Mr. Gore with political opportunism for calling for the release of oil from the country's strategic petroleum reserve, and accused his rival of ''misleading Americans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said today that he would remain focused on the issues, and said he would devote the week to discussing Medicare policy as a way to draw contrasts with Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''We have some real and very significant differences,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The other side treats the Medicare surplus as a piggy bank they can use for a tax cut that primarily benefits the wealthiest Americans. I'll veto the use of any money from Medicare for anything other than Medicare.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has proposed a plan to extend Medicare's solvency by five years, from 2025 to 2030, by placing the anticipated $400 billion, 10-year Medicare surplus in a secure fund that could be used to reduce the federal debt. That, he projects, would save $75 billion in interest payments that would be used, in turn, to shore up Medicare.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Gore would spend $338 billion over 10 years to provide a universal prescription drug benefit under Medicare. Individuals making about $12,000 or less would have their drugs covered without charge, while those with higher incomes would pay premiums on a sliding scale. The Gore plan also would spend $40 billion to increase funding for nursing homes, teaching hospitals, rural hospitals, home health agencies and rehabilitative services, all areas that suffered deep Medicare cuts under the balanced budget act of 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's Medicare plan, which would cost a total of $198 billion, would create a system where private insurers compete with the government to provide coverage.</p>
        <p>His market-based approach would essentially provide subsidies to older people who could spend the money on a variety of government-approved plans, some of which would include prescription drug coverage. For those with the lowest incomes, the government would provide drug coverage free. During the four years Mr. Bush estimates it would take to implement his plan, he would spend $48 billion on a temporary series of grants to states to subsidize coverage for the low-income elderly.</p>
        <p>''For the first five years, they would force many seniors to go to welfare offices to sign up for state programs,'' Mr. Gore said, ''and middle-class seniors would be left out completely.''</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said that the welfare office accusation was wrong and that Mr. Bush's plan would expand on an existing program in 23 states where applicants return forms by mail.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore spent last week making things up and today he's continued,'' Mr. Fleischer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's assertion of an ''education recession,'' a phrase that aides said tested well in internal campaign polling with women and independent voters, will coincide with the release of a Republican National Committee advertisement that makes the same point. The campaign will attempt to back up the charge by discussing declining test scores, safety concerns, and widening achievement gaps between rich and poor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer used the phrase several times in a conference call with reporters today, saying the recession had ''been present for the last 10 years,'' a span that dates to President George Bush's administration.</p>
