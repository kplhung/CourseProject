        <p>AT the recent Florida Trade Expo in the American Chamber of Commerce here, a middle-aged man in a crumpled business suit stepped up to a lectern that held a laptop computer and, with two fingers, began to tap out responses to the onscreen questionnaire. Name. Company. Number of employees.</p>
        <p>As he filled in the form, the staff from 1hemisphere.com -- a Miami-based Internet company specializing in hemispheric trade -- explained the benefits of his free membership: free e-mail; Web service for his company's site; and a free virtual storefront to transact business.</p>
        <p>With his registration complete, the small-business man, whose Brazilian company exports technological components to Europe, shrugged. ''We'll see what it is going to do for me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Employees from 1hemisphere.com, along with one of its competitors, latintrade.com, had come from Florida to Brazil to participate in the trade show and try to convince the local small and midsize businesses that a revolution is afoot. Operators of these so-called e-marketplaces -- Internet portals through which companies do business with one another -- are betting on the democratizing power of the Internet to break down the traditional information and trade barriers that confine most small companies in Latin America to doing business within 30 miles of home.</p>
        <p>The benefits of e-marketplaces for Latin America are potentially enormous. With help from the Internet, sellers could reach a significantly wider base of clients, raising profits for 10 million small companies that still serve as the main employers and drivers of growth throughout the region.</p>
        <p>With greater access to information, buyers, in turn, might get a better price in a more globalized market, increasing competitiveness all around. And everyone could save money, compared with the costs of closing the same deals in a world based on faxes and phone calls.</p>
        <p>But revolutions don't happen in a day. E-marketplaces are still struggling to work out the kinks that so far have impeded Latin America's small businesses from reaping the benefits of Internet-based trade. The payoff, if it comes at all, may not happen for years.</p>
        <p>But the obstacles are not deterring Internet companies from racing to stake a claim in the market for business-to-business e-commerce in Latin America -- a market that is forecast to reach $5.5 billion a year by 2003, according to figures published in a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter report in February.</p>
        <p>''We have just had the big bang,'' said Anna Giraldo Kerr, research manager for IDC Latin America, an Internet consulting firm. ''Since we are still going through the whole evolutionary period right now, B to B still has a grace period,'' Ms. Kerr said, using industry shorthand for business to business. ''Once that settles, though, there is definitely going to be a shakeout.''</p>
        <p>Some marketplaces, like adquira.com by the Spanish giant Telefonica and artikos .com by Commerce One of the United States, may have the resources to survive a shakeout. Other independent start-ups like 1hemisphere.com may be under more pressure to use revenues to pay as they go.</p>
        <p>For the most part, hemispheric portals are following the lead of various e-marketplaces already in operation in the United States. The owner of a zipper company in Rio de Janeiro, for example, can post his products on a bulletin board on the 1hemisphere.com Web site. While surfing the site, a jeans maker in Lima, Peru, finds that the Rio zippers are cheaper than those available locally, clicks over to the zipper maker's Web site via 1hemisphere.com and places an order. From the 1hemisphere.com site, the zipper maker lines up a shipping company, calculates the price of import duties, converts the whole thing into Peruvian currency and e-mails a bill to the jeans maker.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, 1hemisphere.com earns a commission on the completed deal.</p>
        <p>''Over the last two years, we have seen that small businesses in Latin America are finding out that they get a better return on their money if they export, especially if they send their products into the North American market,'' said Jose Matto, president and chief executive of 1hemisphere.com. ''Part of what we are doing is just match-making.''</p>
        <p>But the challenges are huge, starting with the typical mind-set of the very professionals who are expected to use the service -- business executives who are battle-scarred by the region's history of economic troubles, like the sky-high inflation that once plagued Brazil.</p>
        <p>''During hyperinflation, you had to have an accounting system that was just the basics because if you forgot to actualize a price monthly or biweekly, you could lose 20 percent,'' said Jose Augusto Correa, director of the technology department at the Federation of Industries of the Sao Paulo state. By comparison, he said, the 2 or 3 percent in cost savings from adopting new technology had hardly seemed worth the effort.</p>
        <p>Mr. Correa said that greater economic stability had only recently encouraged companies to consider technical innovations. That may help explain why, among the 10 million or so small and midsize businesses in Latin America, only about a million have any kind of Internet connection.</p>
        <p>While substandard networks and high costs can partly be blamed for the delay to adopt new information technology, much of the reticence may also be psychological. The Internet may still be seen as too cold and anonymous in a region where many people are more comfortable sealing deals with a handshake and a thump on the back.</p>
        <p>To overcome such resistance, some portals are signing up large corporations to serve as anchor buyers. The premise is that small companies will be eager for the opportunity to land a big contract with a big customer they might not otherwise have access to. For example, Asista.com, another of the Miami crop of e-marketplaces, recently signed a letter of intent with the Mexican conglomerate Axa S.A. de C.V. to buy all its office supplies and equipment through the site.</p>
        <p>''It is not going to start from the small guys getting religion all of a sudden,'' John Mein, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Sao Paulo, said of the e-marketplace movement. ''It is going to push through the economy from the top down. For the small companies to compete, they are going to have to step up their investments in technology.''</p>
        <p>But even if more small Latin American companies do venture online, they will still face other obstacles to cross-border commerce. Shipping companies are few. Export financing is hard to come by. Legal issues can be confusing. And many costs remain hidden within stacks of bureaucratic paperwork. Through strategic agreements with banks and logistics companies, the region's e-marketplaces are just now starting to find ways to confront these problems.</p>
        <p>''All these models have to be proven, and they require the backing of banks and other institutions to prove that they are going to be done in the proper way,'' said Jaime Vargas, chief executive of Mercantil.com. ''It will require some time.''</p>
        <p>Time, of course, takes money. Which is why the region's e-marketplace players will need to fine tune their approaches and marshal their resources, if they hope to be still in business when the revolution finally catches up with them.</p>
