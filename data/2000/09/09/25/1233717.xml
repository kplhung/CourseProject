        <p>Last September, with a week to go in their season, the Mets played a 3-2 game at Veterans Stadium and lost for the sixth day in a row. They took a bus back to Shea Stadium, lost two of three to the Atlanta Braves and needed help to make the postseason.</p>
        <p>The Mets and Phillies played to a 3-2 finish again today, but this time the Mets won. This time, they are playing well when it matters most, and their playoff fate is all but secured. With two home runs -- one inside the park, one out -- and eight sparkling innings from Glendon Rusch, the Mets clinched a tie for the National League wild-card berth.</p>

        <p>Last September, with a week to go in their season, the Mets played a 3-2 game at Veterans Stadium and lost for the sixth day in a row. They took a bus back to Shea Stadium, lost two of three to the Atlanta Braves and needed help to make the postseason.</p>
        <p>The Mets and Phillies played to a 3-2 finish again today, but this time the Mets won. This time, they are playing well when it matters most, and their playoff fate is all but secured. With two home runs -- one inside the park, one out -- and eight sparkling innings from Glendon Rusch, the Mets clinched a tie for the National League wild-card berth.</p>
        <p>The Mets lead Los Angeles by six games and Arizona by six and a half for the wild card. The Diamondbacks will be eliminated if they lose at Colorado on Monday, the Dodgers if they lose at home to San Francisco on Tuesday. Then again, one more Mets victory will put them into the playoffs for the second year in a row, something they have never done.</p>
        <p>The Mets took the last three games from the Phillies in this series and the final game in Atlanta the series before. They went 6-5 on a road trip that followed a horrible beginning of September.</p>
        <p>''Where we are today is 89 wins under our belt, a four-out-of-five win streak, feeling good about ourselves,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''I thought that before the month ended we'd feel good, and we're feeling good. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and I think we're a pretty strong group right now.''</p>
        <p>That strength is reflected in their confidence, catcher Mike Piazza said. A few days ago, he said, the Mets got fed up, and their attitude changed. ''We've got a little bit of swagger back,'' Piazza said.</p>
        <p>Off the field, the Met with the least swagger is Glendon Rusch, the 25-year-old left-hander with the chipper disposition of the hero in a children's sports novel. He is earnest and unfailingly polite, and, Valentine said, he may not have been shaving when he got to the Mets last September.</p>
        <p>When Rusch (11-11) was competing for the fifth starter's job in spring training, the veteran Al Leiter pulled him aside. Leiter told Rusch he liked what he saw, but Rusch needed to be meaner, to project an attitude that says, ''I'm going to get you.''</p>
        <p>''A lot can be said for a pitcher's demeanor, how he looks on the mound during his delivery and between pitches,'' Leiter said. ''He's got it. He's getting it.''</p>
        <p>Leiter sees that in the way Rusch tugs on his cap and stalks around the mound, how he quickly sweeps the dirt off the pitcher's rubber with his cleats and takes ownership of the game, especially when things go wrong. He stays confident, Leiter said, and Rusch needed that after his last start.</p>
        <p>Rusch was blown out last Tuesday in Atlanta, and he acknowledged, ''It's such a mental struggle when things like that happen.'' But, Valentine said, Rusch showed his toughness again with what might have been his best game this year.</p>
        <p>For the 10th time in 29 starts, Rusch issued no walks. He allowed five hits, striking out seven in eight innings. The Phillies' only run came on a groundout after Pat Burrell doubled on a ball that Timo Perez misjudged. Rusch had command of all his pitches, and Valentine thought his curveball was the best it had been all year.</p>
        <p>The Mets got their first run in the third inning, when Perez lashed a ball to center. Doug Glanville charged in but slipped, the ball bouncing high off the artificial turf and rolling to the fence. Perez circled the bases, sliding into home well ahead of the throw for his first career home run.</p>
        <p>The Phillies' starter, Bruce Chen (7-3), gave up only two more hits in eight innings, but one of them was a two-run homer to Todd Zeile in the fourth.</p>
        <p>It was Zeile's fourth homer on the trip, and after starting slowly in September, he feels good again because of his patience. The homer traveled to right-center, the opposite way, a sign to Zeile that he is not overeager.  Zeile drew eight walks in four games in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>''When you go through a cold stretch, you have a tendency to try to get out of it now, now, now,'' he said. ''So I was hitting the first thing that came over the plate, putting bad swings on the ball and getting myself out. I've always been a guy that takes the count deep, with two strikes. I had to get back to that.''</p>
        <p>Zeile's home run was the difference, because the Phillies used an infield single, a walk and a bloop single to center to score a run off Armando Benitez in the ninth, cutting the Mets' lead to 3-2. But Benitez struck out Marlon Anderson with runners on second and third to end the game and earn his 40th save, thumping his chest with his fist after the 98-mile-an-hour third strike.</p>
        <p>The Mets are confident again, just in time for another series with Atlanta this week at Shea. The Braves will hold a three- or four-game lead on the Mets in the National League East, depending on their game with Montreal on Monday night. Time has probably run out on the Mets' division title hopes, but one week before the postseason, they are building momentum at last.</p>
        <p>''We're not backing into anything,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Left fielder BENNY AGBAYANI (strained right hamstring) missed his second start in a row Sunday. He was feeling better, he said. ''But you don't know,'' he added. ''One day you could feel good and go out and probably blow it out again.'' . . . BOBBY VALENTINE seems to be strongly leaning toward including infielder MATT FRANCO on the postseason roster.</p>
