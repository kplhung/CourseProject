        <p>Cruise the chat forums on Style.com, a joint effort from Vogue and W magazines, and you will get a taste for the gossip that the fashion industry and its onlookers churn out with particular gusto.</p>
        <p>A TV personality is a ''twit.'' Two party-prone heiresses are ''spoiled brats.'' One actress is ''a boozer.'' That married magazine figure is cheating on his wife -- with an employee! A pair of famous actors were caught having sex in Bliss, a spa favored by the fashion set. That young actor favors ''speedballs,'' an injected mixture of heroin and cocaine. And that style maven? She is a closet lesbian.</p>
        <p>Vogue has long been known for its cool and distant elegance, as well as for lively journalism by writers like Julia Reed and Jeffrey Steingarten. But the Style.com chat rooms clearly show a distinctly different side of the magazine's personality.</p>
        <p>The gossip forums have become a daily Internet stop for many people in the fashion industry since they were introduced last September. They are vicious. Protected by anonymity, senders are free to sling as much mud as their slender arms can hurl. Last Friday, the forums carried giddy missives exulting about the reported death of a young actress and speculation that the secretly gay husband of a well-known socialite married her for her wealth.</p>
        <p>Until this week, the gossip forums belonged solely to Vogue.com; with the inception of Style.com last week, W magazine's  name began appearing on the site. Style.com incorporates fashion reporting from Vogue and W and will eventually include material from other titles owned by the Conde Nast and Fairchild units of Advance Publications. It will also sell clothing through an arrangement with Neiman Marcus. The gossip forums, of course, are a great way to attract eyeballs.</p>
        <p>Jeannette Walls, a gossip reporter for MSNBC and author of ''Dish: The Inside Story on the World of Gossip,'' said the Style.com forums reflect the fashion world's sometimes cruel penchant for gossip.</p>
        <p>''The truth is, everybody in fashion loves to gossip, whether they will admit it or not,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Walls noted that many of the items she read were ''the kind of really nasty stuff that no one will talk about and no one will publish, which makes it great for readers, but not great for Vogue.''</p>
        <p>''They are not going to stand up and talk about this Web site at a lunch for advertisers, I would guess,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Many magazines sponsor chat rooms on their Web sites. Eight of the 14 Hearst magazine Web sites have chat rooms, for example, but they tend to focus on specific subjects, like investing (on the Smart Money site) or the Boy-o-meter, where viewers are asked to rate a boy's good looks (on the Cosmogirl site).</p>
        <p>''I am such a Pollyanna when it comes to this stuff,'' said Atoosa Rubenstein, editor in chief of Cosmogirl. ''We want to create a really positive environment for girls.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Rubenstein said she did not monitor the site to make sure no one was posting anything offensive to Pollyannas like herself.</p>
        <p>Most Internet service providers employ what is known in the industry as ''T.O.S. police,'' or monitors who police the sites to make sure that subscribers are following the service provider's terms of service.</p>
        <p>Goli Sheikholeslami, Style.com managing director, said Style.com is overseen by Conde Net, the Internet arm of Conde Nast, which monitors all postings and removes any that are distasteful.</p>
        <p>''Anything that is uncivilized, we make an effort to remove,'' she said.</p>
        <p>So why did postings -- up on the site while Ms. Sheikholeslami spoke to a reporter -- refer to several famous people, revealing their drug or sexual habits in decidedly untasteful language?</p>
        <p>''That is not civilized,'' she said. ''We will make an effort to better monitor the forums in the future.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sheikholeslami added: ''And there are several people going through them as we speak, cleaning them up.''</p>
        <p>There is one thing to be said for the gossip forums: Even if the missives are unfair, Conde Nast employees are treated as unfairly as anyone else. On the forums, Conde Nast executives are the targets of salacious morsels. Ms. Sheikholeslami said that Conde Nast employees are not granted immunity from the gossip mill. ''The standard is the same for everybody, whether you work at the company or not,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Some Style.com viewers have complained about the meaner stuff. One, using the name Young Socialite, wrote last month: ''This is such a mean-spirited, cruel and stupid site. The people that are written about are being abused because none of what is written is true.'' Occasionally, even the subjects will respond to the anonymous attacks. In August, Samantha Ronson, a disc jockey, said she had finally decided to defend herself under her own name after weeks of weathering gossip aimed at her.</p>
        <p>Is Conde Nast liable if someone posts a report that a former ''Beverly Hills 90210'' star is a drug addict? The Telecommunication Act of 1996 essentially grants online services immunity from prosecution over such matters, but some lawyers believe that may be changing.</p>
        <p>Slade Metcalf, a lawyer in New York who specializes in media law, said that viewers who post libelous gossip may, in fact, become the subjects of lawsuits. More and more potential plaintiffs are subpoenaing Internet service providers to learn the identities of the anonymous people who make statements on Web sites or in direct e-mails, Mr. Metcalf said.</p>
        <p>''The question is to what extent Web site owners and Internet service providers need to provide that information, and that is a gray area,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Metcalf added that there have been recent cases in which potential plaintiffs have discovered the identities of people who have posted offending statements.</p>
        <p>''Those cases are the ones leveled by individuals or corporations who are willing to spend the money to find out who the people are who are placing offending statements about them on the Internet,'' he said. ''It's a new area and those individuals who thought they were going to be free of any liability because their real names are not attached to the notices are going to find out that is not the case.''</p>
        <p>David S. Korzenik, a lawyer who teaches media law at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and who represented Spy magazine for 10 years, said more such suits are being filed.</p>
        <p>''Do we want to hold a Web site liable for the interaction on it?'' he asked. ''I don't think we do. But the lawsuits are all over the place. They are kind of ridiculous, but they are certainly happening with greater frequency.''</p>
