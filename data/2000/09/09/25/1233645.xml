        <p>IN the back country of Louisiana's bayous, Billy Tauzin was brought up to help the neighbors through hard times, eat ''anything that doesn't eat us first'' and steer clear of the dirty business of politics.</p>
        <p>Several decades later, Representative Tauzin, 57, moves with ease through the ornate halls and bistros of Capitol Hill, though he insists a simple pledge not to embarrass his father, a poor electrical worker now dead, still echoes in his ears.</p>
        <p>''He begged me not to run the first time I decided to run,'' Mr. Tauzin, a 10-term congressman, said in a recent interview. ''He didn't want his son living in what he thought was a corrupting world.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tauzin, who stands to inherit control of the influential Commerce Committee if Republicans retain control of the House, navigates the murky waters where Washington meets corporate America with a shrewdness that has earned him the nickname Swamp Fox.</p>
        <p>The lawmaker, who recently seized the national spotlight by holding hearings on Firestone tires, acknowledges that he is a mix of contradictions. He leads a panel on consumer advocacy, yet he is passionate about deregulation. He built a career as a Democrat, then defected to the Republican Party in time to sign the ''Contract With America'' in 1995. He is a populist who holds lavish fund-raisers, a partisan who covets civility, an outdoors enthusiast who gives conservationists heartburn.</p>
        <p>In the Firestone case, Mr. Tauzin, who typically spools out Cajun humor in policy debates, turned ferocious. He summoned the tire and auto company executives before his subcommittee on consumer protection and, cameras rolling, slammed them for ignoring a mounting death toll from accidents.</p>
        <p>''This is a great case where we had a big responsibility to leap in with both feet and to strike out against what we have now discovered were some great failings on the part of Firestone and perhaps even Ford in protecting American lives on the highway,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some analysts attributed Mr. Tauzin's zeal to election-year politics; polls show Americans are outraged over the tire affair. There is no question that Mr. Tauzin is focused on November. He is a top fund-raiser for Republicans, helping pull in, by his count, ''well more than $8 million'' for candidates in tight races across the country. His Mardi Gras gala at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia was a hot ticket; cameras caught Mr. Tauzin chomping a cigar and embracing a contributor while a pig roasted on a spit nearby.</p>
        <p>House Republicans are on track to keep their slim majority, Mr. Tauzin said.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, it's close now,'' he said. But, he added, ''if the election were tonight, I think we'd gain seats -- two to four seats.''</p>
        <p>If Republicans prevail, Mr. Tauzin is prepared to use the Commerce Committee as a soapbox to focus attention on American energy policy and what he sees as a troubling lack of domestic fuel production.</p>
        <p>''Energy is about to blow into a higher profile position again before the Congress, and Commerce is going to be in the thick of it,'' Mr. Tauzin said. ''We have a growing demand for energy in this country and a policy against producing and refining in this country. Those things are going to collide.''</p>
        <p>The United States needs to open up more land to oil extraction and upgrade its refining and distribution networks, he said. Otherwise, the protests over surging gas prices that recently paralyzed Europe will spill over here, he said.</p>
        <p>''You become more and more vulnerable to supply interruptions and therefore price hikes and spikes. We're about to enter that. Secondly, our utility grids are weak in many cases. We can expect blackouts and brownouts to increase in this country, some very serious,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tauzin is amused by concerns from environmental groups that he would spoil America to keep its engines humming. He considers himself a friend of nature and the product of an outdoor life, including years as a field hand digging shallots and potatoes.</p>
        <p>He leans into a stage whisper, ''On the other hand, I fight stupid government environmental regulations every chance I get.''</p>
        <p>SO runs Mr. Tauzin's sense of theater. When he decided to switch parties -- after fellow Democrats refused to yield him time to speak on the House floor -- he invited his constituents to a town meeting, broadcast by C-Span. Their verdict, he recalled: ''We don't care where you sit; we like where you stand.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mr. Tauzin presented the chairman of Microsoft, William H. Gates, with a lemon meringue pie, a reminder of a pie that had been thrown in Mr. Gates's face by a Microsoft critic. For many, Mr. Tauzin's message was plain: the prickly Mr. Gates needed to open up his heart -- and wallet -- to lawmakers in Washington. Mr. Gates obliged.</p>
        <p>Such stunts are favored by a man who performed Shakespeare in college (''Imagine a Cajun Hamlet,'' he said) and appeared on television with Martha Stewart to promote his book of down-home recipes, ''Cook and Tell.''</p>
        <p>The secret to a great gumbo is a good roux, the butter and flour base for the sauce, he said. The secret for surviving in a ''corrupting world'' is not much different, he said, ''Always remember where you come from and how you got there, and who you really answer to.''</p>
