        <p>A consortium led by the management team of the Seagram Company's spirits and wine unit has decided not to bid for the business, which is being put up for sale by Vivendi S.A., executives close to the group said today.</p>

        <p>A consortium led by the management team of the Seagram Company's spirits and wine unit has decided not to bid for the business, which is being put up for sale by Vivendi S.A., executives close to the group said today.</p>
        <p>Vivendi, the French telecommunications and utility conglomerate that is trying to transform itself into an entertainment giant, said in June that it would acquire Seagram. At the time, it said it would sell the spirits and wine division because it did not fit Vivendi's core strategy.</p>
        <p>Over the last several weeks, a handful of companies interested in acquiring the Seagram unit, which includes well-known brands like Chivas Regal Scotch and Captain Morgan's rum, have begun reviewing the books of the operation.</p>
        <p>Formal bids are expected to be made this week by Allied Domecq P.L.C. and a joint bid by Diageo P.L.C. and Pernod Ricard S.A. of France. Vin and Spirits, the Swedish company that owns Absolut vodka, may also bid in conjunction with a partner. Other bidders could include Bacardi, the rum maker, and Brown-Forman, which owns Jack Daniel's.</p>
        <p>Executives close to the consortium led by the management team of the Seagram's division said the consortium decided to abandon its plan despite lining up significant financial commitments from investors in Europe. The group felt pressure to remove itself from the auction, one executive said, because Charles R. Bronfman, Seagram's co-chairman, no longer supported a management-backed buyout and because a bid could jeopardize the managers' compensation package.</p>
        <p>While the executives insist that the consortium had enough financial backing, it remains unclear whether the group could have competed with the deep pockets of rival bidders like Allied Domecq and Diageo, both of which could justify paying a premium for the business because of the possible cost savings.</p>
