        <p>Stacey Nuveman turned her aluminum bat on a low inside pitch this afternoon. After nearly 10 innings of almost flawless work on the mound, Yanqing Zhang's arm had grown weary.</p>
        <p>The ball left the New South Wales Softball Center in a blink. It was a towering three-run shot just inside the left-field foul pole and it gave the United States a pulsating 3-0 victory in its Olympic semifinal game against China before a near-capacity crowd of 8,157.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the first leg of the United States women's softball redemption tour was complete. Under gray clouds and at times a drizzle, the Americans indeed lived to play another game.</p>
        <p>Team USA was scheduled to meet Australia in an elimination game tonight at 7:30 p.m. The winner will meet Japan in the gold medal game on Tuesday night. The Japanese beat Australia, 1-0, in the other semifinal when Keika Utsugi drilled a homer for the game's only run in the fourth inning.</p>
        <p>The United States won 112 straight games before they stunningly lost three straight in the tournament. Sandwiched around a 2-0 loss to China in 14 innings were losses to Japan, by 2-1 in 14 innings, and Australia, by 2-1 in 13 innings, on a shocking two-run home run that ended the game.</p>
        <p>''It's nice to get it done in dramatic fashion, but base hits work as well,'' said Nuveman, who went 2 for 4 today. ''We've just got to keep chugging along until we get it done.''</p>
        <p>Nuveman ended the drama today with her bat, but not before the United States' arms gave her the opportunity.</p>
        <p>With two out and Xiaoling Deng of China at third base in the top of the 10th inning -- the rules call for a player to be inserted at second base to begin each inning after the ninth -- Christa Williams froze Yanghong Yu of China on a 3-2 pitch. She sneaked a slow riser past the Chinese right fielder, pumping her fist as she skipped to the dugout to meet her pumped-up teammates.</p>
        <p>The Americans kept bailing themselves out, if not with pitching, then with superb defense. Williams, who relieved Michele Smith, was in trouble in the top of the ninth inning with runners on first and second. Yet a sparkling double play ended the inning.</p>
        <p>Smith, who left the game after eight innings after having allowed 5 hits and no walks with 10 strikeouts, pitched better when she was in danger. After Xia Mu doubled just inside the left-field foul line in the top of the fourth inning, Smith struck out Jian Xu and Fang Yan to end the threat.</p>
        <p>Yanqing pitched well, too. She faced 35 batters, allowed 3 hits and struck out 8 before she faced Nuveman. The tournament leader in strikeouts with 37 coming into the game, she windmilled through the American lineup for most of the day. But in the 10th inning, she walked Sheila Douty. With Jennifer Brundage already on second to start the inning, Nuveman drove the 2-1 pitch high and deep over the left-field fence.</p>
        <p>Beyond her game-winning blast, Nuveman, the catcher, was also the Americans' most valuable player on defense. Twice she threw out runners at first base who were napping between pitches, completely catching the Chinese off guard and motivating her teammates.</p>
