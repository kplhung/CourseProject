        <p>For three weeks, the Giants had done what they expected of themselves. As they defeated weak opponent after weak opponent, their confidence grew to the point where they considered tonight's game with the Washington Redskins their biggest contest in years.</p>
        <p>But the Giants quickly showed that the struggling Redskins may still lead the league in talent. The Giants' defense, so strong in stopping inexperienced offenses in previous weeks, allowed Brad Johnson to silence Washington's quarterback controversy. The Giants' offense sputtered for the entire game, the first time this season it has been unable to move the ball.</p>
        <p>A Giants Stadium crowd of 78,216 had hoped the team's 3-0 start was not a fluke, but Washington's 16-6 victory prevented the Giants from seizing control of the National Football Conference East. They lead the division with a 3-1 record; the Redskins improved to 2-2.</p>
        <p>''We didn't play well enough to beat hardly anybody,'' Giants guard Glenn Parker said. ''Give them credit. They played at an incredible level. They played smart. They came out with a good game plan against us and they exploited weaknesses that maybe we didn't know we have, but now everybody's going to know that we have.''</p>
        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel noted that Washington played quicker and more aggressively than the Giants, and quarterback Kerry Collins said the Giants failed to raise themselves to the level of Washington's talent.</p>
        <p>''We played probably the same way we played the first three games and against a team like that, it's not good enough,'' Collins said. ''Against a team like that, maybe it's a good lesson because we have designs on having a good year. Maybe in the long run, this is kind of what we needed.''</p>
        <p>The Giants played as if they were overmatched. They had beaten Arizona, Philadelphia and Chicago, three teams that proved weaker than initially thought. Washington carried the baggage of an underachieving team and an overanxious owner, but it also brought a boatload of talent into the game.</p>
        <p>This was the Washington team many expected when it went on a shopping spree during the off-season. Fassel said he had predicted Washington would throw deep early and often. The Redskins did, and the Giants appeared defenseless. Johnson dissected the Giants' secondary, finally using the long pass successfully, completing 14 of 20 passes for 289 yards and 2 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>''That's called beating yourself,'' Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn said of the secondary's misplays.</p>
        <p>The Giants' special teams also faltered. When the Giants were about to get the ball back on a punt with two minutes left in the fourth quarter, the rookie Brandon Short was offside, giving Washington a first down and essentially ending the game.</p>
        <p>The Giants' offense, which looked so fluid through three games, was unable to mount any attack and showed problems playing from behind. The Giants' offense has revolved around the running game, but Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne totaled just 88 yards.</p>
        <p>After the first quarter, the Giants did not enter Washington territory until late in the third quarter. That drive ended at the 50-yard line after Kenard Long sacked Collins, who was pressured all night, for an 11-yard loss.</p>
        <p>The Giants' next drive went deep into Washington's side of the field, but Collins's pass from the 23-yard line to Ike Hilliard in the end zone was underthrown and intercepted by Deion Sanders, who returned the ball 28 yards.</p>
        <p>Collins's 7-yard touchdown pass to Hilliard with 2 minutes 25 seconds left averted the Giants' first shutout since 1996. Dayne was stopped short of the end zone on the attempted 2-point conversion.</p>
        <p>Collins completed 21 of 44 passes for 210 yards and a touchdown. He took the blame for the loss, although his teammates offered to take an equal share.</p>
        <p>''I appreciate what those guys say, but I'm responsible for this offense,'' Collins said. ''Put it on me.''</p>
        <p>The Giants trailed by 10-0 at halftime, and Washington did not allow the Giants to rally in the second half. The Redskins scored on the opening drive of the half, fueled by a 53-yard pass from Johnson to Albert Connell on third and three. Giants free safety Shaun Williams was covering Connell, but he fell out of bounds as Connell leaped for the catch. Connell also fell as he landed, but he rolled over and gained another 15 yards before he was tackled.</p>
        <p>On the next play, Johnson completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to Andre Reed, who was signed to replace the injured Michael Westbrook at wide receiver earlier this season. The half was less than two minutes old and the Giants trailed by 16-0, as the Redskins missed the extra point.</p>
        <p>The Giants were unable to produce anything close to their previous offensive output. Collins was sacked only three times in the Giants' first three games, but the Redskins had two sacks by halftime. Bruce Smith hit Collins for an eight-yard loss in the first quarter. Washington's Marco Coleman had the other sack, pinning Collins at the Giants' 8-yard line.</p>
        <p>Without the time he had grown accustomed to, Collins completed only 7 of 18 passes in the first half. That was well short of the 71.3 completion percentage he carried into the game.</p>
        <p>The touted running combination of Thunder and Lightning was not much better. Barber managed only 44 yards on nine carries, while Dayne totaled 11 yards on three rushes. The Giants had only 84 yards of total yards in the half, compared to Washington's 202.</p>
        <p>The Giants led the National Football League in time of possession entering the game, but trailed even in that category in the first half.</p>
        <p>The offensive star of the first half was the much-maligned Johnson. He kept his job this week after two consecutive Washington losses, but Jeff George was waiting on the sidelines. Johnson put the quarterback controversy to rest, at least temporarily, by completing 8 of 11 passes for one touchdown in the half.</p>
        <p>Johnson, a Pro Bowl selection who passed for more than 4,000 yards last season, had not completed a pass longer than 26 yards entering the game, and that was to a running back. His longest pass to a wide receiver went only for 22 yards. But the long pass was not a problem for Washington tonight. He completed passes of more than 26 yards three times in the first half.</p>
        <p>The Giants' defense walked off the field to cheers after forcing the Redskins to punt from their 28-yard line in the first quarter. But the defense allowed seven Redskins plays for gains in Washington's next series.</p>
        <p>Johnson completed a 46-yard pass over Giants cornerback Dave Thomas to wideout James Thrash in the second quarter to set up Washington's first score, a 23-yard pass to Irving Fryar for a 7-0 Redskins lead. That marked the first time the Giants had trailed this season.</p>
        <p>Washington's next possession featured a 48-yard completion to Connell. Johnson found Connell between Sehorn and Williams, throwing the ball just before Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead put Johnson on his back.</p>
        <p>There was one bright spot in the otherwise dreary half for the Giants. Redskins running back Stephen Davis, who ran for a total of 309 yards against the Giants last season, had only 27 yards on 12 carries in the first half.</p>
