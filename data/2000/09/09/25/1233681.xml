        <p>AND now another perspective on the agreement to ban soft money from New York's Senate race, widely hailed as a solid reform in these precincts and many others. Representative Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton have, theoretically, made it harder for the influence peddlers to buy access with money, and that means a lot -- even if Mr. Lazio was partly motivated by having more ''hard money'' than ''soft money,'' and Mrs. Clinton had to be shamed into the deal because she's burdened herself with the opposite formula.</p>
        <p>The larger problem is the system, which just about everyone agrees is a mess -- even issues groups. But they are not happy at being asked to step aside.</p>
        <p>Kelli Conlin, executive director of New York State's National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, said yesterday that she was troubled by the ban on soft money because Naral wanted to run television commercials to explain its position and help get Mrs. Clinton elected.</p>
        <p>''We have a real institutional commitment to long-term campaign finance reform, but we feel that it is not right to have a reform that excludes the voices of independent organizations,'' Ms. Conlin said. ''We're really torn apart over this agreement, because we feel that in their frenzy of trying to negotiate it, we've been lumped in with those organizations set up specifically as negative advertising vehicles.''</p>
        <p>She said that her organization's board would meet tomorrow or Wednesday to decide whether to honor the ban.</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, which also supports Mrs. Clinton, will be meeting with New York United Teachers, the statewide teachers' organization, to figure out a strategy. Her inclination is to go along with the agreement, but Ms. Weingarten has qualms, too.</p>
        <p>''Since the campaign made an agreement in good faith, we are going to take that very seriously, but we don't like it,'' Ms. Weingarten said last night. ''For those of us who believe in issues, it's a real First Amendment concern.''</p>
        <p>Right now, the system is a maze. Contributions to federal campaigns are limited to $1,000 per contributor in general elections, not a lot given the cost of television ads. So politicians figured out a way to skirt the rules -- having state and federal political committees raise and spend unlimited, unregulated money ostensibly to promote their philosophies and parties, but really to promote their favorite candidates. Theirs is ''soft money.''</p>
        <p>THERE are also independent issues or advocacy groups, like unions. And organizations created specifically to try to defeat a candidate. Under the Constitution, those groups can spend all they want, no matter what candidates say. And so some advocacy groups are not happy and, legally, they can do what they like.</p>
        <p>That is why even McCain-Feingold -- the leading campaign finance measure in Washington -- has its limits. If approved, it could run into the same resistance and problems as the New York pact has. In its latest version, the measure would not ban spending by independent groups.</p>
        <p>One of its strongest opponents in its last go-around was the National Right to Life Committee, resistant for the same reason Ms. Conlin, on the other side of the abortion rights issue, is so troubled.</p>
        <p>''There are right-to-life groups, the Sierra Club, police groups, unions, gay and lesbian organizations, everything you can imagine, a huge number of groups on both sides,'' said Ms. Conlin, whose organization had planned to spend $500,000 on its pro-Clinton effort. ''People are saying you can do this other stuff, mailing, phone banks. But we are doing that already. If advertising weren't so pervasive and effective in reaching so many voters, this wouldn't be such an issue.''</p>
        <p>Now Naral is weighing its next step. Though hesitant, it will probably go along with the agreement, but if it or any other group does not, the other candidate could spend proportionately. How do campaigns monitor that, though? ''It's murky,'' one Clinton adviser conceded.</p>
        <p>The issues are so complex, and the ability of politicians and campaign donors to find ingenious ways around campaign finance systems so great, that while this agreement may last through the New York Senate campaign, it probably will not set a new national standard. But now the issue is getting the public's attention. ''Campaign finance reform has to be revisited after this election,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ''The bottom line is, there is so much money involved in this process, something has to be done.''</p>
