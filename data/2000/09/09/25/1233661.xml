        <p>Jason Maynard loves his grandfather and wishes he were still alive. But sometimes he thinks it may be just as well that his grandfather, Marion Crank, died in 1994, before Bill Clinton's presidency had so many dents.</p>
        <p>His grandfather, a 20-year veteran of the Arkansas Legislature, had a fondness for Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''Grandfather was around to see him elected president in 1992, but not the rest of it,'' said Mr. Maynard, a marketing manager for a publishing company who recently left Little Rock to work in Chicago. ''In a way I'm glad he never saw what happened.''</p>
        <p>But his grandfather, who died at 79 and has a bridge named for him in Little River County, would have found good in Mr. Clinton's flawed presidency and would not have been surprised that it endured, Mr. Maynard said.</p>
        <p>''Knock him down, and he keeps coming back,'' his grandfather said of Mr. Clinton at a 1981 Democratic fund-raiser, as Mr. Clinton was trying to rebuild his political career after losing re-election as governor in 1980.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Crank died, Mr. Clinton called his widow to offer his sympathies -- from the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>This past week, as the long-running Whitewater investigation concluded that there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against Mr. Clinton, so, too, evaporated the threat of one more blemish on his battered presidency.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it is the final one, say some in his home state, as his presidency nears its end and Arkansans here and around the country form his legacy in bars, cafes, boardrooms, church pews and construction sites.</p>
        <p>But there is more to it than the usual breakdown of likes or dislikes, divided by party lines. His strength was always said to be his personal touch, Arkansans say, so it is only natural that they take his life personally.</p>
        <p>''He had tremendous talents and abilities, and they were misguided,'' said Edward M. Penick Sr., who was born in Little Rock in 1922 and has lived here all his life.</p>
        <p>Like many here, Mr. Penick speaks of Mr. Clinton with a mix of sadness and weariness.</p>
        <p>''I'll remember him as a person who could have done a lot for this country, but somewhere in his makeup he lost character and integrity, and that's tragic,'' said Mr. Penick, a retired banker.</p>
        <p>''He's still trying to establish his legacy, and I don't think it will be what he thinks it will be. The power of the presidency fed his ego, and he thought no one could do anything to him.''</p>
        <p>He does not hate Mr. Clinton, he is only disappointed in him.</p>
        <p>''In Arkansas, he's remembered as a great embarrassment,'' Mr. Penick said.</p>
        <p>Others said they were tired of the ribald jokes and the talk show jabs that are finally beginning to subside now that Vice President Al Gore and  Gov. George W. Bush of Texas are providing fresh material.</p>
        <p>''It gave us a black eye, but not a lasting one,'' said Martin J. Borchert, an affluent retired contractor who was Little Rock's mayor from 1967 to 1968. ''We'll get over it, if we haven't already.''</p>
        <p>Others said Mr. Clinton never did much for the state that was his springboard to the presidency, that he did not deliver even one interstate highway, a sore point here.</p>
        <p>But as easy as it is to find someone who regrets this state's connection to Mr. Clinton, it is just as easy to find someone who would vote for him again -- for president, for governor, for anything.</p>
        <p>In the dust of a construction site on the northwestern edge of downtown, Robert J. Keeling wiped the grime and sweat from his face and thought back on a quarter century of Bill Clinton-style politics.</p>
        <p>The sex scandals did not turn Mr. Keeling, a carpenter with a master's degree in education, from Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''It didn't bother me much,'' Mr. Keeling, 45, said. ''If you did a roll call in Congress on who'd had an affair, hands would go up all over the place'' if the lawmakers were honest about it, he said.</p>
        <p>Whitewater meant nothing to him.</p>
        <p>The economy stayed strong, and there was plenty of construction work. On Friday, he and other workers labored to transform an old Oldsmobile dealership on the edge of downtown into a temporary warehouse for Mr. Clinton's papers. A permanent library is planned.</p>
        <p>''He didn't start with much,'' said Mr. Keeling, with admiration.</p>
        <p>''He wasn't born rich. Look where he got. He did us proud,'' he said, and then paused, thinking. ''Proud enough.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maynard said there was no pure right or pure wrong in the legacy.</p>
        <p>''He survived Monica,'' Mr. Maynard said. ''He survived Whitewater. And now Al is looking pretty good,'' he said, weighing Mr. Gore's chances of winning the presidency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maynard said he believed Mr. Clinton was not the pure political animal he had been called. ''He does care about people,'' he said. That, he said, is not an act.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in the city, people say Mr. Clinton's legacy will be one of neither great pride nor great embarrassment.</p>
        <p>''I think history will treat him well, when it's all said and done,'' said Joe D. Bell, the son of a state senator and a senior partner in the influential law firm Friday, Eldredge &amp; Clark here.</p>
        <p>''He may not be a superstar president, but he won't be remembered as a Herbert Hoover,'' Mr. Bell said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell said that reaction from outsiders to his being from Mr. Clinton's state is neither always good nor always bad.</p>
        <p>''I get a mixed reaction when I travel out of state,'' he said. ''Some people ask if it's as bad as they say it is, but others say he's a sharp guy, and we're glad you gave him to us.''</p>
        <p>In a way, Mr. Bell said, Mr. Clinton's success -- and then his survival -- may have actually improved the way some Arkansans feel about themselves.</p>
        <p>''Clinton's enduring strength is that he never quits,'' Mr. Bell said. ''It's just another example of the true grit of Arkansans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's legacy is formed in Mr. Maynard's mind.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maynard says he will have regrets about Mr. Clinton, of unrealized potential, of a potentially great but flawed man.</p>
        <p>But he says that when he thinks about Mr. Clinton, whom he has voted for as long as he has been old enough to do so, he thinks about the day his grandfather died and how the phone rang in his grandmother's house, and Mr. Clinton's words.</p>
        <p>''I'm sitting here in the Oval Office, thinking about the good times Marion and I had,'' Mr. Maynard recalled Mr. Clinton saying.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maynard said he would never regret giving that man his vote.</p>
        <p>''He is an impressive person,'' he said. ''Anybody who doubts that should just be introduced to him, and after two minutes of conversation, they would know that.''</p>
