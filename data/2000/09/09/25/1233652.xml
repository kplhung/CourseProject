        <p>Having won pledges from the world's major central banks to support the euro, Europe's downtrodden single currency, the European Central Bank will have its toughness and its credibility tested on Monday by foreign exchange markets.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the European bank bought up billions of dollars worth of euros and was joined by the United States Federal Reserve as well as the central banks of Japan, Britain and Canada.</p>
        <p>Catching the markets by surprise, the central banks announced their ''shared concern'' about the euro's precipitous decline and suggested that they would intervene again if the euro's value against the dollar did not increase.</p>
        <p>For the European Central Bank, which assumed power when the euro was born on Jan. 1, 1999, a successful intervention is crucial for its credibility and that of the currency itself.</p>
        <p>Financial officials from Europe, the United States and Japan, who were here in Prague this weekend for meetings of the International Monetary Fund, spent much of the weekend talking up their commitment in the hope of jolting currency markets when they open for business on Monday.</p>
        <p>''Markets understand that there is a clear will not to accept an undervalued euro,'' said Horst Kohler, managing director of the fund.</p>
        <p>Ernst Welteke, president of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said he was pleased at how well the intervention has gone so far.</p>
        <p>But experts and currency traders are uncertain. The intervention on Friday appears to have involved only a few billion dollars and may have little long-term impact if it is not followed up by more waves of euro-buying and dollar-selling.</p>
        <p>If the intervention has little effect and if central bankers do not intervene again, experts say, the damage to the currency will be much worse than if they had not decided to intervene at all.</p>
        <p>Few people are more aware of the risks than the president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg of the Netherlands. Like many other central bankers, he is skeptical about the value of intervention. In December, when the euro sank below parity against the dollar for the first time, he was determined to wait for the markets to correct themselves.</p>
        <p>When the euro's value fell to 88.4 cents in early May, Mr. Duisenberg came under increasing pressure from political leaders to intervene. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France called for ''joint action'' to shore up the euro and even proposed strengthening the role of  finance ministers of countries using the euro in monetary policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duisenberg did not budge, though he did issue a formal statement expressing sympathy with those who were alarmed by the euro's decline.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duisenberg has been careful not to spell out his goals or to suggest how much money the central banks are willing to commit to rescuing the euro. But he seems determined to push its value up rather than simply to stabilize it, and anything short of an increase will be taken by markets as an even greater proof of the euro's dim prospects.</p>
