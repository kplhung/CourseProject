        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday brushed off criticism directed at him by William J. Bratton, the former police commissioner who is a possible Republican candidate for mayor, and mocked him for staying as a guest in the White House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bratton was quoted in a Daily News column yesterday as saying that the mayor ''has missed a great opportunity to create better race relations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that the comments make no sense, given that Mr. Bratton had recently praised his leadership as mayor.</p>
        <p>''Now he is saying very nasty things,'' the mayor said, noting that the criticism came after he announced he would work to prevent Mr. Bratton from getting the Republican nomination. The mayor also poked fun at Mr. Bratton's inclusion on a list of guests invited to stay at the White House. ''I imagine while he was in the Lincoln Bedroom, he was dreaming of being a Republican,'' Mr. Giuliani said. Mr. Bratton could not be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
