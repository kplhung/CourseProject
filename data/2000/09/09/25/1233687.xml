        <p>Both Sides Claim Lead In Yugoslavia Voting  The opposition to President Slobodan Milosevic said its candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, was leading by wide margins in elections, but government spokesmen insisted that their sampling showed Mr. Milosevic ahead. Mr. Milosevic called the election nine months early after changing the Constitution, in an effort to prolong his 13-year hold on power.</p>

        <p>Nations Press OPEC on Prices  Industrialized nations claimed a breakthrough in their battle against high oil prices after persuading Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Russia and the United Arab Emirates to join them and other I.M.F. members in condemning current oil prices as harmful. OPEC will meet this week.</p>

        <p>The European Central Bank will be tested by foreign exchange markets this week, after an intervention late last week on behalf of the flagging euro. For the bank, which assumed power when the euro was born on Jan. 1, 1999, the success of the intervention is crucial for its credibility and that of the euro.</p>

        <p>Swiss Reject Immigrant Quotas  Swiss voters rejected a proposal to impose a constitutional limit on the percentage of foreigners in their country, apparently heeding government warnings that it risked harming the economy and ties with the rest of Europe. But nearly 40 percent supported the proposal.</p>

        <p>France Cuts Presidential Term  A referendum to cut the French president's term of office from seven to five years was overwhelmingly approved. The change, the most radical change to France's Constitution in 40 years, was overwhelmingly approved, but turnout was low.</p>

        <p>An Independent Streak Makes Wisconsin a Tossup  The race between Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore in Wisconsin is close. Like several other Great Lakes states, this is one of the year's main presidential battlegrounds, although it has only 11 electoral votes. The two nominees have spent $2.6 million in Green Bay and Milwaukee alone since June 1.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore asserted that Mr. Bush's plan for providing prescription drug benefits would force some low-income elderly people to go to welfare offices to qualify. Mr. Bush's aides called that contention ''pure fantasy'' and ''a classic scare tactic.''</p>
        <p>A21</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he did not have any knowledge of a ''mole'' providing his campaign with secrets about his opponent's activities. Mr. Bush's advisers said the Gore campaign's suspension on Saturday of a junior staff member who had boasted about a mole in the Bush campaign raised serious questions about what officials with the Gore campaign might know about the situation.</p>

        <p>Politics and Practicality on Oil  Despite the strong views of New Hampshire voters about President Clinton's move to release 30 million barrels of crude oil out of the national reserves, none of more than two dozen people interviewed in the state, where the presidential contest is still too close to call, said it would sway his or her vote.</p>
        <p>A21</p>
        <p>The Fund-Raiser in Chief  This year, President Clinton has raised about $90 million for Democrats, money that has been routed to the national party, to individual senators and representatives, to governors and state legislators. By Election Day, he will probably have raised more than $100 million.</p>
        <p>A22</p>
        <p>Debating Clinton's Legacy  Some people in Arkansas regret the state's connection to President Clinton after the Whitewater investigation, but others say they would vote for him again -- for president, for governor, for anything.</p>

        <p>Children Lack Media Guidance  The cultural debate has focused on violent films, recordings and electronic games and how they are marketed. But some childhood development experts say the issue is not just what children see, but how and where they see it. As more televisions, video games and computers find their way into their rooms, children are more isolated from parental guidance and control.</p>

        <p>Concerns Are Raised Over Prison Care Company  Prison Health Services, part of a corporation that delivers health care to 175,000 inmates in 27 states, is prepared to begin a nearly $100 million-a-year contract to care for 13,000 prisoners on Rikers Island and in other New York City jails. But some government officials and others who have monitored its performance say it has occasionally failed to deliver quality care and has had staffing and management problems.</p>

        <p>Sotheby's Approves Payment  Moving quickly to settle civil claims that it cheated auction buyers and sellers for years, Sotheby's board approved the payment of its half of a $512 million legal settlement Sotheby's and its arch-rival, Christie's, have reached with the plaintiffs. The bulk of Sotheby's payment will come from its majority shareholder and former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman. He will pay $156 million.</p>

        <p>Virus Is a Puzzling Adversary  This year's outbreak of the West Nile virus differed in many ways from last year's, underscoring how little scientists and health officials understand about the virus, and how hard it is to develop policies to deal with it.</p>

        <p>4 Die in Parking Deck Accident  Four longtime nurses at St. Vincents Hospital were killed yesterday in Virginia Beach, Va., when their car crashed through the wall of a fifth-floor hotel parking deck and tumbled 41 feet to the ground, the police said. The cause of the crash is still under investigation.</p>
