        <p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's proposal to build a football stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, perhaps for the New York Jets, has suddenly taken on new life. It has also generated understandable skepticism from New Yorkers. Nevertheless, the idea is more promising than it might seem at first. The Jets are said to be extremely interested. The earlier idea of moving Yankee Stadium to the West Side is effectively dead, especially now that Gov. George Pataki has come out against it. More important, City Hall and the governor's office are mulling some financial arrangements that might work and also speed the redevelopment of a poorly served and underutilized area of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki are both clearly thinking about their legacies, but that is no reason not to look searchingly at the stadium proposal being studied by their staffs. Three criteria should be applied in making a judgment about its worthiness. First, a stadium should have multiple uses and serve as an available annex to the Javits Convention Center, which needs to expand and construct a large meeting space if it is to lure the big meetings that increasingly are going elsewhere. Second, to avoid traffic congestion and air pollution, the project has to be served primarily by mass transit rather than automobiles. Third, it must pay for itself without large public subsidies beyond valid infrastructure projects. The surprise is that it may be possible to meet all three of these criteria.</p>

        <p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's proposal to build a football stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, perhaps for the New York Jets, has suddenly taken on new life. It has also generated understandable skepticism from New Yorkers. Nevertheless, the idea is more promising than it might seem at first. The Jets are said to be extremely interested.

        <p>Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki are both clearly thinking about their legacies, but that is no reason not to look searchingly at the stadium proposal being studied by their staffs. Three criteria should be applied in making a judgment about its worthiness. First, a stadium should have multiple uses and serve as an available annex to the Javits Convention Center, which needs to expand and construct a large meeting space if it is to lure the big meetings that increasingly are going elsewhere. Second, to avoid traffic congestion and air pollution, the project has to be served primarily by mass transit rather than automobiles. Third, it must pay for itself without large public subsidies beyond valid infrastructure projects. The surprise is that it may be possible to meet all three of these criteria.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner is said to retain his dream of moving to the West Side. But the time has come for everyone to recognize that this idea no longer makes sense, if it ever did. A few years ago, the Yankees' owner said box-office receipts in the Bronx were lagging. Today they are breaking records. If Yankee Stadium is rebuilt at its current site, the fans will come. The Yankees can have their luxury skyboxes, and the city and state can upgrade the subway, car, train and even water links in an economical fashion that would improve the surrounding area. The same can be done for the Mets in Queens.</p>
        <p>The West Side stadium idea is being pushed most aggressively by the organization that hopes to lure the Olympics to New York City in 2012. Obviously, a stadium south of the Javits Center has to rise and fall on its own merits, irrespective of what might happen with the Olympics. Enter the New York Jets, who currently play in Giants Stadium at the Meadowlands, the only professional football team that has to share a stadium with another professional team. The Jets' new owner, Robert Wood Johnson IV, evidently wants to move. The team ought to pay for the West Side stadium itself if the city and state help finance the cost of a platform over the railroad yards next to the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>What is most intriguing about the stadium proposal is its potential to redevelop the West Side south of 42nd Street, an area that now includes bus and truck parking lots, warehouses and other operations that could be moved to a less central location. As Charles Bagli reported last week in The Times, New York City is in desperate need of places to build new office space and housing. This page has called for the city to open up this area to commercial and residential development, a topic to which we will return from time to time. A transit station linking the stadium and the area to Amtrak, the Long Island Rail Road, Metro North and an extension of the No. 7 subway line is not an unrealistic idea. Public investment in such infrastructure would almost certainly generate new construction of offices, apartments and hotels. The use of incremental tax revenues from such projects could help finance the entire cost of construction.</p>
        <p>The stadium idea is drawing fire from community groups, elected officials and others worried about congestion, expense and pollution. Their concerns cannot be dismissed. But it would also be a mistake to dismiss the stadium proposal as just another wild idea. It deserves to be looked at skeptically but also with an open mind.</p>
