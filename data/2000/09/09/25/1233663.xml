        <p>Christie Ambrosi, the hard-hitting outfielder for the United States Olympic women's softball team, has long had friendly dealings with her hometown newspaper, The Kansas City Star. So, when asked, she readily agreed to write an Olympic diary for The Star's World Wide Web site.</p>
        <p>But shortly before she left for Sydney, Australia, in August, she sent an e-mail message to the newspaper, saying, ''As far as the diary entry, we aren't allowed to do them during the Olympics.'' The International Olympic Committee was putting teeth into its often-ignored rule against publication of athletes' Olympic diaries during the Games.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ambrosi was not alone. Siri Mullinix, the North Carolina-born goalkeeper of the women's soccer team, stopped her online chats with The Greensboro News &amp; Record and said she could not contribute a diary during the Games. The Hartford Courant got the same message from Karen Scavotto, the 18-year-old archer from Enfield, Conn.</p>
        <p>The 27th Olympic Games may be remembered for many things -- world records, peacetime logistical planning -- but it will surely be a benchmark in the struggle between those who hold intellectual property rights in sporting events and those seeking to cover sports, especially for the ever-expanding universe of news outlets on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Concerned that the power of the Internet could eventually undermine the economic foundation of the modern Olympic movement, the Olympic committee is going to great lengths to control how and where the images and accounts of the Sydney extravaganza reach the public. The committee's actions echo what is happening in other areas of sports, as both amateur and professional teams and leagues aggressively invoke their property rights to control how and by whom events are covered.</p>
        <p>Most of the committee's attention is focused on the Web. Here, streaming video -- still in its infancy -- may eventually attain both the technical quality and reach to cut into television audiences. This could, in turn, dilute the value of the most valuable asset of the Olympics: broadcasting rights. The Web could also spawn a horde of virtual storefronts where those with no rights to Olympic trademarks piggyback on the Olympic name to hawk their wares without returning anything to the nonprofit committee, which supports the athletes and the Games.</p>
        <p>The prospects are worrisome enough to make Olympic officials take a hard line now. No athlete diaries or online chats. No streaming video of events -- even months-old replays of the Australian Olympic swimming trials, as the Australian site www.ninemsn.com.au discovered. No use of the Olympic rings to promote news organizations' own Olympic coverage.</p>
        <p>Two months before the Games began, the committee filed a lawsuit in federal court in northern Virginia to dislodge 1,800 so-called cybersquatters, who had registered domain names using terms owned by the I.O.C. Names of the defendants took up 40 pages. The lawsuit is pending.</p>
        <p>More than 20 private Web monitors on three continents are using the latest search engine technology to monitor possible violations of the I.O.C.'s property rights.</p>
        <p>The strict enforcement of the diary rule hit local newspapers hard. Mike Fannin, the sports editor of The Kansas City Star, said, ''I would assume that it is their ball and if you want to play, you play by their rules.'' But, he added: ''The readers miss that connection with their local athlete. Christie Ambrosi's a softball player in the Kansas City suburbs. When she walks into a bar, people know who she is. The Olympics -- it's all about representing your hometown, your city, your country.''</p>
        <p>Franklin Servan-Schreiber, the director of communications and new media for the International Olympic Committee, is keenly aware of the tension between property rights and unfettered coverage of the Games. But, he said, ''I don't think the I.O.C. can be seen in any way limiting speech about the Olympics.'' He pointed out that 20,000 journalists are in Sydney -- nearly twice as many media people as athletes, all free to cover the Games as they see fit.</p>
        <p>It is also true that the most important pieces of news, the results, are released instantaneously and sent immediately by wire services to all publications, online and off. And any journalist can interview the athletes, he added. ''It's the most written-about event every four years,'' he said. ''We're very far removed from any notion of limiting speech.''</p>
        <p>The aggressive enforcement effort, he said, is meant to ensure that ''the association between the athlete, the sport, the values and the symbol that represents all this is clear.''</p>
        <p>The Internet has offered little revenue to the Olympics so far. There are concerns that the Web could cut into television audiences and undermine the economic underpinnings of the Olympic movement. The committee took in about $1.3 billion for television rights to the Sydney games alone. NBC paid $705 million for United States rights.</p>
        <p>And though great technological improvements are needed before the Internet can offer high-quality video to large audiences, the Web's reach still expands the power of once-small publications. The existing rule against diaries was never enforced against ''small newspapers,'' Mr. Servan-Schreiber said. Now, on the Web, ''nothing is small.''</p>
        <p>(At least one newspaper, however, has printed an athlete's diary without repercussions. The Newark Star-Ledger ran an account on Thursday from Joetta Clark Diggs, an 800-meter runner. An editor there said no sports officials had objected.)</p>
        <p>Still, the new emphasis on restrictions like the diary ban is at least puzzling to some.</p>
        <p>Floyd Abrams, a constitutional lawyer with Cahill, Gordon &amp; Reindel, said it was odd that ''the increased availability of a means of communication leads to a ruling seeking to assure that less is said.'' But he said the I.O.C. was not a United States agency and so was not bound by the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>The gradual fencing off of information and imagery by sports franchises was well under way before the Olympics. In the last few years, debates have been joined over whether game developments can be distributed instantly by pager (they can, a federal appeals court has ruled).</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, Nascar, the stock-car racing league, backed off an attempt to make reporters agree that Nascar was sole owner of ''images, sounds and data arising from and during any Nascar event'' -- including the racing times and scoring information.</p>
        <p>''They were saying, 'If it happens during the event, we own the intellectual property rights to it,' '' said Michael Persinger, the sports editor of The Charlotte Observer in North Carolina, the epicenter of the Nascar universe. ''You can't own the news.''</p>
        <p>For the International Olympic Committee -- a nonprofit organization that gives more than 90 percent of its revenue to sports federations, local Olympic committees, organizing committees of host cities and athletes -- the stakes in controlling the Web loom increasingly large, particularly in four, six or eight years, when streaming video on the Web may be far superior to the current fuzzy, jumpy images.</p>
        <p>All the issues raised by the Web will be discussed at an Olympic committee meeting in December.</p>
        <p>Thus far in the Games, The Associated Press's sports editor said, all scores had been sent out to news organizations instantaneously. ''It's been going fine,'' the editor, Terry Taylor, said.</p>
        <p>Given the 15-hour to 18-hour time difference between Sydney and the United States, many dedicated fans are turning to the Web for results. Traffic on the sports sections of all major sites, like sports.yahoo.com, msnbc.com and cnnsi.com, surged in the last week.</p>
        <p>Allen Weiner, NetRatings's vice president for analytic services, said he thinks the Web has not cut into the broadcast audience. ''People have been using it to determine what they want to watch on TV,'' he said. ''If you were a basketball fan and heard they had a close game against Lithuania, you might be interested in watching.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Fannin of The Star said, ''All these leagues are getting more proprietary about their rights and what's theirs and what's theirs exclusively -- especially when it pertains to the Internet.'' And when it comes to sports, ''it's a seller's market.''</p>
