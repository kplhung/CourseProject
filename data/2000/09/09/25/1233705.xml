        <p>The Jets scooped up receiver Vincent Brisby hours after the Patriots released him during training camp, hoping that Brisby would eventually become a starter.</p>
        <p>Instead, Brisby has been virtually invisible while the diminutive Dedric Ward, inserted into the starting lineup opposite Wayne Chrebet, has risen to the occasion.</p>
        <p>Today, the Jets put Brisby, a tall receiver in the mold of Keyshawn Johnson, on the inactive list for the game.</p>
        <p>Ward has 13 receptions for 262 yards in the first four games, with critical receptions in fourth-quarter scoring drives against Green Bay (a 61-yarder) and New England (44 yards). Brisby has 4 receptions for 60 yards.</p>
        <p>Dwight Stone, the kick-return specialist who was re-signed by the Jets this week, also was inactive. Laveranues Coles and Kevin Williams continued to return kicks.</p>
        <p>The other inactive players were: quarterback Chad Pennington, linebacker Courtney Ledyard, tackle Chad Slaughter, defensive tackle Maurice Anderson and defensive end Dorian Boose.</p>
        <p>First Career Catches</p>
        <p>Receiver Laveranues Coles and tight end Anthony Becht made their first professional catches in the first half. Coles caught a 17-yard pass on third-and-9 from Vinny Testaverde, who was under a heavy blitz. Coles's reception gave the Jets first-and-10 on the Tampa Bay 27-yard line. John Hall kicked a 41-yard field goal to complete the drive. Coles had another catch in the second quarter. Becht's reception, a 5-yarder, came on the first play of the second-quarter drive that led to Hall's second field goal. Becht finished with two catches for 20 yards and Coles had two for 34.</p>
        <p>Jets Get to Bucs' King</p>
        <p>Aaron Glenn intercepted Tampa Bay quarterback Shaun King on a pass intended for Keyshawn Johnson early in the third quarter. It was the Jets' second interception of King and just the second he has thrown all year.</p>
        <p>''They wanted a war, we gave them a war,'' Glenn said. ''You all thought they were a better team.''</p>
