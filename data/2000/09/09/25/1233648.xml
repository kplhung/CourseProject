        <p>When he left Notre Dame four years ago, he was painted as a cranky tyrant whose X's were so jumbled with his O's that they were pumping up an already colossal ego. When he showed up to coach South Carolina two years ago, it was perceived as a ticket-selling stunt by a football program that had been more P. T. Barnum than Bear Bryant and as a desperate encore for a once golden talent lost without the applause.</p>
        <p>Last season, when South Carolina went 0-11 to establish a nation-leading 21-game losing streak, the Lou Holtz-haters, and there are plenty, smiled smugly and perhaps thought about Frank Sinatra forgetting the words to his signature standards on those final tours he might have been better off canceling.</p>
        <p>For the Holtz-admirers, an ample constituency of their own, there were explanations. His wife, Beth, was fighting cancer for the second time and he was distracted. The old coach was taking care of his family by keeping the top spot warm until his son Skip could take over the team.</p>
        <p>So where is that crazy, old and addled Lou now? Back in the polls at No. 23 with an undefeated South Carolina (4-0) team that demonstrates how Holtz, 63, has always had a plan and is about to make it work again.</p>
        <p>''We have as good a chance of making a bowl game as Ralph Nader does winning the presidency,'' Holtz declared before the season began.</p>
        <p>The coach's wit is one of the reasons he is one of the most coveted speakers on the high-dollar rubber-chicken motivational speech circuit. The more important one is his record.</p>
        <p>Over 29 years in five previous coaching stops, Holtz has taken broken programs and by his second year put them back together in time for a bowl appearance. He did it at William &amp; Mary, North Carolina State, Arkansas, Minnesota and Notre Dame. He is the 11th winningest coach in the history of college football with a record of 220-106-7, has seven seasons with 10 victories or more and won the national title at Notre Dame in 1988 with a 12-0 team.</p>
        <p>How has he done it?</p>
        <p>With a three-pronged system that could fit in one of those palm-size books that are displayed near the cash registers of any Barnes &amp; Noble. 1: attract players who want to be good and will work hard. 2: make them work hard and produce. 3: teach them to be unselfish. Then, according to Holtz, he can teach the game of football and the team's goal finally comes in sight: perfection. He confesses no team can reach it, but the point is to strive for it.</p>
        <p>''I believe if you create the right attitude, you can win anywhere,'' he said Saturday after the Gamecocks defeated then No. 25 Mississippi State, 23-19. ''We've still got to recruit well. I thought we were able to attract good assistant coaches. We're not winning because of me. Trust me. We have a plan, we try to follow the plan. You can win at most places if you are together. We have a family atmosphere. Not just the team. It's the whole athletic department, the student body, everybody.''</p>
        <p>It took all of an 0-for-1999 season for the Gamecocks to understand the first two parts of the plan, and indeed, Holtz was distracted throughout it. Besides his wife's battle with throat cancer, which she again overcame, his mother, Anne Marie, died and Skip, his son and assistant head coach, was hospitalized with a severe gastric infection.</p>
        <p>Nobody likes being blanked for a full season, and the returning Gamecocks showed up en masse in the off-season for voluntary dawn weight-lifting sessions. They also surrendered to Holtz's motivational tricks. They moved into dorms at the coaching staff's urging. They rode to two-a-day practices in team buses. Some took their turn at a preseason team meeting and shared details of hard lives that choked many with emotion.</p>
        <p>Holtz the coach did his part, too. He scrapped South Carolina's offense and defense and pushed Skip and the staff to come up with schemes that took best advantage of the Gamecocks' admittedly limited talent. The power-rushing game was out; a more diverse four wide receiver and shotgun formation was in.</p>
        <p>Against Mississippi State, South Carolina quarterback Phil Petty had a career-high 305 passing yards, completing 19 of 40 passes. And his backup, Erik Kimrey, threw a 25-yard go-ahead touchdown pass with five minutes left in the game after Petty twisted his ankle.</p>
        <p>On defense, the Gamecocks switched to a more nimble 3-3-5 formation that allows secondary blitzes and linemen and linebackers to drop back into pass coverage. They are currently ranked No. 6 in the nation in total defense.</p>
        <p>When South Carolina won its first two games of the season, against New Mexico State and Georgia, fans stormed the field and felled the goal posts. No more. The Gamecock faithful believe -- especially the players.</p>
        <p>''People took us lightly going into this season,'' defensive back Rashad Faison said after Saturday's victory. ''But we knew we could do it. We are going to be a force in the SEC this year and for years to come.''</p>
        <p>Even though the Gamecocks are off to their best start since 1988 and three more victories will ensure a bowl appearance, Holtz is looking for something more -- the school's first winning record in Southeastern Conference play. So far, his golden talent remains intact. And if you still think the old coach has forgotten his lines, listen to this one.</p>
        <p>''I told the team we could play with anybody in the country,'' he said. ''Shortly, I will tell them which country.''</p>
