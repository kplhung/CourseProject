        <p>Six months ago, the platform diver Laura Wilkinson broke three toes on her right foot while training. With Olympic trials looming, she figured her dreams of Sydney fractured as well that day.</p>
        <p>But today Wilkinson roared from fifth place to capture the women's 10-meter platform gold, the first American to win the event since 1964. She faced down her own fears -- an inward two-and-a-half somersault that has spooked her -- and a formidable pair of Chinese divers, who were expected to top the competition.</p>
        <p>Wilkinson, a 22-year-old Texan, finished 1.74 points ahead of the favorite, Li Na, who ended up with silver. Anne Montminy, a Canadian, won the bronze medal, edging out Li's diving partner, Sang Xue.</p>
        <p>''We had a lot of trials and tribulations to get here,'' said Wilkinson, recounting the painful weeks of rehabilitation that followed her injury. ''The day I broke my foot, I thought my dreams were over. But God works in mysterious ways.''</p>
        <p>Prodded by her coach, Ken Armstrong, Wilkinson embarked on a brutal training regime that included standing in a cast for six hours a day on top of the platform to practice her push-offs. As soon as the cast was removed, Wilkinson began practicing dives underwater, to avoid putting pressure on her foot.</p>
        <p>Through it all, Armstrong said Wilkinson demonstrated a stoicism and determination that confounded him.</p>
        <p>''She is so mellow and so in control of her feelings,'' Armstrong said. ''I have never seen her rattled.''</p>
        <p>Those traits were on display today, as Wilkinson battled back from a 60-point deficit after the semifinals. The turning point came in the third dive of the final round, a reverse two-and-a-half somersault, which Wilkinson performed perfectly, entering the water knife straight with barely a ripple.</p>
        <p>The 16-year-old Li, by contrast, struggled on her third dive, after having given a diving clinic for most of the competition. Sang fell apart on an inward three-and-a-half somersault, dropping out of medal contention. Also hurt in that round were Montminy, who had briefly challenged Li for the top spot, and her Canadian teammate Emilie Heymans.</p>
        <p>But while Wilkinson's third dive was one of her strongest, the fourth dive had plagued her in previous rounds. It puts pressure on the bones in her foot that were broken. And she had not been able to banish fears of hitting her head on the concrete tower on this particular dive; in earlier rounds, Wilkinson bungled it twice.</p>
        <p>Before Wilkinson walked to the ladder, Armstrong took her aside and urged her to dive for her friend and teammate Hilary Grivich, who was killed in a car accident in 1998. He had never invoked Grivich's name before.</p>
        <p>''She needed a boost,'' Armstrong said. ''That's a tough dive.''</p>
        <p>Wilkinson said she was caught totally off guard. But she said the comment cleared her head and inspired her to nail the dive.</p>
        <p>Wilkinson's improbable victory was a devastating defeat for the Chinese, who have built a dynasty in women's diving in the last decade. Li made few excuses.</p>
        <p>''Basically, I feel very regretful that I didn't win the gold medal,'' she said. ''I didn't dive well. That's all.''</p>
        <p>In fact, both Li and Sang, 15, dived impeccably until halfway through the final round. The judges scored their dives consistently above 8.5 during the preliminary round and the semifinals. Even Li's last effort, a forward three-and-a-half somersault, showed her trademark style,  barely rippling the surface.</p>
        <p>The trouble is, Wilkinson also nailed her final dive, a back two-and-a-half somersault with a half twist, making it impossible for Li to catch her.</p>
        <p>Li's defeat may raise questions about the Chinese team's decision to shift its champion diver, Fu Mingxia, who won a gold medal in the 10-meter competition in 1992, from the platform to the springboard.</p>
        <p>Despite her regret, Li said she was looking ahead to the synchronized diving competition, in which she will compete with Sang. Based on their performance today, the two must be considered favorites.</p>
        <p>Wilkinson faces a trip home to The Woodlands, Tex., and the prospect of having the bones in her foot rebroken to set them properly. For all that, Armstrong said, she had never complained about her injury.</p>
        <p>Indeed, he said the seeds of Wilkinson's heroics may have been planted by the injury. After she won a gold medal in the 1998 Goodwill Games in New York, Armstrong said, her intensity ebbed somewhat. But after the injury, Wilkinson found new reserves of grit that Armstrong had not seen before.</p>
        <p>The coach did his part. He recalled waking her up at 6 o'clock the morning after her injury to tell her that she was not going to quit, that she would make the Olympic team. After rubbing her eyes, Wilkinson agreed.</p>
        <p>''This year, our goal was not just to make the Olympic team, but to win a medal, and not just a medal, but a gold one,'' she said serenely.</p>
