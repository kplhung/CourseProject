        <p>In their home in Yellow Springs, Ohio, Will Lapedes and his parents were negotiating a conflict over electronic turf. Will, 14, wanted a computer in his room. For his parents, this raised a red flag. ''We wanted to be able to see the screen,'' his mother, Maureen Lynch, said. So they compromised, putting the machine in the hallway outside his room. From this roost, he chats online, looks at sports Web sites and plays an array of video games. Most of them, he said, are ''pretty gory.''</p>
        <p>As members of the Senate Commerce Committee prepare for Round 2 on Wednesday in the debate over violent entertainment, they may want to peek over the shoulders of children like Will. Well spoken and polite, he described a game called Team Fortress Classic, which he plays online. ''There are ways to make it very funny and gory,'' he said approvingly. ''When you kill somebody, it makes 25 times as many body parts fly.'' His parents used to talk to him about the carnage on-screen, he said, but now they rarely say anything.</p>
        <p>''I don't love it,'' Ms. Lynch said. ''But if we said he couldn't, he would go to a friend's house and play them.'' Like many children who play grisly video games, Will seems able to leave his aggression on the screen. He plays such games, he said, ''because I like it. What more reason do I need?'' Keeping the computer in the open at least lets his parents see what he is up to.</p>
        <p>In homes across the country, this has become the private front of the culture war. In Washington, the debate has focused on violent films, recordings and electronic games and how they are marketed. But some childhood development experts contend that the issue is not just what children see but how and where they see it. Private household choices -- where to put the family computer or video game console, how many television sets a household has -- can greatly affect the impact these entertainments have.</p>
        <p>As more of the machines find their way into children's rooms, ''the whole pattern of use of mass media works to isolate children from adults,'' said William Damon, director of the Stanford University Center on Adolescence.</p>
        <p>Even where the programming is benign, the array of video games, televisions, computers, DVD's and music systems creates a virtual world where adults often fear to tread. ''Parents don't feel they have access to their children's electronic worlds,'' Dr. Damon said. ''In lots and lots of ways, parents have stepped back from believing kids need their guidance, including a 'no.' ''</p>
        <p>As recently as a few decades ago, most children did not have their own bedrooms, let alone the electronic isolation available to today's teenagers. Among children ages 8 to 18, according to ''Kids and Media at the New Millennium,'' a 1999 survey by the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation, 65 percent have TV's in their bedrooms, 45 percent have video game players, and 21 percent have computers there. Though televisions in children's rooms may seem commonplace, their takeover has been sweeping. In 1970, only 6 percent of sixth graders had sets in their rooms; by last year, the figure had risen to 77 percent.</p>
        <p>In a family room in Jersey City last weekend, Jamie Niskanen-Singer, 12, loaded a Nintendo 64 game called Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, which is rated ''Mature 17+. Animated Blood and Gore. Animated Violence.'' His father, Howard Singer, watched as Jamie used the ''cerebral bore'' gun to rip a character's head open. Jamie said the action helped him relax, ''because I have control of what's going on,'' unlike with television. His father, apparently getting his first taste of Turok, conceded, ''It is a little violent, but we think he can differentiate between a game and real life.''</p>
        <p>This separation in the home contributes to a ''fracturing of family life,'' said John Murray, a professor of developmental psychology at Kansas State University, who studies the impact of television violence on children. Parents can have more influence than they think, Dr. Murray said. Informed parents can urge their children to question the motives of the companies selling the violence, or the ways it stimulates young nervous systems.</p>
        <p>''You can say, 'Do you feel a jolt when you kill 10 people?' '' in a video game, Dr. Murray suggested. ''Or discuss whether a program is demeaning to women.'' But parents can only do this, he stressed, if they know what is on the screen.</p>
        <p>Alison Warren, 14, feels the push and pull between privacy and isolation in this new terrain. In her home in Brookville, an affluent community on Long Island, she and her brothers, 11 and 9, share three computers in the playroom. Alison uses the computer to visit fashion and music sites, and to send instant messages to her friends. ''Sometimes my mom will be behind me and I'll be like, 'Are you lost?' '' Alison said. ''There's nothing really I have to hide. I just don't like people looking over my shoulder.''</p>
        <p>The Warren family connects to the Internet through America Online, the nation's biggest service provider. It  allows parents to give children private passwords and mailboxes but still set limits on where each can go. Alison is on a setting called ''general,'' or unrestricted, but her parents have sometimes busted her down to ''mature teen,'' which prevents access to explicitly mature newsgroups or Web sites, as punishment for ''having an attitude, which I so commonly do,'' she said, or for not cleaning her room.</p>
        <p>A ''substantial majority'' of America Online's 24 million subscribers use some parental controls, said Tricia Primrose, a company spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>When Alison was 13, her parents once found her in a chat area. ''She covered the screen when we walked by,'' said Michelle Warren, who is a stay-at-home mother. ''She was telling someone, 'I have green eyes and I'm wearing a towel.' '' Ms. Warren added, ''I got her off that pretty quick.'' Now Alison is not allowed to enter chat areas, and an AOL feature automatically shuts the account down after 11 p.m.</p>
        <p>Ms. Warren does not know her children's passwords. ''I think they should have their privacy,'' she said. But she sometimes checks the computers' history files, which automatically record the last 25 Web addresses visited by the AOL browser (other browsers leave complete history trails).</p>
        <p>The privacy question can also lead to games of cat and mouse between parents and their children. In his apartment on the Lower East Side of New York City, Javier Ortega, 16, fired up the family computer and scanned the hard drive. For the sake of a reporter, he was going to go online ''invisibly,'' with a program he got from a friend that masks the user's identity and leaves no history. He got the program, he said, so sites could not target him for junk e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>Such programs, which are easily downloaded from a number of sites, have been around as long as the World Wide Web. ''But kids using the programs is something new,'' said Parry Aftab, a lawyer who specializes in issues of child safety and the Internet.</p>
        <p>As he searched the computer's directories, Javier could not find the program. His mother, Luz Montero, who is studying programming, was not surprised. ''I deleted that program,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In truth, Javier said he was more annoyed than lured by the culture's dark side. ''Even movies that don't need violence have it,'' he complained. He mentioned a brutal game called Redneck, in which a severed foot is used as a weapon. ''Why?'' he asked. ''We've come so far as a society, but we go back to that.''</p>
        <p>The proliferation of electronic entertainments converges with other trends that isolate children from adults. Bigger houses, smaller yards, longer commutes and the rise of big regional high schools all limit the opportunities for generations to mix, said Dr. Damon of Stanford.</p>
        <p>Community planners similarly build playgrounds, but ignore the need for public spaces where older children can play in the presence of grown-ups, said William Morrish, director of the Design Center for the American Urban Landscape and professor of urban design at the University of Minnesota.</p>
        <p>In her home in Flatbush, in Brooklyn, Marya Grupsmith, 15, and her family test the limits of communal entertainment. Most evenings, Marya, her brother, Evan, 12, and their parents all flop down in the upstairs living room, each tapping on a laptop computer.</p>
        <p>Typically, Marya is trading instant messages with four friends from out of town, ''and Evan is blowing things up and dominating small countries on the computer,'' said their mother, Roberta Newman. Marya does not play violent games but does enjoy R-rated movies like ''American Psycho.'' She said the Internet gets a bad rap. ''People focused on the kids in Columbine using violent video games,'' she said. ''They should have focused more on the guns in the rooms, and the disturbed behavior.''</p>
        <p>Though her daughter might spend hours online, Ms. Newman said she did not feel out of the picture. ''We hang around a lot more together, because she doesn't need privacy, like she would on the phone,'' Ms. Newman said.</p>
        <p>This arrangement, of course, requires some resources. It is inaccessible for women like Joselyn Fernandez, who is raising two sons while working at night and going to nursing classes by day. Her older son, Brian Garcia, 14, said he rarely uses the computer in the library, ''because it is too crowded.'' Instead, he often immerses himself in a cocoon of high-carnage video games and rap music in the bedroom he shares with his brother and grandfather. He takes pride in figuring out a new game without reading the instructions. ''That's a little skill,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fernandez is troubled by the violence in her son's entertainments, she said, but more by the world outside her West Harlem door. The drug dealers, she said, do not bother her or her family. ''But the cops will throw someone against a wall, they don't care that there's children around, watching,'' she said. ''Someday it might be my son.''</p>
        <p>But on weekends, she said, Brian's friends crowd into his room to play games on his Dreamcast player. Sometimes they come too early, shattering her one morning of rest. They play a sports game or an action game, yelling and laughing above the mayhem. In the family commotion, they find connection, leaving the problems of the streets -- and the Washington debates about regulating media violence -- a world away, for the moment.</p>
