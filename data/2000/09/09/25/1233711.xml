        <p>When Giants quarterback Kerry Collins dropped back to pass late in the second quarter against the Washington Redskins, he saw something rare on this cool night: an open receiver.</p>
        <p>The Giants' wideouts in this game attracted more coverage than a Keyshawn Johnson news conference. But  Amani Toomer put a nice double move on cornerback Deion Sanders, and there was nothing but green grass in Toomer's way. In every other game this season for New York, Collins would have floated the ball gently into Toomer's hands.</p>
        <p>This time it sailed over his head. Way over it.</p>
        <p>The Giants were lucky to trail by only 10-0 at halftime, because they were outplayed in almost every way. In particular, the Redskins' defense dominated the offense of the Giants. Washington's offense, coming into this game, was stumbling, but its defense was actually humming along just fine. The Redskins' secondary of cornerbacks Sanders, Champ Bailey and Darrell Green is among the best in football, while safeties Sam Shade and Mark Carrier are experienced veterans. Washington's defense is ranked sixth over all.</p>
        <p>Collins was the main victim of the defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes and his schemes. So was the play calling. The aggressive calls of the coordinator Sean Payton, the confidence of the offense, the calmness of Collins. All gone. There was no thunder and lightning. Not a cumulus cloud in the sky.</p>
        <p>Giants receivers in the team's previous three games were always open. They don't have a lot of speed, but Ike Hilliard and Toomer have enough to beat the average cornerback, and good moves to separate themselves from the ones who have a little burst.</p>
        <p>The Redskins have corners with sprinter speed, and they can cover. Sanders and Bailey, and Green off the bench, took away the deep and outside routes, leaving just the shallow, underneath lanes. With Collins getting pressured on almost every snap, many times he didn't have enough comfort in the pocket to complete a simple short throw.</p>
        <p>The 16-6 loss to Washington exposed the Giants' offense in some ways. Against top defenses, an offense needs a game-breaking receiver. Both of the Giants' receivers are good, just not great, and that hurt New York. Ron Dixon has that scary speed, but as a rookie, he's still learning the game.</p>
        <p>And this was not one of Collins's better days. Coming into this game, Collins was one of the hottest throwers in football. He completed 68.4 percent of his passes against Arizona, 72.4 percent against Philadelphia, and 72.7 percent against Chicago. Collins is only the second quarterback in the Giants' 76-year history to complete two-thirds of his passes in three consecutive games.</p>
        <p>The other was Phil Simms in 1990, and that season the team won the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>The easygoing, calm Collins in those first three games was gone. He was indeed feeling pressure from the Redskins, but there were several plays where Collins had time, and his accuracy was still gone. Entering the fourth quarter Collins had completed just eight passes.</p>
        <p>The criticism of Collins before he signed with the Giants was that in the big games, he takes a step back. Collins is still a franchise player, a great signing by the team, but if the Giants are to advance deep into the postseason, Collins must understand that many times the game will come down to him.</p>
        <p>He must embrace that thinking, want the ball in his hands, make the tough throws, or the Giants will always lose to the top teams.</p>
        <p>An interception in the fourth quarter was typical of Collins's night. He had Toomer open -- briefly -- in the Giants' end zone. The pass was thrown a bit late and Sanders stepped in front of it, intercepting it, and ending any chance New York had of coming back.</p>
        <p>The tough part of this loss is that Washington proved wrong what many in the National Football League had thought until last night: that the Giants were the class of the division.</p>
        <p>They could still be. Maybe it was just an off night for New York. The Redskins were desperate, and played like it, while the Giants were a little giddy all week.</p>
        <p>Coach Jim Fassel won't burn the game film. It's too valuable to use as a teaching tool. His message: See, we're not as good as everyone has been saying.</p>
        <p>Collins made some nice throws at the end of the game, including a 7-yard touchdown pass to Hilliard, and running back Tiki Barber played hard and was often the only offense the team had, rushing for 65 yards.</p>
        <p>But the Giants still have got to be a little nervous. To go from dominating teams to this ugly moment will raise some doubt in the locker room. Were we that good against the Cardinals, Eagles and Bears? Or did we just beat up on some poor teams? Will we struggle against the good ones like Washington?</p>
        <p>New York will get some answers in the next few weeks, traveling to Tennessee and then to Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Collins, and the rest of the offense, will be watched carefully.</p>
        <p>And they know it.</p>
