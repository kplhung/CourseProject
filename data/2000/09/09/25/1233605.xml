        <p>Evan Greenberg, who until his resignation last week had been in line to take charge of the American International Group, the powerful insurance company led by his father, Maurice R. Greenberg, is not rushing to find a new job.</p>
        <p>But when he decides to make a move, several executive headhunters said last week, he is likely to have an abundance of choices.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people will want to talk to him,'' said Robert R. Stone, a partner in the recently formed executive search firm Ceannas Inc., who has been in the business 20 years.</p>
        <p>Evan Greenberg, 45, may have received mixed reviews in the last few years as he worked as an understudy to his acclaimed father, the chairman and chief executive of A.I.G., and somewhat in the shadow of his brother, Jeffrey, 48, who left A.I.G. in 1995 and became chief executive of Marsh &amp; McLennan, the world's largest insurance brokerage firm.</p>
        <p>But out on his own, the experts say, Evan is likely to be a hot commodity.</p>
        <p>''He's had a tremendous set of experiences at an incredibly high-performing company,'' said Francis J. Lattanzio, another partner at Ceannas. ''If you're going to compare him to Michael Jordan,'' Mr. Lattanzio said, referring to Evan's superstar father, ''everyone is going to fall short.''</p>
        <p>For Evan, this is a time for reflection, for standing back after 25 years in insurance and thinking about whether the next 25 years will be in insurance or some other aspect of financial services or perhaps something entirely different. ''I'm going to weigh things carefully,'' he said in a brief conversation.</p>
        <p>A.I.G. says that instead of immediately picking a replacement, it expects to parcel out his responsibilities to several other executives. Alice Schroeder, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said that the company is likely to consider insiders as well as executives throughout the industry, including some A.I.G. alumni, as the new leader.</p>
        <p>Evan Greenberg, who had been president and chief operating officer,  gave up his claim on one of the most prestigious jobs in insurance last Monday, just nine months after his father formally designated him as his successor.</p>
        <p>He has been unwilling to speak in detail about what prompted him to resign, and his father, who is 75, has been equally unwilling to shed any light on the situation.</p>
        <p>''It was time for a change,'' Evan said at one point. ''We're going to have to leave it at that.''</p>
        <p>People who have followed the company for years say the senior Mr. Greenberg, who sets an exhausting pace, always expected even more from his sons than from others.  Moreover, even though Evan was the heir apparent, it was not apparent  that the top job would be available any time soon -- while he was still relatively young. His father is still trim enough to fit into the army uniform he wore as an officer in Europe and Korea; he's still a killer on the tennis court and still gleefully insists he has no plans to do anything other than keep running the nation's most successful insurer.</p>
        <p>''In my opinion, Evan wanted to have more responsibility sooner than Hank was willing to relinquish it,'' said M. Evan Lindsay, a partner who specializes in insurance at Heidrick &amp; Struggles International, one of the biggest executive search firms.</p>
        <p>Precisely because he was being groomed to replace his father, or, in the early days, at least to take some high position, Evan has had an unusually wide range of experience. Rather than becoming a specialist in life insurance, say, or property casualty, or investments, as is more typical, he has had a chance to work in all those areas.</p>
        <p>He has had several jobs dealing with life insurance and was responsible for both life and property casualty insurance when he was in charge of A.I.G.'s businesses in Japan and Korea. He has headed the company's lucrative international commercial insurance division. And among his latest duties was oversight of commercial coverage in the United States, as well as automobile and life insurance. He has also been heavily involved in technology.</p>
        <p>The fact that Evan, who became a master of insurance without benefit of a college degree, had been his father's designated hitter made it difficult for outsiders to evaluate his performance. ''People weren't sure whether he got there entirely on the merits,'' Mr. Lindsay said. Now, whatever job he lands, the hiring and due diligence will be at arm's length.</p>
        <p>At first glance there are not a lot of great job openings in the upper strata of the insurance business or elsewhere in financial services. But, Mr. Lattanzio said, it is not just a matter of what jobs are visible right now.</p>
        <p>''It's not unlike a high-profile athlete becoming a free agent,'' he said. ''You can't just look at the existing openings. A lot of things could develop.''</p>
