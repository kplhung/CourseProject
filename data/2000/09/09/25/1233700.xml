        <p>The play had been a certified flop for the Jets in practice last week, but Curtis Martin, who makes his living running the football, promised his passing would improve in today's game. And it did.</p>
        <p>With less than a minute to play and the Jets trailing Tampa Bay, 17-14, Martin took a handoff from Vinny Testaverde, just as he had on the previous play. Except this time he lofted a pass to wide receiver Wayne Chrebet, who was wide open in the end zone.</p>
        <p>Chrebet admittedly jumped too soon as the ball headed toward him, but he snagged the football to give the Jets a dramatic 21-17 victory.</p>
        <p>Never mind that Martin hadn't thrown a pass in a game in a decade -- since high school. Or that Chrebet, put down continually by the former Jets receiver Keyshawn Johnson, had just one catch in the game to that point.</p>
        <p>''They actually laughed at me,'' Martin said of his practice attempts as a passer. ''That play was the joke of the week in practice. The first time we ran it, I rolled out and threw it and it just wobbled. Everybody went, 'Quack, quack, quack.' But I told 'em: 'You all just wait for the game. I'll get it done in the game.' ''</p>
        <p>Martin had gained 6 yards with a  handoff on a play from the Bucs' 24-yard line.</p>
        <p>''The obvious thing is we're going to run that toss again,'' center Kevin Mawae said. ''They bit for it big.''</p>
        <p>Martin said he never saw Chrebet catch the ball. ''That was the hardest hit I took all day,'' he said, referring to the Bucs' pass rush on the play.</p>
        <p>Chrebet lined up for the play remembering how shaky Martin had looked in practice, but also thinking this was the perfect time to catch the Bucs off guard.</p>
        <p>''He hadn't thrown well, but I had told him, 'Man, just throw it out there,' '' Chrebet said. ''And he hit me in the mouth with it.''</p>
        <p>The reserve running back Bernie Parmalee said the Jets ran the play at least 10 times at practice one day, and Martin looked like, well, a running back. The Jets' offensive coordinator, Dan Henning, told a different story.</p>
        <p>''He was 2 for 2 with it in practice,'' Henning said. ''But he didn't throw as pretty a pass as he did today.''</p>
        <p>Henning said it took no guts to call the play. ''I just asked Al and he said, 'Go with it,' '' he said of Coach Al Groh.</p>
        <p>Chrebet noted that he was so eager to make the catch that he jumped before the ball got there. ''Fortunately, I was able to hang in the air for a while,'' he said, smiling. ''I wasn't going to miss that ball if there was any way possible.'' The catch gave Chrebet a big last laugh against Johnson, who during the week had described Chrebet as a mere flashlight compared with his own status as a full-scale star.</p>
        <p>''On that catch, there were a lot of flashbulbs going off, and they were for one guy,'' Mawae said. ''I want to be humble about this, but it's hard. I'm just thrilled to death.''</p>
        <p>Chrebet didn't want to participate in any gloating as far as Johnson was concerned.</p>
        <p>''Sweet? Redemption? None of that means anything to me,'' Chrebet said. ''The whole thing is the Jets are 4-0 and that's the story.''</p>
        <p>Until the frantic finish -- set up by two fumble recoveries -- the Jets' offense had been held in check by Tampa Bay. The Bucs' defense intercepted Testaverde three times, including a 37-yard touchdown return by cornerback Ronde Barber. With 10 minutes 1 second left in the game, Groh replaced Testaverde with Ray Lucas, but only for a series.</p>
        <p>''A lot of things weren't working today,'' Chrebet said. ''But the thing is, you don't stop trying. If you keep plugging away, good things are going to happen. I believe that, and I think that was evident on that last catch.''</p>
        <p>In his postgame interviews, Chrebet grew weary of hearing Johnson's name.</p>
        <p>''I could say things and point fingers, but I'm bigger than that,'' he said. ''I play for the New York Jets, and that's all Wayne Chrebet cares about.''</p>
