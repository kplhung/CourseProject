        <p>WELCOME, Mia, Brandi and Julie, to the Summer Olympics, or at least that part of it where Other Athletes roam. Have a good time when you get to Sydney. Get some dinner with a harbor view. Reacquaint yourselves with some of the people you marched with in the opening ceremony.</p>
        <p>Go see Marion Jones do her thing.</p>
        <p>''Being outside of Sydney has been a blessing in disguise,'' Coach April Heinrichs said after her team's shaky 1-0 semifinal victory over Brazil. ''For us, the focus has been on our team and keeping the distractions to a minimum.''</p>
        <p>That's great, when you're playing in some isolated outpost, or even in Pasadena, in the final of the World Cup. But these are the Olympics, supposedly more than just another tournament. It's not their fault, having been sent far away from the Olympic hub, just as they were four years ago. But from the looks of yesterday's messy yellow-card festival from which the referee had to flee the angry Brazilians, all these women would be wise to lobby for a prime in-town location and a more contextual experience four years from now.</p>
        <p>''See, we're spoiled again,'' Tiffeny Milbrett said upon learning the Americans would not be bunking in the athletes' village upon their arrival in Sydney, where the final will be played.</p>
        <p>Anyone tempted to make a Dream Team case out of this shouldn't bother. After two weeks in various soccer outposts, it would be unfair to expect the Americans to plop themselves in the middle of the village so close to Thursday's gold medal game against Norway, which edged Germany yesterday. Those teams were already in Sydney, as opposed to the higher elevation of this Australian capital, where the weather was raw and the reception from the local fans was cold.</p>
        <p>''Like Americans, Australians always root for the underdog,'' Heinrichs said.</p>
        <p>That's part of it, but it's also become increasingly clear that the Aussies don't relate to the Americans' belief that they are typically supposed to win. From swimming to softball to soccer, among other popular sites, the sense here has been that Americans failing is almost as appealing as Australians winning.</p>
        <p>It didn't help that Mia Hamm scored the only goal yesterday after the Brazilian goalie, Andreia, fell in a collision with Milbrett, who merely jumped for a ball headed in front of the net by Lorrie Fair. Then the United States really irked the Aussie fans with their ''four corners'' offense in the game's closing minutes. The stall worked, but the fans reacted as if the World Cup and defending gold medalists from Atlanta -- actually, from Athens, Ga. -- should have been above such a tactic.</p>
        <p>It was another example of legend obscuring reality, as if the previous Olympics and the World Cup were won without significant challenge, without close calls that would have killed many a magazine cover, not to mention a run on a certain brand of sports bra. Heinrichs knows all too well that against the handful of top teams, ''it's a matter of inches, out of your control.''</p>
        <p>But because of how this particular team has been hyped and what it has come to represent -- ''every young girl who signed up to play,'' Brandi Chastain said -- its collective and individual performances must now get critiqued, as if the outcome of a game were based on technical merit.</p>
        <p>''This wasn't our best soccer today,'' Heinrichs finally admitted, after conducting an impromptu team meeting on the field to remind her players that, at this stage of the game, success is whatever gets you to Sydney.</p>
        <p>The Americans were outplayed, and not by a little, but the Brazilians insisted on playing Hamm physically, knocking her down four times, three of which earned yellow cards. Why a finesse team that had ball-handling advantages all over the field would want to arouse a more physical opponent by targeting its star is a mystery. For its troubles, Brazil saw the only goal score as a result of a foul against Hamm in the 60th minute, while one of its best players, Katia, wound up carried off on a stretcher after pulling up lame as the game began to devolve.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, after slogging around ineffectually, Chastain set up the goal with her well-placed free kick, and Hamm was in the right place to left-foot the ball across the goal mouth and into the right corner. Maybe all the United States has left on these other teams -- particularly Brazil -- is the ability to adapt to game conditions, make the big play, like the lunging hand save Siri Mullinix came up with on a close-in, right-angle shot by Brazil's Roselli, point-blank range, in the second half.</p>
        <p>It was one of those balls you react to on instinct, like the penalty kicks the American men played when they won their quarterfinal for their own trip to Sydney.</p>
        <p>The women were awaiting a score from that game Saturday night, when word came of the shootout. Soon a call was made, and they were huddled around a cell phone, receiving play-by-play, live.</p>
        <p>Mullinix, who wasn't in Atlanta or Pasadena, said she wished she could have seen it as well. In Sydney, at the real Olympics, she will.</p>
