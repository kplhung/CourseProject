        <p>Re ''Dueling Scholars Join Fray Over a Constitutional Challenge to Gun Control Laws'' (news article, Sept. 21):</p>
        <p>A pro-gun-control professor organized a law-review symposium promoting his view of the Second Amendment, and the event seems to have come up with little more than a statement by Jack Rakove of Stanford University that I (along with several other scholars) misinterpreted a letter by James Madison as endorsing the individual right to bear arms.</p>
        <p>Professor Rakove can debate this letter of Madison's as much as it pleases him, but in fact the framers' public statements in support of gun ownership are numerous and well documented. The mountain has labored and brought forth a mouse.</p>

        <p>The writer is a professor of law at the University of Tennessee.</p>
