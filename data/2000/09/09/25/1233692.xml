        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Rich? No, Frugal,'' by Stanley Herz (Op-Ed, Sept. 21): It's the sad truth that plain-living people like Mr. Herz's in-laws fall within the 2 percent of Americans that President Clinton classifies as the ''very rich'' and who therefore do not merit the tax relief that repeal of the federal estate tax would mean.</p>
        <p>That 2 percent figure is meaningless anyway. There is no reliable method of estimating the number of living Americans who will die millionaires because there is no way to estimate how many 401(k) accounts are worth in the neighborhood of a million dollars until the owners either die or reach the age at which they must begin making taxable withdrawals. It's just as impossible to estimate the ''at death'' value of American taxpayers' real estate purchased years ago, until there's a taxable event like a sale or the owner's death.</p>

        <p>This is why so many unlikely ''wealthiest Americans'' -- and their heirs, like Mr. Herz -- are increasingly outraged about the death tax.</p>
