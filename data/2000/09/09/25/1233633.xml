        <p>Motorola Inc. and Palm Inc. plan to announce today that they will collaborate on a new portable phone that would put the features of a Palm hand-held computer into a device closer to the size and shape of a cell phone.</p>
        <p>The companies said they had signed an agreement to use Motorola's wireless technologies, product line and distributors and Palm's core hand-held software technology. The effort is an extension of an agreement in December 1999 under which Motorola took a minority stake in Palm.</p>
        <p>This deal, coming after a similar agreement last year between Palm and Nokia, could be a blow to Symbian, a consortium set up by Ericsson, Psion, Nokia and Matsushita Electric Industrial. Symbian has created a standard operating system, called EPOC, for wireless devices. In addition to Palm OS, the competition for Symbian also includes the Microsoft Windows CE operating system for mobile devices.</p>
        <p>Mike Zafirovski, president of the Motorola PCS division, said the company had been working with its own operating system, as well as Palm and Symbian, and planned to continue all three efforts.</p>
        <p>''Obviously a number of companies are working with various devices,'' he said. ''We're absolutely convinced that putting our two companies together will produce the right product for the first quarter of 2002.''</p>
        <p>The Palm arrangement with Motorola differs from those it has with Nokia, Qualcomm and Kyocera, which are straight licensing agreements.</p>
        <p>''What makes Motorola unique is it's jointly branded, and we're working closely together,'' said Alan Kessler, Palm's chief operating officer for products and platforms.</p>
        <p>The first product of the collaboration is to be a G.S.M. wireless phone, expected to be available early in 2002, which will initially be distributed through the existing Motorola sales channels.  G.S.M. is the cell phone standard commonly in use in Europe and Asia, and the use of it is beginning to expand in the United States.</p>
        <p>Combining technologies from both companies, the device will contain a larger color screen than standard mobile phones and will  include Palm's HotSync software and over-the-air synchronization using the Starfish TrueSync software from Motorola. Synchronization allows the hand-held device to keep up to date with information on the user's desktop computer. Mr. Zafirovski said the device would be larger than the smallest cell phones, but smaller than a typical Palm device.</p>
        <p>Prices have not been set yet.</p>
