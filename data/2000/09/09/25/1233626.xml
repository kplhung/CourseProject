        <p>The dramatic pause before the final score was posted lasted long enough for Svetlana Khorkina to launch into a plea-bargaining session with her demons.</p>
        <p>She clamped her eyes shut, clenched her fists as tight as paper wads and whispered under her breath: please, no more heartbreak. An instant later, as the impressive Ling Jie's score of 9.837 glowed on the overhead screen, Khorkina's naturally sullen exterior melted away.</p>
        <p>Joy moved in. With tiny puddles in her eyes, the willowy Russian floated over to the uneven bars and kissed them like an old friend. By the smallest of margins, by the minuscule hop on Ling's dismount, Khorkina's 9.862 in her signature event was enough to give her a gold medal in today's Olympic apparatus finals at the Super Dome. It also provided her with an ounce of redemption after an error by the technical staff ruined her chance at the prestigious all-around title last Thursday.</p>
        <p>That night, after springing into her vault, and abruptly crashing like a bird flying into a windowpane, the diva of gymnastics was too emotionally distraught to hit her next routine, the uneven bars. One event later, she was told the vault block had been mistakenly set two inches below standard height. In an array of reactions, Khorkina cried, screamed and eventually exited the arena in a huff.</p>
        <p>''If I didn't get over the disappointment, I wouldn't be Khorkina,'' she said through an interpreter today. ''I wouldn't be standing here with the gold medal.</p>
        <p>''It still hurts a lot. It was cruel to all the participants, to vault on a nonstandard height. It's quite possible to get killed. The five centimeters could decide the future of a sports person. But I was fortunate to have many people to help me get through it.''</p>
        <p>Khorkina found comfort from the dozens of flower arrangements sent to the Olympic Village by fans; she was delighted by a visit with her little sister just before today's competition and enjoyed a mind-cleansing afternoon in the city on Friday. Surrounded by friends, she visited the Sydney Aquarium, went to a salon for a manicure and had her cropped blonde hair sheared away.</p>
        <p>Somehow, in her innocent new haircut, with the long-awaited smile that appeared today, the hard edge to the Khorkina persona softened. Fitting the spirit of her makeover, Khorkina was giving to the Russian teammates who often appear to be her wait staff. Today, she handed over a chance to grab a gold medal to Yelena Zamolodtchikova.</p>
        <p>Long before the Thursday debacle, Khorkina qualified to compete in the vault apparatus final. But an hour before today's competition, Khorkina, haunted by her last experience and feeling soreness in her knee, decided to bow out. She handed her spot in the vault final to the Russian next in line, Zamolodtchikova.</p>
        <p>''I thought she could win the gold,'' Khorkina said. ''I'm glad I could give her that opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Zamolodtchikova embraced the moment. On little notice, she gathered her focus and came through with a 9.731 to grab the gold medal.</p>
        <p>''So happy,'' she said. ''Just so happy.''</p>
        <p>It was a satisfying day for the Russians, who finished with consolation medals in the team finals. Beyond the success of Khorkina and Zamolodtchikova, Aleksei Nemov picked up a silver in the floor exercise and a bronze on the pommel horse, adding to the all-around gold medal he won on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>Next to Nemov on the medal podium, Igors Vihrovs, of Latvia, won the gold in the floor exercise and Romania's Marius Urzica took the gold on the pommel horse. Flaunting his strength on the still rings, Hungary's Szilveszter Csollany leaped in delight after a 9.850 gave him the gold medal.</p>
        <p>''I still cannot comprehend how beautiful this day is,'' Csollany said.</p>
        <p>But the Russians were the captivating figures. Even as a runner-up, the personable Nemov played to the crowd, throwing his medal-ceremony bouquet into the seats. A half-hour later, Khorkina followed his lead, tossing her flowers with even more vigor. As she exited the arena, she winked at the fans, blew them kisses and left a different impression of herself. Beneath her famed petulance, Khorkina knew how to express her lighter side.</p>
        <p>''Tomorrow, I will dance for Russia,'' Khorkina said, referring to the women's floor exercise, which is scheduled for Part 2 of the apparatus finals on Monday. ''I will leave what happened on the vault far behind me, like the North Pole.''</p>
