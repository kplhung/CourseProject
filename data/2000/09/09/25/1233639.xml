        <p>Javier Sotomayor was standing nearby, preparing to walk back into the wet and windy Olympic Stadium to receive his silver medal in the men's high jump, when Stefan Holm made it clear that he did not believe Sotomayor should have been competing in these Olympic Games at all.</p>
        <p>''He shouldn't be here; it should have been my medal,'' said Holm, a Swede who finished fourth. Surprisingly, the event was won by Sergei Kliugin of Russia.</p>
        <p>The 32-year-old Sotomayor was the 1992 Olympic champion and still holds the world record of 2.45 meters (8 feet  1/2 inch), set in 1993. He is the most consistently brilliant jumper in the history of the sport, but at last year's Pan American Games he tested positive for cocaine. Sotomayor denied ever using cocaine, and despite being cleared by the Cuban federation, a two-year ban against him was upheld this past June. Yet in August, his suspension was cut in half and he was allowed to compete in Sydney.</p>
        <p>As today's weather conditions worsened, Sotomayor cleared 2.32 meters (7-7 1/4) but failed three times to match Kliugin's winning jump of 2.35 meters (7-8 1/2). Abderrahmane Hammad of Algeria won the bronze, becoming the first African medalist in the men's high jump.</p>
        <p>Even though Hammad, Holm and three others cleared 2.32 meters, Sotomayor won the silver because he cleared 2.25 meters and then 2.32 on his first attempts. The other competitors missed at least once on their way to clearing 2.32. But if not for the rain and increasing winds, all might have jumped higher.</p>
        <p>Kliugin, a 26-year-old without a previous major title, whose personal best was 2.33 until today, cleared the winning height before the rain and wind peaked. And even though many were predicting a Russian victory in this event, the Russian expected to win was the defending world champion, Vyacheslav Voronin, whose jump of 2.40 (7-10 1/2) last month was the best in the world in five years. He was 10th today after clearing 2.29.</p>
        <p>''Basically, I believe I lucked out,'' Kliugin said.</p>
        <p>Despite Holm's sentiments, Sotomayor defended his appearance in the Games.</p>
        <p>''I didn't steal a medal from anybody,'' he said afterward. ''I've been jumping for 17 years. The international federation stole one year of my career. I don't need to take any substances to jump higher. ''</p>
        <p>I've had to put up with a lot in the last year. I'm a victim of something that didn't happen.''</p>
        <p>After Sotomayor's positive test in 1999, the Cuban federation contended that the second of his two urine samples might have been tampered with.</p>
        <p>He missed last year's world championships, and after nearly a year of legal debate and hearings, an arbitration panel from the International Amateur Athletics Federation, the sport's governing body, upheld his two-year ban on June 27, which meant that Sotomayor could not compete until July 30, 2001.</p>
        <p>That would have kept him out of these Games and potentially ended his career, but the Cuban federation continued pursuing the case, appealing to the I.A.A.F. and citing a clause in the federation rule book that permits drug bans to be modified if there are ''exceptional circumstances.''</p>
        <p>On Aug. 2, invoking that clause and citing the hundreds of drug tests Sotomayor had passed during his long and exceptional career, an I.A.A.F. council cut Sotomayor's penalty in half and made him eligible to compete immediately.</p>
        <p>Arne Ljunqvist of Sweden, a council member and I.A.A.F. medical commission chairman, disassociated himself from the move. As Ljunqvist watched the competition, that a fellow Swede had missed out on a medal because of Sotomayor was hardly lost on him.</p>
        <p>''It's something completely against the spirit behind our rules and totally against the spirit of our anti-doping work,'' Ljunqvist said tonight of the council's decision. ''If the leadership of international sport does not take correct and consistent decisions, how can we expect our athletes to understand what we are doing?''</p>
        <p>Hammad, who occasionally trains with Sotomayor in Cuba, said he did not feel he had been robbed of a silver medal, but Holm said Sotomayor's appearance was not right.</p>
        <p>''The rules say a two-year ban for cocaine,'' Holm said. ''It should be two years, not one year. The I.A.A.F. can't even follow its own decision. They kept dragging it out, and because he's a good guy and because he's done so much for the sport, they cut it to one year.''</p>
        <p>Nathan Leeper, an American who was 11th with a jump of 2.25 meters, said, ''I can think of a few other guys who have been working hard the last few years who probably deserve that silver medal a bit more if what happened to Sotomayor is true.''</p>
        <p>While Kliugin said he was fortunate to win the high jump, Denise Lewis's gold medal in the heptathlon had little to do with luck. The British star won a bronze medal in the last Olympics and silver medals in the last two world championships. Today, she took the final step, coming from behind in the last two of seven events, recording a personal best in the javelin to take a 63-point lead and then muddling through in the 800 despite ankle and foot pain to win with 6,584 points. That was 53 better than the silver medalist, Yelena Prokhorova of Russia.</p>
        <p>In the night's two other medal events, Tereza Marinova of Bulgaria won the women's triple jump with a leap of 15.20 meters (49-10 1/2) in benign weather that no one could match as conditions worsened. Szymon Ziolkowski of Poland won the men's hammer with a throw of 80.02 meters (262-6).</p>
        <p>Michael Johnson, the world record-holder and defending Olympic champion in the men's 400, advanced to the final in the chill by finishing second in his semifinal today to his teammate Alvin Harrison. Neither pushed his hardest.</p>
        <p>''I just wanted to get in the top two, so I could get a good lane in the final,'' Johnson said. ''We had to stand around in the rain for 15 minutes waiting on a medal ceremony. Fortunately, nobody got injured.''</p>
