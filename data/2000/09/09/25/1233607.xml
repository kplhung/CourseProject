        <p>The coffee table book about the Clinton administration looked innocuous enough: 227 pictures of the president clowning with staff members, smiling with his family and hob-nobbing with foreign dignitaries.</p>
        <p>But, like many illustrated books, the album, by the former White House photographer Robert McNeely, was manufactured in China, and Chinese customs officials saw it differently. Spotting one picture of President Bill Clinton chatting with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism and an icon of Tibet's cultural autonomy from China, they stopped 17,000 copies of the book at its bindery last month. To top it off, customs officials then blocked the printing of two other books from the same publisher -- an illustrated book of Tibetan Buddhist art and a book by the fashion photographer Max Vadukul. (Mr. Vadukul's book was free of Buddhism but included a little nudity.)</p>
        <p>Last week, Chinese officials apparently loosened, at least a little. They agreed to allow the White House book out of the country, said the book's publisher, Nicholas Callaway, of Callaway Editions. Chinese officials offered no explanation and never relented on the other two titles, Mr. Callaway said. But the dispute about the other books became moot because Mr. Callaway arranged to print them in Hong Kong, outside mainland Chinese customs.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong and South China have become an important center for the manufacture of illustrated books because of the region's abundance of cheap labor and reputation for high quality. China officially controls the content of everything printed in its territory, but several publishers of illustrated books could not recall any other books blocked for political or religious reasons.</p>
        <p>''I am very pleased,'' said Patricia Schroeder, president of the American Association of Publishers, adding that censorship remains a problem in the United States, too. The publishers' association and other book industry groups are holding a ceremony today at the Library of Congress to honor four people who supported the wildly popular Harry Potter books when some religious groups criticized the books for glorifying wizardry. Translations of the Harry Potter books go on sale next month for the first time in China, where the government officially discourages superstitions, and publishers await official reaction.</p>
