        <p>Rich nations claimed a breakthrough today in their battle against high oil prices after persuading several oil-producing countries to join them in calling for cheaper crude. But their intensive campaign to stabilize commodity and currency markets awaited the verdict of traders on Monday.</p>
        <p>Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Russia and the United Arab Emirates joined the Group of 7 industrialized nations and other members of the committee that governs the International Monetary Fund in condemning current oil prices as harmful. Their agreement did not constitute a binding commitment, but financial officials presented it as tangible progress before OPEC holds a meeting in Caracas, Venezuela, this week.</p>
        <p>''The committee is concerned that current oil prices, if sustained, could hamper global growth, add to inflationary pressures and adversely affect prospects for many countries,'' its communique said.</p>
        <p>Finance ministers who are gathered here for the annual meetings of the monetary fund and the World Bank hope that their sustained oratorical campaign against a $30-plus barrel price for oil will have a marked impact on a volatile commodity market that is sometimes moved by psychology and speculation.</p>
        <p>But they are financial officials, not energy ministers, and they have so far been unable to announce concrete steps that would lead to a greater supply of oil by winter. Today's communique, like one released Saturday, praised the United States decision last week to tap its substantial strategic oil reserves to help dampen prices. Though the statement noted that other nations would also consider using emergency reserves to increase supply, none had made such a commitment by today.</p>
        <p>Finance ministers once expected that their meetings would be overshadowed by anti-globalization protests. So far, those protests have proven mostly peaceful and far smaller than anticipated. But the high price of oil and the falling euro -- what the ministers have called twin threats to the global economy -- have overtaken the agenda. The big test will come Monday, when markets reopen and traders vote on whether official promises to corral prices are credible.</p>
        <p>Central bankers from the United States, Britain, Japan and Canada joined the European Central Bank on Friday in a concerted intervention to prop up the battered euro, which had fallen almost 30 percent since it went into use at the start of last year.</p>
        <p>In delicately worded statements, they have effectively promised to buy euros and sell their own currencies again if the market does not get the message. They could be dragged into defending their stance as early as Monday if the euro slumps.</p>
        <p>Nations that control the monetary fund gave Horst Kohler, the former German finance ministry official who now runs the Washington-based International Monetary Fund, the chance to present his vision for the global lending agency.</p>
        <p>The fund has come under sustained attack for practicing bad economics and imposing too much on poor nations, though the ministers gathered here are strong supporters of the fund because they see its as a bulwark against financial panic.</p>
        <p>''I have not come to the fund to turn it upside down,'' Mr. Kohler said before the meeting began. ''But there is a further need for change, and even accelerated change.''</p>
        <p>As expected, the nations that control the fund backed a plan to provide debt relief to 20 nations by the end of this year, up from 10 that have already been granted relief. The effort, intended at least in part to head off demands from protesters, requires that the monetary fund and the World Bank ease some conditions they have imposed on debt relief in the past.</p>
        <p>The nations also approved changes to the fund's lending programs intended to preserve the fund's capital for crises and wean it away from some long-term lending to more financially stable nations. The overhaul was pushed by Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers of the United States.</p>
        <p>But finance ministers did not endorse specific changes to the way the fund imposes capitalist economic and financial conditions on nations that borrow its money. Though Mr. Kohler has spoken of his vision of streamlining and even eliminating some of those conditions, the committee's communique today warned against any severing of strings attached to loans. It did back a review of the matter, however.</p>
        <p>Protesters favoring debt relief  held a mock funeral today for children they say die needlessly because their countries are so poor, attracting hundreds of people to central Prague. Organized by Jubilee 2000, a London-based umbrella group that advocates debt forgiveness, the march was significantly smaller than similar events held recently in Seattle, in Washington, D.C., and in Cologne, Germany.</p>
        <p>Other protest groups have vowed to blockade World Bank and International Monetary Fund delegates around town on Tuesday. But some organizers are worried that the number of activists arriving in Prague will fall short of the expected 20,000.</p>
        <p>Some protesters are blaming overly zealous authorities for the low turnout. The police today halted an Italian train carrying protesters at the Czech Republic's southern border and refused to let it pass until four blacklisted activists got off.</p>
        <p>Lee Sustar, an American who said he writes for a socialist newspaper in Chicago and had come to Prague to cover the demonstrations, said by telephone from the Prague airport that he had been stopped there by border authorities and refused entry. He said the police told him that he was on a blacklist given to them by American officials. He added that he had been detained during anti-globalization protests in Seattle last year.</p>
