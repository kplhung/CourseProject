        <p>Things were seldom what they seemed in ''Stowaways,'' which the Compagnie Philippe Genty presented on Tuesday night. Ambiguity contributed to the wonder of this 70-minute work, created and directed by Mr. Genty and Mary Underwood and choreographed by Ms. Underwood. Yet the relentless parade of odd effects sometimes made this attraction of the Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater seem unduly gimmicky.</p>
        <p>Mr. Genty, a French mixed-media artist, demonstrated that he was capable of amazing ingenuity as he set Fabrizio Chiodetti, Sonia Enquin, Meredith Kitchen, Abel Perraudin and Stephanie Taillandier on a grotesque journey to a taped score by Ian McDonald. Along the way they encountered odd creatures that may or may not have been alive. And the apparent people one beheld occasionally, and unexpectedly, became less than human.</p>
        <p>Because ''Stowaways'' received its premiere in Adelaide, Australia, in 1996, it was only fitting that an enormous kangaroo materialized at the start of the piece. In other scenes, human beings seemed stick figures, stick figures turned human, people were taken apart and reassembled, a short-legged woman was provided with long legs, an armless woman lost her head, a tiny house caught  fire, a lumpy doll came to life and had tantrums, an airplane flew through the sky, tortoiselike creatures crept onto a beach and the cast was swallowed up in shifting sands.</p>
        <p>The effects were astonishing. Yet the only point of many of the metamorphoses was their oddity. The characters' journey never really took them anywhere. Fortunately, the theatrical magic was always remarkable and the production's slight edge of menace prevented it from being mired in whimsy.</p>
        <p>''Stowaways'' continues through Sunday at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea.</p>
