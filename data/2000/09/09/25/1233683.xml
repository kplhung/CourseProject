        <p>Rising like a Bavarian castle on a knoll overlooking the skyscrapers downtown, the Krueger-Scott Mansion has long been one of this city's architectural jewels, a relic of the gilded age when Newark was a proud industrial powerhouse and High Street was its boulevard of nouveau-riche extravagance.</p>
        <p>The 26-room house was built by Gottfried Krueger, a German immigrant who rose from poverty to become Newark's most flamboyant beer baron. Clad in salmon sandstone, its slate roof punctuated by six chimneys and a soaring turret, it was the largest residence in town when it was completed in 1888. It was also the first in New Jersey to have an elevator.</p>
        <p>The house was later the home of Louise Scott Roundtree, a South Carolina-born former maid who had become a beauty-parlor magnate. Many believe she was the first black woman in the city to become a millionaire.</p>
        <p>While $7 million worth of work has restored the exterior, the house is a ruin inside. Years of municipal neglect and repeated looting have robbed the house of its crystal chandeliers and pearl-inlaid wainscoting. After a decade of work -- and, some say, wasteful spending -- plans to turn the house into an African-American cultural center have been frozen by the Municipal Council, which refuses to allocate any more money for a project that was originally scheduled for completion in 1993.</p>
        <p>''Looking at that place, there's no way anyone could say $7 million was spent on that building,'' said Donald Tucker, a Council member whose recent vote helped defeat a proposal that would have allowed the Newark Housing Authority to finish the job. ''It's an abysmal failure, a total waste of taxpayer money.''</p>
        <p>The Council's refusal to spend more money puts it at odds with Mayor Sharpe James, who has vowed to finish the project, at a cost of $5 million more. ''If I have to, I'm going to move into that building myself and force the city to provide me with heat, electricity and plumbing,'' he said in an interview. ''We've got to keep the legacy of Louise Scott alive.''</p>
        <p>For a city struggling to rebuild its shattered ego, the Krueger-Scott project has become an outsized symbol of Newark's faded glories, bungled opportunities, and aspirations for a more glorious future. As the home of a self-made black businesswoman, the house is also freighted with issues of race and black pride.</p>
        <p>Although Newark is enjoying a long-awaited revival, it remains one of the nation's poorest cities, one that many say can ill afford to spend millions renovating a Victorian estate. Although he wants to see the building rehabilitated, Mr. James no longer supports public financing for a historically accurate restoration. He simply wants the house brought into public use, even if that means a gut renovation or a deal with a private corporation that would get office and meeting space in return for its investment.</p>
        <p>''We are not a cash cow,'' Mr. James said. ''The citizens won't support open-ended spending.''</p>
        <p>In many ways, the fortunes and misfortunes of the Krueger-Scott Mansion mirror those of this battered city, which was one of the nation's wealthiest until the riots of 1967 and the ensuing depopulation drained Newark of its prosperity.</p>
        <p>It takes some imagination to picture the days when High Street was lined with opulent estates, each one bigger and more outlandish than the last.</p>
        <p>Now known as Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, the street has become a hodgepodge of weatherworn stately homes, empty lots and synagogues that have been recycled into churches. Next door to the Krueger-Scott Mansion is a 21-story apartment building, Hill Manor, that is awaiting demolition, part of the city's effort to replace its high-rise housing projects with town houses.</p>
        <p>In building his fantasy home, Mr. Krueger is said to have been inspired by the baroque castles of his native Baden.</p>
        <p>''People considered it the most garish thing they'd ever seen,'' said Charles F. Cummings, the city historian, who has written about High Street's genteel past. ''But he loved it. He also loved to rub people's noses in the fact that he was a penniless German immigrant who came to own one of the biggest breweries in town.''</p>
        <p>Dressed in Louis XIV decor, the house was outfitted with rosewood floors, stained-glass windows, embossed leather walls and a five-story atrium capped with an elaborate copper-filigreed dome.</p>
        <p>The Kruegers moved out at the end of World War I, and the house became the headquarters of a construction company. In 1925, it was bought by the Valley of Newark Scottish Rite, a Masonic organization that left its painted gold insignia on the dining room walls.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Roundtree, who owned a hotel and a chain of beauty schools, bought the building in 1958 and converted it back into a residence. Over the years, she used the rambling house as a nursery school, a neighborhood cultural center and offices for the Scott College of Beauty Culture.</p>
        <p>By the time Mrs. Roundtree died in 1982, her fortune had dwindled and the city, saying she owed back taxes, seized the house and evicted her family. Left unattended, the house was stripped of its furnishings, its massive organ and the hand-carved baroque columns that supported a staircase.</p>
        <p>''It's been horribly cannibalized,'' said Douglas Eldridge, executive director of the Newark Preservation and Landmarks Committee, who toured the house before Ms. Scott's death. ''If the city had secured it when it took it over, things wouldn't have gotten so bad.''</p>
        <p>By the late 1980's, a group of preservationists were rallying around the house. In 1990 they won a $625,800 grant from the New Jersey Historic Trust and a spot for the house on the National Register of Historic Places. The city of Newark matched that amount, and over the years devoted  more than $4 million to turning the home into a center focusing on the black contribution to Newark's development. The federal government contributed an additional $1.5 million.</p>
        <p>In 1993, Mayor James recruited a curator from the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, Catherine J. Lenix-Hooker, to raise money, resurrect the building and get the cultural program off the ground. Although her book parties, concerts and poetry readings were deemed a success, the restoration effort, critics say, fell victim to runaway overspending.</p>
        <p>Work stopped for a year while Ms. Lenix-Hooker looked for a company to reproduce 23,000 thin ''Lincoln Red'' bricks. Specialized craftsmen were hired to replicate the terra-cotta tiles, the coachmen's portico, and the carved caryatids that hold up the massive front porch. All 140 windows were replaced, and structural work was done to prop up listing walls.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Lenix-Hooker came back to City Hall two years ago looking for more money, the Council balked. The mayor, facing criticism and negative press, pulled her off the job. ''I think the project was beyond her talents,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Lenix-Hooker has plenty of defenders, who say she was sacrificed to satisfy the Council's mounting discontent. Historic restoration, they point out, is a costly endeavor, something that many elected officials failed to appreciate.</p>
        <p>''The work called for a high level of craftsmanship and high quality materials that will last for decades,'' said Harriette Hawkins, director of the New Jersey Historic Trust. ''For a new building of that scale and bravado, you couldn't even put a price tag on it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lenix-Hooker, now in charge of marketing for Newark Symphony Hall, defends her work, saying the house was in worse shape than anyone had expected. ''They don't understand that this was not about patching up an old building,'' she said. Once the press labeled the house a white elephant, she said, raising private money became impossible.</p>
        <p>She added that her fund-raising efforts were eclipsed by those for the New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts, then under construction, which had dozens of staff members devoted to raising money. ''I was the only one doing this, and in the end, I got terribly bashed,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Since work stopped two years ago, the site has been ringed by a chain-link fence and guarded round the clock. Despite Council opposition, the housing authority is still considering its own rehabilitation plan, although it has yet to say what the building's final use would be.</p>
        <p>Seeking a better assessment of the project's potential costs, the agency hired a team of engineers this month to survey the moldering interior and probe its underlying structure. Although hints of the building's former grandeur are still evident, including heavy oak doors and gilded rococo plasterwork, much of the house is a wreck. The debris-filled elevator slumps in its shaft, the fruitwood parquet floors have been damaged by years of rain, and the elaborate Craftsman-style banister has been mangled by looters.</p>
        <p>As he inspected the decay recently, Peter Meyer, president of PPE, an engineering firm, shook his head with a mix of awe and despair. ''It's definitely doable,'' he said. ''But it's clearly a major, major job.'' The housing authority has said it is willing to spend upward of $5 million to make the building useful again.</p>
        <p>Although the Krueger-Scott Mansion may get another chance at life, it seems increasingly doubtful that the home's interior will get the exacting restoration that preservationists and others have long expected. And some worry that in its haste to finish the job, the city will jettison its original purpose, to create a cultural center devoted to black history.</p>
        <p>Among those eager to see the house brought back to life is Genevieve Tobin Scranton, one of Gottfried Krueger's granddaughters. Mrs. Scranton, 76, who lives in Vermont, would like to see the house turned into a museum of Newark's brewery past. ''We all feel so helpless,'' she said. ''When I think of what the house was, and what it has become, I feel sick.''</p>
