        <p>AMONG the epiphanies that Internet executives had last year, as they pondered routes to profitability, was the notion that Web sites need a healthy mix of the three C's -- content, commerce and community.</p>
        <p>Following that mandate was easy enough as long as venture capitalists were elbowing for a seat at the poker table.</p>
        <p>But as the venture folks pulled their chips off the table, executives were forced to realize that dealing with even one of the C's was difficult and expensive enough -- let alone all three.</p>
        <p>Generating content, in particular, proved much harder than many Internet companies had expected. Given the Web public's insatiable appetite for new information, sites must constantly refresh their editorial content, either with their own stables of writers and multimedia producers or by striking deals with other sites that can provide that material.</p>
        <p>But both approaches have given Internet executives headaches. Sites that license content from media companies or other content-heavy businesses must go to great lengths to synchronize their technology, so the articles and multimedia clips can flow easily from one place to another. Such partnerships also require close monitoring: the last thing executives of RollingStone.com, for instance, want to see is one of their stories running, heavily edited, on some portion of a partner's site that has nothing to do with music.</p>
        <p>Of course, producing one's own material can also have drawbacks -- like working with writers who don't grasp the meaning of deadlines, or video producers who don't grasp the meaning of budgets.</p>
        <p>These problems have not been lost on so-called online content syndicators, a relatively new category of Internet businesses that act as intermediaries between sites that need content and sites that want to sell it. Companies like iSyndicate, ScreamingMedia, YellowBrix and NewsEdge are quickly building their client lists as Web executives look for help in filling their sites with material that will keep users on the page.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, media companies and others that supply content have found that syndicators have given them a much-needed, and unexpected, revenue source.</p>
        <p>''Demand for these services is definitely growing,'' said Dan O'Brien, senior analyst with Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm. ''And the law of supply and demand indicates that as the Web grows -- and as the need for content grows faster than the supply -- this will pay off much more than it does now.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Jupiter Communications, another research firm, forecasts that online content syndication and licensing will amount to a $1.5 billion market in 2004, up from $343 million this year. Analysts say the leading content syndicators are iSyndicate and ScreamingMedia.</p>
        <p>ScreamingMedia, which went public in the summer, sells the content of more than 2,800 online publishers to roughly 1,100 Web sites, while iSyndicate offers the content of about 1,200 publishers to some 270,000 sites.</p>
        <p>In the case of iSyndicate, which rolled out in 1997, the company takes video, audio, photos and text from publishers and offers the material to customers in categories like health or sports. For fees ranging from $50,000 to $500,000 per year, iSyndicate can also publish the content on its own servers, track the performance of the content and advise companies on how to improve that performance.</p>
        <p>ScreamingMedia, meanwhile, filters content to suit each particular site's needs. If a health site wants news about leukemia or allergies, for example, ScreamingMedia's technology will filter all stories related to those subjects and send the most relevant ones to the site. In addition to a one-time set-up fee of between $3,000 and $40,000, subscribers pay between $500 and $50,000 per month, which buys thousands of articles or multimedia clips.</p>
        <p>Notably, in both cases, the syndicators screen the sites that buy the content, to make sure it is used in ways that conform to the original publisher's standards. Meanwhile, syndicators also send the content to their customers in a format that suits their particular computer systems. Executives say the benefits of this formatting were difficult to quantify, but crucial.</p>
        <p>Andrew Fritz, president of Fringe Golf.com, a content site that also sells its own brand of merchandise, said that when the site rolled out in 1998, it wanted to run golf-related stories and scores from the Associated Press wires. ''But with the A.P., there was a pretty long process to integrate systems with them -- you either had to set up a satellite dish or wire your building for it,'' he said. ''And it cost about $1,000 or $1,500 a month, which was a lot for us then.''</p>
        <p>The company also lacked the resources to generate that content on its own. ''But iSyndicate let us buy just A.P.'s golf sports news, whereas with A.P. we'd have to buy the whole sports category,'' Mr. Fritz said. ''So it's actually less expensive -- something like $500 a month -- for us to just get A.P.'s golf information from iSyndicate, and we don't need to spend any energy integrating it into our site.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fritz said FringeGolf.com was now negotiating with iSyndicate to have its original content sold to iSyndicate's affiliates. ''Being able to play both sides is a real advantage for us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. O'Brien of Forrester, Web executives looking to sell their content through syndicators should not get too excited about becoming rich in the process.</p>
        <p>''If a company makes a lot of money through this, it's the exception rather than the rule,'' he said. Because the syndicators typically keep 70 percent of each sale, Mr. O'Brien said, ''it wouldn't be worth doing the deal if money was the sole focus.''</p>
        <p>Instead, he said, media companies and Web site publishers that provide content are more intent on using syndicators to get their information -- and their brand names -- on thousands of other sites, while letting marketing executives concentrate on other matters.</p>
        <p>''And it's also a matter of competitive displacement,'' Mr. O'Brien said. If ABC's video clip appears on a given site, for instance, NBC, CBS and Fox lose that opportunity for exposure.</p>
        <p>None of this means, of course, that media companies are interested in spreading all of their content to the outer reaches of the Web.</p>
        <p>''We have to make sure we're not giving away too much,'' said Dan Chiss, director of marketing and business development for Rolling Stone.com, a unit of Wenner Media that licenses its content and that of Rolling Stone magazine to both iSyndicate and ScreamingMedia. ''We want to keep our best content close to the vest.''</p>
        <p>For instance, he said, online syndicators can never sell Rolling Stone's cover story, ''because that's our most precious asset, and we want to keep people coming back to our site.'' But the company does sell enough articles and photos through syndicators to earn monthly revenues ''in the five figures,'' Mr. Chiss said. ''And it comes at really no cost to us.''</p>
        <p>Those sales should continue to grow, as the Web's global reach grows, Mr. Chiss said. ''Rolling Stone is a pretty ubiquitous brand, and music is something that really has no language barriers,'' he said. ''So we're definitely looking forward to seeing where this goes.''</p>
