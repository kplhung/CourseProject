        <p>Peter Vagenas volunteers for penalty kicks. Not everybody does. Some of the most productive scorers in soccer history would just as soon inspect the light stanchions or the clumps of grass when the call goes out for volunteers. But Vagenas wants the ball.</p>
        <p>His eagerness to knock home a potential freebie has helped bring the United States to Sydney, to say nothing of the semifinals of the Summer Games. The men's soccer team has become one of the biggest surprises of the huge American enterprise here, and will play Spain on Tuesday night at Sydney Football Stadium.</p>
        <p>Vagenas had a lot to do with it, although he plays down his impact. He scored a penalty kick at 90 minutes to tie the score with Japan, 2-2, on Saturday night in Adelaide. Then, after 30 minutes of overtime, Vagenas asked for the first penalty kick and converted it, and the Americans went on for a 5-4 victory in penalty kicks.</p>
        <p>''The hardest thing is to draw the penalty kick, not to make it,'' said Vagenas, who is 22 years old and plays for the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer.</p>
        <p>He gave praise to Josh Wolff for forcing a Japanese defender to knock him down. The penalty kick does not automatically go to the fallen player but to either the coach's choice or the first volunteer on the field. That was Vagenas, who was captain for U.C.L.A. in college.</p>
        <p>''It's not the penalty kick I like but the intensity,'' he said tonight as the team headed for Sydney. ''It's what it's all about. One on one. Mano a mano. Pressure is something athletes like.''</p>
        <p>That is not precisely true, but Vagenas showed he liked pressure against Cameroon by scoring on a penalty kick. He volunteered Saturday night to face the Japanese goalkeeper, Seigo Narazaki, who had just sustained a bloody nose in a collision with his own defender. ''Peter told me that he wanted to go first,'' said Clive Charles, the coach. ''I gave him the privilege of going first and then moved everybody down one. I originally had him down to take the last one. So Peter decided who went first and then I made a decision on the other four.''</p>
        <p>The only miss among the first 10 players, amazingly enough, was Hidetoshi Nakata, the Japanese star, who plays for Roma in Italy's top league, Serie A. Nakata hit the left post on the fourth attempt.</p>
        <p>''He's arguably one of the best players in the world, but great players are human, too,'' Vagenas said.</p>
        <p>This is the first time the United States has ever advanced even to the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>''We're riding the wave right now,''  Vagenas said. ''We've got two days to prepare, but we could play right now if we had to.''</p>
