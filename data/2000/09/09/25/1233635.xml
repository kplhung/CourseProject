        <p>At its annual strategy session late last week, AT&amp;T's board opted to continue discussions with British Telecommunications  about a potential combination of the two carriers' units that sell communications services to business customers, a person close to AT&amp;T said over the weekend.</p>
        <p>No deal between AT&amp;T and British Telecommunications is imminent, however, the person said, and the negotiations with the British carrier remain among the options that AT&amp;T is pursuing as the company tries to bolster its flagging stock. The person said that AT&amp;T's board was less enthusiastic about a potential combination of the wireless communications divisions at AT&amp;T and British Telecommunications but that such a deal had not been ruled out.</p>
        <p>Unless AT&amp;T's shares stage a remarkable comeback over the next month or so, AT&amp;T is all but sure to embark on some sort of restructuring aimed at ''unlocking'' the value in its operations. As AT&amp;T has made acquisitions to become the nation's No. 1 cable television provider, the company has taken on new directors who have large holdings of AT&amp;T stock, namely John C. Malone, the former chairman of Tele-Communications Inc., and Amos B. Hostetter, formerly the largest shareholder at Mediaone Group Inc. As AT&amp;T's stock has plunged from more than $60 a share this spring to its close of $29.63 Friday, the value of their holdings have declined by hundreds of millions of dollars, at least.</p>
        <p>People close to AT&amp;T have said that the chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, wants to make a decision on any potential restructuring by the end of this fall. British Telecommunications, the top phone company in Britain, has said that it expected its discussions with AT&amp;T to reach a conclusion, with or without a deal, by the end of the year. Representatives of AT&amp;T and British Telecommunications declined to comment.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T's directors convened near the company's headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J., on Thursday night for the meeting, which lasted through midday Saturday. A person close to AT&amp;T's board said the meeting was meant to allow the directors to winnow the menu of restructuring options the company's executives and investment bankers had been considering.</p>
        <p>In addition to the potential deals with British Telecommunications, that menu has included a spinoff, the issuing of a new tracking stock, or a combination with AT&amp;T's cable operation for AT&amp;T's shrinking consumer long-distance telephone unit as well as an acquisition of Nextel Communications Inc., the wireless carrier. It is not clear which, if any, of those options were rejected by the board. One person close to AT&amp;T's board said yesterday that the directors heard presentations from executives about ''a dozen or more'' alternatives. The board approved about five of these for consideration.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T, the nation's No. 1 communications company, is casting about for new directions because the company's stock, like that of many big United States communications carriers, is in a rut. Fears that too many companies are chasing too few customers and concerns that long-distance telephone calls have become a low-margin commodity have scared many investors away from the communications sector. Last week, one of AT&amp;T's major competitors, the Sprint Corporation, said it would not meet analysts' financial expectations for the current quarter.</p>
        <p>For AT&amp;T, a combination of its business-services unit with that of British Telecommunications would theoretically give the combined unit a leg up in pursuing contracts with the world's biggest corporations, perhaps the most lucrative niche in the communications market. The two companies are already partners in an international venture known as Concert, but that operation has not been a major success.</p>
        <p>In fact, Concert may have done more harm than good for AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T mismanaged its relationship with some of its biggest corporate customers over the last year as the company tried to transfer those accounts into Concert. Those missteps led AT&amp;T's business-services unit to miss its financial targets, helping send AT&amp;T's stock into the tailspin.</p>
