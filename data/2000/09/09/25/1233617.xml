        <p>NATURAL BLONDE/A Memoir  By Liz Smith  Illustrated. 460 pages. Hyperion. $25.95.</p>
        <p>FOUR BLONDES  By Candace Bushnell  245 pages. Atlantic Monthly Press. $24.</p>
        <p>There are pictures of Mary Elizabeth Smith throughout her memoir, and she seldom looks the same twice. That chameleon quality has been all-important to her life and career. She wrote for Sports Illustrated and Cosmopolitan simultaneously. She morphed from the child her father called ''my best boy'' to flirty ingenue. She took potshots in print at Frank Sinatra but melted into goo when courted by the singer. (''I loved him. I had a feeling for what it would be like to be in his strong and capable arms.'') And throughout it all Liz Smith was in it for the fun.</p>
        <p>''Gossip makes you interesting and boosts your self-esteem at having information to relate,'' she says at the start of ''Natural Blonde,'' while also pointing out that ''among the first gossips of history was Homer.'' But relax: this isn't that kind of book. Sonny and Cher's names are more likely to be dropped than those of any further ancient Greeks, and the author's natural tone remains that of a breathless pajama-party confidante. ''I can't begin to find space to write about all the sexy major stars I've known in this odd career,'' she declares, apropos of Warren Beatty.</p>
        <p>Fresh from a Fort Worth girlhood (with memories of ''when people had broken arms from having had the hand crank that started the Model T turn backwards on them'') and college years at the University of Texas (where Jayne Mansfield was a fellow student), Ms. Smith realized what attracted her: the glamorous ideal of fame, New York-style.</p>
        <p>She arrived there after two brief marriages and, quicker than you can say El Morocco, began working her way into that world. From her first bold phone call to Randolph Scott for Modern Screen to her scoop about Madonna's pregnancy, Ms. Smith felt perfectly at home in a journalistic realm where the latter qualified as earthshaking news. And she understood that the way to navigate star-infested waters was to avoid making waves.</p>
        <p>''Wouldn't you rather I dealt with it Liz Smith-style?'' she says she asks when trying to persuade celebrities to send news items her way. Because this is a nicer alternative than seeing the same story doused with flaming gasoline in the supermarket tabloids, Ms. Smith has found herself in perk-filled proximity to many well-known figures, and her book describes them with exhaustive affection. ''To Sir, With Love'' is the name of a chapter about Sir David Frost. Barbara Walters is ''the biggest star and the grandest V.I.P. in the world.'' By the time Ms. Smith reprints a Vanity Fair questionnaire in which she named ''self-defeating generosity'' as her most marked characteristic, no reader need wonder what she means.</p>
        <p>Naturally, for reasons that are basic to Ms. Smith's very calling, it is far preferable to read snarky tales of those, like Phil Silvers, Allen Funt and Shelley Winters, who had the poor acumen to treat a budding gossip badly. Or to learn that when she offered advice to George Cukor on the set of ''The Bluebird,'' he told her: ''Are you the person who directed Spencer and Kate in 'Pat and Mike'? Stick to writing for Cosmo!'' To her credit Ms. Smith tells these stories in a good-humored, self-effacing way that makes it easy to see why she has so many friends.</p>
        <p>''You may wonder if during all these comings and goings, to-ings and fro-ings, I had any personal life outside of work,'' she writes. And you may keep on wondering, because a lifetime's worth of weighing others' privacy has left her cautious about her own. Incidents of shocking heterosexuality abound, and Ms. Smith also briefly describes a homosexual college romance that caused a rift between her and her parents. But this is a more chatty book than a candid one, and so the author is apt to guard her pronouns, as when ''the fabulous person I had gone to Paris to be with got fed up and stormed out.'' She continues, ''Hell hath no fury like a romantic who finds their loved one pounding a rented French typewriter, concentrating on a deadline.''</p>
        <p>All in all Ms. Smith sounds like a good person with whom to share a lifeboat, particularly if you happened to be well known. Candace Bushnell, on the other hand, would toss you overboard without batting an eye. In ''Four Blondes,'' her own more entertainingly reprehensible take on the fair-haired life, Ms. Bushnell writes with the same acerbic ruthlessness that has made ''Sex and the City'' such a touchstone of its times. ''I heard he was pulled over for drunk driving and got caught stuffing a vial of cocaine in his sock,'' one character tsk-tsks from the Hamptons. ''Socks! In the summer!'' Who says these aren't moral tales?</p>
        <p>In her understandably best-selling collection, Ms. Bushnell has assembled four stories, named them for hair-lightening methods (''Single Process,'' ''Nice N'Easy'') and arranged them in declining order of coherence and success. She begins with the tale of a model named Janey, who may be selfish and ambitious but otherwise has nothing in common with heroines by the Jackies (Susann and Collins) who are Ms. Bushnell's spiritual forebears.</p>
        <p>Janey, an anomie-filled creature of this moment, is simply too bored and jaded for the old-fashioned scheming that might be expected of her. She would rather wait and see what, or whom, falls into her lap and only occasionally is moved to real emotion. ''I loved him,'' she tells herself about the loss of a rich boyfriend (the only kind who interests Janey). ''Did not,'' she replies to herself. ''You're only upset because he was going to take you to Bouley to dinner and you wanted the foie gras.''</p>
        <p>Inevitably, since anxiety and vanity are all-important among Ms. Bushnell's wisecracking characters, Janey begins to feel that even her body is out of vogue. ''I could take out the implants,'' she suggests to a friend. ''But,'' he answers, ''can you take out everything else?''</p>
