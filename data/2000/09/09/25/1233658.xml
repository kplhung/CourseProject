        <p>There is more at stake in the race for governor of the Mexican gulf coast state of Tabasco than who will succeed its powerful lame-duck incumbent. The outcome is likely to decide the fate of the dethroned political party that had ruled Mexico for seven decades.</p>
        <p>The stakes become clear during a whirlwind day in Tabasco with the departing Governor, Roberto Madrazo Pintado. Although barred from serving a second term, the governor is rushing through Mexican campaign rituals like presiding over ceremonies for new roads and drinking water systems as well as making promises for a better tomorrow. A suave, back-room operator who relishes flouting the rules, Mr. Madrazo knows he must deliver a victory to his handpicked successor, Manuel Andrade Diaz.</p>

        <p>There is more at stake in the race for governor of the Mexican gulf coast state of Tabasco than who will succeed its powerful lame-duck incumbent. The outcome is likely to decide the fate of the dethroned political party that had ruled Mexico for seven decades.</p>
        <p>The stakes become clear during a whirlwind day in Tabasco with the departing Governor, Roberto Madrazo Pintado. Although barred from serving a second term, the governor is rushing through Mexican campaign rituals like presiding over ceremonies for new roads and drinking water systems as well as making promises for a better tomorrow. A suave, back-room operator who relishes flouting the rules, Mr. Madrazo knows he must deliver a victory to his handpicked successor, Manuel Andrade Diaz.</p>
        <p>A win in Tabasco would be the first political lifeline for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (known by its acronym in Spanish, PRI), which has been flailing since losing the presidency last July. And, Mr. Madrazo hopes, it would propel him into the post of president of the party.</p>
        <p>By tending tirelessly to the needs of his constituents, Mr. Madrazo holds himself up as a model of the  politician his party needs to survive. But because of his reputation as a PRI strongman, his critics warn that the governor would only hasten the party's demise.</p>
        <p>''One of the greatest errors of the party was that it stopped representing the interests of the people, and represented the interests of small groups,'' said Mr. Madrazo. ''The people felt this and so they abandoned the party. If we give the power of the party back to the people, the people will come back to the party.''</p>
        <p>People inside the party say that rather than developing its own ideological core, the party has always bent to the will of the president in power.</p>
        <p>Now, for the first time since its creation in 1929, the party must walk on its own.</p>
        <p>The party should be able to exert some political power. It still holds slight majorities in both houses of Congress. After Vicente Fox Quesada assumes the presidency in December, some 19 of the nation's 31 governors will be members of the PRI, and it will control 65 percent of the nation's local legislatures. But without the power of the country's presidency as a unifying force, long-simmering differences between the party's technocrats, who advocate free-market reforms, and its traditional political strongmen, who rely more on paternalistic handouts, have blown into full-scale battles for control.</p>
        <p>''In the short term, we are going to have to accept that there is going to be only bad news for the PRI,'' said Humberto Roque Villanueva, a senator and former president of the party. ''It will continue to lose elections, but that is the least of its problems. There is so much internal hostility, that reaching agreements will be very painful. Our worst nights are still to come.''</p>
        <p>Others refuse to dwell on the darkness ahead, and want to look optimistically to a longer-term future.</p>
        <p>''I do not know if in the end the party will be called PRI, whether it will be the same party, with the same people,'' said Sabino Bastides, 32, the youngest member of the party's national executive committee. But it still can garner support ''because of all the PRI has to offer -- a progressive, liberal, democratic party with a long history of support for national causes.''</p>
        <p>Still, almost everyone acknowledges that there have been distress signals since the July elections, in which the party failed to win significant support among the nation's fastest growing demographic groups: young people, skilled workers and educated, middle-class urbanites.</p>
        <p>While he has been president, Ernesto Zedillo and other leaders of the PRI helped enact laws that strengthened opposition parties and established transparent electoral agencies. Voters, however, blamed the party for rampant corruption, soaring crime and economic policies that bailed out banks and wealthy borrowers, while lowering wages for poor workers.</p>
        <p>Now it seems the PRI has lost the ability to enforce discipline within its own ranks.</p>
        <p>In a rare display of rancor, the party's congressional delegates gave only lukewarm applause during President Zedillo's State of the Union address earlier this month. And one PRI legislator stood during the address with his back to the president.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, at a conference of a reform wing of the party called Alternative, there were calls for a ''democratic rebellion'' that would allow the party's leadership and platform to be decided by a vote of its members across the nation. And at the most recent convention of the National Campesino Confederation, a farm group that has been the PRI's most loyal bastion of support, delegates shouted insults at the party's secretary general.</p>
        <p>Most of Mexico's political parties felt the shock waves of the momentous election in July. The left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution, known as the P.R.D., lost more than half its seats in Congress. Three fledgling parties lost their registrations last week because they each failed to win 2 percent of the vote. And the big electoral winner, the conservative National Action Party of Mr. Fox, has itself sunk into an identity crisis because he openly courts his opponents while snubbing proposals from his own party.</p>
        <p>But the PRI's fall has been the most dramatic, and the choice of its next party president will likely decide its fate.</p>
        <p>''In very simple terms, if PRI does not announce a new president between now and December 1, I think it is a doomed party,'' said Denise Dresser, a political analyst at the Pacific Council on International Policy at the University of Southern California. ''The PRI can rebuild itself at the local level or tear itself apart at the national level. It can choose to unify or succumb to internal fights, to wage wars between all and against all. But it must decide now.''</p>
        <p>Of the numerous names mentioned for the job, Mr. Madrazo is considered the most likely to prevail. ''He's the only leader left standing,'' Ms. Dresser said, ''and the only one who has any real followers.''</p>
        <p>From his own actions, it appears that Mr. Fox's political instincts tell him the same thing. During a recent meeting with governors from southern Mexican states, Mr. Fox greeted Mr. Madrazo with a hug, while giving handshakes to the others.</p>
        <p>At age 47, Mr. Madrazo leads one of the most traditional factions of the party and, much like a Chicago ward boss, he has kept his party the dominant political power in largely poor and rural Tabasco.</p>
        <p>Mr. Madrazo has won the support of most of the governors in the party, and he is widely popular among poor farmers, organized labor and local political leaders.</p>
        <p>But to people outside the party, Mr. Madrazo represents the corrupt and repressive reputation that cost the party the election in July. His political career is tarnished by numerous accusations of misuse of funds and illegal business deals.</p>
        <p>Not long after Mr. Madrazo was elected governor of Tabasco six years ago, opposition leaders produced volumes of receipts and ledgers that offered evidence that he had illegally spent millions of dollars of public funds on his campaign. President Zedillo tried to force him to resign but Mr. Madrazo, who has always denied the charges, orchestrated a furious public backlash against the president, who was forced to back down.</p>
        <p>It was a victory that helped propel the bad-boy image that Mr. Madrazo wears like a badge of honor, calling himself a disciple of his  father, Carlos Alberto Madrazo, who led a popular reform movement in the late 1960's to open up the party.</p>
        <p>''The only way to bring unity to the party will be to select a leader who has real legitimacy,'' said Mr. Madrazo, ''and that legitimacy must come from a democratic election.''</p>
