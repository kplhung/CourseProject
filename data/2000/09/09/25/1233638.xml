        <p>As described in October 1994, the dream was a new-style entertainment company in which three of the media business's most successful people  would have total freedom to create films, TV shows and music albums, while also developing new-media enterprises.</p>
        <p>So bold and exciting were the plans laid out by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen that many newspapers published articles about them on Page 1. The ''dream team,'' as they called themselves, named their company DreamWorks SKG, implying that it had a future that was as unlimited as their fertile imaginations.</p>

        <p>As described in October 1994, the dream was a new-style entertainment company in which three of the media business's most successful people  would have total freedom to create films, TV shows and music albums, while also developing new-media enterprises.</p>
        <p>So bold and exciting were the plans laid out by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen that many newspapers published articles about them on Page 1. The ''dream team,'' as they called themselves, named their company DreamWorks SKG, implying that it had a future that was as unlimited as their fertile imaginations.</p>
        <p>But after six years that saw the rise of the World Wide Web, the proliferation of digital music and the advent of digital television the bold DreamWorks trio has found true success only in Hollywood's oldest and financially riskiest profession -- making movies. The lesson, if there is one, may be that the multimedia game is a hard one for even media moguls to master.</p>
        <p>To be sure, what DreamWorks does well, it does exceedingly well. Through early September, the 20 films it has released since 1997 have averaged $78.7 million at the box office, a batting average some 15 percent ahead of any other studio, according to the research firm ACNielsen EDI. And those hits included two multiple Academy Award winners: 1998's ''Saving Private Ryan'' and 1999's ''American Beauty.''</p>
        <p>And this year so far, three of DreamWorks' seven releases have surpassed the $100 million threshold that separates the superlative from the so-so. And ''Almost Famous,'' the director Cameron Crowe's reminiscences of his teenage years as a rock 'n' roll reporter, is off to a hot start, grossing an estimated $10.3 million since its limited-release opening two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Over all this year, DreamWorks ranks a close second behind Walt Disney's Buena Vista in total box office revenue -- even though Buena Vista has released nearly twice as many movies. ''It's an awesome record,'' one rival said. But industry analysts note that the movie business is the most volatile part of the entertainment industry, giving the DreamWorks portfolio a dangerous lack of diversity.</p>
        <p>DreamWorks, of course, does not owe the world popular culture in all flavors and formats. Nor is it under the stock market scrutiny to which the media leviathans like Disney and Time Warner are subjected. As a privately held company, it is financially accountable only to its investors, who seem content.</p>
        <p>''We are long-term investors,'' said William Savoy, who represents the billionaire Paul Allen, owner of a roughly $600 million stake in DreamWorks. ''We believe that huge value is being created for the long term. As long as that is the trajectory we are on, we are thrilled to be investors.''</p>
        <p>Yet, in creative fields other than films, the dream team has worked little magic. ABC's ''Spin City'' is the only TV hit to have emerged from DreamWorks, though the company routinely produces network pilots.</p>
        <p>In music, the industry where Mr. Geffen made his name and money, DreamWorks expects revenue of $100 million this year, which he said was ahead of the pace his former company achieved in its early years. Still, DreamWorks has but one album, Papa Roche's ''Infest,'' among Soundscan's top 50.</p>
        <p>As for new media, the DreamWorks trio has had to learn the meaning of a word previously unfamiliar to them: flop. Last month, after spending at least $7 million to develop Pop.com, an entertainment Web site, DreamWorks and its partner in the venture, Imagine Entertainment, terminated the business before the Web site had even opened.</p>
        <p>Like other companies trying to create entertainment Web sites, Pop.com found that developing compelling material was a costly proposition that presented no clear revenue opportunities.</p>
        <p>And so, for better or worse, these days ''we're essentially in the movie business,'' Mr. Geffen said in a recent interview at his 10-acre estate in Beverly Hills, Calif.</p>
        <p>With him was Mr. Katzenberg, who had been one of the most powerful producers and executives at Disney before leaving to start DreamWorks. The two executives, both wearing khakis and T-shirts, were joined by the top executives of DreamWorks' live film operation: Walter Parkes and his wife, Laurie  MacDonald. (Mr. Spielberg was away working on ''A.I.,'' a techno-thriller about artificial intelligence that will star Jude Law and Haley Joel Osment.)</p>
        <p>While acknowledging that they had scaled back the original DreamWorks plan, the executives betrayed little disappointment over their curbed ambitions.</p>
        <p>''I would say that I wish we were more lucky or better,'' Mr. Katzenberg said of DreamWorks' limited success in network television. But like Mr. Geffen, he spoke not of failure but of changed circumstances.</p>
        <p>''Every business has changed in significant ways,'' he said, though several industry critics say the company's performance has been disappointing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Geffen noted, for instance, that the record business had become ''extraordinarily'' expensive. ''It used to be a cheap-entry business, where you could sign an artist for less that $100,000,'' he said. ''Today you can't.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Katzenberg pointed out that changes in federal regulation that allowed the TV networks to take bigger ownership stakes in programs mean the networks produce more of their own programming now than five years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Geffen added that television, which DreamWorks had originally seen as a core business, was now ''one of those businesses that are in the margins of what we do but give Steven and Jeffrey an opportunity to do things they really enjoy.''</p>
        <p>But that joy has its limits. Just last week, for instance, NBC pulled the plug on ''Semper Fi,'' a big-budget dramatic series about life in the Marine Corps that Mr. Spielberg was to have produced for introduction in midseason. After viewing the pilot, NBC executives concluded it would not work as a series.</p>
        <p>Over all, Mr. Katzenberg said that for the first time ''the company is generating free cash flow.'' He offered no specific numbers, but he meant that DreamWorks still had cash left over after meeting interest payments and capital expenditures. Cash flow is the preferred metric for media companies because it speaks to the ability to generate enough revenue to pay stars and underwrite multimillion-dollar production and marketing budgets -- to get the next show on the road, in other words.</p>
        <p>But generating free cash flow, is not the same as being profitable, which DreamWorks is not.</p>
        <p>''Movies are the most capital intensive, volatile and low margin of the entertainment businesses,'' said David Londoner, who follows entertainment for ABN Amro. ''Profit margins run from negative 10 percent to only about 10 percent when a company is doing well.''</p>
        <p>It is to the dream team's credit that so far it has beaten the odds in movies. But forecasting future performance is notoriously hard in a business dependent on hits -- and harder yet at DreamWorks, where the library of existing films does not yet provide enough revenue to offset periods without new hits.</p>
        <p>Initially, Mr. Katzenberg, Mr. Geffen and Mr. Spielberg put up a total of $100 million for two-thirds of the company. They have raised an additional $900 million, principally from Mr. Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, who now owns 24.5 percent of the company, and from the Cheil Jedang Corporation, a Korean company. The company has also borrowed about $500 million from Chase Manhattan, and $350 million from Bear Stearns.</p>
        <p>Based on the price of $500 million Mr. Allen paid in 1995 for an initial 18 percent stake, DreamWorks at the time would have had a market value of $3 billion. ''A pure financial investor with a preferred stock might look for a compound rate of about 20 percent,'' one venture capital expert said. By that reasoning, DreamWorks should have a market value of about $6.4 billion today, but no financial analyst interviewed for this article thought it could fetch such a price.</p>
        <p>The founders, who say they are not looking to sell, note that DreamWorks would not be the kind of company to start if the point was a huge payoff by traditional measures. ''If we were simply about where is the most amount of money for us to make, we wouldn't be in this area,''  Mr. Geffen said. ''This is not the best arena for us to make money. But it is the best arena for us to do what we do with the least amount of interference. And what we believe is, over time, we will build a very, very attractive, substantial library.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Geffen said DreamWorks had even begun paying down the money  it had borrowed from Chase Manhattan. ''Our investment spending has peaked,'' he said. Just two weeks ago, Columbia Pictures wrote DreamWorks a check for $100 million for half-interest in ''Almost Famous'' and two yet-to-be-released films, ''Evolution'' and ''Everlasting Piece.''</p>
        <p>Sharing the cost of film production with other big studios is one way to hedge against the industry's inherent financial risks. Mr. Spielberg, who raised industry eyebrows during  DreamWorks' early years by making some films for other companies,  plans to produce and direct at least two and possibly three movies that will be co-productions between DreamWorks and other studios. After ''A.I.'' for DreamWorks and Warner Brothers, he will produce and direct ''Minority Report,'' a science fiction film with Tom Cruise that will be shared by DreamWorks and 20th Century Fox.</p>
        <p>It is Mr. Parkes and Ms. MacDonald who make the day-to-day decisions about the live action movies, while Mr. Katzenberg oversees the animation division. But Mr. Spielberg's presence is felt throughout the company's film business.</p>
        <p>When the producer Jake Eberts met with Mr. Katzenberg for dinner to discuss DreamWorks' financing Mr. Eberts's film ''Chicken Run,'' for instance, Mr. Spielberg joined them because he was familiar with the work of the movie's directors,  Nick Park and Peter Lord.</p>
        <p>''Jeffrey did not just trot Steven out,'' Mr. Eberts recalled. ''Steven was very knowledgeable about their work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eberts said that Disney had also expressed interest in backing the film. ''But Jeffrey pursued me with a terrier-like passion,'' he said. ''Disney didn't have that commitment.''</p>
        <p>In the case of ''A.I.,'' Mr. Geffen recalled, he and Mr. Spielberg were flying to New York one day in 1996, when Mr. Spielberg told him that ''the best project he had read was 'A.I.,' but he couldn't get hold of it.''</p>
        <p>The script, by the filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, was under development by Warner Brothers. Mr. Geffen said he began a two-and-a-half year effort to secure the project for Mr. Spielberg -- an effort that involved ''endless conversations with Terry Semel,'' who was then the Warner Brothers chairman. ''Steve kept telling me, 'You're wasting your time; this is never going to happen,' '' Mr. Geffen recalled.</p>
        <p>But after Mr. Kubrick died in March 1999, DreamWorks was able to work out a joint venture with Warner Brothers for the project, with Mr. Spielberg as director.</p>
        <p>Despite its success in films, the dream team has shown no particular edge in the Internet business.</p>
        <p>A person familiar with the development of Pop.com said several Internet experts had warned DreamWorks that the involvement of Mr. Allen could ''make it harder to get distribution on AOL, Yahoo and Microsoft because there was some resentment toward Mr. Allen at those companies.''</p>
        <p>And with its substantial financing, Pop.com too often seemed to throw money at problems, critics said. For example, Pop.com offered Steve Martin $100,000 to make a two-minute film for the Web site, even though there was no evidence Web audiences want short films.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Geffen is quick to note, DreamWorks is not the only entertainment company to have failed on the Web. But the DreamWorks failure was particularly public, and its executives were singularly thin-skinned. After a critical article about Pop.com in The Los Angeles Times in July, the unit's head, Kenneth Wong, brought a pinata to work, pinned the writer's name on it and encouraged staffers to batter it, a former employee recalled.</p>
        <p>Even as Pop.com was dying last month, reports appeared about a possible a merger with Ifilm, which never materialized. It was only the latest of rumors that DreamWorks is about to merge or sell or mutate in one way or another.</p>
        <p>But the dream team is not interested in merging with anybody, and there are no such talks under way at the moment, Mr. Geffen said.</p>
        <p>''We started DreamWorks because it allows us to do what we do in an atmosphere where we are in charge of it,'' Mr. Geffen said. ''We're not frustrated by having to deal with other people and their agendas and their priorities and their tastes. We're dealing with our own.''</p>
