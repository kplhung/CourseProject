        <p>For five long years, New York's political leaders have been at odds over how to take advantage of one of the best real estate deals ever offered. On a helicopter ride over New York Harbor in 1995, President Clinton spotted Governors Island, asked Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan about its history and then offered to return the 172-acre plot to New York State for the tidy sum of $1. The one catch, which turned out to be bigger than even the skeptics could have imagined at the time, was that New York City and New York State had to agree on a suitable way to use the island and protect its historic sites.</p>
        <p>To Senator Moynihan's personal frustration as he heads toward retirement, the dawdling among his colleagues has nearly pushed this delicious deal off the table. Questions of how the island would be managed and even who would share the credit for its return have apparently divided the state's politicians over the years. Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani seemed to come to a general agreement last January, and Senator Moynihan presented a bill last spring to effect the transfer. But since then there have been undercurrents of discord, not only between the governor and mayor, but also among various House members concerned about the island's transfer. A House bill was finally filed last week to match Senator Moynihan's.</p>

        <p>For five long years, New York's political leaders have been at odds over how to take advantage of one of the best real estate deals ever offered. On a helicopter ride over New York Harbor in 1995, President Clinton spotted Governors Island, asked Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan about its history and then offered to return the 172-acre plot to New York State for the tidy sum of $1. The one catch, which turned out to be bigger than even the skeptics could have imagined at the time, was that New York City and New York State had to agree on a suitable way to use the island and protect its historic sites.</p>
        <p>To Senator Moynihan's personal frustration as he heads toward retirement, the dawdling among his colleagues has nearly pushed this delicious deal off the table. Questions of how the island would be managed and even who would share the credit for its return have apparently divided the state's politicians over the years. Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani seemed to come to a general agreement last January, and Senator Moynihan presented a bill last spring to effect the transfer. But since then there have been undercurrents of discord, not only between the governor and mayor, but also among various House members concerned about the island's transfer. A House bill was finally filed last week to match Senator Moynihan's.</p>
        <p>Regrettably, the years of inaction have taken their toll. The island has turned into a pawn in the balanced-budget struggles in Washington. Three years ago, Congress estimated that a projected sale of the island could bring in revenues of up to $500 million. This tempting sum, a budget gimmick since reduced to $300 million, has nevertheless made it far more difficult for New Yorkers to argue that the island should be returned to the state for $1.</p>
        <p>The legislation now before Congress leaves only the two historic fortresses -- Castle Williams and Fort Jay -- as federal land, preserving them as national monuments. The rest of the island, which is a seven-minute ferry ride from Manhattan, would revert to the state and could then be developed, possibly in accord with preliminary plans for parks, tennis courts, museums, motels and a conference center, blissfully free of private automobiles.</p>
        <p>With only a few legislative working days remaining in this session, New York's political leaders must push Congress vigorously for the island's return. There are rumblings that Mayor Giuliani still has not signed off on all the details and that Congressional Republicans are not in the mood to do anything extra for New York this election year, but this bill deserves to pass. About 200 years ago, New York ceded Governors Island to the federal government to bolster American defenses. Now, the right thing to do is give it back.</p>
