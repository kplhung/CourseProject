        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>I've had the same neighbor, John Berman, for more than 20 years. I had come from the Midwest and an early experience I had with him changed some preconceptions I had of New Yorkers. At the time, because of very limited finances, I was unconcerned that my door had very flimsy locks. When I returned to my apartment one day I found I had been burglarized.  Nothing was taken, but the miscreant made a large hole through my wall and burglarized my more affluent neighbor, John.</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>I've had the same neighbor, John Berman, for more than 20 years. I had come from the Midwest and an early experience I had with him changed some preconceptions I had of New Yorkers. At the time, because of very limited finances, I was unconcerned that my door had very flimsy locks. When I returned to my apartment one day I found I had been burglarized.  Nothing was taken, but the miscreant made a large hole through my wall and burglarized my more affluent neighbor, John.</p>
        <p>When he returned that evening, I met him in the hall and explained what had happened. Nothing in his face, manner or speech showed any anger or blame toward me. I put up some cardboard to cover the hole. He never mentioned the event and refused to tell me what he had lost. But before the wall was repaired, I heard a tap on it, removed the cardboard and looked through. My neighbor was smiling and holding two cocktail glasses and a bottle of good wine. He filled the glasses, we clicked together and toasted through the hole in the wall. The cardboard went back (temporarily!) but I still recall the experience as an exceptional and gracious act of neighborliness.</p>

        <p>THE SIDE OF THE ANGELS</p>
        <p>New Yorkers are a varied bunch; each culture has its history</p>
        <p>of holidays and festivals that others find a mystery.</p>
        <p>But we share one rite in common that transcends potential strife</p>
        <p>And brings a welcome comfort to our quality of life.</p>
        <p>The rituals are easy; you can lie back and relax,</p>
        <p>have an extra cup of coffee or crawl back into the sack.</p>
        <p>Read the news a little longer, linger in the shower.</p>
        <p>Your fate, this morning, is in the hands of a somewhat higher power.</p>
        <p>Religious leaders in our town cannot help but agree</p>
        <p>that their faithful all are in the thrall of the mighty D.O.T.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the church or mosque or synagogue attended</p>
        <p>We're all united at the Shrine of the Alternate Side (Suspended).</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>During the United Nations summit conference, my husband and I were looking for a taxi on Second Avenue and 45th Street for what seemed like an eternity. While waiting, we chatted with a young police officer on duty. He suggested that we walk to Third Avenue, even though my husband has to use a cane. We followed his advice and halfway down the long block, I spotted a cab with its lights on and flagged it down. To our amazement, who should step out but the very same officer. He had hailed the cab and brought it around for us. Who says our police are not caring and considerate?</p>

        <p>Irving Shillman was chatting with the manager of his favorite East Side kosher delicatessen as he awaited his takeout order. He asked the manager if he knew a neighbor who had just had double bypass heart surgery. The manager, after trying to identify the neighbor and not succeeding, figured out why the man was unknown to him. ''He couldn't have been a very good customer,'' he said. ''Most of my people get quadruple and quintuple bypasses.''</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Michael Anton, a friend of mine, leapt onto a crowded subway train just before the doors slammed shut. As the train sat in the station, waiting for the congestion ahead to clear, he saw it. One of his beautiful new lined leather gloves had apparently fallen out of his pocket and was on the platform. What to do? There was no one left on the platform to pass it to him through a window. There was no conductor nearby to open the doors so he could retrieve it himself, and if he pulled the emergency cord, he would surely be arrested -- this couldn't be called an emergency. Sadly, he concluded that there was only one sensible thing to do. He leaned over to the open window and threw the other glove on the platform. At least someone would have a pair.</p>

        <p>One rainy day, vacationing in Vermont, Johanna Hurwitz went into an antiques/junk shop. There, among the old dishes, books, jewelry and pictures for sale, was a United States mailbox, the type on many street corners throughout New York City. The blue paint was slightly chipped and there was a bit of rust on it but it looked no worse than a number still in use. The sign on the box read: ''$90 -- Makes a great laundry hamper.'' She's pleased to know that even if the e-mail message completely replaces the written letter, greeting card and bill, the boxes may have a second life.</p>
        <p>AS TIME GOES BY</p>
        <p>Everyone shows us their grandchildren's photos,</p>
        <p>''How cute, like angels,'' we fuss.</p>
        <p>Then something happens in the interim years:</p>
        <p>They all grow up to be us.</p>

        <p>Scene: Madison Avenue bus at 8 a.m.</p>
        <p>Observer: Lisa Stillman.</p>
        <p>Participants: Two boys in private-school uniforms, one quizzing the other about which Hampton he had vacationed in, how big the house was and whether the family rented or owned -- both boys sounding more like 30ish bankers than 10-year-olds. Finally, the ubiquitous Hamptons real estate question:</p>
        <p>''Were you north or south of the highway?'' one asked.</p>
        <p>''South,'' said his companion.</p>
        <p>The other boy was suddenly confused, once again sounding his age. ''I don't remember,'' he said. ''Is that supposed to be good or not?''</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>I was on a crowded express train one late afternoon, a white-haired elderly woman holding onto a pole for stability. Sitting in front of me was a young woman, perhaps 25. She was looking into my face but was clearly a million miles away. Suddenly, she really looked at me and cried out: ''Oh, I'm so sorry. What could I have been thinking? How thoughtless of me. Please sit down.'' She began to stand up but I said I was getting off at the next stop and thanked her for the offer. Before I got off, I bent down and told her she was an anachronism. She replied that she was proud to be an anachronism. ''You know what?'' she said, ''I just looked that word up a few weeks ago.''</p>
