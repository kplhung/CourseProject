        <p>Australian athletes will not begin competing in Sydney until Saturday, but two Olympic competitions that matter a great deal to their country will be decided before the first ball is struck or the first wall is touched.</p>
        <p>The questions, in order of importance to Australians:</p>
        <p>Who will light the Olympic caldron during the opening ceremony on Friday? Who will carry the Australian flag during the procession of nations?</p>
        <p>The two people responsible for choosing this year's caldron lighter -- John Coates, the Australian Olympic committee president, and Michael Knight, the Olympics minister -- know it will be hard to match the emotional impact that Muhammad Ali had in lighting the caldron in Atlanta at the 1996 Games.</p>
        <p>The conventional wisdom is that Coates and Knight will pick one of two Australian women who excelled when Australia was last host to the Games in 1956 in Melbourne, Dawn Fraser or Betty Cuthbert.</p>
        <p>Fraser was recently voted the most outstanding female swimmer of the 20th century. She won the 100-meter freestyle in three consecutive Olympics, beginning in 1956. Cuthbert won three gold medals in 1956 -- in the 100- and 200-meter sprints, and in the 4x100 relay -- and then won the 400 gold in 1964. Now confined to a wheelchair because of multiple sclerosis, she would be, like Fraser, a straightforward, popular choice.</p>
        <p>Coates will also select which current Olympian will carry the Australian flag. The front-runners are the runner Cathy Freeman and the swimmer Kieren Perkins. Freeman, the two-time world 400-meter champion, is an Aborigine and the most admired woman in Australia, according to recent polls. Perkins has won two individual Olympic gold medals and will try to win the 1,500-meter freestyle for the third consecutive time in an Olympics.</p>
        <p>Coates is scheduled to announce his decision on Tuesday.</p>
