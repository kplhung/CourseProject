        <p>LONG AFTER the Canadian James Naismith dreamed up a winter-time diversion called basketball, the Europeans went to work codifying another winter-time diversion. Initially an 11-on-11 outdoor game like soccer, team handball was first played at the Olympics in 1936 in Berlin at the Germans' request.</p>
        <p>By the time it returned to the Olympics in the 1972 Munich Games, it had moved indoors and become a seven-on-seven affair. So it has remained, and though it is still a relatively popular sport in Europe, this routinely spectacular game has the lowest of profiles on this side of the Atlantic (NBC will not be getting up close and personal with the handball players).</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- As in Atlanta, there are 12 men's teams in the field, but the women's field has been increased from eight to 10. A quarterfinal round has been added in both tournaments, which means that the top four teams in each pool will advance. This also means pool play counts for little, particularly in the case of the women (only two teams will be eliminated).</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- An amalgam of indoor soccer and basketball, goals are scored in team handball by players throwing a relatively small ball into a 3 meter-by-2 meter goal minded by a goalkeeper. Team handball is much more high-scoring than soccer; much more low-scoring than basketball. Croatia beat Sweden, 27-26, in the last Olympic men's final; Denmark beat South Korea, 37-33, in the women's final. No Americans will be scoring in Sydney: neither the American men nor the American women qualified.</p>
