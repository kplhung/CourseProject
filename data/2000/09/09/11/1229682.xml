        <p>THIS HAS BEEN a big Olympic sport for the United States, especially in the men's eight-oared competition. This time, the United States is the only nation to have qualified in all 14 events (six for women), and it ranks behind Germany and Romania among the team favorites.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- The 550 rowers will compete in eight sculling events (two oars for each sculler) ranging from singles to quads and six sweep events (one oar per athlete) ranging from pairs to eights. The races include two lightweight events for men (160-pound limit per man) and one for women (130-pound limit per woman).</p>

        <p>THIS HAS BEEN a big Olympic sport for the United States, especially in the men's eight-oared competition. This time, the United States is the only nation to have qualified in all 14 events (six for women), and it ranks behind Germany and Romania among the team favorites.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- The 550 rowers will compete in eight sculling events (two oars for each sculler) ranging from singles to quads and six sweep events (one oar per athlete) ranging from pairs to eights. The races include two lightweight events for men (160-pound limit per man) and one for women (130-pound limit per woman).</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- The heats are unseeded and based on a random draw, and usually only heat winners advance to a semifinal or final. First-round losers get a second chance in a repechage round.</p>
        <p>All races are over a 2,000-meter straightaway.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- For the favorites, strategy varies from race to race. Faster strokes are often better, but seasoned crews can win or stay competitive with fewer but more efficient strokes and high-speed spurts.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- The favorites in the glamour races, the eight-oared sweeps, are the United States men and Romanian women, with the American women's eight a strong contender.</p>
        <p>Steve Redgrave, a 38-year-old Briton in the fours without coxswain, will try to become the second summer or winter Olympian to win gold medals in five consecutive Olympics (Aladar Gerevich, a Hungarian fencer, won six in a row from 1932 through 1960).</p>
