        <p>For years, the American Booksellers Association has filed lawsuits asserting that large bookstore chains are driving independent stores out of business. Now, shifting tactics, the association is trumpeting what it says is a comeback at some independents.</p>
        <p>In an effort to promote its own Booksense program, a coordinated national marketing campaign by 1,100 stores begun in June 1999, the association will announce this week results of a sales survey from 260 participating stores.</p>
        <p>''In an environment where independent store sales have been decreasing, these stores in our Booksense program are doing better,'' said Oren Teicher, chief operating officer of the association, a trade group representing 3,000 privately owned bookstores that is the only source of the survey results.</p>
        <p>About half the 260 stores reported a rise of more than 10 percent from 1998 to 1999, the organization said. That exceeds the growth of less than 6 percent in total sales of trade books. Independent bookstores' total share of the book market, however, continued to fall, to 15.2 percent in 1999 from 16.6 percent.</p>
        <p>For the first half of this year, more than 40 percent of the 260 stores recorded sales more than 10 percent higher than in the period a year earlier, while just one in 10 stores reported declining sales.</p>
        <p>But others in the industry were skeptical that Booksense could account for the gains. The program includes marketing materials, lists of other booksellers' recommended books, a best-seller list from 350 stores and a small national advertising campaign.</p>
        <p>''I have never heard anyone outside the book business mention it,'' said Karen Jenkins Holt, editor of the newsletter, Book Publishing Report.</p>
        <p>Some bookstores, however, were enthusiastic. ''It is the most positive initiative that the A.B.A. has ever undertaken,'' said Audrey Seitz, vice president for marketing at Joseph-Beth's bookstore in Cincinnati. She said her customers appreciated seeing recommendations from well-known bookstores like A Clean Well-Lighted Place in San Francisco.</p>
