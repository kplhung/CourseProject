        <p>A former United States Customs officer has confessed to forging a memo that was submitted and used in a ''60 Minutes'' segment as proof of corruption along the Southwest border by the United States Customs Service in San Diego.</p>
        <p>Michael L. Horner, 47, who left the Customs Service in 1992, pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in San Diego to conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and to making false statements to F.B.I. agents who were investigating the source of the memo.</p>

        <p>A former United States Customs officer has confessed to forging a memo that was submitted and used in a ''60 Minutes'' segment as proof of corruption along the Southwest border by the United States Customs Service in San Diego.</p>
        <p>Michael L. Horner, 47, who left the Customs Service in 1992, pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in San Diego to conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and to making false statements to F.B.I. agents who were investigating the source of the memo.</p>
        <p>The false memo, which was doctored to appear authentic and purported to be from Rudy M. Camacho, the director of the Customs Management Center in San Diego at the time, instructed customs personnel to give preferential inspection treatment to a certain trucking company that had been rumored to be affiliated with Mexican drug dealers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Horner then sent a fax of the document to Lee Zeidman, a ''60 Minutes'' producer, and it was included in a Mike Wallace report that was broadcast on April 20, 1997, to support arguments that the Southwest border is easily bypassed by large drug cargos.</p>
