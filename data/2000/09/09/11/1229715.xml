        <p>THE Americans will be looking for signs of a rebirth. In the mid- and late-80's, the Americans were led by Karch Kiraly, a young player from Southern California. In 1984 and 1988, Kiraly helped the United States win consecutive gold medals. Then he started to hit the beach looking for competition, and, perhaps coincidentally, the United States slowly lost control of the sport to teams like Italy.</p>
        <p>In 1996, the men's team did not even place among the top eight. The women had fleeting success with a silver in 1984, but have been overcome lately by teams from Cuba, Russia, China and Brazil.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- The men's and women's competition will consist of 12 teams: the top 3 teams from the most recent World Cup, 5 winners of regional tournaments, 3 teams from Olympic qualifying and the host nation. Two pools of six teams will compete in a round-robin format. The top four teams in each pool advance to the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>The new rules are intended to make volleyball more intense and television friendly. In 1996, indoor volleyball was almost forgotten in the hype that swirled around the debut of beach volleyball. But now, there are new rules.</p>
        <p>For the first time, the defense can score, which raises the intensity and puts more impact on each rally. There is also a defensive specialist allowed on the floor, and that person will wear a different-color jersey. The hope is the rule changes will increase the flow of the game.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- The scoring has also been tinkered with beyond the elimination of the old side-out format. In the first four sets, athletes now play to 25 points, while the final set still goes to 15 points. The set must still be won by 2 points, with no ceiling to the score.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- The addition of a defensive specialist gives teams a rover. The rover can be anywhere in the backcourt but cannot serve, spike or rotate in the front zone. A good specialist can give a team a lift in rallies and more agility on defense.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- The Cuban women's team, led by Mireya Luis and Magalys Carrajal, is the two-time defending Olympic champion. It is the team to beat, with Russia, China and Brazil in contention.</p>
        <p>Although they do not appear to be in the chase for a medal, Tara Cross-Battle and Logan Tom will lead the American women.</p>
        <p>For the men, the countries with developed domestic pro leagues should dominate. Italy, the Netherlands and Cuba are all in pursuit of the gold medal. For the American men to succeed, they will need great performances from the remains of the 1996 team and newcomers like George Roumain.</p>
        <p>BEACH VOLLEYBALL -- The site of the competition -- the glitzy Bondi Beach -- has been almost as big a story as the event. That is hard to pull off. In its second Olympics, beach volleyball's sex appeal has made it one of the most popular new sports at the Games.</p>
        <p>The tournament has a double-elimination format. Unlike indoor volleyball, there are just two players on a team and points are scored only by the serving team. The first team to score 15 points wins. In the medal round, the first team to score 12 points wins, and in the third set, a point is scored for every rally regardless of who is serving.</p>
        <p>Kiraly, the player whose name became synonymous with beach volleyball, separated his shoulder trying to earn a berth on the team.</p>
        <p>Without Kiraly, the Americans will try to hold off the Brazilians and the Aussies with the team of Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana.</p>
        <p>The American women will be led by the combination of Misty May and Holly McPeak. Once again, the Australians, playing on their home sand and led by Kerri Potthorst and Natalie Cook, should be inspired playing in front of their countrymen. Brazil will also pose a threat.</p>
