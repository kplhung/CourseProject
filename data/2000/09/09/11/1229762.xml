        <p>British troops today made a surprise dawn attack on the jungle base of a renegade guerrilla gang in Sierra Leone and in a 90-minute gun battle freed seven soldiers who had been taken hostage there last month, the Ministry of Defense said.</p>
        <p>One British serviceman died, another was seriously wounded and 11 others suffered light injuries in the rescue.</p>
        <p>The battle began after after 150 paratroopers on military helicopters swooped in on the camp, which is located on a river in a lowland area of dense vegetation and swamp 50 miles east of Freetown, the capital.</p>
        <p>Twenty-five members of the small rebel militia group, known as The West Side Boys, were killed, and 18, including their leader, Foday Kallay, were captured and turned over to the Sierra Leone government, British officials said.</p>
        <p>The hostages freed from their mud and bamboo prison hut -- six of them British and the other from Sierra Leone -- were flown to the British naval vessel Sir Percivale, a logistic support ship anchored in Freetown harbor. They were reported by their commanding officer, Col. Simon Fordham, to be ''mentally and physically exhausted'' but unharmed.</p>
        <p>Sir Charles Guthrie, the general who is Chief of the Defense Staff, said at a news conference in London  that the decision to carry out the high-risk military action was made after the rebel leaders' demands mounted dramatically and the lives of the hostages were thought to be in danger.</p>
        <p>During 16 days of talks, the British expressed public optimism about a happy outcome of the negotiations, but Sir Charles said today that the talks in fact ''were getting nowhere.''</p>
        <p>He said the rebels staged ''mock executions'' and talked of plans to move their captives to hidden spots deeper into the jungle. He explained that the British had ''painstakingly'' mapped the location where the captives were being held and did not want to chance losing all contact.</p>
        <p>The British hostages were part of the team of army trainers in Sierra Leone to rebuild the country's defense forces, which have been shattered in a ruthless war that has been going on continually for nearly a decade.</p>
        <p>Three of the rebels who died in the raid were women, who Sir Charles said had been fighting alongside the men. ''The West Side Boys were not a pushover -- they fought very hard,'' Sir Charles said.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair was briefed on the operation while at the official Chequers weekend retreat in Buckinghamshire and later spoke to reporters outside 10 Downing Street.</p>
        <p>''This was an operation carried out in circumstances of immense danger, in the face of armed resistance,'' he said. ''Inevitably,'' he added grimly, ''in such an operation as this, there are casualties.''</p>
        <p>The hostages were taken on Aug. 25 in a rebel stronghold region outside the assigned responsibility for British patrols. Critics of the British military presence in the war-torn West African nation have noted the detail but have not made much of it yet out of concern for the delicate ongoing negotiations.</p>
        <p>There were originally a dozen captives, but five of them were released last week in exchange for a satellite phone that the militia leaders then used to press their escalating demands.</p>
        <p>Fighters from the country's main rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front, are responsible for killing or mutilating of tens of thousands of civilians in a war that has caused particular horror because of their widespread practice of hacking off the arms of victims, many of them small children. In May, 10 months after signing a peace accord and gaining a role in governing Sierra Leone, they started up their war again, seizing hundreds of United Nations peacekeepers and attacking defenseless towns in the interior.</p>
        <p>The West Side Boys are an undisciplined gang that has fought both the government and the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front. Their demands for releasing their hostages in recent days included admission to the regular government army, new military equipment for their own forces, the setting up of their own interim regime and safe passage from Sierra Leone to a place where they could receive a university education.</p>
        <p>The second-in-command of the freed hostages' battalion, Maj. John Douglas, said tonight that the joy at news of the successful rescue had been overtaken by ''the devastation that anybody should be hurt in this operation.''</p>
        <p>The British soldier who died in the rescue had not been publicly identified by late tonight, but Major Douglas said, ''Because we have been so closely involved with our families and the emotional trauma they have been going through, I think we can start to understand the loss the family is suffering at the moment.''</p>
