        <p>IN the current climate for technology stocks, it is not surprising that the troubles plaguing other sectors of the industry have now fallen on the consulting companies that help businesses build and manage their Internet operations. What is remarkable, though, is how quickly the pall has descended.</p>
        <p>Over the last two weeks, several leading Internet consulting companies have announced negative news, starting a downturn in much of the sector. Viant and iXL Enterprises, which had previously been profitable, both announced they would post a loss for the third quarter, with revenue falling short of the record results each had in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Organic announced smaller-than-anticipated revenue growth and iXL Enterprises said it would lay off several hundred employees.</p>
        <p>This reversal in a sector previously characterized by double-digit revenue growth each quarter sent share prices tumbling, with the sector down overall 15 percent since Aug. 29. Although the spill can primarily be attributed to the misfortunes of the consulting companies' dot-com clients, the pace of the change also says that an industry that operates on the vaunted 24/7 pace  can also implode at Internet speed.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the backlash in the services sector was foreshadowed in late June, when Banc of America Securities downgraded the consulting firm Scient from ''buy'' to a ''market performer'' after two of Scient's clients filed for bankruptcy. The drop showed that Scient, based in San Francisco, and its competitors were vulnerable to the shifting fortunes of their dot-com clients. Scient's stock has fallen to $27, down from a 52-week high of $133.75 in March.</p>
        <p>But the sector's real trouble became evident late last month when the bad news really began piling up. On Aug. 31, Viant, a previously profitable Internet consulting company in Boston, announced that it would post a loss for the third quarter and that revenue would be as much as 15 percent below its second-quarter sales of $38.5 million.</p>
        <p>A day later, Atlanta-based iXL Enterprises issued a similar warning, predicting a loss in the third quarter and revenue as much as 20 percent below the $119.2 million revenue of the second quarter.</p>
        <p>IXL has since announced a management overhaul and plans to lay off 350 employees.</p>
        <p>And then San Francisco-based Organic Inc. announced last Wednesday that because of smaller-than-expected anticipated revenue growth, the company would not reach its goal of profitability in the third quarter -- although Organic does expect to increase revenue 5 percent over its $37.2 million in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>The market's reaction to these announcements was unforgiving. Viant's stock closed on Friday at $7.53, down from a 52-week high of $63.56. iXL closed at $6.44, down from a high of $58.75, and Organic dropped to $4.53, from its 52-week high of $60.</p>
        <p>Mark Wolfenberger, senior information technology services analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said analysts had downgraded the stocks of about a third of the Internet consulting companies they cover, anticipating a period of retrenchment and ultimately, consolidation. Among the companies that have been downgraded by Credit Suisse are Viant, Rare Medium, Modem Media, Cambridge Technology Partners and iGate.</p>
        <p>''The opinion on the group in the past five days has gone from optimistically positive to downright negative,'' Mr. Wolfenberger said in an interview last Thursday.</p>
        <p>The main reason for the gloomy outlook is a shift in the demand for the services these companies provide. While the consulting companies feasted on business from cash-rich start-ups and the brick-and-mortar companies that tried to keep pace, the dot-com shakeout has meant even old-economy  companies feel less urgency to develop their Internet strategies.</p>
        <p>''I think that the consulting companies got the sense that life was going to continue in the passing lane, traveling at 85 miles an hour,'' Mr. Wolfenberger said. ''We've moved from 85 miles an hour back into the right-hand lane at 60 miles per hour.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfenberger underscored that there was still plenty of demand for Internet consulting services. Forrester Research, for example, estimates the United States market for e-commerce services will reach $64.8 billion by 2003, up from an estimated $19.6 billion this year.</p>
        <p>But as consulting firms shift their focus from working primarily with start-ups to serving more traditional clients, they need to be able to handle projects far more complex than merely getting first-time Web sites up and running. The tougher tasks include integrating a company's Web site with its existing systems, like inventory management software or customer databases. Such projects tend to require more complicated technology, as well as longer sales cycles.</p>
        <p>Stephen Mucchetti, president and chief operating officer of Scient, which had 60 active clients as of last quarter, said that although the company was still working with venture-backed start-ups, it was increasingly focusing on traditional corporations, including AT&amp;T, Chase Manhattan and the cosmetics retailer Sephora.</p>
        <p>''The Internet-driven side of this is gone now,'' he said. ''The next phase is this integrated virtual and physical business.''</p>
        <p>In that respect, Internet services firms like Scient and Viant may be more vulnerable to competition from seasoned information-technology consultants like I.B.M. Services, Deloitte Consulting and KPMG Consulting, which already have relationships with many of the world's biggest companies and have been ramping up their Internet services to compete with the newer players.</p>
        <p>Bob Gett, the chief executive of Viant, said that even though his company had been expecting a shift in the market, it came so suddenly that Viant had not had time to react to the changing nature of the demand.</p>
        <p>''I think what caught everybody by surprise is the rate at which it happened,'' he said. ''Welcome to the new economy.''</p>
