        <p>THE FORTUNE TELLERS  Inside Wall Street's Game of Money, Media and Manipulation  By Howard Kurtz  326 pages. Free Press. $26.</p>
        <p>Midway through ''The Fortune Tellers,'' the journalist Howard Kurtz tells the story of Lou Dobbs's resignation as president of the Cable News Network's financial division and from his post as anchor of ''Moneyline.'' Mr. Kurtz writes of the mood inside CNN:</p>
        <p>''The staff is still shell-shocked. Could 'Moneyline' succeed without Lou Dobbs? Would CNNfn survive without Lou Dobbs?''</p>
        <p>If you care deeply about the answers to those questions, Mr. Kurtz's indefatigable, gossipy, punchily written examination of Wall Street and the press may well be the book for you. It is assiduously reported, wide ranging, full of insider stories about the superheated world of the stock market in the late 1990's and the traders, television analysts and journalists who made highly visible careers in it.</p>
        <p>If, on the other hand, you feel that the departure of Mr. Dobbs was actually an event of relatively minor historical interest, you will probably find that Mr. Kurtz fills his book with a kind of movie-music portent -- the use of that expression ''shell-shocked'' is one of many examples -- that seem an attempt to cover over the essentially repetitive, even monotonous quality to his story.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurtz, who is the media reporter of The Washington Post, begins ''The Fortune Tellers'' with a promise to disclose the worrisome closeness of journalists and the businessmen they cover and thereby to show the corruption in a system that has given them such remarkable power to influence the very market in which many of them have invested their money and their clients' money. ''In the business arena,'' Mr. Kurtz asserts, ''financial journalists are players.''</p>
        <p>But he never manages to give much shape to the many stories he tells. His book is loaded with people and events, with numerous rises and declines of the stock market, with the career machinations and the intense emotional lives of the many players who tramp through its pages. But it is written in a cliche-encrusted sort of stock-marketese, Mr. Kurtz having confounded the verbal style of his subjects with effective, lively narrative prose.</p>
        <p>His main subject is the emergence in the second half of the 1990's of a new form of business news, on cable television and the Internet, that tracked the technology boom for a growing audience of investors. Among the most visible figures here are Jim Cramer, founder of TheStreet.com (an Internet business information service) and a leading hedge-fund manager, and Maria Bartiromo, the best-known reporter on CNBC. Accompanying them are a dozen or so others, especially the stock market analysts who speak on the financial news networks, chief among them Ralph Acampora of Prudential Securities, the major ''fortune teller'' of Mr. Kurtz's title. We follow their careers, their quarrels, their reconstituted shouting matches and their intense quotidian anxieties.</p>
        <p>Along the way Mr. Kurtz provides some insights into the changes in the culture that they have wrought. He describes, for example, the emergence of the chief executive officer as a kind of cult figure, ''a new form of celebrity,'' whose skills at being interviewed on CNNfn and CNBC correlate directly with the stock performance of his company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cramer is the strongest and most interesting character in this story, an illustration of his generation of ambitious young people who understood the new economy early on and were able to exploit it to enormous personal benefit. Mr. Kurtz presents him as a stormy, quarrelsome, passionate figure and an unusual one in his ability to combine journalism with investing.</p>
        <p>But even if Mr. Cramer is an interesting, and even iconic figure, neither he nor the other media stock pickers that Mr. Kurtz covers seem to substantiate the overall thesis of this book, namely that ''in an age of lightning-quick Internet reports, saturation cable coverage and jittery day traders, moving the market is a remarkably easy thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Again and again Mr. Kurtz shows the market moving contrary to the predictions of the most visible television reporters and analysts. He allows that ''the stock market moves in unpredictable ways.'' Well, is the market remarkably easy to move or almost impossible to predict? Mr. Kurtz gives us a great heap of events and personalities, but he does not sort very carefully through his own material for some clear conclusions.</p>
        <p>In any case Mr. Kurtz's book is heavier on media-financial world gossip than it is on sea changes in the culture or on journalistic ethics. Many passages read more like those articles about some celebrity's emotional life common to People magazine than they do like the serious business reporting of, say, The Wall Street Journal or The Washington Post. Mr. Kurtz reports that Mr. Cramer ''winces'' at a bad report; he ''grumbles''; he is ''mad''; he ''barks''; he is ''bitter''; he is ''totally stressed out.'' Who cares? one wants to ask.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurtz leaps from subject to subject. Here is a segment evoking suspense on the trading floor as the Dow flirts with 10,000 (and then flirts with 10,000 again and yet again). There is a comment on Ms. Bartiromo, showing how ''truly awkward'' (as opposed, supposedly, to falsely awkward) it was that she was on her honeymoon just as CNBC was reacting to the resignation of Mr. Dobbs. Then we have a few paragraphs on the ups and downs of the Internet company Doubleclick interspersed with scenes of Mr. Cramer selling, worrying, buying, selling again.</p>
        <p>This narrative approach not only fails to pick up much thematic momentum but makes for a self-consciously hip sort of prose that is simply not worthy of a journalist of Mr. Kurtz's stature. In this book stocks don't go down in price; they ''tank''; nobody sells stock; they ''blow out'' their shares. People aren't confused; they are ''out to lunch,'' or they are hoping to ''kick some butt in the business world,'' or they see ''an opening big enough to drive a truck through.''</p>
        <p>This reliance on formula, on a basket of cliches, is an unliterary straining for effect, and, like most straining for effect, it shows an author lacking confidence in his material, uncertain of its ability to demonstrate importance and interest on its own.</p>
