        <p>NOBODY looking over the paraphernalia that fills  Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr.'s office would ever question his political loyalties.

There are photos of Mr. Fahrenkopf with Mr. Reagan aboard Air Force One, outside the Oval Office and at the lectern of the Republican National Convention. There is nary a Democrat in sight.</p>
        <p>But some Republicans are questioning Mr. Fahrenkopf's allegiance these days.

        <p>NOBODY looking over the paraphernalia that fills  Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr.'s office would ever question his political loyalties. The place is stocked with mementos from his time as chairman of the Republican National Committee during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. There are photos of Mr. Fahrenkopf with Mr. Reagan aboard Air Force One, outside the Oval Office and at the lectern of the Republican National Convention. There is nary a Democrat in sight.</p>
        <p>But some Republicans are questioning Mr. Fahrenkopf's allegiance these days. Besides his role as a party elder and his day job as president of the American Gaming Association, the trade group of the casino industry, Mr. Fahrenkopf is co-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates. That is the bipartisan group that the Republican presidential candidate, George W. Bush of Texas, snubbed by proposing to skip two of the three commission-organized debates.</p>
        <p>''This is a partisan town, and there are people who throw arrows,'' Mr. Fahrenkopf said with a shrug of the sniping from Republican circles. ''I have no doubt there were some choice words used in connection with my name in Austin over the last few weeks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fahrenkopf has urged the campaign to reconsider its decision to avoid the commission's debates, and he is optimistic that a deal will eventually be reached. On Friday, Mr. Bush's campaign appeared to be relenting, and the Bush and Gore camps are expected to meet with the commission's staff later this week.</p>
        <p>''I felt that the campaign was making a mistake,'' Mr. Fahrenkopf said in an interview  Friday. ''These are two candidates with very different views and that's what they should be focusing on,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''The most useful thing Fahrenkopf could do is step down,'' said a Bush adviser, who spoke Friday only on the condition that he not be identified by name. ''He's giving this commission an air of legitimacy. These debates should be done the old-fashioned way with negotiators for the two campaigns yelling and screaming and clawing at each other for a while and then reaching a deal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fahrenkopf founded the nonpartisan debate commission in 1987 with Paul G. Kirk Jr., who was chairman of the Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>''People get buried with one-sided mailings that come to their house, one-sided ads in newspapers, 15- and 30-second slanted attack ads on television,'' Mr. Fahrenkopf said. ''Really, the only time where you really see the candidates are during debates. They stand there unvarnished before the American people. We want the guy sitting at home to really see their demeanor, their rationale, and learn more about them.''</p>
        <p>Now, grumbling about the debate commission has become an integral part of the quadrennial process of picking a president. The only thing that seems to change is which candidate is resisting the commission, and which party's  co-chairman on the commission finds himself butting heads with members of his own party.</p>
        <p>In 1996, Mr. Kirk clashed with President Clinton's re-election campaign, trying in vain to get the president to participate in all four commission-sponsored debates. Mr. Clinton took part in only three. Four years earlier, Mr. Clinton agreed to the commission's debates but Mr. Fahrenkopf had to lobby hard to get then-President Bush to participate. Eventually, the president agreed.</p>
        <p>A COLLEGE debater himself, Mr. Fahrenkopf has been involved in politics since the 1960's, when he attended law school at the University of California at Berkeley. He helped increase the membership of the Nevada Young Republican Club to more than 500 people from half a dozen. His father, an auto mechanic, was a Democrat but Mr. Fahrenkopf, who is 61, said he has always been a Republican.</p>
        <p>He became the youngest state chairman in the country in 1975, representing his native Nevada, and was tapped by Mr. Reagan to head the R.N.C. in 1982. Mr. Fahrenkopf served six years, the longest tenure of any major party chairman this century.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fahrenkopf calls himself a ''political animal,'' but he says he and Mr. Kirk have reduced their political activities as they have established the debate commission.</p>
        <p>Putting together the debates is a complicated exercise that starts well before the political parties pick their nominees. Inevitably, there are challenges from third-party candidates eager to share the stage. And settling on dates that do not conflict with major sporting events can be a headache.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fahrenkopf does not buy the conventional wisdom that Mr. Bush will perform better if he confronts Mr. Gore across a television newsman's desk instead of in a traditional behind-the-lectern debate. Mr. Fahrenkopf argues that a variety of formats serves the public best.</p>
        <p>''Bush stood toe to toe behind podiums with Ann Richards, the then-governor of Texas, and wiped the floor with her,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Likewise,'' he added, ''the mini-debate between Ross Perot and Al Gore took place on the Larry King show, and Al Gore was very, very good in that debate.''</p>
