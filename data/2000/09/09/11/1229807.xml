        <p>Pete Sampras ducked into the tunnel and shuffled toward the locker room, his racket bag slung over his left shoulder. His left hand cradled an envelope and an odd two-dimensional silver plate that reflected a face resigned to his fate.</p>
        <p>Usually, Sampras needs two hands to carry his prize.</p>
        <p>But this was a different day entirely, when his drop shots, backhand returns and rocket serves rarely worked against the brazen 20-year-old star Marat Safin, who handcuffed Sampras yesterday afternoon to run away with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 victory in the final of the United States Open.</p>
        <p>Nothing seemed as it was 10 years ago when Sampras was the one winning his first Grand Slam title at the Open, nor was it like two months ago when he captured his record-setting 13th Grand Slam singles title in the magical twilight of Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>Instead, it was as if Sampras, 29 and about to be married, was a detached witness to his own destruction, able to walk away afterward toward the new life he has built, content with his place in history.</p>
        <p>''I'm disappointed, but I'm not going to break my rackets, I'm not going to lose it emotionally,'' Sampras said. ''But if I lost, 7-6, in the third, had match points, I'd be in a different mood.</p>
        <p>''It was a tough loss. I've got to accept it. I lost to a better player on this day.''</p>
        <p>Sampras lost for only the third time in 16 Grand Slam finals, and the first time in eight Grand Slam finals dating back to his 1995 four-set loss to Andre Agassi at the Australian Open. But it was the first time he lost a Grand Slam final in straight sets.</p>
        <p>Sampras had lost just one set this tournament before yesterday. ''It hasn't happened very often that I've been on the other end of a barrage of shots like that,'' Sampras said. ''I'm usually the one that's doing that.''</p>
        <p>Sampras's dominating beginning was a false portent. He opened the match with a 131 mile-an-hour ace, and three service winners later he had a 1-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Safin broke him in the seventh game, though, returning Sampras's 125-m.p.h. serve with a forehand passing shot winner that cemented Sampras to the court. Sampras at first thought his serve caught the net, but he was denied.</p>
        <p>''Just kind of a sign of how the day was going to go,'' Sampras said with a sigh. ''I wasn't on top of my game, but he had a lot to do with it.''</p>
        <p>The second game of the second set showed that. Sampras hit what seemed to be a backhand drop shot winner. But while he was admiring the shot, the 6-foot-4-inch Safin tracked it down, angling a backhand winner. Sampras came to the net 82 times, but won just 52 percent of those attempts, Safin whipping passing shots by him as if he were a spectator.</p>
        <p>After Safin broke him again at 4-3, the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd began chanting, ''Let's go, Pete! Let's go, Pete!'' to incite the four-time United States Open champion as much as to quiet their own disbelief.</p>
        <p>''They were just waiting to explode,'' Sampras said. ''I was doing the best I could to give them something to cheer about. Any time I had a chance, he came up with some big serves.''</p>
        <p>Sampras connected on just 52 percent of his first serves in the second set and began to hang his head and slump his shoulders. After losing the first set to Richard Krajicek in the quarterfinals, Sampras rallied at the right times.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, he had no response.</p>
        <p>''After he lost the first two, it was as if the wind came out of his sails,'' said his coach, Paul Annacone. Sampras had just two break points the entire match and they came in the final game. By then, it was too late.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to say it's a changing of the guard,'' Sampras said of the Russian's second victory over him. ''It's a huge win for him, but I'll be back.''</p>
        <p>Eight years ago, such a Grand Slam loss would have destroyed him. Sampras brought up his lackluster 1992 United States Open loss to Stefan Edberg as the one that changed his career, but nothing can affect him that way again. ''I can honestly sit here and say I just got outplayed,'' he said. ''I've got some important dates in my future this year, getting married, which is obviously a big step in my life.''</p>
        <p>He will return to No. 1 in the ranking because of his appearance in the final, but Sampras was unconcerned about numbers. ''I got what I wanted this year, that was the record and Wimbledon, which was nice,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, Sampras walked out of the interview room and went to find Annacone, some friends, and his fiancee, Bridgette Wilson, in the referees' lounge. He was smiling as he walked, reaching for some hard candy on a desk. Just another day.</p>
