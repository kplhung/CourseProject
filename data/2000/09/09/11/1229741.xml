        <p>In documents that are expected to be shown to shareholders on Monday, OM Gruppen will offer details to support its hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange and say why its plan would make more sense than a friendly merger with the Frankfurt stock exchange, people close to the matter say.</p>
        <p>The publication of these documents is expected to set off a new round of dealing in the increasingly bitter battle for the London exchange. What started as a friendly merger between London and Frankfurt to form a joint exchange called iX has degenerated into a melee among competing interests. As criticism for iX mounts, Don Cruickshank's future as chairman of the London exchange hangs in the balance.</p>
        <p>Two shareholders -- Brian Winterflood, the founder of Winterflood Securities, and Michael Spencer, the chief executive of Garban Intercapital, the London exchange's fourth-largest shareholder -- are calling for Mr. Cruickshank's dismissal when investors gather on Sept. 14 for what will be the first annual meeting since the exchange went public.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Cruickshank is respected for his work as a managing director at Virgin Group and at the telecommunications regulatory agency in Britain, Oftel, he lacks the skills to shepherd a public company through a takeover battle, his critics say.</p>
        <p>IX faced its biggest setback last week after the leak of a highly critical internal report on the plan from Merrill Lynch, which has been advising the London exchange on the merger. Merrill Lynch said it prepared the report as a routine course of business to explain the effect of the merger to its customers.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Borse's supervisory committee is scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss the possibility of postponing its Sept. 14 shareholder vote on iX. A vote in London has been indefinitely delayed in light of OM Gruppen's hostile bid.</p>
        <p>Waning support for iX comes as OM goes on the offensive. The Swedish group, which runs the Stockholm stock exchange, has set up meetings with shareholders in an effort to convince them that its plan is superior to a deal with Frankfurt.</p>
        <p>One of the major differences between the two plans is that OM would rely on integrated clearing and settlement to lower costs, while a London-Frankfurt venture would try to increase liquidity to achieve the same result.</p>
        <p>OM's ''vertical'' model has been endorsed by the Center for the Study of Financial Innovation, a group financed by several British banks. The center said in a report that ''the best model for a European equity market is a unified system of clearing and settlement.''</p>
        <p>Under the ''horizontal'' iX plan, the clearing and settlement houses of London and Frankfurt would remain separate, although they have proposed a plan that could reduce costs on international trades by as much as 90 percent.</p>
        <p>OM is not expected to raise its offer price now, although an increased bid is likely in the coming weeks, people close to the process said. The cash-and-stock offer values the London exchange at $:839.34 million ($1.2 billion), or $:28.26 a share, based on Friday's closing price. Last week, the bid dipped below the share price of the London exchange for the first time. On Friday, shares of the exchange closed at $:29.25.</p>
        <p>The London exchange has 14 days to respond to OM's offer. Other interested parties have just more than a month to file bids. Euronext, an alliance of the Paris, Belgian and Dutch exchanges, has spoken with BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and ABN Amro about financing a bid, and Deutsche Borse could come back with a sweetened offer. Nasdaq, which has a nonbinding deal to join iX, remains a wild card.</p>
