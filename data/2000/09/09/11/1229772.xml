        <p>After a year of further excavations at the Valley of the Golden Mummies, Egyptian archaeologists have opened seven more tombs and found 102 more mummies, including members of elite and middle-class families and a woman with a wooden tablet at her feet that depicts a scene of what appears to be her resurrection.</p>
        <p>They also found the tomb of a powerful adviser to one of the late dynasties of pharaohs.</p>
        <p>The first discoveries in the ancient cemetery at Bahariya Oasis, 230 miles southwest of Cairo, were announced last summer and hailed as one of the most spectacular archaeological finds in Egypt in several decades. The first four tombs to be explored yielded 105 mummies, many of which were decorated with gilded masks and elaborately painted scenes.</p>
        <p>Dr. Zahi Hawass is director of excavations at the ancient cemetery, estimated to hold several hundred tombs and as many as 10,000 mummies. He has given detailed descriptions and interpretations of the first finds in his new book, ''Valley of the Golden Mummies,'' being published in October by Harry N. Abrams Inc.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hawass, currently a visiting professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, said in a recent interview that the newer findings, made since the book went to press, are possibly more important and fascinating than those first ones.</p>
        <p>''We have found many more styles of tombs, more types of mummies and interesting inscriptions and art dealing with mummification and the blessings of gods,'' Dr. Hawass said. ''This has advanced our knowledge of ancient beliefs in the afterlife.''</p>
        <p>Digging to the west of the tombs explored last year, the archaeologists uncovered burial chambers cut out of the rock and with many different architectural patterns. Tombs of poorer people were simple shafts. The largest tomb, belonging to a rich family, held 42 mummies laid out in several chambers. One of the best preserved of these mummies, a woman wearing a golden mask, especially impressed the excavators. Her hair was colored black and a band of red and yellow flowers rested on her forehead, which was also imprinted with the figure of a cobra, a symbol of the pharaohs. Her chest was covered with cartonnage, a pasteboard made of linen and papyrus that served as mummy cases, which was painted with scenes of the four sons of the god Horus.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hawass described the wooden panel accompanying the mummy of another woman as ''a masterpiece, it is so beautiful.''</p>
        <p>The panel is made of wood and is decorated in the form of a temple facade, perhaps representing a gate to eternity. The woman, in a Roman dress, is depicted in the middle of the gate, Dr. Hawass said, as if she were going to her resurrection. Most of the burials found so far in the cemetery are from the period of Roman rule in Egypt, beginning just before the birth of Christ and lasting several centuries.</p>
        <p>One site at the oasis, though, has been associated with an earlier period, around 500 B. C. in the 26th dynasty of the pharaohs. Explorations by a German scholar in 1900 uncovered the existence of a powerful governor of that dynasty, one Zed-Khonsu-ef-ankh. In chapels attributed to him, Zed-Khonsu is depicted in art as equal in size to the king, suggesting that he was second in power throughout the land.</p>
        <p>In 1947, an Egyptian archaeologist, Ahmed Fakhry, searched the area near Bahariya Oasis for the burial place of this influential governor or vizier. In April, Dr. Hawass completed the search. Entering a remote section of one of the tombs, he saw a large limestone sarcophagus in the small chamber. The sarcophagus was shaped like a human.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Hawass was forced to retreat almost immediately. A thick yellow powder was scattered around the chamber to discourage tomb robbers, and its smell drove him and other excavators away.</p>
        <p>Returning later with masks, the researchers examined the sarcophagus more closely. The image of the goddess Isis was on the right side, and the god Osiris on the left. Hieroglyphic inscriptions extending from the chest to the end of the sarcophagus included the name Zed-Khonsu and his titles as priest of Amon and other gods.</p>
        <p>Getting to the mummy inside the sarcophagus was, the archaelogists said, like opening those nested Russian dolls. When archaeologists removed the heavy limestone lid, they found an inner sarcophagus made of alabaster. And inside it was what had been the wooden coffin and the mummy of the royal vizier, both deteriorated.</p>
        <p>In his book, Dr. Hawass said that Bahariya Oasis apparently enjoyed a period of power and prosperity in the 26th dynasty, especially during the reign of Ahmose II, from 570 to 526 B.C. Zed-Khonsu and his father and brother presumably contributed to and benefited from the improved fortune. Much later, in the Greek and Roman periods, the oasis flourished again primarily from making wine.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rosalie David, an Egyptologist and specialist in mummy studies at Manchester Museum in England, who is not involved in the excavations, praised the discoveries at Bahariya necropolis, saying that it probably holds the greatest concentration of Egyptian mummies ever found.</p>
        <p>In ''Conversations with Mummies,'' a book being published this month by William Morrow, Dr. David, writing with Rick Archbold, said, ''The work of these scientists, combined with the discoveries of the more traditional archaeologists at work in the valley, will open a door into the last great era of ancient Egyptian life, just before Christ displaced Osiris and the rest of the ancient pantheon.''</p>
