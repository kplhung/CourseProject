        <p>Master's Touch  How do you celebrate the ballet master George Balanchine (1904-1983)? If you're the Kennedy Center in Washington, you begin your dance season by convening the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago, the Miami City Ballet, the Pennsylvania Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet, the Suzanne Farrell Ballet Company and members of the Bolshoi Ballet. And, with dancers like Nina Ananiashvili and Sergei Filin of the Bolshoi, and Balanchine alumni like Ms. Farrell and Helgi Tomasson, the artistic director of the San Francisco Ballet, the period from tomorrow through Sept. 24 will be devoted to Balanchine's legacy. Information: (800) 444-1324.</p>
        <p>Culture Bridge  A three-month feast of culture, stretching across two countries and an expanse of sea, begins on Friday in Denmark and Sweden. Consisting of art and design exhibitions, concerts, dance programs and theater performances, Kulturbro 2000, the Culture Bridge, involves more than 700 institutions. All are from greater Copenhagen and the Malmo-Lund area across the Oresund, the strait between Sweden and Zealand, the Danish island. Among the art exhibitions opening on Saturday is ''Gloria Victis! Victors and Vanquished in French Art, 1848-1910,'' which assembles paintings by Courbet, Manet and van Gogh at the Ny Carlsberg Glypotek in Copenhagen through Oct. 15. Kulturbro, which is to be repeated every two years, grew out of the opening on July 1 of a 10-mile bridge and tunnel across the Oresund. Information: 011-45-49-16-07-10.</p>

        <p>Practice Fields  It's back to the great outdoors in the exhibition that opens tomorrow at the Frick Collection. ''A Brush With Nature: The Gere Collection of Landscape Oil Sketches,'' on view through Nov. 12, features nearly 70 pieces by 18th- and 19th-century artists who worked quickly in the open air to hone their skills in capturing the subtle effects of atmosphere and light. Originally shown at the National Gallery in London, these scenic views, gathered by the art historians John and Charlotte Gere, include works by Boldini, Corot and Degas. Information: (212) 288-0700.</p>
        <p>Royal Affair  After a 26-year absence, ''Roberto Devereux'' is coming back to the New York City Opera when the company opens its season at 6:30 tomorrow night at the New York State Theater. Directed by Mark Lamos, this new production of ''Roberto Devereux,'' Donizetti's tale of the doomed love of Queen Elizabeth I and Devereux, the Earl of Essex, stars Lauren Flanigan as the queen; Jane Dutton as her rival, Sara; and Fernando De La Mora in the title role. The opera is one of the season's seven new productions. Information: (212) 870-5570.</p>
