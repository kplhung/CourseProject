        <p>The challenge came after another Giants loss last November, to Washington. Linebacker Jessie Armstead's patience had been tried again, and he finally erupted.

        <p>Armstead knows when he is right. Today, he did not mind congratulating the offense after the Giants' 33-18 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.

        <p>The challenge came after another Giants loss last November, to Washington. Linebacker Jessie Armstead's patience had been tried again, and he finally erupted. Armstead questioned the offense's toughness and said the defense had spent all day on the field trying to carry the team. Armstead's blistering words were quickly seconded by defensive end Michael Strahan, and soon the Giants were embroiled in a family squabble.</p>
        <p>Armstead knows when he is right. Today, he did not mind congratulating the offense after the Giants' 33-18 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. The offense, and not the defense, should be credited, Armstead said, for stopping Philadelphia running back Duce Staley and giving the defense what amounted to an afternoon off.</p>
        <p>''We made a change around here,'' Armstead said. ''People bickered and hollered about me last year. But, hey, people listened, didn't they? Write whatever you want to write. We got the guys rallying to the ball. We got new guys in here. We got an offensive line that protects the quarterback and a quarterback that's making plays. That's all I'm talking about.''</p>
        <p>Because of the offense, and the Redskins' loss today at Detroit, the Giants are 2-0 and alone in first place in the National Football Conference East.</p>
        <p>With the Giants' offense controlling the game in the first half, Staley was almost a footnote. He hardly resembled the back who ran over Dallas for 201 yards last week. Against a defense playing without the injured safety Sam Garnes, Staley finished with 11 yards on 7 carries.</p>
        <p>The Giants' offense exploded against the Eagles' vaunted defense. The offensive line made its mistakes but held Philadelphia's blitzing defense to one sack. Kerry Collins identified the Eagles' pressure and calmly threw for 220 yards, completing 21 of 29 passes with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions.</p>
        <p>Now the offense and the defense are in the midst of a love-in. The Giants have won their first two games for the first time under Coach Jim Fassel and the first time since 1994, and maybe there is something different about this team. Today it handled an Eagles team fresh off a 41-14 smothering at Dallas and forced it to be booed off the field at halftime. Even the usually conservative Fassel admitted the Giants might have opened some eyes around the league today.</p>
        <p>''I think we made a statement because this is a tough place to play,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Last week the Giants unveiled a renewed running game, something they sorely lacked in 1999. But the offense relied almost exclusively on Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne, and Collins was unable to flaunt the passing plays that the new offensive coordinator, Sean Payton, had added to the playbook.</p>
        <p>Part of today's strategy called for quick passes on third down, and Collins was extremely efficient as the offense converted 7 of 14 third downs. The Giants produced 24 first downs, 14 passing.</p>
        <p>The Giants built only a 3-0 first-quarter lead and led by only 6-3 late in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>But then Collins found the rookie Ron Dixon for a 15-yard reception to keep a drive alive on third-and-10. Five plays later, Collins double-pumped and found receiver Amani Toomer alone in the end zone for a 25-yard touchdown. The Giants led, 13-3, with a minute left in the half.</p>
        <p>''I looked at the ball and I was like, 'Oh my God, he's right there,' '' Toomer said.</p>
        <p>The defense produced its fourth three-and-out, and the Giants took over at the Eagles' 42-yard line with 35 seconds left. Two Collins passes produced a first down. Then, from Philadelphia's 31, Barber took a handoff and ran straight to the line, turned 90 degrees to his left and bolted for the sideline. He turned upfield and linebacker Carlos Emmons dived short at the 9-yard line.</p>
        <p>Barber's 31-yard touchdown run capped a 21-second drive as the Giants took a 20-3 lead.</p>
        <p>''Sean's offense is what drives us,'' said Barber, who gained 96 yards on 11 carries. ''Whatever defense you throw at us, he'll know how to solve it.''</p>
        <p>Payton could also be credited for the Giants' dominance in time of possession. They controlled the ball for more than 22 of the 30 minutes of the first half and left cornerback Jason Sehorn joking that the defense struggled to entertain itself on the sideline.</p>
        <p>''That's something we haven't had around here as long as I can remember,'' defensive tackle Keith Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>By halftime, Staley had only 4 yards, and he had been essentially turned into a receiver, making 6 catches for 52 yards in the second half. But the Giants know the Eagles are not a passing team; Donovan McNabb was 19 for 33 passing for 214 yards and was sacked 3 times.</p>
        <p>''That's what gave this team even more fuel,'' Sehorn said. ''We watched this team on film rush for over 300 yards, and that's their strength. Passing is not their strength.''</p>
        <p>The Eagles finished with 56 yards rushing, and the Giants have allowed a combined 99 rushing yards in two games.</p>
        <p>When the Eagles scored a field goal to open the second half and draw within 20-6, Collins again led the offense downfield. Collins and Ike Hilliard combined on a 10-yard shovel pass for a first down. Three plays later, Hilliard sprinted past cornerback Bobby Taylor and safety Damon Moore to catch a 30-yard touchdown pass for a 27-6 lead.</p>
        <p>Collins, who took over as the starting quarterback last season, acknowledged the offense's failures in 1999. He hopes the unit proved something to its teammates on defense.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully they'll see we're an offense that can move the ball and take time off the clock and take the pressure off of them, which I don't think we certainly did last year,'' Collins said. ''If we're playing well, it's going to give everyone confidence.''</p>
        <p>So much had been made of the offense this season that the defense was almost overshadowed. And it did have its shaky moments today. Right after the Giants went ahead by 27-6, McNabb sliced through the middle of the defense for a 15-yard touchdown, spinning past Garnes's replacement, Lyle West. Tackle George Williams blocked the extra point, however.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia scored a fourth-quarter touchdown, but Brad Daluiso added his third and fourth field goals. And for once, the Giants' defense could rest.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people talked about our defense for a funeral,'' Fassel said. ''I wouldn't call the hearse yet.''</p>
