        <p>Last year Major Applewhite was the Big 12 offensive player of the year as the starting quarterback for Texas, which this week is ranked fifth in the Associated Press poll of reporters.

        <p>Highlights and lowlights from the weekend.</p>
        <p>LONE STAR?</p>
        <p>Last year Major Applewhite was the Big 12 offensive player of the year as the starting quarterback for Texas, which this week is ranked fifth in the Associated Press poll of reporters. On Saturday, however, Chris Simms (son of Phil Simms, the former Giants quarterback) started against Louisiana-Lafayette. But Simms's first two possessions ended in a missed field-goal attempt and an interception return for a touchdown that gave the Ragin' Cajuns a 10-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Applewhite took over and led the Longhorns to 31 points before halftime. He showed little sign of off-season knee surgery. He had 315 yards passing and 4 touchdowns in a little more than two quarters.</p>
        <p>Simms finished 7 of 14 for 88 yards in the Longhorns' 52-10 season-opening victory. So is there still a quarterback controversy in Texas?</p>
        <p>''You might as well not ask,'' Coach Mack Brown said. ''I'm not going to say anything about next week.''</p>
        <p>THE HEISMAN HIGHLIGHT REEL  Extended for another week</p>
        <p>Drew Brees was 32 for 46 for 415 yards with 2 touchdowns passing and 2 more rushing as No. 13 Purdue beat Kent State, 45-10.</p>
        <p>Chris Weinke threw for a career-high 443 yards and 2 touchdowns while completing 25 of 38 passes as No. 2 Florida State beat Georgia Tech, 26-21.</p>
        <p>DeShaun Foster picked up 140 yards on 29 attempts and scored 2 fourth-quarter touchdowns so No. 14 U.C.L.A. could get by Fresno State, 24-21.</p>
        <p>Eric Crouch ran for 80 yards, threw for 103 and scored 3 touchdowns, including the 7-yard game-winner in overtime, as No. 1 Nebraska beat No. 21 Notre Dame, 27-24.</p>
        <p>Shelved for lack of action  Quincy Carter was 10 of 24 for 108 yards and 5 interceptions, which led to No. 23 Georgia's 21-10 loss to South Carolina.</p>
        <p>Santana Moss was stripped of the ball on a punt return by Washington linebacker Tyler Krambrink on the Miami 35-yard line. It led to a touchdown. He caught just one pass for 7 yards in the No. 12 Hurricanes' 34-29 loss to the No. 9 Huskies.</p>
        <p>Quarterback problems?  ''We're 2-0, but I am very concerned. We have to get a better performance from our quarterback position to be successful. We have to pick up blitzes. We have to see guys open. We need to get better fast.''</p>
        <p>Coach Bob Toledo of U.C.L.A., after his team outlasted Fresno State, 24-21, despite poor performances from Ryan McCann and Scott McEwan. They face No. 3 Michigan this week.</p>
        <p>Opponent problems?  ''They were yelping a bit in the tunnel. They found out who the real dogs were.''</p>
        <p>Washington tight end Jerramy Stevens, referring to Miami players who mocked Husky fans on Saturday.</p>
