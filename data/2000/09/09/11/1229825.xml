        <p>It was the First Family versus the Soprano family at the annual Emmy presentation tonight. And the First Family -- or NBC's ''West Wing'' -- almost bludgeoned HBO's ''Sopranos.''</p>
        <p>''The West Wing'' won five Emmys during the evening, including best drama series. ''The Sopranos,'' which competed directly with the NBC show in several categories, won  only once all night.</p>
        <p>James Gandolfini, who plays Tony Soprano, was the lone exception to the ''West Wing'' steamroller. He won the best actor award, defeating Martin Sheen (''West Wing''), Jerry Orbach (''Law and Order''), Dennis Franz (''N.Y.P.D. Blue'') and Sam Waterston (''Law and Order'').</p>
        <p>But two of Mr. Gandolfini's co-stars on ''The Sopranos,'' Edie Falco, who won last year, and Lorraine Bracco, were unexpectedly passed over by the Emmy voters in favor of Sela Ward. Ms. Ward won for her role as Lily Manning, a divorced woman seeking to rebuild her life, in the ABC drama ''Once and Again.''</p>
        <p>The overwhelming loss of ''The Sopranos'' to ''The West Wing'' and other shows seemed partly because of the obvious affection that Emmy voters had for NBC's White House drama. But perhaps another reason was that voters were expressing resentment toward HBO for a show that pushed the envelope of violence and language and has become a favorite among critics, who have often cited ''The Sopranos'' positively in noting the paucity of first-rate drama on network television.</p>
        <p>What stamped last night's awards show, though, was not only the triumph of ''The West Wing,'' but the fact that voters seemed to brush aside veteran comedy shows like ''Friends'' and ''Ally McBeal'' in favor of newer comedies like ''Will and Grace'' and ''Malcolm in the Middle.''</p>
        <p>Emmy voters have traditionally given awards to older shows, but the prizes this year seemed, in some cases, to be an exception. The winner of the best comedy series was NBC's ''Will and Grace,'' about two gay men and their female neighbors. The show beat CBS's ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' NBC's ''Frasier'' and ''Friends,'' and HBO's ''Sex and the City.''</p>
        <p>Megan Mullally of ''Will and Grace'' was named best supporting actress in a comedy series. The other nominees were Jennifer Aniston (''Friends''), Kim Cattrell (''Sex and the City''), Lisa Kudrow (''Friends'') and Doris Roberts (''Everybody Loves Raymond'').</p>
        <p>And Sean Hayes, who plays a flamboyantly gay character on ''Will and Grace,'' won the award as best supporting actor in a comedy series. The other nominees were Peter Boyle and Brad Garrett of ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' Peter MacNicol of ''Ally McBeal'' and David Hyde Pierce of ''Frasier.''</p>
        <p>Todd Holland was named best director of a comedy series for Fox's ''Malcolm in the Middle,'' about a dysfunctional family. The show also won a writing award for Linwood Boomer.</p>
        <p>One exception to the trend toward rewarding the new was Michael J. Fox, who won as lead actor in the ABC comedy ''Spin City,'' which has been on since 1997. Mr. Fox, who was given a standing ovation, left the show earlier in the year because he is battling Parkinson's disease.</p>
        <p>''It's been a great ride,'' Mr. Fox told the audience. ''Stay tuned.'' He had previously won three Emmys in a row, from 1986 to 1988, for his starring role in ''Family Ties.''</p>
        <p>Another exception was Patricia Heaton, who won as best comedy actress for CBS's ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' which also came on the air in 1997.</p>
        <p>Among the multiple winners at last night's ceremony, which was broadcast on ABC, was ''Oprah Winfrey Presents: 'Tuesdays With Morrie.' '' It won an award for best television movie for ABC, best actor in a mini-series or movie for Jack Lemmon, and best supporting actor for Hank Azaria.</p>
        <p>The question of whether the groundbreaking and acclaimed ''Sopranos'' would defeat ''The West Wing,'' the Aaron Sorkin-John Wells hit, recurred throughout the evening.  ''The West Wing'' began picking up awards early for its actors and creators.</p>
        <p>Allison Janney, who plays C. J. Cregg, the White House press secretary, won the supporting actress award. Then Richard Schiff, who plays Toby Ziegler, a White House aide, was named best supporting actor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sorkin and Rick Cleveland won a writing Emmy for one of the episodes, and Thomas Schlamme was given the award for his directing of the show. Mr. Schlamme said that the show had special meaning for him because his parents had fled Nazi Germany.</p>
        <p>''To work on a show that represents so much work and optimism makes me extraordinarily proud,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sorkin said later of the show's Emmy success: ''Hopefully, it will bring people to the show.''</p>
        <p>He added that he was quite certain now that he had keep his parking space at Warner Brothers -- which produces the show -- for at least another year.</p>
        <p>During the awards show, broadcast from the Shrine Auditorium on the University of Southern California campus, a majority of the actors wore yellow ribbons in support of striking members of the Screen Actors Guild in their prolonged fight with advertising agencies.</p>
        <p>In other awards, Halle Berry won for her portrayal of the singer Dorothy Dandridge in HBO's ''Introducing Dorothy Dandridge.''</p>
        <p>Vanessa Redgrave won for her role as supporting actress in the HBO film ''If These Walls Could Talk 2.'' HBO's ''The Corner'' won an Emmy for best mini-series, and David Simon and David Mills, two journalists turned screenwriters, won a writing Emmy for it. Charles S. Dutton, the actor, also won an Emmy for directing ''The Corner.''</p>
        <p>Eddie Izzard was given two Emmys for his variety show, HBO's ''Dress to Kill,'' one for writing and one for individual performance.</p>
        <p>The Emmy Awards, which were presided over this year by Garry Shandling, have been a troubled show. Last year the show scored its lowest ratings since 1990, and some television critics and viewers complained that the awards were out of touch with what audiences sought and favored.</p>
        <p>Last year, for example, ''The Sopranos,'' which was in its first year, was unexpectedly passed over as best drama in favor of ''The Practice,'' David E. Kelley's show about a Boston law firm, the second time that series had won. (Mr. Kelley is a favorite of Emmy voters.)</p>
        <p>As a result of criticisms, the Academy sought to alter its procedures this year.</p>
        <p>The Emmy system is unlike those of the Academy Awards or the Grammys, in which members select the winners en masse. The 9,500 members of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences select nominees. But the winners, in recent years, had been chosen by poorly attended panels of volunteers ranging from 7 to 70 people who watched tapes of the nominated shows at a Beverly Hills hotel for a long weekend and then voted. The volunteers were often retired or had plenty of time on their hands.</p>
        <p>This year, the academy altered the voting process to increase the number of people voting and to prevent the same actors and writer-producers from walking off with Emmys year after year. The major change was that volunteers would get copies of tapes of nominated shows to watch at home and then vote by mail.</p>
        <p>''This was a really big step in bringing more credibility to the voting process,'' Garth Ancier, the president of NBC Entertainment, told The Hollywood Reporter. ''There have been certain winners in recent years where we've all just scratched our heads.''</p>
