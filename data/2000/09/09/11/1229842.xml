        <p>The highlight of the Rangers' second day of training camp in Burlington, Vt., was two heavyweight bouts featuring Dale Purinton and Sandy McCarthy.</p>
        <p>Purinton, a rugged defenseman who is trying to fight his way onto the Rangers' roster, decided to see how he measured up against McCarthy, the first true heavyweight enforcer the Rangers have had in some time.</p>
        <p>The 23-year-old Purinton, who weighs about 220 pounds, goaded the 28-year-old McCarthy, who at 215 pounds has dropped 20 pounds from his playing weight of last season, into a fight during an intrasquad game yesterday morning.</p>
        <p>McCarthy, known as one of the best fighters in the National Hockey League, challenged Purinton to a rematch the next time the two were on the ice. Purinton accepted and held his own in a battle so fierce that Rangers President Glen Sather, Coach Ron Low and the assistant coach Ted Green could be heard screaming to break up the fight as it went on.</p>
        <p>McCarthy emerged with some scratches near his right eye. Purinton walked away with a cut in the corner of his right eye -- and a measure of respect from McCarthy, who made it a point to shake Purinton's hand after the intrasquad game.</p>
