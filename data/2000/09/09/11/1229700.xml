        <p>IN MANDARIN Chinese, the term for table tennis translates to ''national ball,'' and the last Olympic tournament in Atlanta did indeed bear a strong resemblance to a domestic competition as the Chinese swept all four events: men's singles and doubles, and women's singles and doubles.

        <p>IN MANDARIN Chinese, the term for table tennis translates to ''national ball,'' and the last Olympic tournament in Atlanta did indeed bear a strong resemblance to a domestic competition as the Chinese swept all four events: men's singles and doubles, and women's singles and doubles. More domination is hardly out of the question in Sydney.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- The gap between elite table tennis and Ping-Pong, the basement variety of the game that the majority of us have sampled at some stage, is as wide as the gap between a game of crazy eights and world-class bridge.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- Same as in the basement. Matches are three-of-five-game affairs and games are won by the first player to reach 21. If a game is tied at 20, a player must win by 2 points.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- Two adversaries in the world championships once required more than an hour to finish a single point. But table tennis is usually a more expeditious affair with its spinning, elusive serves and aggressive topspin forehand drives. The objective is to keep an opponent off balance by disguising shot direction and producing rhythm shifts, sharp angles and drop shots.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- China's Liu Guoliang won the men's singles and doubles at the 1996 Games, and at age 24, remains at the peak of his powers. But the last year has been one of controversy and frustration. Shortly after winning the men's world singles title last year, he tested positive for the banned substance epitosterone. A legal and medical marathon ensued, and Liu was finally cleared by the International Table Tennis Federation in April. By then, he had already lost to the 1992 Olympic champion Jan-Ove Waldner and his Swedish compatriot Jorgen Persson as the Chinese were upset by the Swedes in the world team championships. The women's singles favorites are China's Wang Nan and her doubles partner, Li Ju.</p>
