        <p>Since it opened in February, the Harlem U.S.A. retail and entertainment complex on 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard has provided jobs for hundreds of local residents and has drawn crowds to national chain stores like Modell's Sporting Goods, Old Navy and HMV Record Stores.</p>
        <p>But what Harlem U.S.A. does not yet have are independent stores with minority owners. This has been a sore point with some people in the neighborhood -- among them, the city councilman who represents Harlem, Bill Perkins.</p>

        <p>Since it opened in February, the Harlem U.S.A. retail and entertainment complex on 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard has provided jobs for hundreds of local residents and has drawn crowds to national chain stores like Modell's Sporting Goods, Old Navy and HMV Record Stores.</p>
        <p>But what Harlem U.S.A. does not yet have are independent stores with minority owners. This has been a sore point with some people in the neighborhood -- among them, the city councilman who represents Harlem, Bill Perkins.</p>
        <p>Efforts are under way, however, to bring several black-owned businesses to the shopping complex, including Harlem's first large bookstore, said Drew Greenwald, the president of Grid Properties, the private company that developed the $66 million Harlem U.S.A. with the Harlem Commonwealth Council, a local nonprofit organization. Mr. Greenwald said he is negotiating leases with several retailers that want to expand into Harlem. They include Blackberry, a small chain of home-furnishings boutiques; Moshood, which operates a popular clothing store in Fort Greene, Brooklyn; and the bookstore, which is called Hue-Man Experience in Harlem. These stores would occupy a total of 8,500 square feet of adjoining space on the second floor, Mr. Greenwald said.</p>
        <p>In June, Clara Villarosa, the founder of Hue-Man Experience, a bookstore in Denver that focuses on black and multicultural themes, received a $475,000 loan from the New York Empowerment Zone to help her get the new bookstore going. Ms. Villarosa sold the Denver store and now lives in Harlem.</p>
        <p>The empowerment zone, a seven-member board that administers a huge government program to stimulate economic development in Upper Manhattan and the South Bronx, is expected to vote soon on loans of $325,000 and $300,000, respectively, to Blackberry and Moshood. The loans have been approved by the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, which manages the program for Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood. The vote was supposed to take place Friday, but the board meeting was postponed after some members complained that the financial information they were given was incomplete. No new meeting date was set.</p>
        <p>Jim Capel, the chief of staff for United States Representative Charles B. Rangel, a member of the empowerment zone board, said that he expected the pending loans to be approved. ''Oftentimes, emerging businesses have difficulty getting into these buildings because they can't afford the rent,'' he said. ''The empowerment zone is doing everything it can to help them.''</p>
        <p>Blackberry, based in Arlington, Va., sells African art and candelabras, table runners and other items inspired by African themes, said Barry Blackman, who founded the store 10 years ago with Dorothy White and her daughter, Diane White. The store has boutiques at Macy's in Manhattan and Brooklyn and at Stern's in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blackman said that having a free-standing store at Harlem U.S.A., instead of being limited to a boutique inside a department store, would allow Blackberry to sell furniture along with the smaller items. ''To be included in this type of mixture is really very interesting to us,'' he said, referring to the shopping complex. ''The demographics are really great.''</p>
        <p>Moshood, named for its Nigerian proprietor, carries contemporary clothing made from traditional African prints. The six-year-old store attracts passers-by by featuring live mannequins in its windows and has helped to revitalize the Fulton Street shopping strip in Fort Greene. Moshood also has a store in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenwald said that he has always intended to mix in tenants like these with the national retailers. ''We've been trying from Day 1 to identify minority-owned businesses that would fit in with the project,'' Mr. Greenwald said.</p>
        <p>Councilman Perkins said many Harlem residents have mixed feelings about Harlem U.S.A. ''Obviously, folks appreciate the convenience of being able to shop in their neighborhood, as opposed to having to travel downtown,'' Mr. Perkins said. But he said that many entrepreneurs who had stuck it out in Harlem when times were hard now felt they were being left out. ''They feel that now that resources are available,'' he said, ''they're not experiencing the good times.''</p>
        <p>He said the proposed stores, which would be newcomers to the neighborhood, were a ''step in the right direction.''</p>
        <p>Outside the Modell's store at Harlem U.S.A., Ella Brown, an insurance company representative in her 40's who lives in Harlem, said she had nothing against national chains, ''just as long as they give to the community, such as jobs.''</p>
        <p>She said she had only one priority when she went out to shop: ''Getting what I want at a reasonable price.''</p>
