        <p>In a country where swimming is the most popular Olympic sport, where important meets draw prime-time television exposure and exorbitant ratings, it is a 17-year-old named Ian Thorpe who has Australia entranced.</p>
        <p>His trips to the movies and club-hopping nights on the town make the gossip pages. Every woman he is photographed with draws the kind of urgent conjecture that once attended May Day photographs of the Kremlin hierarchy. When he travels, the hotel rooms on either side of him are taken by security guards, lest overzealous fans induce a hard day's night.</p>
        <p>The first evening of the Sydney Olympics, all of Australia will be captivated by this 6-foot-5-inch, 210-pound teenager with size 17 feet, who will swim the 400-meter freestyle to win a gold medal, and perhaps to lower his own world record of 3 minutes 41.33 seconds. The Thorpedo, as he is known, is also favored in the 200 freestyle -- his world record is 1:45.41 -- and he will swim for a third gold medal in the 800-meter freestyle relay.</p>

        <p>In a country where swimming is the most popular Olympic sport, where important meets draw prime-time television exposure and exorbitant ratings, it is a 17-year-old named Ian Thorpe who has Australia entranced.</p>
        <p>His trips to the movies and club-hopping nights on the town make the gossip pages. Every woman he is photographed with draws the kind of urgent conjecture that once attended May Day photographs of the Kremlin hierarchy. When he travels, the hotel rooms on either side of him are taken by security guards, lest overzealous fans induce a hard day's night.</p>
        <p>The first evening of the Sydney Olympics, all of Australia will be captivated by this 6-foot-5-inch, 210-pound teenager with size 17 feet, who will swim the 400-meter freestyle to win a gold medal, and perhaps to lower his own world record of 3 minutes 41.33 seconds. The Thorpedo, as he is known, is also favored in the 200 freestyle -- his world record is 1:45.41 -- and he will swim for a third gold medal in the 800-meter freestyle relay.</p>
        <p>So dominant is Thorpe that his teammate, Michael Klim, the 1998 world champion in the 200-meter freestyle, will skip the event in Sydney. Thorpe is modest, mature beyond his years and quietly confident. He is also a millionaire who enjoys dabbling in day trading of stocks. Don Talbot, the 67-year-old Australian Olympic coach, said he has never seen a more capable swimmer in five decades of international experience.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen a better swimmer than him,'' Talbot said at the United States Olympic swimming trials. ''He's got a great feel for the water. He makes it look easy. His maturity, that's what you notice. He's 17, but he seems like he's someone in his 30's or 40's. It's almost spooky.''</p>
        <p>But with expectation comes enormous pressure. If his reputation is to remain buoyant, Thorpe must win a gold medal, maybe even more than one, Talbot said.</p>
        <p>''I think he's coping, handling it well, but he's got to feel pressure,'' Talbot said. ''Nineteen million people want him to win. He's a young boy with an octogenarian's head. It's amazing. But he's got to feel the pressure. In Australia, it's always been that way. You're nothing until you win a gold medal. If you don't win gold at the Olympics, you're not one of the greats.''</p>
        <p>Having a country's hopes resting on your shoulders, especially with the Olympics in your hometown, can be a weighty burden. Thorpe trained in the United States for part of this summer, seeking the benefits of altitude and anonymity at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs.</p>
        <p>''In Australia, swimmers are treated like rock stars,'' he said in a recent telephone interview. ''That's difficult to deal with at times. It takes away my privacy. I don't have the ability to walk down the street. I don't have the ability to get away from myself. That's the hardest thing, dealing with being me. I can't get a holiday from what I do. But I always look at the support as being positive. I see it more as opportunity than pressure, as something that pushes me as opposed to wearing me down.''</p>
        <p>He has told friends that he wants to retreat from the public after the Olympics but so far has refused to live the life of a reclusive star. After all, he is only 17, and it is every teenager's inalienable right not to be bound by the walls of home. Getting out is as indispensable as oxygen.</p>
        <p>''If I wanted to, I could stop swimming and stop being a public figure,'' Thorpe said. ''I don't want to do that. I'm not willing to give up what I have.''</p>
        <p>Like millions of other Australians, Thorpe learned to swim by age 6 or 7. As Talbot explained it, 95 percent of the population on the island continent lives within 10 miles of the coastline. ''We better learn to swim,'' the coach said.</p>
        <p>Thorpe's older sister, Christina, was an elite distance swimmer, and as Ian followed her to swim meets, he decided to take up the sport himself. There was one slight problem. He was allergic to chlorine and swam with his head out of the water. But, having suffered bronchial pneumonia as a child, he found breathing easier in the warm humid air of swimming pools, even if he had to battle through sinus congestion and headaches.</p>
        <p>''When I was younger, I had all the tests done, and the doctor said to my mom, 'If he's going to be a champion, he might as well have his adenoids removed,' '' Thorpe said. ''She said, 'No, he's got the genes to play soccer and cricket.' ''</p>
        <p>Thorpe's father and grandfather had excelled at cricket, but he stayed in the pool. His sister qualified for the Atlanta Olympics but did not meet the time standard to compete in the 400-meter freestyle. Ian, meanwhile, set 13 state records in 13 short-course meets as a 12-year-old. By age 14, he turned professional, encouraged by his mother, Margaret, a teacher, and by his personal coach, Doug Frost. With a year of high school remaining, he took a sabbatical the past year to prepare for the Olympics. Eventually, he plans to study medicine.</p>
        <p>''It was becoming too much, the public and professional side, and trying to study,'' said Thorpe, who ranked near the top of his class. ''Education is so important, I didn't want to jeopardize it, so I decided to defer my studies.''</p>
        <p>At the 1998 world championships, held in Perth, Australia, Thorpe won the 400-meter freestyle at age 15, becoming the youngest world champion ever. Earlier this year, he broke three world records at the Australian Olympic trials. But the use of performance-enhancing drugs is believed to be so pervasive in Olympic sports that any remarkable performance in events such as swimming and track and field brings immediate suspicion.</p>
        <p>Manfred Theismann, a German swim coach, said in February that some people believed Thorpe was using banned substances. Chris-Carol Bremer, captain of the German swim team, told a German newspaper that he believed the size of Thorpe's feet could have been produced by a drug such as human growth hormone. Both later apologized.</p>
        <p>Thorpe, who has been outspoken against the use of drugs, said the despairing thing was that the current urine-based testing procedures were so deficient that innocent athletes can no longer prove their innocence. He said he would be willing to undergo blood testing and have the samples stored until tests for human growth hormone and other banned substances were approved.</p>
        <p>''It's a really sad thing that happens in sport, athletes being accused of something they don't do,'' Thorpe said. ''In a way, they're complimenting me by saying I'm doing something at such a level they don't believe I can get to without drugs. But it's disappointing because a lot of children look up to me, and when they see the media talk up the accusations, it puts negative thoughts in children's minds.''</p>
        <p>Thorpe's large feet do help him swim faster, but it has nothing to do with drugs, according to Australian sports authorities. His feet are so flexible that he can touch his shin with his toes, Talbot said. The surface area and flexibility of Thorpe's feet help generate a great force to propel him through the water, high on the surface, thus reducing drag, said Bruce Mason, a biomechanics expert at the Australian Institute of Sport. He is also aided by the bodysuits approved this year.</p>
        <p>Thorpe uses a six-beat kicking cycle, generally used by sprinters at shorter distances; the turbulence created in the water ''is like being in a washing machine,'' according to the South African swimmer Ryk Neethling. Daniel Kowalski, who won three freestyle medals for Australia in Atlanta, said the agitation of Thorpe's wash is such that he tries to avoid finishing second and third in any prelims so that he will not be given a lane next to Thorpe in the finals..</p>
        <p>''He gets up on the plane the way a speedboat does,'' said Frost, Thorpe's personal coach.</p>
        <p>His stroke is nearly 9 feet long, so attenuated that Thorpe needs only 16 strokes per 50-meter lap, compared with 20 that his fellow Australian Kieren Perkins used to win the 1,500-meter swim in Atlanta. Thorpe also watches videotapes of his performances and boxes for cross-training. But his greatest assets are his maturity and emotional stability, said Clark Perry, the Australian team's sports psychologist.</p>
        <p>''At this age they tend to go up and down a bit, but Ian is very level,'' Perry said. ''When he is swimming, he is not racing others, he is racing Ian Thorpe.''</p>
        <p>His face is ubiquitous in Australia, endorsing a phone company, an airline, a bank, a cereal and an automobile. But Thorpe has also been acclaimed for his generosity with children's charities and for his visits to children's hospitals. One of his closest friends is 15-year-old Michael Williams, the brother of his sister's husband, who received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkins lymphoma in 1997. Williams has accompanied Thorpe to several recent meets and will be on hand for the Olympics. His friend's struggle changed his own life, Thorpe said.</p>
        <p>''He was diagnosed at a time when I wasn't training as fast as I had in the past and I was questioning why I was swimming,'' Thorpe said. ''Here was Michael, with a thousand tubes in him, having a potentially fatal disease. The last thing he could do was get into a pool. I was feeling sorry for myself. It made me realize that life is so precious and you have to make the most of it.''</p>
        <p>A recent commercial featuring Thorpe showed him swimming with seals in the same sleek, effortless manner. But if Thorpe has one frailty as an athlete, Talbot said, it is his gawkiness out of the water. Last fall, Thorpe fractured a bone in his foot while jogging and had to swim for a while in a Fiberglas cast.</p>
        <p>''He can't run,'' Talbot said. ''Swimmers can't run. They should never run.''</p>
