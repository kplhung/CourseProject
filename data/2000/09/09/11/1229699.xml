        <p>THERE IS a different look to these Olympics. The compulsories have been eliminated, and the so-called 6-5-4 rule (six gymnasts are on a team, five compete on each apparatus and the four highest scores count) means event specialists are much more important.</p>
        <p>Although the Romanian women and the Chinese men enter as the favorites for the gold medals, the new scoring method makes determining the winners difficult. Now, strategy is more important, and a poor routine is more costly.</p>
        <p>In 1996, the Magnificent Seven surprised the world and won the first team gold for the United States. But with weaknesses on the vault and on the balance beam, Bela Karolyi's troops could have difficulty trying to defend their title.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- The women compete on four apparatus: vault, uneven bars, floor exercise and balance beam. If there are two apparatus that send shivers down the spine of gymnasts, they are the balance beam and the uneven bars. For 70 to 90 seconds on a 4-inch-wide beam, using forward and backward tumbling passes, a gymnast has to have equal levels of courage and concentration. The uneven bars are made more difficult because of the precision it takes to execute transitions from bar to bar and to execute release moves.</p>
        <p>The men perform on six apparatus: floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings, vault, high bar and parallel bars. The one event that does not allow for a pause or a hiccup in the routine is the pommel horse, which is considered the most difficult. To most, the pommel horse requires twice as long to master. The brute strength of the men will also be judged on the still rings. No matter how talented a gymnast is, if he does not have the physical might to perform in this event, his chance for placing in the all-around competition is remote.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- During team competition preliminaries, gymnasts perform an optional exercise -- compulsories were eliminated after 1996 -- on each apparatus. The scores are used to advance individuals to the all-around finals and the apparatus finals, and to place entire teams in the team final competition. This puts on the pressure from Day 1.</p>
        <p>Six gymnasts from each of the 12 top nations at the world championships are entitled to participate in the team finals for the men's and women's titles. But this year, no more than five gymnasts (which are selected by the national coaches) may compete on a single apparatus, and the four highest scores count toward the 6-5-4 team total. The working order of the team is decided by each country. Once qualifying ends, the team competition begins with the previous scores discarded.</p>
        <p>The top 36 gymnasts from the team competition, with a maximum of three per nation, qualify to compete in the all-around finals. With numbers restrictions, this allows isolated gymnasts from nations that have underdeveloped programs to show their talents. During the men's and women's all-around finals, each gymnast performs an optional routine on each apparatus. The male and female gymnasts with the highest cumulative score win the gold medal and will hold the sport's most prestigious title as the all-around champion.</p>
        <p>On the last day of competition, the apparatus finals takes place. The top eight gymnasts on each apparatus from the team competition, with a maximum of two per country, qualify. A gymnast who competes in only one apparatus in team competition is still eligible to participate in the finals. As in the all-around and the team finals, the scoring begins anew. Gold medals are awarded for each apparatus.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- There was a lot of hand-wringing over the subjective selection process for the American women's team. The reason for the procedure came down to strategy. Until recently, every athlete that made the team competed on every apparatus, and the lowest score was dropped. But in 1997, the 6-5-4 format was adopted for men's and women's international competition. Teams are allowed to use all six team members in any lineup for the most advantageous team position. A gymnast does not have to compete on every apparatus to contribute. For example, a gymnast may be weak on one event but be a specialist on another.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, coaches will play a shell game with their lineups from apparatus to apparatus in order to maximizing their gymnasts' strengths.</p>
        <p>A perfect score in gymnastics is still 10.0, but there are start values for each routine. A difficult routine is worth 10.0, but a less complex one might be worth only 9.75. However, numbers do not always add up in judging. In the past, judges tended to score gymnasts who competed early in the lineup much harder, leaving themselves room to give higher scores to later competitors. A typical coaching strategy is to start each apparatus with a gymnast who is likely to complete a routine flawlessly. As a result, the gymnasts can set the table for less-talented teammates.</p>
        <p>But there is a flip side to this, too; often the leadoff performer cannot gain the top marks and ends up as the sacrificial lamb for the team.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- If the two remaining members of the Magnificent Seven -- Amy Chow and Dominique Dawes -- are going to recapture the glory from 1996, they will have to lead the American team past the strong Romanians, Russians and Chinese. Romania is the reigning world champion and is led by the disciplined and spectacular Simona Amanar, Maria Olaru and Andreea Raducan. The Russians feature the vault champion Yelena Zamolodchikova, while the Chinese are anchored by Jie Ling on the balance beam.</p>
        <p>To help boost an American team that bottomed out with a poor showing at the 1999 world championships, Bela Karolyi returned as national coordinator and began camps to rebuild the team's confidence and improve the difficulty levels on the gymnasts' routines. Chow and Dawes, along with the budding Elise Ray and Kristen Maloney, hope to make Karolyi's return a success by putting the United States in medal contention.</p>
        <p>The men's team from China has been in the position as favorite before at the Olympics. Four years ago, the Chinese arrived as world champions but faltered in Atlanta and finished with a silver behind Russia. China is led by Zhen Dong on the still rings and Wei Yang on the horizontal bar, while Russia will return with Nikolai Kryukov and Aleksei Nemov from the country's 1996 gold medal team. Belarus could also be a threat if Ivan Ivankov (Achilles' tendon injury) is fit to perform. The Americans have a long way to go before finding themselves among the elite.</p>
        <p>RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS -- Judging in this female-only event often seems to be based more on how eye-pleasing each competitor is rather than on how well she executes sometimes suggestive routines with five apparatus: rope, hoop, ball, ribbon and clubs. In the individual competition, gymnasts perform with four of the five apparatus. In the team competition, five gymnasts work together as one unit. The favorites for the all-around title in this sport are from Ukraine: the 1997 world champion, Yelena Vitrichenko, and the 1996 gold medal winner in Atlanta, Ekaterina Serebrianskaya. Also pushing Ukraine will be Russia, Bulgaria, Spain and Belarus.</p>
        <p>TRAMPOLINE -- In the sport's Olympic debut, the men's and women's trampoline competitions will be judged based on two routines: compulsory and voluntary. Jennifer Parilla is the only American to qualify for the Olympics. Russia, France and Belarus all have strong teams in men's and women's trampoline.</p>
