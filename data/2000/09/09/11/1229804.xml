        <p>THESE things are never easy, the passing of a torch from aging champion to rising star. And make no mistake, that's exactly what this was, the ceremonial anointing of a 20-year-old Russian named Marat Safin, following the kind of hard-court pounding Pete Sampras hasn't taken even in his most fitful night of sleep.</p>
        <p>Naturally, Sampras handled the potentially awkward moment like the gentleman he has always been on all the world's tennis courts. He stepped back graciously with his plate of silver, his second-place token, with an unforced smile, with no excuses offered, with the highest form of flattery he could possibly give.</p>

        <p>THESE things are never easy, the passing of a torch from aging champion to rising star. And make no mistake, that's exactly what this was, the ceremonial anointing of a 20-year-old Russian named Marat Safin, following the kind of hard-court pounding Pete Sampras hasn't taken even in his most fitful night of sleep.</p>
        <p>Naturally, Sampras handled the potentially awkward moment like the gentleman he has always been on all the world's tennis courts. He stepped back graciously with his plate of silver, his second-place token, with an unforced smile, with no excuses offered, with the highest form of flattery he could possibly give.</p>
        <p>''He reminded me of me when I was 19 and came here and won the first time,'' Sampras had said when asked to explain Safin's 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 victory yesterday in the United States Open final, when Sampras was suddenly playing in the shadow that typically enshrouds his shave-starved face.</p>
        <p>Safin turned 20 last January, which was about the time he was tanking a match at the Australian Open and accumulating enough first-round losses to consider a hasty exit from the sport. He kept changing coaches and even yesterday, after Safin climbed into the stands to give him an appreciative hug, Aleksandr Volkov was calling himself ''more friend than coach.''</p>
        <p>Volkov, a Sampras victim himself here in the semifinals seven years ago, couldn't really explain Safin's about-face in the spring any more than he could fathom Safin's dominance of Sampras, or a run through the draw that was every bit as stunning as Sampras's 10 years ago. ''You think I know?'' Safin said when Tony Trabert asked him how he had treated the famed Sampras serve as if it were a Sunday morning hacker's.</p>
        <p>Nobody knows when a great player will emerge, not even those who know him best. The friends in the box with Volkov smiled down at Safin as he posed and postured with the trophy for an army of photographers, and it was as if they were all back home in Russia, watching some fantasy on Hollywood film.</p>
        <p>''Ten years ago Marat came to the U.S. for the first time,'' said his friend, Anna Grendal, tears in her blue eyes. ''Who would've thought that 10 years later, he would beat Pete Sampras in the finals of the U.S. Open?''</p>
        <p>They were a select group of Russian kids, she said, allowed out of a country percolating with political unrest, sent to Indianapolis for two months of training, with time off for introduction to America's commercial wares.</p>
        <p>''None of us had ever seen any of the things here, the restaurants, the grocery stores,'' Grendal said. ''The whole thing was unbelievable to us, even more unbelievable than this.''</p>
        <p>Anna Kournikova was part of the group from the Spartack Club in Moscow, as was Elena Dementieva, and it was during the summer Sampras would announce himself in Flushing Meadows that Marat Safin went to Disney World, where he ate every snack and rode every ride.</p>
        <p>His mother had been his coach, but if any kid could pick up and leave home without his parents, live in a far different culture and learn a new language, it was Safin, Grendal said. He always had an aura, an adventurous streak and the gift of gab.</p>
        <p>So the parents were at Safin's place yesterday in Valencia, Spain, Volkov said, watching on television, instead of in the box, with the sort-of coach and the other pals. ''It was always better for Marat that he was independent, on his own,'' said Grendal, a University of Moscow journalism student. ''He didn't need his dad or mom to tell him what to do. Since he's been young, he's been that way.''</p>
        <p>That, too, has always been part of Sampras's charm, and strength. In 1990, there was the revelation that back home in Palos Verdes, Calif., Sam and Georgia Sampras were too nervous to watch their son play Andre Agassi in the final. They went out to a movie or the mall.</p>
        <p>''I tortured them enough in the final in Wimbledon,'' Sampras had said, when asked if his parents would be attending yesterday. ''They'll be going for their walk, I'm sure, come 4 o'clock.''</p>
        <p>The parents went to Wimbledon last July to watch their son win his record 13th Grand Slam. Father and son hugged afterward, right there in the stands of the famous Center Court. The expression on Sam Sampras's face said it all, so he didn't make himself available for reporters later.</p>
        <p>It was back to business as usual, as always, with Pete Sampras standing up and speaking for himself, be it as the precocious teenager winning his first U.S. Open, or as an aging superstar who was denied his fifth.</p>
        <p>''Whatever I tried, he just had the answers,'' Sampras said.</p>
        <p>His hair is thinning now. He looked tired yesterday, pushing his approach shots and lunging at the low returns that ultimately set up Safin's devastating passes. Put these two on grass tomorrow, on fresher legs, and maybe Sampras is still the favorite. Yet hardcourt is the neutral surface, a true competitive measure. Marat Safin is no Goran Ivanisevic. A few more performances like this one, and the whole world will be Disney.</p>
