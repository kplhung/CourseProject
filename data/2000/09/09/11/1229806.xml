        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>After I had left Starbucks on 110th Street and Broadway the other morning, a man came up to me.</p>
        <p>''You're still as tall as ever,'' he said. ''It's Mike, Mrs. Johnson's son -- Delores Johnson.''</p>
        <p>I'm often at a loss recognizing characters from my past, but I thought that exactly who Mike was would surely come to me. In the meantime, I said, ''Oh yes, hello.''</p>
        <p>''She passed away last night,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Oh, I'm so sorry,'' I replied.</p>
        <p>At this point, he asked if I would like to go to the wake. I said that unfortunately I was on my way to work and had other plans later.</p>
        <p>''Would you like to contribute for the flowers?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>I then caught the odor of alcohol and, looking directly at him, realized I had never met Mike or the apparently deceased Mrs. Johnson. But the $2 change from Starbucks was easily accessible in my pocket.</p>
        <p>''Of course,'' I said, and handed him the money.</p>
        <p>''Thanks,'' he murmured, and then sped off.</p>
        <p>The price was reasonable for such an exhilarating piece of theater.</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>The only thing that prevents me from completely enjoying concerts and theater in New York is waiting in line in the ladies' room. Recently, at Alice Tully Hall, I thought I'd outsmarted everyone and raced in as soon as the doors opened to use the facilities before the concert started. To my dismay, there were already 15 women in line. Why do they waste all that valuable space with sit-down vanity tables, when all we really want is a few extra stalls?</p>
        <p>''It's the architects,'' I fumed in frustration. ''Until there are more women architects, these bathrooms will never be designed correctly. In my next life, I'm coming back as an architect.''</p>
        <p>The woman behind me, obviously more resigned to the situation than I, didn't miss a beat. ''Save yourself the trouble,'' she said. ''Come back as a man.''</p>
        <p>SUSAN HARRINGTON</p>
        <p>One of the markets in Fort Lee, N.J., apparently has a problem with customers looking over the fresh corn and digging out a kernel or two to taste. Mary Leigh Lipman noticed a recent sign over the corn: ''This store is not rated 'X.' Please do not strip our corn.''</p>
        <p>Joseph Justman walked to a bus stop on Eighth Avenue in Chelsea and joined a number of people waiting there. When an almost empty bus came along and they got on, it ended up jammed. The first person who got on at the next stop was a man whom Mr. Justman described as a giant. The man's eyes were above the level of the passenger bar, and he had to keep his head bent to avoid hitting the roof. He was wearing an enormous backpack and carrying a large doll.</p>
        <p>The doll had very red lips, two great big eyes and brilliant red hair. The giant found his way to the rear of the bus, carefully avoiding the standees. Several stops later, the bus was still crowded, and as the doors prepared to open, passengers were startled to hear a plaintive cry in a young, girlish voice. ''Let me off, let me off,'' it said.</p>
        <p>Movement came to a standstill as everyone looked in the direction of the voice. There stood the giant with a big grin on his face, holding the doll, who was calling out. There was a moment of silence, then laughter, and everyone moved to give the two a clear path to the exit. When the man reached the street, he turned to face the door. The doll, no longer plaintive, called out, ''Thank you, good people, thank you.''</p>
        <p>As the bus pulled away, the man was surrounded, but it was the doll that got all the attention -- and questions.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>On my way from Jersey City to Manhattan, I was so engrossed in a novel that I left my bag carrying my rain boots on the PATH train. In a panic, I picked up the customer assistance telephone and told the woman at the other end of the line what had happened. She asked what train I had been on, I told her, she asked for a few more details and then instructed me to hold on. Finally, she said: ''We have the boots. Cross Sixth Avenue and pick up the phone at the downtown station entrance.'' I ran across and picked up the phone.</p>
        <p>''Boot guy?''</p>
        <p>''Yup,'' I said. The sign on the turnstile immediately switched from ''please pay'' to ''please enter,'' and I glided through. As a train arrived, I spotted the conductor and yelled, ''I'm the boot guy.'' He looked at me befuddled as I explained I had left my boots on the train. ''So get on board and look for them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>I entered and had started to search when a woman's voice came over the loudspeaker, echoing throughout the station: ''The boots are on the next train.''</p>
        <p>I waited, and when the train pulled in, the conductor was holding the boots out the window of his car. I thought then that even in New York, there is occasionally service reminiscent of small-town life.</p>
        <p>Now I just have to remember where I left my umbrella.</p>

        <p>HOP OUT IN THE MORNING</p>
        <p>From blue and white Fords</p>
        <p>And Cadillacs shiny,</p>
        <p>Wife-driven Jeeps</p>
        <p>And Volkswagens tiny,</p>
        <p>They hop out in the morning,</p>
        <p>Briefcases in hand,</p>
        <p>Overcoats buttoned,</p>
        <p>A kiss on demand.</p>
        <p>Goodbye for a day,</p>
        <p>A hug and a grin.</p>
        <p>I'll see you tonight</p>
        <p>When I return to hop in.</p>
        <p>LYNNE HAWES</p>
        <p>Sarah, the 4-year-old great-niece of Natalee S. Fogel and daughter of an author of well-known computer books, has found a new use for at least one of the computer keys. She recently told her father that she sometimes has nightmares. He replied that he was sorry, but she assured him that it was no longer a problem. ''Now if I have them, I just delete them,'' she said.</p>
