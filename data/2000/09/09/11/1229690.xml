        <p>RIVALRIES make for good sport, and in boxing there is a last remnant of an old fashioned Cold War-like battle of wills. The Cuban national boxing team, still shrouded in mystery because of the secrecy surrounding its training, is feared and respected. But this year's American team could be the strongest since the charismatic crew led by Sugar Ray Leonard in Montreal 24 years ago. The Americans have three reigning world champions, the Cubans have Felix Savon, the six-time world titlist, and two other world champions. The clash of these two powerful, experienced teams will highlight the competition at Sydney's Exhibition Center, but in boxing there are always surprises and enigmatic judging decisions -- enough twists and turns for a Tom Clancy novel.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- The one major change in these Games is that there will be four two-minute rounds separated by a one-minute rest period instead of three three-minute rounds with one minute in between. Unchanged, however, is the computerized scoring system where punches in bunches matter more than heavy power shots. A good jab delivered in a way that all five judges can see it is a more effective weapon than a sneaky, crunching left hook to the body that might be difficult to detect by the judges.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- It is extremely subjective, and some would say prejudiced. Computers were instituted to standardize the system, but the judges create the input for the computer, so there are wide discrepancies in how a bout is scored. Five judges have a computer score pad with buttons. The judges are supposed to hit the buttons, like players of a video game, every time they see a punch from a closed fist hit an opponent. If three of the five judges hit their buttons within one second of a punch, it is tabulated as a point for that boxer. The boxer with the most points at the end of the four rounds wins. Fights can be stopped if a boxer cannot continue, has been knocked out or disqualified. But it is the computerized scoring that remains at the hub of most judging controversies since the buttons test a judge's reflexes and because judges from different parts of the world put different values on different punching styles -- European judges, for example, are said to favor head blows and give less credence to body shots.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- A talented and veteran field returns, with 10 medalists from the Atlanta Games competing. Brian Viloria, the American entry at 106 pounds from Hawaii, has the best, if most obvious, nickname: Hawaiian Punch. Viloria is no joke, though; he's the world champ at his weight. The American Ricardo Juarez is another world champion, at 125 pounds. The featured matchup figures to be Savon against the American heavyweight Michael Bennett, a 29-year-old from Chicago who began amateur boxing less than two years ago. Bennett took up boxing while serving seven years in prison for armed robbery.</p>
        <p>Bennett is also the reigning world champion because Savon declined to get in the ring for their fight. Savon was protesting -- what else? -- a controversial judge's decision involving another Cuban boxer. The Cubans have several other talented fighters, including Mario Kindelan at 132 pounds and Juan Hernandez, the silver medalist at 147 pounds in 1996.</p>
