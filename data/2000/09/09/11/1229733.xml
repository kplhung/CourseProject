        <p>RETAILERS have always been ambivalent about close-out items. On the one hand, the racks of last season's worst sellers and returns are constant reminders of buying blunders, lost sales opportunities and wasted floor space. On the other hand, these goods can be magnets for some customers who might come to the store for bargains but leave with a carload of full-price items.</p>
        <p>On the Web, close-outs cause no such ambivalence. If the close-out items belong to the e-tailer, e-mail provides a cost-effective way to tell customers about the bargains and unload the goods quickly. And when merchants buy the close-outs from manufacturers and distributors at a steep discount, they can use those goods not only to expand their profit margins, but to lure existing customers back to the site.</p>

        <p>RETAILERS have always been ambivalent about close-out items. On the one hand, the racks of last season's worst sellers and returns are constant reminders of buying blunders, lost sales opportunities and wasted floor space. On the other hand, these goods can be magnets for some customers who might come to the store for bargains but leave with a carload of full-price items.</p>
        <p>On the Web, close-outs cause no such ambivalence. If the close-out items belong to the e-tailer, e-mail provides a cost-effective way to tell customers about the bargains and unload the goods quickly. And when merchants buy the close-outs from manufacturers and distributors at a steep discount, they can use those goods not only to expand their profit margins, but to lure existing customers back to the site.</p>
        <p>In fact, close-outs are becoming such a reliable source of revenue for Web merchants that a growing number of online stores are devoting entire sections of their sites to outlet-type offerings.</p>
        <p>''When you look at the ability of these online stores to reduce an item's price and disseminate that information to the right person at the right time, you really see the power of this,'' said Martha Rogers, partner at the Peppers &amp; Rogers Group, a Connecticut-based consulting firm. ''It's incredibly efficient for the company, and it's to the delight of the customer.''</p>
        <p>One of the pioneers of selling close-out items online is Recreational Equipment, which opened an online outlet (www.rei-outlet.com) in July 1998. Matt Hyde, vice president for online sales at REI, as the company is generally known, said REI considered opening a traditional outlet store in Seattle to handle close-outs. ''But because there are so many ebbs and flows of product,'' he said, REI decided to explore doing it online instead.</p>
        <p>''The outlet model works great on the Internet,'' Mr. Hyde said, because with close-out items ''you only have access to a limited number of product styles.'' For instance, he said, a bricks-and-mortar company might not want to spend time and effort buying and distributing 100 close-out pairs of size 13 boots to its stores, because they might not sell quickly. But it might make sense for an online outlet, which has fewer space constraints, a potentially larger customer base and the ability to inform people about the offer.</p>
        <p>Despite the seeming benefits of selling close-out goods online, e-commerce executives have paid close attention to see whether sales of such goods would steal sales from other parts of their sites. But so far, ''the cannibalization hasn't happened,'' Mr. Hyde said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hyde said REI chose to establish a separate site for its close-out and clearance items to underscore the message to consumers that they should not expect the same shopping experience at the outlet as at the REI.com site. The main REI site has an abundance of product information and offers a wide selection of goods with lifetime guarantees; the outlet site is light on product descriptions and other text, and the goods carry only 90-day guarantees. ''If we tried to do both on one site, it might hurt the brand,'' Mr. Hyde said.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Nordstrom.com features its Nordstrom Rack outlet store within the Nordstrom.com site, while promoting close-out items in other areas of the site, as well. ''The beauty of the Internet is that it allows multiple presentations of the same item at little or no cost,'' said Dan Nordstrom, chief executive of Nordstrom's Web division. ''We want to offer customers a variety of ways to get to the same item.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nordstrom said the company, which operates a catalog operation in addition to its 70 stores and 30  Nordstrom Rack outlets, could not necessarily fill the online outlet with close-out goods from each of its traditional stores. Because the company uses one distribution system for the  stores and another for its Web and catalog operations, it would be difficult for Nordstrom stores to profitably move close-out items to the online site.</p>
        <p>But moving goods from the catalog to the Web site is a different matter. ''Suddenly, now we can take that merchandise, and for a very minimal cost, sell it online, because we haven't had to print a single catalog or take a phone call,'' Mr. Nordstrom said.</p>
        <p>Moreover, when online retailers strike the right deals with manufacturers and other vendors of close-out items, their profit margins soar. Such is the case with KBKids.com, the online subsidiary of Consolidated Stores' K-BToys, which opened an outlet within its site earlier this year. David Novitsky, a KBKids.com vice president and its general merchandise manager, said that ''making 50 percent margin on a close-out item is pretty normal.'' Mr. Novitsky said that was partly because K-B Toys had built long-standing relationships with manufacturers, so the company  could buy large volumes of close-out goods and thereby lower its own product costs.</p>
        <p>Of course, not all online stores have the luxury of such long-standing relationships with multiple vendors, or warehouses to store the closed-out goods. But that does not necessarily prevent them from selling such items. Consider OurHouse.com, an Internet store that sells home improvement goods and furnishings. The company has no warehouse, and most of its goods -- including close-outs -- are shipped to customers by Ace Hardware, OurHouse.com's chief supplier.</p>
        <p>OurHouse.com began selling close-out items earlier this summer, with ''very good results,'' said Gary Briggs, the company's chief marketing officer. ''It definitely hasn't hurt the sales of full-price goods, and it helps keep people on the site,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As for whether the company would break out the clearance items into a separate area on the site, Mr. Briggs said, ''We just don't have the breadth of items yet to warrant that.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, other Internet companies with more years in the market and their own warehouses are starting to compete successfully with the bricks-and-mortar companies for close-out items -- to the relief of both their executives and investors. Egghead.com, a retailer of software, electronics and leisure products, which merged with Onsale.com late last year, is continuing to build the Smart Deals section of its site, featuring close-out items that it keeps in its own warehouses.</p>
        <p>Merle McIntosh, Egghead's senior vice president for merchandising, said, ''It's taken a long time and a lot of good performance to convince these manufacturers we're the place to go'' with close-out goods. That, in turn, has allowed Egghead to pursue a more profitable pricing strategy  than the ones that dominated the online electronics market last year, Mr. McIntosh said.</p>
        <p>Now, he said, the strategy is to lure bargain hunters to the site with the close-outs, while at the same time increasing the profit margins of Egghead's full-price goods. And although Egghead already sends e-mail to people on its subscriber list informing them of new deals, Mr. McIntosh said the company would also explore ways to notify its most profitable customers first.</p>
        <p>''Of course, given the state of this industry,'' he said, ''I don't know how you'd be able to identify a profitable customer.''</p>
