        <p>The federal government has announced tougher restrictions on building in wetlands within the New York City watershed.</p>
        <p>The new rules, involving wetlands as small as one-tenth of an acre east of the Hudson River, will mainly affect Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess Counties, said Joseph J. Seebode, an official with the Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
        <p>The new rules require developers to obtain federal permits for any new construction projects, including individual homes, in wetlands.</p>
        <p>Tiny pieces of wetlands, added together, can contribute to a region's water quality, said Jeffrey Odefey of Riverkeeper, a Hudson River environmental organization. ''These are critical little pieces,'' he said. ''There are lots of them, and together they provide filtration and flood control. They may seem like a puddle in somebody's backyard, but if it's near stream headwaters, it can affect the quality of the drinking water system.''</p>
        <p>Environmental organizations and the New York City Council have been lobbying for stronger federal protection of wetlands around the 1,969 square miles of watershed for months.</p>
        <p>In the vast watershed region west of the Hudson River, federal regulations, passed last spring and tougher than previous ones, will continue to apply.</p>
