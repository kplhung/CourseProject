        <p>CONTROVERSY surrounded selection of the United States Greco-Roman wrestling team when welterweight Matt Lindland protested the third match of his 2-1 loss to Keith Sieracki in the 167.5-pound class at July's Olympic trials.</p>
        <p>An arbitrator ruled that the match be rewrestled last month, and Lindland won, leading USA Wrestling to name Lindland to the Olympic team.</p>
        <p>The dispute eventually hit the courts. Last week, the Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens rejected a request by the United States Olympic Committee to keep Lindland off the team.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- Freestyle wrestlers can use their arms and legs for holds, but Greco-Roman wrestlers cannot use the legs to attack their opponents. Wrestlers are divided into eight weight classes for each style, from 119 to 286 pounds.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- Over the course of two three-minute rounds, wrestlers can score technical points for various holds, maneuvers or throws. A wrestler wins with a pin -- holding his opponent's shoulders to the mat for half a second, or by scoring 10 points more than his opponent. A winner must score at least 3 points to win a match. If there is a tie, the match enters a three-minute overtime. If the score is still tied, or neither wrestler has reached 3 points, a majority vote is taken by the referee, judge and mat chairman.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- There is one dominant wrestler: Aleksandr Karelin, the 286-pound Russian who has won three consecutive gold medals and nine world championships. In his trademark maneuver, he lifts opponents off the ground and throws them over his head. Karelin beat the American Matt Ghaffari for the 1996 gold.</p>
        <p>In Sydney, his leading opponents include Hector Milian of Cuba, Sergei Mourieko of Bulgaria and Giuseppe Giunta of Italy. Rulon Gardner, the American entrant in this weight class, is a two-time Pan American champion and three-time United States nationals winner.</p>
