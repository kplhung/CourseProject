        <p>Bowing to international pressure, a Palestinian leadership assembly decided tonight, as expected, to postpone a declaration of statehood and recommit to the Middle East peace effort despite deeply deadlocked negotiations.</p>
        <p>At the end of a two-day, closed-door meeting, the Palestinian Central Council did precisely what Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, wanted.</p>
        <p>The 129-member group backed down from its original pledge to declare an independent Palestinian state no later than Sept. 13 and then adjourned for up to two months, entrusting their statehood aspirations to Mr. Arafat and his senior advisers.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians' Sept. 13 deadline had shaped the sense of urgency that the parties felt during the Camp David summit meeting in July. But that sense of urgency withered over the subsequent weeks into a hollow threat of crisis. Mr. Arafat, whose emerging state is being bankrolled by the international community, traveled the world and failed to earn support for his deadline.</p>
        <p>Israel had said a statehood declaration would halt the peace effort, provoke its annexation of West Bank land and perhaps set off violent conflict. Speaking this morning on ABC television in New York, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel said he would welcome the delay even though he entertained ''no illusions'' about securing a final peace agreement that would end 52 years of bitter conflict.</p>
        <p>Nervous about their own back-pedaling, Palestinian officials worked hard to cast their decision as forward-thinking rather than as a defensive step.</p>
        <p>''Our right to declare a state is purely a Palestinian decision,'' said Nabil Shaath, a senior official. ''The delay serves to give peace yet another chance, and it is not for any fear of reprisals by anyone.''</p>
        <p>After President Clinton failed to budge the parties from their stalemate over the status of Jerusalem last week, the peace effort arrived at a serious impasse. But Mr. Arafat found himself this weekend with no other option than to recommit himself to negotiations that are not giving him what he wants.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen whether Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat will now agree to discuss a partial peace deal that leaves aside the thorniest subject; all sides say the issue of Jerusalem, in particular, appears to be intractable, making remote the prospects of a permanent peace agreement by year's end.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat told the assembly that Mr. Clinton had made a special appeal that the Palestinian negotiators redouble their efforts to reach an agreement in the next four to five weeks, participants said.</p>
        <p>''Although many are impatient, we will give the political leadership some breathing space to figure this all out,'' said Marwan Abdel Hamid, the Palestinians' deputy minister of housing. Using Mr. Arafat's nom de guerre, he added, ''There is trust in Abu Amar's wisdom and courage.''</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials said the peace talks would resume immediately, but the Israelis said no new talks had been scheduled. Still, they welcomed the expression of urgency by the Palestinians, having complained recently that the Palestinians seemed to feel no pressure to move speedily.</p>
        <p>Shlomo Ben Ami, the Israeli foreign minister, said, ''Sometimes one gets the impression that time is of no concern to the Palestinians.''</p>
        <p>In the course of today, some Palestinian officials appeared flummoxed, stumbling for words to explain how they plan to accomplish in the next two months what has eluded them for the last seven years. But others seemed enthused, ready to ground themselves in work, laying foundations for a state that would not have been ready next week.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian Central Council, for instance, asked Mr. Arafat and other leaders to work on a constitution, prepare for new elections and plan an application for admission to the United Nations.</p>
        <p>''It was a very healthy reaction, very responsible and very substantial,'' said Muhammad Nashashibi, the Palestinians' finance minister.</p>
        <p>In their final session of the weekend, according to participants, the Palestinian leaders furiously debated whether to announce a new deadline for statehood. While many were reluctant to leave their intentions open-ended, some said they preferred ambiguity to the posting of yet another deadline that could be broken. Today's deferral of statehood was the second in two years.</p>
        <p>''At a certain point, it gets absurd,'' a Palestinian official said. ''It gets embarrassing.''</p>
        <p>In the end, the Palestinians chose to be unclear. They threw another deadline into the mix, saying the assembly would reconvene by Nov. 15, the 12th anniversary of the original declaration of Palestinian independence in Algiers. Some officials said they could declare their state even earlier; others said Nov. 15 was not in any way binding.</p>
        <p>Many sandy streets away from the oceanfront presidential complex, some Palestinians said today that people would not tolerate a delay much beyond the end of the year -- although that is what they said last year when the May 4, 1999, declaration was postponed.</p>
        <p>''The Palestinians are ready to explode at any minute,'' said Muhammad Saafin, a security forces officer who was playing cards with his subordinates at a coffee shop. ''We feel inside like a soldier at the border waiting for the order to pull the trigger. By the end of the year, there will be no logic to waiting any longer. People will only get more radical.''</p>
        <p>Few in the West Bank or Gaza were hanging on the outcome of the Palestinian Central Council's meeting. Even the so-called rejectionist groups could not quite get up the enthusiasm to mount sustained protests, so certain were they of the postponement. ''Independence now,'' one man with a placard muttered as a small demonstration dribbled away this morning.</p>
        <p>While the Palestinian assembly was debating their future, five young women, all covered from head to toe in traditional Islamic dress, were busy peering into a Gaza store window at an otherworldly peach chiffon evening gown with plunging neckline. Giggling, they allowed themselves to be diverted.</p>
        <p>They were pharmacy students, serious and thoughtful, and they said they had never taken the Sept. 13 deadline seriously. Too many other deadlines had come and gone, they said. Once the international tide began turning against the Palestinians this summer, they said, they grew concerned about the fallout of a declaration: international isolation and specifically isolation in Gaza if Israel were to tighten its borders.</p>
        <p>''Everybody knows that you can't call it a state if only one party declares it,'' said Heba Hassan, 20. ''As a member of the third world, we can't make our decisions alone. There are so many countries that have influence over this declaration.''</p>
        <p>Her friend, Rana Muhammad, interrupted. ''The important thing is what kind of state we'll have, not when we will have it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Few Palestinians get their hopes up these days, based on too many previous experiences of having them dashed.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe any of their promises,'' said Kamil el-Solh, a retiree who was reading a newspaper in a cafe this afternoon. ''Nothing ever happens. Since 1948, nothing has happened. We are a stateless people. Care of -- that's our address. Care of what? Care of who? Who cares?''</p>
