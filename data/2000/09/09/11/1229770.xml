        <p>It was just another ho-hum supermarket promotion until the royals arrived in the cheese aisle.</p>
        <p>Then, quite suddenly yesterday, the diminutive D'Agostino market in Chelsea became a fanatically overscrutinized beachhead of international trade. To the astonishment of grocery shoppers, dozens of reporters and diplomats invaded the modest store to attend the visit of the fairytale couple that has dominated all those magazine covers and glossy photo spreads in Europe.</p>
        <p>At 2:38 p.m., the handsome Crown Prince Philippe of Belgium and his dazzling bride, Princess Mathilde, arrived in a nine-car motorcade that included five black Mercedeses and a police escort. For the couple, whose Brussels nuptials were celebrated in December as the last royal wedding of the millennium, it was Day 2 of a whirlwind five-day visit.</p>
        <p>No, they hadn't decided to try a little shopping-cart schlepping to enliven their giddy but overscheduled round of exclusive galas. Instead, their mission was to showcase Belgian products and industries while capitalizing on the growing visibility of things Belgian in New York City of late.</p>
        <p>''Who ever thought the Prince and Princess of Belgium would come to Chelsea and take a grape with us,'' said Zell Schwartzman, who lives a block from the store and was taking in the spectacle from the relative safety of the salad bar. She allowed that she was far from a Belgian novice ''because of my next door neighbor,'' Alphonsine Conolly, a Belgian who has lived in the United States for 41 years.</p>
        <p>''I wanted a picture of my prince,'' Ms. Conolly said, clutching her camera.</p>
        <p>And she began snapping as the royals made their way around the cozy 6,500-square-foot D'Agostino, on 23rd Street near Eighth Avenue, kicking off a celebration of Belgian products at the food chain's 24 stores, and incidentally furthering their mission to win the hearts, minds, media and market share of New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>But one grim reality did intrude: the news that a cousin of Prince Philippe, Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg, had been severely injured in a car crash yesterday. ''It is a great shock; he is in a coma,'' Prince Philippe said in an interview. ''If it becomes more grave, we may return.''</p>
        <p>In the interim, the 40-year-old prince belied his reputation for reticence by chatting up folks at displays of Belgian chocolate, Belgian marmalade and Belgian beer.</p>
        <p>The royals had been welcomed on Saturday at Kennedy International Airport by reporters and news crews (40 had accompanied them from Brussels on a military jet, where the couple broke all precedent by chatting at length with them).</p>
        <p>At a reception Saturday night for 350 of the metropolitan region's 8,000 Belgians at Markt, the glam Belgian bistro in the meatpacking district, the royals stepped through intermittent showers to face the multitude. ''This rain is very Belgian,'' said Danielle Kurz, the Belgian-born owner of the Belgian gallery Artwall + B, in Rutherford, N.J. ''But there, the rain would be colder.''</p>
        <p>The royal couple navigated the crowds confidently and chatted easily with Belgian subjects as well as American admirers, some of whom seemed positively royal-struck. There were actually flustered curtsies and a few ''Your Majesties'' and a ''Highness'' or two. But in fact, according to Belgian consulate officials, the prince and princess -- as Belgium's future, not present, monarchs -- are to be addressed as ''monseigneur'' and ''madame.''</p>
        <p>The prince sipped a glass of Stella Artois beer during the meet-and-greet at Markt, while 27-year-old Princess Mathilde worked the room to unrestrained admiration. Although some have likened Princess Mathilde to the model Claudia Schiffer or Diana, Princess of Wales, ''I don't see that,'' said Jerry Lucadamo, a Westchester teacher who had been invited to the reception with his Belgian wife. He explained: ''I think she's so Grace Kelly.''</p>
        <p>In an interview yesterday in a Belgian restaurant, Le Pain Quotidien, the prince expressed his satisfaction that in the three years since his last New York visit ''the economic boom is now visible everywhere.''</p>
        <p>And Belgium wants to contribute to it. To honor the royal visit, one luxury Brussels fabric maker, Scabal, is exporting a new woolen product it calls ''diamond chip.'' At $1,000 a yard, it is blended with microscopic pieces of diamond from Antwerp. ''The diamonds are wrapped around the threads,'' said Scabal's American agent, Neal Boyarsky. ''You see, that is why the fabric doesn't cut people's skin.''</p>
