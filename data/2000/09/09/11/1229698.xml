        <p>Normally, the effusive Bela Karolyi rambles on in glorious hyperbole but in such a thick Transylvanian accent, a toy decoder ring is required to untangle his words. But after watching Shannon Miller's comeback at the United States Olympic Trials last month end with an inglorious fall, and seeing three other top gymnasts take spills on the balance beam in Boston, Karolyi was short on words.</p>
        <p>The finish to the trials in mid-August seemed to unnerve him. Once Karolyi, the national team coordinator, announced the Olympic team -- which included two members of the 1996 gold medal team, Amy Chow and Dominique Dawes -- he quickly discussed the difficult subjective selection process and exited the room.</p>
        <p>''We can contend for a medal,'' Karolyi said as he departed. ''We have to work.''</p>
        <p>That meant the gymnasts were about to experience even more intensive training back at his ranch in the outback of Texas. Less than a year ago, this out-of-the-way place was his retirement home of sorts.</p>
        <p>Just after the 1996 gold medal team of miracle pixies ended its talk-show tour of the States, Karolyi, the bombastic architect of the squad, ambled away from the scene as quietly as an old grizzly disappearing into his cave.</p>
        <p>Karolyi's work was done, or so he believed. The man who massaged the souls and defined the power in Nadia Comaneci and Mary Lou Retton was at peace with his body of work and living in obscurity on his exotic 1,200-acre retreat 75 miles north of Houston. Before he defected to the United States from Romania in 1981, America had won only one medal in women's gymnastics. Once he began his demanding approach -- interspersed with bearhugs along the way -- the women found their way to the podium for 18 medals.</p>
        <p>Karolyi thought the foundation of USA Gymnastics was secure. On his expansive piece of forest, he could enjoy a ranch life that Michael Jackson might envy. On land shared by antelope and emus, llamas and geese, the eccentric Karolyi and his wife Marta were ready to vanish from the spotlight.</p>
        <p>But last October, Karolyi was shaken by an American free fall in gymnastics. With the Magnificent Seven in retirement, a group of tentative, naive gymnasts finished sixth at the 1999 World Championships.</p>
        <p>''It was terrible, just unbelievable and spectacular failure,'' Karolyi said. ''I don't know why it was so poor. It was everything going down the drain. If I am there, I would be eating my fingers. I would be doing something.''</p>
        <p>But Karolyi was not there. And without him, there was a fear that the team would not be mentally fit and medal-ready for Sydney. After the 1996 team competition in Atlanta drew huge television audiences, and after Kerri Strug became an American folk hero with her courageous vault, there was pressure on USA Gymnastics to provide NBC with a strong first week to these Olympics.</p>
        <p>And there was the pride of the program at stake as well. The USA Gymnastics president, Bob Colarossi, boarded a plane to Houston, pulled Karolyi out of retirement and began a feverish approach to resurrecting the American gymnasts.</p>
        <p>''In 1996, that's when our team walked on the floor and now became the reigning all-around Olympic champion,'' Karolyi said. ''It was a showcase of the incredible. This challenge is no less important.''</p>
        <p>Since January, America's top gymnasts have made monthly journeys to Karolyi's ranch, where a state-of-the-art gym shares space on the retreat. Although Karolyi's controversial taskmaster approach to building great gymnasts has been questioned by a hoard of critics, as well as by some coaches, who feel he pushes athletes too hard, this is the man USA Gymnastics needed to give the team a chance.</p>
        <p>''I don't always know what he's yelling when I'm going through my routine,'' the waifish team member Morgan White said. ''But he gets the best out of you. For some reason, you just respond to him. The next thing you know, you've done better than you ever have. His method works.''</p>
        <p>Elise Ray and Kristen Maloney responded as well. And with increased time in the gym, Dawes and Chow began to reveal the same talents that made them a part of the Magnificent Seven in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''Back in January, I looked and saw their little hearts still beating, but they were missing confidence and fire,'' Karolyi said. ''And they were missing the physical readiness.''</p>
        <p>But was Karolyi's arrival too late? Although the team's results in international competition improved dramatically just four months after his return, there were a few letdowns at the Olympic trials, a few missteps that left room for concern. Karolyi appeared taken aback but still positive that the goal could be reached.</p>
        <p>''We want to create a beautiful image on the floor,'' Karolyi said. ''I believe this can be a beautiful team, a strong team. I believe this will be a proud effort.''</p>
        <p>If Karolyi can will this team to a medal, it might one of the greatest feats of his career.</p>
