        <p>The overmatched college players wanted to pay homage after being beaten by more than 60 points by Team USA. They were not searching for a Women's National Basketball Association player of the week, however. After quickly shaking the hands of Lisa Leslie and Sheryl Swoopes, the young players kept moving through the arena corridor.</p>
        <p>They wanted something more lasting and permanent, which is why they sought out T.</p>
        <p>''Bye, baby,'' Teresa Edwards said, waving to each player.</p>
        <p>The slew of college players waved and thanked her for competing against them.</p>
        <p>''Nice playing with you guys,'' Edwards said. ''Good luck to you. I'll be watching you all.''</p>
        <p>She tossed her braided locks over the stars and stripes of the warm-up jacket on her left shoulder, slung her Team USA duffel bag over her right shoulder and trudged on out to the team charter bus for another ride back to another hotel.</p>
        <p>There is a flight to Australia in the morning and another Olympics to compete in next week -- her fifth in 16 years. At age 36, and with little left to give the game physically, the veteran point guard is tired. But Edwards is also unbent.</p>
        <p>''At this point, I can ride the boat or drive it,'' she said. ''It doesn't matter. I just want to win.''</p>
        <p>Age, a defunct league (the American Basketball League) and contractual disagreements with the W.N.B.A. have conspired against Edwards during the last two years. Instead of flying downcourt on Lifetime television and enjoying the novelty and early popularity of American women's professional basketball, she is a virtual outsider.</p>
        <p>Cynthia Cooper is lauded as the greatest to play the game. Michele Timms and her peroxide-blonde thatch elicits a cult following. But Edwards drifts further toward retirement and anonymity.</p>
        <p>Twice in two years Edwards tried to come to terms with a W.N.B.A. franchise, but the league was unwilling to pay a four-time Olympian more than a standard player's share.</p>
        <p>If female players had more bargaining power and clout, Edwards would be Norma Rae in hightops. But the N.B.A. umbrella is too large. In that vein, she is viewed as a troublemaker, ruining a good thing for the girls.</p>
        <p>''I think her country has done a disservice to her,'' said Dawn Staley, a close friend on the Olympic team.</p>
        <p>''You look at Hortencia from Brazil,'' Staley said of Hortencia Marcari Oliva. ''She's the queen of Brazil. And yet T, she's relatively unknown. And she's played in five Olympics.</p>
        <p>''You know why? She stands by things she says and does. I take my hat off to her for not playing in the W.N.B.A. and maybe not giving in to what she thinks she deserves to play the game. That's probably why people don't embrace her. She's a woman of her word. And sometimes, people can't handle that.''</p>
        <p>Edwards said, ''I respect my game and myself too much to settle for what they were willing to pay me.''</p>
        <p>In the 1984 United States Olympic basketball team photo, the first woman on the left standing in the back row looking slightly in awe, standing next to Lynette Woodard and Cheryl Miller, is Edwards, her life and career in front of her. At 20, she was the youngest member of the first American United States women's team to win a gold medal.</p>
        <p>Edwards's teammates have literally intersected eras and generations. Between 1983 and 1991, the international teams she played on won 46 straight games. She played professionally for nine years overseas in Italy, France, Spain and Japan.</p>
        <p>''Times have changed,'' Edwards said. ''We didn't have pro leagues and now we do. You lived overseas, and no one knew who you were until the Olympics rolled around in those years. Also, we've been given the opportunity to truly be athletes as well as women. And that's a new road to travel.''</p>
        <p>Before the A.B.L. folded in 1998, Edwards scored 40 points or more four times in the league's two-plus seasons, when she coached and played for Atlanta and then Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Against Cuba in the 1992 Summer Olympics, she made seven 3-pointers, and she distributed a record 15 assists against Australia at the 1996 Summer Games, which were played close to her hometown of Cairo, Ga.</p>
        <p>Edwards, the most decorated Olympic basketball player, has an opportunity to win her fourth gold medal at Sydney. She does not feel forgotten.</p>
        <p>''In some shape, form or fashion, I've had something to do with the W.N.B.A. by playing in the A.B.L.,'' Edwards said. ''I don't think it would have been taken as serious if no one else tried it. I will always tell myself I had something to do with that.''</p>
        <p>Edwards added: ''They hear about me, trust me. They just don't hear about me in the same light. It doesn't bother me. I'm getting exactly what I deserve. There are no expectations on my behalf that anybody owes me anything based on my accomplishments. That's not who I am.''</p>
        <p>Edwards also has no illusions about her value to the league as a marquee player.</p>
        <p>''My time has come and gone, as far as I'm concerned,'' she said. ''I wish that the ones with the power and the marketing and the values on their names, I wish they knew the values of the players that built this. That's what I wish. Because if they did, then they would come together.''</p>
        <p>Edwards's production has waned, but she is not done. Leading the break during an exhibition in Hawaii last week, she stutter-stepped downcourt, waiting for Swoopes, her cutting teammate, to come open for a layup. Edwards fed the Houston Comets All-Star as she once fed Miller years ago, the ball delivered on the fingertips, in stride.</p>
        <p>''T is so competitive,'' Staley said. ''We played HORSE today. And I beat her. And the look she gave me when she lost. I would not trade that in for anything. Money. Anything. She still has that drive.''</p>
        <p>In Sydney, the American women's team will be severely tested by Australia, Brazil, Russia and Cuba. Another gold medal is not a certainty. And yet, after the Games are over and Edwards moves on, there will still be more opponents.</p>
        <p>''Personally, I do feel like I'm on the outside,'' Edwards said. ''The athletes are just sitting on the shelf in the store. We're the product. That's the way it is. They have to change things like free agency. The danger is, if they step up too aggressively, will David Stern and everyone on top say no to the league? You really have no power. It's a Catch-22.</p>
        <p>''You step up, you don't want to play because of certain issues. Now, will the public get behind you, because you're a player who feels as if you're not being treated right? That sentiment isn't there. If they do step up, they have to have the public behind them. The right people, the right lawyers, all of that. And I don't think America is ready for that. It's not a good risk for the young girls to take right now. But I think if the momentum keeps growing, they do have to stand up for themselves eventually.''</p>
        <p>''But once again, you're talking about young women who have made more money than they have ever made in their life, even though it's a fraction of what the men make.''</p>
        <p>On the way out of the arena last week, W.N.B.A. stars such as Leslie, Swoopes and Nikki McCray drew more of a crowd than Edwards. After acknowledging the awed collection of college players, Edwards quietly slipped past a small crowd of autograph seekers and onto the bus.</p>
        <p>''I'm in the right time and in the right place,'' she said. ''Everybody says I'm too late. I feel good. I didn't miss the boat. I'm the type of player that likes to make waves and be different. I'm not afraid to be on the battle lines.</p>
        <p>''I'll dig the hole. Everybody else can come through.''</p>
