      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Sometimes jazz groups have their own messy, expansive personalities, bigger than the compositions they're playing. This was the case with Donny McCaslin's quartet, which played at Smalls on Tuesday night. Its musicians can do many things, but they elected to construct a thick mesh of music that negotiated around jazz and funk and rock.</p>
        <p>The sound of the band -- the same lineup heard on Mr. McCaslin's new album, ''Seen From Above'' (Arabesque) -- starts in its rhythm section. Jim Black, best known these days for his work with Dave Douglas and Tim Berne, is a clattering drummer who puts considerable technique into making jazz rhythms sound strange: abrupt and imbalanced, with rude slaps on his dry, papery-sounding cymbals. When he's in his element, you wouldn't call him a groove player; his talent is to build tension rather than ease it. And though the early set included a misty ballad and a midtempo jazz tune, grooves -- even New Orleans-style grooves in ''Second Line Sally'' -- were the main focus.</p>

        <p>Sometimes jazz groups have their own messy, expansive personalities, bigger than the compositions they're playing. This was the case with Donny McCaslin's quartet, which played at Smalls on Tuesday night. Its musicians can do many things, but they elected to construct a thick mesh of music that negotiated around jazz and funk and rock.</p>
        <p>The sound of the band -- the same lineup heard on Mr. McCaslin's new album, ''Seen From Above'' (Arabesque) -- starts in its rhythm section. Jim Black, best known these days for his work with Dave Douglas and Tim Berne, is a clattering drummer who puts considerable technique into making jazz rhythms sound strange: abrupt and imbalanced, with rude slaps on his dry, papery-sounding cymbals. When he's in his element, you wouldn't call him a groove player; his talent is to build tension rather than ease it. And though the early set included a misty ballad and a midtempo jazz tune, grooves -- even New Orleans-style grooves in ''Second Line Sally'' -- were the main focus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Black reined in his wilder impulses, but there were plenty of rhythmic seizures in the music. Intercepting his style, complementing it and simultaneously making it bend more toward a workable standard of jazz rhythm was the bassist Scott Colley. He's a calm, delicate player whose notes tend to be modest and precisely articulated.</p>
        <p>On guitar was Ben Monder, whose track record suggests that he's aiming for a frame of reference in jazz as wide as Pat Metheny's. Here he was playing soft electric guitar made dirty with distortion, strumming chords as jagged backgrounds for Mr. McCaslin; it was rock-style guitar, except for some speed-flash arpeggios and reharmonizations. And Mr. McCaslin, out front, played in a rapid, bravado saxophone style that has become a language among younger players in New York: he used long breath lines that made a point of racing up and down between the extremes of the horn's pitch.</p>
        <p>The set hit its natural apex during Mr. McCaslin's solo in the last piece, ''Manresa.'' It was all-out playing; the musicians reached a plateau of dense, loud rocking -- they didn't let the music breathe and didn't want to -- and kept it up for about five full, transfixing minutes.</p>
