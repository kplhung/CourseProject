        <p>Sidney Quick is an inmate at the Wallkill Correctional Facility in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>He is there on merit. Mr. Quick is a hideously violent man who spent as much time as he could getting high on booze, crack, powdered cocaine, heroin and LSD. We know quite a bit about him, including the fact that he slept with an automatic weapon by his pillow, robbed men and women at gunpoint, once held a gun to the head of his wife's daughter, robbed one of his in-laws at gunpoint, held up drug dealers, shot a man who was slow to respond in one of his robberies and was a suspect in the murder of a drug dealer.</p>
        <p>Once, when asked under oath how many people he had robbed in the year 1993, Quick nastily replied, ''I didn't carry a calculator with me.''</p>
        <p>We also know -- and the authorities have known for a very long time -- that Quick is a world-class liar. So you would think there would be some reluctance on the part of the police and prosecutors to use his word, and his word alone, to wreck the career and ruin the life of a New York City police detective with a spotless record.</p>
        <p>Not only did the authorities listen to Quick, they sought him out and encouraged him to actually implicate the detective in a murder.</p>
        <p>The detective is named Zaher Zahrey. He worked undercover in narcotics in Brooklyn, and was known to his friends and colleagues as Zack.</p>
        <p>On March 16, 1995, two detectives from the Internal Affairs Bureau, Sgt. Robert Boyce and Sgt. Michael McWilliams, went to visit Quick at Sing Sing Prison in Ossining. Their goal was to get something -- anything -- on Zack.</p>
        <p>Incredibly, they recorded their encounter with Quick. So, in a conversation about the murder of a drug dealer named J. R. Guadalupe -- a murder in which Mr. Quick was a prime suspect -- we actually get to listen in on the deliberate debasement of the criminal justice system. We hear Sergeant Boyce telling Quick, ''If you give me Zack, I'll drive you home.'' We hear him say, ''If you tell me Zack was there when J. R. was killed, he's [expletive] and, and you are looking at a very sweet deal.''</p>
        <p>Sergeant Boyce wanted there to be no mistake. He said to Sidney Quick: ''The deal is Zack. That's what your deal is. You understand that?''</p>
        <p>Quick understood. He said Zack most certainly was involved in the murder, and other crimes too.</p>
        <p>There was no other evidence, mind you. And plenty of evidence that Quick was lying. But that didn't matter. With Quick and his lies in tow, investigators tried to build a case against Detective Zahrey, first in the office of the Brooklyn district attorney, and then, when that didn't work, in the office of the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District, which prosecuted the detective on federal charges.</p>
        <p>Detective Zahrey was arrested and spent nine months in jail. A jury saw through the madness and, after deliberating only a few minutes, acquitted him in June 1997.</p>
        <p>That should have been the end of Detective Zahrey's ordeal. But more than two years after his acquittal, police officials decided to go ahead with a departmental trial based on Quick's malignant fantasies.</p>
        <p>''I tried to convince the departmental prosecutor that they should not go forward because the case was so ludicrous,'' said Joel Rudin, Detective Zahrey's lawyer.</p>
        <p>But the trial was held anyway, and it ended the same way the federal trial had ended -- with Detective Zahrey's acquittal. The Police Department trial commissioner wrote: ''The only testimony proffered by the department to show that [Zahrey] participated in an attempted kidnapping of Guadalupe, which eventuated in his death, was the testimony of Sidney Quick. None of the other witnesses who testified offered any evidence which in any way linked the respondent to this crime and none of the physical evidence introduced connected the respondent to any aspect of this crime.''</p>
        <p>The commissioner's findings were made official on July 21.</p>
        <p>But if Detective Zahrey thought his exoneration would place him back in the good graces of the department, he was wrong. The department has refused to return his gun and his badge and has not restored the pay he lost while he was in jail. He remains on modified duty, inventorying seized vehicles at the automobile pound in Whitestone, Queens.</p>
