        <p>The final of the World Team Championships which ended on Saturday in Maastricht, the Netherlands, was one of the most exciting in the history of the game. The Italians seemed to be heading for a comfortable victory, but their Polish opponents fought back and were leading by 10 imps with seven deals remaining. A final surge gave a victory by 20 to the Italians: Norberto Bocchi, Giorgio Duboin, Lorenzo Lauria and Alfredo Versace.</p>
        <p>The United States Women's Team captured their world title on Friday night by defeating Canada in the final. In the diagramed deal the usual contract was six spades by North, reached whether or not West chose a pre-emptive opening. But there were two exceptions.</p>
        <p>In the Women's Teams, Shawn Quinn and Mildred Breed were North and South for the United States, and the bidding followed the course shown. The two-club response was game-forcing, so South was able to mark time with two no-trump at her second turn. North's enthusiasm for spades made it obvious that she had at least a seven-card suit, and South was now interested in a grand slam. She gave up on that possibility when the five-heart indicated that North held two key cards, the diamond ace and the spade king, but lacked the spade queen.</p>
        <p>A new element entered the equation when West contributed a double. This was a Lightner, suggesting a strong desire for a specific lead. The usual motivation is a void suit, and in this case East would have looked for her long suit. A diamond would have given West a ruff; but as it happens, that would not have defeated the contract. The ruff would have used up West's potential trump trick.</p>
        <p>But if West had held Q x x x of trumps, together with the diamond void, the ruff would have defeated the slam. Breed therefore made a good decision. She retreated to six no-trump, which was unbeatable. After a heart lead, she unblocked the spade ace, crossed to the diamond ace and led the spade king. She surrendered a trick to the spade queen and claimed her contract.</p>
        <p>The other variation was in the Poland-Italy match. The Polish West opened three hearts, crowding the bidding, and the Italian North-South overreached slightly by attempting seven no-trump. This hinged on the spade queen, and had about a 50-50 chance of success, somewhat less than the required odds for a grand slam. The gamble failed, and Poland gained 14 imps. If the spade queen had fallen conveniently, Italy would have gained 11.</p>
