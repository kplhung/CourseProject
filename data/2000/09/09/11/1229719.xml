        <p>On Thursday night at the MTV Music Video awards. Down on the stage of Radio City Music Hall a rap artist hip-hopped around with the back of his pants worn at thigh level, revealing his gray undies in all their glory. One band performed accompanied by dozens of gyrating midgets. A host exposed his naked rear end on camera.</p>
        <p>At one point, an interloper climbed up an artsy stage decoration and rocked it dangerously until he was violently removed by a security detail.</p>
        <p>Up in the first mezzanine, where Champagne and lobster were served, things were calmer. The top executives of MTV's parent company, Viacom, including the president, Mel Karmazin, fully attired in business suits, pants belted at their waists, to all appearances enjoying the show.</p>
        <p>Culture clash? Far from it. The executives know a hit when they see one, even if the ratings for this year's show, shown live on MTV, did not live up to the high-water mark set last year. The drop-off from 11.94 million viewers, to 9.85 million, was still the second-highest viewership in the show's history and the most-watched entertainment show on cable in 2000.</p>
        <p>Between acts, the talk was of the expanding opportunities for synergy between the merged media assets of Viacom and the company that Mr. Karmazin brought with him to Viacom one year ago this month, CBS.</p>
        <p>Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television, revealed that in the finale of ''Survivor,'' for the first time ever, CBS had allowed a cable company to purchase a commercial promoting a cable show by specific date and time. ''It was for this show,'' Mr. Moonves said, referring to the MTV Awards. ''We did it because MTV is in the family now.''</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, Mr. Moonves encountered Herb Scannell, president of another Viacom cable channel, Nickelodeon. ''How's my Saturday morning?'' Mr. Moonves asked. Nickelodeon is supplying the children's programming for CBS's Saturday morning schedule this fall.</p>
        <p>A moment later, John Sykes, the president of VH-1, joined the group, announcing that VH-1 would rebroadcast several concerts scheduled on CBS, including ones with Faith Hill and Tina Turner.</p>
        <p>CBS has also contracted with one of MTV's biggest stars, Carson Daly, to develop shows for him on that network and Richard Hatch, the million-dollar ''Survivor,'' turned up as a presenter on the MTV awards.</p>
        <p>The programming on Viacom channels is promoted regularly on the Infinity radio stations, Mr. Karmazin's original media holding.</p>
        <p>Gil Schwartz, chief corporate spokesman for CBS, said Mr. Karmazin's presence fit in precisely with his strategy to meld all the Viacom media assets.</p>
        <p>''Besides,'' he said, ''in his heart, he's the owner of rock 'n' roll radio stations.''</p>
