        <p>Recently I was asked if anything about doping in sports has changed since the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.

        <p>Recently I was asked if anything about doping in sports has changed since the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. My initial instinct was to say no, since there will still be drugs at the Olympics this year. But something has changed: The public has learned even more about this epidemic, including the recent revelations about doping programs of the Chinese and the East Germans, as well as drug use by Tour de France participants.</p>
        <p>When drug scandals erupted in the 1970's and 1980's, the International Olympic Committee would tell the public: Yes, we had a small problem before, but now we have fixed it. Increasingly frequent reports of drug use, however, coupled with the stories of bribery of I.O.C. delegates by cities, have both eroded the credibility of that response and sent the committee scrambling to rehabilitate its image.</p>
        <p>The latest version of the ''now we have it fixed'' strategy is the World Anti-Doping Agency, held out as independent of the I.O.C. but led by an I.O.C. vice president. The agency conducts frequent random unannounced testing of athletes, no matter where they are. The I.O.C. also recently unveiled two tests for a previously undetectable drug, erythropoietin, or EPO,  which enhances endurance.</p>
        <p>Skeptics note that to show up on the test, EPO would have to have been taken in the previous three or four days, while its optimal use for performance requires injection several weeks before competition. And then there is the glaring absence of effective tests for other popular performance-enhancing drugs like testosterone, human growth hormone and an insulin-like growth factor.</p>
        <p>An effective response to the doping epidemic would be to establish an independent organization of doctors, chemists, lawyers and others -- none of them either opponents or proponents of the Olympic movement -- to set up fair and equitable testing and sanctions, regardless of athletes' fame or nationality. Then the I.O.C. and its member federations should make a five-year commitment to support year-round drug testing and pledge at least $100 million to develop tests for now undetectable drugs.</p>
        <p>If this idea -- or at least the $100 million -- sounds like pie in the sky, consider this. During the next 10 years or so, doping as we currently know it might be eclipsed by the genetic re-engineering of high-performance adult bodies -- injecting a virus to deliver modified genes that increase red blood cell production, for example.</p>
        <p>That could leave us with two bad choices: surrender to the inevitable and watch athletes take full advantage of the wonders of science in full public view, or continue the hypocrisy of making feeble attempts to catch cheaters while proclaiming the purity of the Games.</p>
