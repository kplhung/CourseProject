        <p>In Olympic television terms, NBC is a tyranny, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation a democracy.</p>
        <p>NBC will tape every minute of the Sydney Games and package the best for a five-hour prime-time show.</p>
        <p>All of NBC's morning and late-night coverage will be taped, as will everything broadcast on CNBC and MSNBC.</p>
        <p>In essence, NBC will show you what it believes you want to see.</p>
        <p>NBC even has minute-by-minute surveys that prove what you want and when you surf away when you're shown what you don't want. So if you don't like what you see at 10:45 p.m., you must not be in the majority.</p>
        <p>CBC will carry everything live. So march northward, you purists -- you viewers who want results now, not 10 or 12 or 15 hours later -- to Buffalo, Seattle, Detroit or Minneapolis, anywhere close enough to the Canadian border to grab a CBC signal.</p>
        <p>''CBS tried to block out the CBC feed coming from Vancouver during Nagano,'' said Christian Haase, a spokesman for CBC, referring to the 1998 Winter Olympics from Japan. ''People from the U.S. write to thank us for showing the Olympics live.''</p>
        <p>If you're in Buffalo, you can watch the opening ceremony from Sydney at 3:45 a.m. Eastern time. Or tune in to the women's 100-meter sprint final on Sept. 23 at 5:05 a.m. and the men's 100 meter final 15 minutes later. That men's 50-meter freestyle swimming final you're looking for? That will be at 4:05 a.m. on Sept. 22.</p>
        <p>By Oct. 1, with your body clock adjusted, watching the closing ceremony at 4 a.m. should be no problem.</p>
        <p>This is the CBC way, and it is proud not to do it the NBC way.</p>
        <p>''With so much information available and the Internet, it's important to show it live,'' Hasse said. ''People here are used to watching men's Olympic hockey at 2 a.m. or the men's 100 meter final at 5:20. It's two-and-a-half weeks of magic.''</p>
        <p>Hasse said that during the 1998 Winter Olympics from Nagano, CBC attracted 2.3 million viewers for the Canada-Czech Republic semifinal hockey game, from 12:40 to 3:30 a.m. By comparison, the prime-time ''Hockey Night in Canada,'' attracts an average viewership of 1.3 million.</p>
        <p>CBC will carry some taped highlights of wee-hour action during its morning show, from 9 a.m. to noon. In its afternoon and prime-time broadcasts, from 5 to 11 p.m., CBC will show 288 hours of live coverage, augmented by more than 200 hours from TSN, a second Canadian network.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that CBC is paying $20 million for the rights to the Sydney Games, compared with NBC's fee of $705 million.</p>
        <p>CBC viewers have a great advantage: the network's relatively modest investment doesn't require it to time-shift the prime stuff to prime time in order to earn back a gigantic rights fee.</p>
        <p>And if viewers look forward to track and field in the wee hours, that is their choice.</p>
        <p>''I think people are past time changes,'' Joel Darling, CBC's Olympic executive producer, told The National Post, a Toronto newspaper. ''If they want to see something, they want to see it.''</p>
        <p>But it is imperative for NBC to husband the best events for maximum exposure and advertising rates for prime time. All those NBC promotions urging viewers to watch marquee athletes like Maurice Greene, Marion Jones, Lenny Krayzelburg, Ian Thorpe or Stacy Dragila would be useless if the come-ons urged: ''Join us in Sydney at 4 in the morning!'' You simply can't build a broad TV viewership out of Joe Benigno's overnight listeners on WFAN.</p>
        <p>''With virtually all of the finals of track and field, swimming, diving and gymnastics taking place in the evening hours in Sydney,'' said Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, ''the decision was made early on with these Olympics that our most important target was to reach the largest possible audience.''</p>
        <p>That audience exists in greatest numbers between 7 p.m. and midnight Eastern time, not at 3 a.m. when an estimated 9 percent of television sets in the United States are on.</p>
        <p>To alter that equation by carrying an Olympics from a site 15 hours away would be folly for NBC, as long as the network pays what the International Olympic Committee wants. NBC, of course, made a pre-emptive bid for the Sydney and 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympic rights in 1995 for a combined $1.2 billion, then returned a few months later with a $2.3 billion offer for the 2004, 2006 and 2008 rights. Had NBC not come forward, the I.O.C. likely would have sought more in competitive bidding.</p>
        <p>The I.O.C. and the Olympic movement could live easily without the CBC's money, but not NBC's.</p>
        <p>For Sydney, NBC's $705 million payment accounts for 52.9 percent of the worldwide TV rights. CBC accounts for 1.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Four years ago in Atlanta, NBC's $456 million payment provided 50.7 percent of the $898.3 million total.</p>
        <p>Much as NBC is certain that its taped strategy will work, it will be challenged more than ever by the Internet, which is more important and pervasive than even two years ago at the Nagano Winter Games.</p>
        <p>Various Web sites, including nbcolympics.com, will make results instantly available, and photographs will be widely posted.</p>
        <p>NBC must hope that its bedrock philosophy -- that viewers are more interested in the Games' video imagery and stories of athletic sacrifice, triumph and failure than in who won or lost -- continues to be viable.</p>
