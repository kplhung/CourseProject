        <p>THE 1996 American team had high expectations in its home waters, but managed only two bronze medals in Savannah, Ga. The United States squad hopes to return to prominence in Sydney. In 1992, the team claimed nine medals in 10 classes.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- Ten of the 11 classes compete in strict fleet-racing formats, where the first boat to finish wins the race and scores 1 point. Second place earns 2 points, and so on. Competition in each event is based on an 11-race series, weather permitting, with the exception of the 49er Class, which sails 16 races. The winner is the boat with the lowest accumulated score at the end of the series. After 10 races, each boat discards its worst two scores. The Soling Class will run six fleet races and the top 12 boats will advance to a boat-versus-boat match-racing tournament.</p>

        <p>THE 1996 American team had high expectations in its home waters, but managed only two bronze medals in Savannah, Ga. The United States squad hopes to return to prominence in Sydney. In 1992, the team claimed nine medals in 10 classes.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- Ten of the 11 classes compete in strict fleet-racing formats, where the first boat to finish wins the race and scores 1 point. Second place earns 2 points, and so on. Competition in each event is based on an 11-race series, weather permitting, with the exception of the 49er Class, which sails 16 races. The winner is the boat with the lowest accumulated score at the end of the series. After 10 races, each boat discards its worst two scores. The Soling Class will run six fleet races and the top 12 boats will advance to a boat-versus-boat match-racing tournament.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- Early springtime weather conditions can present a variety of conditions, from stiff offshore westerlies to light, shifty sea breezes. With winds apt to bend unpredictably around the many harbor headlands, and currents that in places can run up to a knot-and-a-half, successful skippers will need to employ clean starts and adapt quickly to the situations.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- In the Star Class, the American Mark Reynolds, the reigning world champion skipper, will face stiff competition from Brazil's Torben Grael and the hometown favorite, the Australian Colin Beashel. In the Laser Class, Britain's Ben Ainslie; the Brazilian Robert Scheidt; and another Aussie, Michael Blackburn, are expected to wage an epic battle. In the 49er Class, the brothers Jonathan and Charlie McKee should be strong medal contenders.</p>
