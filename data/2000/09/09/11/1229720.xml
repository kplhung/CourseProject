        <p>WHILE awaiting a license to practice medicine in New York, Pepi Dakov spent several years driving a taxi around the city for 50 hours a week, working two jobs at once: ferrying passengers and envisioning a way to mend severed blood vessels without sutures.</p>
        <p>Now the Bulgarian immigrant, who has since become an American citizen and a practicing physician in this country, has won a patent for a tiny connector that he hopes will eliminate the need for the delicate end-to-end stitching together of blood vessels. His invention, two rings the size of a baby's finger, are cuffed to the severed ends of medium or large blood vessels, then connected.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dakov has put together a thick black binder detailing his research and the marketing and clinical trial plans for his invention. The patent has been assigned to Motorola, and Dr. Dakov has written to dozens of university and hospital medical researchers about his idea. Many have written back with careful praise and an interest in helping with his clinical trials.</p>
        <p>Like most independent inventors, Dr. Dakov now faces the struggle of introducing an invention that he believes will revolutionize his field. He expects that his device, though unproved, will eliminate the mistakes or complications that can result from manually sewing together blood vessels, a procedure known as an anastomosis.</p>
        <p>At the end of the 20th century, most surgical anastomoses were performed the same way as they were 100 years earlier, by manual suturing, Dr. Dakov wrote in his patent material. He faults those procedures because surgeons must judge the tautness of the sutures, an acquired skill that not everyone can master and because stitching can be time consuming, cutting off blood flow for too long -- perhaps long enough to kill surrounding tissue.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dakov's connector is made of a rigid ring with tiny, thin wire teeth around its inner edge. The wires are attached to the edge at the top end only. The end of the ring without the wires is fitted over the end of a blood vessel. The severed end of the vessel slides under the row of wires, which are then bent over and pressed down to hold the vessel in place. Once the rings are attached to each end of the cut vessel, the rings are connected with tiny, interlocking arms.</p>
        <p>The two coupled rings totally encompass and support the vessel ends on the outside, Dr. Dakov writes. He believes the quick joining of the vessel and the tight seal between the rings will prevent leaks, ruptures and infections.</p>
        <p>The same design can be used for side-to-end blood vessel connections, where a vessel is joined to a perpendicular vessel. The connectors can be made of metal or plastic, and are designed to be permanent. Dr. Dakov, who lives in New York City, received patent 6,030,392.</p>
        <p>Helmet May Prevent Surgical Mishaps</p>
        <p>Head or eye injuries are not often considered potential complications of surgery, but William Mazzei believes that a prone and unconscious patient is at risk during an operation. So he's patented a helmet that people can wear to protect them throughout surgery. It also has a mask to guard the face.</p>
        <p>In his patent application, Mr. Mazzei, who lives in San Diego, points out that anesthetized people cannot move their heads or avert their eyes in reaction to pressure or pain. Operating room doctors and nurses must be particularly careful when patients are placed on their stomachs throughout surgery. The weight of the patient's own head can be enough to cause compression injuries to the eyes, chin or forehead, or cut off blood flow to surrounding tissue.</p>
        <p>In addition, patients often have to be turned on the operating table or rolled onto a cart. An anesthetized person is dead weight, and rolling them can injure the neck, Mr. Mazzei warns.</p>
        <p>He invented a helmet comprising interchangeable casings and cushioned inserts that can be sized and shaped to different heads. It has chin supports that also come in different dimensions. And a face plate creates a cushioned mask to cover the entire face.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mazzei says his modular design allows ''prefitting of the patient while the patient is awake and alert,'' and that the padded inserts distribute pressure over the head and face so the surgical team does not have to arrange pillows around the patient's head. A hinge on the lower face and chin portion of the helmet allows it to open so that tubes can be inserted into the patient's mouth or nose. Mr. Mazzei received patent 6,112,333.</p>
        <p>A Safer Scalpel For Caesarean Births</p>
        <p>About a quarter of all births in the United States are by Caesarean section, a surgery involving cutting through a woman's abdomen and into her uterus to deliver a baby. Making an incision through the skin, fat cells and muscle of the abdomen requires a sharp scalpel. But such a knife might nick a baby while slicing into the uterus. So doctors often make a small incision in the uterus and then enlarge the cut with special scissors or even a finger.</p>
        <p>Andrew Menzin and Myles Kobren think their newly patented Caesarean scalpel might be more effective in preventing injuries to babies. They have invented a scalpel blade with a blunt, rounded edge that they say will not cut but can still separate the muscle fibers of the uterus. A small, shallow incision is first made in the uterus wall with a traditional scalpel. Then the doctor switches to the blunt scalpel and uses it to divide the uterus wall down to the amniotic cavity where the baby waits.</p>
        <p>''Even if a part of the baby's body is pressed against the inner wall of the uterus at the point of incision, so that the blunt-edge device touches the baby, the baby will not be lacerated,'' write Mr. Menzin, from Roslyn Heights, N.Y., and Mr. Kobren, from Plainview, N.Y., in their patent application. They received patent 6,102,924.</p>
