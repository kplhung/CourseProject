        <p>Desire and self-control battled it out in the songs Christina Aguilera performed at the Jones Beach Theater on Friday night. ''Hormones racing at the speed of light,'' she sang in ''Genie in a Bottle,'' her opening song, ''but that don't mean it's gotta be tonight.'' She strutted across the stage, promising love and pumping her hips, giving lessons in sexual brinkmanship to her audience of squealing young girls.</p>
        <p>''Genie in a Bottle'' is by far Ms. Aguilera's best song, with a slinky hint of Latin rhythm to animate its precise balance between come-hither and back-off. The rest of her repertory is nine-tenths Mariah Carey and one-tenth Madonna, with pop-gospel hymns, gushy ballads and trim dance tunes.</p>
        <p>When she's not telling a beau, ''Don't make me love you till I'm ready,'' or nervously admitting that she feels sexy ''When You Put Your Hands on Me,'' she's praising a boyfriend for staying with her through her ups and downs and declaring that she's his ''for all seasons.'' Ms. Aguilera, 19, and her songwriters and handlers deliberately steer clear of the wilderness between puppy love and happily ever after.</p>
        <p>There's little individual personality in the songs, but Ms. Aguilera delivers them like a trouper. She packs a big, sultry voice into her small, skinny, girlish frame.</p>
        <p>Ms. Aguilera's vocal technique separates her decisively from Britney Spears, another former member of the new ''Mickey Mouse Club Show'' in the early 1990's. When Ms. Spears played the Jones Beach Theater in June, she had elaborate sets and effects to compensate for her skimpy voice. Ms. Aguilera led four other dancers and had a few costume changes: variations on halter tops and tight lace-up pants. But her performance was about singing, and she didn't need a lot of special effects.</p>
        <p>Songs made plenty of room for Ms. Aguilera's elaborate oohs and ahs, turning into into showcases for vocal curlicues of escalating urgency and elaborateness. Her speaking voice was hoarse, the result of a long night after the MTV Video Music Awards on Thursday, she said. But the hint of strain made her singing sound a little more heartfelt and human.</p>
        <p>Only in her version of the Etta James torch song ''At Last'' did Ms. Aguilera go overboard, with so many vocal embellishments that the song lost its shape. Her other wild-card song was Free's ''All Right Now''; leaving its pronouns intact, Ms. Aguilera whooped and wailed about taking a woman back to her place. But for the most part she played the nice girl whose voice tells more than she says she knows.</p>
        <p>Destiny's Child, which shared the bill, is a teenage female trio -- down from its four-member recording lineup -- that applies its harmonies to more down-to-earth takes on romance. Beyonce Knowles, the group's lead singer, shares the songwriting in the group's best songs, which are staccato, syncopated tales of a sponger (''Bills, Bills, Bills''), a stalker (''Bug A Boo''), a cheater (''Say My Name'') and a detractor (''So Good'').</p>
        <p>Destiny's Child had abundant visual and vocal presence, as its members pulled off intricate harmonies in time with synchronized dance moves. In an unaccompanied gospel segment, all three women demonstrated gutsy voices, yet the uptempo songs seemed to add prerecorded backup vocals behind Ms. Knowles's creamy leads. And like many hip-hop-tinged groups, Destiny's Child spent too much time stoking audience participation, especially in songs that didn't need any distractions.</p>
