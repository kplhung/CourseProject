        <p>Despite its Texas-size sense of its own primacy in almost everything, New York City in recent years has not been the site of the country's bloodiest newspaper war. That title went to Denver, where rival papers tried to starve each other into submission by offering themselves for a penny a day.</p>
        <p>Penny, schmenny. Tomorrow, New York gets a new afternoon newspaper for nothing, courtesy of The Daily News. (The News itself still costs 50 cents.) After The News announced its plans for the free Daily News Express, The New York Post quickly cut its newsstand price to 25 cents from 50 cents within the city limits. If red ink trickled through the streets of Denver, it threatens to course through the streets of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>What does it mean? Everyone in the business has his own take. But most agree that the sudden escalation of New York's long-running tabloid war makes the perennially uncertain newspaper landscape even more uncertain. A new weapon, the free daily afternoon newspaper, hurts The Post. The Post, however, has shown that it knows how to undercut The News. Four years ago, it introduced a cut-rate Sunday newspaper, forcing The News to cut its newsstand price; even so, in less than a year, circulation of The News's most valuable edition dropped more than 100,000 copies.</p>
        <p>Leonard N. Stern, who, as the owner of The Village Voice, turned the paid alternative weekly into a free newspaper and then sold it at a significant profit, sees the latest developments in stark terms. ''The Daily News is the dominant tabloid of the city, and it is now under challenge for its life,'' he said. Mr. Stern, chairman of the privately held Hartz Group, added: ''This is it. I believe the battle has been joined. When it's over, things are not going to look the way they do today.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern's views are stark, but he is not alone. Even more moderate observers do not disagree about the intensity of the current battle, or the willingness of the combatants to incur short-  or medium-term losses in pursuit of long-term dominance. John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst, observed, ''When you have two papers, neither of which is making money, going at it in this fashion, what it promises to do is increase the losses for both of them.'' He added that Rupert Murdoch, chairman of The Post's parent, the News Corporation, and Mortimer B. Zuckerman, co-owner of The News, have each  demonstrated a determination to keep control of a New York newspaper. ''It's not about money,'' he said. ''It's about image and being the publisher of a major newspaper in the world's most important city.''</p>
        <p>So The News and The Post are willingly incurring extra economic pain at a time when there is already pain enough: the price of newsprint, the biggest nonlabor cost for any newspaper, is rising steeply in a market tighter than at any time in the last four years.</p>
        <p>For The News, there is also the question of fighting a two-front war: Newsday, the Long Island newspaper, is beginning a circulation comeback in Queens after years of decline; its editor, Anthony Marro, said he planned to send in 15 people next year to strengthen a Queens-based editorial staff that now numbers about 45. (Newsday is now owned by the Tribune Company, the former owner of The Daily News.)</p>
        <p>Indeed, to hear News executives tell it, you would not know that there was anything but fun and profit ahead. Their blithe willingness to flout received wisdom (newspapers that cost nothing are worth nothing to advertisers) has provoked guarded enthusiasm from both media analysts and advertisers. About 75,000 copies of Express will be distributed at 85 commuter hubs: bridges, tunnels, bus terminals and subway and train stations. It can carry news that breaks as late as noon, executives say.</p>
        <p>Robert J. Broadwater, managing director of the media-centric investment bank Veronis, Suhler &amp; Associates, is impressed. ''I don't know if it will work for The News or anybody, but it's intriguing as all get-out,'' he said. ''In the current market for news and information and entertainment, it's increasingly difficult to get and hold a paying subscriber or reader. Circulation is the biggest challenge.''</p>
        <p>Esther Eaton, advertising director at Seaman Furniture, one of The News's major advertisers, called Express ''a great vehicle,'' adding, ''There's difference between a penny-saver type vehicle and a real newspaper.''</p>
        <p>Les Goodstein, chief operating officer of The News, said executives at The News conceived the idea when they heard that Metro, a Swedish-owned free newspaper, would be distributed to Philadelphia commuters in cooperation with the city's transit authority. ''We are taking the concept and refining it to fit the needs of the New York area,'' he said. And maybe trying to discourage the executives of Metro's parent company, the Modern Times Group, from thinking about a move to New York. Earlier this year, Modern Times executives discussed a possible collaboration with The Post, but those talks were not productive, according to an executive involved in the talks.</p>
        <p>Express, as designed, will split its 40 pages roughly equally between advertising and editorial material: pictures, listings and short, 300-word articles, emphasizing topics like business, entertainment and sports. In Europe, such free dailies began to win audiences more than two decades ago. But almost all were morning publications -- and New Yorkers can choose from The Post, The News, The New York Times and Newsday in the morning.</p>
        <p>''The gaping hole,'' Mr. Goodstein said, ''was in the afternoon.''</p>
        <p>The high-profile introduction is generating guarded excitement among advertisers, who have been less than enthusiastic about reader erosion. The News -- which a decade ago had a circulation of more than a million -- is struggling to keep its circulation figure above 700,000 for the six-month period ending Sept. 30.</p>
        <p>In fact, erosion of New York City circulation has affected not just The News but The New York Times as well. The Post has bucked this trend the last few years but has lost some of its core Manhattan readership. Others who remain loyal to The Post have known it since it was an afternoon newspaper itself -- and save it for the train or bus ride home. Tomorrow, these readers of The Post will be offered a free copy of Express by a novel crew of hawkers, including an actress, an opera singer and a handful of leggy cheerleaders.</p>
        <p>If The News wants to grab The Post's readers, it would not mind slicing into Newsday's advertising revenue. Last year, Newsday's Queens circulation increased after three years of losses, while the Queens circulation of The News dipped. Retailers like Seaman Furniture, which advertise in both, have limited budgets. Eventually, Ms. Eaton said, new expenditures for ads in Express would require her to cut spending elsewhere. Perhaps at Newsday. Or, perhaps, at The News.</p>
        <p>Cannibalization of readers and advertising dollars, is a consideration for executives of The News. But Mr. Goodstein said he was not worried. Express, he said, posed little threat to The News. ''If we compare them, the morning paper is the novel, the evening paper is the Cliffs Notes.'' Edward Kosner, editor in chief of The Daily News, said Express has a staff of 20, about half carved out of The News staff and many of the rest hired, for the moment, on a contingency basis.</p>
        <p>''The New York market is going to stay competitive,'' Mr. Goodstein said. ''The way we're positioning our product is as an all-day news product.'' Much of its breaking business news will come from the San Francisco-based Web site CBSMarketwatch.com.</p>
        <p>But can The Daily News's daily circulation (730,542 for the six months ended March 31) withstand the possible hammer effect of The Post's price cut? With a circulation measured at 436,544 for the period ended March 31, The Post looses less from such an action than The News does if it follows suit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch, for his part, is legendary for using blunt instruments like price cuts to good effect in one market after another. In London, a 1993 price cut at The Times of London brought in close to 400,000 new readers, more than half of whom stayed even when the price went back up. Its rival, The Daily Telegraph, was forced to cut its own prices in response.</p>
        <p>In Britain, cuts in the cover price are a more dire move, since 35 percent to 50 percent of most British newspapers' revenue come from readers. By contrast, most American newspapers gain close to 80 percent of their revenue from advertisers. Still, analysts believe The Post already loses at least $10 million annually; the new price cut should add millions more to the loss column.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Stern sees it, Mr. Murdoch's willingness to sustain that kind of drain makes him a fearsome competitor. ''I've been in many businesses, including publishing. I can tell you categorically: I don't want to be in any business where I have to compete with Rupert Murdoch.''</p>
        <p>Ken Chandler, publisher of The Post, alluded to the News Corporation's willingness to endure economic pain when he said, ''I remind people that we have a history of being patient and taking a long-term view with newspapers.'' He added, ''Basically, we just see this price change as a chance to introduce new readers to the paper and reintroduce old readers who may not have looked at us recently,'' pointing out that the paper has increased its daily circulation by 50,000 in the last five years.</p>
        <p>Keeping that upward momentum is important, particularly when $200 million worth of new presses are nearing completion. Some observers suggest it may also be important for The Post to impress federal regulators with its willingness to publish at great cost to itself -- so they will not  overrule the News Corporation's recently announced plans to buy a second television station in New York as an unacceptable concentration of media power.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Chandler is willing to do some genteel trash-talking about his rivals at The News. ''Our hawkers will go toe to toe with theirs,'' he said. ''And we have got a few things that we're keeping close to our chest that will make life more interesting.'' He does not rule out the possibility that his morning paper will publish a few evening special editions of its own. Major events at the Summer Olympics in Sydney are scheduled for the early-morning hours, East Coast time -- perfect timing for a noon deadline.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it is no accident that Express is starting just as the Summer Olympics are about to begin and the pre-Christmas advertising begins to roll in. But then what? Ms. Eaton of Seaman said she was originally asked to commit to 16 weeks of advertising (she committed to 8). Mr. Goodstein said Express's viability -- meaning its appeal to advertisers -- would be continually monitored; it is clear that it could be abandoned quickly if its usefulness seemed doubtful.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, executives at The Post will be monitoring their own circulation; Mr. Chandler does not rule out further price cuts, ignoring Mr. Goodstein's provocative description of The Post's move as a ''desperation'' strategy.</p>
        <p>''Obviously this is a very, very competitive environment,'' Mr. Chandler said. ''We are wholly focused on The Post and we see The Post as a long-term investment.''</p>
