        <p>FOR SOME reason, patriotism didn't motivate some of the top men to rearrange their schedules and accommodate a trip to Sydney.</p>
        <p>An uninspired Pete Sampras, for one, decided to turn down the opportunity to win a gold medal, something most athletes dream about. If Sampras had been watching in Atlanta, he would have seen a very moved Andre Agassi (who recently withdrew from the Sydney Games to be with his ailing mother and sister) treat the gold medal as something every bit as precious as a Grand Slam title.</p>

        <p>FOR SOME reason, patriotism didn't motivate some of the top men to rearrange their schedules and accommodate a trip to Sydney.</p>
        <p>An uninspired Pete Sampras, for one, decided to turn down the opportunity to win a gold medal, something most athletes dream about. If Sampras had been watching in Atlanta, he would have seen a very moved Andre Agassi (who recently withdrew from the Sydney Games to be with his ailing mother and sister) treat the gold medal as something every bit as precious as a Grand Slam title.</p>
        <p>The top American women are capable of sweeping the medals with Lindsay Davenport, Venus Williams and Monica Seles on singles and Serena Williams joining the team for doubles.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- There is a 64-player draw, with 32 pairs in doubles. On July 10, the top 48 players in the world automatically qualified for the Olympics, but no country may enter more than three singles players and one doubles team per men's and women's teams. The single-elimination tournament will take place on a hardcourt surface.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- All matches are two of three sets except for the men's singles and doubles finals, which are three-of-five-set matches. The winners of the semifinals will determine the gold and silver medals, while the losers of the semis will play for the bronze.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- The American men will have to decide who will play doubles with the acerbic Jeff Tarango, and the women will have to guard against overconfidence. The doubles team of Venus and Serena Williams, which went on a 28-0 streak after the 1999 French Open, looks dominating even though Serena pulled out of the United States Open doubles because of a foot injury.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- The Americans will face a very tough Australian team. Playing in front of the vocal Aussies, Lleyton Hewitt, Patrick Rafter and Mark Philippoussis will have the home-court advantage. Carlos Moya of Spain, Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, Tim Henman of Britain and Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands could also make some noise. Davenport is also a defending gold medal winner but may have to get by one of her teammates to return to the podium.</p>
