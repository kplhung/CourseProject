        <p>IN an uncertain advertising world, one truth remains: the days just after Labor Day are unusually hectic as Madison Avenue gears up for the busy fall season. That was certainly the case last week, as assignments with billings estimated at more than $250 million changed hands.</p>
        <p>Divisions of the B Com3 Group in Chicago figured in two of the shifts, which both came after reviews. One was for accounts awarded by the United States Postal Service in Washington, with total billings estimated at $139 million to $150 million, and the other was for tasks for Showtime Networks in New York, a cable television arm of media giant Viacom, with billings estimated at $35 million to $40 million.</p>

        <p>IN an uncertain advertising world, one truth remains: the days just after Labor Day are unusually hectic as Madison Avenue gears up for the busy fall season. That was certainly the case last week, as assignments with billings estimated at more than $250 million changed hands.</p>
        <p>Divisions of the B Com3 Group in Chicago figured in two of the shifts, which both came after reviews. One was for accounts awarded by the United States Postal Service in Washington, with total billings estimated at $139 million to $150 million, and the other was for tasks for Showtime Networks in New York, a cable television arm of media giant Viacom, with billings estimated at $35 million to $40 million.</p>
        <p>The Postal Service review, which was mandated, began in February and ended with a reshuffling of assignments. Telephone calls on Friday to Postal Service executives seeking details of the changes were not returned; agency executives who had been briefed on a pending announcement shared the information they had learned.</p>
        <p>The part of the account to create mass-market campaigns aimed at consumers is being awarded to the Leo Burnett USA unit of B Com3 , an agency new to the Postal Service's  roster. Burnett's gain comes two months after the agency, which had not previously sought many federal advertising assignments, landed the United States Army account. That account's billings are estimated at $110 million.</p>
        <p>The mass-market Postal Service duties had been handled by the New York office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications, which created campaigns carrying themes that included ''Fly like an eagle.''</p>
        <p>Its sibling, FCBi, will now be responsible for tasks like interactive and direct marketing and sales support. Those duties had been at Draft Worldwide in Chicago, which is part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>Media buying duties, which had been handled by Media Edge in New York, a unit of Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., are being shifted to MediaCom in New York, a division of the Grey Global Group. And Frankel in Chicago, part of the Publicis Groupe S.A., keeps its assignments in the realm of retail marketing.</p>
        <p>Showtime Networks, which oversees the Showtime, Movie Channel, Flix and Sundance Channel pay cable networks, hired two units of B Com3 : Burnett, for advertising, and Starcom USA, for media. The media duties had been handled by Media Edge and the ad duties, which included offering strategy and advice on positioning the networks among TV viewers, had been at a sibling, Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising.</p>
        <p>In assuming the ad duties, Burnett will work with the Red Group, the in-house unit of Showtime Networks that creates campaigns; that agency is supervised by Len Fogge, executive vice president for creative and marketing at Showtime Networks.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a three-month review that had been narrowed to the Burnett-Starcom team, the Y.&amp; R. Advertising-Media Edge team and these other finalists: the Bozell Group and TN Media in New York, both owned by True North Communications; DDB Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group; GSD&amp; M in Austin, Tex., also part of Omnicom; and a team of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in New York, which is being acquired by Publicis, and Zenith Media, owned by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and the Cordiant Communications Group.</p>
        <p>Turning to another decision, Unilever United States named two units of the WPP Group to serve as agency of record for planning and buying in the interactive media. Billings were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>The units of WPP selected by Unilever, which sells brands ranging from Dove soap to Pond's skin care products to Wisk detergent, are both based in New York: Digital@JWT, part of J. Walter Thompson, and OgilvyOne, part of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide. Thompson and Ogilvy are both longtime Unilever agencies.</p>
        <p>Brad Simmons, vice president for media services at Unilever United States in New York, said the decision came after a review that had been narrowed to the two WPP agencies and two other interactive shops: Lowe Lintas Interactive in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic, and Zentropy Partners, an Interpublic affiliate.</p>
        <p>Digital@JWT and OgilvyOne will handle planning and buying tasks associated with Unilever's interactive partnerships with companies like America Online, iVillage and MSN, as well as other planning and buying duties.</p>
        <p>In other reviews, the Credit Suisse Group in Zurich named StrawberryFrog in Amsterdam as the lead agency to handle its global strategic and creative brand advertising. Billings were estimated at $25 million.</p>
        <p>The two-month review had been narrowed to StrawberryFrog and two other finalists: Art and Ideas in Zurich, the incumbent; and Fallon London, part of the Fallon Worldwide unit of Publicis.</p>
        <p>Food Lion in Salisbury, N.C., part of Delhaize America, named Ames Scullin O'Haire Advertising in Atlanta as agency of record to handle creative brand work for the supermarket chain as well as media planning and buying. Spending was estimated at more than $19 million.</p>
        <p>The Atlanta office of Ogilvy previously handled the Food Lion account. Ames Scullin has worked for Kash n' Karry Food Stores, a Food Lion sibling, since 1997.</p>
        <p>And Neuberger Berman, the investment advisory company, named Hampel/Stefanides in New York, part of the Envoy Communications Group, to handle its account, which had been at Kirshenbaum Bond &amp; Partners in New York for about six years. Billings were estimated at $8 million to $10 million.</p>
        <p>Andrea Trachtenberg, senior vice president for marketing at Neuberger Berman, said the decision came after a three-  to four-month review that had been narrowed to Hampel/Stefanides and three other finalists, also in New York: Avrett Free &amp; Ginsberg, part of Bozell; Brouillard Communications, part of WPP; and Warwick Baker O'Neill, part of EPB Communications.</p>
