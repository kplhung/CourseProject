        <p>It was a half-hour after match point, near the front row inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, when a group of smitten fans and nudging camera operators were circling Marat Safin as if they were surrounding a campfire.</p>
        <p>In paparazzi style, the voices behind the lenses kept urging, ''This way, Marat, look here.'' The affable Russian smiled on cue.

        <p>It was a half-hour after match point, near the front row inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, when a group of smitten fans and nudging camera operators were circling Marat Safin as if they were surrounding a campfire.</p>
        <p>In paparazzi style, the voices behind the lenses kept urging, ''This way, Marat, look here.'' The affable Russian smiled on cue. With the frantic screams usually reserved for rock stars, a group of teenagers yelled, ''We love you, Marat.'' And the 20-year-old with pinup good looks grinned.</p>
        <p>Just a few minutes earlier last night, in a corridor near the men's locker room, Pete Sampras emerged from behind a door and asked a nearby official, ''Where is she?'' An instant later, the 29-year-old Sampras peeked down a hallway and found her. He embraced his fiancee, the actress Bridgette Wilson, and said something that made both of them laugh.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the Grand Slam legend seemed O.K. with what had unfolded. He knew it would happen eventually. One day, a young player would come along to create the same kind of frenzy he did a decade ago at the United States Open. As afternoon turned into a cool evening, it happened.</p>
        <p>A helpless Sampras stood across the net and witnessed the unveiling of the sport's hot new act. With the reflexes to gobble up Sampras's 125-mile-an-hour serves, with the calm to endure the pressure of his first Grand Slam final, with the wrist snap of a lion tamer on his passing shots, Safin played a nearly flawless match against one of the greatest players ever. After a stunningly easy 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 victory, Safin was the one holding the championship trophy while Sampras stood in the background with the second-place platter.</p>
        <p>''It reminded me of when I was 19 years old and steamrolled over Andre Agassi,'' said Sampras, who now has a 13-3 record in Grand Slam finals and had never lost a final in straight sets. ''I was steamrolled today by him. The only time he showed any nerves was in the last game of the match.''</p>
        <p>At that moment, the adrenaline surfing inside Safin's 6-foot-4-inch frame morphed into fear. Serving for the match, Safin began with a timid double fault. Wanting to test Safin's nerve, Sampras stopped charging to the net and started to rally from the baseline. Soon, for the first time all match, Sampras had a break point.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know what to do,'' Safin said. ''I was under pressure. I couldn't play. I couldn't hit a second serve. I didn't know what would happen if I lose this game. I didn't want to think about it. I was so nervous. I thought, 'It's now, or it's never, never going to be.' ''</p>
        <p>With his friends on edge in the players' box, Safin uncorked a swinging forehand volley for a winner. But there was no relief, yet. After Safin charged forward on a short ball, he tightened up and sent a backhand into the net. Sampras now had his second break point.</p>
        <p>But Sampras's strategy of rallying caught up with him. From behind the baseline, Sampras flailed at a forehand and smacked it wide. On his first match point, Safin's eyes grew as large as bottle caps when he saw Sampras scoot toward the net. With one unflappable motion, Safin fired a backhand, cross-court passing shot for a winner.</p>
        <p>In his thrilled, delirious state, Safin shook Sampras's hand, wandered aimlessly around the net post, then knelt down and kissed the court. Minutes later, a check for $800,000 was in his pocket and the trophy was cradled in his arms. And the question asked of him in front of more than 20,000 fans was this: How did you return Sampras's serve?</p>
        <p>''You think I know?'' said a smiling Safin, igniting a group chuckle from the crowd. ''I don't know.''</p>
        <p>Just how did this happen? In April, Safin was known as a temperamental player who cracked more rackets than forehand winners. He had a reputation for tanking matches, was in the throes of a 5-11 start and contemplated quitting. But then Andrei Chesnokov, his coach at the time, also became his faith healer. Once Safin began to understand what it meant to fight through a tough match, once he put his mind into every point, his year turned around.</p>
        <p>Now, he has a 52-21 record, has climbed to No. 2 in the ranking, and is threatening to take over the men's tennis scene. Yesterday, he routinely crushed his 12 aces at 120-plus miles an hour, sent back returns of serve that rocketed near Sampras's feet at the net and committed an amazingly low 12 unforced errors. In comparison, Sampras had 8 aces, committed 25 unforced errors and won only 43 of 82 points at the net.</p>
        <p>''It hasn't happened to me that often that I've gotten kind of carved wax like that,'' Sampras said. ''I didn't really expect him to do that. I knew he was going to play well, but I didn't think he was going to play that well that long. I figured he would get nervous.''</p>
        <p>Safin was calm from the moment he walked into the stadium. In the seventh game of the first set, he fielded a 125-mile-an-hour service blast and, with barely a backswing at all, snapped a forehand passing shot down the line for a winner on break point.</p>
        <p>Sampras stood still, stunned at Safin's response to his first serve. As the match unfolded, Sampras's disbelief became routine. But after 13 Grand Slam titles, after maturing into a 29-year-old with a wedding on the horizon, Sampras accepted his defeat graciously.</p>
        <p>''It will be a little bit more different for him,'' Sampras said. ''But the way Marat is playing, he's the future of the game. I think he's a good credit to the game because he's a nice guy and will represent the sport of tennis very well.</p>
        <p>''He could be No. 1 if he wants to do it. It's a decision you have to make about your life. You have to decide how much you want to be at the top of the game and deal with the pressures.''</p>
        <p>As the sun began to set on his day, Safin was getting a taste of the attention that has been on Sampras for the last decade. Inside a mob leaning to get close to him after the match, he was learning a little about the crush of fame. He didn't seem to mind at all.</p>
        <p>''Tell me and explain to me why I have to change? Because of this?'' said Safin, who pointed to the trophy. ''I just win a huge tournament, I get this. Yes, I have a check of $800,000. But that's it.''</p>
        <p>There could be more checks, trophies and days like this for the young Safin. Unless the turnaround he made this year is only temporary, unless his penchant for late nights and a few drinks begins to interfere with his success, Safin could be in the limelight for a long time to come.</p>
        <p>''There is different level to how much you want,'' he said. ''For me, it's one level. If I have this opportunity, I will do this. If I can stay for one year, I will make it. If I have a chance to make it 7 years or for 10 years, I will make it also. Everyone has the opportunity to be on top. If you want it, you can be there. I want it. I personally want it.''</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>The second-seeded doubles team of JULIE HALARD-DECUGIS and AI SUGIYAMA defeated 10th-seeded CARA BLACK and YELENA LIKHOVTSEVA, 6-0, 1-6, 6-1, to take the women's doubles title. . . . The up-and-coming American ANDY RODDICK defeated another American, ROBBY GINEPRI, 6-1, 6-3, to win the junior boys' singles title.</p>
