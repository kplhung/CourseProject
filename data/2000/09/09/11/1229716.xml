        <p>ONCE A BODY OF water controlled by high-flying Americans, the Olympic diving tank has belonged to the Chinese since Greg Louganis made the perfect exit in 1988 after so many perfect entries. Since then, the only American to win a gold medal has been Mark Lenzi, in 1992 on the springboard. In 1996, the Americans could muster only two bronze medals; Sydney should not change their or the Chinese's luck.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- After 80 years of continuity, in which men and women competed individually on 3-meter springboard and 10-meter platform, the sport added four events in the 2000 Games. All four are synchronized events, in which two teammates attempt to perform identical dives simultaneously. In springboard, they dive off  side-by-side boards. In platform, they dive off the same platform. The result is quite telegenic, which helps explain why ''synchro'' is getting its Olympic moment.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- As in 1996, 18 divers will advance to the semifinals in the individual events. After five compulsory dives, 12 competitors will then advance to the finals, where they will perform six dives of their choice. The semifinal and final dives are then added together to produce a diver's total score. There are seven judges, who award scores of up to 10 points for each dive. Their scores are then multiplied by a coefficient determined by the dive's degree of difficulty, which range from the lowly 1.3 to the presumably life-threatening 3.6. In synchro, there are only eight teams in each event and no preliminaries.</p>

        <p>THE SCORING -- As in 1996, 18 divers will advance to the semifinals in the individual events.

Their scores are then multiplied by a coefficient determined by the dive's degree of difficulty, which range from the lowly 1.3 to the presumably life-threatening 3.6. In synchro, there are only eight teams in each event and no preliminaries.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- There are five categories in springboard: inward, forward, backward, reverse and twisting. In platform diving, there is an additional category: the armstand. The key to success is being able to juggle risk and perfection. A dive with a high degree of difficulty with minor faults will outscore a simpler dive performed flawlessly.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- After retiring for the second time, China's Fu Mingxia, the most successful diver of the 1990's, will attempt to become the first diver to win five gold medals. Fu won her first gold medal in 1992 on platform at age 14 and then swept both women's events in 1996. She will compete only on springboard in Sydney, and she is a favorite in the synchronized event with Guo Jingjing. The Chinese teenager Li Na is a rising (make that falling) star in the women's platform, and her countryman Tian Ling will duel with the defending Olympic champion, Dmitri Sautin of Russia, on the men's platform. Sautin is also a favorite in springboard, along with the defending Olympic champion Xiong Ni of China. Americans to watch include Mark Ruiz on springboard and platform and Laura Wilkinson on women's platform.</p>
