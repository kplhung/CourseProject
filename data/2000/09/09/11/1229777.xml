        <p>If Bill Parcells still casts his enormous shadow over the Jets, then Bill Belichick is the coach who confounds the franchise's psyche. While the Tuna Bowl has lost some of its bile with the specious declaration of a truce in the border war between the Patriots and the Jets, the family feud that has its latest chapter tonight at Giants Stadium is compelling in large part because Belichick still generates such enormous veneration -- and a bit of foreboding -- in the Jets' locker room.</p>
        <p>The Jets seemed as confused about what they should expect tonight as opposing offenses used to be when Belichick was the Jets' defensive guru. Marcus Coleman spoke admiringly of the ''bag of tricks'' Belichick used to lug around when devising game plans, but nobody seemed sure how deep Belichick -- in his first appearance against the Jets as the Patriots' head coach -- would dig to devise a plan to stop the Jets' offense. Or would Belichick, cognizant that Jets Coach Al Groh maintains a deep knowledge of the Patriots' abilities from his own days with the Patriots, stick to the basics and let the two teams slug it out, with the result riding on execution.</p>

        <p>If Bill Parcells still casts his enormous shadow over the Jets, then Bill Belichick is the coach who confounds the franchise's psyche. While the Tuna Bowl has lost some of its bile with the specious declaration of a truce in the border war between the Patriots and the Jets, the family feud that has its latest chapter tonight at Giants Stadium is compelling in large part because Belichick still generates such enormous veneration -- and a bit of foreboding -- in the Jets' locker room.</p>
        <p>The Jets seemed as confused about what they should expect tonight as opposing offenses used to be when Belichick was the Jets' defensive guru. Marcus Coleman spoke admiringly of the ''bag of tricks'' Belichick used to lug around when devising game plans, but nobody seemed sure how deep Belichick -- in his first appearance against the Jets as the Patriots' head coach -- would dig to devise a plan to stop the Jets' offense. Or would Belichick, cognizant that Jets Coach Al Groh maintains a deep knowledge of the Patriots' abilities from his own days with the Patriots, stick to the basics and let the two teams slug it out, with the result riding on execution.</p>
        <p>''We have to go out and do the things we do well, knowing he knows this team very well,'' Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde said. ''But he's not going to do anything outrageous because they don't want to get caught in things they're not used to running.''</p>
        <p>Linebacker Dwayne Gordon is not so sure.</p>
        <p>''There's going to be a lot of tinkering,'' Gordon said. ''Both these coaching staffs have had a history of showing some brand new schemes on one week of preparation. You have to come into the game with the attitude that anything is going to happen. It will be safe to say that whoever adjusts the quickest is probably going to be on top.''</p>
        <p>Belichick may not have to get too exotic to unravel the Jets' offense, because the medical report may do more damage than any scheme. The Jets gave no update yesterday on receiver Wayne Chrebet, who strained his lower leg toward the end of Saturday's practice. Chrebet's availability will be a game-time decision, the team spokesman Frank Ramos said. If Chrebet cannot play -- or if he is limited -- the Jets will have to rely on Vincent Brisby, whom the Patriots cut during training camp only to have him take the Foxboro-Hempstead shuttle to the Jets.</p>
        <p>Running back Curtis Martin, who was in on 36 offensive plays and scored both of the Jets' touchdowns in last week's victory at Green Bay, will wear a brace on his strained left knee tonight. He practiced Friday and Saturday, but Martin's role could be scaled back, Groh said Saturday. That means the Jets' offensive coordinator, Dan Henning, probably spent yesterday doing as much tinkering with the game plan as Belichick is famous for.</p>
        <p>A few things are certain. In one of the interesting entanglements of this Montague-Capulet relationship, Belichick knows Testaverde nearly as well as he knows the Jets' defense; when he was the Browns' head coach, he infuriated Cleveland fans when he benched the local boy Bernie Kosar in favor of Testaverde.</p>
        <p>Belichick knows that Testaverde's game once suffered under duress, so he is sure to send his defense at Testaverde to try to force him into poor decisions -- particularly if he does not have Chrebet as his primary target. Testaverde said early last week that he would try to remember the defenses he faced in training camp last year in an effort to recall what Belichick would like to do to the Jets' offense.</p>
        <p>The Jets will try to abuse the Patriots' offensive line the way Tampa Bay did last week, when quarterback Drew Bledsoe was sacked a career-high six times and sent to the ground 31 times in 66 plays. Still, he completed 67 percent of his passes and was not intercepted, a performance Groh called magnificent. But the Jets' defense, when designed by Belichick under Parcells (before he moved from the sideline to the front office), baffled Bledsoe, who has thrown eight touchdowns and eight interceptions in five games against the Jets.</p>
        <p>The Jets and the Patriots may know so much about each other that they have assured their mutual destruction. Groh said that he and Belichick grew up in the same system and believe in the same concepts. But Groh tried to play down the extra insight the two coaches have.</p>
        <p>''We have a knowledge that division rivals build up on each other,'' Groh said. ''It just came faster in this game. It puts us back on the same basis. And that's as far as you should take it. If you try to think of every single thing that the other team has ever done, you run around chasing your tail.''</p>
