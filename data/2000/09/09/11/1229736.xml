        <p>Local television news programs rarely break news of national consequence. In fact, they are often accused of being superficial and  sensationalistic and of relying on ''scare tactic'' consumer reports whose promotional spots warn of dire consequences should viewers miss them.</p>
        <p>But it was just such a consumer report, shown on a local news program, that in large part resulted in Bridgestone/Firestone's recall of 6.5 million tires last month and the corresponding public relations crisis now engulfing it and Ford Motor.</p>
        <p>KHOU-TV Channel 11, the Houston CBS affiliate owned by A. H. Belo first reported in February that possibly defective Firestone tires on Ford Explorers may have caused a number of deaths across the country.</p>
        <p>Last week, members of Congress and officials of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that report and the other KHOU reports that followed it, had prompted the federal investigation that ultimately linked 88 deaths to possible deficiencies in the Firestone tires on Ford Explorers.</p>
        <p>Anna Werner, the correspondent on the report, said she had no idea the issue would balloon into front-page news when she first heard about it last fall from a lawyer she had called one day in search of news subjects.</p>
        <p>She said he told her he was working on a civil case involving accusations that a defective Firestone tire had caused a fatal accident. She said he referred her to a number of similar cases.</p>
        <p>''I was skeptical,'' Ms. Werner said in an interview last week. ''You hear a lot of things that sound like they could be vague or interesting stories. It was an interesting lead.''</p>
        <p>In all, she said she had discovered more than two dozen cases in which Ford Explorers with Firestone tires were being blamed for up to 30 accident deaths.</p>
        <p>The highway safety agency initially told her it had no significant information about trouble with Firestones on the Explorers.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Werner and her producer, David I. Raziq, said they had felt they had enough to go with the report. They did so on Feb. 7 at 10 p.m. It was watched in 164,000 households in the Houston area.</p>
        <p>Firestone was quoted in the segment as saying that it had full confidence in its tires. The segment quoted Ford blaming ''driver error'' for the accidents. After the first report, the Firestone response to the station grew tougher. On Feb. 10, it wrote KHOU management a letter that its executive news director, Michael T. Devlin, said he believed carried an unspoken threat of litigation.</p>
        <p>The letter said, ''This series has unmistakably delivered the false messages that Radial ATX tires are dangerous.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Devlin said the letter had given him pause. ''You have to take a breath and say 'Are we okay?' '' he said.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Devlin said, he was confident in his station's reporting. KHOU kept following it with reports throughout that week as it received calls from local Explorer drivers who said they had also experienced problems with their Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>Throughout its coverage, it directed people to the highway safety agency if they had experienced problems with Firestone tires on Explorers.</p>
        <p>In May, after receiving dozens of these complaints, the highway safety agency began a preliminary investigation. It was only then that other news media companies began carrying reports on the issue.</p>
        <p>Officials with the highway safety agency credited the KHOU report with focusing its attention on the potential problem and, ultimately, prompting its investigation, which is still under way.</p>
        <p>Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana who is chairman of the House Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and one of the leaders of the Congressional investigation into Ford and Firestone, referred to the journalists behind the report as heroes. He chided the highway safety agency for not noticing the trend in accidents on its own.</p>
        <p>''It took a television station's publicly embarrassing the agency to get the agency off the dime,'' Mr. Tauzin said in an interview last week.</p>
        <p>Even Ford credited the station with prompting its investigation into the tire problems, which helped lead to the recall.</p>
        <p>''They deserve a medal actually,'' said Jacques Nasser, the Ford chief executive. ''Channel 11 started everyone to think maybe there really was something there.''</p>
        <p>The station's success has led to some criticism, however. The highway safety agency's administrator, Dr. Sue Bailey, implied that the KHOU journalists ultimately slowed her agency's investigation by refusing to provide it with their initial reporting, as had been requested.</p>
        <p>Considering the possibility of litigation and citing the traditional separation between media and the government, station executives said they did not feel it was their duty to share their reporting.</p>
        <p>The members of the KHOU investigative team said the whole experience had left them somewhat bowled over.</p>
        <p>''This is totally beyond any of us,'' Ms. Werner said. ''What I hope it says to news directors and others around the country is focus on the journalism. Don't get hung up on ratings and the numbers, and you will achieve something beyond your imagination.''</p>
