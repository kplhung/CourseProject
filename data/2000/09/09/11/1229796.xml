        <p>When Al Leiter faces one of baseball's best pitchers, he knows his team will have few chances to score. So Leiter, the Mets' energetic left-hander, consciously tries to rein himself in and pay attention to everything. He knows there is no room for error.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Leiter matched up with the Philadelphia Phillies' Omar Daal, who could become the first pitcher in decades to lose 20 games in one year. But Leiter knew runs would be scarce. The Mets have had trouble hitting all pitchers lately, and Leiter used his no-nonsense approach.</p>
        <p>''My focus and concentration were the best they've been in a while,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nothing distracted Leiter in leading the Mets to a 3-0 victory. He was determined not only to focus but also to pitch nine innings, and Manager Bobby Valentine let him. It took 135 pitches -- the most by a Mets starter this year -- but Leiter earned his first shutout since he blanked Cincinnati in the one-game playoff last October.</p>
        <p>The victory, coupled with a loss by Atlanta, took the Mets within two and a half games of the Braves for first place in the National League East. In the wild-card race, the Mets (81-61) lead Arizona, which lost to Florida yesterday, by four and a half games.</p>
        <p>The Mets, who won for just the second time in nine games this month, continued to struggle offensively. ''You don't expect to go out and score 10 runs because you feel you're overdue,'' catcher Mike Piazza said. They managed only five hits in six innings off Daal (3-18) and scored their runs on a groundout, a hit-by-pitch and a sacrifice fly.</p>
        <p>But it was enough, and the Mets won the way they did when they were rolling just after the All-Star Game break. It is minimalist style -- a few runs, good pitching, fine defense -- but it is essential.</p>
        <p>''I think it's confidence building,'' Valentine said. ''Those are the games you have to win to be a good team. When it's 10-1, anybody can play that game. You've got to be able to play the game, have good at-bats when it counts, make the plays when they count, make the pitches when they count.''</p>
        <p>The Mets did that today, though the Phillies helped. Todd Zeile doubled in the fourth when the Phillies' right fielder, Brian Hunter, slipped in pursuit. Jay Payton followed with a bad-hop single, and Mike Bordick knocked in Zeile with a groundout.</p>
        <p>Daal allowed his second and final run in the sixth, when he walked the bases loaded and hit Bordick's back foot with a slider. In the seventh, the Mets scored off Wayne Gomes when Derek Bell doubled, advanced to third on a flyout and came in on a sacrifice fly by Piazza.</p>
        <p>Piazza, who is batting .185 this month, said he had not been swinging well. He has been trying too hard to pull the ball. But against Gomes he kept his hands inside the ball to hit the other way, which is his strength. Piazza fought off an inside pitch and flied to right for the sacrifice.</p>
        <p>''That's what you have to do,'' said Piazza, whose average is still robust at .334 but is the lowest it has been since mid-April. ''If it's not working, change it and do something different.''</p>
        <p>Leiter (15-7) has been a little tired, he said, but a minor injury two starts ago may have come at the right time.</p>
        <p>In a loss to Houston on Aug. 29, Leiter strained his backside, which affected him on his landing. Because he had to land slightly to the side, he was unable to stay on top of his pitches, which consequently did not break as sharply. He lost again last Monday in Cincinnati, feeling some discomfort again.</p>
        <p>But Leiter threw fewer than 200 pitches combined in those starts -- his first two-start stretch with so few pitches all year -- and yesterday, he was landing properly.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to jinx myself,'' he told the pitching coach Dave Wallace after warming up in the bullpen, ''but if there is a chance for me to finish the game, don't worry about pitch count.'' Wallace understood.</p>
        <p>Midway through the game, second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo approached Leiter and teased him. ''C'mon,'' Alfonzo said. ''Are you tired or something?'' Leiter laughed it off. He knows the danger of high pitch counts -- he sustained a serious shoulder injury soon after throwing 162 pitches in one game for the Yankees in 1989 -- but he felt especially strong.</p>
        <p>''One hundred thirty, 140, I didn't care,'' Leiter said. ''I wanted to finish the game.''</p>
        <p>The ninth inning started off badly. Scott Rolen checked his swing on a high fastball and dumped it to right; Leiter called it a ''get-out-of-the-way-for-my-life single.'' But the dangerous Pat Burrell flied to left, and Hunter beat a curveball into the ground for a game-ending double play.</p>
        <p>For one day, the Mets could forget their offensive misery. They still need to put up big innings, Bordick said, and they left eight more runners on base yesterday. But there have been no accusations lately, Piazza said. The players have been accountable.</p>
        <p>''By no means are we back to where we know we should be,'' Piazza said. ''But at least everyone in here has had the guts to look themselves in the mirror and realize it starts with themselves. That's a good team thing.</p>
        <p>''Will it help us down the line? I don't know. But I think there's a good bunch of professional guys in here that know that we're not pointing fingers or panicking. We still have to come out and play baseball -- play hard.''</p>
