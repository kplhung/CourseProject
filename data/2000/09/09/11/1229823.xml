        <p>Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft-drink company, has signed a two-year strategic partnership agreement with Replay TV in Mountain View, Calif., which sells a service and digital video recorder that allows consumers to pause, replay, rewind and fast-forward through live television programming.

        <p>''We think this technology will become a part of consumers' lives,'' said Chuck Fruit, vice president and director for media and marketing assets at Coca-Cola in Atlanta, ''so we've got some experimentation and learning to do.''</p>
        <p>With the agreement, to be announced today, Coca-Cola becomes the second marketer after the Universal Pictures unit of Seagram to work with Replay TV, which along with a competitor, TiVo, is stirring concerns among advertisers because their services enable viewers to more easily skip commercials.</p>
        <p>''We want to learn what kind of brand messages or involvement makes sense in this environment,'' Mr. Fruit said, adding that Coca-Cola would start with sponsorships and banner ads on Replay TV as well as developing cross-promotions.</p>
