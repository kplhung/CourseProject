        <p>The discussion between Steve Phillips and Bobby Valentine took place in Valentine's office. That much, Phillips and Valentine agreed upon. After that, the details got murkier. Just what the general manager might have told the manager concerning how the Mets need to win soon remained uncertain because each offered scant insight and claimed that sort of chat was normal.</p>
        <p>But nothing has been normal around the Mets this month. Nothing is normal when a team that looked as if it were pushing toward the World Series at the end of August cannot routinely push runners 360 feet around the bases. Nothing is normal about losing seven of eight games and causing those haunting questions about Septembers past to resurface like an army of yellow school buses.</p>

        <p>The discussion between Steve Phillips and Bobby Valentine took place in Valentine's office. That much, Phillips and Valentine agreed upon. After that, the details got murkier.

        <p>But nothing has been normal around the Mets this month. Nothing is normal when a team that looked as if it were pushing toward the World Series at the end of August cannot routinely push runners 360 feet around the bases. Nothing is normal about losing seven of eight games and causing those haunting questions about Septembers past to resurface like an army of yellow school buses.</p>
        <p>Even after Al Leiter pitched a tremendous game in guiding the punchy Mets to a 3-0 victory over the Phillies, the Mets felt more relieved than elated. It was the Mets' second victory this month and just the third time they have prevailed in their last 18 games in September. Time to exhale? Yes. Time to celebrate? No.</p>
        <p>''A win is a win at this point,'' Todd Zeile said. ''It's a chance to take a breath.''</p>
        <p>That is all the Mets should do. Take a breath and remember that they have already crept too close to letting a special season slip away from them. Leiter made yesterday acceptable for the Mets, who scored two runs on outs and another on three walks and a hit batter. Leiter had told the pitching coach, Dave Wallace, that he wanted ''the benefit of the doubt'' if he came close to a complete game. He got it, uncorking 135 pitches and securing a dominating five-hitter. ''I was really focused on doing my job,'' Leiter said. ''Do your part and do your share.''</p>
        <p>Robin Ventura took a megaphone before the game and imitated Jim Carrey's Fire Marshall Bill from the old ''In Living Color'' television show, trying to create a loose atmosphere and succeeding. Valentine was relaxed enough with a 1-0 edge in the bottom of the sixth that he reprised his fake mustache, baseball cap and sunglasses disguise from last season when he had been ejected from a game and returned to the dugout stairwell. Once again, he used eye-black stickers as the mustache and even added a goatee this time.</p>
        <p>''I was looking for levity, looking for a little smile,'' Valentine said. ''I got some smiles.''</p>
        <p>Zeile said that Valentine's disguise elicited ''a few rolled eyes and a couple of chuckles.'' But the gimmicks, as always, were irrelevant. John Franco knew what mattered as he barked, ''Al Leiter, the man that saved Gotham City.''</p>
        <p>The Mets needed to be saved, which is what Phillips said to Valentine in recent days. As Valentine sat on the dugout steps before the game, he revealed, unsolicited, that Phillips had sent him a message.</p>
        <p>''Steve told me that I have to do something to straighten this out and I understand that,'' Valentine said. ''I'm trying to do everything I can. I've tried meetings. I've tried a lot of individual talks. I've tried lineup changes. I've tried moving guys when we've had people on base. I'll continue to try to do everything I can to contribute to the winning effort of the team.''</p>
        <p>Valentine had preached about how the worst thing a manager can do during bleak periods is suddenly act differently, so he added, ''What that contribution will be will be consistent with what I've done as a manager and what these guys have known me to do as a manager.''</p>
        <p>Phillips uttered, ''Really?'' when he was first told of Valentine's remarks and repeated that they usually speak a few times a day. Phillips could hang a ''Steve's Corner'' sign outside Valentine's office, because he is usually perched there after every game.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't a put pressure on Bobby conversation at all, I don't think,'' Phillips said. ''I'm not clear what he's referring to because yesterday wasn't much different than the day before.''</p>
        <p>Since Valentine had criticized managers who pull starting lineups out of caps and flip over food tables to try and jolt teams out of their doldrums, he was quizzed about his disguise. How was that any different?</p>
        <p>''I think consistency is what counts,'' Valentine said. ''This is something that happened before and it happened again.'' Valentine said he was inspired to use the disguise, but would not divulge what inspired him. ''You might as well have some fun,'' he said. ''Life's too short.''</p>
        <p>That is a refreshing attitude, but it might be risky for a manager whose team is straining and who does not have a contract for 2001. The Mets won so the next discussion between Valentine and Phillips should be more positive.</p>
        <p>Still, the Mets defeated a starter who is 3-17 in Omar Daal and finally stifled a team with the worst record in baseball. They are still chasing the Braves and still trying to outlast the Diamondbacks. Yesterday, the Mets earned a breath. Tonight, they play the Brewers and continue searching for what normalcy used to be.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I'm optimistic, but I also never feel secure until they write your name on the list of the postseason teams,'' Phillips said. ''We've got 162 games. Until they're played, there's nothing you can be comfortable with.''</p>
