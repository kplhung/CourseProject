        <p>Roy Jones Jr.'s fight strategy went beyond another successful title defense Saturday night. Shortly after registering a victory when Eric Harding could not answer the bell for the 11th round because of a torn left biceps, Jones unloaded a plan more intriguing than any punch he threw in the ring in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>Jones said he intended to drop from the light-heavyweight division and face Felix Trinidad or the best available middleweight champion late next year.</p>
        <p>''I'm a true supermiddleweight is what I am, now I get to move down to take on some of the good supermiddleweights,'' Jones said. ''If they got someone pound-to-pound better than me, bring them on. I'd love to see them.''</p>
        <p>The plan was hatched as part of HBO's attempt to re-sign Jones (43-1), whose contract with the cable network expired after his technical knockout of Harding (19-1-1). Seth Abraham, president of Time Warner Sports, HBO's parent company, said Trinidad's camp was receptive to the possibility, which would be contingent on Trinidad's performance in his next three fights.</p>
        <p>Trinidad, who holds the World Boxing Association title, will meet Fernando Vargas, the International Boxing Federation champion, at 154 pounds on Dec. 2. After that, Trinidad would move up to 160 pounds to face the middleweight contenders Keith Holmes and William Joppy, before fighting Jones as a middleweight or a 170-pound light-heavyweight.</p>
        <p>Jones appeared more interested in a possible Trinidad fight than he did in beating Harding, who battled with one arm before the fight was stopped. Harding said he hurt his left biceps in the second round while throwing a left that Jones blocked with his glove.</p>
