        <p>Krenare Abazaga fled Kosovo with her family two years ago. Things were bad. Her best friend was killed by the Serbs.</p>
        <p>But backstage last night in her adopted homeland of the Bronx, surrounded by a fog of hair spray and glitter and cigarette smoke, her hair piled in swirls atop her head, Ms. Abazaga, 16, was not just a refugee.</p>
        <p>She was contestant No. 2.</p>
        <p>''Everybody like to kill us, to take our culture and our language,'' she said as she adjusted her green-and-yellow dress with the scoop neck. ''But we are still alive and we are proud of ourselves. It's something that I like to tell the whole world, that even though we had to separate and go all over the world, we have come back together.''</p>
        <p>Beauty pageants have always been patriotic affairs. But at the first Miss Albania U.S.A. Pageant in New York, at Lehman High School in the Middletown section, the fervor got a little intense at times.</p>
        <p>At the beginning, when 2 of the 13 contestants, Violeta Nikci and Elona Prela, marched out carrying the Albanian and American flags and placed them next to each other, the noise from the 400 or so spectators jamming the auditorium nearly drowned out the thundering drumbeats from the recorded martial music.</p>
        <p>''Since I miss my country so much, the Albanian flag replaces it somehow,'' Ms. Prela, 18, said earlier.</p>
        <p>The pageant's organizer, Shureta Povataj, said: ''Because of the war that's happening, we're trying to restore people's dreams. To try to bring some attention to the brighter side.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Povataj, 27, who runs the Midtown showroom of the decorator F. Schumacher and Company, said she got the idea for the pageant when she went to Kosovo last October to fulfill her father's dying wish: that he be buried in the village where he was born, near Pec.</p>
        <p>''I experienced a lot of what the refugees are seeing, homes burned to the ground, the massive graves,'' she said. ''My relatives, when they were trying to comfort me, were saying, 'At least your father was able to die naturally, no one massacred him, you were able to bury him in one piece.' It was very sad. But I felt proud that people were moving on in life, that with all the destruction that has occurred, they had the will to move on and rebuild their homes and their lives.''</p>
        <p>The contestants, who ranged in age from 16 to 24 and live mostly in the Bronx, home to about 30,000 Albanian-Americans, were vying for a $3,000 prize and a slot in the Miss Albania contest in Tirana.</p>
        <p>But there was also another agenda. Ms. Povataj said she was trying to strike a blow for the liberation of young Albanian-American women.</p>
        <p>''Albanian culture is very conservative,'' she said, ticking off the restrictions that Albanian girls in this country chafe against. Makeup and dating are discouraged, tight clothes considered scandalous. ''I'm trying to break that barrier, and have parents accept that it's O.K. to be fashionable, O.K. to look pretty,'' Ms. Povataj explained, ''that there's nothing wrong with your daughter being in a pageant and showing off her beauty. She's not committing a crime.''</p>
        <p>In fact, said Ms. Povataj, who recruited contestants through ads in local Albanian newspapers and over the Internet, ''We had contestants back out because their families were against it.''</p>
        <p>The father of one contestant, Erjona Boshnjaku, 17, did not want her to take part. ''At first my father said, 'No way, why do you want to do that?' '' Ms. Boshnjaku said. ''But everyone else in my family disagreed. I wanted to do this to show who I am, and my personality, and to show I'm proud to be Albanian.''</p>
        <p>If it seems odd to think of beauty pageants as a force of women's emancipation, consider that when the Miss America Pageant began in 1921, the year after women won the right to vote, it was considered dangerous and subversive and drew protests from religious groups.</p>
        <p>But for all its revolutionary ideology, last night's pageant was pretty old-fashioned. The girls paraded across the stage carrying torches.  They answered questions about what Albania meant to them, and spoke of their hopes and dreams. Ms. Abazaga, a student at Lehman, said she wanted to go to college ''and help my country and my friends and everyone in the world.''</p>
        <p>In between events, the dressing room was a flurry of grooming and teasing and cursing.</p>
        <p>''My hair looks terrible.''</p>
        <p>''That was terrific.''</p>
        <p>''You messed up the dance.'' All that was missing was the bathing-suit competition.</p>
        <p>''Some of the community doesn't like to show the girls in bikinis,''said the producer, Dajan Sukai. ''Next year they will trust me for this thing, but this year we have to be serious.''</p>
        <p>But as the girls came out in Albanian red and black -- red T-shirts tied at the side and emblazoned with the national symbol, a two-headed lion, and black short-shorts -- the audience hooted and shouted.</p>
        <p>''That's our flag, our culture,'' said Mark Krasniqi, 24, a real estate agent.</p>
        <p>(The outfit was also to have included camouflage caps with the logo of the Kosovo Liberation Army, but there were not enough to go around, one contestant said.)</p>
        <p>At the end of the evening, when Ms. Prela, whose career aspiration is to become Miss America, was crowned queen, , the place exploded in cheers.</p>
        <p>''I'm so happy!'' the winner gushed. And she marched the Albanian flag around the stage one more time.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 12, 2000, Tuesday  An article yesterday about the Miss Albania U.S.A. Pageant in New York and a picture caption in some copies misidentified the Albanian national symbol, which was emblazoned on T-shirts worn by the contestants. It is a two-headed eagle, not a two-headed lion.</p>
