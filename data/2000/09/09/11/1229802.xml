        <p>Chuck Knoblauch looked rusty at the plate on the first day he returned to the Yankees' lineup. On the second day, he had some trouble with his throws. On the third day, he looked heavy-legged.</p>
        <p>But on the fourth day, today, Knoblauch seemed comfortable in all that he did, collecting his first hit since he was activated from the disabled list, drawing a walk, stealing a base, and serving as the hinge on a double-play ball hit back to Dwight Gooden in the sixth. ''He's getting into the swing of things,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said.</p>

        <p>Chuck Knoblauch looked rusty at the plate on the first day he returned to the Yankees' lineup. On the second day, he had some trouble with his throws. On the third day, he looked heavy-legged.</p>
        <p>But on the fourth day, today, Knoblauch seemed comfortable in all that he did, collecting his first hit since he was activated from the disabled list, drawing a walk, stealing a base, and serving as the hinge on a double-play ball hit back to Dwight Gooden in the sixth. ''He's getting into the swing of things,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch worked on his throwing mechanics while he was in Tampa, Fla., rehabilitating his sore right elbow, extending his arm, getting away from the clinched, short-arm position with which he often threw in recent years.</p>
        <p>A couple of Knoblauch's throws have been off line since he came back, but for the most part, Knoblauch has been fielding the ball, immediately setting himself, and firing the ball on target. Red Sox fans jeered him all weekend, and Knoblauch wasn't unnerved.</p>
        <p>''He really turned some nice double plays,'' said Tino Martinez, the Yankees' first baseman.</p>
        <p>Torre, who has been replacing Knoblauch with Jose Vizcaino late in games for defensive purposes, said that while Knoblauch still might have some lingering pain in his elbow, he is playing through it.</p>
        <p>Dream Duty for Sick Boy</p>
        <p>Waiting for his turn in batting practice this morning, Derek Jeter nudged the batboy standing next to him. Then Jeter nudged him again, and again, and 6-year-old Michael Romano smiled.</p>
        <p>Michael, who was found to have cancer 20 months ago, spent the weekend with the Yankees, hanging out with the players in the clubhouse, wearing a Yankees jersey, stretching with them before batting practice, eating with them before and after games, sitting next to Scott Brosius, Tino Martinez and the rest.</p>
        <p>Michael, of Bayonne, N.J., recently completed experimental antibody treatment at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He is a Yankees fan, and Jeter is his favorite player. ''What's your favorite position?'' Jeter asked Michael, who was sitting at Jeter's locker this morning.</p>
        <p>Michael shrugged, and smiled. ''You don't have a favorite position?'' Jeter asked. ''I know this, for a fact -- you like to eat. You eat like Brosius.''</p>
        <p>The boy, videotaped by his father all weekend, said the favorite part of his experience was being on the field, seeing players, bringing bats to them. ''Jeter played around with me,'' he said. ''He did other stuff, too.''</p>
        <p>As the Yankees left today, they signed items for Michael. ''I got a lot of autographs,'' he said.</p>
