        <p>Human Genome Sciences, a company that is developing drugs based on discovery of genes, said yesterday that it had acquired privately held Principia Pharmaceutical for about $120 million in stock. Principia, based in Norristown, Pa., is developing a technology that could enhance the effectiveness of human proteins used as drugs.</p>
        <p>Dozens of human proteins, made in bacterial or mammalian cells using genetic engineering, are now used as drugs, including insulin for diabetes, human growth factor for dwarfism and erythropoietin for anemia. One problem is that such proteins are often cleared from the bloodstream within minutes, meaning that high doses and frequent injections are needed.</p>

        <p>Human Genome Sciences, a company that is developing drugs based on discovery of genes, said yesterday that it had acquired privately held Principia Pharmaceutical for about $120 million in stock. Principia, based in Norristown, Pa., is developing a technology that could enhance the effectiveness of human proteins used as drugs.</p>
        <p>Dozens of human proteins, made in bacterial or mammalian cells using genetic engineering, are now used as drugs, including insulin for diabetes, human growth factor for dwarfism and erythropoietin for anemia. One problem is that such proteins are often cleared from the bloodstream within minutes, meaning that high doses and frequent injections are needed.</p>
        <p>Principia's technology, which was licensed from Aventis, fuses the drug protein with human albumin, an abundant protein in the blood. The result is a protein that should act like the drug but stay in the bloodstream as long as albumin, meaning for days.</p>
        <p>''If you can inject a drug once every two weeks or once a month instead of once a day, you have a major advantage,'' said William A. Haseltine, chief executive of Human Genome Sciences. The company, based in Rockville, Md., will use the technology on its own drugs and also offer it to other manufacturers, he said.</p>
        <p>Principia's technology has not yet been used in any drug on the market or in clinical trials. There are many other methods also being tried or already in use to make longer-lasting protein drugs.</p>
        <p>Schering-Plough and Roche are each awaiting government approval to sell hepatitis C treatments made by linking an interferon protein to a chemical called polyethylene glycol. Amgen is awaiting approval for a longer-lasting form of erythropoietin made by modifying some protein components and attaching extra sugars.</p>
