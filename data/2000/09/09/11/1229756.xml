        <p>It may be too early to talk about the reinvented Dick Cheney. But the Republican vice-presidential nominee, who has found himself fighting a reputation for woodenness not unlike that of the vice president he is trying to replace, has been making a few readjustments lately.</p>
        <p>It all began on Monday with his decision to leave his motorcade behind and ride the Chicago El to a Polish festival. (Of course, while he managed to shake a few hands with everyday straphangers, he spent almost the entire ride talking with two local Republican elected officials.) Then, at the festival, he danced the polka with a Polish beauty queen. (''He danced good,'' she said gallantly.) It was all something of a retooling for Mr. Cheney, the former secretary of defense, whose selection in July brought the word ''gravitas'' back into vogue.</p>

        <p>It may be too early to talk about the reinvented Dick Cheney. But the Republican vice-presidential nominee, who has found himself fighting a reputation for woodenness not unlike that of the vice president he is trying to replace, has been making a few readjustments lately.</p>
        <p>It all began on Monday with his decision to leave his motorcade behind and ride the Chicago El to a Polish festival. (Of course, while he managed to shake a few hands with everyday straphangers, he spent almost the entire ride talking with two local Republican elected officials.) Then, at the festival, he danced the polka with a Polish beauty queen. (''He danced good,'' she said gallantly.) It was all something of a retooling for Mr. Cheney, the former secretary of defense, whose selection in July brought the word ''gravitas'' back into vogue.</p>
        <p>As the week continued, he began to use his hands more to make points while speaking. And on Thursday, while addressing workers at a factory in Londonderry, N.H., that  makes night-vision goggles for the military, he actually stepped from behind the lectern -- wired with a body microphone.</p>
        <p>By Friday, Mr. Cheney was relaxed enough to make this pledge at a fund-raiser in Burlington, Vt., ''We're going to work our fannies off from now till Nov. 7.''</p>
        <p>All of this occurred during a week in which some Republicans, concerned about the skidding poll numbers of their ticket, began openly questioning the wisdom of Gov. George W. Bush in choosing Mr. Cheney. Some pointed to the questions raised about his compensation package with his previous employer, while others said his laid-back style came up short in comparison with his Democratic counterpart, Joseph I. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>And, to be sure, Mr. Cheney seems most at ease delivering policy speeches on the military he once led or in small, controlled gatherings.  Life on a national ticket is still a bit of an adjustment. While he spent more than two decades in Washington politics, he was an elected official for less than half of that time -- as the congressman from Wyoming, where campaigning is a bit different.</p>
        <p>''You might drive 150 miles and have coffee with five or six guys,'' he recalled this week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney is not exactly the kind of politician who goes around kissing babies. The opportunity came up on Wednesday when he met with the Lierenz family -- John, Sherry, and 9-month-old Jessalyn -- in Wilmington, Del., to talk about the benefits they could expect under Gov. George W. Bush's proposed tax cut. ''He kind of shook her hand,'' Mr. Lierenz said.</p>
        <p>'Tax Families' Pop Up</p>
        <p>Families like the Lierenzes --  known as ''tax families'' in campaign parlance -- have become a fixture on the trail.</p>
        <p>They began popping up soon after Governor Bush acknowledged that he needed to do a better job explaining his proposed $1.3 billion tax cut, and to counter claims by Mr. Gore that the cuts would mainly benefit the wealthy. Mr. Cheney has even appropriated one of Mr. Gore's refrains, promising to fight for working families.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Cheney's arguments is that Mr. Gore's more modest tax cut  relies too much on tax credits for which only some people will qualify. ''The Gore plan basically is really a spending program administered by the I.R.S. with a whole bunch of specific provisions in it that you get only if you have solar panels or drive a battery-powered car or if you're engaged in some kind of activity that they want to encourage,'' he said in Delaware.</p>
        <p>Of course, many of the tax families trotted out on the trail would benefit most from another tax credit: Mr. Bush's proposal to double the tax credit for families, to $1,000 per child.</p>
        <p>A Favorite Phrase</p>
        <p>While it did not attract nearly as much attention as the vulgarity that Governor Bush let slip in front of an open microphone in Illinois last Monday while describing a New York Times reporter in what he thought was a private aside, Mr. Cheney's ready agreement with the assessment -- ''Oh, yeah, he is, big time'' --  got its own share of attention.</p>
        <p>It got a few guffaws from David Letterman, who suggested on his show that Mr. Cheney was simply acting as the yes man. And it triggered a moment of recognition of sorts in Mr. Letterman's band leader and sidekick, Paul Shaffer. ''That's like what I have to say all the time,'' Mr. Shaffer said.</p>
        <p>The flap did not force Mr. Cheney to refrain from using what seems to be a favorite expression. While talking on Wednesday about his security and loss of privacy since joining the race, he got a few unintended laughs when he explained that ''The Secret Service descended -- big time.''</p>
        <p>And the line even popped up at a rally in Vermont, where Mike Popowski, a former infantry captain who served in Vietnam, gave Mr. Cheney one the most enthusiastic introductions yet in the campaign.</p>
        <p>''Today, we all have great concern for our military -- its lack of readiness, its low morale,'' Mr. Popowski said, echoing a central theme of the Bush-Cheney ticket. ''Veterans regret this most of all. That wouldn't have been the case eight years ago when our commander in chief was George Bush and he and Dick Cheney were running the show. Then, excellence was in season for our fighting men and women -- big time. Big time.'' The crowd went wild.</p>
