        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report that musicians, who lose copyrights under work-for-hire contracts with record companies, seek to be treated like book authors ''whose right to regain the rights to their works is not disputed'' (news article, Sept. 4).</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report that musicians, who lose copyrights under work-for-hire contracts with record companies, seek to be treated like book authors ''whose right to regain the rights to their works is not disputed'' (news article, Sept. 4).</p>
        <p>Would that this were so! Even though copyright law suggests that works by one author cannot be considered works-for-hire, many book publishers insist that some writers relinquish their copyrights and accept work-for-hire contracts. ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'' novels are familiar examples of this practice. And at times, publishers have even claimed copyright ownership merely for suggesting a novel's premise.</p>
        <p>Alas, musicians cannot point to the book business as a perfect model of fair treatment of a work's creator.</p>
        <p>DONALD MAASS  New York, Sept. 5, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is president, American Assn. of Authors' Representatives.</p>
