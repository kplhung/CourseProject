        <p>The first play of the second quarter in the Silverdome today looked like the one that would decide this brawl between the Washington Redskins and the Detroit Lions. Kelvin Pritchett, the Lions' 6-foot-3-inch, 319-pound defensive tackle, caught a deflected pass thrown by Brad Johnson and ran with it. He labored down the left sideline, all the way inside the Redskins' 1-yard line. That was where he was finally caught and tackled -- after a 78-yard return -- by guard Tre Johnson.</p>
        <p>Detroit was ahead, 3-0. The Lions were inches from the goal line, and a 10-0 lead looked certain. But three plays later, the Lions had lost a yard and were kicking a field goal. They had gained only a small piece of what should have been. How would they overcome that in a game against a team with an array of bright stars? The Redskins entered today's game as the team of the galaxy, while the Lions were considered more like a cluster of dull asteroids.</p>

        <p>The first play of the second quarter in the Silverdome today looked like the one that would decide this brawl between the Washington Redskins and the Detroit Lions. Kelvin Pritchett, the Lions' 6-foot-3-inch, 319-pound defensive tackle, caught a deflected pass thrown by Brad Johnson and ran with it. He labored down the left sideline, all the way inside the Redskins' 1-yard line. That was where he was finally caught and tackled -- after a 78-yard return -- by guard Tre Johnson.</p>
        <p>Detroit was ahead, 3-0. The Lions were inches from the goal line, and a 10-0 lead looked certain. But three plays later, the Lions had lost a yard and were kicking a field goal. They had gained only a small piece of what should have been. How would they overcome that in a game against a team with an array of bright stars? The Redskins entered today's game as the team of the galaxy, while the Lions were considered more like a cluster of dull asteroids.</p>
        <p>''That team over there, they have all of the free agents, the big stars, and they are good,'' Pritchett said of the Redskins. ''But this is a football team that will give you effort. We aren't spectacular, but we do fight.''</p>
        <p>Fight and compete. That is what the Lions did. They beat Washington, 15-10, before 74,159 contented fans who saw Detroit climb to a 2-0 record and Washington slip to 1-1. Lions fans saw their team, which has yet to score an offensive touchdown this season, win again by staying close, playing rugged defense and making game-swinging plays in the end.</p>
        <p>Detroit won with five Jason Hanson field goals, of 49, 20, 54, 37 and 35 yards. Detroit won with quarterback Charlie Batch making his first start of the season after nursing a knee injury. He signed a four-year, $31 million contract last week. Detroit won by repeatedly attacking cornerback Deion Sanders with receivers Germane Crowell and Johnnie Morton.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Detroit defense intercepted Brad Johnson four times. The last one saved the game.</p>
        <p>Washington began a drive at its 11-yard line with 1 minute 59 seconds remaining. They moved to the Detroit 32. On a first-and-5 play, Johnson tried to zip a pass to Albert Connell, who had run a curl route over the middle. Cornerback Terry Fair, however, read it, timed it, dived for it and caught it at the Detroit 20 with 49 seconds left. Game over.</p>
        <p>''Everybody thought that because of the way they handled us in the playoffs last year in their stadium, that our defense was weak and our secondary was lame,'' Fair said. ''I think the way we played today might have left them and others a little confused.''</p>
        <p>Today, at least, the Lions showed that they are willing to battle for four quarters. They move the ball enough on offense to rest their defense. They ran for 1 yard in the first half and trailed by 7-6, but by game's end had gained a net 62 rushing yards, with the big back James Stewart gaining 65. Their special teams were good, not letting Sanders break away on punt returns.</p>
        <p>''It was a very, very, very tough football game for both teams, very physical,'' Lions Coach Bobby Ross said. ''When we didn't score the touchdown after that long return in the second quarter, well, that was a big series. But this is a team that doesn't let up.'' In the end, Batch outplayed Brad Johnson, who passed for 245 yards and a touchdown of 5 yards to tight end Stephen Alexander that gave Washington its halftime lead. But Johnson's interceptions were killers.</p>
        <p>''We kept them in the ballgame,'' Redskins defensive end Bruce Smith said. ''We made sure they had opportunities in the end, and on the road you can't do that.''</p>
        <p>On attacking Sanders, Morton said: ''I was pretty surprised that we had success and kept doing it. He is one of the greatest defensive backs of all time, but we didn't think of him in that way. We just ran our offense and Charlie went to spots he felt comfortable with. I think Deion was surprised. He kind of had that look in his eye at the end of the game that all day long we had caught him off guard.'' Most of the Redskins had that look, one that suggested they had lost the fight.</p>
        <p>''Our mentality now is so different,'' Lions end Robert Porcher said. ''If we can just keep healthy, this is the first of many surprises.''</p>
