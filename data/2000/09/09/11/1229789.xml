      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial urges closing of loophole in Medicaid law that is being sued by 17 states, including New York, to inflate their costs and thereby extract more federal money than they are entitled to; says loophole could cost Washington up to $80 billion over the next five years and undermine political support for program</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>New York and 16 other states are manipulating Medicaid reimbursement laws to pull billions more dollars out of Washington than Congress intends. Some states use the largesse to treat the poor. Others use the windfall to pay ordinary bills. Either way the practice should be curtailed before it undermines political support for the always-embattled Medicaid program.</p>
        <p>Washington is supposed to pay between 50 percent and 73 percent of Medicaid costs, depending on the state. But a loophole lets a state inflate its costs above what they actually are, thereby extracting more money from Washington than the state deserves. Take a state whose federal share is 50 percent. It might pay nursing homes $80 a day to care for Medicaid patients, but federal law might permit that state to pay as much as, say, $100. Under the loophole, the state in effect pays the nursing home $80 but charges the federal government as if it were paying $100. The state collects half of $100 rather than half of $80, raising Washington's share to 63 percent from 50 percent.</p>

        <p>Washington is supposed to pay between 50 percent and 73 percent of Medicaid costs, depending on the state. But a loophole lets a state inflate its costs above what they actually are, thereby extracting more money from Washington than the state deserves. Take a state whose federal share is 50 percent. It might pay nursing homes $80 a day to care for Medicaid patients, but federal law might permit that state to pay as much as, say, $100. Under the loophole, the state in effect pays the nursing home $80 but charges the federal government as if it were paying $100. The state collects half of $100 rather than half of $80, raising Washington's share to 63 percent from 50 percent.</p>
        <p>The loophole could cost Washington up to $80 billion over the next five years. An ''early alert'' prepared by the inspector general says the three states examined did not use the ill-gotten money to improve the quality of health care.</p>
        <p>The administration has warned the states that it intends to eliminate the loophole. Its stance deserves support for reasons that go beyond good governance. In the early 1990's states exploited a similar loophole, driving up Medicaid costs by 25 percent or so a year. Congress struck back, coming close to ending the Medicaid entitlement, by which states lay automatic claim to extra federal money when Medicaid rolls rise.</p>
        <p>If the administration lets the latest loophole remain, the costs could become huge, compelling Congress to cut back Medicaid reimbursements. New York -- which uses the loophole to collect about $480 million of the more than $14 billion it draws from Washington each year to pay for Medicaid -- and other states with large Medicaid rolls would become the big losers.</p>
        <p>The administration has promised to phase out the loophole and pledged to help states that need more money to care for the poor by lobbying Congress for a direct allocation of new money. Several consumer groups that work on behalf of health care for the poor, like Families USA, support the administration because the loophole diverts money from the federal Medicaid program to pay for other state programs.</p>
