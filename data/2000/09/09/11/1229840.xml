        <p>Zdeno Chara will be playing for the Islanders this year, after all. So will Brad Isbister.</p>
        <p>After an appeal from the players, led by goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck, the owner Charles Wang reversed his decision to lock out Chara, a 6-foot-9-inch defenseman, who had rejected on Thursday a three-year deal worth $2.4 million.</p>
        <p>Chara and Isbister, whose Islander-imposed deadline was yesterday, accepted one-year deals at 10 percent over last year's base salary. Chara will earn $632,500, while Isbister will be paid $385,000. The players are not eligible for arbitration.</p>
        <p>''The one-year deal buys us time to negotiate a long-term deal over the winter,'' the Islanders' general manager, Mike Milbury, said. ''Deep in my heart I'm glad Charles did change his mind. It was not easy for him.''</p>
        <p>In the 45-minute meeting at the team's training camp headquarters in Lake Placid, N.Y., Vanbiesbrouck, along with Dave Scatchard, Bill Muckalt, Kenny Jonsson, Roman Hamrlik and others, emphasized to Wang and the co-owner Sanjay Kumar, the Computer Associates executives who bought the team this spring, how important it was to have Chara and Isbister this season.</p>
        <p>''If we're going to improve this hockey club, we need these guys, Vanbiesbrouck said later.''</p>
        <p>Isbister, the second-leading scorer on the Islanders last year with 22 goals, and Chara are expected to be in training camp today.</p>
