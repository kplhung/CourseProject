        <p>Juan Antonio Samaranch missed his bus, but Marie Stewart and 80,000 other sports fans Saturday night gave an Olympics-eve passing grade to Sydney's recently troubled public transport system.</p>
        <p>Samaranch, the president of the International Olympic Committee, and Stewart, a specialist nurse, were both bound for Olympic Park, the billion-dollar cluster of arenas built for 16 of the 28 sports of the 2000 Games starting here on Friday.</p>
        <p>Samaranch, intending to inspect the site's 1,600-room television and radio center, waited 30 minutes at his city hotel for a V.I.P. minibus that went somewhere else. He canceled his trip.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Stewart and her 18-year-old daughter, Maize, took a trouble-free 10-mile, 30-minute train ride to Stadium Australia, the 110,000-seat Olympic centerpiece to watch a four-hour dress rehearsal of the opening ceremony.</p>
        <p>There were a few glitches in the rehearsal that the ceremony director, Ric Birch, said he could fix at a final rehearsal on Wednesday, but there were no delays in the train and bus services. Their recent errors and accidents have reminded I.O.C. and Sydney officials of transport failures at the 1996 Atlanta Games.</p>
        <p>Accidents, equipment failures and careless service have recently plagued Sydney suburban trains. There have been more than 30 derailments this year and 60 drivers suspended for errors.</p>
        <p>Bus problems have been caused by Olympic expansion. With some 1,000 buses and 500 drivers from out-of-town private fleets reinforcing the 2,500-vehicle government network in Sydney, the learning curve is steep.</p>
