        <p>THIS SPORT, which goes back to 600 B.C., tests five skills of a 19th century military courier. To make room for women to compete in the Olympic pentathlon for the first time, the fields were reduced, and all 24 men and 24 women had to qualify.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP --The five events were once spread over five days, then four. Now the Olympic competition will be held over one day, starting at 7:30 a.m. and ending between 5 and 6 p.m.</p>

        <p>THIS SPORT, which goes back to 600 B.C., tests five skills of a 19th century military courier. To make room for women to compete in the Olympic pentathlon for the first time, the fields were reduced, and all 24 men and 24 women had to qualify.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP --The five events were once spread over five days, then four. Now the Olympic competition will be held over one day, starting at 7:30 a.m. and ending between 5 and 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- In order, the pentathletes fire an air pistol 20 times at a 10-meter target, then fence all 23 opponents with an epee, then swim 200 meters, then warm up for 20 minutes on a horse chosen in a blind draw and ride it over 12 jumps on a 600-meter course.</p>
        <p>Then the point scores are totaled and converted via a decathlon-like table to minutes and seconds. The athletes are placed in scoring order for the final event, a 3,000-meter cross-country run. The scoring leader starts first, and the others follow at intervals determined by their scores. The first to finish the run wins the gold medal.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- With a point system operating like track and field's decathlon, the athletes cannot succeed with a weak event. So their training, difficult at best, becomes longer as they try to upgrade shaky events.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- Hungary, Russia and France have the best men; Poland, Britain and Hungary the best women.</p>
        <p>The individual favorites are Andrejus Zadneprovskis of Lithuania (men) and Zsuzsa Voros of Hungary (women). Velizar Iliev and Mary Beth Larsen-Iagorashvili, both of San Antonio are medal contenders.</p>
