        <p>ONE OF the grand and sometimes hoary traditions of soccer is that every tournament no matter how big or small, must have a Group of Death. That is to say, one bracket is inevitably stronger than the others.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the Grupo de Muerte is a cliche, but at these Summer Games it is a fact. The defending women's Olympic and World Cup champions -- one and the same -- from the United States have been placed in the brutal half of the draw.</p>
        <p>The Americans -- heroes of Atlanta, the stars of Pasadena -- must play Norway first, then China and then Nigeria, with only two of those four teams going to the semifinals. The lopsided draw came about because the host team, Australia -- perhaps the weakest team in the Olympic tournament -- was automatically seeded first, somehow winding up in a group with Germany, Sweden and Brazil.</p>
        <p>This arrangement is serious business.</p>
        <p>Apart from the Women's World Cup, now a legitimate worldwide attraction due to American marketing in 1999, the Olympics are the biggest event for female players. Failing to get to the semifinals would be a jolt to China or Norway or the United States, and that is precisely what is going to happen.</p>
        <p>THE WOMEN -- The American women are now coached by April Heinrichs, a former star. They are sending 14 of the 18 players who won the 1999 World Cup -- Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly, et al.</p>
        <p>But there has been considerable retooling, with Michelle Akers announcing her retirement. Siri Mullinix may have supplanted Briana Scurry in goal, and the veteran defender Carla Overbeck will be more marginal this time around.</p>
        <p>THE MEN -- The men's tournament is the usual hybrid Olympic affair, essentially a 23-and-under championship spiced with a maximum of three older players per team.</p>
        <p>Brazil declined to bolster its squad after a team psychologist deduced that the younger players' egos would be hurt by the inclusion of older players. The Americans did not publicly voice such touchy-feely sentiments. Coach Clive Charles picked up Jeff Agoos, 32; Frankie Hejduk, 26; and Brad Friedel, 29.</p>
        <p>The rest of the squad consists of decent younger players from Major League Soccer and European teams, plus one college player. The Yanks will play the Czech Republic, Cameroon and Kuwait, hoping to be one of two teams from the group to advance to the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>They will surely insist that they, too, have been placed in the Gruppo di Morte. Just about everybody claims that.</p>
