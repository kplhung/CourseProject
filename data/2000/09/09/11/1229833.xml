        <p>Gaviola may not be headed for the Breeders' Cup, but the 3-year-old filly achieved a short-term goal yesterday when she won a Grade I stakes and ran her winning streak to six races.</p>
        <p>The gray daughter of Cozzene swept to a convincing victory by three lengths in the Garden City Breeders' Cup Handicap at Belmont Park; she has not lost since January. She stayed close to the lead until the homestretch, then cruised to the front under Jerry Bailey and widened her margin over the late-running British filly, Flawly, who rallied from last place to second, ahead of Millie's Quest.</p>
        <p>The victory was also the first in a Grade I stakes in 20 years for Gaviola's trainer, Billy Turner. Gaviola ran the mile and an eighth in 1:48 4/5, paid $2.90 for a $2 bet as the heavy favorite and earned $150,000. Turner continued to deny that he would enter his star in the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf race, which will be run at a mile and a quarter at Churchill Downs on Nov. 4, and which he believes may be too far for Gaviola.</p>
        <p>''I would have to say that to get us to the Breeders' Cup, Turner said, they would have to put a hook around me and drag me there.''</p>
