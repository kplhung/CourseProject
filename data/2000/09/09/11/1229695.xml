        <p>AS MARION JONES TELLS the story, she was an 8-year-old in Southern California when the Olympics first entered her head like a song that would not leave. Her family drove to see the Olympic torch as the relay made its way to the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. Back at home that same night, she went into her room and wrote ''I want to be an Olympic champion'' on a chalkboard.</p>
        <p>Sixteen years later, at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, Jones is atempting to become the first woman to win five gold medals in track and field at the same Olympics. Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands won four at the 1948 London Games. Paavo Nurmi, the great Finn, won five golds in the men's competition in the 1924 Paris Games, including the 1,500 and 5,000 meters within an hour, but three of his victories came in team and cross-country events that have since been discontinued.</p>
        <p>The Sydney Games will run from Sept. 15 through Oct. 1, early spring in the Southern Hemisphere. While swimming will dominate the first week of competition, and the Australian teenage sensation Ian Thorpe is expected to become a huge international star, Jones's quest to win five gold medals will play like a miniseries on NBC during the second week of the Games.</p>
        <p>Her attempt will be as difficult as it is unprecedented. While Jones has the fastest time in the world this year at 100 meters (10.78 seconds) and 200 meters (21.94), she has only the fourth-best long jump (23 feet  1/2 inch), a full 11 inches short of her career best. Her form is awkward and her jumping has been erratic. At a meet in Brussels against the top Olympic contenders on Aug. 25, Jones finished fifth, failing to reach even 22 feet.</p>
        <p>And, with fierce international competition and the risk of baton exchanges on the 4x100-meter and 4x400 relays, there is no certainty that the Americans will win gold medals. Without Jones, the United States finished fourth in the 4x100 relay at the 1999 world track and field championships and second in the 4x400 relay, where Germany and Russia are considered the favorites.</p>
        <p>Jones has run only one 400-meter race this season -- her time of 49.59 seconds would have won the 1999 world championships -- but she has not trained regularly for the event since May.</p>
        <p>The cold, windy weather that is expected in Sydney could also play havoc with the results. Fatigue and injuries could be disruptive through four rounds apiece of the 100 and the 200. A year ago, Jones hurt her knee with a clumsy landing in the long jump and later pulled up with back spasms during the semifinals of the 200 meters at the world championships. Many track people believe her faulty jumping technique may have contributed to the back spasms, although Jones strongly disputes that the two were related.</p>
        <p>Still, Jones has not lost a sprint final since Sept. 6, 1997, and her charismatic, resourceful presence lends wondrous possibility to her attempt to win five gold medals in Sydney. She has assumed the mantle from the retired Jackie Joyner-Kersee as the most versatile female athlete in the country. Like Joyner-Kersee, Jones also excelled at basketball. As a freshman point guard, she guided the University of North Carolina to a national collegiate championship in 1994, leading the swiftest fast break in the history of women's basketball.</p>
        <p>This Olympic season, Jones has been the focus of a corporate full-court press that is unparalleled for a female athlete heading into the Summer Games. Figure skaters almost always sparkle as the brightest stars in the constellation of winter athletes. In the summer, many women have emerged as the most compelling performers -- from Mildred (Babe) Didrickson to Blankers-Koen to Olga Korbut to Nadia Comaneci -- but never has a female athlete provided the dominant story line, or been so heavily promoted, in advance of the Summer Games.</p>
        <p>Part of Jones's appeal is that her husband, C. J. Hunter, is the world champion in the shot-put. They could become the first married couple to win his and her gold medals at one Olympics since Emil Zatopek won the 5,000 meters, 10,000 meters and the marathon, and Dana Zatopek won the javelin at the 1952 Helsinki Games. But Hunter's participation is now in question after recent knee surgery.</p>
        <p>Still, it is Jones's unique attempt to win five golds, not her gold wedding band, that has driven promotional campaigns by NBC, Nike, Gatorade, Panasonic, General Motors, AT&amp;T, TAG Heuer watches and Kellogg's Frosted Flakes.</p>
        <p>''She has already received more attention in terms of national television advertising campaigns than any athlete in history, more than Michael Jordan at one time,'' said Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of the United States track and field federation, the sport's national governing body. ''At least five national television campaigns. NBC has said her story will be a nightly soap opera. This is a real athletic challenge, not some sort of hype. To achieve it would be an extremely meaningful athletic event, in the way that Tiger Woods winning three straight majors is a real achievement.''</p>
        <p>A Star's Boundless Possibilities</p>
        <p>Five gold medals would most likely give Jones the earning power of Mia Hamm, the soccer star, but would not put her in the category of the world's top female tennis players, said Bob Williams, president of the Chicago-based Burns Sports, which matches athletes with advertisers.</p>
        <p>Jones is limited because track and field registers on the American public radar only once every four years during the Olympics, Williams said. But, given the singularity of her potential accomplishment, the universality of her sport and the potential longevity of her Olympic career, Masback believes that Jones could become the first female athlete to truly transcend sport internationally.</p>
        <p>Only 24, and earning an estimated several million dollars a year, Jones could compete in the Olympics through 2008, by which time she could surpass Nurmi's 10 career gold medals and the 9 won by Carl Lewis. Sylvia Hatchell, who coaches women's basketball at North Carolina, has said that Jones could compete in two Olympics as a track athlete and a third in basketball.</p>
        <p>Jones has also mentioned the possibility of playing eventually in the Women's National Basketball Association, which could put her in the same rarefied class as Didrickson, who dominated track and field and the women's golf circuit in the 1930's.</p>
        <p>''There is no context to this, because no one has ever tried it,'' Masback said of Jones. ''How many countries participated in the 1,500 and 5,000 when Nurmi won? If it was more than 15 or 20, I'd be surprised. There is a different level of competition now. If there are fewer than 75 countries participating in the women's 100 meters, I'd be surprised.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Tennis is an international sport, but how many countries are serious contenders? Track and field is truly the international sport for women. Sri Lanka wins medals. Kenya wins medals. Arab women are winning Olympic titles.</p>
        <p>''Nothing against Mia Hamm, she's a great athlete, but you can't transcend your sport internationally if your sport isn't practiced and respected internationally. Marion has got a unique opportunity to transcend sport as Pele, Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan have. There's time to ultimately achieve that. But it's something you've got to do over time.''</p>
        <p>The last woman to receive this kind of feverish attention before a Summer Games was Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands in 1948, according to Bud Greenspan, the Olympic documentarian. But, he said, journalists were writing about the Dutch star for entirely different reasons, mortified that a mother of two would leave her children at home to compete in something as sweaty as track and field.</p>
        <p>''I was 30 and people said I was too old, that it was not good to be running if you had a baby, that you should do the housekeeping rather than running in shorts in a stadium,'' Blankers-Koen, still spry at 82, said in an interview. ''But I was not listening to them. I did what I wanted to do.''</p>
        <p>At those London Games, Blankers-Koen won the 100, 200, 80-meter hurdles and the 4x100-meter relay and leaped significant cultural barriers. She could easily have won five gold medals, but she skipped the long jump at which she held the world record, because of scheduling conflicts.</p>
        <p>''I have no regrets,'' Blankers-Koen said last month. She met Jones for the first time last summer in Monte Carlo, Monaco, and verbally passed the torch of Olympic achievement, saying, ''If you stay fit, you can win five gold medals.''</p>
        <p>''She is so fast, so good running in the last meters of a race,'' Blankers-Koen said.</p>
        <p>Motivated by Doubters and Critics</p>
        <p>Even in this day, though, women are still facing skepticism from those who would define their ambitions for them. Jones has constantly fielded questions about why she has not dropped the long jump, given her unreliable form.</p>
        <p>The mere announcement that she intended to win five gold medals seemed too bold and off-putting to some who were threatened by, or dismissive of, the accomplishments of female athletes. But Jones has used the doubts and criticisms for motivation. Like Blankers-Koen, she has a kind of necessary audaciousness to succeed.</p>
        <p>''I've always wanted to do something that's never been done,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Jones wants to be world renowned because she was threatened with personal anonymity as a girl, having been ignored by her father, who was divorced from her mother and was seldom in her life, skipping her high school graduation and important moments in her sports career.</p>
        <p>But there is no real desperation in her speed. She has been fast for as long as she can remember, beating boys up and down the block in Palmdale, Calif., catching them easily in games of tag. Her brother Albert, five years older, always chose her for pick-up games, Jones said, ''not because I was his little sister, but because I could make a difference.''</p>
        <p>As she watched on television as the 1984 Summer Games unfolded in nearby Los Angeles, Jones said, ''When I saw athletes cross the finish line and, excitement cross their faces, I knew I wanted to experience that.'' A year later, as a 9-year-old, she wrote in a class paper, ''I like to run because I can beat almost everyone at my school.''</p>
        <p>Before her senior year of high school, Jones qualified for the 1992 Olympic team on the 4x100-meter relay, having finished fourth at the Olympic trials at 200 meters. She declined to participate in the Barcelona Games, however. She said she wanted her first gold medal to come in an individual event, ''something I sweated for and earned.'' Her mother, Marion Toler, has said that she did not allow Jones to compete because her grades had not been sufficient during her junior year. Instead, Jones stayed home and took a math class.</p>
        <p>''It is difficult as a 15- or 16-year-old, when you have a chance to go to the Olympics and your friends are going to the pool,'' Jones said. ''But I have no regrets. I know we made the right decision.''</p>
        <p>She never lost a high school race after her freshman year. Her track career, however, was nearly undermined, perhaps forever, during her senior year. Jones faced a four-year ban from competition for failing to show up to take a mandatory urine test for performance-enhancing drugs. Her mother hired the lawyer Johnnie Cochran, who successfully argued to track officials that Jones's coach had not received notification of the test until after it had been scheduled. The ban was not enforced.</p>
        <p>She got an athletic scholarship to the University of North Carolina, where her speed was most evident on the basketball court, not the track. Jones had averaged 22.8 points a game as a high school senior and was named the California player of the year. Her first year in college, she waved the checkered flag as the Tar Heels drag-raced to a national title.</p>
        <p>''A lot of folks thought I had thrown track out of the window,'' Jones said. ''I wanted to fulfill my dream playing ball. I had enormous passion for the game. When I was 50 or 60, sitting on the porch drinking lemonade, I didn't want to say, 'Would have, could have.' I'm glad I did it.''</p>
        <p>Hatchell, the North Carolina basketball coach, said that Jones was ''the most complete athlete I have ever coached.'' But basketball also left Jones with a broken bone in her left foot, ending any chance of sprinting and long-jumping at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Tension also developed between Hatchell and Jones over the direction of her career and her relationship with Hunter, who grew up in Hyde Park, N.Y., and who became an assistant track coach at North Carolina in 1995. Jones and Hunter, who was separated from his wife and had two young children, began dating in early 1996, in violation of university policy, which prohibited coaches from dating athletes.</p>
        <p>The two tried to keep their relationship quiet, Jones said, but it became public. She said that North Carolina's head track coach, Dennis Craddock, called Hunter into a meeting and told him, ''Either you quit or we have to let you go.''</p>
        <p>''There was no decision for C. J.,'' Jones said. ''He quit the job.''</p>
        <p>Hunter finished seventh in the shot-put at the Atlanta Olympics, as Jones sat in the stands and watched. Her own Olympic hopes, thwarted twice already, began to stir again. In the spring of 1997, as she prepared to graduate from North Carolina, Jones decided to become a professional track athlete, even though she had a year of basketball eligibility remaining.</p>
        <p>Jones said that Hatchell tried to discourage her from resuming her track career, while Hatchell has said that she did no arm-twisting. In April 1997, the coach said, Jones told her, ''I want to go out and be the fastest woman in the world.''</p>
        <p>''By the middle of June, she was,'' Hatchell said. ''When Marion tells you something, you can go ahead and put your money in the bank.''</p>
        <p>No Thanks to All the Advice</p>
        <p>After having been away from track for two years, Jones won the 100 meters at the 1997 world championships in Athens. A year later, she long-jumped 23-11 3/4 and won 35 of the 36 sprint and jumping competitions that she entered. That year, she ran the 100 in 10.65 and the 200 in 21.62. Only Florence Griffith-Joyner had run faster in either event. The Sydney Olympics were still two years away, but the chance of winning five gold medals became a tantalizing possibility.</p>
        <p>Last year, though, it became apparent that the achievement would be as arduous as it would be astonishing. Her long-jumping suffered, and after she pulled up with an injured back at the 1999 world championships in Seville, Spain, Jones left without speaking to anyone, not even to officials from USA Track &amp; Field, to explain what caused the injury. It seemed curious, considering that she has a degree in communications.</p>
        <p>Hunter is a gruff person who says, if it were up to him, he would do no interviews, answer no questions, ''just go to meets and go home.''</p>
        <p>His defensiveness contributed to Jones's silence about Seville until this past spring. It was a huge public relations gaffe, and evidence that the pressure to win five gold medals might have been growing too burdensome.</p>
        <p>Experts in the long jump, including the world record-holder, Mike Powell, have also said that Hunter has rebuffed efforts from those who would offer advice to Jones. She has said that she will remain loyal to her coach, Trevor Graham, who, in turn, has accused Powell and others of being publicity hounds. She has decided to rely on her speed instead of refining her technique, but she has struggled to transform that speed into consistent jumping.</p>
        <p>She fouls often, and her results have varied wildly from meet to meet. Already Jones has lost four times in the event this season. At the Olympic trials in July, she nearly failed to qualify for the last three jumps of the competition, then won with her seasonal best of 23- 1/2. In contrast, Lewis needed only two of six allotted jumps on his way to winning four gold medals at the 1984 Summer Games, saving his body from the jolt of a hard landing.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to watch,'' Powell said of Jones's jumping. ''She should be jumping 24 feet consistently with her speed. Right now, it's a crapshoot with her at the Games. She's talented enough to jump 24 feet and win the gold. Carl didn't have to worry about the long jump. He knew he could win with one jump. With Marion, it's 'Am I going to qualify for the finals or win the gold?' ''</p>
        <p>This year, Jones has been much more accessible, giving numerous interviews, patiently answering the same questions again and again. She is smart and engaging, and she scored points for her Nike commercials, taking on such subjects as equal pay for women, increased violence committed by athletes, and the disparity in criticism of predominantly black athletes who leave school early to play professional basketball and football and predominantly white athletes who leave early to play baseball, hockey and tennis.</p>
        <p>Even with serious questions about the long jump at the Olympics, she has said repeatedly, she has no intention of taking home silver or bronze.</p>
        <p>''It has been many years since I dreamed about making my first Olympic team, and I wrote on my chalkboard that I wanted to be an Olympic champion,'' Jones said. ''Now that I am 24 and have the chance to do it, I'm not going to let it slip through my fingers.''</p>
