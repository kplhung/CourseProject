        <p>Very early in this college football season, a couple of things can be surmised. Wise voters in the national polls, as well as wise guys on bar stools, have learned that their safe picks at the top of the national rankings weren't so safe and that their smart picks weren't so smart.</p>
        <p>The Nos. 1 and 2 teams in the Associated Press poll, Nebraska and Florida State, were supposed to roll through the regular season, pass the occasional test on the schedule and arrive in the Orange Bowl for the national title game as the best two teams in the nation. They have flashy quarterbacks and five national championships between them in the 1990's. With offenses passed down through the generations with the surety the Rockefeller family handed down stock certificates, they essentially wrote the book on finishing No. 1. Right?</p>

        <p>Very early in this college football season, a couple of things can be surmised. Wise voters in the national polls, as well as wise guys on bar stools, have learned that their safe picks at the top of the national rankings weren't so safe and that their smart picks weren't so smart.</p>
        <p>The Nos. 1 and 2 teams in the Associated Press poll, Nebraska and Florida State, were supposed to roll through the regular season, pass the occasional test on the schedule and arrive in the Orange Bowl for the national title game as the best two teams in the nation. They have flashy quarterbacks and five national championships between them in the 1990's. With offenses passed down through the generations with the surety the Rockefeller family handed down stock certificates, they essentially wrote the book on finishing No. 1. Right?</p>
        <p>Well, on Saturday, Notre Dame almost corrected that Cornhuskers text before being upended in overtime, 27-24. Meanwhile, Georgia Tech's upset bid against the Seminoles was snuffed on fourth-and-3 on the Florida State 40-yard line on a pass play that officials could have ruled as interference. They didn't, and the Seminoles ran out the clock on a 26-21 victory.</p>
        <p>The smart choices to challenge for the championship?</p>
        <p>Let's see. Last week, Alabama (1-1) barely got out of the tunnel at the Rose Bowl before U.C.L.A. started sending the Crimson Tide plummeting from the preseason No. 3 ranking to No. 15. On Saturday, the Miami Hurricanes went west to Washington with a No. 4 ranking and flew back yesterday No. 12 after a 34-29 loss to the Huskies, who jumped six spots to No. 9. The overhyped Georgia Bulldogs stumbled 14 spots to No. 23 after South Carolina -- a team that just last week snapped a 21-game losing streak -- whipped them, 21-10.</p>
        <p>Neither Nebraska (2-0) nor Florida State (2-0) was punished for an uneven effort and they remained No. 1 and No. 2. But the coaches Frank Solich of Nebraska and Bobby Bowden of Florida State saw flaws that are substantial enough to make the road to Miami much more treacherous than expected.</p>
        <p>Notre Dame quarterback Arnaz Battle completed just three passes in a game in which he broke his left wrist, perhaps ending his season. Yet the Fighting Irish moved the ball well enough to force the overtime and to get to the Cornhuskers' 8-yard line on their first extra-time possession, and they settled for a field goal. Solich acknowledged that he was relieved to escape with a victory, especially after surviving a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by Julius Jones and an 83-yard punt return for a score by Joey Getherall.</p>
        <p>''It was a complete breakdown on special teams, and frankly we had been concerned about it since fall practice,'' Solich said.</p>
        <p>Bowden tried to sound confident after the Georgia Tech scare, though he didn't look it on the sideline, with his headphones on, talking to his coaches. In recent years, Bowden has asserted that most of his work goes into preparation; he delegates the heavy lifting to his assistants. ''Tech just would not quit,'' he said. ''What were our problems? Georgia Tech, they were our problems.''</p>
        <p>But the Seminoles were penalized 15 times for 114 yards, including a roughing-the-passer penalty with 4 minutes 50 seconds left. That gave Tech quarterback George Godsey a second chance, and he threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to set up the harrowing finish. Even the man who bailed the Seminoles out, the 28-year-old quarterback Chris Weinke, said Florida State would have to improve to repeat as national champion.</p>
        <p>''It's early in the season,'' he said after throwing for a career-high 443 yards and 2 touchdowns. ''I think we will be fine. This was a true test. But we need to get the killer instinct.''</p>
        <p>The dismal performances of Miami (1-1) and Georgia (1-1) should have been foreseen. In recent years, each program has followed preseason raves with ordinary performances. When will the Hurricanes learn that in order to swagger like Miami's great teams of the late 1980's, they have to play like them? They taunted the Huskies in the tunnel before the game, some players mimicking the Washington fans' penchant for barking like dogs. ''They came in here talking trash,'' Washington tight end Jerramy Stevens said. ''We came out and hit them in the mouth.''</p>
        <p>Last year, Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter often got on his receiving corps for dropping passes. Still, he passed on the National Football League draft, returned to school and was promptly touted as a Heisman Trophy candidate. His campaign took a major hit after he threw five interceptions against a South Carolina team that had not beaten a Southeastern Conference rival since Oct. 25, 1997, when the Gamecocks beat lowly Vanderbilt, 35-3.</p>
        <p>So which is the safe pick? Which is the smart pick? Several weeks from now, when the Bowl Championship Series ranking factors in all the computer data, the subjective polls and the strength of schedule, the field will narrow more. Don't toss out Nebraska and Florida State yet; two of the nation's best coaches should be able to shore up their teams' weaknesses.</p>
        <p>Wise voters and wise guys may want to look to the Midwest, where No. 3 Michigan and No. 4 Wisconsin -- both 2-0 -- are heading for a Sept. 30 showdown. The winner has an excellent chance of finishing the season undefeated, as does No. 8 Virginia Tech (2-0). The Hokies' toughest test is a Nov. 4 game with Miami, which hasn't beaten them since 1994.</p>
        <p>Then again, there's No. 5 Texas. Or. . . . In truth, there's neither a safe nor smart pick, only a starting point for an interesting college football conversation.</p>
