        <p>THIS WAS to have been the perfect Hollywood ending for the coming movie on the improbable life of Lance Armstrong. Brash young Texan rides his bike to the world road-racing championship; then miraculously survives testicular cancer that had spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain; then makes an amazing comeback and wins the Tour de France last year and again this year; then wins a gold medal in Sydney.</p>
        <p>Only the last scene is yet to unfold, and it may not happen. Two weeks ago, the 28-year-old Armstrong was on a training ride in the hills near Nice, France, when a car went out of control on a curve and hit Armstrong and a training partner, Tyler Hamilton. While Hamilton escaped with a few bumps, Armstrong sustained a broken vertebra in his neck. His training was interrupted, the pain did not leave and he skipped two European one-day races. He will decide this week whether he feels fit enough to ride in two Olympic races.</p>

        <p>THIS WAS to have been the perfect Hollywood ending for the coming movie on the improbable life of Lance Armstrong. Brash young Texan rides his bike to the world road-racing championship; then miraculously survives testicular cancer that had spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain; then makes an amazing comeback and wins the Tour de France last year and again this year; then wins a gold medal in Sydney.</p>
        <p>Only the last scene is yet to unfold, and it may not happen. Two weeks ago, the 28-year-old Armstrong was on a training ride in the hills near Nice, France, when a car went out of control on a curve and hit Armstrong and a training partner, Tyler Hamilton. While Hamilton escaped with a few bumps, Armstrong sustained a broken vertebra in his neck. His training was interrupted, the pain did not leave and he skipped two European one-day races. He will decide this week whether he feels fit enough to ride in two Olympic races.</p>
        <p>At the moment, he seems to be leaning toward not riding. He does not need the involvement because he has already raced in two Olympics. In 1992, as a 20-year-old amateur, he finished 14th in the road race. In 1996, as a pro and unknowingly racked with cancer, he placed sixth in the time trial and 12th in the road race.</p>
        <p>If he does ride, his best chance will be in the men's 29-mile time trial, in which the riders race one at a time against the clock. Armstrong won similar time trials in the last two Tours de France. With or without Armstrong in the race, Hamilton, from Marblehead, Mass., should be a medal contender.</p>
        <p>Three days before the time trial is the 148-mile road race, which will have such Tour de France rivals as Jan Ullrich of Germany, Alex Zulle of Switzerland and Mario Pantani of Italy. Because the essentially flat course is more suited to a sprinter, Armstrong has called that race a lottery. If he rides it, he will be a quarterback on the course, ad-libbing the strategy for the American five-man team and probably trying to set up a victory for George Hincapie of Greenville, S.C., or Fred Rodriguez of Piedmont, Calif.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- There will be 18 cycling events: 12 on the track, four on the road and two for mountain bikes. Eleven events are for men, seven for women.</p>
        <p>Track events will be contested on a steeply banked 250-meter indoor wooden track. The bikes will be flying perhaps 40 miles an hour at the end of the four-lap sprint, a tactical race that starts at a crawl, and the eight-lap keirin, in which a motorcycle sets the pace until the last two and a half laps. The mountain-bike races are cross-country, about 31 miles for men and 22 for women, with the average speed maybe 12 miles an hour. On the road, the women will cover 74.5 miles in the road race, 19.5 miles in the time trial.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- The strongest countries are Italy, the United States, Germany and Canada on the road; France, Australia, Germany and the United States on the track and France, Australia, Spain and Canada on mountain bikes.</p>
        <p>American medal contenders include Hamilton and Armstrong (if he races) in the men's road time trial; Marty Nothstein of Trexlertown, Pa., in the men's track sprint and keirin and Alison Dunlap of Colorado Springs in the women's mountain-bike race.</p>
