        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The large difference in the number of men and of women working in the technology sector could be affected by any of the causes cited in ''Technology's Gender Gap'' (editorial, Sept. 5). But the largest factor may be women's individual choices. It is likely that women are simply not as interested as men in working in the technology sector and thus choose other lines of work.</p>

        <p>Women are not so weak that they cannot get beyond less than ideal circumstances, like a lack of encouragement in school, to do what they really want to do. In most cases where men outnumber women, it's because women have made other choices.</p>
