        <p>FENCING ENDURES: it is only one of four sports to have been competed in each modern Summer Olympics dating to 1896. More popular in Europe than in the United States, fencing is ancient combat fought behind wire-mesh masks and bulletproof vests.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP There will be individual and team competitions for men in foil, epee and sabre, and women in foil and epee. There are 40 competitors in each individual discipline. Fencers are seeded by their current world ranking.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING In three three-minute rounds, the first fencer to reach 15 ''hits'' or touches wins. A tie is settled in a one-minute overtime. Points with the foil are scored with hits to the torso; with the epee, to any part of the body; with the sabre, to anywhere above the waist.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY Hit or be hit along a strip that is 14 meters long and 1.5 meters wide. Fencing is a sport of flashing weapons, moves and countermoves, lunges and parries, timing and distance, and quickly executed strategies. It is also polite: before and after each match, opponents must salute each other, the referee and audience.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES The American team is one of the strongest ever. Cliff Bayer (ranked No. 11 worldwide in men's foil) and Iris Zimmermann (No. 13 in women's foil) are legitimate medial hopefuls. The last United States medal was a bronze is 1984 for Peter Westbrook, who trained the team member Keeth Smart (sabre) and his sister, Erinn, (the foil alternate). But look for Laura Flessel-Colovic of France, the 1996 gold medalist, and Ildiko Mincza of Hungary women's epee; Valentina Vezzali of Italy, the silver medalist in women's foil in 1996; Ralf Bissdorf of Germany and Serge Goloubitsky of Ukraine in men's foil; and Arnd Schmitt of Germany and Pavel Kolobkov of Russia in men's epee. In men's sabre, Stanislav Pozdnyakov and Sergei Sharikov of Russian, who won the gold and silver medals in 1996, are the favorites.</p>
