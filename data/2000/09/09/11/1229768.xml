        <p>Following are excerpts from an interview today with Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman:</p>
        <p>MR. GORE -- ''We believe that this is a serious matter for our country, and we are delivering to the industry a six-month deadline to adopt voluntary standards and real enforcement mechanisms, and we're asking the various segments of the industry to adopt and enforce a voluntary uniform policy prohibiting the marketing of adult-rated products to children. . . .</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from an interview today with Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman:</p>
        <p>MR. GORE -- ''We believe that this is a serious matter for our country, and we are delivering to the industry a six-month deadline to adopt voluntary standards and real enforcement mechanisms, and we're asking the various segments of the industry to adopt and enforce a voluntary uniform policy prohibiting the marketing of adult-rated products to children. . . .</p>
        <p>''We want to say clearly that we expect that they will act on these findings and adopt these excellent recommendations, but if they do not clean up their act, we are prepared to support tougher measures to hold the industry accountable. . . . If necessary, we will support strengthening of the current laws that cover false and deceptive advertising, but of course all of our actions and proposals will be consistent with the First Amendment.''</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN -- ''The retailers have to be part of a solution to this problem. If the industry stops marketing adult-rated products to kids, that's a very significant step forward, but it's not going to solve the problem or end the problem unless retailers assume some responsibility, as Wal-Mart and Kmart did this last week. . . .''</p>
        <p>Q. How would you deal with multiplexes? Put guards in the theaters?</p>
        <p>MR. GORE -- ''That's clearly one possibility, but maybe there's a more cost-effective way to do it. I don't know, but they've got to do it.''</p>
        <p>Q. What happens after six months if they don't comply voluntarily?</p>
        <p>MR. GORE -- ''There are differing opinions within the F.T.C. legal staff as to whether or not the current authority allows them to proceed against false and deceptive advertising in this situation. So that would have to be tested. . . .''</p>
        <p>Q. Why is it deceptive?</p>
        <p>MR. GORE -- ''What makes the ad misleading is the context. If they are stating a policy to parents about their marketing practices and then, hidden from the parents' view in a teen magazine or in a teen chat room or on a Saturday morning program watched almost exclusively by children-- -- ''</p>
        <p>MR. LIEBERMAN -- '' ----or in an action toy---- ''</p>
        <p>MR. GORE -- '' ----or in an action toy, here is a marketing message aimed under the parents' radar directly to the children in direct opposition to what they have assured the parents that is, that makes that advertisement misleading.''</p>
        <p>Q. How do you control what a child sees on television?</p>
        <p>MR. GORE -- ''If a certain percentage of the audience is made up of kids, then you know you're over the line.''</p>
        <p>Q. What do you tell those financial contributors from the entertainment industry who obviously aren't going to be happy about this?</p>
        <p>MR. GORE -- ''Well, it's not as if this is a new conversation. It's a new part of an ongoing conversation. . . . ''If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I am going to do something about this. We're going to do something about this. Joe and I are deeply concerned about this. Tipper and Hadassah are as well, the American people are. There are ways to address this problem that give parents a hand. And I want to make the V-chip work, and I want these F.T.C. recommendations adopted immediately. I want to see more self-restraint in circumstances where young children can be harmed, and where families deserve the right to get more help in determining what their kids absorb.''</p>
