        <p>Stepping squarely into the New York race for Senate, the White House this weekend released an official photograph showing Rick A.

        <p>Stepping squarely into the New York race for Senate, the White House this weekend released an official photograph showing Rick A. Lazio, the Republican opponent to Hillary Rodham Clinton, enthusiastically shaking the hand of Yasir Arafat during an official visit to the Middle East nearly two years ago.</p>
        <p>The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said yesterday that he authorized the release of the photograph in response to a request from The New York Post, which featured it prominently in some copies yesterday. The photograph was distributed as a series of polls in New York showed Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio locked in a tight vote, with Jewish voters viewed by both sides as potentially crucial to the outcome.</p>
        <p>President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton will attend a dinner in Manhattan this evening sponsored by the World Jewish Congress, where the first lady is to be among those being honored.</p>
        <p>In explaining the decision to release a copy of the White House photograph, Clinton administration officials noted that Mr. Lazio had criticized the president for shaking hands with President Fidel Castro of Cuba last week at the United Nations Millennium Summit. They also noted that Mr. Lazio had repeatedly faulted Mrs. Clinton for kissing Mr. Arafat's wife, Suha, during a visit to Ramallah on the West Bank last year.</p>
        <p>''This wasn't a terribly difficult decision,'' Mr. Lockhart said. ''It seemed like a pretty straightforward issue to me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart said that the photograph was taken by an official photographer when Mr. Lazio joined a Congressional delegation and President Clinton on a trip to the Middle East at the end of 1998. He said he had clear memories of Mr. Lazio and other members of Congress meeting Mr. Arafat during a reception on the trip.</p>
        <p>In an article accompanying the photograph, The Post said it had asked the White House for the picture after being told of its existence by Representative Tom Lantos, a California Democrat, who was also on the Mideast trip. Mr. Lantos could be not reached for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio defended his handshake with Mr. Arafat, calling the Palestinian leader ''a person we're involved in peace negotiations with.''</p>
        <p>The candidate and his advisers criticized the White House, saying that it had intentionally released the photograph to disrupt Mr. Lazio's campaign, and that it was another example of President Clinton's aides using official resources to help Mrs. Clinton win her first bid for public office. Republicans have complained for more than a year that Mrs. Clinton has an unfair advantage in her campaign in the form of White House resources, particularly in her use of Air Force transportation.</p>
        <p>''Once again, taxpayer dollars are being used to further the Clinton campaign,'' Mr. Lazio said in Brooklyn during an unusually brief question-and-answer session with reporters yesterday. ''It's wrong.''</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Lazio's senior advisers, Mike Murphy, said, ''I wish the White House would spend more time trying to run the country and less time trying to help Hillary Clinton find a job.''</p>
        <p>The first lady, appearing at a service at the First Baptist Church of Crown Heights yesterday morning, would not say whether she thought the White House action was appropriate. ''You'll have to ask the White House about that,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton said that she had been aware of the photograph's existence, and she contended that it was relevant to voters who are judging her and Mr. Lazio as they compete to succeed Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat who is retiring.</p>
        <p>''I know about it, and I think that from the White House perspective, he attacked the president, as I understand what he said the other day,'' Mrs. Clinton said, alluding to Mr. Lazio's remarks about Mr. Castro. ''You know, we need to make sure that people in New York have all the information to cast an informed vote about what's in New York's best interest, and I think that someone who says one thing and does another -- consistently, as he has -- should be held accountable for that.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign aides clearly saw a significant political opportunity here. In her public schedule, reporters were instructed to arrive at the church, on Eastern Parkway, no later than 10:30, to be in their seats when services began then, presumably to avoid disturbing churchgoers. But when Mrs. Clinton arrived at 11 in the middle of the service, reporters and camera crews were summoned outside where Mrs. Clinton held a brief news conference devoted almost entirely to the subject of Mr. Lazio and Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>''It's the latest example of Rick Lazio saying one thing and doing another,'' she said. ''That describes his Congressional voting record, it describes his campaign. I've seen so many examples of it in the last month, so that people in New York need to know that there's a big difference between what he says and what he does.''</p>
        <p>After an appearance at the Great Irish Fair at Dreier-Offerman Park in Brooklyn, Mr. Lazio sought to draw a distinction between his handshake and Mrs. Clinton's embrace of Mrs. Arafat. ''It wasn't a kiss, it wasn't a hug and it wasn't a call for a Palestinian state,'' he said. ''And there is a world of difference between what Mrs. Clinton did and the reason I was there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said he had felt obligated to shake Mr. Arafat's hand because of the circumstances of their meeting. ''We were in the process of a receiving line with the president,'' he said. ''And the fact is we were there to witness the revocation of that part of the Palestinian charter that called for the destruction of Israel. There is a world of difference.''</p>
        <p>Photographers and video camera crews routinely follow President Clinton to all of his public -- and many of his private -- events to keep a historic record, and Mr. Clinton appears at the edge of the photograph of Mr. Lazio and Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>The White House routinely releases photographs of people with the president -- other politicians, ordinary citizens, journalists and others.  And, as in previous administrations,  it has been known to release photographs to advance its political purposes. A memorable example of this occurred after former House Speaker Newt Gingrich complained that he had been snubbed by President Clinton on the Air Force One flight to Israel for the funeral of Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin. The White House responded by releasing a photograph showing Mr. Gingrich in conversation with Mr. Clinton on the plane.</p>
        <p>On the flip side, the administration  has refused to put out photographs that did not serve its best interest. The White House routinely turns down requests from news organizations for photographs of fund-raising coffees Mr. Clinton has held in the White House.</p>
        <p>In any event, the photograph of him with Mr. Arafat provided a major distraction for Mr. Lazio, and clearly complicated his effort to draw Jewish voters. Assemblyman Dov Hikind, the Brooklyn Democrat who has been critical of Mrs. Clinton and has endorsed some Republicans in recent elections, said yesterday that he was ''shocked'' to see the photograph and predicted it would harm Mr. Lazio's standing among Jewish voters across the state.</p>
        <p>''It's just unbelievable when you look at this friendly embrace of Rick Lazio and Arafat,'' Mr. Hikind said. ''The issue becomes one of hypocrisy. Make sure that before you throw stones at someone, make sure everything is kosher with you.''</p>
