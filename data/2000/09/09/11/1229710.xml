        <p>THE AMERICAN and Australian teams -- with its stars Ian Thorpe, Susie O'Neill and Kieren Perkins -- will battle for the unofficial team title for most gold medals, although there are no engaging head-to-head matchups looming. Both countries are strongest in events where the other is weakest.</p>
        <p>High-tech bodysuits have also revolutionized the sport, creating a flurry of world records.</p>
        <p>THE WOMEN -- This sport, more than any other in the Olympics, has been tarnished for three decades by the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Smaller amounts of synthetic steroids have more effect in women than in men. All 32 medals won by East German women from 1968 to 1988 have been discredited by revelations in court and in documents of the former country's state-sponsored system of doping. About three dozen Chinese athletes were caught using banned substances in the 1990's. Michelle Smith of Ireland, who won three gold medals at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, was banned last year after testing positive for androstenedione, the steroid that Mark McGwire used the year he broke the home-run record, and for spiking a drug test with alcohol. Suspicion about possible drug use will be high at the Sydney Games as well.</p>
        <p>Skepticism attends two female swimmers: Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands, a respected but not previously great swimmer who set world records in the 50- and 100-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly this year, and the American Dara Torres, who qualified in three sprints at the Olympic trials after being away from the sport for seven years. Both swimmers have vehemently denied using illicit drugs, and both attribute their success to maturity, rigorous cross-training, better nutrition and the new bodysuits.</p>
        <p>At 33, Torres is the first American to participate in four Olympics. She has an entourage of a dozen specialists, including a swim coach, a nutritionist, flexibility experts, a mental coach and a specialist in massaging her lymph system.</p>
        <p>The American women are favored in only one event, the 800-meter freestyle, where Brooke Bennett is seeking to repeat as Olympic champion. Gold medals are possible in the sprints if Jenny Thompson and Torres can overcome de Bruijn. Thompson is tied with the speed-skater Bonnie Blair for most golds won by an American woman -- five -- but all of Thompson's victories have come in relays. She is seeking individual titles in Sydney in the 100 freestyle and 100 butterfly. One of the most fascinating races of the Games will be the 100-meter breaststroke, where Penny Heyns of South Africa will attempt to hold off the 16-year-old Megan Quann of the United States, who has said she will win and break the world record.</p>
        <p>THE MEN -- Thorpe will be a huge star if he wins, as expected, the 200- and 400-meter freestyle events. The 17-year-old Australian holds world records in both. Kieren Perkins of Australia is also looking to win his third consecutive Olympic title in the 1,500-meter freestyle. A great rivalry will be renewed in the 50-meter freestyle between Aleksandr Popov of Russia, the two-time Olympic champion, and Gary Hall Jr., the iconoclastic American who finished second in Atlanta. At the American Olympic trials, Hall swam faster in the 50-meter freestyle than Popov ever has in an eight-man race. A possible gold medalist is Anthony Ervin of the United States, who is the first swimmer of African-American descent to make the Olympic team. Popov will also seek to win his third Olympic title in the 100 freestyle, where Neil Walker of the United States and Hall will challenge for gold medals. Lenny Krayzelburg of Los Angeles, whose family immigrated from the former Soviet Union when he was 13 in 1989, is the world-record holder in the 100- and 200-meter backstroke, and should win both events in Sydney. Tom Malchow, who is 6 feet 7 inches, owns the world record in the 200-meter butterfly. Tom Dolan is back to defend his Olympic title in the 400-meter individual medley.</p>
        <p>SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING -- American and Canadian women dominated the first four Olympic competitions. Now the Russians, led by Maria Kisseleva, and Japanese are the favorites in the two events: the duet and the team. Kisseleva may be distracted by a positive drug test for ephedrine, which meant she had to give up her European duet crown.</p>
