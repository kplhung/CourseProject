        <p>THERE IS NO Robin Hood, no William Tell, not even Geena Davis, although the actress, a nationally ranked archer, promises to try again to make the 2004 United States Olympic team. There is no Justin Huish because the flamboyant Californian, a 1996 gold medalist, withdrew after a marijuana arrest. There are no complicated rules, either, just a matter of shooting arrows at a target 70 meters away.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- There are four events -- men's and women's individual and team. In the individual competition, after a round to seed them 1 to 64, the 64 men and 64 women have head-to-head eliminations. In the first three rounds, each archer shoots 18 arrows. In the last three, each shoots 12.</p>

        <p>THERE IS NO Robin Hood, no William Tell, not even Geena Davis, although the actress, a nationally ranked archer, promises to try again to make the 2004 United States Olympic team. There is no Justin Huish because the flamboyant Californian, a 1996 gold medalist, withdrew after a marijuana arrest. There are no complicated rules, either, just a matter of shooting arrows at a target 70 meters away.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- There are four events -- men's and women's individual and team. In the individual competition, after a round to seed them 1 to 64, the 64 men and 64 women have head-to-head eliminations. In the first three rounds, each archer shoots 18 arrows. In the last three, each shoots 12.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- The target is 4 feet in diameter, with a bull's-eye about 4 inches in diameter. A shot in the bull's-eye is worth 10 points, with lesser scores for the outer rings. The leading countries have three men or three women or both, and their scores are added to determine the team medalists.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- Each archer needs a shot or two to determine how strong the wind is and where it is coming from. A difficult crosswind in expected, so a perfect score in any round would be astonishing.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- The strongest nations are South Korea, Italy, Turkey, France and, as usual, the United States. Medal favorites include Michele Frangilli of Italy and Lionel Torres of France among the men, and Lee Eun Kyung of South Korea and Alison Williamson of Britain among the women. The American women expect a team medal.</p>
