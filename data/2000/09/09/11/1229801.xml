        <p>There have been few light moments during the battling in the case of the former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee, but in one climactic showdown last month a slight crinkle brightened the normally stolid visage of John Cline, one of the defense lawyers, as the government fought Dr. Lee's release on bail.

        <p>There have been few light moments during the battling in the case of the former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee, but in one climactic showdown last month a slight crinkle brightened the normally stolid visage of John Cline, one of the defense lawyers, as the government fought Dr. Lee's release on bail. A prosecutor was insisting that if Dr. Lee were placed in home detention, as the judge had proposed, every arriving package ought to be inspected, including flowers.</p>
        <p>''Flowers?'' asked the incredulous federal judge, James A. Parker, signaling with that one light volley that the defense had sealed an upset victory.</p>
        <p>It turned out to be one in a string of defense victories, but Mr. Cline's smirk was one of the few times that Dr. Lee's tiny, ad hoc and largely unpaid legal team allowed itself to exhibit a sense of triumph. There could now be many more, since the group recovered from a series of initial defeats to arrive at today's announcement of a plea agreement, having withstood the might of the federal government.</p>
        <p>So many important decisions broke for Dr. Lee before the plea deal, on issues like bail and racial profiling, that it is easy to forget what formidable odds his legal team first confronted.</p>
        <p>The group is led by Mark Holscher, 37, a sometimes emotional former assistant United States attorney who prosecuted Heidi Fleiss, known as the Hollywood Madam, and is now a partner in the elite corporate firm O'Melveny &amp; Myers of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The other pivotal members are Brian Sun, 46, a partner in a small Los Angeles litigation firm who represented several important donors in the Clinton administration's campaign-finance cases; Mr. Cline, 44, a self-effacing lawyer who was previously a partner with Williams &amp; Connolly in Washington, where he helped defend Oliver L. North; and Nancy Hollander, a partner of Mr. Cline's and a trial lawyer with civil rights experience.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most striking thing about this team is that it fell together serendipitously, beginning in March 1999, when Dr. Lee's daughter, Alberta, 26, essentially panicked.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lee recalled that she decided to defy her father and call a lawyer when he told her he had endured severe F.B.I. interrogations and was threatened with possible execution as a spy for China, an accusation he adamantly denied. She said she called a friend from her undergraduate days who was at Columbia University Law School, and the friend called a Columbia professor. The professor, according to Ms. Lee, contacted a friend who worked at O'Melveny &amp; Myers, and that led to Mr. Holscher.</p>
        <p>''I got involved initially just as a short-term favor,'' recalled Mr. Holscher, a conservative Republican who said he had no great interest in civil rights cases.</p>
        <p>When the case grew more serious, Mr. Holscher, aware of Dr. Lee's limited financial resources, agreed to work free. But he said the real fear among his partners was not loss of income but concern that other clients might be offended by his taking a client who had been reviled in some press reports as a spy.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Holscher and his associate, Richard E. Myers 2d, began spending hours on the case and quickly enlisted Mr. Cline and his firm, as well as Mr. Sun, who had worked as a prosecutor with Mr. Holscher and is a past president of the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Sun prepared a civil suit charging that the Department of Energy had violated Dr. Lee's privacy in disclosing personal information, he received free help from senior partners at Sidley &amp; Austin in Washington. Stacy Cohen, who had worked with Mr. Sun in the campaign finance cases, handled relations with the media.</p>
        <p>Only Mr. Cline and his firm, Freedman, Boyd, Daniels, Hollander, Goldberg &amp; Cline, of Albuquerque, are getting paid, but at a discount of about 30 percent and with a cap on the hours billed, Mr. Cline said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holscher estimated that the bill could have totaled more than $2 million without the donated and discounted services.</p>
        <p>''There are one-of-a-kind issues in this case,'' Mr. Holscher said. ''This is an extraordinary opportunity, and it's not a small thing that we've grown attached to Dr. Lee.''</p>
        <p>Charles Daniels, one of Mr. Cline's partners, added: ''This is what we went to law school for. There's an opportunity to correct an injustice. When the issue came up, we never even debated it.''</p>
