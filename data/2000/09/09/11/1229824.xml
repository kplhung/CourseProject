        <p>In another big change involving agencies working for DaimlerChrysler A. G., Springer &amp; Jacoby in Hamburg, the agency for Mercedes-Benz in Germany, has agreed to sell a minority interest to True North Communications in Chicago, which learned last week that its DaimlerChrysler Group accounts, including the Chrysler and Jeep brands, would be placed in review. Terms of the agreement, to be announced today, were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Springer &amp; Jacoby, the largest independent agency in Germany, is forming a new holding company in which True North will take an initial 35.5 percent stake, with an option to buy additional shares. The investment from True North will enable Springer &amp; Jacoby to expand across Europe and try to land additional Mercedes-Benz accounts, which are now divided among various agencies.</p>

The investment from True North will enable Springer &amp; Jacoby to expand across Europe and try to land additional Mercedes-Benz accounts, which are now divided among various agencies.</p>
        <p>Springer &amp; Jacoby had been in discussions to sell a minority stake to the Omnicom Group in New York, which owns Merkley Newman Harty, the Mercedes-Benz agency in the United States. An American campaign by Merkley Newman for the carmaker's redesigned C-class line begins appearing today. Omnicom is also part of the DaimlerChrysler review, with total billings estimated at $1.3 billion. Omnicom accounts in review include Dodge, handled by the Troy, Mich., office of BBDO Worldwide, and media planning and buying for Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep, handled by PentaCom in Troy.</p>
