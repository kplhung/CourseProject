        <p>WHEN OLYMPIC officials determined that professionals would be allowed to play baseball at the Sydney Games, there was talk of an American dream team, with visions of Ken Griffey Jr. and Mark McGwire swinging away. Wrong. September is for pennant races stateside.</p>
        <p>The next idea was for an older, less dreamy team of sorts -- Wade Boggs, Tim Raines and Chili Davis swinging out of retirement. Wrong again. When USA Baseball picked its team last month, the only prominent name was the manager, Tommy Lasorda. The rest were largely unknown minor leaguers.</p>

        <p>WHEN OLYMPIC officials determined that professionals would be allowed to play baseball at the Sydney Games, there was talk of an American dream team, with visions of Ken Griffey Jr. and Mark McGwire swinging away. Wrong. September is for pennant races stateside.</p>
        <p>The next idea was for an older, less dreamy team of sorts -- Wade Boggs, Tim Raines and Chili Davis swinging out of retirement. Wrong again. When USA Baseball picked its team last month, the only prominent name was the manager, Tommy Lasorda. The rest were largely unknown minor leaguers.</p>
        <p>Still, recognized professionalism will change the face of the competition. The Americans, Australians, Japanese and Koreans will now have strong clubs with lineups gleaned from their professional leagues, teams good enough to challenge Cuba, the longtime powerhouse. The open era in Olympic baseball may not have yielded a dream team, but it may foster baseball's most competitive, truly worldwide series.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- The designated hitter is used. Aluminum bats are now prohibited. There is a mercy rule: any team up by 10 or more runs after seven innings is declared the winner.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- Each of the eight teams plays every other team once. The top four advance to the semifinals. Winners meet in the final.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- Think about the 1980 United States Olympic hockey team with Lasorda as Coach Herb Brooks. That is the approach of the Americans, who, with an average roster age of 25, have decided to combat the experience of the dominant Cubans with youth.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- With every country, including Cuba, many of the biggest names are not going to Sydney. In the case of the Cuban team, there have been defections. Pat Borders, the former Toronto Blue Jays catcher, is the best-known American player. The Australians will be led by David Nilsson, an All-Star catcher for the Milwaukee Brewers last season. Japan is sending eight players from its major leagues. The Cuban third-baseman Omar Linares, long considered the best ''amateur'' player in baseball, returns for another Olympics. He will probably be the most-feared hitter here.</p>
