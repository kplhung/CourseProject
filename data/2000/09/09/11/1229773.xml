        <p>For New York's technology community, eager to extract itself from Silicon Valley's shadow, Friday's fund-raiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee at a penthouse loft in NoHo was a heady taste of power. Especially because Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate, brought her husband.</p>
        <p>About 150 people paid $1,000 to nibble on Thai duck pizza and schmooze with five senators, including Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia and Charles E. Schumer of New York. After the cocktail hour and remarks from President and Mrs. Clinton, 25 supporters who contributed $25,000 apiece had dinner with the Clintons and the senators. In all, about $750,000 was raised, campaign officials said.</p>

        <p>For New York's technology community, eager to extract itself from Silicon Valley's shadow, Friday's fund-raiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee at a penthouse loft in NoHo was a heady taste of power. Especially because Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate, brought her husband.</p>
        <p>About 150 people paid $1,000 to nibble on Thai duck pizza and schmooze with five senators, including Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia and Charles E. Schumer of New York. After the cocktail hour and remarks from President and Mrs. Clinton, 25 supporters who contributed $25,000 apiece had dinner with the Clintons and the senators. In all, about $750,000 was raised, campaign officials said.</p>
        <p>''For too long, the political establishment in Washington has looked to California when they think of technology,'' said Andrew Rasiej, chief executive of Digital Club Network and one of the event's organizers. ''Our motivation behind this was to send a definitive message that New York is ready, willing and able to enter into any dialogue on technology issues on a national scale.''</p>
        <p>The fund-raiser was led by the committee's High-Tech Council, which was formed earlier this year to establish closer ties between the Democratic senators and technology industry leaders. A trip to Silicon Valley by several senators last December raised $300,000, said David DiMartino, a committee spokesman. Subsequent visits with executives in Atlanta, Seattle, Chicago and now New York have garnered $3 million in this election cycle.</p>
        <p>The council is headed by Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, who also attended the New York event. About 200 technology executives who have contributed at least $25,000 each to the committee sit on the council and often serve as informal advisers to the senators. Most are from Silicon Valley.</p>
        <p>But several of those who attended the event on Friday night -- who included Jeffrey Dachis, chief executive of Razorfish; Kevin O'Connor, chairman of DoubleClick; and Rosalind Resnick, chief executive of NetCreations -- said they were determined to make New York's technology companies, known collectively as Silicon Alley, a more powerful presence.</p>
        <p>''It's nice to feel like we are finally able to exert some influence,'' said Gene DeRose, chief executive of Jupiter Communications, an Internet market research company.</p>
        <p>Others were underwhelmed: ''These senators just want to talk forever,'' said an executive of a Web site design company. ''I couldn't get away from that guy from Oregon.'' He was referring to Senator Ron Wyden.</p>
        <p>Some guests suggested that now that many Silicon Alley companies were financially capable of exerting political influence, they might need some lessons in how to wield it.  ''We need to come up with concrete ideas that can be acted on,'' said a supporter who declined to be identified. ''Some people here can't put two sentences together without either sounding arrogant or stupid.''</p>
