        <p>MAJOR IN Asia, minor throughout most of Europe and virtually invisible in the United States, badminton is a fast-twitch indoor feast of lunging gets and leaping smashes that bears only a vague resemblance to the dilettante's diversion.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- The game was developed in England in the 1860's by daughters of the Duke of Beaufort at his country seat, Badminton House, from whence it spread to the colonies, but it took well over a century for the quickest of all racket sports to reach the Olympics in 1992. Competition is single-elimination and held in men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles and, unlike in Olympic tennis, mixed doubles, too. Avoid calling the fine, feathered object hissing through the air a birdie. It is s a shuttlecock.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- Two of three games in all events. In men's singles and all doubles events, games are played to 15 points. In women's singles, games are played to 11. In all cases, points can only be scored by the serve. It gets tricky in the tie breakers. If the score is 13-13 in a game (9-9 in women's singles), the player who reached that total first can choose to extend the game by calling ''five,'' which means the first one to 18 or 14 wins. If the score is 14-14 (10-10 for those women's singles iconoclasts), the one who got there first can extend the game by calling ''three,'' which means exactly what you think it means.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- Shuttlers spend much of their time airborne in order to improve their hitting angles and generate leverage, but what makes badminton intriguing and an aesthetic delight are the rapid rhythm shifts: explosive smash and then silken dropshot.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- The badminton strongholds are Indonesia, Malaysia, China, South Korea and Denmark, which has produced the only two non-Asian Olympic medalists. Denmark's Peter Gade Christensen is a slight favorite in the men's singles in Sydney, but his countrywoman Camilla Martin should have a harder time with the Chinese women, led by Gong Zichao. Indonesia's Candra Wijaya and Tony Gunawan are an exceptional men's doubles team, while China's Gu Jun and Ge Fei are likely to defend their Olympic title in women's doubles.</p>
