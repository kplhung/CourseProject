        <p>The biggest Olympic stadium in history rises up all around you at Homebush Bay: 110,000 seats amid gentle sea breezes that can become gusts in the time it takes for a sprinter to lean forward and plant his splayed fingers and great expectations behind a thin white line.</p>
        <p>Cathy Freeman, one of Australia's most prominent athletes and its most prominent Aborigine, already knows the place well. She came here shortly after the stadium was finished in February 1999 with Nick Bideau, who was formerly her manager, boyfriend and mentor.

        <p>The biggest Olympic stadium in history rises up all around you at Homebush Bay: 110,000 seats amid gentle sea breezes that can become gusts in the time it takes for a sprinter to lean forward and plant his splayed fingers and great expectations behind a thin white line.</p>
        <p>Cathy Freeman, one of Australia's most prominent athletes and its most prominent Aborigine, already knows the place well. She came here shortly after the stadium was finished in February 1999 with Nick Bideau, who was formerly her manager, boyfriend and mentor. Bideau had already researched on which part of the new track the women's 400-meter race would begin at the Summer Olympics.</p>
        <p>''One lap as fast as you can,'' Bideau remembers saying, before setting her loose on a first training run at Homebush Bay. ''Right now there is nobody here, and when you come back there will be hundreds of cameras, tens of thousands of people but it won't change what you've got to do, and that's start here and finish here.''</p>
        <p>Off Freeman went in the silence, her long legs gobbling up meters of track and her heels nearly touching her buttocks at the end of each enormous and beautifully balanced stride. She has been running fast enough to win medals and generate headlines since she was 11 and newspaper reporters in her hometown of Mackay dubbed her ''wonder girl.'' A year before that, her stepfather Bruce Barber, a white railway guard with no track and field experience, sat on a log and watched her train and decided that she looked like a future Olympian.</p>
        <p>''That was the first time I ever heard anybody say to me that I could do it,'' Freeman said.</p>
        <p>She has now done it twice: first in 1992, when she failed to advance past the second round of the 400, and again in 1996, when she advanced past everyone except her much taller French measuring stick, Marie-Jose Perec, and ended up with the silver medal in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>But on the evening of Sept. 25, the date of the 400 final in Sydney, she will be -- barring injury -- the favorite: both on paper and in the hearts and minds of the Australian fans whose interest in and connection with Freeman made this the first session of track and field to sell out. Freeman has not lost a 400 in more than two years. She has won the last two world championships in the event, and she recorded the fastest time since 1998 last month in Monaco: 49.48 seconds.</p>
        <p>If she holds firm -- despite the pressure, despite the specter of the diminished but potentially still-dangerous Perec, and despite some painful recent distractions -- Freeman will become the first Aboriginal athlete to win an individual Olympic gold medal. And if she wins, she plans to reprise the victory celebration that helped make her reputation here by carrying both the Australian flag and the Aboriginal flag: just as she did after striking gold at the Commonwealth Games in 1994 and at the world championships in 1997.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a special time,'' she said recently, a touch of weariness in her voice. ''A once-in-a-lifetime experience, but you know what? It's just running. That's my coping strategy.''</p>
        <p>A Romance Ends, a Business Thrives</p>
        <p>Freeman, 27, has had much to cope with recently: first and foremost her acrimonious and litigious professional split in May with Bideau, the former Melbourne sports journalist and track and field specialist who wrote about Freeman's early exploits and began dating her in 1990 when he was 30 and she was 17.</p>
        <p>It was Bideau who persuaded Freeman to move far south to Melbourne from Brisbane, the capital of the Australian state of Queensland in northeastern Australia.</p>
        <p>It was Bideau, who in Pygmalionesque fashion, took control of her training, diet and career and helped her develop from a raw talent into a champion.</p>
        <p>Even after their romance ended in November 1996, he remained her manager for the next three and a half years. Both developed new relationships. Bideau became romantically involved with Sonia O'Sullivan, the Irish middle-distance runner and former world 5,000-meter champion. Their daughter, Ciara, was born in July last year.</p>
        <p>Two months later, Freeman married the American Sandy Bodecker, an executive with Nike, which happens to be her biggest sponsor. The wedding was less than a month after the world championships in Seville, Spain, where Freeman defended her 400 title and where Bodecker and Bideau argued publicly -- not for the first time -- about Freeman's pre-Olympic plans.</p>
        <p>According to an authorized 1999 biography of Freeman, ''A Journey Just Begun,'' Freeman had to intervene to put an end to that dispute. But while outsiders shook their heads in wonder at the continued intermingling of fractured relationships and shining goals, Freeman and Bideau continued working together under the umbrella of the Melbourne International Track Club, which Bideau and his business partner Peter Jess formed in the wake of Freeman's success.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to do a job that we know is bigger than both of us,'' Bideau said in February when asked how they managed to keep working together. ''What we're trying to achieve has a much more far-reaching effect than anything we can possibly do in our lives. If we can do that working together, and I can help her win it, that will affect so many people and will be remembered.''</p>
        <p>That same day in Melbourne, Freeman said, ''It was important for me to have Nick stay part of my sports group because he is so passionate. He's passionate about track and field and very good at understanding the sport and athletes and their needs.''</p>
        <p>But her words and actions were diverging. Later that month, Freeman reportedly offered Bideau a lump-sum settlement as part of a separation offer, one Bideau reportedly refused as far too low. In May, Freeman announced that she was severing ties with Bideau and the Melbourne track club, although she did retain the coach Peter Fortune, who had begun working with her at Bideau's suggestion in 1991.</p>
        <p>In June, Bideau and Jess retaliated by issuing a writ in the Victorian Supreme Court in Australia citing breach of contract and seeking damages on behalf of the Melbourne International Track Club and an injunction against anyone else managing Freeman. After a preliminary hearing, the two parties decided to postpone further action until after the Olympics in an attempt not to further disturb Freeman's preparations for the Games.</p>
        <p>Neither Freeman nor Bideau responded to interview requests last month to discuss the developments, but Freeman did say: ''I thought it was time to take a bit of control. I wanted to be in a position where I could do things for myself. From the time I was young, things were done for me, and I just let people do it for me. I didn't know anything different.''</p>
        <p>According to Fortune, the coach who is the link between a successful past and an uncertain future: ''The things that have happened surprised me, but not totally. There are personal issues, but I've just been impressed with the way she's picked it up and run with it. Things are certainly different now. She's much more self-determining. I think her motivation and focus have never been better.</p>
        <p>''She's working on a similar program to what she has done in the past, but the difference this year is that she's taking much more of a role in it herself, not so much in devising the program but in executing it and training at a high level. She's doing it without being in any way pushed, which maybe in the past was not the case.''</p>
        <p>But then, if Freeman cannot generate self-motivation with her own nation preparing to play host to the Games for the first time in 44 years, when will she ever be a self-starter?</p>
        <p>''Everybody's getting nervous; I'm getting nervous; I have to control my emotions,'' she said shortly before leaving her training base in Britain and returning to Australia after spending three months abroad, including a five-week stop at U.C.L.A. with the American coach John Smith and his group of feisty and talented sprinters.</p>
        <p>A Runner, an Australian, an Aborigine</p>
        <p>Freeman left Australia to avoid the crush of pre-Olympic attention and to find the best competition available. Australians have been watching her closely since she was 16, when, with only one year of serious training behind her, she ran a leg in the gold-medal-winning 4 x 100 relay at the 1990 Commonwealth Games. By 1997, a street had been named for her in Mackay and she had become, according to some national polls, the most admired woman in the country.</p>
        <p>But this month, the whole world will be watching her closely, and outsiders will be intrigued for much the same reason Australians were first intrigued: because of her ''Aboriginality.'' Indigenous Australians, who represent approximately 1 percent of Australia's population of 19 million, remain a distinctly underprivileged minority here, with markedly shorter life spans and markedly higher rates of child mortality, unemployment, alcoholism and criminality.</p>
        <p>The tattoo on Freeman's right shoulder might read ''Acosda I'm free,'' but her family has not escaped unscathed.</p>
        <p>Her father, Norman, was an accomplished rugby league player in North Queensland who later learned that he had diabetes, developed a drinking problem and separated from Freeman's mother in 1978 when Freeman was 5. He died at 53. Freeman's older sister Anne-Marie was born with cerebral palsy, spent most of her life in an institution and died of an acute asthma attack at 24.</p>
        <p>Freeman's maternal grandmother, Alice Mero, was one of thousands of Aboriginal children taken from their parents by Australian authorities in the first 60 years of the 20th century and handed over to foster parents or missions in an attempt to increase their chances of assimilating into mainstream Australian society. Aboriginal leaders have been pressing the current government for an apology for the treatment of what is now known in Australia as ''the stolen generation.''</p>
        <p>But the conservative government has refused, limiting itself to an expression of regret and sparking outrage in some segments of the Aboriginal community. Though seldom hesitant to discuss the plight of fellow Aborigines, Freeman has customarily been measured in her criticism, and she made it clear this year that she had no intention of heeding increasingly faint calls for an Olympic boycott or of using her celebrity as a political lever.</p>
        <p>She has indicated that she is interested in a career in politics when her athletic career finishes.</p>
        <p>''The time will come when I can be more instrumental in politics and national affairs, but not now,'' she said. ''I think I'm playing a big part just doing what I'm doing on the track.''</p>
        <p>This Time, Peaking on Her Own</p>
        <p>Freeman has never been a rock-steady performer, her weight and desire fluctuating with her moods. But she has made a habit of peaking for major events. She ran the fastest time of her career and sixth-fastest in history -- 48.63 seconds -- in the last Olympic final. The difference in Sydney is that Bideau will no longer be there to help her peak; no longer there to harken back to the hard work gone by with the words, ''One lap as fast as you can.''</p>
        <p>This time, it will be up to Freeman, and if she can do it amid the din, she knows she will feel a great deal more emotion than she felt after defending her world title last year and slumping wearily to the track without bothering with a victory lap as if already feeling the weight of a nation's Olympic expectations.</p>
        <p>''I was already thinking about Sydney,'' she said. ''A world title gold medal is not my dream. An Olympic gold medal is.''</p>
