        <p>Hewlett-Packard is in negotiations to acquire the consulting unit of PricewaterhouseCoopers for as much as $20 billion, executives close to the talks said yesterday.</p>
        <p>These executives cautioned that the talks were at a delicate stage and could still break down.</p>
        <p>If reached, the deal would reshape Hewlett-Packard into a full-service computer hardware manufacturer and consulting services company, mimicking the successful business model of I.B.M., which was developed by its chairman and chief executive, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., himself a former consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>For PricewaterhouseCoopers, the sale would finally sever its consulting arm from its accounting business, a relationship that the Securities and Exchange Commission had questioned as too close because of the potential for conflict of interest between the auditing and consulting units. Just last month, the commission said it was investigating whether PricewaterhouseCoopers acted improperly in auditing the books of a real estate investment trust while it was helping the firm complete a number of acquisitions.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers said, ''We don't comment on rumors.'' A spokesman for Hewlett-Packard could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which is representing PricewaterhouseCoopers, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Executives close to the negotiations said PricewaterhouseCoopers had also held preliminary talks with General Electric, Siemens of Germany, Microsoft and I.B.M., among others, but Hewlett-Packard had emerged as the most serious partner.</p>
        <p>The deal would come after a rash of similar separations of auditing and consulting units at other firms. In early August, Andersen Consulting separated from its parent company, Arthur Andersen, the world's largest accounting firm, after protracted arbitration. In February, Ernst &amp; Young sold its consulting business to Cap Gemini of France for $11.1 billion.</p>
        <p>The deal would be subject to approval by PricewaterhouseCoopers' more than 10,000 partners as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the case of Ernst &amp; Young's sale of its consulting unit to Cap Gemini, it agreed to fully divest its stake within five years.</p>
        <p>Like most of its competitors, Hewlett-Packard has been seeking to increase its consulting services business, which is a considerably higher margin business than selling computer hardware.</p>
        <p>Last year, Cisco Systems acknowledged the importance of the consulting world, taking a $1 billion stake in KPMG Consulting. The consulting group has specialized in providing what it calls ''e-business services'' to a client list that includes blue-chip companies and the Pentagon, the State Department and Yale University. And this summer, Hewlett-Packard formed its own alliance with Cisco to offer consulting services to enterprise and service-provider customers. Sun Microsystems also has its own consulting arm.</p>
        <p>Traditional computer companies like Hewlett-Packard are hoping that by expanding their business to include consulting, they will gain long-term servicing contracts to manage the implementation and integration of their hardware and software.</p>
        <p>Consulting is also increasingly more lucrative than accounting, especially as consultants, many from auditing firms, design and install large management information services.</p>
        <p>Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., has expressed concern over the perception that auditor independence has been hindered by consulting services offered by the same firm. While accounting firms are already prohibited from offering some of those services, the S.E.C. is proposing to bar companies from using the same firm to provide both internal and outside audits and using a firm that provides information services consulting to them as their auditor.</p>
