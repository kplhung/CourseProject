        <p>THIS HAS always been a strong Olympic sport for the United States, which has won 69 individual medals, 30 gold. The Americans are solid again with shotguns (skeet and trap), where for the first time men and women have separate competitions. When women competed against men, they sometimes won.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- There are 17 medal events: six shotgun, five rifle, five pistol and one in running target with an air rifle. Seven events are for women only.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- The shooters get 75 to 150 shots in the shotgun events, 40 to 120 with rifle and pistol and 60 in running target. The rifle shooting is at 10 or 50 meters, the running target at 10 meters and pistol at 10, 25 or 50 meters. In skeet and trap, points are awarded for hitting flying targets. In the other events, the idea is to hit the bull's-eye.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- It begins with finding a federation or private sponsor because competition rifles and pistols can cost as much as $7,000 or $8,000, shotguns as much as $10,000 to $12,000. Almost half of the United States team, including all five male riflemen, are members of the armed forces.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- Most of the best shooters come from Europe and Asia. One to watch is Tavarit Majchacheep of Thailand, who in January set a world record for air rifle at 10 meters with a perfect score of 600: 60 shots, all down the middle. Two good Americans are Bill Demarest of Mission Viejo, Calif., in men's free pistol and Kim Rhode of El Monte, Calif., a 1996 medalist in the women's double trap.</p>
