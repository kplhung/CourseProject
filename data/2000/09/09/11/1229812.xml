        <p>Seven people were being held yesterday on drug and weapons charges after police raids in Bushwick, Brooklyn, that resulted from an undercover investigation into one of the few surviving factions of the Latin Kings gang, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Assistant Chief Charles Kammerdener, commander of the Police Department's narcotics division, said the raids had effectively neutralized a Latin Kings cell known as the Gangster Killer Kings.</p>
        <p>The police said the group, led by Carlos Perez, 33, and Pedro Mendez, 32, offered a smorgasbord of guns and drugs from apartments guarded by 17 pit bulls. The police estimated that the group sold $15,000 worth of marijuana, powder cocaine, heroin, crack and other drugs every day.</p>
        <p>Chief Kammerdener said that throughout the summer, undercover detectives bought guns from the gang, including some of the most deadly models available.</p>
        <p>Among the purchases were three .357 Magnum revolvers, two 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistols, a .44 Magnum pistol with an eight-inch barrel and another with a telescopic sight, and a Chinese-made AK-47 infantry assault rifle that came with 196 rounds of ammunition.</p>
        <p>The detectives seized or purchased 16 guns in all, along with hundreds of rounds of ammunition.</p>
        <p>''We believe that this is going to have a significant impact on the reduction of shootings and violence in the 83rd Precinct,'' Chief Kammerdener said.</p>
        <p>The Latin Kings have been in decline since a crippling federal and city raid in 1998 that rounded up more than 100 gang members and their associates, the authorities said, but a few small pockets of the gang have persisted, including the group held in custody yesterday.</p>
        <p>The police said the arrests did not signal a resurgence of the gang, but were more of a mopping up of remnants who had continued in crime. Those in custody yesterday ranged in age from 25 to 46.</p>
        <p>''These are small tribes or factions of this gang,'' Chief Kammerdener said. ''Certainly, this is a group of members of one faction that aren't going to be around anymore.''</p>
        <p>Although the Gangster Killer Kings took steps to protect themselves, they were ultimately undone, the police said, by detectives from the Firearms Investigation Unit, who posed as buyers and gradually built a case.</p>
        <p>During the summer, the detectives paid from $400 for a .25-caliber pistol to $1,000 for the AK-47, the police said, and patiently waited until they had enough evidence for multiple felony charges before seeking warrants and raiding the apartments.</p>
        <p>They also bought drugs, including a few ounces of cocaine, in both its powdered and crack forms, and 402 packets of heroin.</p>
        <p>The raids took place throughout the day on Saturday, but were not announced until yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Perez and Mr. Mendez, both of 179 Jefferson Street, the police arrested Bienvenido Perez, 46, and his son Juan Perez, 25, both of 249 Melrose Street; Orlando Rodriguez, 31, of 1378 Bushwick Avenue; Diana Corchado, 27, also of 179 Jefferson Street; and David Jones, 26, of 1685 Norman Street in Queens.</p>
        <p>Joe Swart, an assistant district attorney assigned to Brooklyn's Major Narcotics Investigation Bureau, said all seven were held yesterday pending arraignment this morning in Brooklyn Criminal Court.</p>
        <p>The final charges had not been drafted yesterday, Mr. Swart said, but would include multiple counts of criminal sale of weapons and criminal sale of controlled substances against each defendant, and drug and weapon possession charges against some of the gang members.</p>
        <p>Five of the seven defendants have criminal records, the police said; only Mr. Jones and Juan Perez had not been arrested before. The authorities also said that the reputed ringleaders, Mr. Mendez and Mr. Perez, had been arrested a total of 15 times on charges including assault, drug sales, endangerment and robbery.</p>
        <p>Chief Kammerdener said that in addition to trafficking in drugs, the gang members might have been accomplished burglars, because many of the guns that detectives bought were freshly stolen. For instance, 11 of the 15 guns that the police bought were stolen in June from a single residence in Queens, and two were sold to detectives within five days of being reported missing by their owner. Another pistol was reported stolen from New Jersey in 1996.</p>
