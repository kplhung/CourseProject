        <p>AS the final seconds of the Giants' 33-18 stampede flashed away yesterday, their general manager, Ernie Accorsi, stared at the Veterans Stadium message board with the out-of-town scores.</p>
        <p>''How about the Colts losing to the Raiders,'' he said, even before the Redskins were also upset by the Lions. ''It's such a volatile league.''</p>
        <p>That's volatile, as in unpredictable, as in parity. (Or is it parody?) After the season openers, the Eagles were the talk of the National Football League for having routed the Cowboys, 41-14, as Duce Staley rushed for 201 yards. But yesterday the Giants' defense, as if by magic, made Staley and the Eagles' offense disappear.</p>
        <p>In each of the Eagles' first three possessions, they were three-and-out for a total of only 10 yards, 6 for Staley. By then the now first-place Giants were up, 6-0, and on their way to the first 2-0 start in Jim Fassel's four seasons as their coach.</p>
        <p>For all the yardage rolled up by quarterback Kerry Collins and running back Tiki Barber, the Giants defense established the tone by stuffing Staley early.</p>
        <p>The defense then forced the Eagles, who had a first down at the Giants' 4-yard line on their fourth possession, to settle for a field goal after linebacker Ryan Phillips's 12-yard sack of Donovan McNabb.</p>
        <p>''Had they scored there,'' defensive end Michael Strahan said, ''the whole momentum would've changed.''</p>
        <p>Instead, the Giants rolled to a 27-6 lead. Staley finished with 11 yards on 7 carries (plus 58 on 7 receptions) as well as with a damaged quadriceps muscle that needed treatment.</p>
        <p>''Duce is the catalyst of their offense,'' Strahan said. ''You always expect him to break a big play, but our guys covered every gap. We made the run obsolete.''</p>
        <p>The Giants' disciplined defense also made you wonder just how bad the Cowboys' defense must be for Staley to have run wild.</p>
        <p>The Giants' defense also showed what a difference a year makes, at least in the second game of the season. After opening with a 17-13 victory at Tampa Bay a year ago, the Giants were embarrassed by the Redskins, 50-21, at Giants Stadium -- an ominous hint of their eventual 7-9 record.</p>
        <p>But even with a 2-0 start and another victory looming next Sunday in Chicago against the battered Bears (now 0-2 after yesterday's 41-0 thumping by Tampa Bay), it's too early for any Giants parishioners to make reservations in Tampa, Fla., for Super Bowl XXXV on Jan. 28.</p>
        <p>Nobody will know if the Giants are really a playoff contender until after their fourth and fifth games -- against the Redskins on Sunday night, Sept. 24, at Giants Stadium, followed by an Oct. 1 visit to Tennessee.</p>
        <p>The Giants, whose offensive line lacks depth, have also not had a serious injury and, as everyone in pro football knows, the road to the Super Bowl and the playoffs for every team goes through its X-ray room.</p>
        <p>But these Giants have something that Fassel's other teams never had -- a quarterback who doesn't have to look over his shoulder, a quarterback who is in charge, a quarterback who is not a temp until somebody better comes along.</p>
        <p>During each of Fassel's three previous seasons, he had to change quarterbacks: from Dave Brown to Danny Kanell in 1997, from Kanell to Kent Graham in 1998, from Graham to Collins a year ago. But barring injury, Collins is the quarterback.</p>
        <p>''Kerry took the job by the horns,'' linebacker Jesse Armstead said, ''and now you've got to rally behind him. He distinguished himself from the other quarterbacks that were here.''</p>
        <p>Collins was virtually flawless, completing 21 of 29 passes for 220 yards and 2 touchdowns. Barber hurried for 96 rushing yards, including a 31-yard touchdown. Ike Hilliard caught 8 passes for 84 yards, including a 30-yard touchdown, and Amani Toomer caught 7 for 80 yards, including a 25-yard touchdown. That's spreading the wealth.</p>
        <p>But if the defense hadn't stuffed Staley early, Fassel could have been haunted by penalties that stalled the offense when the game was still up for grabs -- right tackle Luke Petitgout's illegal motion, left tackle Lomas Brown's false start. Against a better team, those penalties will surely be more costly than they were yesterday.</p>
        <p>As for the Eagles, after their rout of the Cowboys, they had credited pickle juice, with its salt and vinegar, for helping to prevent cramps and dehydration in Dallas's brutal heat. It made for a nice story, and in yesterday's humid 77-degree heat, one Vet banner toasted ''Pickle Power'' and another boasted, ''We're Pickled to Death.''</p>
        <p>Against the Giants, the Eagles needed more than pickle juice. They needed an offense, but the Giants defense had made it disappear.</p>
