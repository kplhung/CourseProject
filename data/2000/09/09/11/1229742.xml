        <p>The announcement last week that Shockwave.com, one of the most frequently visited entertainment sites on the World Wide Web, was laying off 15 percent of its staff and shifting its emphasis toward more interactive diversions, was bad enough. But coming just days after Pop.com, the dot-com brainchild of some of Hollywood's most famous names, announced it was shutting down before it ever opened for business, many in this new, once-growing Internet sector are beginning to wonder if the party is over before it has really had a chance to begin.</p>
        <p>The announcements are resurrecting concerns that further failures and cutbacks are inevitable in the online entertainment sector, which has exploded since 1999.</p>
        <p>Many of those in the field say they have learned at least two important lessons over the last, tumultuous year. First, it is difficult, if not impossible, to sell enough online advertising to defray the unexpectedly high costs of producing and maintaining an entertainment-only site, particularly if that site has no other source of revenue. And second, as might have been expected, Web surfers turn out to be more interested in entertainment that exploits the medium's inherent interactivity, like games and virtual communities, than in traditional, old-style films and animation that can be more easily and pleasantly viewed on television.</p>
        <p>''In my view, the Web is not about repurposing content that works in other media,'' said Lawrence Levy, Shockwave's chairman. ''It's about leveraging the powers of this medium, and that's what we're focusing on now. To me, the fact that we are having this kind of shakeout is no surprise at all.''</p>
        <p>Eighteen months ago, there were only a handful of Web sites dedicated to providing entertainment, usually in the form of streams of live-action or animated shorts. But the numbers grew exponentially until, earlier this year, there were more than 100 sites, with new ones being introduced every week.</p>
        <p>As home computers became faster, and software breakthroughs allowed increasingly sophisticated audio and video to be delivered through telephone and cable modems, many believed that a new entertainment medium was emerging, and there was a rush to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>
        <p>The first sign of trouble came with the collapse last spring of the Digital Entertainment Network, one of the earliest and most profligate of the entertainment sites. Its failure was quickly followed by widespread predictions of a further winnowing of financially vulnerable sites. Sure enough, as some of the dot-com start-ups depleted their initial financing and found it harder to raise more money, there was a steady dribble of layoffs and retrenchments throughout the spring and summer.</p>
        <p>''The market has changed quite a bit since April, when you could get things funded on the back of a napkin,'' said Matt Hulett, chief marketing and online officer at AtomFilms, a Web site owned by the Atom Corporation that has thus far escaped the woes that have plagued others in the field. ''We're almost the grandfather of whatever you want to call this space, at least in Internet dog years. But then, we never really considered ourselves a dot-com. The Web is just one channel for us.''</p>
        <p>Those companies whose business models called for offering Web entertainment supported only by online advertising are finding that this is not a viable strategy, Mr. Hulett and others said last week. The companies that are still hanging in there, and still have hopes of prospering, are those that figure out ways of making money beyond advertising. AtomFilms, for instance, also sells its short films to airlines, cable television channels, shopping malls and other outlets. WireBreak Entertainment has focused more attention on creative interactive entertainment for others' Web sites, including commercial sites that are looking for ways to keep shoppers shopping. Others are relying on popular, globally known brands. Stan Lee Media uses the name and work of the legendary comic-book creator to attract fans to his new comic creations on the Web, which are also spun out into books and comics and other more traditional outlets.</p>
        <p>''After all of this, in the new world order, the companies that have multiple revenue streams and both online and offline distribution strategies, those people will have real businesses,'' Mr. Hulett said.</p>
        <p>Shockwave, whose media players and animation software are crucial to many Web applications, was hoping to use the traffic that this drove to their site to build its own entertainment destination, and the first months of this year were filled with a stream of announcements of new deals to create animation for the site by some of the top names in Hollywood, including Tim Burton, James L. Brooks and the creators of ''South Park,'' Trey Parker and Matt Stone.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Levy of Shockwave said last week, a fresh approach is needed. The company, a unit of Macromedia, will lay off 20 people at its offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles, but that is just the start. ''We have been dissecting this business from top to bottom to understand how to take our assets and turn this into a real, viable entertainment business over the next 12 to 18 months,'' Mr. Levy said.</p>
        <p>While Shockwave will continue with the deals it has already announced with Hollywood filmmakers, there will be no more of them, Mr. Levy said, at least not anytime soon. ''Our pipeline for those kind of deals is full now, so we will execute those and see how it works,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Instead, the company plans to focus more energetically on creating entertainment that is truly interactive, including games, music and other ''interactive creativity applications,'' Mr. Levy said. It will be several months before visitors to the site notice the changes, he said, and they will probably be introduced gradually and without fanfare. ''It might not be a big hit over the head,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Pop.com's announcement last week was more apocalyptic.</p>
        <p>The long-delayed Web site, which was unveiled amid great fanfare last year, laid off all but about a dozen of its 75 employees last week, just weeks before the site was to begin operation. Much of the attention that the site has drawn has been due to the names of its principal backers, which include DreamWorks, the Hollywood studio co-founded by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, and the founders of Imagine Entertainment, the movie director Ron Howard and the producer Brian Grazer.</p>
        <p>Initially, Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Howard and the others promised to deliver fresh, short pieces of entertainment by some of the biggest names in Hollywood, and Mr. Katzenberg and Mr. Grazer said that they felt they had fresh ideas about how to use advertising in creative ways to support the site. With a promise of up to $50 million in financing from the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, the site was to be up and running by last spring.</p>
        <p>But months passed without any clear indication of when the site would be started, and reports surfaced in recent weeks that its founders were eagerly looking for someone, perhaps another entertainment dot-com, to merge with them. But it was not until a final attempt to merge with another dot-com, Ifilm, fell through that Pop.com's founders decided it was wiser to unplug than to plunge ahead.</p>
        <p>''We did it the same way everybody did it,'' Mr. Katzenberg said last week. ''We just called uncle first.''</p>
        <p>The company had spent about $7 million, largely on its staff and on creating a first round of pieces for the site. Then, its principals had to decide last weekend whether to go ahead and start the site -- which they concluded would cost $2 million to 2.5 million a month to keep in operation -- or pull back. They opted for caution, Mr. Katzenberg said, because they had discovered there was no way they could sell enough advertising to turn a profit.</p>
        <p>Still, a staff of about a dozen will continue experimenting with Web-based entertainment and supporting a celebrity fan site that Pop.com acquired earlier this year, with a budget of about $1 million a year. If someone else figures out a way to make money with entertainment on the Web, Pop.com might possibly be resurrected.</p>
        <p>''Who knows if there's even a business there?'' Mr. Geffen said. ''Nobody knows.''</p>
