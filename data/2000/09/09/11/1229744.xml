        <p>The Schwann catalog, for more than 50 years the primary consumer listing of classical, jazz and pop recordings, is replacing its quarterly Opus (classical) and Spectrum (pop) catalogs with annual issues, supplemented by both a constantly updated Web site and a monthly magazine, Schwann Inside.</p>
        <p>The September debut issue of Schwann Inside, published last month, includes listings, record reviews and performer profiles. The Web site, www.schwann.com, is currently available only to libraries but will go public next month. Users will be asked to pay an annual subscription fee of $99.</p>
        <p>''One of the reasons we're doing this,'' said Ali Crawford, the assistant publisher of Schwann Publications, ''is that new releases come out so frequently that a quarterly catalog wasn't timely enough. Also, the Schwann Opus quarterly was exceeding 1,200 pages. Over the years we've tried all sorts of tricks, abbreviating record label names, changing fonts, abbreviating instruments. But the size of the catalog made it very costly to print.''</p>
        <p>The Schwann was for many years a monthly publication, printed in a format slightly larger than a paperback book and running about 250 pages. When it became a quarterly, in the late 1980's, it was also expanded to a standard magazine format, and was about one and a half inches thick. The classical edition, Opus, was a standard resource for record collectors but was plagued by the vagaries of the record business, particularly in recent years, when discs have quickly gone out of print or been shifted by their labels from one series to another, with different catalog numbers and list prices.</p>
        <p>The online version of Schwann should address the problem of keeping information up-to-date and provide a great deal more of it than could be included in the printed Schwann.</p>
        <p>''All these years, Schwann collected 100 fields of information,'' Ms. Crawford said, referring to categories in the company's database. ''But in the printed catalog, there was room for only 10. So the printed version would include the composer's name, the title of the piece, the principal performers, the label and catalog number, and the price. But the database also includes the recording dates and locations, all the performers and their instruments -- basically, anything you'd want to know about a recording.''</p>
        <p>Schwann Opus typically sold about 15,000 copies, Ms. Crawford said, split evenly among subscribers, libraries and sales at large record stores like Tower, HMV and Virgin. Schwann Artist, an annual version of Schwann Opus with the listings sorted by performer rather than composer, sold about 21,000 copies, and Schwann Spectrum, the quarterly pop catalog, sold 21,000 copies. Ms. Crawford declined to estimate the potential readership for the Web site version but said that the company had received numerous calls in recent years requesting an electronic version of the catalog, either online or on disc.</p>
        <p>The move to the Web effectively renders all the print versions of the catalog -- the annuals as well as the listings in the new magazine -- rather unwieldy. When the Schwann was published monthly, it included both new releases and back catalog; Schwann Inside lists only recent recordings, so a collector looking for, say, a recent recording of a Beethoven Piano Concerto would have to search all the issues published between the annuals. And given the frequency with which record companies add, delete and reconfigure their recordings, the annual is bound to be almost instantly obsolete.</p>
        <p>''That may be,'' Ms. Crawford said. ''But the printed versions will still have interviews and features that won't be available online, although we're exploring ways of having other kinds of online content. And also, we get calls from researchers who ask us if we still have catalogs from the 1950's or 60's, because they want to see what was available at the time. That's the fun thing about archiving these catalogs. The printed versions give you a real snapshot of history. That's something you don't get in a constantly updated catalog online.''</p>
