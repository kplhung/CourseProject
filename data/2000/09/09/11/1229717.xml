        <p>SHE IS 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighs 300 pounds and is only 17 years old. Her combination of strength, flexibility and explosiveness also makes Cheryl Haworth the United States's best chance for a women's medal as the sport makes its Olympic debut for the female lifters.</p>
        <p>But men's weight lifting was included in the first modern Olympics in 1896 and has been a part of every Games since then except for 1900, 1908 and 1920.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- The snatch is the first of the two lifts. The bar is placed horizontally in front of the lifter's legs. It is gripped palms-downward and pulled in a single movement from the ground to the full extension of both arms above the head. In order to be considered a successful lift, the weight must be maintained in the final, motionless position -- arms and legs extended, with the feet on the same line -- until the referees give the down signal.</p>
        <p>The second of the two lifts, the clean and jerk, is executed in two stages. In the first part, the clean, the bar is placed horizontally in front of the lifter's legs. It is gripped palms-downward and pulled in a single movement from the ground to the shoulders while bending the legs.</p>
        <p>In the second part, the jerk, the athlete bends the legs and extends them, as well as the arms, so as to bring the bar to the full stretch of the arms, vertically extended. He returns the feet to the same line -- arms and legs extended --  and waits for the referees' signal to replace the bar on the platform.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- If Haworth is hoping to make history, so, too, is Naim Suleymanoglu. Nicknamed ''Pocket Hercules,'' Turkey's 5-foot featherweight is trying to become the first weight lifter to win gold in four successive Olympics.</p>
        <p>Having come out of retirement last year, Suleymanoglu, now 33, is currently ranked fourth in the world.</p>
        <p>Halil Mutlu of Turkey, who won the gold medal in the 56kg division in the Atlanta Games, has dominated his competition and is expected to defend his title.</p>
