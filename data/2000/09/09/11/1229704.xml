        <p>Intuit, a supplier of tax and business management software, plans to announce today that it is starting an electronic marketplace for the small-business owners who use Intuit's QuickBooks software. The marketplace would offer special deals on computers and office supplies and make it easier to for users to do business online with other small companies that use the software.</p>
        <p>With the announcement, Intuit, based in Mountain View, Calif., would join a long list of electronic marketplaces that have appeared lately, although most of those have  been within specific industries, including automotive and utilities. The QuickBooks Shopping Source, as the e-marketplace will be called, will be an option available to any company that uses QuickBooks software.</p>

        <p>Intuit, a supplier of tax and business management software, plans to announce today that it is starting an electronic marketplace for the small-business owners who use Intuit's QuickBooks software. The marketplace would offer special deals on computers and office supplies and make it easier to for users to do business online with other small companies that use the software.</p>
        <p>With the announcement, Intuit, based in Mountain View, Calif., would join a long list of electronic marketplaces that have appeared lately, although most of those have  been within specific industries, including automotive and utilities. The QuickBooks Shopping Source, as the e-marketplace will be called, will be an option available to any company that uses QuickBooks software.</p>
        <p>Intuit, whose flagship product is the Quicken tax-preparation program, estimates that about three million small businesses use its QuickBooks business management program, each spending an average of 10 hours a week with the software. If even a portion of those customers use the Shopping Source, Intuit hopes, it could become a sizable electronic marketplace.</p>
        <p>Using their collective influence as buyers, Shopping Source users will be able to get special deals on office products from Office Depot and Daytimers, among others. Even janitorial services can be contracted through the site.</p>
        <p>According to Intuit's research, QuickBooks users spend a total of $500 billion a year on business products and services, and 62 percent of them already use the Internet to shop. Online purchases by small businesses are forecast to hit $118 billion by next year.</p>
        <p>But even Intuit acknowledges that electronic marketplaces are no sure thing. Already, many of the marketplaces that sprang up in the last few years are faltering and investors are becoming wary. In some industries, it appears that traditional forms of bartering and buying products and services are still dominant. But Intuit says that small businesses may prove a more successful clientele.</p>
        <p>To create and manage the site, Intuit has hired Metiom, a New York-based company that has built electronic commerce sites for First Union Bank, Chase Manhattan and others. The company, which until last week was called Intelisys Electronic Commerce, was founded in 1996.</p>
        <p>Last year, Metiom disclosed that the investment firm Forstmann Little &amp; Company had bought a 33 percent stake, worth about $65 million. At that time, Erskine Bowles, a Forstmann partner and former White House chief of staff for President Clinton, became chairman of Metiom's  board.</p>
