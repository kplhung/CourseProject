        <p>The situation called for something spectacular, which meant the situation was perfect for Tiger Woods.</p>
        <p>Leading today's final round of the Bell Canadian Open by one stroke on the final hole, Woods executed a shot that required both boldness and brilliance. Standing in a fairway bunker, 218 yards from the pin, with water guarding the front and right sides of the green, Woods hit a 6-iron shot that will add to his legend. As his club met the ball, it rocketed out of the bunker and soared majestically as the gallery at Glen Abbey Golf Club watched, eyes staring upward as if they were watching a space-shuttle launch. Somehow, the ball cleared the water, sailed directly over the flag stick and came to rest just off the green, 18 feet past the hole.</p>

        <p>The situation called for something spectacular, which meant the situation was perfect for Tiger Woods.</p>
        <p>Leading today's final round of the Bell Canadian Open by one stroke on the final hole, Woods executed a shot that required both boldness and brilliance. Standing in a fairway bunker, 218 yards from the pin, with water guarding the front and right sides of the green, Woods hit a 6-iron shot that will add to his legend. As his club met the ball, it rocketed out of the bunker and soared majestically as the gallery at Glen Abbey Golf Club watched, eyes staring upward as if they were watching a space-shuttle launch. Somehow, the ball cleared the water, sailed directly over the flag stick and came to rest just off the green, 18 feet past the hole.</p>
        <p>Who else can do that with a 6-iron, out of a fairway bunker? And even if you had the shot, would you have the courage to pull it off, at that moment, with the tournament on the line?</p>
        <p>When the ball landed, the gallery erupted. Grant Waite, Woods's playing partner, could only shake his head in disbelief.</p>
        <p>''Amazing,'' Waite said. ''To have the mind-set, the calmness in his body to hit that shot, is the advantage he has over other players.''</p>
        <p>Add Waite's name to the list of those who have played superbly against Woods, but not well enough to beat him. Winning by one stroke, and joining Lee Trevino (1971) as the only players to win the Canadian Open, the United States Open and the British Open in the same year, Woods finished at 22 under par (72-65-64-65) for a total of 266, one stroke ahead of Waite (21 under, 69-64-68-66), who felt he would have beaten any other player.</p>
        <p>With the victory, Woods continued a year that is arguably the best in golf history. Woods has won nine tournaments this year, the most since Sam Snead won 11 times in 1950. Byron Nelson won a record 18 tournaments in 1945, but the Masters, the British Open and the United States Open were not played that year because of World War II.</p>
        <p>Woods has won three major championships this year, matching Ben Hogan, who won three majors in 1951. Woods has 9 victories in 17 starts on tour this year, a winning percentage of .541. And since last year's Memorial tournament, he has won 16 of 27 starts, or 59 percent.</p>
        <p>But Woods was tested today, just as he was tested by Bob May during the final round of the P.G.A. Championship, which Woods won in a three-hole playoff last month. Neither Woods nor Waite made a bogey all day, and they made 13 birdies between them, taking full advantage of lift-clean-and-place rules. Starting the day tied at 15 under par, Woods and Waite pulled from the field and turned the back nine into a one-on-one showdown.</p>
        <p>It was heady stuff for Waite, a 36-year-old veteran from New Zealand, whose lone victory on tour came in 1993. But for Woods, being in a pressure-packed situation felt right at home, another chance to show why he is the world's best player.</p>
        <p>''I thoroughly enjoy being in that situation,' said Woods, who won $594,000 to increase his earnings this year to a record-setting $8.28 million. ''It's a thrill to see what you have inside. I've been in that situation a number of times. Sure, I get nervous, but I know how to handle it. In pressure situations, your concentration gets higher, you focus everything on what you're doing. It was a lot of fun.''</p>
        <p>Woods took the lead for good on the par-5 16th hole, making a 12-foot putt for birdie. A key moment occurred earlier on that hole, when Waite was distracted by someone taking a picture and hit his tee shot well right of the fairway, forcing him to scramble for par.</p>
        <p>Two holes later, Woods sealed the victory at the par-5 No. 18, hitting his miraculous bunker shot after hitting his stray tee shot. Before Woods stepped into the bunker, Waite had hit his second shot on the green, 25 feet from the pin. So instead of laying up safely in the fairway from the bunker, Woods went for the green.</p>
        <p>''If I had known he was going to do that, I would have tried to hit my second shot closer to the pin,'' Waite said. ''But I figure, he's in the bunker, there's water on the right, all the way down, and a bunker in back of the green. But he goes right at the pin.''</p>
        <p>Waite still had a chance to make his 25-footer for eagle, but he missed and settled for birdie. Woods then chipped from 18 feet to 18 inches, then tapped in for birdie to seal another victory.</p>
        <p>Woods will take the next five weeks off, before playing for the United States in the Presidents Cup in mid-October. Woods deserves a vacation. But when he plays, he simply refuses to give anyone else a break.</p>
