        <p>FOUR YEARS ago in Atlanta, the United States women's softball team, with one defeat in the previous 10 years of international competition, was supposed to win the Olympic gold medal in a walkover. Then the Australians defeated the United States, 2-1, in 10 innings of an early-round game. Then it was up to the Chinese women to press the Americans in the gold-medal game. The Americans narrowly avoided a stunning upset when America's fiery infielder Dot Richardson hit a dramatic game-ending home run.</p>
        <p>During these Olympics, the Americans are still heavily favored -- most think this year's team has more power hitters -- but the Australians and Chinese have improved, too. They are more experienced, with each team having farmed out its best players to foreign professional softball leagues between Olympic Games.</p>

        <p>FOUR YEARS ago in Atlanta, the United States women's softball team, with one defeat in the previous 10 years of international competition, was supposed to win the Olympic gold medal in a walkover. Then the Australians defeated the United States, 2-1, in 10 innings of an early-round game. Then it was up to the Chinese women to press the Americans in the gold-medal game. The Americans narrowly avoided a stunning upset when America's fiery infielder Dot Richardson hit a dramatic game-ending home run.</p>
        <p>During these Olympics, the Americans are still heavily favored -- most think this year's team has more power hitters -- but the Australians and Chinese have improved, too. They are more experienced, with each team having farmed out its best players to foreign professional softball leagues between Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- Eight teams play a round-robin tournament, with the top four teams advancing to the semifinals followed by the gold-medal game.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- It's nine players a side, no extra outfielder. A game is usually seven innings, but if the score is still tied after nine innings, each team starts its turn at bat with a runner at second base.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- It's a pitcher's game even if the hitters wield aluminum bats. Bunting is common, as is the attempt to chop down on a pitch, hitting a high-bouncing ground ball that either leads to an infield hit or bounces over the infield. Games that end 1-0 and 2-1 are routine.</p>
        <p>Home runs are rare, but the Americans have developed some pull hitters who can go deep, most notably Crystl Bustos and Jen Brundage.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- Lisa Fernandez, the top American pitcher who also hit .348 in the Atlanta Summer Games, is back. Michele Smith is the team's other premier pitcher.</p>
        <p>Richardson, who will turn 39 on Sept. 22, is the oldest member of the United States team. Bustos is a newcomer to the Olympic team, but some believe she will eventually be the best women's softball hitter in history.</p>
        <p>The Australians are led by pitcher Tanya Harding -- not that Tonya Harding -- who did not allow an earned run in 22 2/3 innings of work during the Atlanta Games and defeated the Americans.</p>
