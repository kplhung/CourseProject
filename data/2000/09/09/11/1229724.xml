        <p>THE GAME is ''hockey'' to aficionados, who defensively insist on calling the version played on skates with a puck ''ice hockey.'' But the aficionados should feel appreciated at these Olympics, where field hockey will be more visible than ever because of Australia's affection for and proficiency at this hard-running, low-scoring game.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- There will be 12 men's teams and 10 women's teams in Sydney, and the only Americans on the artificial turf will be officials. Neither the American men nor, more surprisingly, the American women qualified. The semifinalists are determined by pool play, with the top two teams in each pool going to the medal round.</p>

        <p>THE GAME is ''hockey'' to aficionados, who defensively insist on calling the version played on skates with a puck ''ice hockey.'' But the aficionados should feel appreciated at these Olympics, where field hockey will be more visible than ever because of Australia's affection for and proficiency at this hard-running, low-scoring game.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- There will be 12 men's teams and 10 women's teams in Sydney, and the only Americans on the artificial turf will be officials. Neither the American men nor, more surprisingly, the American women qualified. The semifinalists are determined by pool play, with the top two teams in each pool going to the medal round.</p>
        <p>THE SCORING -- Halves are 35 minutes long, and if that does not produce a winner, two sudden-death overtime periods (each seven-plus minutes long) are played. If that still does not work, the medals will come down to penalty strokes in which players take turns shooting on goal. As in ice hockey -- let us give the aficionados what they want -- players can be forced to leave the game for short periods to serve penalties for fouls.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- The Australian women, known rather unimaginatively as the Hockeyroos, have had a mediocre season: finishing third in this year's prestigious Champions Trophy tournament behind Germany and the Netherlands. But the now-chastened Hockeyroos remain the favorites to defend the Olympic title they won in Atlanta (they also won in Seoul, South Korea, in 1988). South Korea could also be a factor. In the men's event, the Australian men, known not much more imaginatively as the Kookaburras, are also medal contenders but have a reputation for succumbing to pressure (they have never won an Olympic gold medal).</p>
        <p>The Dutch, who won in 1996, and the Germans, who won in 1992, do not have such skeletons rattling around in their closets. The Indian men, incidentally, are considered to have an outside chance for a medal after 20 years of frustration in a game they once utterly dominated.</p>
