        <p>Many people still drop in at simple two-story house in Lagos, Nigeria, that was home of late Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, King of Afrobeat and foe of Nigerian dictators, who lived there with his many wives, family and friends and threw best parties in all of Nigeria, and probably all of West Africa; map; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Downstairs, the dancer in the tight orange tank top and white pants, her naked navel in between, lay languidly on a couch. The man slumped beside her snored gently. The others passed around joints that filled the room with the strong whiff of marijuana.</p>
        <p>Upstairs, the son regarded as the inheritor of the place came out of the bathroom with a white towel around his waist. ''I'm looking messed up,'' Seun Anikulapo-Kuti told an unannounced visitor who had interrupted his bath on this afternoon. ''I'll be out in 10.''</p>
        <p>The party is not as wild as it used to be, the music not as good, here at 11 Gbemisola Street, since the death of the master of the house, the king of Afrobeat, the fearless foe of Nigeria's dictators, the great Fela Anikulapo-Kuti. It was three years ago that Fela, as he was known, died from AIDS, after packing several lifetimes into 58 years.</p>
        <p>He had lampooned the army that threw him into jail, the army that burned down his house and killed his mother. He had married 27 women on the same day. He had championed Africa's powerless, knocking down the mighty, including President Olusegun Obasanjo, when he was the country's military ruler a generation ago. And Fela had transformed all of that into a magical fusion of music called Afrobeat and had become Africa's most famous musician.</p>
        <p>For years, Fela had lived at this address inside a simple two-story white house, with his wives, children, dancers, singers and whoever happened to be passing by on a particular day. The best party in Lagos -- surely the best party in Nigeria, if not all of West Africa -- was said to have taken place here every day. Africa's rich men live inside compounds surrounded by impregnable gates and guards; but Fela's house was always open.</p>
        <p>''He wanted to live a free life where everyone could come close to him,'' said Kunle, 29, another son.</p>
        <p>Three of Fela's children still live here, along with other relatives and his former dancers and singers. The house eschews the marble floors, European furniture and air-conditioned rooms typical of the Nigerian rich in favor of sparsely furnished rooms and walls painted in Fela's favorite color, orange.</p>
        <p>A glass cabinet at the top of the main staircase on the first floor, which some months before had contained 112 of Fela's performance shoes, was half-empty.</p>
        <p>''They have been stealing them,'' said the dancer, Olayinka Anjorian, without giving details. ''There's no more Fela,'' she went on. ''When he was around, we enjoyed ourselves. We had shows every Friday night. Everybody is dull now.''</p>
        <p>Still, many have kept coming.</p>
        <p>''We all learned one thing or another here,'' said a 32-year-old musician who goes by the name Eddy Remedy. ''Even if you didn't get to meet the man, you got inspired by this place. After work, I come over here, catch one or two things, smoke, too.''</p>
        <p>''Afrobeat is still the only music in Nigeria where you can say what you feel, tell the government what you think,'' he went on. ''Afrobeat is a weapon for us. That's why I love his sons for keeping his legacy alive.''</p>
        <p>Inside his room upstairs, just out of his bath, Seun had put on a Phoenix Coyotes jersey and Timberland boots. Fela's oldest son, Femi, has become a famous singer in his own right and has been touring Europe and America in the last year. But many Nigerians believe that in mannerisms, style and spirit, Seun is the closest reincarnation of the father.</p>
        <p>''Right now I'm 17 years, 8 months and -- what's the date? -- 17 days,'' he said. ''Is it 3 o'clock yet? Sixteen days and some hours.''</p>
        <p>Seun said he was coming out with a remix of his father's songs. He was planning to play at the New Shrine, the club his brother Femi planned to open on Oct. 15, their father's birthday. Fela's old club, the Shrine, was closed down a couple of years ago.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes,'' Seun said, when asked whether he likes Nigeria. ''Sometimes not.''</p>
        <p>''We've not had democracy in a long time,'' he said. ''Instead of legislators we have legislooters. Instead of legislating, they are legi-stealing.''</p>
        <p>Seun grew up in this house. Although Fela married 27 women in a ceremony in 1978, he had only six children. Seun said he planned to stick with one wife.</p>
        <p>The first house, which Fela had called the Kalakuta Republic, fell in 1977. He had hurled attacks on the army in songs like ''Zombie.''</p>
        <p>The army and federal government, both of which were led at the time by General Obasanjo, eventually responded by sending more than 1,000 soldiers to Fela's house. The soldiers burned it down and threw Fela's 78-year-old mother out of a second-story window. His mother, Funmilayo -- famous for being a pioneer in Nigeria's liberation movement and the first woman in Nigeria to drive a car -- died several months later.</p>
        <p>Fela turned all of this into some of his best music, epic songs that went on for 20 to 30 minutes in hypnotic sounds and angry words. In ''Coffin for Head of State,'' he sang in colloquial Nigerian English of how he and his followers walked through the streets of Lagos, carrying his mother's coffin, toward Dodan Barracks, the former seat of government.</p>
        <p>''Waka waka waka,'' sings the chorus as the marchers walked to the gates of Dodan Barracks. ''We put the coffin down,'' Fela sings. ''Obasanjo dey there with him big fat stomach.'' The military ruler refuses to take the coffin as Fela angrily orders him to do so: ''Obasanjo carry am. But dem take am.''</p>
        <p>After a government inquiry concluded that an ''unknown soldier'' had thrown Fela's mother out the window, he replied with a song with that title. The government inquiry was like magic, he sang acerbically: ''Dem start magic, dem bring hat, dem bring rabbit, dem bring egg, dem bring smoke'' and ''then they say: unknown soldier.''</p>
        <p>And so Fela built a new house here. Nigeria's most famous musician lived like an ordinary man, explained his son Kunle, as he unlocked the door to Fela's bedroom.</p>
        <p>It was maybe 200 square feet, with orange walls and a small fan on the ceiling. A foam mattress was pushed against the wall, though a sheet lay on the rug where, his son said, Fela had got into the habit of sleeping. A saxophone sat on the floor; scores of his performance clothes lined the walls, though he usually preferred to perform dressed only in bikini briefs. The only photographs were of himself and his mother.</p>
        <p>A small radio, an old television set, an old dresser with a large mirror -- all of these were ordinary items. An icebox, where Fela kept cakes and ice cream, was the only luxury.</p>
        <p>''As an African man, he didn't believe in European things,'' Kunle said, adding that the room had been left intact since his father died in August 1997 and was buried in front of the house.</p>
        <p>Time had blanketed the room with a thick layer of dust. Yet somehow a large white clock resting on the dresser was still ticking and showing the right time.</p>
