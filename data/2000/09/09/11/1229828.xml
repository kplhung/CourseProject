        <p>NBC is obsessed with making Sydney an essential character in its coverage of these Olympics in a way that Barcelona, Spain, and Atlanta never were in 1992 and 1996. The attempts to make the city a star -- from elaborate features to a tower-mounted camera focused on the Olympic caldron with downtown Sydney in the background -- began in April 1995 when NBC, ABC, Fox and CBS officials first visited the city.</p>
        <p>''In 1992, in Barcelona, we were just trying to get all the sports right,'' said Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports. ''We didn't do many pieces about Spain. And in Atlanta, our research showed that people knew all they wanted to know about Atlanta and the South. I feel a responsibility to portray Australia accurately. I've been here 18 times, and we've been treated so well, we feel we have to do something serious. We're not doing 'G'day.' ''</p>

        <p>NBC is obsessed with making Sydney an essential character in its coverage of these Olympics in a way that Barcelona, Spain, and Atlanta never were in 1992 and 1996. The attempts to make the city a star -- from elaborate features to a tower-mounted camera focused on the Olympic caldron with downtown Sydney in the background -- began in April 1995 when NBC, ABC, Fox and CBS officials first visited the city.</p>
        <p>''In 1992, in Barcelona, we were just trying to get all the sports right,'' said Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports. ''We didn't do many pieces about Spain. And in Atlanta, our research showed that people knew all they wanted to know about Atlanta and the South. I feel a responsibility to portray Australia accurately. I've been here 18 times, and we've been treated so well, we feel we have to do something serious. We're not doing 'G'day.' ''</p>
        <p>The features prepared by NBC include profiles of the Sydney Opera House architect who was fired before his masterwork was completed and the relationship among the people of Perth, who lit up their city when John Glenn soared over in his Mercury capsule in 1962 and repeated the gesture when Glenn was aboard the space shuttle.</p>
        <p>But not everything is serious. Jimmy Roberts had barely spent two days in Sydney before Ebersol dispatched him west to Perth to board the India Pacific train for a four-day ride back to Sydney.</p>
        <p>Roberts will also deliver ''G.M. Moments,'' a series of daily features, successors to the often emotional essays delivered in 1996 by Dick Enberg, who has since moved to CBS. A tentative schedule of 18 moments is listed in Roberts's office, including one that is planned for Sept. 19 about Terrence Parkin, a deaf South African swimmer. ''Can you imagine an athlete who can't hear the applause?'' Roberts asked.</p>
