        <p>THIS IN-THE-water member of the soccer/hockey/basketball family can be ultra physical. It certainly was in 1956 in Melbourne, the last time the Olympics were held in Australia.</p>
        <p>A month after Soviet troops invaded Hungary to put down an uprising, the Soviet and Hungarian water polo teams met in the Olympics. The angry Hungarians made the game brutal, and there was blood in the pool as Hungary won.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- There are 12 men's and 6 women's teams, each using seven players, including a goalkeeper. The men will play two six-team round-robins to qualify for playoffs, with the round-robin winners meeting for the gold medal. The women, in their Olympic debut, will play a round-robin, with the top four teams playing for the medals. The men's pool is 30 by 20 meters (33 by 22 yards) and must be at least 2 meters (6 1/2 feet) deep. The women's pool is slightly smaller. A game lasts four seven-minute quarters. Players are not allowed to touch the bottom or sides of the pool.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- Much like basketball. Most scoring comes from counterattacks (fast breaks), and if that is foiled, the next options are getting the ball to the low post (the 2-meter position) or shooting from the perimeter.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- The strongest teams are the Yugoslav, Hungarian and American men and the Australian, Dutch and American women. Chris Humbert (6 feet 7 inches, 235 pounds) of Lodi, Calif., is perhaps the world's best man at the 2-meter position. Coralie Simmons, an attacker from Hemet, Calif., leads the American women.</p>
