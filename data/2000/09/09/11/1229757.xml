        <p>When the local daily newspaper Reforma ran a front-page picture of Ricardo Miguel Cavallo, director of Mexico's national motor vehicle bureau, a shock of recognition ran halfway round the world.</p>
        <p>The face -- thin, almost fragile, silver hair, icy eyes, a half-smile -- was familiar in Buenos Aires, in Barcelona, in Mexico City. Scores of survivors of Argentina's military junta, which killed tens of thousands a generation ago, said they knew Mr. Cavallo as ''Serpico.'' They remembered him from the torture chamber inside the mechanics' school of the Argentine Navy. Under the junta, from 1976 to 1983, more than 5,000 people disappeared into that chamber. Most were never seen again.</p>
        <p>Susana Burgos, who had lived through two years of captivity, knew that face: ''Older, but with the same look, the same eyes,'' she said. She had faint hope of seeing her tormentor punished. But when the newspaper stories ran, so did Mr. Cavallo -- for a plane back to his native Argentina, where officers who served the junta have official amnesty. The flight stopped in Cancun, Mexico, where Mr. Cavallo was arrested, just before midnight on Aug. 24, on charges of terrorism and torture.</p>
        <p>The warrant came from across the Atlantic, in the name of Spanish citizens who suffered and died in Argentina. It was signed by the same judge, Baltasar Garzon, who tried last year to extradite Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator of Chile, on charges of genocide.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Cavallo's case appears likely to create a precedent that General Pinochet's did not: the principle that the law knows no borders, that a person can reach across frontiers and back through time to seek justice for crimes against humanity.</p>
        <p>Mexico must now decide whether Mr. Cavallo should be sent to Spain to stand trial for crimes committed 20 years ago in Argentina. And if Mexico extradites him, it would be unprecedented in the annals of international law, human rights experts say.</p>
        <p>''There will be no refuge for torturers, even in a country that used to be a paradise of corruption and impunity,'' said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch.</p>
        <p>''When you arrest Pinochet, it sends a chill through the tyrants,'' said Reed Brody, the group's advocacy director. ''When you arrest Cavallo, it sends tremors through the ranks, and tells them they have fewer places to hide. It says to the ranks of police officers and soldiers that if they commit torture today, they could be prosecuted tomorrow, and not only in Spain.''</p>
        <p>Mexico, like many other nations, has long placed the principle of its sovereignty above the ideals of human rights. It became a kind of haven for Latin American military officers suspected of cold-war crimes, just as Argentina once was a refuge for Nazis.</p>
        <p>Mexican officials have given no indication how they will decide the case of Mr. Cavallo. But Mr. Brody said he expected Mexico to comply with the Spanish judge's extradition request, a decision that appeared more likely after Mexico agreed on Thursday to the United Nations' plan for an international criminal court. The United States, saying it wants to protect its own sovereignty, has so far refused to go along with the idea of the international criminal court.</p>
        <p>Mexico's Commerce Department set up a new national motor vehicle registry bureau last year, ostensibly to fight auto theft, and Mr. Cavallo won a 10-year concession to run it. He had helped his brother set up a similar service, a national data base of automobile serial numbers and titles, in El Salvador. Mr. Cavallo is listed as a director and part owner of that company.</p>
        <p>Popular opposition and allegations of incompetence hounded the Mexican bureau. On Thursday, an under secretary of commerce, Raul Ramos Tercero, was found dead on a highway outside Mexico City, his throat and wrists slashed. Mexican officials linked his death, which has officially been called a suicide, to the Cavallo case.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Cavallo's resume showed he had served under the Argentine junta, he was hired last year. During and after the last years of the junta, which fell in 1983, many of its soldiers turned up elsewhere in Latin America, selling their skills to armies and governments.</p>
        <p>His brother, Oscar, now in El Salvador, said in an interview that whatever Mr. Cavallo had done in Argentina had happened long ago and far away, and should be forgiven and forgotten.</p>
        <p>''How far should we go back to undertake revisionism in the world?'' he said. ''We could judge Spain for colonizing America and killing indigenous people. When are we going to stop?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cavallo's lawyer says that he may be a victim of mistaken identity, and that if he is not, the laws of Argentina will pardon him. Many Latin American governments have granted their cold warriors sweeping amnesties, seeking to induce a kind of national amnesia. Though they killed their own people, the accused can go free, and their victims have little hope for justice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cavallo was hired in August 1999, and came to Mexico permanently last fall. In November, Judge Garzon cited him in a formal charge of terrorism and torture. But it was not until two weeks ago that the connection was made between the Mr. Cavallo who victims said they remembered as the young servant of the Argentine junta and the middle-aged government contractor in Mexico. France also wants to question Mr. Cavallo, who served as a military attache in Paris in 1982 and 1983, about the deaths of 15 French citizens, including two nuns, under the junta.</p>
        <p>In 1996, Judge Garzon, whose job is to investigate rather than to try cases, had opened a criminal case after Spanish lawyers asked him to look into the torture, disappearance and killing of Spanish citizens under the Argentine junta.</p>
        <p>''These are very grave violations,'' he said in 1998. ''We have a moral debt with the relatives of hundreds of victims.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Burgos and four other survivors told Judge Garzon that Mr. Cavallo had helped run the mechanics' school. ''Cavallo was one of the naval officers there who would lead the kidnappers who would go out and snatch people, then bring them back to the school,'' Ms. Burgos said in an interview from Barcelona. ''I understand he became one of the school's bosses.</p>
        <p>''We were tortured there,'' she said. ''On arrival, we were beaten, and then for days during those first weeks they would soak us with water and attach electrical charges to our bodies and zap us with 220 volts. Later they'd use psychological torture, telling us they were going to go out and kill our children, our families.''</p>
        <p>As many as 30,000 people were killed by the junta; thousands were dumped in rivers and the sea, buried in mass graves, made to disappear.</p>
        <p>Among them were six members of Natalia Bruschtein's family -- her father, grandfather, aunts and uncles. She is now 25 and her hair is turning gray. She has lived in exile in Mexico City nearly all her life. She does not remember her father, who was seized by the junta when she was an infant. Her mother tells her he was a leftist guerrilla, but more idealist than ideologue.</p>
        <p>In the last week, she has been organizing Argentine exiles in Mexico City to call on the Mexican government to send Mr. Cavallo to stand trial in Spain. ''This is our way to recover the people we lost,'' she said. ''Anytime I can do something for my father, it is a way to recover some part of him.''</p>
        <p>''The military will win only if they are able to make us forget,'' she added. ''Our memories are our greatest defense.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Ignacio Maldonado Martinez has heard many memories of a man named Serpico. An Argentine exile who has lived here for 25 years, he is a psychiatrist who has treated many victims of the junta. ''They told stories, even years after torture, with absolute clarity,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Roughly 30 of them ''remembered the person named Serpico,'' named after the New York City policeman, immortalized by Hollywood, whose testimony sent corrupt officers to prison 30 years ago.</p>
        <p>The Argentine Serpico also played the role of good cop. ''He'd play the good guy amid evil to drive his subjects crazy,'' Dr. Maldonado said.  His victims remembered ''the good torturer,'' a calm young man ''with a very smooth voice,'' who was ''very personable, friendly'' as he threatened torture and death, he said.</p>
        <p>''When I saw his picture in Reforma,'' Dr. Maldonado said, ''the first thing I thought was, this is what I had imagined, exactly -- a man with a friendly face, but with a halfway terrible look.''</p>
        <p>Argentina's president, Fernando de la Rua, said on Tuesday that he opposed Mr. Cavallo's extradition. ''The government of Argentina insists on the principle of territoriality in the application of criminal law,'' he said, arguing that no one should be tried abroad for crimes committed in his native land.</p>
        <p>Chile used that same argument in urging Britain not to send General Pinochet to be tried in Spain. In March, after 16 months of house arrest in England, he was allowed to fly home to Chile.</p>
        <p>But photos, fingerprints and the first-hand testimony of torture victims rule out the idea that Mr. Cavallo is not the man known as Serpico, according to the Mexican branch of Interpol, the international police organization.</p>
        <p>And the laws of his native land may not apply to him anymore.</p>
        <p>''Pinochet's long detention in London has shown that globalization has now expanded from economic affairs to the institutions of politics and justice,'' Chile's new president, Ricardo Lagos, said recently.</p>
