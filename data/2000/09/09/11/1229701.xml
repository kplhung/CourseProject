        <p>THIS is an awesome task for the athletes. They must save the Olympic movement. They must wrest the focus back from the sleaze merchants who connived under the cover of the five rings.</p>
        <p>They must leap over time zones, break down the artificiality of the taped telecasts, get past the greed and the stuffiness of the International Olympic Committee.</p>
        <p>Don't dwell on the Australian big shot who foisted his own child on the torch procession, just because he had the power to do it. Try not to obsess on the committee that could not find one woman on this planet to nominate for the next generation of I.O.C. delegates.</p>
        <p>The next two weeks belong to the athletes, now arriving in Australia from all over the world.</p>
        <p>Resurrecting any vestigial dignity of the Olympics is particularly important back in the United States, which presumably still exists through the numbing maze of international datelines and jet lag.</p>
        <p>Back in Dollarland are affluent sponsors who will watch carefully to see if they are besmirched, plus the massive potential television audience, 15 to 18 time zones behind Australia.</p>
        <p>The athletes must be compelling enough to get Americans into their easy chairs in prime time to watch events that were held hours, days, maybe even weeks earlier.</p>
        <p>Over here, the athletes will exist in real time. Cathy Freeman, the Aboriginal runner, has so much weight on her shoulders, it will be a miracle if she can push off at the start line. But she must.</p>
        <p>Freeman's people will be demonstrating against two centuries of overt racial discrimination. She can touch millions, remind them there are always men of money and power who try to possess a people or an event, but sometimes you have to take it back.</p>
        <p>The athletes must revalidate the Olympic movement. All over the world, the Olympic Games are a biennial apparition, materializing out of the mists like Brigadoon.</p>
        <p>Meantime, the world gathers in front of the ubiquitous television to watch somebody scoring a goal every minute of every day, and now basketball is the hot sport, Bulls shirts everywhere, and cricket and Tiger madness and auto racing and hockey and baseball -- big arenas, big cable, big Internet.</p>
        <p>The Olympics try to glom onto some of these big sports, inviting them into the big tent, but even the imported superstars cannot hide the odor of scandal.</p>
        <p>Lusting for a Nobel Prize, Juan Antonio Samaranch persistently invokes the aura of ''the children of the world'' whenever he opens and closes the Games. Now the children and the adults have seen the spectacle of I.O.C. delegates arriving in Utah with gunnysacks, and businessmen from that smug little corner of the world instinctively filling those sacks with goodies.</p>
        <p>The world has seen Australian Olympic officials instinctively channel the best tickets to their pals, just the way the previous bunch instinctively did in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>It is a lot to ask of the athletes, but Popov, the swimmer man, and Fernandez, the softball pitcher, must remind the world that sport, when it is clean and honest, is one of the world's more compelling sights.</p>
        <p>This is not like a World Cup of soccer or even our local phenomenon, the Super Bowl of American football, where the majority of fans know the inside stories.</p>
        <p>The Olympics just drop in our laps, and suddenly we are being asked to care about this stuff in a very short time. Now the question must be asked: What if nobody cares anymore?</p>
        <p>The best part of the Games is still the athletes who train for little money, who regard these Games as their highest athletic calling. The Dream Teams and the tennis stars are imported window dressing.</p>
        <p>It is up to television to convey not only the humanity but also the urgency, to bring back the action to the Games. This is not an easy task. In recent Olympic Games, even with time zones on their side, the networks have resorted to the feature approach -- the private glimpse, the families, the injuries, the pain.</p>
        <p>Lost in the soap operas and the sonorous narration, however, has been the spontaneity of the Games.</p>
        <p>The canned approach may not work anymore because television has spewed forth an inordinate amount of personal stuff: exhibitionists bludgeoning each other on the Springer show, egomaniacs voting each other off the island on ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>The Americans who seem to enjoy the Olympics the most live near the Canadian border. People in Buffalo and Detroit and Seattle rave about the CBC coverage -- live events, a more worldly view.</p>
        <p>This year NBC will show 161 1/2 hours on the main network, plus another 276 hours on CNBC and MSNBC on cable -- none of it live, mind you, but nevertheless whole swatches of field hockey and kayaking and high jumping and wrestling.</p>
        <p>NBC promises us the youth, the health, the skills, the spirit, the zeal, the impromptu glory of live sport. (With any luck at all, the chemical enhancement of blood and muscle will not overwhelm the Games.)</p>
        <p>After observing the connivers and the freeloaders of the I.O.C., the world may be ready for some athletic competition. Or maybe the world is ready for soccer season and football season and the baseball pennant races.</p>
        <p>If the athletes come across as arrogant and corrupt and drug infested or even just insignificant, they fall to the level of the Olympic leaders, and maybe the whole pretentious ship goes down.</p>
