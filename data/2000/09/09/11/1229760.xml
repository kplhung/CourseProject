        <p>Disillusioned by their leaders and a system that still heavily favors vested interests, Hong Kong residents turned out in smaller numbers than expected on Sunday to vote in the second legislative election since this former British colony reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.</p>
        <p>Roughly 1.3 million people, or 43 percent of registered voters, went to the polls on a balmy, late-summer day. Two years ago, in the first post-colonial election, nearly 1.5 million people, more than 53 percent of voters, braved a torrential downpour to cast ballots.</p>
        <p>Experts attributed the low turnout to a variety of factors, not the least the weather, which they said filled Hong Kong's playgrounds and beaches at the expense of its polling booths. But most agreed that widespread unhappiness with the territory's Beijing-appointed government had alienated voters.</p>
        <p>''Of course, we are not satisfied,'' said Tung Chee-hwa, the chief executive, as he visited the counting center in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center shortly after polls closed at 10:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tung noted that elections are a relatively new phenomenon in Hong Kong, adding, ''The development of our political system will slowly mature.''</p>
        <p>The subdued atmosphere throughout Hong Kong was a stark contrast to the feeling in May 1998, when the city throbbed with excitement during its first election under Chinese rule. On that day, pro-democracy candidates, whom Beijing had ousted from the Legislature after the handover, were swept to victory.</p>
        <p>In Sunday's voting, the pro-democracy parties appeared to retain the largest block of directly elected seats in the Legislature, based on exit polls. But the main pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, seemed likely to increase its seats, from five to eight.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Alliance would probably have made even bigger gains if one of its leaders had not stumbled into a scandal over his failure to disclose business interests. Analysts say the party's success is evidence that people are now more inclined to court Beijing than to rebuff it.</p>
        <p>''Hong Kong people are very pragmatic,'' said Lau Siu-kai, a professor of politics at the Chinese University. ''If a party can pull strings in Beijing and Hong Kong, they will support it.''</p>
        <p>The largest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party, was licking its wounds, apparently winning less of the popular vote than in 1998. Its standard-bearer, Martin Lee, was holding on to his seat.</p>
        <p>More than a victory or defeat for any party, experts said the lackluster election was a rebuke to the government of Mr. Tung.</p>
        <p>Michael DeGolyer, a pollster at Baptist University, said his latest survey of Hong Kong residents showed the lowest level of satisfaction with life here since he began taking polls in 1993. He said people blamed the government for failing to lift Hong Kong more quickly out of its recession, for the stubbornly high unemployment rate and for lurching from one scandal to another.</p>
        <p>Rather than rush to the polls to register their anger, however, Mr. DeGolyer said voters were opting out of the political process. That is because they perceive it as being stacked in favor of business and government interests.</p>
        <p>The number of directly elected seats in the Legislature will increase to 30 in 2004 under an agreement between Britain and China governing the return of Hong Kong. But whatever its composition, the Legislature is largely toothless because it cannot introduce bills without the government's assent.</p>
        <p>''We are not talking about electing a government,'' said Professor Lau. ''People really do not see the Legislature as having much influence on policy.''</p>
        <p>At a polling booth in Wanchai on Sunday evening, voters seemed pulled between a sense of civic duty and a recognition that their vote would have little effect on how Hong Kong is governed.</p>
        <p>''Democracy is very important to me because we are used to free speech in Hong Kong,'' said Lee Man Shan, a 38-year-old housewife. Mrs. Lee said she watched televised debates between the candidates and studied the party platforms.</p>
        <p>But Herman Leung, 42, who works for a trading company, said he just wanted to make sure the Legislature was not hijacked by radicals. ''If you elect someone who is against China, then Hong Kong is in trouble,'' he said. ''But if you elect someone who follows everything China says, then Hong Kong is also in trouble.''</p>
