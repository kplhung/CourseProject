        <p>Your Sept. 4 news article about the State Department's losing its attraction as a lifelong career was right on the mark. Perhaps this trend reflects the reality that in today's economy, career changes are expected and often welcomed.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Sept. 4 news article about the State Department's losing its attraction as a lifelong career was right on the mark. Perhaps this trend reflects the reality that in today's economy, career changes are expected and often welcomed.</p>
        <p>However, it is understandable that topnotch officials are frustrated by a scattershot personnel assignment system, the eternal shuffling of ineffectual personnel, the placement of officers with little management expertise into managerial positions, a promotion system plagued by the worst excesses of grade inflation, an inability to deal informally with other government agencies and nongovernmental organizations, and the endless shuffling of papers to little effect.</p>
        <p>As a former diplomat, I know that people join the State Department to perform fulfilling work in the service of their country, not to make their fortunes. But unless the department's hidebound management addresses its glaring problems, it will increasingly lose those who are best able to carry out our foreign policy.</p>
