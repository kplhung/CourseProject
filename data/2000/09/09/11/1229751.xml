        <p>Twenty-five years ago, anyone in the market for a tomb with a view would have been hard pressed to top Williamson Creek Cemetery, perched on a shady hill in a grove of cedar trees, looking out over a peaceful valley of rolling pasture just south of town.</p>

        <p>Twenty-five years ago, anyone in the market for a tomb with a view would have been hard pressed to top Williamson Creek Cemetery, perched on a shady hill in a grove of cedar trees, looking out over a peaceful valley of rolling pasture just south of town.</p>
        <p>''There were no buildings anywhere in sight, and all you could hear were birds and wildlife calling to each other. It was serene and spiritual,'' said Karen R. Thompson, president of Save Texas Cemeteries, a preservation group.</p>
        <p>Today, Williamson Creek Cemetery overlooks the parking lot of a multiscreen Cineplex, and the sounds now are traffic from a nearby Interstate and the roar of bulldozers carving roads for a shopping mall.</p>
        <p>Austin's sprawling growth has overtaken the cemetery and will soon encircle it.</p>
        <p>''We've got 10 cemeteries near Austin that we're concerned about, and statewide we lose at least one a month to developers just paving them over,'' said Mrs. Thompson, 56. ''That's a tragedy, because when we destroy a cemetery, we destroy history.''</p>
        <p>As population growth explodes in the South and West, yet another issue has emerged: some cities have so many new residents that they are encroaching on cemeteries.</p>
        <p>Similar issues exist in other states, but the problem is particularly pronounced in Texas.</p>
        <p>Here, the complex legal history of land titles and land-use issues -- which can include Spanish and Mexican land grants -- and at times, the clouded ownership status of cemetery property, have made the Legislature reluctant to address cemetery preservation. County governments also do not have the power to enact ordinances to protect cemeteries.  ''It's an enormous problem all over the state,'' said Gerron Hite, cemetery preservation coordinator for the Texas State Historical Commission, who puts the number of cemeteries in Texas at 40,000 to 50,000.</p>
        <p>The state is conducting a $1.1 million study in 107 counties, chosen because of their rate of growth, to identify cemeteries that might be threatened.</p>
        <p>Many of those cemeteries began as family burial sites in the 19th century but became community burial grounds as towns grew up around them; others, often isolated and remote, were simply forgotten as families died off or moved.</p>
        <p>But the problem illustrates how Texas has changed in 50 years, with the past, as represented by the old cemeteries, giving way to creeping urbanization, Mrs. Thompson said.</p>
        <p>''It used to be you could pause and reflect in a cemetery,'' she said. ''Nowadays, you just hope you don't get run over.''</p>
        <p>While the nation's population grew by 9.7 percent from 1990 to 1999, the South grew by 13.7 percent and the West by 15.7 percent, according to the Census Bureau. Texas' population grew 18 percent, to about 20 million.</p>
        <p>Much of the growth has been outside the urban core of Texas cities, which is why cemeteries, traditionally built on a city's fringe, are threatened. In the hills around Austin, for example, the population of Williamson County, home of Dell Computers, grew by over 70 percent to 240,000 from 139,000. Hays County, south of Austin, increased 41 percent, to about 92,000 from 65,000 in the same period. In Travis County, which includes Austin, the population increased more than 26 percent, to 727,000 from 576,000.</p>
        <p>''It's just phenomenal,'' said Ryan Robinson, Austin's demographer. ''We're in the top tier of the top tier for population growth, and things like this cemetery encroachment issue are undoubtedly symptoms of that growth.''</p>
        <p>Every two minutes, another acre of Texas farmland is converted into houses, shopping malls or roads, according to a study released in December by the United States Department of Agriculture. Statewide, 1.22 million acres were developed in the years 1992 to 1997, the equivalent of nearly 2,000 square miles, the study reported.</p>
        <p>Squeezed between suburban growth and the trend toward highly mechanized farming, cemeteries are suffering, Mr. Hite said. ''Our cemeteries' boundaries get smaller every year because of encroachment from agriculture and suburban development.''</p>
        <p>Laws governing the protection of cemeteries vary around the country, but particularly in Texas, ''the laws are old, antiquated and convoluted,'' Mrs. Thompson said. She described a scene reminiscent of the movie ''Poltergeist,'' in which developers built a subdivision over an Indian burial site.</p>
        <p>''In less than 30 minutes a bulldozer can shove all the gravestones into a nearby creek or ravine and clear the site,'' Mrs. Thompson said. ''Under Texas law, that's just a misdemeanor and no one's ever prosecuted. It's a felony if they disturb the bodies, but they don't. They just leave them there and build over them.''</p>
        <p>And there are other problems, Mr. Hite said.</p>
        <p>In older cemeteries, boundaries may not be clearly marked; and headstones may have disappeared or become long since overgrown, making it difficult to know how far even identified burial sites stretch.</p>
        <p>At times, the issue can have racial undertones. In many old cemeteries, headstones marking the graves of white residents were made of stone, while those marking the graves of black or Hispanic residents were wood, and quickly deteriorated.</p>
        <p>''If you don't even know where something is, how do you protect it?'' Mr. Hite asks.</p>
        <p>As more people have abandoned farming, entire towns have died, Mr. Hite said, leaving only the graveyard to mark the community's existence.</p>
        <p>''We should know better than to do this,'' Mrs. Thompson said. ''All of these people who went on before us should have their histories recorded and protected, not paved over for a Wal-Mart.''</p>
