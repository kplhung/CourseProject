        <p>ONCE, THESE were tests for military men on horseback. Now, the riders are usually civilians and often women, and age is no barrier. The four riders on the American jumping team are women, ages 42, 40, 34 and 23. The United States eventing team includes David and Karen O'Connor, husband and wife from The Plains, Va., who won team silver medals in 1996.</p>
        <p>THE SETUP -- The three disciplines -- jumping, dressage and eventing -- award individual and team medals. In jumping, horse and rider race one by one over a stadium course of 15 to 18 jumps, with fastest time (combined with fewest faults) deciding. Dressage is seven minutes of ballet on horseback, with the horse doing required moves in response to invisible commands from the rider. Eventing combines separate days of cross-country riding over 35 to 40 jumps, dressage and show jumping.</p>

        <p>ONCE, THESE were tests for military men on horseback. Now, the riders are usually civilians and often women, and age is no barrier.

        <p>THE SETUP -- The three disciplines -- jumping, dressage and eventing -- award individual and team medals. In jumping, horse and rider race one by one over a stadium course of 15 to 18 jumps, with fastest time (combined with fewest faults) deciding. Dressage is seven minutes of ballet on horseback, with the horse doing required moves in response to invisible commands from the rider. Eventing combines separate days of cross-country riding over 35 to 40 jumps, dressage and show jumping.</p>
        <p>THE STRATEGY -- Especially tricky in eventing because the horse would be worn out if it always took the shortest route over the jumps, which may be higher in the middle. So beforehand, coaches and riders walk the course over and over, trying to determine the smartest line.</p>
        <p>THE NAMES -- Gold-medal favorites are Rodrigo Pessoa of Brazil in jumping, Isabell Werth of Germany in dressage and Blyth Tait of New Zealand in eventing. The best teams are Brazil and Germany in jumping, Germany and the Netherlands in dressage and the Netherlands and the United States in eventing. The Americans have good shots at one or two medals in eventing and a medal in jumping from Margie Goldstein-Engle of Wellington, Fla.</p>
