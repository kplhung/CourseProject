        <p>The Giants were pleased after their opening-game victory over Arizona last week. Yesterday, they were satisfied that they had beaten a superior opponent. No unit was more relieved than the offensive line, whose members admitted last week that they had not been truly tested.</p>
        <p>The veteran Lomas Brown, one of three newcomers on the line, warned that it was too early to judge the rebuilt unit.</p>
        <p>''This was a sterner test,'' Brown said, noting that the Eagles were playing their home opener.</p>
        <p>The line was not perfect. It allowed one sack -- as defensive end Hugh Douglas got around Brown -- and was fortunate Collins survived and excelled under the Eagles' pressure. Collins completed 21 of 29 passes without being intercepted. And after committing one penalty in the opener last week, the line was penalized three times yesterday.</p>
        <p>Right tackle Luke Petitgout was penalized twice, including an illegal-motion call in the first quarter that turned a fourth-and-1 play at Philadelphia's 34-yard line into a punting situation. Brown, in his 16th year, made the other penalty when he was whistled for a false start on third-and-6 in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>Montgomery Idle Again</p>
        <p>Running back Joe Montgomery again did not dress for the game. Giants Coach Jim Fassel said Montgomery would need to show he could handle special-teams play last week in practice. He apparently did not. Craig Walendy was the backup fullback and played on special teams.</p>
        <p>As expected, safety Sam Garnes (concussion) and tight end Pete Mitchell (knee) were inactive.</p>
        <p>Men in White</p>
        <p>The Giants wore their white jerseys for the second week in a row, although it was not originally planned. The Eagles were going to wear white in their home opener before a logo on the sleeves faded in the laundry. Philadelphia was forced to wear green and the Giants improved to 2-0 in their white jerseys.</p>
