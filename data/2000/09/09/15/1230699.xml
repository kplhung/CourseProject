        <p>For almost a decade, Dwight Gooden would wake up each morning, get out of bed and twist his right arm around and around like a windmill. Gooden wanted to know how much tightness or pain he would have to endure to throw a baseball that day. He accepted this ritual as part of being a major league pitcher.</p>
        <p>But the 35-year-old Gooden does not test his arm before brushing his teeth anymore because it feels much looser and much better than it has since he was in his 20's. Gooden has made a stunningly successful comeback with the Yankees this summer by developing a changeup under Billy Connors's tutelage, by pitching more aggressively and by adjusting to a new role as a relief pitcher.</p>
        <p>Still, one aspect of Gooden's return that has mostly been overlooked is how he has improved his range of motion and the velocity on his pitches through a cutting-edge type of muscular therapy. Gooden's shoulder has been strengthened because his muscles have been lengthened following treatment with a therapeutic robot called a Therbo Robot.</p>
        <p>Less than a week after the Tampa Bay Devil Rays released Gooden on May 25, he went to see Al Meilus of Meilus Muscular Therapy and Sports in Pinellas Park, Fla. Jeff Ciszkowski, a former minor league pitcher who had undergone treatment with a Therbo Robot after a back injury, had implored Gooden to try it.</p>
        <p>''The first time I heard about it, I was like, 'Come on. What's that?' '' Gooden said. ''But then I got released and I was just begging for anything. I was out of baseball, so I didn't have anything to lose.''</p>
        <p>Meilus, a former electrical engineer who developed and patented the Therbo Robot, told Gooden how overworked muscles produce lactic acid and can lose their ability to cleanse themselves. That can cause a collection of waste and make the muscles stiff. The Therbo Robot helps the exhausted muscles by eliminating waste from the tissue, instituting normal blood flow and allowing the muscles to stretch back to their normal length.</p>
        <p>Meilus told Gooden that he could never throw his best fastball if he could not straighten his arm out at the elbow because he needs to lift his arm behind his head to get full leverage. More leverage translates into more power and more speed.</p>
        <p>''This pulls the muscle to lengthen it back to its original state,'' Meilus said. ''This lets the muscle do what it wants to do.''</p>
        <p>Gooden had more than a dozen treatments before rejoining the Yankees in June and quickly noticed a difference in how much flexibility his arm had. After throwing fastballs at 87 or 88 miles an hour while he was with the Devil Rays, Gooden said that he hit 93 and averaged from 89 to 91 in his last appearance for the Yankees. The results, which Gooden noted are predicated on making precise pitches, are striking. Gooden was a combined 2-3 with a 6.63 earned run average for Tampa Bay and Houston, but he is 4-1 with a 3.04 E.R.A. for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''Dwight told us that his arm hadn't felt like this since he was 19,'' Meilus said. ''He was like a kid with a new toy.''</p>
        <p>There are about 600 Therbo Robots around the country, but most of them are in private homes, and Gooden grudgingly went without a treatment while pitching the last two months.</p>
        <p>Meilus flew from Tampa to New York with a portable machine last Wednesday, set it up in Gooden's Midtown hotel room and treated the shoulder. The robotic arm measured the muscles, the measurements were inserted into a computer and then the arm moved across Gooden's shoulder. The arm applied very precise and very controlled pressure to lengthen the aggravated muscles, which sets off a reaction to initiate the healing process.</p>
        <p>Gooden has already scheduled his next session with Meilus when the Yankees play Tampa Bay in 11 days and said that he will continue to be treated by the Therbo Robot for the rest of his career.</p>
        <p>''Just doing this doesn't mean I throw the ball wherever I want to,'' Gooden said. ''But it's just like working out. This is another thing that can help get me to the level that I want to be.''</p>
