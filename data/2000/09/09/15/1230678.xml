        <p>Rick Lazio, the New York Senate Republican nominee, was supposed to be the likable candidate. Then this week, at a debate in Buffalo, the Congressman morphed into a political predator. Darth Vader with dimples. A suburban Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Long Island Lex Luthor. Richard Hatch with clothes on.</p>
        <p>We're getting carried away. As did Mr. Lazio. He called Hillary Rodham Clinton ''shameless,'' and invaded her space, stalking across the stage waving a campaign finance pledge. When a question about her husband's affair with Monica Lewinsky left her looking as if she'd had the wind knocked out of her, Mr. Lazio eagerly piled on with a verbal kidney punch.</p>
        <p>Now this is a guy who's supposed to be romancing the suburban women voters. People, how many times do we have to point out that women do not like men who yell? This is the cardinal law of modern American politics, not to mention modern American life. Why do you think the Republicans nominated George W. Bush? Why is Al Gore spending so much time hanging around Joe Lieberman? It's because they are non-yell guys. (Dick Cheney does not generally raise his voice, but he always looks as if he wants to.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has got to know all this. But perhaps he feels he's so puppy-like, no one will notice he's been  gnawing away on Mrs. Clinton's ankle.</p>
        <p>The debate began really well for the Congressman, whose mission was to show that he had some gravitas. He seemed aggressive, but not, you know, crazed. Mrs. Clinton was so much on the defense that at one point she resorted to saying that Mr. Lazio had ''chutzpah,'' a word that Midwestern Methodists should really try to avoid. She kept monotonously invoking Newt Gingrich. If the Clinton campaign were into subliminal advertising, all the footage of Mr. Lazio would be interrupted by pictures of a small salamander.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lazio turns out to be one of those politicians with no thermostat. Having started hot, he just got louder and louder. By the end, he had charged over to Mrs. Clinton's lectern and thrust a no-soft-money pledge under her nose, demanding: ''Sign it! Right now!''</p>
        <p>The most dramatic point in the debate came when the moderator, Tim Russert, replayed Mrs. Clinton's ''Today'' show interview in 1998, the one where she assured the nation that her husband had not had sex with that woman. Mr. Russert asked if she regretted ''misleading the American people.''</p>
        <p>All of us have moments in our lives that we prefer not to recall even while cowering in a darkened closet. Mrs. Clinton's just happens to be stored in the files of every news bureau on the planet.</p>
        <p>After watching Mr. Russert's tape, she looked as if she had been sideswiped by a truck. This is a woman who delivers off-the-cuff remarks in long sentences filled with perfectly conjugated dependent clauses, none of them dangling. Her answer to Mr. Russert's question, however, contained 23 ''um's'' along with several ''you know's.'' The gist of it was that she had trusted her husband, who lied to her and then let her hang herself, on camera, during morning drive time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio was invited to respond, giving him an excellent opportunity to say something like ''Tim, let's go back to that great point I made about health care a few minutes ago.'' Instead he piled right on, accusing Mrs. Clinton of ''blaming others every time you have a responsibility.'' (When it comes to finding a scapegoat for anything relating to the Lewinsky episode, the president seems like a really excellent choice.)</p>
        <p>The Lazio campaign has bought into the Clinton theory that Hillary wins if the race becomes about issues. But the Congressman was actually doing fine when he was attacking her record on health care and education reform in Arkansas. The truth is that Mrs. Clinton wins if the race is about her marriage, and loses if we wind up arguing about the success of the Little Rock school system.</p>
        <p>But New York is a land of many great traditions, one of which is that our big Senate races should be very, very fierce battles that wind up focusing with laser-like intensity on something utterly meaningless.</p>
        <p>It's not the town meeting, but, you know, we make do with what we have.</p>
