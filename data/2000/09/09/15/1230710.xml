        <p>A fleet of 10 Internet-enabled taxis hit the streets of New York yesterday in a venture between Yahoo; Team Systems, a large taxi fleet operator; and Medallion Financial, which provides loans for taxi operators. The purple and yellow taxis, with purple upholstery, are equipped with Palm hand-held computers, offering passengers access to the Internet at no extra cost. ''This will be a great opportunity for taxi passengers to stay on top of their business and personal lives while riding in the comfort of a taxicab,'' said Andrew Murstein, president of Medallion Financial. The venture, which follows a similar effort by Yahoo in San Francisco, is part of a trend by many companies.</p>
