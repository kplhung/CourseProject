        <p>Britain's ill-starred state-owned nuclear fuel company, BNFL, reported heavy losses for a year clouded by scandal over the falsification of quality control data on shipments of nuclear fuel. In what the company called ''poor results'' for the year ended March 31, pretax profit fell from $:218 million ($307 million), to a loss of $:337 million. BNFL, which has contracts for a range of nuclear decommissioning projects in the United States through its Westinghouse subsidiary, said it was unlikely to proceed with plans for a partial privatization until late 2002.</p>
