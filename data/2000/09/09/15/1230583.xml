        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.  ++ means discounted tickets were available at the TKTS booth for last Friday night only.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT'' (Tony winner for best musical, choreography and featured actor and actress). The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly un related vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer leading performances from Deborah Yates and the Tony winners Boyd Gaines and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical, it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form as ''Contact'' weaves romance from a reality we are all familiar with (2:00). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $85 (Ben Brantley).</p>

        <p>*+ ''COPENHAGEN'' (Tony winner for best play, director and featured actress). Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be such electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (the Tony-winning Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $65; $25 student rush at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''DIRTY BLONDE.'' Stand up, boys, and take your hats off. Mae West is back on Broadway in this compact Rolls-Royce of a vehicle written by and starring Claudia Shear. Eight decades after a play with the forthright title ''Sex'' landed her in jail, West is proving that she still has the power to shock and delight. She has also, not incidentally, provided the inspiration for what is hands down the best new American play of last season. This tale of an icon and two of her idolizers (played by Ms. Shear and Tom Riis Farrell) is no evening of mere impersonation; it's not ''Mae West Tonight!'' What Ms. Shear and her director, James Lapine, have shaped is a multilayered study of the nature of stardom. Bob Stillman rounds out the protean three-member ensemble (1:45). Helen Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $65 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*++ ''KISS ME, KATE'' (Tony winner for best musical revival, director of a musical, musical actor, costumes and orchestration). A mouthwatering revival, with ham as the plat du jour, of Cole Porter's sybarite's delight of a musical about battling egos in show business. As presented by a preening cast led by the wonderful Marin Mazzie and the Tony-winning Brian Stokes Mitchell, who wear a spotlight as if it were a dressing gown and vice versa, this ''Kate'' proves that ham can indeed make a banquet if the spices are zesty enough. Avoiding the attitudes that are anathema to lively revivals of vintage musicals -- reverence and condescension -- the director Michael Blakemore and the choreographer Kathleen Marshall have shaped a show that is broad, brazen and finally irresistible. The production, which doesn't seem to have a thought in its giddy head beyond entertaining us as much as it is entertaining itself, feels like one long ear-to-ear grin (2:20). Beck, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $29 to $84 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER.'' This revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's 1939 farce, starring Nathan Lane in a role famously modeled on Alexander Woollcott, feels busy without being lively. Under the direction of Jerry Zaks, the production seems to exist in neither the then nor the now. Much of the acting is a series of flourishes that sell individual jokes without being anchored to character or context. And Mr. Lane, looking like a cuddly, Mattel-made Sigmund Freud doll in his beard and spectacles, never quite comes up with a coherent performance; it's as if he is still experimenting with his options. Tony Walton's richly colored set is a showroom-perfect evocation of period style that fits nicely into the newly restored American Airlines Theater (formerly the Selwyn). But the evening's most authentic glimpses into a vanished era of madcap celebrities are provided by Lewis J. Stadlen, in a character inspired by Harpo Marx, and Byron Jennings, as a charming Noel Cowardesque narcissist. Unfortunately their appearances onstage feel as brief and brilliant as lightning (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $70, half-price for children 18 and under (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*++ ''THE MUSIC MAN.'' A show that makes you feel ridiculously happy one instant and seriously sleepy the next. The director and choreographer Susan Stroman, who created the inspired dance-musical ''Contact,'' isn't as confident in her take on Meredith Willson's jubilant story of a traveling con man who brings rhythm to the stolid town of River City, Iowa. Her transforming imagination stops when the music stops. The production has two perfectly agreeable stars in Craig Bierko, in the title role, and Rebecca Luker, as the frosty librarian who learns to melt. But you get the impression that most people onstage are just pretending to live in a land of corn-fed propriety and corny jokes, marking time until a production number comes along to let them show their stuff. When the show is singing or, especially, dancing, it often seems to have winged feet; when it's just talking or clowning around, those feet are flat (2:50). Simon, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>++ ''THE CRUMPLE ZONE.'' This new play by Buddy Thomas is uneven, but it has a lot going for it: a nicely structured plot about a gay household with a love triangle coming to crisis at Christmastime, sequences of physical comedy that are antic without being overblown into slapstick and an effective set that evokes a pleasantly chintzy apartment on Staten Island. Most of all, though, it has a bristling, funny performance by Mario Cantone, who plays the squeaky wheel, a clamorously lonely man on the outside of the triangle looking in. Mr. Cantone is known for his high-pitched stand-up comedy work, and he knows how to take over a room. In this case the room is a tiny apartment, but he works it as a diva would. He is the kind of actor who seems most in control when he's in a tizzy, with a voice that easily and naturally runs up to shrill. But this is not a shrill performance. Even in high dudgeon there's no tension in Mr. Cantone's face or his body language, no sense of Method acting when he's working up to a fever pitch, just the wicked glee of a man who loves to seize the spotlight. The magnitude of his neurotic charisma in such a small space gives his character the hilariously keening pathos that makes the play work (2:00). Rattlestick, 224 Waverly Place, near West 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 206-1515. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $39 to $45 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>''IT AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT THE BLUES.'' This slick musical revue, a Tony nominee in 1999, has been slimmed down to a supper-club-brisk 80 minutes in its new cabaret home, but its strength remains in its high spirits and the marvelous voices on display. The six performers are the happiest blues singers you'll ever see -- it's thematic that the show begins and ends with ''Let the Good Times Roll'' -- and each brings a full throat and a flawless sense of pitch to standards like ''I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man,'' ''I Put a Spell on You'' and ''I Can't Stop Lovin' You'.'' Show-biz values keep things cheerful and the performers on a strict leash, and as a result longtime blues fans may miss the music's mordant spirit, its down and dirty heart. There's a blues-lite feel to the evening that wouldn't suit a roadhouse, but it's perfectly apt here: the blues for the new Times Square (1:20). B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Weber).</p>
        <p>''RICHARD II'' AND ''CORIOLANUS.'' Unlike many movie stars, Ralph Fiennes doesn't shrink as a presence onstage. Indeed, those who know him largely through his subtle, inward work on film may be jolted by the brazenly exterior performances he is giving as Shakespeare's most peevish tragic heroes in these productions from the Almeida Theater of London. The actor's signature moodiness is certainly in evidence, but stylized, enlarged and spotlighted, as if part of some public monument. His energy, charisma and command of language are formidable. But while you know what he's trying to convey -- the signals go off like flares -- you don't necessarily feel it. The productions themselves, staged by Jonathan Kent, are strong in their pacing and accessibility, and crisply register Shakespeare's vision of the harsh vagaries of politics. But deeper interpretive revelations are faint, as is any sure emotional grip. The productions engage your interest, but they don't hold it captive. The supporting cast notably features Barbara Jefford, who is magnificent as a dragon of a Roman matron in ''Coriolanus'' (3:10 each). Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (212) 307-4100. ''Richard II'': Sept. 16, 19, 20, 23, 26, 27, 30 at 7:30 p.m.; Sept. 17, 24, Oct. 1 at 3 p.m. ''Coriolanus'': Sept. 15, 21, 22, 28, 29 at 7:30 p.m.; Sept. 16, 23, 30 at 1:30 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $75; very limited. Returned tickets will be available at the box office 90 minutes before curtain (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>''SPINNING INTO BUTTER.'' Everyone is talking about race these days. But who's talking to whom, about what and why? Rebecca Gilman's play turns these questions into a tense farce set on a Vermont college campus filled with self-congratulation about its commitment to diversity. Commitment turns to crisis when a black student starts receiving racist letters. Can the administration find the culprit, confront the moral issues and turn a crisis into a public-relations coup? Talk may be cheap, but its consequences are lethal. Hope Davis is excellent as the most emotionally complex of the administrators. Daniel Sullivan's direction is too brash, and Ms. Gilman is struggling with the balance between force and subtlety. The play is worth seeing, though. This is the stuff theater should be spinning, churning and beating into art (2:00). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Through tomorrow. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Margo Jefferson).</p>
