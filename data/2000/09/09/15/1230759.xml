        <p>At first light today, Greg Norman, one of the best-known Australian athletes, accepted the Olympic torch in the middle of the Sydney Harbor Bridge as the torch relay began its final 12 hours of a 100-day journey to tonight's opening ceremony.</p>
        <p>Norman walked the flame a mile across the bridge, mobbed by golf fans and other spectators who had gotten up at dawn to see their hero carrying a symbol rather than a driver.</p>
        <p>Norman, who is now based in Florida, got so much into the patriotic spirit of the moment that he told reporters who tagged along that he might move his family back to his native Brisbane. He says also that he will push for golf to become an Olympic sport.</p>
        <p>The torch arrived in Sydney on Thursday afternoon, landing on Bondi Beach, Australia's signature surf center.</p>
        <p>Phil Coles, 69, one of Australia's two members of the International Olympic Committee, jogged 300 yards on the white sand carrying the Olympic torch.</p>
        <p>For Coles, it was the last lap of his redemption from a 1999 scandal in which the I.O.C. censured him as a freeloader and a disloyal gossip. Too many free visits to Salt Lake City, and providing organizers of its successful bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics with candid comments on the foibles of some influential I.O.C. voters, landed Coles, a former canoe champion, in hot water.</p>
        <p>Recently forgiven by his fellow I.O.C. members and cheered on by 20,000 people enjoying 70-degree temperatures and Pacific breezes, Coles on Thursday relished the role of the prodigal. Holding high the torch, and rowed to the mile-long beach in a surf boat whose five-man lifesaver crew caught a good last wave, Coles said, ''This is a wonderful feeling -- my biggest thrill.''</p>
