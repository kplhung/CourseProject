        <p>It is a windowless, unmarked room on the third floor of an office building across the street from Madison Square Garden. The shabby office, five flights down from Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign headquarters, is scattered with desks, computer terminals, televisions, hanging cable wires and telephones. There is at least one campaign official posted there 24 hours a day, monitoring the television news, wire services, newspapers, the Internet and, ultimately, the campaign activities of Representative Rick A. Lazio.</p>
        <p>At the direct request of Mrs. Clinton and one of her longtime advisers, James Carville, the signature campaign tactic that helped President Clinton win the White House has quietly found its way to the campaign for Senate in New York. Mrs. Clinton has opened what in 1992 was called a war room by Mr. Clinton's advisers, though her aides this time have pointedly declined to use that name, because it might remind voters of what some consider an unseemly side of the Clintons.</p>
        <p>Whatever it is called, the result is a political boiler room teeming with about a dozen people who research Mr. Lazio's background and record,  write Mrs. Clinton's policy pronouncements and, most important, seek to influence the news coverage of Mrs. Clinton's campaign for Senate, mostly through an insistent barrage of e-mail messages intended to advance the first lady and undercut Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton asked that it be created after her campaign was engulfed for three days in July by a charge that she voiced an anti-Semitic slur against a former colleague in 1974,  and Mrs. Clinton's aides debated how to deal with publicizing her denial.</p>
        <p>Howard Wolfson, who had been Mrs. Clinton's ubiquitous spokesman and who is an advocate of aggressive and fast-paced politicking, was dispatched from the eighth-floor headquarters to run the operation with Neera Tanden, the campaign's policy director.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, standing outside a diner in South Buffalo where Mrs. Clinton was greeting voters, Mr. Wolfson could be heard on his cellular phone overseeing the production of a ''Debate Scorecard'' that compiled newspaper reports on voter reactions to the Senate debate on Wednesday, in an effort to show that some viewers thought that Mrs. Clinton had won. The, um, whatever room -- ''Well, it's not a peace room,'' Mr. Wolfson said archly -- had the scorecard in reporters' e-mailboxes before lunch, when the campaign calculated that reporters were making judgments about post-debate articles.</p>
        <p>For a campaign that has been criticized by Democrats for being factionalized and as slow as an ocean liner (her visit to a diner in South Buffalo this morning was arranged 12 hours earlier), the war room has emerged for many Democratic leaders as a model of efficiency and, they hope, ruthlessness.</p>
        <p>And it has prompted Mr. Lazio to step up his own rapid response operation, which he put on strong display at the debate. Although it is not as concentrated or intense as Mrs. Clinton's, it took the art of response to a whole new level Wednesday night. It fired off 10 e-mail messages, offering a running rebuttal of Mrs. Clinton's remarks to reporters, many of whom were online during the debate. (''False Clinton Charge: At 7:17 p.m., Hillary Clinton claimed Rick Lazio voted to cut 100,000 police,'' one of the messages announced, proceeding to offer evidence to the contrary.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfson, who is intensely competitive, reacted glumly upon learning about Mr. Lazio's high-tech operation. He noted that Mrs. Clinton's campaign had managed to get a response out to Mr. Lazio's debate performance before the candidates even walked into the studio. It was called a pre-buttal edition.</p>
        <p>This is, in truth, more than a matter of games that campaign consultants play. There are some implications that are broader than the efficiency of both candidates in getting out their positions and undercutting their opponents.</p>
        <p>Candidates tend to benefit when the public -- and, not insignificantly, other politicians and the news media -- perceive that they are running a strong, confident campaign. Until the  debate on Wednesday, Republicans were raising questions about the competence of Mr. Lazio's campaign.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, Mr. Lazio's aides took issue with the notion that his  campaign was not as nimble as Mrs. Clinton's. ''Let's put it this way: We have an operationally very tight campaign, and we have a big room with desks in it,'' said Mike Murphy, Mr. Lazio's senior campaign consultant. ''But we don't go around having to call it a war room and trying to make ourselves feel good about ourselves.'' He mocked the Clinton effort as ''lots of people high-fiving each other and towel-snapping and feeling really good about themselves while Rome burns.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mrs. Clinton's advisers were wary of drawing too much attention to the operation, for fear that it would underline the Clintons' reputation of being bellicose. Mr. Carville, in particular, has written the book on the war room -- or, more precisely, the movie, since the one he set up with George Stephanopoulos in 1992 was the subject of a documentary. He even set one up in Israel when he served as consultant to Ehud Barak when Mr. Barak was elected prime minister in 1999.</p>
        <p>''The War Room has become sort of a trademark,'' Mr. Carville said yesterday, discussing its latest incarnation in New York. ''We needed a way to get things out quickly.''</p>
        <p>The Hillary Clinton campaign, Mr. Carville said, ''was small-d democratic. And in a democracy, autocratic campaigns work better than a democratic campaign. You can notice the difference.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, there have been several instances when the work of the war room has shaped the daily flow of the campaign. There is, on one wall of the room, a blow-up of a Daily News headline that reads, Lazio Tax Plan Doesn't Add Up. It is, in effect, a testament to what Mrs. Clinton's aides view as one of their bigger accomplishments: within two hours of Mr. Lazio's offering up his tax plan, Ms. Tanden prepared a detailed response that used Congressional cost estimates to argue that he was drastically understating its cost. That assertion was backed up by a number of critical newspaper and magazine articles.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mrs. Clinton's aides were visibly relieved on Tuesday night when the primary returns showed that Mrs. Clinton had won 82 percent of the vote over an unknown challenger, Mark McMahon, a Manhattan surgeon. A double-digit showing by an unknown challenger could have been seized by Mr. Lazio as evidence of Mrs. Clinton's unpopularity even among New York Democrats.</p>
        <p>However, the war room, as part of its daily procedure, monitored interviews that Bill Dal Col, the Lazio campaign manager, gave to small radio stations upstate. In one of those interviews, Mr. Dal Col made the offhand observation that Mrs. Clinton would be in trouble if her primary opponent got 30 percent or more, a generous prediction that would surely have been lost had Mrs. Clinton's aides not made sure to share that particularly high number with any reporter writing a story on the race.</p>
        <p>The most visible edge of the effort is the use of e-mail. On any given day, the two campaigns dispatch a dozen e-mail messages each, spotlighting negative information about the opponent, or highlighting some new proposals about each campaign. In a sort of political incarnation of ''Spy vs. Spy,'' both campaigns have managed to sneak their way onto their opponent's e-mail list -- aides to Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton declined to reveal how, or what address they were using -- which guarantees an even faster and more furious exchange.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing to me how much everything has changed since 1998 because of e-mail,'' said Michael Marr, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio who worked for George E. Pataki's reelection campaign. ''Now everything is e-mail. This is a cycle where e-mail has both defined and changed things.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's pollster, Mark Penn, said tonight that the upsurge in e-mail was just one of a number of factors that led the first lady's staff to conclude it was time to do in New York now what Mr. Clinton did in Little Rock in 1992. ''There is going to be a lot of stuff coming over the transom, and not just from Lazio,'' Mr. Penn said.</p>
