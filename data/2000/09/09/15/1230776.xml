        <p>In New York City, the number of private-sector jobs fell by 11,400 last month, according to an analysis by the city comptroller's office, which adjusts the figures for seasonal factors.

        <p>The number of people working in New York fell sharply in August, but government economists attributed most of the decline to striking telephone workers.</p>
        <p>In New York City, the number of private-sector jobs fell by 11,400 last month, according to an analysis by the city comptroller's office, which adjusts the figures for seasonal factors. But if it had not been for the temporary loss of 17,800 jobs because of the strike against Verizon, formerly Bell Atlantic, the job count would have risen. Government jobs declined for the third month as census workers were laid off.</p>
        <p>For the state as a whole, the strike caused a net loss of 8,100 jobs in the private sector, bringing to a halt a 14-month string of employment gains, according to the New York State Department of Labor.</p>
        <p>Unemployment rates rose by 0.3 percentage points for both the city (to 5.8 percent) and the state (4.5 percent), but remain well under their levels of a year ago.</p>
