        <p>Fresh from their contentious first debate, the Senate candidates today continued firing at one another -- from a distance -- as they sought to capitalize on the momentum they both claimed from their encounter Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, who embarked on a four-city swing through western and central New York, defended his televised challenge to Mrs. Clinton to sign a pact against the use of unregulated campaign contributions known as soft money. Pictures of Mr. Lazio approaching Mrs. Clinton and brandishing a slip of paper emerged as one of the debate's enduring images, featured prominently in television news segments and on the front pages of morning newspapers.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, after greeting patrons at a Buffalo diner this morning, called Mr. Lazio's actions a stunt and belittled him, saying it reminded her of dealing with her two younger brothers. ''You just sort of say, 'Well, that's fine, but now let's talk seriously about what we're going to do today and how we're going to get it done.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio made no apologies for his tactics in the debate, brushing aside complaints from debate organizers that he had violated a rule against using props. ''The only person who violated the rules was Mrs. Clinton by not agreeing to what she said she was going to do, a ban on soft money,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>He also defended his aggressive manner. ''People expect plain talk,'' Mr. Lazio told reporters in Buffalo before beginning his bus trip, one of several planned in the coming weeks as he steps up his campaign schedule amid talk from some party leaders that he has had a lackadaisical pace lately. ''And you can't take the high horse and then take the low road,'' he said. ''If you fire at me, you're going to have to expect to get fired back at.''</p>
        <p>Dan McLagan, his communications director, promised more verbal warfare. ''This isn't high tea,'' he said. ''It's the Senate race in New York, and New Yorkers want someone who will fight for them.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's senior advisers said Mr. Lazio may have helped them with particularly competitive voting blocs. They contended that people, especially women, saw Mr. Lazio's aggressiveness as a form of bullying that he would not have carried out against a man. ''It just backfired,'' one adviser said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio rejected that assertion tonight after speaking to dairy farmers near Syracuse, saying that his treatment of Mrs. Clinton was meant only to demonstrate the force he would bring to debates in the Senate. ''You have got to stand up when you are in the Senate,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''No one is going to care if you are a man or a woman.''</p>
        <p>Even children, it seemed, paid notice to his style in the debate, as Mr. Lazio discovered during one of his stops, at a new charter school in Rochester. Mr. Lazio, in a speech on education earlier this week, called for allowing parents more options to choose schools for their children, including charter schools, which are public schools given wide latitude from local board regulation.</p>
        <p>During his visit to the Charter School of Science and Technology today, a second grader asked him: ''Why were you fighting against Mrs. Clinton?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio responded, ''Last night we were on TV and were talking about different things.''</p>
        <p>Victoria Fagan, a second grader who said she had watched the debate with her father, asked, ''Did you expect her to sign that paper?''</p>
        <p>''I really, really did,'' Mr. Lazio replied, seated on a child's chair and leaning toward his questioner, ''and I still do.''</p>
        <p>The candidates are to meet Oct. 8 for another debate; they are negotiating the possibility of a third encounter.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Lazio began his day receiving endorsements from three Hispanic organizations in Buffalo. He went on to the school, then to a campaign rally here. He planned to end the day talking to farmers in Cazenovia, near Syracuse, and to campaign on Long Island on Friday  and upstate again over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, after her visit to the diner, flew to New York City to attend a fund-raiser at Radio City Music Hall with Vice President Al Gore. On Friday, she plans her first joint campaign appearance with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice presidential nominee and someone she is counting on to shore up support from Jewish voters.</p>
