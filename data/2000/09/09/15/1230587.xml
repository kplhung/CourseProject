        <p>Morgan Freeman knows how to give people the fisheye. When you say something a little unexpected or maybe even a little silly (as people sometimes do when in the presence of, say, a celebrity or one of the country's finest actors), he will cock his head slightly and look at you out of the corner of his eye. Like: Say what? And then, if you're lucky, he'll break into a broad laugh.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeman was sitting in the bar at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles one recent afternoon, doing interviews for the two films he has coming out this month and nudging along his dream project of making a big-budget adaptation of Arthur C.

        <p>Morgan Freeman knows how to give people the fisheye. When you say something a little unexpected or maybe even a little silly (as people sometimes do when in the presence of, say, a celebrity or one of the country's finest actors), he will cock his head slightly and look at you out of the corner of his eye. Like: Say what? And then, if you're lucky, he'll break into a broad laugh.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeman was sitting in the bar at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles one recent afternoon, doing interviews for the two films he has coming out this month and nudging along his dream project of making a big-budget adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's ''Rendezvous With Rama,'' a project that has attracted the interest of the director David Fincher.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeman is already in theaters as the principled hit man chasing Renee Zellweger in ''Nurse Betty.'' But he is even more eager to talk about ''Under Suspicion,'' a small film, set for limited release next Friday, that comes out of his own production company. He will be paired, once again, with one of his ''Unforgiven'' co-stars, Gene Hackman.</p>
        <p>The film is based on ''Garde a Vue,'' a 1981 police thriller by Claude Miller that was critically and financially successful in France, where it is regarded as a minor classic. In it, a police detective spends a long night interrogating a very successful local lawyer who may or may not be a murderer. It's all bluff and mind games and steely eyes contemplating one another in the harsh glare of an interrogation room. Mr. Freeman plays the detective, Mr. Hackman the prosperous suspect.</p>
        <p>''It happened right here, in this hotel,'' Mr. Freeman said. ''I bumped into Gene in the lobby, and he told me he had this project he was interested in and that he had a tape he wanted to show me. I said sure, and he sent me the tape.''</p>
        <p>It was the Claude Miller film.</p>
        <p>''We talked later and he asked me if I was interested, and I said yes, and then he asked which part I wanted to play,'' Mr. Freeman said. ''I told him, oh, I wanted to play the detective, and he said that's good because he wanted to play the lawyer. Sometimes it works out.''</p>
        <p>The problem, Mr. Freeman said, is that it was a small movie. ''And in this town, right now, you cannot go to a big studio with a small movie,'' he said. ''All they want to make are big movies. Summer blockbusters. No mayhem, no money.''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Freeman decided to take on the project for his own fledgling production company, Revelations Entertainment, raise the money himself, hire a director (Stephen Hopkins), shoot it and then find a distributor, which is just what happened.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeman said he was particularly gratified when the film was shown at the Cannes International Film Festival this year and Mr. Miller appeared at the post-screening news conference and said he considered it a better film than his. ''I don't think it's a better film, personally,'' Mr. Freeman said. ''I think it's a different film. I have a big thing about remakes. I don't think they're worth anything unless you give them something new, unless you make them different. Otherwise, it's just another pillaging of French cinema by Hollywood hacks.''</p>
        <p>Against the Odds</p>
        <p>Peter M. Cohen sees himself as a success story of independent filmmaking, someone whose story should give hope and encouragement to other young filmmakers out there flying on a wing and a credit card. But he's afraid that, with one thing and another, that's not how his story is coming across.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen produced, wrote and directed a movie called ''Whipped,'' which opened over Labor Day weekend on about 1,500 screens. It stars Amanda Peet as the object of affection, if that's the word, of a group of not altogether admirable Manhattan men. The movie drew some fairly harsh reviews and earned only $2.7 million in its opening weekend, not even finishing in the top 10.</p>
        <p>''I won't say the box office wasn't disheartening, compared to the marketing, but I am still proud,'' Mr. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>What people don't seem to realize, he said, since the movie all but vanished in an eye-blink, is that it wasn't the studio film that it might have appeared from its marketing campaign. ''The total cost to make this movie was $180,000,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''That's it. I raised the money myself from 36 private equity investors. My whole hope was not so much to get released as to just go to some festivals, get a little attention, maybe get myself an agent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen made the movie as ''kind of a hobby''; his full-time job is as a producer with a major Manhattan advertising agency. ''Most of the characters were first-time actors, high school or college friends of mine,'' he said. ''If you gave me $1,000, you got to be in the movie; you got to walk through the frame.''</p>
        <p>It was never intended to be a Hollywood film, he said: ''Originally, it was going to be a short. It only grew into a feature as we were making it. It was always supposed to be a character-driven piece more than a plot-driven piece. It was never supposed to be more than it was.''</p>
        <p>He shot it in 15 days in Manhattan and tried to get it into the Sundance Film Festival in January, but it wasn't accepted. So rather than continuing to try to interest festivals, Mr. Cohen and his new agent decided to do some distributor screenings in Los Angeles -- to show the movie directly to studios and independent distributors in hopes of making a direct sale. The odds against this are great, but they showed the movie around Hollywood, and a week later Destination Films made an offer for the domestic rights and Intermedia for the foreign rights.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, he said, it was a Hollywood film.</p>
        <p>Destination mounted an aggressive marketing campaign, and the movie went out over Labor Day.</p>
        <p>And died.</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''I was actually happy. I mean, they told me the movie had made $2.7 million. This is a movie that cost me $180,000 to make. This was just me and a bunch of my friends running around New York with a camera. I thought, 'This is great.' ''</p>
        <p>But in the reality of Hollywood perceptions, with bad reviews and a disappointing box office ($2.7 million is not great for 1,500 screens, no matter how much the movie cost), he is worried that ''Whipped'' will never be seen as anything positive. And it bugs him.</p>
        <p>''It should be an inspirational story,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''The guy who came from nowhere and decided to make a movie, and it ended up on 1,500 screens. But it's not being seen that way. I don't know. I'm still proud. I made something from nothing.''</p>
