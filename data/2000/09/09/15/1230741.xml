        <p>''On the Run'' may have been fun to write, fun to direct and fun to act in. But it is a sore trial to sit through.</p>
        <p>To accept this bleak comedy as a black comedy requires not only a suspension of disbelief but also a willingness to noose it expertly and drop it through a gallows trapdoor with a thud.</p>
        <p>In Bruno de Almeida's feature film, from a screenplay by Joseph Minion, whose credits include ''After Hours,'' the two principal characters behave with a consistent illogic that seems born not so much of character or circumstance as of filmmaking whim.</p>
        <p>Louie (John Ventimiglia), who manages to just walk out of prison with two weeks left on his five-year sentence for attempted robbery, hides from the police behind a newspaper at one point while waiting in what he calls the Port of Authority bus terminal in Midtown Manhattan. But once outside, he exults at the top of his lungs, and in the course of a seemingly endless night with Albert (Michael Imperioli), his boyhood pal and partner in juvenile crime, he scarcely displays the sense of a man who is determined not to attract the attention of the police in an effort to remain free.</p>
        <p>After touching off a scuffle in a Times Square porn house, he creates an uproar in a nearby bar by stuffing a $20 bill in a lush's bra, instigates a conversation with two police officers, steals Albert's wallet and runs off to another bar where the police are attracted to yet another brawl, scales a fence at 2 a.m. and invades a yacht because he insists Frank Sinatra is on board singing. And after attracting the attention and gunfire of a pack of goons, Louie flees, only to force himself on a woman he remembers as a sympathetic member of the jury that sent him away.</p>
        <p>Louie, who must have had plenty of company in the slammer, insists that he just doesn't want to be alone. And while Mr. Ventimiglia works hard at his portrayal, Louie's humor runs steadily downhill after he takes one look at the new Times Square and pronounces it disgusting.</p>
        <p>As for the nerdy Albert, a travel agent who has never been anywhere, his first impulse when he receives a call from the pal he hasn't seen for nine years is to tell the police. As he sensibly tells Louie later, ''I will not go to jail for you.''</p>
        <p>But overcome with remorse, Albert hustles down to the bus terminal, whisks Louie away and withdraws $160 from a teller machine to help him get out of town. Time after time, when Albert's (and a logical viewer's) reason say it is time to bid Louie an irrevocable farewell, ''On the Run,'' which opens today at the Screening Room (54 Varick Street, TriBeCa), concocts another misadventure.</p>
        <p>Albert and Louie quickly prove to be extremely monotonous company.</p>
