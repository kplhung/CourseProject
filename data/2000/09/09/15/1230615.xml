        <p>In the surreal opening sequence of Carlos Saura's visual knockout of a film, ''Goya in Bordeaux,'' a bull's carcass in a field of red dirt mysteriously begins to twitch. Gradually stirring to life, it drags itself across the ground and hangs itself on an outdoor meat rack that resembles a gallows. As this raw hunk of flesh and bone is stretched to the breaking point on cables, a chalky human face begins emerging from its exposed rib cage and is revealed to be that of the 18th-century Spanish painter Francisco Goya.</p>
        <p>These jarring images, like everything else in the biographical montage created by a filmmaker renowned for his bold visual flash, are anything but gratuitous. They forcefully conjure up the spirit of Goya, who died in exile in Bordeaux, France, portraying him as an unstoppable bull of a man and an artistic visionary whose greatest work fearlessly locked horns with the darkest human truths.</p>

        <p>In the surreal opening sequence of Carlos Saura's visual knockout of a film, ''Goya in Bordeaux,'' a bull's carcass in a field of red dirt mysteriously begins to twitch. Gradually stirring to life, it drags itself across the ground and hangs itself on an outdoor meat rack that resembles a gallows. As this raw hunk of flesh and bone is stretched to the breaking point on cables, a chalky human face begins emerging from its exposed rib cage and is revealed to be that of the 18th-century Spanish painter Francisco Goya.</p>
        <p>These jarring images, like everything else in the biographical montage created by a filmmaker renowned for his bold visual flash, are anything but gratuitous. They forcefully conjure up the spirit of Goya, who died in exile in Bordeaux, France, portraying him as an unstoppable bull of a man and an artistic visionary whose greatest work fearlessly locked horns with the darkest human truths.</p>
        <p>Immediately after this spectacular flourish, the movie follows Goya (Francisco Rabal), who has either returned from the dead or is in a premonitory limbo, as he rises from his bed in a nightshirt and dazedly stumbles through a ghostly corridor that leads him into the streets of Bordeaux. The very next scene finds him back in bed attended by his adoring and worried young daughter Rosario (Dafne Fernandez), to whom he recounts his life and times in passionate feverish bursts.</p>
        <p>The life he evokes is a gorgeous, sensuously pulsating montage of mental pictures in which the 82-year-old artist looks back, and ruminates brusquely, on love, art, history, politics and the sadness of the human condition. (Humans are worse than animals, he declares, because they're aware of the harm they're doing.)</p>
        <p>As the movie goes along, it becomes a fitful dialogue between the ailing octogenarian and his younger, mid-40's self (Jose Coronado). It was at that age that Goya nearly died from a mysterious illness that left him permanently deaf and prone to excruciating headaches. His recovery coincided with an artistic turning point that found him embracing rougher, more realistic subject matter, culminating with his unblinkingly horrific series of engravings, ''The Disasters of War.''</p>
        <p>It's not meant disparagingly to describe ''Goya in Bordeaux'' as a movie so ferociously red-blooded that at moments it threatens to slop off the screen. In such earlier films as ''Flamenco'' and ''Tango,'' Mr. Saura and his brilliant collaborator, the cinematographer and lighting genius Vittorio Storaro, became so intoxicated with their subjects that they splashed their visual ideas on the screen as if they were throwing  buckets of paint. ''Goya in Bordeaux'' explodes with the same sense of unbounded (and occasionally repetitious) visual exuberance.</p>
        <p>Many of the film's tableaus are staged re-creations of well-known Goya paintings. In one stunning visual coup, a painting of Goya's greatest love, the fiery Duchess of Alba, flashing what seems to be the evil eye, comes alive and turns into an angel of death, casting an ominous shadow that creeps across Goya's face until he musters enough strength to cast off her spirit. Maribel Verdu, a charismatic actress who radiates danger  and a wild, hot-blooded sensuality, plays the Duchess who, Goya confides to his daughter, was poisoned to death by the jealous Spanish queen, Maria Luisa, in cahoots with the royal secretary Godoy (Jose Maria Pou), who was the lover of both women.</p>
        <p>''Goya in Bordeaux'' tosses together fragments of history, fantasy, biography, gossip and art appreciation into a blend that, despite a lack of narrative drive, coheres through the sheer vividness of its imagery and the bluntness of its dialogue. But there are moments, especially near the end, when the film seriously overreaches.</p>
        <p>In the most ambitious and problematic sequence, the Catalan action-theater group La Fura dels Baus  re-enacts the 17 engravings that make up ''The Disasters of War'' as an extended dramatic pantomime while Roque Banos's film score strains to evoke the kind of epic tragedy expressed in a Shostakovich symphony.</p>
        <p>Although the actors in horror-movie makeup strike the right visual poses, the troupe's lack of acting skill undercuts the emotional force of  Goya's imagery, and the effort conveys the clumsy earnestness of an elaborately produced high school pageant.</p>
        <p>''Goya in Bordeaux'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some gory images and some blunt dialogue.</p>
