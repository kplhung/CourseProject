        <p>On a typical weekday a bus may be only a means of getting to work. But tomorrow, in Brooklyn at least, it will be much more: a nostalgic vehicle to transport you back to your childhood and to offer today's youngsters an extraordinary ride.</p>
        <p>This magical travel comes courtesy of the New York Transit Museum, which will hold its eighth annual Bus Festival both above and below ground. Visitors can tour old-fashioned buses along the street, and step down into the museum itself in a decommissioned subway station.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the old buses have wicker or soft vinyl seats,'' said Roxanne Robertson, the museum's director of special projects. ''The interior configurations are marked by differences from one bus to another, and people can come find out why.''</p>
        <p>The buses the museum plans to display include a 1948 model called the Jackie Gleason, the type his character Ralph Kramden drove in the television series ''The Honeymooners''; a 1956 Mack bus, the first to be built with large double doors; and a 1917 Fifth Avenue Coach bus, a double-decker and the museum's oldest.</p>
        <p>The museum also hopes to feature an unusual driver: Maisy, the mouse heroine of the children's books by Lucy Cousins. If Maisy's schedule permits, she will read from her new adventure, ''Maisy Drives the Bus.'' Kurt M. Resch, the author of ''A World of Bus Toys and Models,'' will also visit.</p>
        <p>The buses of the future won't be neglected, either. Children can attend demonstrations on transit science and create their own designs at ''Build a Bus'' workshops. Although their models will be paper, they just might pave the way for the next generation's high-tech commute.</p>
        <p>Bus Festival, tomorrow from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., rain or shine, on Schermerhorn Street between Court Street and Boerum Place, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 243-8601. Admission (including museum): $5; children, the elderly, members, and Transit Authority employees, $2.</p>
        <p>Big on Reading</p>
        <p>Mitchel Fried would like to see more children get lost in books. So he's helping them to do it -- literally.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fried, the senior vice president for marketing for the Golden Books Entertainment Group, developed the Big Little Golden Books Read In, a traveling literacy event. It will be in the New York area this weekend and next, inviting families to wander through huge reproductions of book pages and Web pages.</p>
        <p>''I have 'Pat the Bunny,' '' Mr. Fried said, referring to a popular children's classic. ''I blew it up life-size and made it interactive.'' Like the book, the walk-in site will have tabs to pull and panels to touch.</p>
        <p>The festival will also allow visitors to enter an enormous computer outfitted with panels illustrating the Web site www.finditquick.com, which offers homework help.</p>
        <p>Children can do more literary browsing via a life-size board game. Called ''The Road to Reading,'' it takes the form of a highway that runs from simple picture books to chapter books. ''When they land on a box, it will have a reading assignment, a writing assignment or a chance to act something out physically,'' Mr. Fried said.</p>
        <p>Families can also enjoy entertainment on a smaller scale, but with big names. Tomorrow the author Carol Higgins Clark and the former Met Keith Hernandez will read, and today and tomorrow Mallory Lewis, the daughter of the puppeteer Shari Lewis, will perform a 10-minute musical in which the puppet sidekick Lamb Chop learns how to read. Then Lamb Chop will demonstrate her skill, no doubt upstaging all the human celebrities.</p>
        <p>The Big Little Golden Books Read In, today from 4 to 6:30 p.m., tomorrow from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. in front of Borders Books and Music, 231 Airport Plaza, Farmingdale, N.Y., (631) 752-0339, and Sept. 22 to 24, at the same times, in front of Toys 'R' Us, Route 10, Livingston, N.J., (973) 252-1488. Free.</p>
        <p>The Night Life</p>
        <p>This weekend the Brooklyn Children's Museum is inviting young visitors to observe some evening stars -- not the ones that shine in the dark, but the ones that leap, creep and soar through it.</p>
        <p>''We'll create a darkened room with a CD of night sounds,'' said Patricia Hulse, the museum's natural science program developer. ''They'll get little flashlights to get an up-close experience with a raccoon, an opossum, owls, moths, frogs and bats.''</p>
        <p>Although these animals will be taxidermy specimens, the museum will also show live snails, crickets, worms and cockroaches, and Rosie, a tarantula. (All except Rosie can be handled.) They will be in ''Creatures of the Night,'' a drop-in workshop teaching children to love the dark, or at least its wildlife.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing how each animal has its own little niche to survive,'' Ms. Hulse said. The staff will discuss nighttime adaptations like owls' keen vision and bats' echolocation. Creatures like cockroaches favor the dark because they can avoid predators, Ms. Hulse said -- or, in New York apartments, stomping feet.</p>
        <p>All the children will assemble a take-home booklet about night creatures. They can also return next weekend for ''Easy as 1, 2, 3.'' This workshop will find fun in another intimidating subject: math.</p>
        <p>''Creatures of the Night,'' tomorrow and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m., and ''Easy as 1,2,3,'' Sept. 23 and 24 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., at the Brooklyn Children's Museum, 145 Brooklyn Avenue, at St. Mark's Avenue, Crown Heights, (718) 735-4400. Free with suggested contribution: $4.</p>
