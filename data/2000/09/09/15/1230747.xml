        <p>The latest cases were in the Bronx and in Bay Shore, Suffolk County. The man in the Bronx, Jose Pena, complained of nausea and burning in his throat after drinking from a bottle of Aquafina water bought from a vending machine at a Getty gas station on Bruckner Boulevard, where he works as an attendant, the authorities said.

        <p>As two more people in the region were hospitalized after drinking bottled water yesterday, city officials said that they had not revealed three earlier incidents until this week because the cases had been regarded as isolated.</p>
        <p>The latest cases were in the Bronx and in Bay Shore, Suffolk County. The man in the Bronx, Jose Pena, complained of nausea and burning in his throat after drinking from a bottle of Aquafina water bought from a vending machine at a Getty gas station on Bruckner Boulevard, where he works as an attendant, the authorities said. Mr. Pena, who was gagging and clutching his stomach, according to a witness at the gas station, went to Jacobi Medical Center. He was released late in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Officials from the police and the F.B.I., who interviewed Mr. Pena, were investigating whether the bottled water was contaminated and, if so, whether it was a result of tampering. Last night, the police took fingerprints from the vending machine and confiscated several bottles of soda, bottled water and cleaning supplies from the gas station. They also tested 36 bottles of Aquafina remaining in the machine.</p>
        <p>In the Bay Shore case, Marvin Aguilar, 30, told the police that he felt a burning in his mouth and an upset stomach after drinking from a bottle of Poland Spring water that he  bought at a 7-Eleven on Brentwood Road yesterday, the Suffolk County police said. Mr. Aguilar, of Lindenhurst, was treated at Southside Hospital and released, the police said.</p>
        <p>The bottle that Mr. Aguilar drank from will be tested by the police. All the Poland Spring water in the store was turned over to the authorities.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's cases bring to five the number of people in the metropolitan region who have gotten sick after drinking bottled water since Aug. 3.</p>
        <p>''I was going to buy some water, then I thought, 'This is probably some disgruntled employee,' '' said Paul Giovino, shopping at a corner bodega in Brooklyn. ''You take a chance when you walk across the street around here; now you have to take a chance to buy the water.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who on Wednesday announced the three incidents that occurred between Aug. 3 and Sept. 6, said the contamination was not made public earlier because ''we were analyzing the information.''</p>
        <p>''We had information from three different sources,'' he said, referring to the Police Department, the F.B.I. and the city's Health Department. An official said the F.B.I. was notified of the three cases last Friday.</p>
        <p>Sandra Mullin, deputy commissioner of the Health Department, said it was only recently that the authorities determined that the contaminants in the three confirmed cases were similar.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mullin described two of the contaminants as ammonia and sodium hydroxide; health officials still do not know the identity of the third contaminant, she said, although it had a similar alkalinity to the others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani urged bottled-water drinkers not to overreact. Store and restaurant owners said customers were asking more questions about the bottled water, but there was no evidence that people were turning en masse to tap water.</p>
        <p>''Let's not get people more excited than they have to be,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''I think we should emphasize that this is not brand specific, we've had three different brands involved in the four reported cases. At this point it is too early to tell what kind of trend or exactly what is going on.''</p>
        <p>No one has died from drinking the contaminated water. In the most serious case, on Aug. 3, a woman was hospitalized for several days after she began bleeding from her mouth when drinking a glass of Perrier sparkling water at a Manhattan restaurant. The other incidents involved Poland Spring and Aquafina brands.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for PepsiCo, which produces Aquafina, said the company did not know about the contamination problem until Mr. Giuliani held a news conference Wednesday night at Gracie Mansion. The spokesman, Larry Jabbonsky, said the company is cooperating with the authorities.</p>
        <p>''We have had no other calls of this nature before or since,'' Mr. Jabbonsky said. ''Zero consumer complaints about Aquafina.''</p>
        <p>Jane Lazgin, a spokeswoman for the Perrier Group of America, which owns both Perrier and Poland Spring, said the company was informed of the contamination problem shortly after the Aug. 3 incident involving the bottle of Perrier. Kim E. Jeffery, president of Perrier Group, said in a written statement that the company has ''examined our manufacturing and delivery processes and found no evidence to suggest that the contamination occurred in our processes.''</p>
