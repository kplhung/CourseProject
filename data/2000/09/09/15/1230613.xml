        <p>BY image-obsessed Western standards, one picture is worth, absolute minimum, a thousand paltry words. But in China, where words are images, writing has traditionally been the highest art form of all, and a source of profound political and emotional power.</p>
        <p>To see this power art in action, check out ''The Embodied Image: Chinese Calligraphy From the John B. Elliott Collection,'' the grand survey of calligraphic material that opens today at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Head straight to the middle of the show, the long room in the Chinese painting galleries devoted to the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). Look around, and just see what you see.</p>
        <p>What you won't see are landscapes or still lifes or figure paintings, at least not more than a few. In their place are dozens of scrolls, vertical and horizontal, covered with handwritten words, that collectively suggest a gathering of vivid personalities and radiate the equivalent of cocktail party conversational buzz.</p>
        <p>A smallish hand scroll with a fastidious ink-and-brush script, for example, brings to mind visions of an uptight court functionary. A larger scroll with gangly tumbling-about characters seems self-confident, and very ''on,'' maybe a little high on something. A hanging scroll in the corner, with columns of loops and smears, seems to be giving off agitated vibes. You can almost hear the mutterings of righteous defiance and dashed hope in a voice veering out of control.</p>
        <p>One can project meanings on practically anything of course. But control -- as in, you need to have it to lose it -- really is the binding ingredient in this extraordinary visual talk-a-thon. Almost every specimen here is the product of arduous training. Each written character is infused with the energy of generations of writers physically shaping language to gain personal fame, to link up with the past and above all to say what they want to say.</p>
        <p>What they say must remain somewhat conjectural to anyone who doesn't read Chinese -- the Met supplies translations for only a few of the texts -- which is why viewers are often encouraged to think of calligraphy primarily in formal terms, as a kind of Asian version of American postwar action painting, in which the artist's stroke was assumed to reveal his psyche. If this analogy gets you into the calligraphic groove, great. And while you're there, go back to the show's opening gallery for a chronological view of how this phenomenon came to be.</p>
        <p>Beginning with ritual inscriptions going back to the Shang dynasty (16th to 11th century B.C.) writing seems to have been a tool of social dominance in the hands of an elite. After the invention of paper, the ancient seal and clerical scripts were joined by styles known as running and cursive, which caught the movement of the individual hand. The emphasis on touch brought strict standards of virtuosity, and writing as art was born, replete with an exclusionary mystique, a market, a still-flourishing trade in forgeries and a lineage of geniuses.</p>
        <p>The first and most enduring of these was Wang Xizhi (A.D. 303-361), routinely referred to in textbooks as one of the most influential Chinese artists who ever lived. The running script he developed, poised but springy and personable, provided a template for most of what followed. Writers defined themselves as much by rejecting his example as by adhering to it, and his ''Preface to the Orchid Pavilion'' was endlessly copied.</p>
        <p>None of his original works are known to survive. But his writing does, in the form of ink rubbings lifted from stones, and a tiny number of paper tracings, one of which is a centerpiece of the show. Titled ''Ritual to Pray for Good Harvest,'' it's just a scrap of a letter mounted on a scroll, but it has the aura of a relic. Seals of owners and admirers float over its surface. The two columns of Wang's traced script are flanked by proprietary comments by one long-winded emperor and the renowned Ming artist Dong Qichang. The work itself is now part of the John B. Elliott collection at Princeton University.</p>
        <p>If Wang was the canonized founder of the classical writing tradition, it reached an aesthetic peak in the Song dynasty (960-1279). Entries from this period -- an exquisite transcription of a Buddhist sutras, a fan inscribed with a poem by the emperor Gaozong, masterpiece hand scrolls -- are the exhibition's high points.</p>
        <p>The inventive artist Huang Tingjian is represented by two superb scrolls. In one he kvetches about his health -- his stomach aches, his feet hurt -- though the quavers in his ink strokes are the result of his adamant brush technique rather than infirmity. In the other, ''Biographies of Lian Pou and Lin Xiangru,'' he works in a fleet, airy, improvisatory style known as ''wild cursive,'' inspired by a famous eighth-century model by the monk-artist Huaisu that Huang actually saw early in his career and that traveled to the Met two years ago in ''Splendors of Imperial China.''</p>
        <p>The other luminary here is Mi Fu, a live-wire artist and antiquarian referred to as Crazy Mi in his day. Examples of his writing are rare, and the Met owns a gem in ''Poem Written in a Boat on the Wu River,'' an autobiographical travelogue enlivened by calligraphic special effects.</p>
        <p>The narrative bops along in jazzy, syncopated cursive rhythms up to the point where Mi's boat runs aground and he hires a gang of laborers to haul it back to deep water. He compares the shout they give when they finally dislodge it to a battle cry, and he turns the character for battle into a space-clearing wiry snarl that punctuates the text like a Roy Lichtenstein ''Blam!''</p>
        <p>Although both Huang and Mi played daringly with the sacrosanct Wang model, orthodoxy reasserted itself during the the Yuan dynasty (1260-1368) in the person of Zhao Mengfu, an artist who ended up having almost as much long-term clout as Wang himself.</p>
        <p>Zhao arrived at a tense moment. China was under Mongol rule. Many artists, adhering to a Confucian ethos of imperial loyalty, retreated from public view. Zhao, who was related to the defeated Song royal family, chose to work for his new overlords, which infuriated many of his peers but did wonders for the continuing history of Chinese art.</p>
        <p>He represented an ideal version of the art-for-art's-sake scholar-painter, and different facets of his complex achievements and personality flash out in the show. His transcription of a monastic history is an official document meant to be copied as a stele carving. It's written in a stately version of standard script created by Zhao and adopted by the Yuan court as its house style.</p>
        <p>Another scroll nearby finds him in the role of art historian with a retelling of anecdotes from the life of Wang Xizhi that affectionately channel that master's spirit. And in a private letter to his Buddhist spiritual adviser, Zhao writes in a tremulous hand about his crushing grief at his wife's death. Together, these documents do more than flesh out a brilliant career; they suggest the public and private ends to which calligraphy can be turned.</p>
        <p>In the adjoining gallery that Ming party is still in full swing. Like many fledgling dynasties, the Ming asserted political legitimacy by supporting time-honored tradition, and it was very calligraphy-friendly at first. But this was a hybrid, promiscuous age, much like our own. Social and cultural categories were blurring and art of all kinds was in circulation, from high-polish dandified fluff to agitprop.</p>
        <p>Political discontent gained force with the rise of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), and one senses it in a hanging scroll by the Ming loyalist Fu Shan. A doctor by profession, he refused to deal with the Manchu government and, as a ''leftover citizen'' he donned the robes of a Daoist priest. His ''Poem on the Heavenly Emperor,'' done in ink on satin, suggests a fantastic, neurotic aria of wishful thinking, incorporating bits and pieces of archaic script into a baroque play of graphic trills and runs.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, the Manchus adored China, everything about it, especially its art. The proprietary imperial colophons on ''Ritual to Pray for Good Harvest'' were written by a Qing emperor, and the dynasty sponsored extensive archaeological digs to recover ancient stones and bronzes. As a result, archaic scripts had a major revival. Their presence in the scrolls that conclude the show, a few of them produced in the early 20th century, brings the calligraphic saga full circle.</p>
        <p>And the story isn't over. True, the repressions of the Cultural Revolution and the global spread of digital technology have given calligraphy the status of a leftover art in China today. But it is still practiced in its traditional form, and young, innovative artists are both deconstructing and, perhaps, reclaiming it, as one saw in ''Inside Out: New Chinese Art'' at the Asia Society in Manhattan in 1998.</p>
        <p>Calligraphy was everywhere in that show, though in offbeat guises. For example Xu Bing, who now lives in New York, cooked up a customized East-West script through computer programming. Another emigre in New York, Gu Wenda, ''wrote'' a pseudo-seal script in strands of human hair. Wu Shan Zhuan, now living in Europe, covered a room with quotations from classical poetry, Buddhist scripture, Maoist tracts and advertising, so that competing spiritual and social orthodoxies canceled one another out. Finally the Beijing Conceptualist Qiu Zhijie copied Wang's ''Orchid Pavilion Preface'' 1,000 times, but on a single sheet of paper, so the hallowed text ended up a solid mass of black ink.</p>
        <p>Their work has little chance of finding its way into a mainstream survey like ''The Embodied Image,'' which was organized by Cary Y. Liu and Robert E. Harrist for the Art Museum at Princeton University last year and has been expanded to twice its original size in New York by Maxwell K. Hearn, curator of Asian art at the Met.</p>
        <p>Yet the very fact that such art is being made suggests that the polarities that have propelled calligraphy all along -- conservatism and innovation, political manipulation and personal expression -- are still in play. This amazing art form may still feel a bit unapproachable to the Western viewer. But any attempt to get to know it is well worth the effort, and the Met makes persuasive introductions in this stimulating icebreaker of a show.</p>
