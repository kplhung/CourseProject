        <p>The Clinton administration moved today to reopen peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians at an informal working level in New York, but Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright played down prospects that progress would be substantial enough to lead to an accord in the near future.</p>
        <p>''The discussion will continue, and we will pursue the same agenda that we have been pursuing, fully aware of the fact that time is short,'' Dr. Albright said. She spoke at a news conference at the United Nations, after a working lunch with representatives of the European Union.</p>
        <p>''One thing we have learned is that the talks are moveable,'' she said, implying that they would be convened wherever there was any prospect of success. She stopped well short of saying what the United States would propose to narrow the gap in this new session.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright said the Palestinian senior negotiators, Saed Erakat and Muhammad Dahlan, had just arrived in New York and were meeting with Dennis B. Ross, who handles complex Middle East negotiations for the administration. And she said she was meeting the Israeli foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, separately.</p>
        <p>President Clinton made an all-out attempt in July to bring Prime Minister Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, together in the seclusion of Camp David to hammer out the framework of a peace agreement. But for all the displays of good will, the talks broke down when the two sides could not agree on the future of Jerusalem and, to a lesser extent, the fate of Palestinian refugees.</p>
        <p>Still, Dr. Albright said today: ''Camp David was a watershed. We started to talk about issues that were never talked about before.''</p>
        <p>In an effort to salvage the momentum of the Camp David meeting, Mr. Clinton held a new round of talks last week in New York, where Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat were attending a summit meeting at the United Nations.</p>
        <p>''The location I don't think is the issue,'' Dr. Albright said today. ''I think we're taking advantage that people are here.''</p>
        <p>So far, the administration has been unable to make visible new headway in suggesting new formulas for mutual compromise; in fact, some officials said the positions on each side had slipped since Camp David. But Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat pledged separately to keep the talks alive.</p>
        <p>Administration officials have said another Camp David meeting would be worth convening only if the two leaders appeared close to agreement.</p>
        <p>Still, after Mr. Arafat returned home, the Palestinian Central Council agreed to postpone a declaration of a Palestinian state that they had threatened to make if no progress was achieved with Israel by Sept.13.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright noted with some relief that that deadline had come and gone.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian postponement, she said, ''provided some breathing space for negotiations at a time that we will use very well in a variety of venues and in a variety of combinations.''</p>
        <p>Her reference to time growing short referred to January, when the Clinton administration steps down. Mr. Clinton hoped to cap his eight years in the White House with a Middle East peace agreement, a goal that is fast slipping away.</p>
        <p>The administration is also concerned about the political survival of Mr. Barak, who, after defections from his slender majority government, confronts the possibility of having to call a new election when the Israeli Parliament returns at the end of October. Progress in the peace talks would reinforce his claim to stay on as Israel's leader.</p>
        <p>The talks in New York could be moved, Dr. Albright said, if ''it's more a matter of where the critical mass of people is.''</p>
        <p>''I will obviously be deeply involved in them at the appropriate times,'' she said. ''And we'll be continuing to meet with one or the other side in the course of these talks.''</p>
        <p>Answering a question today about the emotional deadlock over the holy site in Jerusalem that Jews call the Temple Mount and Arabs call Haram al Sharif, Dr. Albright said ''there is a great deal of very imaginative work going on'' to make both Israelis and Palestinians feel their needs have been met.</p>
        <p>On the broader goal of a Middle East peace accord, she reiterated her contention that ''neither side can have 100 percent of what it wants, and we can't come out of this where one side feels that it has won and the other lost.''</p>
