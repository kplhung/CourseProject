        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>''BERLIN TO BROADWAY WITH KURT WEILL,'' Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 239-6200. If this is not a flawless revue, it is nevertheless an ingratiating tribute to Weill's achievement. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>JACKIE CAIN AND ROY KRAL, Firebird Cafe, 363 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 586-0244. Now in their 70's, the long-running husband-and-wife duo are still the exemplars of a comfortable jazz gentility that incorporates improvisatory vocal riffs into semiformal pop-jazz settings. The high points of their new show are three collaborations by Mr. Kral with the London-based lyricist Fran Landesman on songs that take a long ''senior'' view of life and its losses. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11. Cover: $30 plus $15 minimum. Also, Sunday at 6:30 p.m., Ann Hampton Callaway. Cover: $30 plus a $15 minimum. Sunday night at 9, Barbara Fasano. Cover: $20 plus $15 minimum (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>KAREN MASON, Arci's Place, 450 Park Avenue South, at 30th Street, (212) 532-4370. The high-strung likable performer from Chicago still exudes the effervescent eagerness of a hometown drama student who has just arrived in New York, bursting with starry-eyed ambition. Her new cabaret show concentrates on popular standards. High points include zany 60's cabaret numbers like Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh's ''When In Rome'' and Stephen Sondheim and Mary Rodgers's bossa  nova spoof, ''The Boy From . . . .'' But her big ballads are undermined by a tendency to  overbelt. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11; Sunday nights at 8; Wednesday and Thursday nights at 9. Through Oct. 15. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Also, on Sunday at 3 p.m. (brunch begins at 1 p.m.), Lynn DiMenna, singer, in ''It's De-Lovely, It's DiMenna!'' Cover: $25; $19.95 prix fixe brunch or $15 minimum (Holden).</p>
        <p>* MAUREEN McGOVERN, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 840-6800. Ms. McGovern's gorgeous voice and the melodies of Richard Rodgers were meant for each  other. The singer's demureness and sense of proportion prevent Rodgers and Hammerstein ballads like ''Climb Ev'ry Mountain'' and ''You'll Never Walk Alone'' from turning to mush. She brings a fine mixture of wit and precision to Rodgers and Hart standards like ''To Keep My Love Alive.'' Not only is the singer the closest American equivalent to Julie Andrews in her vocal prime, but she also adds a jazzy, coloratura panache. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30; Tuesday through Thursday nights at 9. Cover: $50, with dinner required for early shows on Fridays and Saturdays; $15 minimum for other shows; suggested dinner arrival for early show is 7. Through Oct. 14. Also, Sunday jazz brunch, at 2 p.m. (seating begins at 12:30 p.m.), Barbara Rose, singer. Cover: $50, includes brunch. International Festival of Cabaret: Sunday night at 9, Michel Hermon, singer; Monday night at 9 , Natalie Gamsu, singer; $40 cover and $15 minimum; Sundays and Mondays through October (Holden).</p>
        <p>LAURIE BEECHMAN THEATER, West Bank Cafe, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 695-6909. ''Jamie deRoy and Friends.'' The comedian and singer brings a blend of cabaret performers together. Saturday nights at 8:30 p.m. Cover: $20; one-drink minimum.</p>
        <p>CARNEGIE CLUB, 156 West 56th Street, (212) 957-9676. Cary Hoffman, with the 11-piece Carnegie Club Orchestra, plays music made famous by Frank Sinatra in the 1950's, featuring the original arrangements by Nelson Riddle. Friday and Saturday nights at 9:30 and 11. Cover, $20; two-drink ($15) minimum.</p>
