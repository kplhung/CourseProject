        <p>Concerns about rising unemployment, inflation and lawlessness in the southern islands of the Philippines badly hurt the country's financial markets today, sending the value of its currency to the lowest level since the depths of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98.</p>
        <p>As the government contemplates whether to use force against Muslim rebels who earlier this week conducted a second raid on a Malaysian resort in search of people to kidnap, investors seem to be losing their remaining faith in the ability of President Joseph Estrada's administration to ensure economic security. The benchmark stock index fell today to a five-week low, and the Philippine peso dropped at one point to its weakest level against the dollar in 32 months.</p>
        <p>''There's low confidence in the system,'' said Gary del Rosario, research chief at Salomon Smith Barney in Manila. ''It's getting out of hand.''</p>
        <p>Pressure is building on the nation's central bank to halt the peso's slide and keep inflation in check. Bank policy makers plan to meet on Friday to decide whether to raise interest rates a second time in less than a week.</p>
        <p>But analysts and economists worry that further rate increases may only dampen growth. Some are urging the bank to strengthen the currency's value by buying Philippine pesos with the nation's dollar reserves. The central bank governor, Rafael Buenaventura, denied rumors today that the bank was in fact selling dollars.</p>
        <p>Many economists remain confident that increasing exports will keep Philippine growth intact and that the latest pieces of bad news are not the beginning of a wider crisis.</p>
        <p>Investors are more skeptical. Also among their concerns is swelling government debt, with many expecting the government to report on Friday that it has already exceeded its deficit target for the year.</p>
        <p>In addition, the National Statistics Office reported today that despite continued economic growth, unemployment rose in July to 11.1 percent, up sharply from 8.4 percent a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Manila residents say gloom surrounds the economy, and rising oil prices are making matters worse. Mr. Buenaventura warned this week that higher prices for fuel and energy could stoke inflation and keep the country from meeting its target for economic growth this year of 4 to 5 percent. And in what could lead to a repetition of events in Europe, a militant group today threatened to blockade the country's three main refiners to protest rising gasoline prices.</p>
        <p>Manila's investment climate has also been undermined by persistent complaints of official corruption, including a still unresolved insider-trading scandal implicating a friend of President Estrada. In the latest ''corruption perceptions index'' compiled by an independent group, Transparency International, the Philippines ranked 69th of 90, behind India and China.</p>
        <p>Many investors are choosing to pull out of the Philippines. The central bank said on Wednesday that foreign investors had withdrawn more than $390 million from Philippine financial markets this year.</p>

        <p>Jakarta Exchange Closed</p>
        <p>JAKARTA, Indonesia, Sept. 14 (Dow Jones) -- The Indonesian stock exchange building, damaged by a car bomb, will be closed until Monday,  managers said. It is unclear whether the building's closing also means that trading of stocks in the JSX composite index will be suspended until Monday. Trading was halted on Thursday after the bomb killed 15 people and wounded dozens the day before.</p>
