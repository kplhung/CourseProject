        <p>One of the most anticipated matchups of the Olympic boxing tournament -- the American heavyweight Michael Bennett and the two-time Olympic heavyweight champion Felix Savon of Cuba -- will not take place in a gold medal bout. If Bennett and Savon advance through their first two preliminary fights, they would face each other in the quarterfinals Sept. 26.</p>
        <p>The blind draw for the event was announced Thursday, and while every other United States boxer was assigned a slot that made it impossible for him to face one of the dominant Cubans until at least the semifinal round, Bennett and Savon were put in side-by-side brackets.</p>
        <p>Bennett is the reigning world champion. Savon, the six-time world champion, declined to fight Bennett in last year's world championship as a protest against an earlier judging decision against a teammate.</p>
        <p>''It's not ideal but at least Michael doesn't have to fight him right off the bat,'' United States boxing coach Tom Mustin said of Savon. ''We'll get a chance to watch his first two fights and study the videotape of them. Otherwise, I thought the draw was pretty good for us. For the most part, it's given us a chance to catch our breath as things start.''</p>
        <p>The light flyweight Brian Viloria drew the Russian Sergei Kazakov in the first round. Viloria defeated Kazakov in a 1998 dual meet. But in the quarterfinals, Viloria could face Ivan Calderon of Puerto Rico, who upset Viloria this year. The super heavyweight Calvin Brock was handed the most rigorous early draw with top competition in two of his first three scheduled fights.</p>
