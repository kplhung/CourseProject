        <p>Until the current craze for golf brought the game into high visibility, everything I knew about golf technique I learned from a dancer: Fred Astaire. Astaire was a passionate off-screen golfer and in ''Carefree,'' his 1938 movie with Ginger Rogers, he included a golf solo for himself, to a tune by Irving Berlin. The choreography is built around two golf actions, the warm-up waggle and the swing, and its wit depends upon the conceit that an analogy can be made between a swing in golf and swing in jazz.</p>
        <p>In ''Carefree,'' Astaire plays what must be the most improbable psychiatrist in world cinema, with Rogers as his unanalyzable analysand. The setup for the golf solo is that he tries to impress her on the course after she teases him for pontificating in his office that one should be able to coordinate several actions at the same time. He whips out a harmonica and tap dances while he plays it, splicing in a pirouette from ballet. Crossing two irons, he performs a Highland sword dance.</p>

        <p>Until the current craze for golf brought the game into high visibility, everything I knew about golf technique I learned from a dancer: Fred Astaire. Astaire was a passionate off-screen golfer and in ''Carefree,'' his 1938 movie with Ginger Rogers, he included a golf solo for himself, to a tune by Irving Berlin. The choreography is built around two golf actions, the warm-up waggle and the swing, and its wit depends upon the conceit that an analogy can be made between a swing in golf and swing in jazz.</p>
        <p>In ''Carefree,'' Astaire plays what must be the most improbable psychiatrist in world cinema, with Rogers as his unanalyzable analysand. The setup for the golf solo is that he tries to impress her on the course after she teases him for pontificating in his office that one should be able to coordinate several actions at the same time. He whips out a harmonica and tap dances while he plays it, splicing in a pirouette from ballet. Crossing two irons, he performs a Highland sword dance.</p>
        <p>At one point he lines up several balls and, instead of wielding the iron he holds, he uses the side of his foot, in a hoofer's step called a wing, to hit each ball with a chip shot, taking one musical count for each stroke. Finally he picks up a wood, lines up more balls, and, again taking one musical count for each swing of the club, drives them, one after another  toward what the set design proposes is the deep space of the green. (He drives off Rogers, too. On the number's afterbeat the film cuts to the place she was standing and discovers that she has gone bicycling.)</p>
        <p>Pretty spectacular. Still, how good exactly was Astaire's golf swing?</p>
        <p>Recently I took a videocassette of ''Carefree'' to a New York pro, Joe Cowhick, at the indoor Richard Metz Golf School in Midtown Manhattan. Mr. Cowhick has taught golf for some 30 years, and his background includes experience on the P.G.A. tour, writing an instructional workbook and inventing various ingenious training aids.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cowhick's assessment of Astaire: ''He kept his swing short. He probably shot in the low 80's, maybe broke 80 on a good day. The average golfer shoots in the high 90's.''</p>
        <p>Infinite Patience</p>
        <p>Students of all ages and backgrounds study with Mr. Cowhick, whose faith in golf as a sport that almost anyone can learn sufficiently to enjoy makes him a teacher of considerable understatement and apparently infinite patience. He has shared the course with golfers who are blind (and rely on caddies specially trained to explain how their balls lie) and golfers who are multiple-limb amputees (and play golf with special devices that help them hold their clubs).</p>
        <p>At the Richard Metz school, lessons are conducted in netted cages, each with a target and a net at one end. An attentive listener can hear a spectrum of golfers' abilities without even watching the golfers: the very sounds of the clubs addressing the balls will tell you whether you're listening to a novice or a power hitter. When you do choose to watch, you're presented with two images, one live and one on video. Overhead cameras are positioned to focus on the full figure of each student, from the front and in profile. The pictures they record appear on a monitor nearby. Mr. Cowhick has taught  25,000 different video lessons at the school.</p>
        <p>I was curious to see how he would teach a beginner who didn't have any dramatic problems. After consulting some of his students, he invited me to sit in on two half-hour lessons with Melanie Englese, a 32-year-old dentist. These were her eighth and ninth lessons. Dr. Englese is petite (5-foot-2 and 95 pounds), but thanks to years of weight-training she addresses the ball with some power.</p>
        <p>She also peppers Mr. Cowhick with questions about everything from whether she can use a three wood on the fairway (''If you have a very good lie,'' Mr. Cowhick replied) to when she is likely to lower her average score. On this question Mr. Cowhick hesitated.</p>
        <p>''Come on, Joe,'' she said. ''I like numbers.''</p>
        <p>''You like numbers,'' Mr. Cowhick ruminated. ''That's a swing good enough to break 100 some day. If you have a short game. A short game to match the swing.''</p>
        <p>''I do have a good short game,'' Dr. Englese said. ''How long until I break 90?''</p>
        <p>''Depends on how dedicated you are,'' Mr. Cowhick replied. ''The dedicated golfer eats, sleeps and dreams golf.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Englese looked crestfallen for a moment: ''I have to sleep, eat and  dream dentistry.''</p>
        <p>At this point Mr. Cowhick noted that during an international championship for physically handicapped golfers, the winner, who was completely blind, shot a 91. ''On my course that would have beaten half the members,'' he added.</p>
        <p>A Happy Side Result</p>
        <p>After the lesson, Dr. Englese explained that although she took up golf because she liked it for itself, her study has also had the happy side result of permitting her to play the game with her beau, Casey Archer, a 32-year-old manager of a broadband communications company who is an avid weekend athlete. Despite a lifetime of extensive experience in team sports, he is also a golf novice. This summer he also took a couple of lessons -- his first in golf -- with Mr. Cowhick, whose assessment of Mr. Archer's golfing ability at this point is that he ''has above-average athletic coordination.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Englese keeps to a rule of her own when she plays with Mr. Archer, who currently always reaches the green far in advance of her. ''When he's playing with me,'' she said, ''I just pick up my own ball and move it, so I don't slow up his play.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Englese made her lessons look like so much fun that when the second one ended I hoisted myself out of my chair and asked Mr. Cowhick to analyze my stance as I took a few practice swings. He watched silently while I swiped at five or six balls. After the last one, he had a comment: ''Well, that's the most conventional swing you've done.''</p>
        <p>I've been on a golf course once. A few years ago I interviewed Jinx Falkenburg, now 81, who may be familiar to some readers for her golfing accomplishments (a legendary championship golfer on Long Island, she had a handicap of six at the peak of her career), for her tennis championships (her family of tennis champs includes her brother Bob, who won Wimbledon) or for her overlapping careers as a cover girl, a movie star and a journalist.</p>
        <p>Ms. Falkenburg had invited me to her home course on Long Island, at  the Creek in Locust Valley, to observe a tour of the first nine holes that she had masterminded for two of her closest friends. Her mission in this tour was to introduce the pleasures of the game to one friend, Fay Fraser, a novice whose preparation for playing golf had been a recent two-week crash course with her husband at the Stratton Golf School in Vermont.</p>
        <p>As a model and sympathetic partner for Ms. Fraser, whose major athletic experience before golf had been as a racing sailor with a side interest in tennis, Ms. Falkenburg brought in Cynthia Shogren, then the president of the Women's Long Island Golf Association. Ms. Shogren, who came to golf as an excellent tennis player, has a golf handicap that varies between 11 and 13.</p>
        <p>In pairing the two, Ms. Falkenburg did not intend to intimidate Ms. Fraser but rather to show her that, for a beginner in golf who has pluck, tenacity and heart, it is possible to play this game without the ferocious pressure associated with tournaments.</p>
        <p>Where to Aim</p>
        <p>In fact, Ms. Fraser kept up. On the first hole, where Ms. Shogren, according to the caddy, ''nuked'' the drive, so did Ms. Fraser. On the Creek's distinctively fast greens, it took Ms. Fraser only two or three holes to realize the caddy's advice that in these particular circumstances, one should not aim for the pin but rather play elliptically, to the side.</p>
        <p>At the formidable sixth hole, Ms. Shogren's abilities were unmatchable: her shot from the women's tee was perfectly aligned, landing on the fairway with the precision of a hatpin placed in a hat. Ms. Fraser had trouble here. On the seventh hole, where Ms. Shogren stood to watch Ms. Fraser drive, Ms. Shogren said evenly, ''I think she outdrove me.'' It was true: Ms. Fraser was improving her golf simply by playing it.</p>
        <p>Their play completed, we rounded a bend to the 10th hole, arriving at the idyllic arrangement of inlets crossed by a bridge, the creek at the heart of the Creek. Ms. Shogren explained that the water was tidal, with egrets and sometimes otters sighted  during games.</p>
        <p>I asked the players to sum up golf in a sentence or two.</p>
        <p>''I like what my husband says about it,' Ms. Shogren said. ''When I play golf with someone, especially in business, I see into his soul.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Fraser thought for a moment. ''Golf has a lot of structure, and it's  comfortable,'' she said. ''For a few hours, you don't have to bang through life. The secret is putting the ball in the hole.''</p>
