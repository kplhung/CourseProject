        <p>A beleaguered Olympic movement sought to sustain its viability and to shift its focus toward the possibilities of international brotherhood and the achievements of the world's greatest athletes as the 27th Summer Games open today in what is late winter in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
        <p>The 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium in this sports-mad country was sold out as 10,500 athletes from 199 nations readied to march in the opening ceremonies, viewed as a restorative, celebratory pageant that would deflect attention from the ominous threats of corruption, burdensome size and the perception that performance-enhancing drugs are used pervasively.</p>
        <p>Athletes from North and South Korea were scheduled to march together, a symbol of the hopes of reuniting the bitterly divided peninsula, and four athletes from East Timor were to march as individuals under the Olympic flag, granted special entry into the Games even though the embattled island has no independent government and no Olympic committee.</p>
        <p>Australia fielded the largest Olympic team, with 628 athletes, led by the flag bearer, Andrew Gaze, who played for Seton Hall University in the 1989 national collegiate basketball championship game. The United States had a contingent of 603 athletes, including the sprinter Marion Jones, who is attempting to become the first female track and field athlete to win five gold medals in one Olympics.</p>
        <p>Team competition has already begun, with the American women's soccer team winning Thursday night and the men's soccer team playing to a tie the night before. Individual competition will begin Saturday morning.</p>
        <p>Australia is expected to win its first gold medal in the triathlon and to follow with another victory Saturday night by the freestyle swimming sensation Ian Thorpe, who is 17 years old and wears a size 17 shoe. His large feet help propel him through the water like flippers.</p>
        <p>It is the hope of the International Olympic Committee, Sydney organizers, worldwide broadcasters and corporate sponsors, who have billions invested in the success of these Games, that spectators and television viewers will make a clear distinction between the revelations of official venality in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal and the remarkable performances that are certain to be achieved here in the pool and on the track.</p>
        <p>Steven Redgrave, the British rower, is attempting to become the first athlete to win gold medals in five Olympic Games. Alexsandr Popov, the Russian swimmer, is seeking to win the 50- and 100-meter freestyles for the third consecutive Summer Games, as is the Australian Kieren Perkins in the 1,500-meter swim event. One of the most poignant stories of the Games will involve Hicham el-Guerrouj, the Moroccan world record-holder in the 1,500-meter run, who is seeking redemption after falling with one lap remaining and finishing last four years ago at the Atlanta Games.</p>
        <p>For Australia, the Sydney Games will be presented to the United States and the rest of the world as a kind of travelogue, showcasing the Opera House, the crisply azure weather, along with the good humor and inestimable friendliness of the people.</p>
        <p>Australia's swimmers, who are the most popular Olympians, will be accorded rock-star status. And the attempt to win a gold medal by the world champion Cathy Freeman in the 400-meter run will bring attention to the plight of the Aborigines, Australia's indigenous people who have been marginalized by European settlers the past two centuries.</p>
        <p>Anger and indifference seemed to prevail among Australians as the Games approached. Both of the country's I.O.C. delegates have been compromised by scandal, Phil Coles for excessive travel and gift taking in the Salt Lake City episode, and Kevan Gosper for giving his daughter a preferred spot in the torch relay. Organizers were embarrassed by a ticket fiasco in which 500,000 of the best seats were withheld for corporate bigwigs. More than 1.5 million tickets remain unsold.</p>
        <p>But Sydney appears to be warming up for the Games. Ticket lines are long, school kids are out on Olympic holiday and the interlocking Olympic rings hang from the Harbor Bridge.</p>
        <p>As one of the only remaining connections that an ordinary person can have to the heavily commercialized Olympics, the torch relay has been exceedingly popular here. Photographs of each torch bearer have appeared in local newspapers and tens of thousands of people have showed up daily to watch the torch on its procession to the Olympic Stadium.</p>
        <p>''Ordinary people want to believe in the Olympics,'' said Richard Cashman, director of the Center for Olympic Studies at New South Wales University. ''They might think the officials are hopeless and crooked and greedy and arrogant, but they still get excited. The Olympics are part of Australian identity. People admire our best athletes as moral exemplars. I suppose this is the biggest event in our history. It's a quasi-religious festival; ceremonies like the torch relay and the lighting of the torch are very powerful.''</p>
        <p>Frequently isolated from the mainstream sporting world by distance, seasonal differences in the Southern Hemisphere and unfamiliar sports like cricket, rugby and Australian rules football, Australia for the first time since the 1956 Melbourne Games will play host to the largest multisport event on the planet.</p>
        <p>At the same time, that world stage is creaking under the burgeoning size of the Summer Games, a troublesome weight that threatens the manageability of the Olympics for any host city. Organizers recently needed a $140 million bailout from state government underwriters as sponsorship targets were not reached and the budget for the Sydney Games swelled to $1.8 billion.</p>
        <p>Sydney's transportation system will be groaning to deliver 50,000 people an hour -- as many as 500,000 total on the busiest days -- to Olympic Park, where the Olympic Stadium, pool, basketball and gymnastics arena and baseball stadium are located and where there is limited public space for moving around.</p>
        <p>Already, the public transportation system is struggling like Atlanta's did, with drivers unfamiliar with their routes and athletes missing training sessions because their buses were late.</p>
        <p>''I'd be deeply concerned about the economic model and how much stress it can take putting on the Games,'' said David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock Financial Services, one of a dozen worldwide Olympic sponsors.</p>
        <p>The weather will also play a significant factor in the success or failure of these Games. Strong winds have blown down electrical lines on the train system to Olympic Park, and have interfered with training at the rowing site; some races may have to be held single file instead of side by side, so boats do not knock into each other. Sprinters will be facing a stiff headwind at Olympic Stadium, which could preclude any world records in track and field.</p>
        <p>Further diminishing the credibility of athletic performances here is a deficiency in drug testing. A new test for the endurance-enhancing drug EPO will be used, but the test will only punish athletes caught using the drug in the previous three days. And there will be no tests for human growth hormone, insulin growth factor and artificial blood, doping that is believed to be widely used.</p>
        <p>So while the Olympics profess to be the purest form of sport, not a single performance at the Sydney Games will escape the cloud of suspicion caused by the use of performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
        <p>''It's a good first step, but I'd say we're only a third of the way there,'' said Gen. Barry McCaffrey, head of the White House drug policy office who is here to help monitor the drug-testing procedures.</p>
        <p>A successful Games will undoubtedly lift a sagging Olympic movement, while a failure could deal a punishing blow with the uncertainty of Athens's preparations for the 2004 Summer Games.</p>
        <p>''The desire on the part of Sydney is to make the Games fun,'' said Richard Palfreyman, a spokesman for the Olympic organizing committee. ''The pressure is on us to deliver a great Games that keep the Olympic movement running past Sydney.''</p>
        <p>SYDNEY 2000: THE OVERVIEW  Correction:  September 26, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Sept. 15 about the start of the Summer Olympics misstated the precedents faced by the rower Steven Redgrave in his effort to win a gold medal in each of five Olympics. He would be the third athlete, not the first, to accomplish that.  The Hungarian fencer Aladar Gerevich won gold medals in six Olympics, and his teammate Pal Kovacs won gold in five.</p>
