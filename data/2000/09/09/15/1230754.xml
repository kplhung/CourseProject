        <p>''Make it real'' could be the rallying cry for much contemporary painting, Charles Spurrier's included. For nearly a decade Mr. Spurrier has literalized painting by using chewed gum, Vaseline and most consistently an idiosyncratic technique in which he begins with surfaces made of clear tape colored with his fingerprints in paint and then adds colored papers, foils, images and even plastic beads.</p>

        <p>Through Oct. 14</p>
        <p>''Make it real'' could be the rallying cry for much contemporary painting, Charles Spurrier's included. For nearly a decade Mr. Spurrier has literalized painting by using chewed gum, Vaseline and most consistently an idiosyncratic technique in which he begins with surfaces made of clear tape colored with his fingerprints in paint and then adds colored papers, foils, images and even plastic beads.</p>
        <p>With this exhibition, Mr. Spurrier seems to pull out all the stops, as if to prove that his method's possibilities are as limitless as those of more traditional methods. But in some ways he seems to cut the ground out from under himself. For one thing, making it real often comes down to making it slick and at times so superbly finished that the surface seems machine-made.</p>
        <p>A case in point is ''The Motivator,'' whose patterned surface, topped off with bright blue lights and hanging strands of blue plastic beads, resembles real gift wrapping paper. There are also too many simple equations: the pine-tree-shaped car fresheners that hang from and determine the motifs of ''Imitation of Prayer''; the dense collages of jeweled brooches  seen through a veil of bright jewel-like beads in ''Everything.''</p>
        <p>The simpler, less cloying, more clearly hand-worked pieces succeed best, like the glowing mandala-like orb of red fingerprints, stopped short by an expanse of wood grain, in ''Invitation of Now''; the variously floral schemes of ''Second Nature''; and the tightly syncopated grid, with its wood grained squares and colored circles, of ''Course for Gratitude.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spurrier can do anything he wants with his preferred means; he may need to be choosier.</p>
