        <p>During his first news conference since Bridgestone/Firestone announced the recall of 6.5 million tires used mainly on Ford Explorers, William C. Ford Jr., Ford Motor's chairman, today defended his decision to let the company's president, Jacques Nasser,  handle all public appearances concerning the tire problems. The company also announced that it would buy back $5 billion of its stock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford said it was Mr. Nasser's responsibility as the head of Ford's management team to respond to the initial recall, and once the recall became a much larger public relations and regulatory issue it would have been confusing to change.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford is the great-grandson of Henry Ford and his mother is a granddaughter of Harvey S. Firestone Sr., the tire maker's founder and a friend of Henry Ford. But Mr. Ford said today that his family relationships had not prompted him to recuse himself from the tire issue.</p>
        <p>Indeed, he was sharply critical of Firestone, which was purchased by the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan in 1988, saying that, ''It hurts to see a family name and a family heritage tarnished so badly.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford defended the Ford board's decision to distribute cash to shareholders in the middle of a crisis by buying back stock.</p>
        <p>He said the move would not interfere with Ford's handling of the tire issue and represented a reward to shareholders for holding their stock.</p>
        <p>''We believe this is very much a tire issue, not a Ford issue,'' he said at the news conference, which was held this afternoon after Ford's board had met to review the tire problems.</p>
        <p>The moves by Ford came as Congressional investigators are focusing on whether Ford and Firestone chose too low a pressure for the inflation of the tires -- 26 pounds per square inch -- and whether the tires were adequately tested at that pressure before being put on Explorers.</p>
        <p>Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is the chairman of the House Commerce Subcommittee for Consumer Protection, scheduled a hearing next Thursday morning on the companies' choice and testing of the tire pressure. Mr. Tauzin has demanded that both companies provide all of their test data to his subcommittee and the House Commerce Subcommittee for Oversight and Investigation by Friday evening.</p>
        <p>The inquiry comes as personal injury lawyers are showing renewed interest in failures of tires made by other manufacturers, which, like Firestone until this week, have dismissed problems as resulting from customers' neglect of the tires.</p>
        <p>C. Tab Turner, a lawyer in Little Rock, Ark., who specializes in tire failure and vehicle rollover cases and who has filed some of the many lawsuits against Ford and Firestone, said that he had seen during litigation many of the Firestone test results that Mr. Tauzin is now demanding.</p>
        <p>The recalled tire models suffered tread separations -- the type of tire problem now blamed in dozens of fatal crashes -- in 600 to 700 of the roughly 1,000 tests that Firestone conducted over the last decade, he said. Many of the tests were designed to push the tires to their limit to determine when tread separation occurred, but the sheer number of tests shows that Firestone suspected a problem, he contended.</p>
        <p>Firestone officials did not return calls for comment today but have said repeatedly that the tire maker's safety staff only became aware of a problem at the beginning of August, just before the recall was announced on Aug. 9. But the company's financial records show that the company's accountants had identified a problem at least by 1998.</p>
        <p>Michael Vaughn, a Ford spokesman, said that the company had tested the tires at 26 pounds per square inch by driving Explorers with the tires at 100 miles per hour for a distance of 200 miles on a test track in Arizona in 1989. No problems were detected, he said.</p>
        <p>Ford proceeded with the buyback today despite concerns raised even by some Wall Street analysts that returning money to shareholders now might be viewed as insensitive given the nearly 100 deaths linked to the failure of Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>Henry D. G. Wallace, Ford's chief financial officer, said that the stock buyback represented a continuation of the company's plan, announced last April, to distribute to shareholders $10 billion of the automaker's  cash reserves. The company set up a plan in April to give stockholders a choice of cash or additional shares, but so many chose the shares that the company ended up distributing only $5.3 billion of the planned $10 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tauzin declined to comment on the buyback. Joan Claybrook, the president of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said that she was not concerned as long as the buyback did not affect the recall.</p>
        <p>Financial analysts applauded Ford's move even while noting the awkward timing. ''You can be a little surprised they did it in the face of the tire fiasco,'' said Ron Tadross, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.  ''The tire issue is a completely separate issue and this doesn't restrict at all Ford's ability to deal with the recall.''</p>
        <p>Ford shares rose 69 cents, to $25.94.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallace said that Ford had $20 billion in cash now, so disbursing $5 billion would have no effect on the company's financial soundness or ability to handle the recall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford, who took control of the company back from professional managers when he became chairman at the beginning of last year, also said that the tire issue would not prevent him from trying to position Ford as the auto industry's leader in safety and environmental issues.</p>
        <p>''It's not a flavor of the month, it's a flavor of a lifetime, it's a flavor of a career,'' he said.</p>
