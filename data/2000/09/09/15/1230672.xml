        <p>What  Gov. George W. Bush did today was an extraordinary turnabout. After weeks of objections to the debate schedule that the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates had been proposing, he suddenly agreed to all of it: three encounters with Vice President Al Gore, on the dates that the commission proposed, in the locations that the commission specified.</p>
        <p>He even agreed to Boston, which his advisers had dismissed as a Democratic stronghold that stacked the deck against their candidate.</p>
        <p>But by the time Mr. Bush's representatives sat down with the debate commission's officials today, they really had no other choice. They had to cut their losses and stop the regular pounding that Mr. Bush had been taking in the news media for what looked like a nervousness about formal debates.</p>
        <p>And they had to move on, because a continuing debate over debates threatened to be yet another distraction for a campaign bedeviled by too many of them. They knew that for Mr. Bush to communicate his chosen message to voters, he had to put an end to the extraneous story lines.</p>
        <p>''The campaign recognizes that it has to get back on offense, back on its own agenda, and out of the muck,'' said one prominent Republican strategist.</p>
        <p>Today's agreement spoke volumes about the change in the Bush campaign's fortunes over the last several weeks. Before, Mr. Bush enjoyed a considerable advantage over Mr. Gore in the polls, and for a front-runner, debates always represent more of a risk than an opportunity.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush now seems to be trailing by a few percentage points, and for an underdog, debates hold the promise of mixing up the dynamic, changing the momentum.</p>
        <p>''Bush needs debates,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, ''because with debates, you can shake up the political environment.''</p>
        <p>Debates also represent one of the rare times when a candidate can speak directly to an enormous number of voters, without having to rely on the conduit of journalists, and for Mr. Bush, that is more attractive than ever before.</p>
        <p>The last several weeks have demonstrated to him and his advisers just how unpredictable the 24-hour news cycle is and how quickly reporters can latch onto a mistake or a surprise that has nothing to do with what a candidate is peddling, and yank him off course.</p>
        <p>That has happened to Mr. Bush again and again, and those mishaps coupled with the realignment of the candidates in the polls, changed the narratives associated with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore. All at once, it was Mr. Bush who could not gain his footing, and Mr. Gore who loped with an unbroken stride.</p>
        <p>For the 90 minutes of a debate, however, there is no commentary, no interpretation: just the candidates saying what they choose and, if they don't stumble, what they want the voters to hear.</p>
        <p>''This is Bush's chance to get his message out unfiltered, uncensored, unedited,'' Mr. Luntz said. ''And that's exactly what he wants. And that's exactly what will get his campaign back on track.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush had wanted debates that were less formal, and shorter. His aides had proposed having only one 90-minute commission debate, and two 60-minute ones on television news programs. The news program debates would not have been carried by all the major networks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's communications director, Karen P. Hughes, insisted today that he might still get his wish for a more spontaneous exchange between the candidates. As the candidate played hard to get, she said, the debate commission grew agreeable to talking about creative, spontaneous formats for the debates.</p>
        <p>But the Bush campaign has not received any firm agreement along those lines.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Bush and his advisers appear to be taking something of a gamble, worth it to them now because the holdout had not worked to their advantage, any further holdout may bring only them more grief, and they need to move their focus to putting Mr. Gore on the defensive.</p>
        <p>''The last couple of weeks have not been pleasant, and I think there was a desire not to allow this cloud to linger any longer,'' said Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>A Bush campaign adviser said that while events had clearly been moving toward an agreement on debates, today's deal may well have been sealed by the emergence of newly critical appraisals of Mr. Gore's fund-raising efforts.</p>
        <p>At last, the Republican official said, Mr. Gore was on the hot seat. And Mr. Bush's advisers knew that if they did not reach an agreement on debates today, they might help Mr. Gore out of that uncomfortable spot by keeping Mr. Bush in one.</p>
        <p>''This decision was locked in by the fact that Bush finally got some traction, after weeks of no traction,'' the official said. ''They don't want to take that away.''</p>
        <p>And with less than two months to go before Election Day, they may not be able to afford to.</p>
