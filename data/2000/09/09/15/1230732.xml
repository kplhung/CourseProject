        <p>The Republican National Committee began broadcasting a new commercial, ''Let's See/ Education,'' in Michigan and Pennsylvania on Monday. The spot, produced by Alex Castellanos's firm, takes aim at the investigation into fund-raising by the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 and then offers a critical assessment of Vice President Al Gore's education proposals.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Cold Harbor Films</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The 30-second commercial, like other Republican spots, uses a small television screen on a kitchen counter to show flickering images of Mr. Gore. The vice president is seen speaking to a crowd, answering questions behind the lectern in the White House briefing room (it appears to be his ''no controlling legal authority'' news conference) and addressing the Democratic National Convention last month. Text superimposed over the images cites the number of people indicted and convicted and who took the Fifth Amendment or fled the country in the fund-raising investigation. On education, the text reads ''No real testing'' and ''No Testing No Accountability.'' The final text refers viewers to the Republican National Committee Web site gorewillsayanything.com.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- A female announcer: ''Al Gore is promising campaign finance reform. Can I believe him? Because of Gore's last fund-raising campaign, 22 people have been indicted, 12 convicted, 70 took the Fifth Amendment and 18 witnesses fled the country.</p>
        <p>''Now Al Gore is promising more accountability in our schools. And that sounds good. Until you find out he doesn't require any real testing. And no testing means no accountability.</p>
        <p>''Just more politics, from Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The numbers of people cited in the campaign finance investigation were taken from a television news broadcast and are probably too low, Congressional officials say.</p>
        <p>On education, the advertisement is accurate in stating that Mr. Gore would not require mandatory nationwide standardized testing for students. But Mr. Gore does propose voluntary national tests for fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math, and he encourages states to participate in the National Assessment of Educational Progress, an exam administered nationally to a sample of students. Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, would require states to participate in the national test and would demand that they impose mandatory reading and math tests in third through eighth grades.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The spot tries to use the 1996 campaign finance scandal to undercut Mr. Gore's credibility on a wholly unrelated issue, education reform. The mixed message leaves little time for a meaningful contrast of the two candidates' positions on school testing, an important policy difference that Mr. Bush hopes will attract female voters.</p>
