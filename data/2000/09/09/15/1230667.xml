      <abstract>
        <p>Op-Ed article by Gish Jen says case of Dr Wen Ho Lee dramatizes what many Americans believe to be true: for members of minority groups, there is equal opportunity, but not justice or equality before the law; says she does not know if Lee was singled out because of his race, but experience of many Asian-Americans, herself included, is such that it would be no surprise if that were the case; says association of Lee, a Taiwan-born American citizen, with mainland espionage efforts is not reasonable; notes dramatic drop in applications of Asian-American scientists to work in American weapons labs as result of Lee case; calls for thorough investigation of Lee prosecution, and end to racial profiling (M)</p>

        <p>Is this America? To think of Wen Ho Lee in his nine months of solitary confinement is to think not of Horatio Alger, but of Kafka. Has the American dream turned into the American nightmare? We are treated today to the pictures of Wen Ho Lee free to go fishing but are haunted by our private visions of him shackled and alone.</p>
        <p>Whether or not it can be proved he was a victim of racial profiling, Mr. Lee's case dramatizes what many Americans believe to be true: There is opportunity here, but justice? Equality before the law? No, not for the model minority, it appears.</p>
        <p>We cannot know if Wen Ho Lee was singled out because of his race. But the experience of many Asian-Americans, myself included, is such that we would be more surprised to discover that he had not than to learn that he had. We know too well the associative nature of the mainstream imagination, which manages to link Asian-Americans of any type to whatever Asian phenomenon might be momentarily tweaking its poor gray noodle.</p>
        <p>This is sometimes funny. I once shared a stage with a former senator who was so moved by his own account of the bravery of Japanese-American soldiers in World War II that he turned from his lectern and looked, dramatically, repeatedly, straight at me every time he said ''Japanese.'' And what a moment for history it would have been if only I had been Japanese or Japanese-American.</p>
        <p>Other examples are not funny: In 1982, Vincent Chin, a Chinese-American, was murdered in Detroit by unemployed autoworkers incensed by Japanese competition. Wen Ho Lee was assumed sympathetic to the People's Republic of China even though he was born and brought up in Taiwan, an island not known for its adoration of Beijing.</p>
        <p>China is the new bogeyman. That's bad news for us Chinese-Americans, but it is also bad news for Korean-Americans, Vietnamese-Americans and Japanese-Americans. How is it, though, that we all rise and fall with the tide of countries we may never have seen? We are sick of being seen as not quite American, of being viewed, generation after generation, as guests to be welcomed -- or not.</p>
        <p>The association of a Taiwan-born American citizen with mainland espionage efforts might seem to be what the legal scholar Jody Armour would call ''reasonable racism'' -- but it is not reasonable, and causes real hardship.</p>
        <p>Since the Wen Ho Lee case began, the number of Asian and Asian-American scientists applying to work in our nation's weapons labs has declined dramatically. Many would-be applicants have expressed fears of harassment and discrimination. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is now investigating the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in response to claims of discrimination by nine employees; the agency is also investigating Los Alamos.</p>
        <p>Everyone can see this is unfortunate for United States defense research. But less appreciated is the bitterness in the hearts of the scientists involved, or of the many others seeking work elsewhere. These were, by and large, people who believed in America -- people who hoped to believe in it, and who deserved to believe in it.</p>
        <p>Today Wen Ho Lee is free, and Asian-American advocacy groups are flexing new muscle. In apologizing to Mr. Lee, Judge James Parker  displayed a courageous, refreshing, most American candor that would be unthinkable in other parts of the world. The system ultimately worked.</p>
        <p>Still this case gives us reason to raise the hue and cry. A thorough investigation is certainly in order. Maybe the question is: Who could most objectively mount such an investigation? As a friend suggested to me, perhaps in cases like this the Justice Department should set up a citizen review board similar to those that oversee police departments in  some cities. This would be a good first step toward restoring public confidence in our judicial system.</p>
        <p>But how to restore faith in the American dream? That will take investigations of a wider, deeper sort.</p>
