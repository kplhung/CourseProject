        <p>''OBVIOUSLY, I didn't mislead anyone,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said in Wednesday's debate, referring to her past denials of any liaison between her husband and Monica S. Lewinsky. If Mrs. Clinton's latest conclusion doesn't seem so obvious to you, that's because Clintonian language can be idiosyncratic. It depends on what the meaning of ''mislead'' is.</p>
        <p>In politics, the word has traditionally been used for acts of deception that may not be explicitly false, like the recent television commercial that juxtaposes images of Rick A. Lazio and Daniel Patrick Moynihan walking down different corridors. The images are not false -- both men have indeed walked down corridors alone -- but the juxtaposition gives a misleading impression that they are allies striding together.</p>
        <p>In President Clinton's speech apologizing for his misconduct with Ms. Lewinsky, after explaining that his previous statements ''were legally accurate'' but ''gave a false impression,'' he concluded by saying, ''I misled people, including even my wife.'' He was using the standard definition: to lead into error, to cause someone to form an incorrect belief.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton prefers a new lexicographic approach. When asked if she regretted misleading the public by asserting in 1998 that her husband had not been unfaithful or untruthful, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged she had given Americans a false impression. But to her, that was not the same as misleading them because she wasn't being intentionally false.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, I didn't mislead anyone. I didn't know the truth,'' Mrs. Clinton said. Obviously, she was not satisfied with conventional reference works like the American Heritage Dictionary. In differentiating ''misleading'' from ''deceptive'' and ''delusive,'' it notes: ''Misleading is the most nonspecific of these terms; it makes no clear implication regarding intent.''</p>
        <p>Is this semantic quibbling? Maybe it's petty to focus on one word during an hour debate. But it was one of the few words spoken by her -- or Mr. Lazio -- that did not seem scripted. Why, instead of misinterpreting the question, didn't Mrs. Clinton directly deal with an issue that has dogged her since the Gennifer Flowers scandal in 1992?</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton helped her husband become president by appearing with him on ''60 Minutes'' and impressing the many voters willing to let their marital problems remain private. But instead of simply refusing to answer personal questions, the Clintons also called Ms. Flowers a liar. In retrospect, those protestations strike many people as misleading -- and unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Americans don't expect their politicians to be perfect, especially when marital issues are involved, so why bother dissembling? Instead of her rambling answer Wednesday night, Mrs. Clinton could have dispatched the issue with a few simple sentences.</p>
        <p>''Look,'' she might have said, ''my husband lied to me, and I believed him. You could call me either naive or loyal. Our marriage is our business. But I shouldn't have publicly claimed to know the truth. I'm sorry I misled the American people and blamed it on an enemy conspiracy.''</p>
        <p>INSTEAD, she parsed words and blamed her husband and talked about her pain and philosophized about the nature of time. ''I wish that we all could look at it from the perspective of history, but we can't yet,'' she explained, adding helpfully, ''We're going to have to wait until those books are written.'' Then she segued into Newt Gingrich, reverting to the robotic sound bites she used to deflect questions most of the evening.</p>
        <p>Considering how much time and money Mrs. Clinton had to prepare, you might have expected her to be more adept, but then you could say the same thing about Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>During the debate, Mr. Lazio was slightly more inclined to answer questions directly, but he looked like a high-school debater overdosing on coffee. His canned material was painfully stagy. His offer to ban soft money, transparently implausible to begin with, just got more embarrassing as he walked over to hector Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Here were two Senate candidates who had set records for raising money, and they knew what they needed: gravitas for him, sincerity for her. But they could not buy those images, at least not in Wednesday's debate. It was the Energizer Bunny versus R2-D2. Aside from depressing voters, the performance raised a question about campaign finance reform: should the contributors to these two campaigns be entitled to their money back?</p>
