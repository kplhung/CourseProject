        <p>Police officers investigating a burglary complaint at a home here discovered more than 160 guns, a variety of explosives and fuses, rocket engines, and at least 150 pounds of gunpowder, the Westchester County district attorney, Jeanine F. Pirro, said today.</p>
        <p>James G. Neff, 38, who lives at 85 Myrtle Avenue with his parents, was arrested today and charged with criminal weapons possession and intent to sell.</p>
        <p>Both charges are felonies punishable by up to seven years in prison, and further charges are expected, Mrs. Pirro said.</p>
        <p>The police discovered a book on how to build an atomic bomb, along with books on building conventional bombs, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>''This was apparently a munitions factory,'' Mrs. Pirro said. ''The defendant, a machinist by trade, was making his own weapons.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Neff pleaded not guilty at an arraignment in Village Court.</p>
        <p>The weapons, which were found throughout the house, included grenades hollowed out to hold explosives, pipes of various sizes that had been welded and drilled for use as bombs, fuses, timing devices, magnets, commercial-grade chemicals, gunpowder and thousands of rounds of ammunition, including armor-piercing bullets.</p>
        <p>Chief George Longworth of the Dobbs Ferry Police Department said the Westchester County bomb squad was testing the explosives in Hawthorne.</p>
        <p>The guns included more than 130 rifles and shotguns and over 30 handguns. The police said they also found  seven silencers. Mrs. Pirro said the guns appeared to be unlicensed.</p>
        <p>''I don't remember a cache as large as this,'' Mrs. Pirro said. ''What is unusual is not just the guns but the fact that he was making guns, silencers, pipe bombs, and hand grenades. There were chemical explosives that you need only add sugar to that would have blown up an area.''</p>
        <p>The weapons were discovered Tuesday when the police responded to repeated calls from a relative of Mr. Neff's about a burglary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neff has worked for two years at Reveo Inc., a research and development company in Elmsford that has developed electric cars, among other products.</p>
        <p>''He has been a model employee,'' said the company's chairman, Sadeg Faris. ''He was a nice guy; he worked 14-hour days. He had been given awards for doing a great job, and everybody liked him.''</p>
