        <p>Shares in one of Europe's biggest computer service groups, Cap Gemini of France, rose sharply after the company announced strong sales and profit growth in the first half and said results were helped by a tax credit related to its $11.1 billion acquisition earlier this year of the consulting practice of Ernst &amp; Young. Cap Gemini's chief financial officer, Frederic Lemoine, said Cap Gemini would benefit from the deductibility over 15 years of as much as 1.6 billion euros ($1.3 billion) from United States taxes as a result of good-will amortization related to the Ernst &amp; Young acquisition.</p>
