        <p>The Russian government suspended a decision to seize frequencies of the country's two biggest mobile phone providers in a move investors said showed the government had not lost sight of protecting property rights.

Though the government did not explain why it had recalled the frequencies, analysts said Moscow's third mobile phone provider, Sonic Duo, which is owned partly by a government-controlled company, would have been the most likely recipient.</p>
