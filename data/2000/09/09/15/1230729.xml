        <p>In a stark concession to the seriousness of New York State's shortage of qualified teachers, the Board of Regents said today that it would ask the Legislature to approve a measure allowing retired teachers to return to the classroom and draw a full salary while continuing to receive their pension benefits.</p>
        <p>Teachers who accept the offer must agree to teach in a low-performing school or in a subject area, like math or science, where schools are having a difficult time attracting qualified teachers. The program is aimed at attracting teachers to the 173 districts and up to 1,000 schools that the state classifies as low-performing or high-need, and includes the roughly 100 schools that are in danger of being closed for their poor performance.</p>

        <p>In a stark concession to the seriousness of New York State's shortage of qualified teachers, the Board of Regents said today that it would ask the Legislature to approve a measure allowing retired teachers to return to the classroom and draw a full salary while continuing to receive their pension benefits.</p>
        <p>Teachers who accept the offer must agree to teach in a low-performing school or in a subject area, like math or science, where schools are having a difficult time attracting qualified teachers. The program is aimed at attracting teachers to the 173 districts and up to 1,000 schools that the state classifies as low-performing or high-need, and includes the roughly 100 schools that are in danger of being closed for their poor performance.</p>
        <p>The increased costs of hiring the more experienced teachers would be borne by the school districts, although the state has been allocating more funds in recent years for special recruitment programs.</p>
        <p>The proposal is likely to enjoy bipartisan support among legislators and the governor's office, government officials said today. The Republicans in the Senate introduced a similar measure last spring, but it was ultimately dropped from an education package signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki in May.</p>
        <p>Joe Conway, a spokesman for Governor Pataki, said in response to today's developments that the governor ''is very pleased that the Regents share the governor's belief that teacher recruitment is a major issue. We welcome their support in the ongoing effort to attract and recruit qualified teachers.''</p>
        <p>About 20 percent of the state's 230,000 teachers will need to be replaced in the next few years, according to the Regents. And there is an immediate need for at least 16,000 certified teachers.</p>
        <p>Many details of the proposal remain to be worked out, but such a program would substantially increase some retired teachers' incomes.</p>
        <p>Depending on how the legislation is written, a returning teacher could earn anywhere from the money he or she was earning upon retirement to some lower level on a teacher's pay scale.</p>
        <p>Under the most generous scenario, a teacher who retired at the age of 55 after 25 years of service from a job paying $70,000 would, by returning to the classroom, continue to earn that amount plus $35,000 a year in pension benefits, bringing his annual income to more than $100,000.</p>
        <p>Under current law that limits a retiree's earnings, that teacher could only earn $17,000 beyond his pension if he went back to work in New York State. The Regents will also ask the Legislature for up to $39 million to support mentoring programs of beginning teachers by older, more experienced ones and for $5 million more in grants to colleges to increase programs that train teachers in math, science and other key subjects.</p>
        <p>The Regents' proposal comes after several school districts across the state, including New York City, struggled to fill teaching positions in the weeks leading up to the start of school.</p>
        <p>Moreover, state officials say that more than half of current teachers will be eligible to retire in this decade. The situation in New York City may be even worse, with the teachers' union maintaining the city will need to fill 54,000 jobs in the next five years.</p>
        <p>The problems of teacher recruitment have forced school districts around the country to try new incentives to attract and retain qualified teachers, including offering low-interest loans for housing and offering signing bonuses to teachers who move from other careers. Last year, the Texas Legislature approved a similar pension measure to the one proposed by the Regents to entice experienced teachers out of retirement.</p>
        <p>In May, Governor Pataki signed into law a program, called ''Teachers for Tomorrow,'' that included extra pay for teachers who agreed to work in areas of shortages and tuition grants for teachers to complete licensing requirements. However, in New York under current law, retirees lose $1 of their pension benefits for every $1 they earn beyond $17,000 a year teaching.</p>
        <p>Harold O. Levy, the chancellor of the New York City school system, where current and predicted teacher shortages are the worst, said he welcomed the Regents proposal. But, he warned, ''it doesn't help in adequate numbers to solve the problem, and it is expensive.''</p>
        <p>Just how expensive the program will be is not clear. Among the uncertainties are whether principals and superintendents would be free to choose which retired teachers they wanted to hire and and whether retirees would receive priority over younger uncertified teachers who want the jobs. By 2003, all newly hired teachers in the state will have to be certified.</p>
        <p>Also unknown is whether retired teachers would have to be hired in order of seniority.</p>
        <p>''Every teacher who is retired might not be appropriate to come back,'' said Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Education committee and who said he supports the Regents' proposal.</p>
        <p>In the program outlined by the Regents, teachers would have to be retired for at least one year before enrolling, and they could participate for up to five years. Richard P. Mills, the education commissioner, said he believed the cost of the program to school districts would be minimal because the retired teachers would be hired for positions that otherwise could not be filled.</p>
        <p>Carl T. Hayden, chancellor of the Board of Regents, said that New York State trains about 10,000 more teachers each year than it hires, with many of the state's education graduates opting for other professions or choosing to teach in other states. In addition, large numbers of New York City teachers, including many of the best prepared, leave teaching within a few years after starting.</p>
        <p>Despite the lack of details, the proposal was lauded by officials of teachers' unions and by legislative leaders yesterday. Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the New York City union, commended the Regents for their proposal.</p>
        <p>''The Regents and Commissioner Mills have realized very quickly that in order to get standards higher, the quality of the teachers in the classroom becomes absolutely imperative,'' Ms. Weingarten said.</p>
        <p>The acute nature of the teacher shortage in New York City became starkly apparent this summer when the Board of Education struggled under a court order to hire only certified teachers for its worst-performing schools. Those are the roughly 1 in 10 that are designated by the Education Department as being under registration review.</p>
        <p>In addition to finding new teachers, New York City has a major problem holding onto its young hires. James Wyckoff, a professor at the State University of New York's Albany campus, presented data to a Regents meeting on Wednesday indicating that 2 of every 5 teachers hired by the city in 1991 had quit the profession within six years.</p>
