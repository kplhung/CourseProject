        <p>It has the political heft of a Disney cartoon, the dramatic tension of ''Saturday Night Live'' and is so upbeat it should have been called ''Everybody Loves Elian.'' Still, the Fox Family Channel movie ''The Elian Gonzalez Story'' is significant merely because it exists. The little boy had hardly set foot on Florida's shore before the course of his life became inseparable from the television circus around him. This simple-minded film, the latest turn in the media extravaganza, displays how television shapes and reshapes events.</p>
        <p>Though it seems the story has been around much longer, it was only last Thanksgiving when Elian was found floating in an inner tube, having survived a flight from Cuba in a crowded boat that claimed his mother's life. Almost at once, television news helped make the battle over Elian's custody an international incident.</p>
        <p>When his relatives in Miami refused to return him to his father in Cuba, their campaign was fought with photo ops and sound bites as much as with the law. Television viewers became  accustomed to seeing crowds of Cuban-Americans gathered outside the house in Little Havana, Elian's cousin Marisleysis's emotional and sometimes hysterical on-camera appearances and a happy-looking Elian paraded before the cameras. Elian's life became a virtual gallery of iconic moments, culminating with the still photograph of a federal agent in riot gear taking the boy at gunpoint.</p>
        <p>But if the cable news channels puffed the story up, this movie re-enacts those scenes as bland caricatures. Trying to change a complex political battle into entertainment for the largest possible audience, the film creates a fantasy in which there are only heroes.</p>
        <p>Elian's father, Juan Miguel (Esai Morales, in a cardboard role), loves his son and believes in Castro's Cuba. Most of the film, though, assumes the point of view of the Miami relatives. If they are guilty of anything, it is loving the little boy too much, as television-movie characters so often do. Their fictional images here stray far from the news clips that created such divided opinions about them.</p>
        <p>Elian's Great-Uncle Lazaro, in reality an angry presence with a striking pompadour of black hair, is played by Miguel Sandoval as a warm, balding teddy bear. The fictional Marisleysis (Laura Elena Harring) is more rational than the actual one and is given demure brown hair, a small but telling detail. Replacing her artificial brassy color has the instant effect of raising her social class without saying a word. And any hard-nosed calculations from either the Cuban-American community in Miami or American politicians -- calculations that so coldly exploited the child in reality -- have been smoothed away.</p>
        <p>There's no reason to think any other network would have done things much differently. As early as last spring, CBS had a deal in place to create its own Elian movie, a project the network is still developing with Craig Anderson, the producer of its romanticized mini-series ''Sally Hemings.'' First as news and now as fiction, the Elian story reveals television's knee-jerk tendencies.</p>
        <p>But the relatively new Fox Family Channel (one of Fox's cable channels, not to be confused with the broadcast network, of ''The Simpsons'' and ''X-Files'' fame) apparently wants to out-Disney Disney, so this film goes as far as possible in stripping the Elian tale of any hint of controversy. Fox's own press material spells out what the film intends to do: ''Behind the headlines. Beyond the politics. The story of a family torn apart.'' After you recover from the sugar-shock of those cloying lines, you can see that they unwittingly point to what is bogus about the movie. It can't get behind the headlines if it refuses to deal with complex motives. And the idea of going beyond politics is absurd because politics is what made the story a public rather than a private matter in the first place.</p>
        <p>Instead, the film's approach brings to mind the singsong way Conan O'Brien used to call the boy ''Leetle Ay-lian,'' mocking the sappy news reports. This movie even begins with a cliched vision of sunny Cuba, with Che posters plastered on buildings, colorful laundry hanging across alleys, Elian kicking a soccer ball with friends. Juan Miguel calls Elian home. It is time for him to return to his mother, who tells her ex-husband that she is taking their son to Havana for a few days.</p>
        <p>In an odd dramatic turn, the disaster at sea is saved for later, in a few flashbacks. We cut to the Gonzalez family in Miami watching the Thanksgiving parade on television and being called to get their young relative. Soon Lazaro, in a phone conversation with his nephew Juan Miguel, blurts out, ''For his own good, I think Elian should stay here.'' He tells his family about the decision: ''I didn't plan it. I hadn't even thought about it.'' It's hard to complain that we don't share Lazaro's thoughts when the script has so clearly decided not to give him any.</p>
        <p>The central scene comes when Lazaro tells why he is determined to keep the boy. In one of a handful of skittish references the script chooses not to explore, Lazaro tells his advisers that while they may want to use Elian for political reasons, he has different reasons. His eyes welling with tears, he says: ''I want to keep him here 'cause I would miss him so damn much if he left. It would break my heart if he left.'' We're meant to sympathize, but such lines inadvertently depict Lazaro as a selfish airhead.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Marisleysis believes Elian is a miracle child delivered to them by God, making ''The Elian Gonzalez Story'' sound like ''Touched by an Angel.'' No wonder the film dashes through a tough scene it cannot ignore. Marisleysis assumes a tone of sad necessity when she creates a home video of Elian telling his father he wants to stay in Miami. In this brief re-creation, Elian (Alec Roberts) is not nearly as angry as he was in that real tape, which was so unsettling it quickly became known as ''the hostage video.''</p>
        <p>There are a few other times when the film takes a similar hit-and-run approach to deeper issues. Everything about the family's relations with their Cuban-American political advisers, the real untold story, is even murkier in the film. Armando Guttierrez (Tony Amendola), the Gonzalez family's spokesman, appears out of nowhere offering help with legal affairs and public relations. He is seen in the office of a group called Democracy Movement, in reality a Cuban-American organization behind many of the vigils in Little Havana, though that is not explained either.</p>
        <p>The film is most laughable when it resorts to caricatures of Janet Reno, Fidel Castro and Donato Dalrymple, the fisherman who said he pulled Elian from the sea but is shown here watching from the boat, then claiming credit for heroism. When James Quattochi imitates Dalrymple's hoarse, hysterical voice on the morning the federal agents take Elian, the film plunges into pure, unintentional comedy.</p>
        <p>Even that most iconic moment, when the agents arrive, is softened here with Cuban music playing in the background. The scene quickly shifts to Elian happily reunited with his father.</p>
        <p>It has taken less than three months for the television seesaw to transform a complex political event into this pablum, which is all too typical of how television recycles its own excesses. As recent news films of Elian going to his first day of school in Cuba showed, the story is still here. All we can hope is that we are spared a sequel, ''Little Elian Goes to Therapy.''</p>
