        <p>Gun violence costs Americans $100 billion a year, according to a new book by two economists that is the first effort to make a comprehensive estimate of the price the nation pays for criminal shootings, gun accidents and suicides committed with guns.</p>
        <p>In arriving at that figure, the authors, Philip J. Cook of Duke University and Jens Ludwig of Georgetown University, departed from earlier approaches that looked only at costs like the medical expense of treating gunshot wounds and the lost productivity of gunshot victims. Those are only a small part of the real total, the authors say.</p>
        <p>The much larger price, they say, involves ''the devastating emotional costs experienced by relatives and friends of gunshot victims, and the fear and general reduction in quality of life that the threat of gun violence imposes on everyone in America, including people who are not victimized.'' These include all manner of costs, from the time lost waiting in line at airports to pass through metal detectors, to the difference between actual property values in violent neighborhoods and what those values would be if there was no gun violence.</p>
        <p>In their book, ''Gun Violence: The Real Costs,'' to be published next month by Oxford University Press, Professors Cook and Ludwig applied a method widely accepted by economists as a way of determining hard-to-measure intangible costs. This method, known as contingent valuation, asks people how much they would pay to avoid a problem.</p>
        <p>In a nationally representative telephone survey, 1,200 people were asked how much they would pay per year to reduce criminal gunshot injuries. The authors applied the results to the nation's entire population to reach a figure of $80 billion.</p>
        <p>As for accidental shootings and gun suicides, the authors drew on previous studies of losses in the workplace and on jury awards to determine the statistical value of life and the costs of nonfatal injuries. That sum came to $20 billion.</p>
        <p>The total, then, for criminal shootings (including murders), accidental shootings and gun suicides is $100 billion, the authors said.</p>
        <p>Their calculation was applauded by a number of economists, criminologists and gun control advocates, who said it showed that the cost was  much larger than previously realized and therefore should be given greater weight in debates over public policy.</p>
        <p>''One might quibble with the figure, since the question of how much people would pay to avoid gun violence is hard to know,'' said Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, ''but it is very helpful to have two skilled economists try to figure out how large the cost of gun violence really is.''</p>
        <p>Tom Diaz, a senior policy analyst with the anti-handgun Violence Policy Center in Washington, said, ''The gun industry offloads tremendous costs onto people who don't use its products, like a polluter dumping on a city, so it's good to force people to realize what these costs are.''</p>
        <p>But the study was criticized by scholars who maintain that guns contribute to public safety, and by gun industry officials, as being too hypothetical and ignoring firearms' benefits.</p>
        <p>Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University, who is well known among gun enthusiasts for his estimate that guns are used 2.5 million times a year in self-defense in the United States, said the new study was ''too hypothetical and too reliant on subjective judgments.''</p>
        <p>''It is also a hopeless task,'' Professor Kleck said. ''You are faced with an unknowable problem: What is human life worth?''</p>
        <p>Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation,  trade association for gun makers, said the authors had failed to count guns' benefits, like their use by the police to stop crime or by civilians in self-defense. The book, Mr. Delfay said, ''is misleading, like looking at the costs of auto accidents without measuring the benefits of cars.''</p>
