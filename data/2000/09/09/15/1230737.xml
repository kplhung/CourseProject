        <p>Reflecting efforts to transform the company from a focus on long distance to broadband services, AT&amp;T begins its first corporate image campaign in about two years today. The budget for the campaign was estimated at $50 million.</p>
        <p>A new theme, ''Boundless,'' replaces the most recent previous theme, ''It's all within your reach.'' In television commercials and print advertisements, the AT&amp;T insignia globe logo is recreated as an oversized, three-dimensional object.</p>
        <p>''We're really trying to change perceptions of the AT&amp;T brand amongst all adults and to revitalize the brand,'' said Dick Martin, executive vice president at AT&amp;T in Basking Ridge, N.J.</p>
        <p>AT&amp; T has been traditionally viewed as ''trustworthy, reliable, prestigious, established,'' he added. ''What we are not seen as being is dynamic, visionary, fast-moving, different, fun.''</p>
        <p>The campaign is being created by the two main AT&amp;T roster agencies, the New York offices of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications, and Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising; the ''It's all within your reach'' campaign had been created by Y.&amp; R. Advertising. AT&amp;T sought ideas from both agencies and decided last month that they should collaborate on the ''Boundless'' campaign. The commercials are by Y.&amp; R and the print ads are by FCB.</p>
