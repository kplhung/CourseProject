        <p>Most bad movies -- and there is no shortage -- are content to amble along the well-trodden path of mediocrity hoping, at best, to remind their audiences of other, better pictures. About such movies there is little to say. But every so often a movie comes along that's bad in such original and unexpected ways that it inspires an almost admiring fascination. You leave the theater in a state of amazement, and say to yourself,  ''Well, I've certainly never seen anything like that before,'' a response that's not unrelated to the thrill you feel after having seen something truly wonderful.</p>
        <p>''Duets,'' Bruce Paltrow's new musical, which features his daughter, Gwyneth, in its impressive ensemble cast, is such a movie. It's not quite ''Ishtar'' or ''Showgirls'' -- it lacks both the perverse integrity and the epic ambition that made those films touchstones of bad movie sublimity -- but it will probably, as those films have, inspire a devoted video cult.

        <p>Most bad movies -- and there is no shortage -- are content to amble along the well-trodden path of mediocrity hoping, at best, to remind their audiences of other, better pictures. About such movies there is little to say. But every so often a movie comes along that's bad in such original and unexpected ways that it inspires an almost admiring fascination. You leave the theater in a state of amazement, and say to yourself,  ''Well, I've certainly never seen anything like that before,'' a response that's not unrelated to the thrill you feel after having seen something truly wonderful.</p>
        <p>''Duets,'' Bruce Paltrow's new musical, which features his daughter, Gwyneth, in its impressive ensemble cast, is such a movie. It's not quite ''Ishtar'' or ''Showgirls'' -- it lacks both the perverse integrity and the epic ambition that made those films touchstones of bad movie sublimity -- but it will probably, as those films have, inspire a devoted video cult. Best to see it now -- I can't imagine you'll have much time -- and reserve yourself a charter membership.</p>
        <p>How can you resist seeing Ms. Paltrow, in a pink outfit that looks as if it was stitched together out of old ladies' bathing caps, singing ''Bette Davis Eyes''? Or Huey Lewis doing Joe Cocker?</p>
        <p>The film explores an odd, out-of-the-way subculture: the world of die-hard, competitive karaoke enthusiasts who, if John Byrum's script is to be believed, travel across the country from bar to bar, belting out the pop hits of yesteryear for prize money and for the thrill, as one character puts it, of being ''a star for three minutes.'' Karaoke is no mere drunken pastime, but rather, we're repeatedly told, ''a way of life.'' For the purposes of this movie, it's a way of life that unites six unhappy people, who make their errant way to Omaha, lured by the promise of glory and a $5,000 purse.</p>
        <p>Their chance pairings -- the duets of the title -- have a carefully arranged unlikeliness. A saintly Cincinnati cabdriver (Scott Speedman) is thrown together with a steely, manic ex-waitress (Maria Bello) who has the voice of an angel and who dispenses sexual favors the way other people use credit cards. Meanwhile, a sleazy karaoke hustler (Mr. Lewis) is reluctantly reunited with his daughter, a third-generation Vegas showgirl (Ms. Paltrow) with the speech patterns of a 12-year-old and the voice of an angel.</p>
        <p>The odd couple whose adventures merit the most screen time consist of a miserable sales executive (Paul Giamatti) on the run from the prison of his empty middle-class life and an ex-convict (Andre Braugher) with the voice of . . . but you get the idea. (All the actors, with the exception of Mr. Braugher, do their own angelic singing. Ms. Bello, it must be said, does a mean Annie Lennox.)</p>
        <p>Last spring, the release of ''Duets'' was held up by a dispute between Mr. Paltrow and Disney about how it should be edited, and the argument seems to have been settled with a blunt ax and a staple gun. Lacking any narrative rhythm, the film flops around like a carp on the kitchen floor, jumping from scene to scene, from musical number to emotional confrontation, before you can figure out what's going on.</p>
        <p>Still, its chaotic sprawl yields some moments of indelible brilliance. ''You have these hidden corners,'' the downward-spiraling salesman cackles to his solemn jailbird friend, and so does the film. It intermittently reveals a dimension of loneliness and vulnerability in the lives of its characters, and suggests that their desperate drift is the symptom of a larger cultural disorder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giamatti's character spends the early part of the movie wandering in a fugue state through a landscape of indistinguishable hotels and airports, and when he falls into karaoke his inchoate sadness turns into a vivid, life-affirming rage. Mr. Giammati, who has won admiration in a series of comic character parts, careers through ''Duets'' like the Tasmanian devil in the Warner Brothers' cartoons.</p>
        <p>At its best -- in Mr. Giamatti's performance and in some of Mr. Lewis's early scenes -- the movie has a tang of gamy alienation that recalls the downbeat, existential black comedies of the early 70's. Unfortunately, the maudlin habits Mr. Paltrow acquired working on dramatic television series like ''The White Shadow'' and ''St. Elsewhere'' wreck the film's tough, satiric possibilities.</p>
        <p>The tearful, conflict-resolving speeches -- in which people say things like, ''You feel sorry for me? Well, I feel sorry for you''; ''you're right, I am the loser,'' and so forth -- arrive punctually, as if timed around commercial breaks. Relationships that had seemed risky and interesting collapse into conventional sentiment. Mr. Braugher, it turns out, has been cast in the role of sacrificial black man, whose job is to assist in the spiritual education of his privileged white companion. All credit to this fine actor for bringing a measure of wit and dignity to this hoariest of liberal-racist Hollywood archetypes.</p>
        <p>After a bizarre climax -- involving a shoot-out and an a cappella version of ''Free Bird'' -- the characters (or do I mean the cast?) wander around looking dazed, as if blinking through the haze of a severe collective hangover and trying to remember just what happened the night before. As I stumbled out of the theater, I had a similar sensation -- not an altogether unpleasant one, I must admit. We could use more bad movies like this.</p>
        <p>''Duets'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes brief nudity, sexual references, gunplay and the brutal murder of two classic Motown songs.</p>
        <p>DUETS  Directed by Bruce Paltrow; written by John Byrum; director of photography, Paul Sarossy; edited by Jerry Greenberg; music by David Newman; production designer, Sharon Seymour; produced by Kevin Jones, Mr. Paltrow and Mr. Byrum; released by Hollywood Pictures. Running time: 113 minutes. This film is rated R.</p>
        <p>WITH: Maria Bello (Suzi Loomis), Andre Braugher (Reggie Kane), Paul Giamatti (Todd Woods), Huey Lewis (Ricky Dean), Gwyneth Paltrow (Liv) and Scott Speedman (Billy).</p>
