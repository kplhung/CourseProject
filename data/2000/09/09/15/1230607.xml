        <p>A teenager trying to concentrate on learning the riff to ''Crosstown Traffic'' hates to be interrupted by Mom shouting into the basement that he needs to clean his room. Imagine how Isaac, Taylor and Zachary Hanson must have felt as they played that Jimi Hendrix chestnut on Monday night at the Hammerstein Ballroom. They were slamming away at guitar, keyboards and drums, trying to grab that groove, and the girls just kept screaming! And they wouldn't stop during Hanson's entire set!</p>
        <p>Hanson, the trio whose 1997 debut, ''Middle of Nowhere'' (Mercury), signaled the advance of teen pop, is the most genuinely adolescent of today's youthful stars. Home-schooled in a large Christian family, writing songs modeled on their parents' favorite 1960's hits, the Hanson brothers lack the hard-edged savvy of Disney trainees like Britney Spears. The siblings' slightly awkward innocence has been packaged; nonetheless, it's real. And that sincerity is becoming harder to encapsulate and sell.</p>

        <p>A teenager trying to concentrate on learning the riff to ''Crosstown Traffic'' hates to be interrupted by Mom shouting into the basement that he needs to clean his room. Imagine how Isaac, Taylor and Zachary Hanson must have felt as they played that Jimi Hendrix chestnut on Monday night at the Hammerstein Ballroom. They were slamming away at guitar, keyboards and drums, trying to grab that groove, and the girls just kept screaming! And they wouldn't stop during Hanson's entire set!</p>
        <p>Hanson, the trio whose 1997 debut, ''Middle of Nowhere'' (Mercury), signaled the advance of teen pop, is the most genuinely adolescent of today's youthful stars. Home-schooled in a large Christian family, writing songs modeled on their parents' favorite 1960's hits, the Hanson brothers lack the hard-edged savvy of Disney trainees like Britney Spears. The siblings' slightly awkward innocence has been packaged; nonetheless, it's real. And that sincerity is becoming harder to encapsulate and sell.</p>
        <p>Hanson is touring in support of its second full release, ''This Time Around,'' which has not had the commercial impact that the group's current label, Island/Def Jam, expected. Its songs still ride on ebullient choruses, but the caffeine-high beats and shiny production have been tempered to make room for band interplay and slightly more pensive songwriting.</p>
        <p>The title track, featured at Monday's concert, seems to be about Cassie Bernall, the Columbine High School murder victim whom some have fashioned into a martyr. Another song confronts the death of a young soldier or crime victim. ''I'm dying to be alive,'' Taylor Hanson shouted soulfully, leading the crowd in one of the stranger teeny-bopper chants of the year.</p>
        <p>These green attempts at existentialism were surrounded by love songs that also captured real teenage angst. ''I'm definitely sure I'm not sure about it,'' the brothers harmonized, sounding more like the boys fans would meet in school than dream lovers.</p>
        <p>Hanson's new musical direction also shows signs of teenage equivocation. Some moments on Monday did edge toward hippie jamming, especially when the youthful blues guitarist Jonny Lang sat in. But Hanson worked through a lexicon of hooks, from 1980's arena rock to Michael Jackson imitation to beer-commercial blues, and brought home-schooling onstage by covering war horses by Janis Joplin, Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones.</p>
        <p>Adolescence is a sweet stumble toward awareness, and Hanson is taking it in front of a fickle audience. Sometimes on Monday night, the boys seemed to wish they really were in the basement their image evokes. That this teen pop group wants any kind of interior artistic life makes it an exception. It's not a marketing plus, but caring about music and about themselves might help Hanson survive.</p>
