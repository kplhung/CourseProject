        <p>LUNDELL-Kert F. Born in Malmo, Sweden, lived in Greenwich Village, NY. Beloved husband of Bretta, devoted father of Erik and Kate, died September 11 of lung cancer. A set designer and artist who had a long and highly acclaimed career. We will miss him for his warmth and humanity. A memorial service will be held on September 27 at 1:00 at St. Luke's Church, 487 Hudson St., NYC. In lieu of flowers, a donation to the National Trust for Historic Preservation would be appreciated.</p>
