        <p>In recent years -- perhaps the turning point was ''Schindler's List'' -- films about the Holocaust have undergone a noticeable change in tone toward a redemptive, even hopeful reckoning with historical catastrophe. The change has been especially evident in documentaries about the period. Claude Lanzmann's ''Shoah'' confronted viewers with the vast, unfathomable horror of genocide, emphasizing the indifference and complicity of European gentiles, a theme further explored in Marcel Ophuls's ''Hotel Terminus'' and ''The Sorrow and the Pity.'' But lately the emphasis has shifted to stories of survival, and testimonials to the courage of those who tried to protect European Jews from the Nazis.</p>
        <p>Having faced the worst evil that human beings are capable of, it has seemed necessary to pay compensatory attention to the persistence of kindness, bravery and resilience in monstrous circumstances.</p>
        <p>''Into the Arms of Strangers,'' a new documentary by Mark Jonathan Harris, tells the story of a group of Jewish children from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia who were fortunate enough to escape, thanks to the Kindertransport, which took 10,000 children to the safety of England in the late 1930's. (The United States government, which could have sponsored a similar program, declined to do so.)</p>
        <p>This film is something of a companion piece to Lisa Gossels's ''Children of Chabannes,'' which opened in June, though Mr. Harris dwells more on the emotions of the rescued than on the motives of the rescuers. Although it is being released theatrically, ''Into the Arms of Strangers'' seems more suited to HBO or PBS, since it follows the standard rhythms of television documentary, rotating among archival film clips and photographs, discreet re-enactments and talking-head interviews, all of them held together by Lee Holdridge's restrained, evocative score and Judi Dench's voice-over narration.</p>
        <p>Assuming that the broad historical context is well enough known, the film concentrates on individual stories. Most of the interviews are with the children, now mostly in their 70's, who recall the overwhelming facts of their childhoods with simple dignity and heart-rending power.</p>
        <p>A dozen kinder, their cheeks creased and their hair mostly gray, recount their happy, generally privileged upbringings before Hitler came to power, and then describe the agony of leaving their parents, the strangeness of England and the tragic aftermath of the war as they tried to rejoin the parents who had had to send them away. Most now live in England and the United States, but they still speak in the fading accents of Central Europe. To see black-and-white pictures of their smiling, smooth faces is to feel the mystifying weight of history and also to sense its bewildering speed. These people come from a different world, but they are also immediately recognizable; they're people we know, even if we can't ever comprehend what they've been through.</p>
        <p>But every story helps us comprehend a little more. Each one is different, of course, but Mr. Harris's subjects have in common a remarkable candor and humor, even when revisiting unbearably painful moments. Kurt Fuchel, born in Vienna and sheltered by a Jewish family in Norwich, has a cherubic face and bubbly demeanor that make his tears when he speaks of his love for his foster parents all the more affecting.</p>
        <p>The writer Lore Segal, whose novel ''Other People's Houses'' is based on her life in a series of English foster homes, regards her uprooted youth, from the fiction-writer's perspective, as a kind of gift. Other survivors speak with fulfillment and pride of their children and grandchildren, their professional lives and their social activism.</p>
        <p>One senses that they are still amazed by their good fortune. While nobody talks of survivor's guilt, they clearly share a sense of responsibility, knowing how many of their friends, family members and contemporaries did not survive. Their participation in this project is an expression of this sentiment.</p>
        <p>The film's affirmation of survival is offered in full awareness of the alternatives. The most devastating testimony comes from Lory Cahn, whose father, unable to part with his beloved daughter, pulled her from the window of the train as it left the platform in Hamburg. She ended up, a few years later, on another train, to Auschwitz.</p>
        <p>''Into the Arms of Strangers'' was produced with the help of the Holocaust Museum in Washington; it is a valuable, if necessarily fragmented, part of that institution's attempt to convey the enormity of what the Nazis did one life at a time.</p>
        <p>''Into the Arms of Strangers'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Its subject matter is intrinsically upsetting.</p>
        <p>INTO THE ARMS OF STRANGERS  Written and directed by Mark Jonathan Harris; director of photography, Don Lenzer; edited by Kate Amend; music by Lee Holdridge; produced by Deborah Oppenheimer; released by Warner Brothers Pictures. Running time: 90 minutes. This film is rated PG.</p>
