        <p>WHITE PLAINS: UTILITY RATE ROLLBACK URGED -- In response to soaring utility bills, the state attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, asked state regulators yesterday to prohibit a power company, Orange and Rockland Utilities, from passing along the increased cost of electricity to its 277,000 customers and to roll back its rates to last year's levels. In a petition filed with the State Public Service Commission, Mr. Spitzer said the utility's average residential bill for July rose from $79.82 in 1999 to $97.91 this year, despite cooler temperatures. Mike Donovan, a spokesman for the utility, said the rates reflected an increase in the price of fuel used to generate electricity. Under deregulation, utilities can pass along such cost increases, said David Flanagan, a commission spokesman. A similar request by Mr. Spitzer involving Con Edison is pending.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: WEST NILE THREAT COOLS -- Cool weather has reduced the threat of West Nile virus, but not ended it, said Neal L. Cohen, the city health commissioner. He said yesterday that five new pools of infected mosquitoes had been found, including two in Central Park, but that all of them held fewer mosquitoes than earlier samples had. He said spraying of the pesticide Anvil would continue until all the mosquitoes were wiped out by freezing temperatures.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: 14 CHARGED WITH ORGANIZED CRIME -- Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn yesterday indicted 14 men, reputedly members of the Colombo crime family, on charges of gambling, loan sharking and extortion.

        <p>MANHATTAN: VIETNAM VETERAN GETS IMMIGRATION HELP -- An immigration judge ordered yesterday that a Dominican native convicted of drug charges be allowed to remain in the United States while he applies for citizenship, because he served as a marine in Vietnam for 23 months. Records show that the Immigration and Naturalization Service sought to deport Luis J. Perez-Portes, 54, who immigrated legally to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1956, because of a conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. But Judge Victoria Ghartey of Immigration Court in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Perez-Portes should remain here because of the ''exceptionally appealing or humanitarian factors'' involved in his case.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: UNION HEAD CRITICIZES CHANCELLOR -- The head of New York City's teachers' union delivered an uncharacteristic rebuke to Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy yesterday, after learning that he had urged principals to evaluate teachers more harshly. Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, issued a statement saying that she ''expected a more thoughtful approach'' from Mr. Levy, whose appointment she had heartily endorsed. Mr. Levy sent an e-mail message to the school system's 1,100 principals last week, suggesting that too few teachers were being fired for incompetence.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: ARREST IN BRIBE ATTEMPT -- A Miami man was charged with drug possession and bribery Wednesday night after trying to pay off officers who found 6 kilograms of cocaine and $231,000 in cash in his car, the police said. Members of the Queens South Street Crime Unit arrested the man, Joseph Victor, 36, after he dropped off a passenger and sped down 107th Avenue with his lights off, running two stop signs, Sgt. Gerald Pizzano said. He said Mr. Victor offered the officers cash they found in the trunk of the car if they would ignore the cocaine.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: A BLOOD CRISIS -- Blood supplies in Connecticut are at emergency levels, according to the state's chapter of the American Red Cross. The organization said there were nearly 1,000 fewer donations per month than in recent years, as well as more stringent screening for blood-borne diseases and rising demand for blood nationally and among the state's hospitals. The Red Cross has asked eligible donors -- people 17 and older who weigh 110 pounds or more and who have not given blood since July 3 -- to donate. by calling (800) 448-3543 or by making an appointment through the group's Web site, www.bloodct.org.</p>
