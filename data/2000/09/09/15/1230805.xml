        <p>SCHWARTZ-Julius, who practiced internal medicine and cardiology for 54 years, died in Hollywood, Fla., on Sept. 6, at the age of 91. The funeral service was private. A 1933 graduate of Syracuse University's College of Medicine (now Upstate Medical University), he was one of that school's oldest surviving graduates. Dr. Schwartz served in the U.S. Army during WWII, receiving the Bronze Star upon his discharge as a Major in 1946. He practiced medicine in Brooklyn for over 30 years, during which time he served as an attending on the staff of Maimonides Hospital and an Asst. Adjunct Professor at Downstate Medical School. In 1975, he relocated to Hollywood, Fla., where he continued to practice medicine until his retirement in 1983. He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Louise Judith of Hollywood, Fla., his daughter, Dr. Susan Schwartz McDonald of Haverford, Pa., and three grandchildren, Elizabeth, Nora, and Geoffrey. Donations in his name may be made to: The Endowed Scholarship on behalf of Julius Schwartz, M.D., Class of 1933, Syracuse Medical Alumni Foundation of Upstate Medical University, 155 Elizabeth Blackwell Street, Suite 306, Syracuse, NY 13210.</p>
