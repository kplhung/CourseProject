        <p>William H. Pitt, a real estate executive and philanthropist, died on Saturday at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 73 and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla.</p>
        <p>He died after a brief illness, his family said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pitt was born in Stamford, Conn., and established the William Pitt Real Estate Company there in 1949, after selling theater tickets and cars. He assisted large companies like GTE, Xerox and Schweppes in moving to Fairfield County during the 1970's. His company, which is privately held, now has 18 sales offices around Connecticut.</p>
        <p>As a philanthropist, he was especially interested in education. His donations included $3 million in 1996 to Sacred Heart University, which was one of the largest gifts ever given by an individual donor to a college or university in Connecticut. The gift helped build The William H. Pitt Health and Recreation Center on the university's principal campus, in Fairfield, Conn.</p>
        <p>His other donations included $1 million to Trinity Catholic High School in Stamford, in memory of his first wife, Theodora Ward Pitt, who died after 45 years of marriage.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, Pauline Baker Pitt, and four stepdaughters, Sandra Pine Doubleday of Hobe Sound, Fla., Hope Pine Kelly of Darien, Conn., Serena Boardman of Manhattan and Samantha Boardman, also of New York City.</p>
