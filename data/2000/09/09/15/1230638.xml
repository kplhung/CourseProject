        <p>Bolstered by findings that even Americans who favor capital punishment worry that innocent people might be put to death, several lawmakers vowed today to renew their push for a law to see that defendants in death-penalty cases have competent lawyers and access to DNA testing.</p>

        <p>Bolstered by findings that even Americans who favor capital punishment worry that innocent people might be put to death, several lawmakers vowed today to renew their push for a law to see that defendants in death-penalty cases have competent lawyers and access to DNA testing.</p>
        <p>''The people are ahead of the politicians,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and a sponsor of the Innocence Protection Act. ''They know the death-penalty machinery is broken.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leahy referred to a survey in mid-August showing that feelings among those who favor capital punishment were far from monolithic. It found 31 percent of the respondents wholeheartedly supported the death penalty, 21 percent totally opposed it and 19 percent were not sure.</p>
        <p>The remaining 29 percent support capital punishment but acknowledged doubts and reservations. And among those who said they were troubled, most were worried about an innocent person being executed.</p>
        <p>The survey of 802 registered voters was conducted jointly by Peter Hart Research, a Democratic research firm, and American Viewpoint, a Republican firm. It had a sampling error of three percentage points and was done for the Justice Project, a national organization that focuses on criminal-justice issues.</p>
        <p>The Innocence Protection Act is intended to assure that states make DNA testing available for capital defendants and to provide more federal money to assure competent counsel. It was introduced in both houses last winter but has not gained traction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leahy and another sponsor, Representative Bill Delahunt, Democrat of Massachusetts, said good defense counsel was even more important than DNA testing.</p>
        <p>''The availability of DNA testing has really shown the inadequacy of counsel,'' Mr. Delahunt said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leahy and Mr. Delahunt are former prosecutors who oppose capital punishment. Two other sponsors, Representative Ray LaHood of Illinois and Senator Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, both Republicans, favor it in principle.</p>
        <p>''My reservations are removed if this bill is passed,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Let's have one standard of justice when it comes to the ultimate remedy.''</p>
