        <p>As college students around the nation began classes earlier this month, the incoming class at Florida's 10 public universities made headlines just by showing up. In the first year that Florida universities stopped using race as a factor in admissions decisions, minority enrollment increased by 12 percent for students entering the system for the first time.</p>
        <p>Last November, I proposed replacing traditional affirmative action policies with race-neutral and legally defensible strategies to expand diversity and opportunity in higher education.</p>
        <p>In recent years, traditional affirmative action has been under attack because it has lost public support and become legally suspect: ballot initiatives in California and Washington state have eliminated affirmative action policies, and federal courts in Georgia and Texas have ruled such practices unconstitutional as applied to state university admissions.</p>
        <p>We have seen how diversity suffers in state universities where policy makers wait until a ballot initiative or court order eliminates affirmative action and we know who has paid the price: racial and ethnic minorities.</p>
        <p>In Florida, we saw the writing on the wall, and did not want to be captive to ballot initiatives and court rulings.</p>
        <p>First, we have replaced race and ethnicity with other admissions criteria that will promote diversity and preserve equal access to state colleges. These include a student's socioeconomic background, geographic diversity, and whether the student comes from a low-performing public school or is a first-generation college student.</p>
        <p>Second, we have increased capacity in the state universities so that we can guarantee admission to every Florida student who graduates in the top 20 percent of his or her high school class.</p>
        <p>Third, we have provided a 43 percent increase in need-based financial aid, an expansion that will make our state colleges far more accessible to low-income students.</p>
        <p>Finally, and perhaps most important, we are devoting unprecedented resources and attention to our lowest-performing primary and secondary schools, where 85 percent of students are African American, Hispanic or other minorities.</p>
        <p>Among other changes, we are making the PSAT available free of charge to all Florida 10th graders. We will also provide free SAT prep courses at the lowest-performing schools, and guarantee students at those schools access to Advance Placement coursework. In addition, every college in the state will be required to establish alliances with low-performing  high schools to improve achievement and college preparedness.</p>
        <p>This plan, called One Florida, can be a model for other states because its goal is to transcend the increasingly tired debate about affirmative action. We intend to prove that government can be race-neutral in its decision-making without turning a blind eye to equal opportunity. While we have moved beyond traditional policies, we have succeeded in increasing the number of minorities enrolled in college. In fact, the freshman class at state universities is the most diverse in state history.</p>
        <p>Along with the practical benefits of such an approach are the intangible  yet significant moral benefits that occur when diversity is achieved with fairness. Every student entering Florida's university system can be confident that achievement, not skin color or ethnic background, is the measure of merit.</p>
