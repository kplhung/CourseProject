        <p>Rick DiPietro will not make his first start in goal Friday night against the Philadelphia Flyers. DiPietro, the 18-year-old whom the Islanders made the top pick in the June draft, will be out 7 to 10 days after he pulled a groin muscle on Wednesday, the final day of camp, in Lake Placid, N.Y.</p>
        <p>He will miss the preseason game against the Devils on Wednesday at Nassau Coliseum and may miss the game against the Washington Capitals on Sept. 23.</p>
        <p>The Islanders, who were so confident in DiPietro that they traded away goalies Kevin Weekes and Roberto Luongo, their No. 1 pick in 1999, are not worried. Tonight's preseason game, a 4-2 split-squad loss to the Flyers with John Vanbiesbrouck in goal, marked the start of a season in which the word playoffs has been batted around with startling frequency for a team that won just 24 games a year ago. The addition of Vanbiesbrouck has taken all the pressure off the rookie, General Manager Mike Milbury said.</p>
        <p>The Islanders will carry three goalies through the preseason. Vanbiesbrouck and Wade Flaherty, who has recovered from shoulder surgery last season, are favored to win the two roster spots, but Milbury said he could not count out DiPietro.</p>
        <p>''I'm certainly not closing the door based on this,'' he said. ''It makes it tougher on the kid. Obviously, the decision depends on how Beezer and Flaherty perform.''</p>
        <p>Vanbiesbrouck stopped 27 shots tonight.</p>
        <p>After the Islanders were purchased by Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar of Computer Associates, the team's payroll was boosted from a league low to a respectable $25 million as the owners acquired the two-time All-Star Roman Hamrlik, defensemen Kevin Haller and Garry Galley, the sniper Mark Parrish and forward Oleg Kvasha.</p>
        <p>''I think we're approaching the season with a lot of confidence and excitement,'' said Mariuz Czerkawski, who scored a power-play goal at 4 minutes 16 seconds of the second period tonight. Mathieu Biron added the other goal for the Islanders. ''You see the changes that were made over the summer, and I think it's a good mix of free agents and young guys.''</p>
        <p>John LeClair scored two goals for the Flyers. Kevin Stevens and Brad Tiley added the others.</p>
