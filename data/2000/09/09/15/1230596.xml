      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Clacking freight trains silhouetted against a fading late autumn sunset, the peripheral blur of trees speeding by a moving boxcar, the hollow glare of anonymous gas stations and bus depots, and the desolation of shabby bars and luncheonettes on the wrong side of the tracks: these are some of the recurrent images that lend Ed Radtke's melancholy road film ''The Dream Catcher'' an enveloping sadness.</p>
        <p>The movie, which opens a one-week engagement today at the Walter Reade Theater as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center's Independent Feature Project, follows the odyssey of two runaway teenage boys scrounging their way across the country, each on his own vaguely defined personal quest. Freddy (Maurice Compte), a handsome, stony-faced brooder, is fleeing a pregnant girlfriend in Philadelphia while searching for the father he barely remembers. Albert (Paddy Connor), who attaches himself to Freddy early in the trip, is a voluble, smart-aleck prankster from Dayton, Ohio, headed for Reno to reunite with a mother he hasn't seen in years.</p>

        <p>The movie, which opens a one-week engagement today at the Walter Reade Theater as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center's Independent Feature Project, follows the odyssey of two runaway teenage boys scrounging their way across the country, each on his own vaguely defined personal quest. Freddy (Maurice Compte), a handsome, stony-faced brooder, is fleeing a pregnant girlfriend in Philadelphia while searching for the father he barely remembers. Albert (Paddy Connor), who attaches himself to Freddy early in the trip, is a voluble, smart-aleck prankster from Dayton, Ohio, headed for Reno to reunite with a mother he hasn't seen in years.</p>
        <p>''The Dream Catcher'' could be described as a ''lost boy'' film as well as a road movie, and the scenes in which the characters poignantly press their noses to the glass of an adult self-sufficiency that seems as unreachable as the stars, will put a lump in your throat. What grown man doesn't remember having been gripped as an adolescent by a sinking feeling when finding himself in a strange situation with only pocket change and no parents hovering nearby? ''The Dream Catcher'' conjures those moments of choked-back anxiety and the strategies for disguising it that range from displays of phony bravado to an impenetrable withdrawal.</p>
        <p>The movie's greatest assets are Mr. Compte's and (especially) Mr. Connor's performances. Mr. Compte deftly deglamorizes a sullen movie stereotype that dates back to James Dean. Mr. Connor's Albert, by turns charming and infuriating, is an impetuous boy-child with a wild streak that grows more reckless as the journey continues. The two actors beautifully evoke the establishment of a fragile fraternal bond that is continually tested by Albert's impulsive acts of rebellion.</p>
        <p>''The Dream Catcher,'' like almost every other road movie, is a schematic patchwork of episodes that wants to piece together an offbeat mosaic of American life. Its gallery of characters includes a Bible-thumping couple of mixed race, the kindly Indian caretaker of a church in which the boys spend the night (Patrick Shining Elk), a raving gun nut, and a divorced nurse (Jeanne Heaton) who takes the boys under her wing late in their odyssey.</p>
        <p>But as one vignette folds into the next, the storytelling often seems forced. Recurrent symbolic images of a white bird furiously beating its wings inside a cage strike a pretentiously false note.</p>
        <p>Early in the film, Freddy visits his ailing, hospital-bound uncle (Larry John Meyers) who informs him that his father, recently discharged from prison, is living in Oklahoma City. Freddy doggedly tracks him down. But when he faces his dad, a gruff, hard-boiled ticket taker in a parking garage, Freddy's volatile reaction doesn't quite ring true. Nor do Albert's antics with a gun he somehow succeeds in stealing from the glove compartment of a hunter who gives the boys a ride.</p>
        <p>Yet for all its small glitches, ''The Dream Catcher'' sustains a mood of aimless adolescent angst, and its vision of the road is uncompromisingly bleak. The dreams luring these teenage drifters into the Wild West are leftover childhood illusions. In the end, there's nothing out there.</p>
