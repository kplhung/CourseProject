        <p>It is one of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's favorite exercises: with laser pointer in hand and a City Hall chamber packed with reporters and top aides, twice a year he runs through dozens of charts that he says illustrate how New York City is in better shape than it has been in decades.</p>
        <p>Yet again, there was much to boast about yesterday, with the mayor proudly pointing to continued declines in everything from crime to welfare rolls to new cases of AIDS and lead poisoning, while emphasizing increases in employment, tourism and recycling.</p>
        <p>But within the more than 800-page report card known as the Mayor's Management Report, there are also hints of at least modest slipping in some important areas, including several of Mr. Giuliani's priorities.</p>
        <p>Murders rose slightly last year. In the 2000 fiscal year that ended on June 30, city streets were a bit less clean and well maintained. Response times to 911 calls increased for crimes in progress and structure fires and for ambulances heading to life-threatening situations. The infant mortality rate climbed slightly. Overtime pay and absenteeism rose among city employees.</p>
        <p>The mayor said he was aware of the ups and some downs, but was confident that over all, the state of the city continued to improve.</p>
        <p>''Some of it shows dramatic improvement, some of it shows some improvement, some shows a little decline,'' he said. ''But there is no question I think the city is doing better now than it was seven or eight years ago, and it's doing better than it was last year.''</p>
        <p>Crime statistics earned first place during the hourlong presentation yesterday, with the mayor noting that despite its status as the nation's largest city, New York last year ranked 165th in per capita crime among the 217 cities with populations exceeding 100,000. In the first six months of this year, crimes in the seven major categories fell 7.8 percent, to 87,309, continuing a pattern over at least eight years.</p>
        <p>But when just murders are counted, the numbers are up slightly, with 671 in 1999, 38 more than in 1998, but still far below the peak of 2,245 in 1990. And response time in the last fiscal year to crimes in progress reached an average of 10.7 minutes, up 3 minutes since 1995.</p>
        <p>The mayor expressed disappointment that absenteeism rose slightly, with the average city employee missing 11.7 days of work during the last fiscal year. Overtime jumped as well, by 16 percent to $654 million, an increase the mayor said was not all bad because part of that cost involved intensified policing.</p>
        <p>His report offered copious evidence of the city's economic boom: 83,800 new jobs in 1999, an estimated 36.7 million tourists and $603 million in grosses at Broadway theaters.</p>
        <p>But there were some signs of declines amid the good news. Complaints against cabdrivers -- related to rudeness, refusals to pick up passengers and other matters -- jumped 7.8 percent, to 14,102. Response time by the Buildings Department to potentially severe complaints rose to 3.5 days in the last fiscal year, up from 1.8 the year before.</p>
        <p>The health statistics were generally positive. New AIDS cases dropped by nearly 20 percent, to 6,284 in 1999. New cases peaked in 1993 at 15,067. Reported rat bites, despite all the recent attention to rat infestation in the city, dropped to 157, down from a peak of 270 in 1991. New cases of tuberculosis and lead poisoning and the hospitalization rate for children with asthma were also down.</p>
        <p>But there was some negative news: the number of AIDS-related deaths increased slightly to 2,028 last year from 1,978, the first rise in five years. Infant mortality rose slightly, to 6.9 per 1,000 live births in 1999, or 848 deaths of infants younger than a year old. The figure was 6.8 in 1998.</p>
        <p>At many points during his presentation, the mayor jabbed at his critics and repeated some of his favorite ideological lines, saying, for example, that with welfare rolls down and employment up, ''there is no better social program than a job.'' In trying to explain why attendance at Yankees games in the Bronx ranked behind that of two other American League teams, the Baltimore Orioles and the Cleveland Indians, he had an answer residents in those cities would be sure to appreciate.</p>
        <p>''Maybe they all go to the baseball stadium because they are afraid of being victims of crime, because their crime rates are higher than ours,'' the mayor crowed.</p>
