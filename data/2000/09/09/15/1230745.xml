        <p>''BLESS THE CHILD,'' starring Kim Basinger, Rufus Sewell and Jimmy Smits. Directed by Chuck Russell (R, 115 minutes). A runny supernatural soap opera -- the first thriller of the ''Touched by an Angel'' era -- that tries for the elegant calm of ''The Sixth Sense'' but fails. It is too often overcome by its flamboyantly cheesy reflexes. Ms. Basinger is the protector aunt of a child (the gifted Holliston Coleman) whose heavenly powers make her the target of an evil cult leader (Mr. Sewell). He means to kill her before Easter; you may feel the need to leave long before then. ''Bless the Child'' seems derivative of so many other movies that you're surprised it doesn't have to credit its sources the way hip-hop artists do when they sample songs. With Mr. Smits as an F.B.I. agent and Ian Holm as a priest who does a laughable steal from ''The Usual Suspects'' (Elvis Mitchell).</p>

With Mr. Smits as an F.B.I. agent and Ian Holm as a priest who does a laughable steal from ''The Usual Suspects'' (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''BRING IT ON,'' starring Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Bradford and Eliza Dushku. Directed by Peyton Reed (PG-13, 110 minutes). Even though it does feature young women bouncing around in skimpy outfits, this cheerleader comedy directed with giddy, sometimes sloppy pep-rally intensity by Mr. Reed from a brisk, slangy script by Jessica Bendinger is more than a low-minded appeal to male lechery. Though bound by the conventions of the sports movie and the teenage romantic comedy, ''Bring It On'' has a fine satirical edge, and at least glances at some serious issues of race and sexuality. It's also a vehicle for the vibrant comic talents of Ms. Dunst, ably supported by Mr. Bradford as her cute, nonconformist love interest, and Ms. Dushku as his sister (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE CELL,'' starring Jennifer Lopez, Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. Directed by Tarsem Singh (R, 110 minutes). A serial killer named Stargher (Mr. D'Onofrio), who abducts women and imprisons them in a Plexiglas cell that slowly fills with water, has a seizure and goes into a coma. His latest victim is trapped in his cell, and she has to be found before the automated torture takes her life. An F.B.I. agent (Mr. Vaughn) talks a child psychologist (Ms. Lopez) into using an experimental technique to enter the killer's subconscious. Mr. Singh's talents haven't quite jelled into storytelling yet. He folds this tale over and over on itself, working with a script that blends elements of ''The Silence of the Lambs,'' ''Manhunter,'' ''The Matrix,'' ''Seven,'' ''Dreamscape'' and ''Spellbound'' with the stop-motion animation of the brothers Quay (''Street of Crocodiles''), the moody photography of Matt Mahurin, the paintings of Francis Bacon and so many other things that there's no there there (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE CREW,'' starring Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds, Dan Hedaya and Seymour Cassel. Directed by Michael Dinner (PG-13, 88 minutes). This sloppy, cliche-ridden comedy about four aging mobsters blundering their way through a series of unlikely capers has moments of wit provided by Barry Fanaro's overplotted script and Mr. Hedaya's priceless goofing. But the picture, with no clear idea of what it wants to do, lurches between slapstick and sentimentality, wasting the talents of Mr. Dreyfuss, Mr. Cassel and Lainie Kazan. Mr. Reynolds, meanwhile, absurdly cast as a New Jersey mafioso, looks as bored and grouchy as the audience will be after 88 minutes of this mess (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''IT ALL STARTS TODAY,'' starring Philippe Torreton. Directed by Bertrand Tavernier (not rated, 117 minutes). Filmed with unassuming realism, beautiful to look at even as it avoids any suggestion of stylishness, Mr. Tavernier's latest film is a passionate and relentless look at how chronic unemployment -- with the usual side effects of alcoholism, domestic abuse and pervasive despair -- menaces the lives of children. Mr. Torreton plays the director of a preschool in a town where the coal mines have been shut down, and the film chronicles his daily battles with bureaucrats, parents and his own pessimism. The film avoids both sentimentality and cynical despair; Mr. Torreton's character refuses to succumb to hopelessness, but he also refuses to rule it out (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''MADADAYO,'' starring Tatsuo Matsumura. Directed by Akira Kurosawa (not rated, 134 minutes). In the course of his long career, Kurosawa, who died in 1998, made a  number of great movies. His last film, ''Madadayo,'' released in Japan in 1993, lacks the narrative intensity of emotional range to be considered among his masterpieces, but within its own modest proportions it achieves a  kind of perfection. The story is not much: a retired professor in postwar Tokyo lives out his twilight years in the glow of his former students' devotion and declares his unreadiness to say farewell to the life he lives with humor and gusto. But Kurosawa's absolute assurance as a filmmaker and his unabashed affection for his characters make ''Madadayo'' a richly, and in a way inexplicably, satisfying movie (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''NURSE BETTY,'' starring Morgan Freeman, Renee Zellweger, Chris Rock and Greg Kinnear. Directed by Neil LaBute (R, 112 minutes). Alternately hilarious, poignant and gory, this modern fairy tale that follows an aspiring nurse (Ms. Zellweger), suffering from traumatic amnesia, to Los Angeles to win the love of her favorite soap-opera character is a contemporary ''Wizard of Oz.'' Hollywood is the Emerald City. Mr. Kinnear is the self-centered actor who plays her heart's desire on  television. Mr. Freeman and Mr. Rock are a sadly introspective hit man and his hot-headed protege who follow her across the country with intention to do harm. This may be the  deepest and funniest American comedy since David O. Russell's ''Flirting With Disaster'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY,'' starring Steve Harvey, D. L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac. Directed by Spike Lee (R, 117 minutes). Filmed before a live audience on two nights in February in Charlotte, N.C., the self-proclaimed Kings of Comedy swagger across the stage, urban legends in resplendent outfits. Until a couple of years ago the comedians' exposure was limited mostly to cable television. Here their comedy gives audiences that have never seen anything like it a hilarious window on a new world. They display their chops when they talk about family, specifically African-American family with roots in the South (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE REPLACEMENTS,'' starring Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman. Directed by Howard Deutch (PG-13, 105 minutes). This negligible jock comedy, about a group of misfit macho clowns who suit up for pro football during a players' strike, just wants to be loved: Is that so wrong? This rehashed and desperate picture stars Mr. Reeves as the honorable, stoic fill-in quarterback. (He glides through.) Mr. Hackman musters his requisite command as the honorable, stoic fill-in coach in a wardrobe from the Tom Landry Collection, mouthing dialogue from ''Hoosiers'' and old United Airlines commercials. The unvaried ragtag scab players include a pair of violent bodyguard brothers (Faison Love and Michael Taliferro), a violent cop (Jon Favreau) and a violent felon on loan to the league (Michael Jace). Brooke Langton is the cheerleader who resolves not to date players and dates Mr. Reeves anyway. It's a peculiarity from L.A., a union town: a film that celebrates antiunion activity (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''SAVING GRACE,'' starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson. Directed by Nigel Cole (R, 93 minutes). This innocuous piece of comic Anglophilia features the usual cast of lovable British eccentrics plopped down in a picturesque seaside spot, in this case a Cornish village. Ms. Blethyn is Grace, a widow whose husband committed suicide, leaving her $450,000 in debt and in danger of losing her lovely stone house. She and her resourceful gardener (Mr. Ferguson, who also wrote the screenplay) convert her greenhouse into a marijuana farm, and the resulting high jinks resemble a twee hybrid of ''The Full Monty'' and the lesser works of Cheech and Chong (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''SOLAS,'' starring Maria Galiana and Ana Fernandez. Written and directed by Benito Zambrano (not rated, 98 minutes). When a simple Spanish woman (Ms. Galiana) makes a rare journey to the city to be with her husband, who is having surgery, she stays with her embittered, alcoholic daughter (Ms. Fernandez) who works for a cleaning service. Ms. Galiana's eloquent, utterly unsentimental portrayal of a woman who expects little of life is an extraordinarily moving portrait of unconditional love gradually working its wonders (Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''SPACE COWBOYS,'' starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner (PG-13, 105 minutes). Directed by Mr. Eastwood. The second half of Mr. Eastwood's new movie is a pleasant reworking of the standard trouble-in-space movie, with Mr. Eastwood himself leading a heroic team of astronauts that also includes Mr. Jones, Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Garner. But the first half, which consists of the comic, tough-old-guy interplay among these four sublime actors, is a boisterous, easygoing tribute to manhood and maturity. Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Jones are in especially fine form, as are Marcia Gay Harden, playing a NASA engineer, and James Cromwell as (once again) the villainous bureaucrat who tries to deny the old-timers their shot at celestial glory (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE TAO OF STEVE,'' starring Donal Logue and Greer Goodman. Directed by Jenniphr Goodman (R, 87 minutes). The ''Steve'' in the title refers to the spiritual embodiment of cool as exemplified by Steve McQueen, Steve McGarrett (''Hawaii Five-O'') and Steve Austin (''The Six Million Dollar Man''), a goal to which the blobby and amiable Dex aspires. In this light-as-a-marshmallow romantic comedy, Dex (Mr. Logue) has lined up quotes from Heidegger, Thomas Aquinas and ''Don Giovanni'' to rationalize his aimless pleasure-seeking in this rather aimless movie. Mr. Logue's performance as a nice-guy player -- his weight doesn't keep him from scoring with the ladies -- makes the movie glide. Dex has a cherub's glee over what he gets away with. The movie becomes a lot less interesting when it rolls around to the inevitable quest for a steady relationship with a woman (Ms. Goodman) whose feelings were trampled in Dex's compulsive fox hunting. ''Tao'' can't redeem the moves to its predictable end, but its protagonist has a great time getting there (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE WATCHER,'' starring Keanu Reeves, James Spader and Marisa Tomei. Directed by Joe Charbanic (R, 93 minutes). Mr. Reeves enunciates, Mr. Spader frets and Ms. Tomei just looks tired in this pretentious, incoherent compilation of serial-killer cliches and warmed-over MTV-style visual flourishes. Mr. Reeves is a sadistic, diabolically intelligent strangler, Mr. Spader the F.B.I. agent whose psychic torment is the killer's real turn-on, and Ms. Tomei is the agent's kindly therapist (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''THE WAY OF THE GUN,'' starring Ryan Phillippe, Benicio Del Toro and Juliette Lewis. Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie (R, 120 minutes). This film feels like a more violent and grim version of a Coen brothers film; it could be Quentin Tarantino's ''Raising Arizona.'' Its lead characters are small-time criminals who tend to speak in ambitious and hilariously orotund turns of phrase. The two, um, heroes, while visiting a sperm bank, hatch a plan to kidnap a young woman doing surrogate mother duty for a wealthy couple. ''Gun'' is a stylish and intelligent film noir built around the feelings adults have about babies, climaxing with a childbirth and a lengthy gunfight and standoff (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>''RIDE LONESOME: A BUDD BOETTICHER RETROSPECTIVE.'' At the age of 84, Budd Boetticher, whose life has taken him from gridiron at Ohio State to the bullring as a professional matador to Hollywood as a writer, producer and director, is receiving what is billed as his first New York retrospective. In a career that began in the 1940's, Mr. Boetticher became best known for modestly budgeted films notable for their male antagonists, their narrative drive and their visual beauty. In particular, he was well regarded for a series of westerns that starred Randolph Scott. Highlighting the first of three weekends devoted to Mr. Boetticher's career are the screenings on Sunday at the American Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, at 2 p.m. of ''The Bullfighter and the Lady'' (1951) and ''Ride Lonesome'' (1959). The former, starring Robert Stack, is Mr. Boetticher's semiautobiographical tale of an American in Mexico who learns bullfighting to impress a woman. The latter, with Scott and James Coburn (in his debut), deals with a taciturn bounty hunter who enlists a widow and a couple of outlaws in a quest for vengeance. The series, which begins tomorrow, continues through Oct. 1 at the museum, at 34-12 36th Street, at 35th Avenue. Admission is $8.50 for adults, $5.50 for people over 65 and students with ID, $4.50 for children from 5 to 18 and free to children 4 and under. Information: (718) 784-0077 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
