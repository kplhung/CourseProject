        <p>Murat Kilic summoned all the bravado a 14-year-old could muster, shook his head back and forth vigorously and said he never liked school anyway and he was proud to be working to help support his family.</p>
        <p>Then, as he watched his friends clowning around nearby, his facade collapsed in a deep shrug of his frail shoulders.</p>
        <p>''It's hard and dirty work,'' he said, displaying the scars and calluses on his hands from toiling in a metal-fabrication shop 10 hours a day for $200 a month. ''I'm there -- and they are learning something in school.''</p>
        <p>About 14 million children started the new school year across Turkey this week, donning uniforms and filling overcrowded classrooms. But a million other children were not there. Instead, most were working in factories, fields, shops and the streets.</p>
        <p>Like Murat, many of these children dropped out of school at the end of the fifth grade before the government raised compulsory attendance to eighth grade two years ago. Thousands of other children never start school.</p>
        <p>Some of the reasons are the same as in other developing countries. Many children are needed to earn money for their families, or they stay at home and take care of siblings while their parents work. Others come from families that do not value formal education.</p>
        <p>But other factors have shut the school door for large segments of the Turkish population. A new report by the World Bank said most of the country's 30,000 villages do not have a school that goes beyond fifth grade. To continue their education, students must commute by bus to another town or go to a boarding school. Both options are often too expensive for poor families.</p>
        <p>The analysis also found that girls, particularly those from poor rural families, are twice as likely as boys to drop out before finishing eighth grade. Nearly half the women are illiterate in southeastern Turkey, the poorest region, the bank said.</p>
        <p>Even in richer urban areas like Istanbul or Ankara, poor people who want to send their children to school face difficulties. The uniforms that are mandatory at most public schools cost $75 to $80, and families must pay at least as much for textbooks and other basic supplies because schools do not get enough money from the government.</p>
        <p>On top of those costs, parents who want their children to attend good public schools are often required to pay $200 to $300 a year under the table for each child for additional expenses that are not covered by the government.</p>
        <p>The schools themselves are overcrowded and teachers are underpaid. The average class size is 64 pupils, and Turkey's 525,000 teachers earn an average of about $300 a month, according to statistics from the education workers union. That is hardly above the country's per capita income of $3,000 a year.</p>
        <p>''Turkey needs 190,000 more teachers and 106,000 more classrooms and only then can we have 30 kids to a class,'' said Alaattin Dincer, president of the education union.</p>
        <p>But instead of increasing, the percentage of government budgets spent for education has declined steadily in the last decade to a level below the standard of countries with comparable income, the World Bank analysis said.</p>
        <p>The national government, which provides the money for education, has been increasing military defense spending instead, although the Ministry of Education said that 152,000 new teachers had been hired in the last four years in an attempt to reduce overcrowding and that there were plans to hire more next year.</p>
        <p>While Germany spends $817 per student annually and Greece $240, Turkey spends only $90.</p>
        <p>No one understands those statistics more clearly than Mehmet Kapuca, the principal of the elementary school in this poor village.</p>
        <p>When the doors of Huseyin Tolgacan Sipahi Elementary School opened this week, he was confronted by 1,876 pupils in eight grades. They are deployed in double shifts, with half starting at 7:30 in the morning and the others at 12:50 in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>And the crowded classrooms defy most prescriptions for good learning. The older pupils are jammed 80 to a classroom, with a single teacher. Even in the smallest classroom, for 50 first graders, three children share each desk.</p>
        <p>''It's a very hard job to teach here and to go to school here,'' Mr. Kapuca said as he rifled through drawings for a badly needed new school, something that was promised years ago.</p>
        <p>Many of Yenidogan's 5,000 or so residents fled rural areas for this extended suburb about 20 miles southeast of Istanbul. They live in half-finished houses and struggle to find the money to send their children to school.</p>
        <p>Pointing to a stack of textbooks in his office, Mr. Kapuca said donations had provided some books for the poorest children, and collections are taken up for their uniforms.</p>
        <p>Murat Kilic would have been wearing the tie and blazer of an eighth grader at Huseyin Tolgacan Sipahi had he not left to help support three brothers and sisters. Instead of rising before dawn to accompany his father to the metal shop where they work side by side, he would have been sitting alongside his friends, snickering at slides of the human body or struggling to understand a math problem.</p>
        <p>He said he had never liked school and did not miss it, but he pretended to be sick Monday and Tuesday to skip work and hang out with his friends after they finished classes. And when they put their bags on the dirty field to play, he admonished them to be more careful with the books inside.</p>
