        <p>The General Motors Corporation doubled its stake in the Suzuki Motor Corporation to 20 percent today and G.M.'s top executive joined Suzuki's board.</p>
        <p>The deal, announced by the two automakers in Tokyo, expanded a close relationship between them that goes back almost 20 years, when Suzuki first began supplying small cars to G.M., the world's largest automotive company.</p>
        <p>G.M. is hoping that Suzuki will help increase its share of the market in Asia, where the automotive industry is expected to grow the fastest in the next several years.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to build on that history of relationship with General Motors,'' said Osamu Suzuki, chairman and chief executive of Suzuki, who appeared at a news conference with his G.M. counterpart, John F. Smith Jr.</p>
        <p>In agreeing to name Mr. Smith as a nonexecutive director of Suzuki, Mr. Suzuki said: ''We wanted someone who could advise us on areas of strategic importance. We are grateful to get an excellent person.''</p>
        <p>The Suzuki-G.M. deal is the latest in a series of transactions by foreign automakers to gain a greater presence in Japan. DaimlerChrysler A.G. has arranged to take a 34 percent ownership stake in Mitsubishi Motors.</p>
        <p>The Ford Motor Company has control of the Mazda Motor Corporation, and Renault of France holds a 37 percent interest in the Nissan Motor Company.</p>
        <p>G.M. also holds stakes in Isuzu Motors Ltd. and Subaru, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. But the G.M.-Suzuki alliance is characterized by unusually close personal relations between the two chairmen, who have known each other since G.M. and Suzuki first entered into an alliance in 1981.</p>
        <p>Takaki Nakanishi, an automotive analyst with Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, said the choice of Mr. Smith as a board member ''showed G.M. had no intention to control'' Suzuki management.</p>
        <p>Suzuki also differs from several of its larger Japanese competitors in that it is financially strong, unencumbered by heavy debts or sluggish sales. Digging deep into the small- car niche, it has carved a firm presence in Japan and overseas markets and has not lost money since 1949.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suzuki and Mr. Smith said they considered the relationship a strategic partnership and that Suzuki would remain independent.</p>
        <p>Analysts said a small-car manufacturer like Suzuki was now more important to G.M. than ever in its strategy to build a greater presence in Asian markets, especially after the company lost in a bidding war with Ford over the acquisition of Daewoo Motors of South Korea.</p>
        <p>''Our future depends on the success in Asia,'' said Rudolph Schlais, president of G.M.'s Asia-Pacific operations, who attended the news conference.</p>
        <p>In an important step toward working cooperatively to expand in Asia, Suzuki will start manufacturing YGM-1, a jointly developed minicar between G.M. and Suzuki, in a plant in Kosai, a city near Mount Fuji west of Tokyo, in September 2001.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suzuki, 70, has been chief executive of Suzuki Motor since 1978.</p>
        <p>Asked which side first proposed raising the G.M. stake to 20 percent, Mr. Suzuki responded, ''That was done by 'a un no kokyu' with Mr. Smith,'' using a Japanese expression that roughly translates into they ''knew each other's thoughts without using any words.''</p>
