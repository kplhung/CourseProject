        <p>Saying that he was noting the first anniversary of the release from prison of members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani criticized President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday for their positions on the action.</p>
        <p>''We're here to point out that this is the one-year anniversary of one of the most disgraceful things that has happened in the last 100 years by a president of the United States,'' the mayor said at a news conference arranged with the Republican National Committee in City Hall Park.</p>

        <p>Saying that he was noting the first anniversary of the release from prison of members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani criticized President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday for their positions on the action.</p>
        <p>''We're here to point out that this is the one-year anniversary of one of the most disgraceful things that has happened in the last 100 years by a president of the United States,'' the mayor said at a news conference arranged with the Republican National Committee in City Hall Park.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani criticized Mr. Clinton for granting clemency to members of the group, the F.A.L.N., who were released last Sept. 10, and for trying at the same time to boost Mr. Gore's standing with Puerto Rican voters. He criticized Mr. Gore for not taking a position on the issue. Then he criticized Mrs. Clinton for changing her position.</p>
        <p>Last year, in what the first lady later called an early campaign stumble, Mrs. Clinton broke with her husband and said his clemency offer should be withdrawn. The resulting outcry from Puerto Rican voters went on for weeks.</p>
        <p>It was unclear why Mr. Giuliani felt the need to hold a news conference more than a full year after members of the group had been released from prison. Representative Rick A. Lazio did mention the group in his debate with Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday night, in a discussion about clemency, but did not link his opponent directly to the group. Democrats happily speculated yesterday that the mayor was eager to get back into the good graces of the Senate campaign of Mr. Lazio, who replaced Mr. Giuliani in the race. On Monday, Mr. Giuliani criticized Mr. Lazio for heartily shaking Yasir Arafat's hand during a visit to the Middle East. Mr. Lazio's campaign was not pleased, but Mrs. Clinton's was.</p>
        <p>''I love Rudy Giuliani,'' a senior campaign adviser to Mrs. Clinton said afterward.</p>
        <p>Republicans said that the mayor's criticism of the Clintons and Mr. Gore yesterday had nothing to do with his statements on Monday.</p>
        <p>''Rudy Giuliani's a good Republican,'' said Bill Pascoe, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. Both the mayor and Republican officials said the mayor had long ago offered to speak out on the issue. Mr. Giuliani, a former prosecutor, has been one of the most vocal critics of Mr. Clinton's clemency offer.</p>
        <p>''This is an issue I felt very strongly about when I was running for, considering running, involved in the race for the Senate, whatever you want to describe it, whatever I was doing,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''So some time ago I said to them, at an appropriate time, I would like to speak out on this.'' Mr. Gore, the mayor noted, was campaigning in the city yesterday. He added that Republicans ''felt that this was an appropriate time to do it.''</p>
