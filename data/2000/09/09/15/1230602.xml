        <p>It may almost be too late for the French photo team known as Pierre et Gilles to get the credit they deserve in the United States. The cross-pollination between high and popular culture that they exemplify has accelerated so dizzyingly over the last decade that their exquisitely hand-finished photographs of impossibly, sometimes scarily, beautiful men and women seem oddly creaky and routine. At the same time, it may also be too soon to know just what credit Pierre et Gilles are owed.</p>
        <p>The team's 56-work retrospective at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo is a long overdue introduction. It's their first major museum show in the United States, coming a decade after a single gallery show, at Hirschl &amp; Adler Modern in 1990. Organized by Dan Cameron, senior curator at the New Museum, it is a must-see for anyone interested in the intertwining histories of postmodern (especially set-up) photography, fashion photography, commercial illustration, the male nude in art and the emergence of a gay sensibility -- histories in which Pierre et Gilles figure to a greater or lesser degree, depending on who is talking.</p>

        <p>It may almost be too late for the French photo team known as Pierre et Gilles to get the credit they deserve in the United States. The cross-pollination between high and popular culture that they exemplify has accelerated so dizzyingly over the last decade that their exquisitely hand-finished photographs of impossibly, sometimes scarily, beautiful men and women seem oddly creaky and routine. At the same time, it may also be too soon to know just what credit Pierre et Gilles are owed.</p>
        <p>The team's 56-work retrospective at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo is a long overdue introduction. It's their first major museum show in the United States, coming a decade after a single gallery show, at Hirschl &amp; Adler Modern in 1990. Organized by Dan Cameron, senior curator at the New Museum, it is a must-see for anyone interested in the intertwining histories of postmodern (especially set-up) photography, fashion photography, commercial illustration, the male nude in art and the emergence of a gay sensibility -- histories in which Pierre et Gilles figure to a greater or lesser degree, depending on who is talking.</p>
        <p>The problem is that this show is too small to account for the activities of this prolific duo, who are now in their 40's and have been a couple and a collaborative team since 1976. (While they plan the images and their often elaborate stagings together, Pierre, who trained as a photographer, takes the pictures, while Gilles, trained as a painter, applies the painted highlights; contrary to appearances there is no digital work involved.) Over the last quarter-century they have applied their peculiar mix of techniques, and of camp and kitsch and sacred and erotic, to an ecumenical range of media: album and magazine covers, fashion photography, commercial illustration and celebrity portraiture.</p>
        <p>They have given us Catherine Deneuve as a fairy princess with a painted-on tiara, Iggy Pop as a foppish visionary with a pancake complexion and crazed blue eyes. They have portrayed friends, models and stars as biblical and mythological characters ranging from Adam and Eve to Medusa.</p>
        <p>They have revisited academic painting genres (the exotic beggar boy, for example) and raided non-Western cultures (the Indian movie poster, for one). And repeatedly they have provided lavish updates on the beefcake tradition, bringing an unusual mix of blatant seductiveness and innocence to images of beautiful young men cast as Roman centurions, Greek sea gods, hustlers, sailors and cowboys. Throughout, they have had a thriving gallery career, at least in Europe: however widely reproduced, their photographs are always one of a kind and encased in elaborate, often glitzy custom-made frames.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to another problem: this exhibition's seeming intent to present the artists as avatars of the avant-garde and the somewhat isolated atmosphere that results. Pierre et Gilles are stars in France and Europe because of their fairly constant presence in the mass media. But there is no sense of the media, of the street, in this exhibition, even though some of the images on view have appeared on magazine and album covers. It might have helped if the catalog or the installation had provided a fuller, messier sense of the context in which their work habitually appears.</p>
        <p>The clean, lean installation certainly enables the visitor to savor the peculiar hothouse intensity of the images, and until a larger show comes along, to form a few opinions, not all of which may be completely reconcilable.</p>
        <p>One opinion is that Pierre et Gilles, rather than being avant-garde artists, are the sole occupants of a category of their own devising, a hermetically sealed, time-warped middle ground between high art and popular culture. From this vantage point they have ignored both, pursuing a vision of otherworldly beauty steeped in artifice and historical consciousness and charged with an erotic current that is often but not always explicitly gay.</p>
        <p>They share concerns and characteristics with many other artists of the 1970's and 80's, including Gilbert and George, Robert Mapplethorpe, Annie Liebovitz, Yasumasa Morimura, Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons. Their elaborately staged images also stand as precedents for younger photo artists like Gregory Crewdson, Catherine Opie, Matthew Barney and Mariko Mori. And their emphasis on idealized images of beautiful young men has undoubtedly influenced the increased visibility of the male body in fashion photography.</p>
        <p>But these connections don't alter their basic isolation. For one thing, their work seems protected by a not-so-invisible shield of artistic conservatism; it is deliberately, almost exultantly retro, which may account for its popularity. Its retrievals don't so much parody or revitalize forms like the hand-tinted photograph or mass-produced images of saints as pay heartfelt homage to them or simply embalm them. There is not, for example, a shred of irony in the beatific, softly lighted image of a slim black man in a monk's habit who portrays St. Martin, even though some of the animals gathered around him look as though they came from the taxidermist.</p>
        <p>Looking at this show becomes a process of seeking out the works that, like St. Martin, have escaped the embalming process for one reason or another and managed to breathe as art objects. Sometimes survival is mostly due to the subject's force of personality, as with the imperious glare of Eliane Pine Caringhton, an artist who stands before a deep orange wall draped in pearls, looking like Coco Chanel on a good jewel day despite his 5 o'clock shadow. In other instances the painting seems to take over completely. A jaundiced Medusa backed by greenish feather-boa clouds achieves a classic aura of evil because it is so thoroughly overpainted that it resembles a lithograph and not a photograph of a real person at all.</p>
        <p>In contrast, a large recent image of a melancholy male nude in a rocky grotto is effective because the mist that gives the image such mysterious depth is clearly painted and stands out against the photographic quality of the rest of the image. This sense of the techniques of painting and photography being pulled far enough apart that a perceptible gap exists between them also animates ''Dans le Port du Havre'' This image, which is hands down the show's best, features an angelic young sailor up to his chest in water rich with gleaming bubbles and the harbor lights and a florid night sky behind him. Like the grotto image, it dates from 1998, and it takes the indefatigable Pierre et Gilles into new territory that they would do well to explore.</p>
        <p>''Pierre et Gilles'' is at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222, through Jan. 7.</p>
