        <p>Directed by John Hancock</p>
        <p>Not rated; 106 minutes</p>
        <p>Warning signs for urban audiences ought to be posted at theaters playing ''A Piece of Eden'': ''Danger! You are entering an irony-free zone.''</p>
        <p>Yes, this is the kind of movie in which there is a character named Happy, and she is, too. The title is an unabashed expression of the feelings of the filmmaker, John Hancock, and his screenwriter (and wife), Dorothy Tristan, toward the Indiana apple farm where the director grew up and where this film has been photographed.</p>
        <p>''A Piece of Eden'' has sincerity, warmth and a few cliche-shattering surprises. Though its tone is one of homemade simplicity, it is not at all a naive work: Mr. Hancock is a film and theater veteran whose work includes the early Robert De Niro vehicle ''Bang the Drum Slowly'' and the cult horror film ''Let's Scare Jessica to Death.''</p>
        <p>The film is a homecoming for Mr. Hancock, as it is for his central, semi-autobiographical character, Bob Tredici (Marc Grapey), a New York television publicist who is called home to Indiana when his father, Franco (Robert Breuler), is severely burned in an accident.</p>
        <p>Bob decides to stick around while his father recovers, partly because his business in New York isn't going so well and partly because he is envious of his cousin, Greg (Jeff Puckett), who has put himself in line to take over the family orchard. With his father confined to a hospital bed, Bob takes it upon himself to update the operation of the orchard, introducing a computer and modern marketing techniques.</p>
        <p>To convince his father that he is a stable, responsible individual, Bob asks his secretary, the aforementioned Happy (Rebecca Harrell), to come to the farm and pose as his wife. As played by Ms. Harrell (who, as an 8-year-old, starred in Mr. Hancock's Christmas fantasy ''Prancer''), Happy is a big, bright beach ball of a woman who immediately charms the entire Tredici clan.</p>
        <p>Just as ''A Piece of Eden'' threatens to sink into deep treacle, something amazing happens. Instead of getting his comeuppance and finding redemption in the simple ways of honest country folk, Bob turns out to be right. By transforming the orchard into a sophisticated tourist attraction, complete with a petting zoo and cherry pit-spitting contests, the city slicker saves the day.</p>
        <p>Commercial calculation, for what may be the first time in film history,  emerges as a force for good -- a refreshingly unhypocritical attitude on the part of Mr. Hancock, who clearly sees no contradiction between his love for nature and his affection for show business.</p>
        <p>As father and son, Mr. Breuler and Mr. Grapey, both veterans of the Chicago theater, deliver engaging, understated performances, and they are supported by a few more familiar performers -- Tyne Daly, Frederic Forrest, the soap opera star Tristan Rogers -- who seem to have dropped in as a favor to Mr. Hancock.</p>
        <p>At its best, ''A Piece of Eden''  finds a delicate balance between urban and rural values, progress and tradition, between experience and innocence.</p>
