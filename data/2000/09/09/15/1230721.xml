        <p>Canada's annual inflation rate slowed to 2.5 percent in August from 3 percent in June, as the rise in energy prices abated. Economists had expected less than the half-point drop in the consumer price index for August, but warned that the latest jump in oil prices would push it higher again for September. Excluding energy, Canada's inflation rate was 1.7 percent in August, up slightly from 1.5 percent in July. Energy costs are 11.9 per cent higher than a year ago.</p>
