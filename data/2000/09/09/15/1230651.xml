        <p>The United States soccer team's loss at Costa Rica on July 23 in a World Cup qualifying game turned out to be more severe than the result. Yesterday, the world governing body of soccer suspended Coach Bruce Arena for three qualifying matches and Claudio Reyna, the team captain, for two for arguing with officials after the 2-1 loss.</p>
        <p>Arena and Reyna argued vehemently with the Jamaican referee, Peter Prendergast, for awarding a penalty kick to Costa Rica in the final minute, which led to its victory.</p>
        <p>Reyna's suspension is final, but the United States Soccer Federation is investigating whether it can appeal Arena's suspension. Soccer's governing body, FIFA, usually shows little tolerance for those who argue with officials of qualifying games or make accusatory remarks to the news media about them.</p>
        <p>Prendergast called a penalty kick on defender Gregg Berhalter for handling the ball in the penalty area. The Americans contended that the ball went off Berhalter's shoulder.</p>
        <p>''The game in Costa Rica was an emotional defeat for us, and our reactions to that loss were equally emotional,'' Arena said in a statement. ''We acknowledge and understand FIFA's decision in this process, and we need to put it behind us and move forward in our preparation for these upcoming games.''</p>
        <p>The suspensions mean Arena and three key players will miss the return encounter with Costa Rica on Oct. 11 in Columbus, Ohio. Earnie Stewart and Eddie Lewis will also miss that game because of their actions in a 1-0 victory over Guatemala on Sept. 3 in Washington.</p>
        <p>Stewart drew his second yellow card in the game against Guatemala and Lewis was ejected for elbowing a Guatemalan player seven minutes after he entered the game as a substitute in the 57th minute.</p>
        <p>The United States may choose to use Tab Ramos of the MetroStars as the team's main playmaker.</p>
        <p>With two games remaining in the regional semifinal group, the Americans are second in the group with 7 points, 2 behind Costa Rica.</p>
