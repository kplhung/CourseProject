        <p>Paychecks Bounce At Rainbow Room</p>
        <p>There are signs of more clouds at the Rainbow Room, a part of the Cipriani food empire. Waiters and other staffers were dumbfounded that some late August paychecks bounced.</p>
        <p>The Rainbow Room, high above Rockefeller Center, charges $29 for a bowl of pasta, and a banquet can cost $800 a head. Yet paychecks as low as $140 have been returned, stamped ''Unpaid.''</p>
        <p>''In 15 years at this union, I've never seen checks bounce,'' said John Turchiano, a spokesman for Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Local 6, representing the workers.</p>
        <p>GIUSEPPE CIPRIANI dismisses the whole matter as an accounting problem. One supplier, Broadway Famous Party Rental, upset over an unpaid bill for about $500,000, attached a lien to the payroll account, he said.</p>
        <p>The dispute was settled for about $350,000 and then the checks cleared, he said. ''The Rainbow Room is not in trouble,'' Mr. Cipriani said. ''It is actually doing very well.''</p>
        <p>Broadway Famous Party Rental had no comment.</p>
        <p>The staff is edgy. ''Even the checks for the sous-chefs bounced,'' said BOB THOMAS, a waiter and union delegate.</p>
        <p>Just last year, in a fight over hiring lasting eight months, the union picketed the renowned Rainbow Room plus the family's SoHo restaurant and Cipriani 42nd Street, another banquet hall.</p>
        <p>Upstaged by a Cat Who Isn't There</p>
        <p>The screening that the producer JANE ROSENTHAL held for 100 people at the TriBeCa Grand for the movie ''Meet the Parents'' on Wednesday night turned into a cross-continental bazaar of actors, studio chiefs and politicians. But everyone yakked about the cat, mostly.</p>
        <p>The movie stars ROBERT DE NIRO, whom Universal Studios flew down for the night from Canada, where he is filming ''The Score,'' a heist story, with MARLON BRANDO. Other cast members on hand included BEN STILLER, BLYTHE DANNER, TERI POLO and PHYLLIS GEORGE, who was with CHARLES A. GARGANO, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gargano invited GOV. GEORGE E. PATAKI, who showed up after the movie because he watched the Clinton-Lazio debate and was crowing that Mr. Lazio had clearly won. LISA CAPUTO, Hillary Rodham Clinton's former spokeswoman, showed up late for the same reason and begged to differ.</p>
        <p>EDGAR BRONFMAN JR., whose family business, the Seagram Company, is expected to be sold along with Universal Studios to a French conglomerate, was there along with RON MEYER, the studio president, and PIERRE LESCURE, the chairman of Canal Plus, who would run Universal.</p>
        <p>JAY ROACH, director of the two Austin Powers movies, directed ''Parents,'' which centers on a guy (Mr. Stiller) meeting his girlfriend's father (Mr. De Niro), who obsesses over a Himalayan cat named Mr. Jinx.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roach said Mr. De Niro doted on Mr. Jinx, actually played by three different cats, and tried to insert the animal into every scene.</p>
        <p>Anyone Misplace 3 Bronze Nudes?</p>
        <p>If you lost a statue in New York, phone home.</p>
        <p>The photographer TIMOTHY WHITE, whose studio is in the new frontier, West 37th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues, discovered Wednesday night that someone had deposited a large bronze statue on the north sidewalk.</p>
        <p>The life-size bronze features a naked man and woman kissing and fondling each other on a bench while another unclad woman sits nearby, consumed with ennui.</p>
        <p>The statue covers about eight square feet, but has neither an identifying plaque nor any indication of the sculptor. Mr. White said no one on the street seems to have seen it put there.</p>
        <p>''It has nothing to do with the neighborhood or anything around it,'' he said.</p>
