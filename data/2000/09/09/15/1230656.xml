        <p>Democratic Congressional Campaign charges that Mark Nielsen, Republican candidate in Connecticut's Fifth District, is volating federal campaign finance laws by paying rent at below-market rates for his campaign headquarters in Watertown, which is owned by Anthony Cocchiola, a campaign contributor; Rep James H Maloney, Democrat, has been complaining since June that the building is not even in the district; photo (M)</p>

        <p>There would almost certainly be  nothing to say about the nondescript one-story office building here that is  the campaign headquarters for Mark Nielsen, the Republican Congressional candidate -- nothing, that is, if it were in Mr. Nielsen's district.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, though, the building is about 400 feet from his district, the Fifth, a point that Mr. Nielsen's opponent, Representative James H. Maloney, has been mentioning since June. And this afternoon, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee filed a complaint accusing Mr. Nielsen of violating federal campaign finance laws by paying rent at below-market rates to a landlord who is also a contributor.</p>

        <p>There would almost certainly be  nothing to say about the nondescript one-story office building here that is  the campaign headquarters for Mark Nielsen, the Republican Congressional candidate -- nothing, that is, if it were in Mr. Nielsen's district.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, though, the building is about 400 feet from his district, the Fifth, a point that Mr. Nielsen's opponent, Representative James H. Maloney, has been mentioning since June. And this afternoon, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee filed a complaint accusing Mr. Nielsen of violating federal campaign finance laws by paying rent at below-market rates to a landlord who is also a contributor.</p>
        <p>The complaint was filed in Washington with the Federal Election Commission, only hours after the Nielsen campaign unleashed its latest attack on Mr. Maloney over the 1997 conviction of his brother, Robert, on 17 counts of campaign finance violations.</p>
        <p>On Monday, President Clinton visited Connecticut to campaign with Mr. Maloney, heightening interest in the race and intensifying emotions on both sides.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maloney, in an interview, acknowledged that he had become fed up with the Nielsen campaign's use of his brother's arrest but noted that his campaign first criticized the location of the Nielsen headquarters and alleged improprieties related to the rent back in June.</p>
        <p>The Maloney campaign's Web site shows photos of the Nielsen headquarters and a running clock showing how long it has been occupied.</p>
        <p>''It's a fairly bizarre thing to have someone run for Congress and put their headquarters outside of the district,'' Mr. Maloney said.</p>
        <p>''The district has 27 cities and towns. There are a lot of offices available throughout the district.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''We had pointed out to his campaign a couple months ago that his office was outside of the district, our concerns about why this was the case.''</p>
        <p>The complaint filed by lawyers for the Congressional campaign committee accuses the Nielsen campaign of paying $500 a month in rent, a figure documented in campaign filings, for office space that it says has a true market value of $2,083 per month.</p>
        <p>The complaint points out that the landlord, Anthony Cocchiola, donated $1,000 to the Nielsen campaign. His wife, Sandra, also donated $1,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cocchiola, who owns a paving company, did not return a call seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nielsen's campaign manager, Fergus Cullen, said that the Maloney campaign was simply trying to divert the attention of voters.</p>
        <p>''This is tit for tat,'' Mr. Cullen said. ''He is just trying to distract attention from the fact that his brother served time for illegal fund-raising on his behalf.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cullen said that until July the campaign had occupied only half the building at 764 Straights Turnpike. Since taking the other half, he said, the rent had doubled to $1,000, a change not yet reflected in campaign filings.</p>
        <p>And he defended its location, saying that Mr. Nielsen had occupied it previously for his private law practice and that it was near Gov. John G. Rowland's 1998 campaign headquarters.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Maloney campaign, which lists the address of its headquarters in downtown Waterbury on its Web site and in campaign fliers, the Nielsen campaign does not publicize the address of its headquarters.</p>
        <p>Instead, it uses a post office box in Danbury, the Fifth District's largest city. ''Our treasurer lives in New Fairfield so it's easier for him to go to the post office box in Danbury,'' Mr. Cullen said.</p>
