        <p>All week the Giants have guarded against the danger of looking past Sunday's game in Chicago to a matchup the following weekend with the Washington Redskins. But for the Giants' defense, which is riding high, the biggest challenge may be taking the Bears (0-2) seriously.</p>
        <p>How do you prepare for a team that was shut out, 41-0, last Sunday, its first blanking in 11 years?</p>
        <p>The Giants' defense may be playing well after two victories in which the Arizona Cardinals and the Philadelphia Eagles were held to 99 total rushing yards, but the defense has still spent the week preparing for a Bears team that did almost everything wrong offensively last Sunday against Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>Cade McNown, the Bears' second-year quarterback, threw two interceptions, fumbled and was sacked five times. The Bears (0-2) produced only 165 yards of offense. McNown leads the team in rushing with 136 yards, which only underscores how bad the Bears' offense has been.</p>
        <p>McNown has two standout receivers in Bobby Engram and Marcus Robinson, but he seemingly has spent more time escaping defenses.</p>
        <p>''I like our chances better with him moving,'' Giants defensive tackle Keith Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>Defensive end Michael Strahan said, ''We have to get to him, and when we get to him, we have to get him on the ground.''</p>
        <p>In McNown, the Giants will be facing a member of the highly touted quarterback class of 1999 for the second week in a row. Like the Eagles' Donovan McNabb, McNown is a scrambling quarterback. The Giants handled Arizona's Jake Plummer and McNabb fairly well, with the defense finally applying pressure to McNabb on Sunday.</p>
        <p>After McNown struggled Sunday, the Chicago news media was already speculating when Jim Miller would replace him. McNown this week bristled at a question during a conference call with reporters that suggested he may have been rushed into starting last year as a rookie.</p>
        <p>The real adjustment for the Giants' defense will come in facing the Bears' spread-out offense, which relies heavily on screens, and Coach Jim Fassel has asked his defensive line to respond quickly to passes.</p>
        <p>The Bears simply have to pass to succeed, and Fassel also warned his team to make open-field tackles. He felt the team was unable to stop the Eagles in the open field.</p>
        <p>The Bears will be hard-pressed to mount a rushing attack. James Allen was a practice squad member and Curtis Enis has not been the same since he tore an anterior cruciate ligament in his rookie season in 1998. Enis is averaging 2.1 yards a carry.</p>
        <p>Barber's Buddy System</p>
        <p>Tiki Barber leads the National Football League in rushing with an astonishing 10-yard average a carry, and he credits his breakout start partly to an off-season training program that teammate Greg Comella suggested.</p>
        <p>Comella, the Giants' fullback, persuaded Barber to join him each week on a two-mile run up a mountain near Ramapo College in northern New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''It was tough duty,'' Barber said, ''but he'd always yell at me: 'Tiki, no one else is doing this. The reason we are going to be successful this year is because no one else is out here. No one else is putting their body through this and mind through this.' ''</p>
        <p>Sack Alert</p>
        <p>Michael Strahan, who saw his sack total drop from 15 in 1998 to five and a half last season, was credited for a half sack in Sunday's victory at Philadelphia, his first this season.</p>
        <p>Linebacker Ryan Phillips was initially credited with one sack before the National Football League gave Strahan credit today, the first sack of any kind for the defensive line this season.</p>
        <p>Quiet Please</p>
        <p>The Giants are on the road again Sunday but the two large speakers that piped crowd noise onto their practice field last week in preparation for the Eagles have been absent this week.</p>
        <p>The speakers are meant to get the offense used to calling plays under loud conditions, but they can have an unintended effect. Fassel said he prescribed throat lozenges for Kerry Collins after the quarterback was screaming over the artificial crowd noise last week.</p>
        <p>''You can wear a quarterback's voice down where in a game he has less volume,'' Fassel said.</p>
