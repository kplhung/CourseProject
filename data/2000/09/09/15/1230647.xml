      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says aviation deal negotiated by Pres Clinton and Chinese Prime Min Zhu Ronghi in April 1999 is so restrictive that it forces Transportation Dept to pick between cargo and passenger carriers in awarding 10 new weekly flights to China; says that with advent of normalized trade relations, issue should be revisited and greater access to China should be demanded for both cargo and passengers</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>As the Senate takes up permanent normal trade relations with China, the Department of Transportation is on the verge of awarding an additional United States carrier the valuable right to fly to that nation. Lamentably, the aviation deal negotiated by President Clinton and Zhu Rongji, China's prime minister, in April 1999 does not reflect the spirit of the trade agreement. It is so restrictive that the Transportation Department, for the first time ever in such a bilateral route-awarding proceeding, is being forced to pick between cargo and passenger carriers. Chinese negotiators refused to differentiate between the two.</p>
        <p>The resulting apples-or-oranges lobbying fight for the 10 new weekly flights has been both intense and bizarre, even by Washington standards. The Teamsters union, while opposing the trade deal with China, has aggressively lobbied members of Congress and the White House on behalf of the bid by United Parcel Service. The company employs some 200,000 Teamsters, and the union is keen on benefiting from the anticipated explosion of trade that it opposed.</p>

        <p>As the Senate takes up permanent normal trade relations with China, the Department of Transportation is on the verge of awarding an additional United States carrier the valuable right to fly to that nation. Lamentably, the aviation deal negotiated by President Clinton and Zhu Rongji, China's prime minister, in April 1999 does not reflect the spirit of the trade agreement. It is so restrictive that the Transportation Department, for the first time ever in such a bilateral route-awarding proceeding, is being forced to pick between cargo and passenger carriers. Chinese negotiators refused to differentiate between the two.</p>
        <p>The resulting apples-or-oranges lobbying fight for the 10 new weekly flights has been both intense and bizarre, even by Washington standards. The Teamsters union, while opposing the trade deal with China, has aggressively lobbied members of Congress and the White House on behalf of the bid by United Parcel Service. The company employs some 200,000 Teamsters, and the union is keen on benefiting from the anticipated explosion of trade that it opposed.</p>
        <p>United Parcel makes a strong case, because at present FedEx is the only all-cargo carrier that flies directly from the United States to China. By contrast, there are six such carriers authorized to operate between the United States and Malaysia.</p>
        <p>Among passenger airlines, Delta's bid to provide daily nonstop service from New York City to Beijing has the most merit. Delta would join United, Northwest and three Chinese airlines in providing service between the two countries, but would be the first to fly nonstop from the Northeast. Such a route is long overdue. New York, the world's financial capital and the American city with the largest Chinese-American community, has 11 weekly direct flights to Singapore, but none to Beijing or Shanghai. At present, travelers to Beijing must change planes in Detroit.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Department has been weighing these strong competing bids for months, and must now decide which company to give direct access to China, a great asset to a carrier with global aspirations. This page has no view on which bid should prevail, and finds the awarding process an unsettling reminder of the benefits of deregulating air travel. The fewer such routes the government awards by decree, the better.</p>
        <p>In this instance, the restrictive bilateral treaty forces the government to choose between a second American cargo carrier and a third airline to China.  That is unfortunate. With the advent of normalized trade relations, the Clinton administration should revisit this issue and clamor for greater access to China for both cargo and passengers.</p>
