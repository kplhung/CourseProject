        <p>Lemon Drop Kid drew only four rivals for tomorrow's $500,000 Woodward when entries were filed yesterday at Belmont Park. But the 4-year-old star is clearly being aimed toward a prize that eluded him last year, the ultimate prize in racing, Horse of the Year.</p>
        <p>The Kid, trained by Scotty Schulhofer and ridden by Edgar Prado, drew the outside post position in the small field, but was expected to find more of a challenge in the quality of the horses on his inside. They start with the 6-year-old Behrens, on the rail with Jerry Bailey in the saddle, who ran second to the Kid in the Brooklyn and third in the Whitney.</p>

        <p>Lemon Drop Kid drew only four rivals for tomorrow's $500,000 Woodward when entries were filed yesterday at Belmont Park. But the 4-year-old star is clearly being aimed toward a prize that eluded him last year, the ultimate prize in racing, Horse of the Year.</p>
        <p>The Kid, trained by Scotty Schulhofer and ridden by Edgar Prado, drew the outside post position in the small field, but was expected to find more of a challenge in the quality of the horses on his inside. They start with the 6-year-old Behrens, on the rail with Jerry Bailey in the saddle, who ran second to the Kid in the Brooklyn and third in the Whitney.</p>
        <p>Then comes a new test, Skimming, Bobby Frankel's winner of the San Diego Handicap and the Pacific Classic, who will start alongside a pair of warriors, Ecton Park and Gander. And rain in the forecast may complicate things for all five.</p>
        <p>''I think he's matured enough that a wet track wouldn't make a difference,'' Schulhofer said, remembering how Lemon Drop Kid had won in the rain at Saratoga last month. ''He handled it at Saratoga, and it was getting pretty wet before the Whitney.''</p>
        <p>But this will be the first time the Kid has been asked to cope with Skimming, a West Coast speedball, whose trainer, Frankel, is known for crossing the continent to win major races in the East.</p>
        <p>Behrens will be looking to rebound from clipping heels and stumbling during a rough trip in the Whitney. His trainer, James Bond, said he was disregarding the mishaps: That was yesterday, and the Woodward is Saturday.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow's card also features the Ruffian Handicap, a Grade One stakes with a purse of $250,000. It drew a field of seven, led by Lu Ravi and Riboletta. The third stakes race of the day, the $200,000 Belmont Breeders' Cup, drew a field of nine, including the 8-year-old gelding Val's Prince.</p>
        <p>UNSHADED SHELVED: The year's casualty list grew longer this week, and more distinguished: Unshaded, winner of the Travers Stakes last month and the newest leader of the 3-year-old class, has been taken out of action until next year because of a strained tendon in his left front leg. Carl Nafzger, who trains Unshaded for James Tafel, said that his colt came out of the Travers with some heat in the tendon. He was flown back to Churchill Downs in Kentucky for surgery. The horse, a son of Unbridled, finished in the money in the Belmont Stakes, the Peter Pan and the Jim Dandy before winning the Travers, and was being aimed at the Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 4.</p>
        <p>The casualty list already had one of the country's best sprinters, Richter Scale, who was retired to stud with a tendon injury after running sixth in the Forego Handicap at Saratoga last month.</p>
        <p>AUCTION RECORDS: The auctioneer's gavel keeps falling on record prices almost every day at the September sale of yearlings at Keeneland in Lexington, Ky. The reasons for the boom are clear in terms of supply and demand.</p>
        <p>The supply was created mainly by Will Farish, the master of Lane's End Farm in Kentucky, who decided to hold his yearlings out of Keeneland's prestigious July sale this year and to shoot the works at the September sale. In the first two days of 13 scheduled for the auction, he sold 46 yearlings for more than $45 million.</p>
        <p>Most of the demand for horses came from abroad, notably from the Middle East and Britain. The Coolmore Stud of England and Ireland paid $6.8 million for a Storm Cat colt consigned by Lane's End Farm, the highest price ever paid at the Keeneland September sale and the highest paid in North America since 1985, when Seattle Dancer brought $13.1 million and Lee Etaab brought $7 million.</p>
        <p>That's not all. Two yearling fillies were sold this week for record prices, too. First, a daughter of Theatrical brought $4 million from Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum of Dubai. Then, that record was broken a short time later when a daughter of Storm Cat brought $4.4 million from his brother, Sheik Hamdan al Maktoum.</p>
        <p>One result of the bull market: Storm Cat, who is 17 years old and the most successful stallion in recent times, will now cost $400,000 (live foal) for one mating. That is an increase of $100,000 from this year's fee, and the numbers speak for themselves.</p>
