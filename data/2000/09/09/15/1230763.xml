        <p>SUNDAY 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>Atlanta (1-1) at Carolina (1-1)  The Falcons looked awful last week against Denver. Slow, ragged and disorganized. The games between these two teams are usually close and high-scoring, which means Atlanta will play better. The difference maker is Carolina quarterback Steve Beuerlein, who is first in the conference with a 116.1 passer rating. Atlanta's defense gets torched for 300 passing yards.  Panthers, 28-24</p>

        <p>SUNDAY 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>Atlanta (1-1) at Carolina (1-1)  The Falcons looked awful last week against Denver. Slow, ragged and disorganized. The games between these two teams are usually close and high-scoring, which means Atlanta will play better. The difference maker is Carolina quarterback Steve Beuerlein, who is first in the conference with a 116.1 passer rating. Atlanta's defense gets torched for 300 passing yards.  Panthers, 28-24</p>
        <p>Cincinnati (0-1) at Jacksonville (1-1)  Quarterback Mark Brunell, for one of the first times in his career, has spent most of this season as a classic dropback passer. Brunell loves to roll out and play loose, so the fact he has stayed in the pocket and is playing well is a good omen for the Jaguars. Not to mention that against Cincinnati Brunell is 3-0 with a passer rating of 113.2.  Jaguars, 25-10</p>
        <p>Philadelphia (1-1) at Green Bay (0-2)  Winning at Lambeau Field is not as difficult as it once was. The Jets did it in the season opener and the Eagles are capable of it. After running back Duce Staley (11 yards) was shut down by the Giants last week, he will rebound against a weak Green Bay defense. The Packers are in trouble.  Eagles, 17-14</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh (0-1) at Cleveland (1-1)  Quarterback Kent Graham injured his throwing hand during practice this week after banging it on a teammate's helmet. He will likely start but there is no question his throwing motion will be affected. The backup, Kordell Stewart, had a touchdown pass and run in last game against Cleveland last season. The Browns showed a spark last week against Cincinnati, but the Steelers have a much better defense than the Bengals.  Steelers, 18-14</p>
        <p>San Francisco (0-2) at St. Louis (2-0)  How good are the Rams? Their defense has allowed 382 yards a game, but they are still undefeated. How bad are the 49ers? They give up 404.5 yards a game. When Rams coaches were looking at game film, they were shocked at just how far San Francisco's defense has fallen. The Rams will score so many points the wide receivers will need track shoes.  Rams, 40-17</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay (2-0) at Detroit (2-0)  This is one of the more intriguing games of the week, mainly because both teams have such outstanding defenses. Tampa Bay is one of the fastest, most well-coached defensive units of the past decade. Surprisingly, the Lions also have a solid unit, allowing just 292.5 yards of offense in the first two games, second best in the conference. The better defense will win this one, and it belongs to Tampa Bay.  Buccaneers, 13-9</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 4:05 P.M.</p>
        <p>Denver (1-1) at Oakland (2-0)  Broncos quarterback Brian Griese is first in the league with a quarterback rating of 120, so Denver has found its replacement for John Elway. The Raiders are a surprising 2-0 because of -- guess who? -- Tyrone Wheatley, the former Giants castoff. Whenever the Raiders venture inside the 20-yard line, Wheatley is a major weapon with his bull rush up the middle or his using sprinter speed to get outside. These games are always close, and Oakland wins in overtime.  Raiders, 24-21</p>
        <p>San Diego (0-2) at Kansas City (0-2)  Coach Gunther Cunningham hasn't talked about quitting the past few days, so other than the Chiefs' poor start, everything is fine in Kansas City. Actually, it's disastrous, because the Chiefs have had two brutal close losses, the last one coming to Tennessee in overtime. Those losses are still eating at the Chiefs and will prove too great a distraction.  Chargers, 20-17</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 4:15 P.M.</p>
        <p>Minnesota (2-0) at New England (0-2)  Rookie quarterback Daunte Culpepper was supposed to be in over his head, but he is the engineer of an offense that averages 421 yards a game. The Patriots have an excellent secondary over all, but few teams can stop Randy Moss and Cris Carter, and Minnesota's defense is playing extremely well.  Vikings, 20-10</p>
        <p>New Orleans (1-1) at Seattle (0-2)  The Saints finally have a decent offense mainly because quarterback Jeff Blake has added the long pass to the arsenal. The Seahawks are in total disarray. General Manager and Coach Mike Holmgren is discovering that doing both jobs is much harder than it appears.  Saints, 35-28</p>
        <p>Giants (2-0) at Chicago (0-2)  The Giants have an offense for the first time since Phil Simms was the quarterback. The defense is playing inspired because for the first time in years players can actually have a break, and not go right back on the field after stopping an opposing offense. Michael Strahan manhandled Philadelphia offensive tackle Jon Runyan last week, linebacker Jessie Armstead is again playing at a Pro Bowl level and cornerback Jason Sehorn is blanketing receivers. This game will be tough because the Bears know if they lose any playoff hopes are all but gone. Still, the Giants win.  Giants, 27-16</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 8:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>Baltimore (2-0) at Miami (1-1)  The Ravens' Tony Banks has to be considered one of the hotter quarterbacks in the game, mainly because he has demonstrated poise and great arm strength. The offense, surprisingly, is carrying this team, when its defense is clearly the better half. The scary part is that when Baltimore's defense does catch its breath, the team will be that much better.  Ravens, 20-6</p>
        <p>MONDAY 9 P.M.</p>
        <p>Dallas (0-2) at Washington (1-1)  Everyone in the Washington organization is waiting for the impatient owner Daniel Snyder to go on one of his firing binges, beginning with Coach Norv Turner. One day Snyder will go off, but not this week. He knows now there is no reason to panic. The Cowboys are not very good. The team is old and quarterback Troy Aikman, because of numerous concussions, is becoming more frail as each season passes. Washington's defense is playing well and will shut down what little offense the Cowboys possess.  Redskins, 28-21</p>
        <p>Game of the Week</p>
        <p>Buffalo 2-0 Jets 2-0  The Jets seek their first 3-0 start since 1966. That's almost 35 years of history working against them. But this team has tremendous courage. The Jets were completely outplayed by New England until the final six minutes last Monday night and still won. If they play that poorly against the Bills, New York will lose. The Jets should play much better than they did against New England and win a close one.  Jets, 21-17</p>
