        <p>Deutsche Post, the postal and logistics company controlled by the German government, is in talks to gain control of DHL International by substantially increasing its 25 percent stake in the company, a courier concern that has operations in the United States, people close to the negotiations said. The deal would value Brussels-based DHL at about 11 billion euros ($9.4 billion), far less than what had been speculated. DHL would give Deutsche Post, which is planning to go public in November, a global delivery network and pit it against the FedEx Corporation of Memphis and United Parcel Service of Atlanta.</p>
