        <p>There are more than 100 municipal pools in this sprawling city where Dawn Fraser and Ian Thorpe learned how to swim astonishingly fast. On any given day in any season, you can find someone doing laps with a sense of purpose.</p>
        <p>Head to Bondi Beach in the winter where members of the Iceberg Club ignore their chattering teeth and plunge in a seaside saltwater pool. Head to an aquatics center in late summer when hordes of teenagers covered in colorful grease paint race in school carnivals that resemble fraternity initiation rites.</p>
        <p>Beginning on Saturday, though, all eyes will be on just one pool in Sydney: the Olympic pool at Homebush Bay. If the pundits are correct, the thousands watching in person and the millions viewing around the world could be treated to the most compelling swim meet in memory.</p>
        <p>''It certainly looks that way,'' said Michael Klim, one of several Australians hoping to win gold medals over the next eight days.</p>
        <p>No nation is more passionate about competitive swimming than Australia, where the majority of people live within a short drive of the ocean. Nearly all Australians learn to swim early and those who excel receive considerable positive reinforcement from a society where the best swimmers are in the spotlight every year, not just every four years.</p>
        <p>''I always say that Australia is like swimming heaven,'' said Jenny Thompson, an American who has trained here extensively in the last year. ''Because I think it's the country that gives the most respect to the sport.''</p>
        <p>The Australians, led by the otherworldly 17-year-old Thorpe and the veteran Susie O'Neill, appear to have their strongest Olympic team since 1956, when the team featuring Fraser and Murray Rose took full advantage of the home-pool advantage to win 8 of the 13 gold medals contested in Melbourne. This time, the Australians are clear favorites in seven events, but the program has expanded greatly in 44 years, which means that there are now 25 events in which they are not clear favorites.</p>
        <p>The Australian men should challenge the American men and the remarkable double-jointed backstroker Lenny Krayzelburg for medal supremacy, but the Australian women are merely one element in a balanced field. Female swimmers from Japan could win three individual gold medals and Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands could win three all by herself in the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle and 100-meter butterfly.</p>
        <p>''I think we're in for one of the most exciting Olympics in history, because it's going to be a world competition; it seems to me about nine or 10 countries have a chance to win Olympic gold,'' said the American women's coach, Richard Quick. Only two of the American women swimmers -- Brooke Bennett in the 800-meter freestyle and Megan Quann in the 100-meter breaststroke -- have the year's fastest time in their events.</p>
        <p>At 27, de Bruijn has already broken world records eight times this year and displaced Thompson as the favorite in the 100 freestyle and 100 butterfly. But her stunning times, remarkable for both their quality and quantity, have been greeted with skepticism by competitors in a sport where systematic doping by East German swimmers in the 1970's and 1980's and by the Chinese in the 1990's contributed to a climate of perpetual suspicion regarding excellence.</p>
        <p>The case of Michelle Smith further poisoned the atmosphere. Smith, an Irish swimmer who like de Bruijn did not peak until her mid-20's, won three gold medals in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. Smith has since been banned from the sport for four years for manipulating a urine sample. Today, Quick reiterated his belief that doping controls were still inadequate because human growth hormone remains undetectable and the new, combined blood and urine test for EPO cannot conclusively detect use beyond a several-day window.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, O'Neill, the veteran Australian swimmer, called de Bruijn's records ''pretty suss,'' slang for suspect, and then sent de Bruijn an apologetic e-mail message. De Bruijn has denied cheating, attributing her huge improvements to several factors: a new training regime under the respected American coach, Paul Sterkel; increased motivation after missing the Atlanta Games; and the lift provided by a new bodysuit.</p>
        <p>The new generation of suits, which along with de Bruijn have been the most pressing and polarizing poolside topic this year, will be worn by the vast majority of competitors in Sydney. Exceptions could be the backstrokers, who are concerned that it increases drag in their event, and Aleksandr Popov, the most successful men's Olympic swimmer of the 1990's. Popov, a Russian who trains with Klim in Australia under Coach Gennadi Touretsky, became the first man to sweep the 50 and 100 freestyle in consecutive Olympic Games when he defended both titles in Atlanta. After losing races and his aura of dominance last year, he has roared back this season to break the world record in the 50 freestyle and threaten his own world record in the 100. He will be the favorite in both events in Sydney and has said that he plans to compete in his own skin here, not a high-tech suit.</p>
        <p>Popov should be pushed very hard in the 50 by the Americans Anthony Ervin and Gary Hall Jr. And in the 100, Popov will face Hall, Klim and Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands, who won six gold medals at last year's European championships.</p>
        <p>''This will be the hardest meet of my life,'' said Popov, who at 28 plans to make it his last Olympic meet.</p>
        <p>Twenty-eight is still considered an advanced age for a swimming star, but age is no longer the same barrier it once was. Dara Torres, 33, became the oldest woman to qualify for the American swim team after an improbable comeback, which came after a seven-year layoff. She will compete with de Bruijn in three individual events.</p>
        <p>At the other end of the age spectrum is 16-year-old Megan Quann, an American who has every intention of ending the world record-holder Penny Heyns's Olympic reign in the 100 breaststroke. This should be one of many duels to remember in the Sydney Aquatic Center, the 17,500-seat arena that will be sold out for every session.</p>
        <p>''You have to understand that in our country we are way down the ladder of popularity,'' said Tom Dolan, an American who is the world record-holder in the 400 individual medley. ''So it's fun to come here and read the papers and see that swimming is not only on the cover of the sports section, but on the cover of the paper. It's helped us to get motivated.''</p>
