        <p>Hazel Clark is a Clark, which means many things, but mostly that she is a runner. Her father ran cross-country in high school, and her half brother and half sister have forged distinguished track careers, particularly in the 800 meters.

        <p>Hazel Clark is a Clark, which means many things, but mostly that she is a runner. Her father ran cross-country in high school, and her half brother and half sister have forged distinguished track careers, particularly in the 800 meters. Her sister-in-law even has an Olympic gold medal for the 4x400 relay and holds the American record in the 800, two laps in 1 minute 56.04 seconds.</p>
        <p>When Hazel Clark was not much more than a toddler, though, she decided two things: that she idolized her older and then-distant half sister, Joetta, and that she would never follow Joetta onto the track. Instead, Hazel spent years at the fence railing, content to watch while Joetta flew past in a blur of legs and accomplishment.</p>
        <p>''When I was really young, I would get really nervous when she'd run,'' Hazel said, ''and I'd root for her and pray to give her all my strength.''</p>
        <p>Now 22, Hazel Clark is one of America's top 800-meter runners. She won the event at the USA Indoor Track and Field Championships in March and at the United States Olympic trials in July. Following right behind her at the trials were Jearl Miles-Clark, her sister-in-law, and Joetta Clark Diggs. Her brother, J. J. Clark, was their coach, and watching from the sideline was the family patriarch, Joe Clark, better known from his ''Lean on Me'' days as a hard-nosed principal in Paterson, N.J.</p>
        <p>The Clark women made headlines and history as the first family to sweep a track and field event in an Olympic trials. When track competition begins Sept. 22 at the Summer Games in Sydney, it will be Hazel's first time on an Olympic team, Jearl's third and Joetta's fourth and final. As far as the 800 goes, the Clarks are America's team.</p>
        <p>''Two sisters coached by a brother who is married to one of their competitors -- it's a story even Hollywood couldn't make up,'' said Craig Masback of USA Track and Field, the organization that oversees more than 4,000 track events a year. ''Jearl has to be the favorite. Hazel has the most untapped potential, and Joetta has more experience than anyone. Each has an opportunity to make it happen.''</p>
        <p>In order to join Team Clark, Hazel first had to find her place among her famous family of runners. She needed to figure out why she was so intimidated, then decide what to do about it.</p>
        <p>When Hazel eventually became a runner, she worried constantly about letting Joetta and the rest of the family down. In the Clark family, failure is not allowed.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Hazel decided to race her sister and sister-in-law for the first time, at the Goodwill Games in New Orleans. Jearl finished first, Joetta second and Hazel fourth.</p>
        <p>''At that point,'' Hazel said, ''I guess I was still caught in that little sister routine, where I was so used to looking up to Joetta and she had been everything to me for so long that I didn't really race her.''</p>
        <p>But something in Hazel had changed by the Olympic trials in Sacramento on July 23. ''This time,'' she said, ''I felt like I was going to race her -- not cut in behind her, not let myself be beaten by my big sister, not make excuses because I was young or not supposed to be at the top. No, I went for it.''</p>
        <p>With that, Hazel Clark left the railing for good.</p>
        <p>Joetta Clark Diggs has watched her sister for years now, with the pride and frustration of a drill sergeant. Hazel, or Peachy, as the family calls her, is Joetta's project as much as her sister.</p>
        <p>Joetta was already 16 and a senior in high school when Hazel was born, and she was not keen about the prospect of baby-sitting. The baby was welcome, Joetta said, but she was closer to J. J., who was only two years younger. Joetta and J. J. had grown up together in Newark. They had adjusted to their parents' divorce and to their father's remarriage. They had discovered the family talent for running track, although their father forbade them from becoming sprinters because he wanted to combat the stereotype that black people could not run distances.</p>
        <p>''Doing that roadwork is very, very lonely,'' Joe said recently, ''but it builds character.''</p>
        <p>In matters of character, Joetta is her father's daughter. She is aggressive and serious, well read and business savvy. Even as a teenager, she thrived on the discipline of all-day workouts, and for a long time she had little time for Hazel. Joetta was running the 800 at age 12 and missing her high school graduation at 17 because she was at her first Olympic trials. She has already been on three Olympic teams; her best finish was seventh in the 800 meters in 1992. The 38-year-old has been ranked in the national top 10 every year for the last 20 years, and in 1998, she was ranked fourth in the world.</p>
        <p>''It takes a lot mentally to come back and train and race year after year, to stay that intense over that many years,'' said Mark Young, the assistant coach overseeing America's 800-meter runners in Sydney. ''She's the consummate professional.''</p>
        <p>She is a veteran in a sport filled with sprightly 20-somethings like Hazel. If Joetta is intense, she said she has had to be to survive in her sport; Hazel never had to fight for the college scholarships or the big-money shoe deals that now give professional sports so much gloss.</p>
        <p>''When I was Hazel's age, I was more focused,'' Joetta said, ''but it was a different generation. Women during my time were trying to establish themselves in the career world, and at 21, I was trying to prove that as a black woman I was educated. Now it's a whole different game.</p>
        <p>''Like as an athlete, she thinks that there were always nice tracks and nice weight rooms and nice equipment, and everyone always had planes to fly on to go to all their meets. She doesn't understand life before Title IX, when women couldn't do the same things as men, didn't have the budget. So she's more into the enjoyment of it, just having fun.''</p>
        <p>It is true: Hazel Clark is having fun on the track these days, relishing the Olympics with the giddiness of a spectator and taking along several suitcases for the trip. Joetta packed one.</p>
        <p>But what about Hazel's childhood promise never to be a runner? She kept it for a time, becoming a dancer, then a figure skater. But by 16, she was 5 feet 9 inches tall -- long-legged for a skater -- and she quit the sport after a serious fall on the ice. Only then did she give in to the pleadings of her siblings, who saw potential in Hazel's long stride.</p>
        <p>She begrudgingly became a runner. She attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, where her brother is an assistant track coach, and she trained with J. J.'s wife, Jearl. Joetta stayed in New Jersey, but regularly flew down to train.</p>
        <p>Jearl, 34, said she has watched Joetta mellow and Hazel mature, but added, ''I didn't know it for a long time, but Hazel still felt she had a lot to live up to. She wanted so much to be her own person.''</p>
        <p>It took nearly six years for Hazel to overcome her feelings of inferiority and finally fall in love with the sport that she felt belonged to her sister. Late last year, the three Clarks started training for the Olympics. During those early-morning workouts and summer track meets, Hazel got to know Joetta, not as a record-setter but as a sister, someone who loves to cook and hates to lose and reminds her so much of their father that it is eerie. And one day after a long workout, it happened.</p>
        <p>''I just stopped and thought, 'You're supposed to be up there. You've worked hard, and Joetta will be proud of you. She won't take anything from you,' '' Hazel said. ''It felt good.''</p>
        <p>She was right. Joetta said: ''She's a good kid. She still has to prove herself a lot, but she's going to have some good years. She's so talented.''</p>
        <p>Since that workout, Hazel said she no longer minds carrying on the Clark legacy. She has chosen to love the sport on her own terms, and now she wants nothing more than to race alongside her sister and sister-in-law one last time in Sydney. After the Olympics, Joetta will retire.</p>
        <p>''This is make-or-break time, and it's my first, but it's her last,'' Hazel said. ''But now we're motivating each other, and I think that's why we all made the team. We get to the finals, and we're going to make some more history.''</p>
