        <p>''Human Resources'' was shown as part of this year's New Directors/ New Films series. Following are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times on April 5. The film, in French with English subtitles, opens today at the Loews State, Broadway at 45th Street, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''Human Resources'' begins innocently enough as the story of an eager beaver fresh out of business school who returns from Paris to his home in the provinces to take a white-collar job at the factory where his father has worked for 30 years. In these opening scenes, Frank (Jalil Lespert), the pride of his blue-collar family, is a veritable Boy Scout: a little overconfident, perhaps, but also a model son and, once he lands a job in the factory's human resources division, a dutiful, enthusiastic employee bursting with new ideas.</p>

        <p>''Human Resources'' was shown as part of this year's New Directors/ New Films series. Following are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times on April 5. The film, in French with English subtitles, opens today at the Loews State, Broadway at 45th Street, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''Human Resources'' begins innocently enough as the story of an eager beaver fresh out of business school who returns from Paris to his home in the provinces to take a white-collar job at the factory where his father has worked for 30 years. In these opening scenes, Frank (Jalil Lespert), the pride of his blue-collar family, is a veritable Boy Scout: a little overconfident, perhaps, but also a model son and, once he lands a job in the factory's human resources division, a dutiful, enthusiastic employee bursting with new ideas.</p>
        <p>But as ''Human Resources'' goes along, it slowly and deliberately spirals its ingenuous hero down a treacherous rabbit hole of duplicity and corporate politics that eventually threatens to put Frank and his father (Jean-Claude Vallod) on opposite sides of a war between management and labor. As it burrows into its subject, this smart, coolheaded and ultimately wrenching film, directed by Laurent Cantet, explores class differences, corporate behavior, labor relations and father-son strife with an unusual depth and subtlety. The story it tells might be described as a naive young man's unsentimental education.</p>
        <p>As schematic as it becomes, ''Human Resources'' never loses its poignant human dimension. It is so beautifully acted that the cast, especially the nonprofessional actors playing the embattled factory workers, seems plucked from the streets of a provincial French town. Mr. Lespert brings just enough eager-beaver unctuousness to his part so that Frank never seems heroic. Although the movie doesn't stridently take sides, its sympathies tilt toward the workers.</p>
        <p>Frank's unhappy lesson in labor relations begins when he suggests to his bosses that the workers be polled on the desirability of a 35-hour workweek. What better way, he imagines, could management demonstrate to the assembly-line workers that they have a voice in how things are done? But the tough, grizzled union representative, Mrs. Amoux (Danielle Melador), immediately smells a rat. Frank is devastated when the results of the survey become a justification for more layoffs. When he discovers that his own father is on the list of those to be dismissed, he is faced with excruciating choices. His wildly impulsive responses only compound the trouble.</p>
        <p>As anguished as ''Human Resources'' becomes, it is wise in the ways of the workplace, and the movie could be read as a cautionary primer for those entering the labor force. Frank is so eager to prove himself that he initially ignores the chain of command and steps on a few toes. He also learns that his relationship with his friends on the assembly line is compromised by his new status, and he finds himself resented and feared.</p>
        <p>Pathetically susceptible to the flattery and manipulation of his boss (Lucien Longueville), he also learns you can't be on both sides of a labor war. But his most painful lessons have to do with being the son of a man who sacrificed to send him through college so that he could become a white-collar manager and, in effect, the enemy.</p>
        <p>The crowning irony of Frank's ''success'' is that it alienates him from the father who made it possible. The movie's dramatic climax is a father-son confrontation of stunning cruelty. Although the movie stops  short of outright tragedy, it is suffused with a grief born of rifts that may never be mended.</p>
