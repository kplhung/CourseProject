        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* MUHAL RICHARD ABRAMS, Society for Ethical Culture Auditorium, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 594-7149. Since the mid-1960's Mr. Abrams has been been a one-man terminus of new sounds that fall between jazz and classical music; as organizer of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, composer, pianist and band leader, he is an important figure in post-World War II music. The concert begins with a solo-piano set, then moves on to a performance by a 13-piece orchestra, including Mr. Abrams as pianist and conductor, the first-rate young tenor saxophonist Aaron Stewart, the trumpeters Ralph Alessi and Eddie Allen, and Reggie Nicholson on drums. Showtime is tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $15, or $8 for students and seniors (Ben Ratliff).</p>

        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* MUHAL RICHARD ABRAMS, Society for Ethical Culture Auditorium, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 594-7149.

Showtime is tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $15, or $8 for students and seniors (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>BATOFAR: NEW FRENCH ELECTRONICA, the Frying Pan, Pier 63, Hudson River at 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-7656. The French have finally found a zone of modern popular music where they don't sound silly abroad: electronica. This is a two-night showcase of house, drum-and-bass and techno disc jockeys and performers. Tonight's lineup includes Luis, Dat Politics, Hector, Miss Kittin and Mr. Neveux, Big Ben, and D.J. Bertrand; tomorrow includes Luis, Erik M, Bum Cello, Irwin Conspiracy, Les Clones and Agoria. Both nights at 9 p.m.; admission is $12 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>* TONY BENNETT AND DIANA KRALL, Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, Manhattan, (212) 632-4000. If anyone deserved to inherit Frank Sinatra's title as Chairman of the Board, it is Mr. Bennett, who is at the peak of his vocal form. But instead of wielding the original's sometimes forbidding executive authority, Mr. Bennett conveys an unalloyed joy in singing. No one is in danger of being fired under this regime. Ms. Krall is the pop-jazz world's brightest hope for a singer to carry on the sultry sophistication of Peggy Lee. Sold out, but returns may be available. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $175.</p>
        <p>(Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>* HAMIET BLUIETT, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South between Bleecker and Grove Streets, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. What a deep, declarative, raucous sound that baritone saxophone can make when Mr. Bluiett is stalking a good time. A longtime member of the World Saxophone Quartet, he gives the full scope of his sense of play only in his own gigs. He turns 60 this week, so you can expect a party. Sets through Sunday are at 9 and 11 p.m., with a 12:30 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $20 plus a $10 minimum tonight and tomorrow; $17.50 with a $10 minimum, Sunday (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>VINICIUS CANTUARIA-ARTO LINDSAY DUO, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8777. Vinicius Cantuaria is steeped in the bossa nova: its gently brushed guitar chords, its quietly elaborate melodies, its shades of sensuality and melancholy. He knows it well enough to stretch the form without losing its essence. Arto Lindsay, whose resume stretches from downtown New York improvisation to producing Brazilian superstars like Caetano Veloso, loves both the breathy delicacy of bossa nova and the noise an untuned guitar can make. They'll be playing duets. Tonight at 8:30; tickets are $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* SHEMEKIA COPELAND, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42d Street, (212) 997-4144. Shemekia Copeland got an early start on the blues circuit touring with her father, Johnny Copeland, who died last year. With a gutsy but girlish voice, like Etta James or Bonnie Raitt, she sings about men and their many flaws, from indifference to infidelity, and she sounds as if she'll get what she wants sooner or later. Tonight at 8 and 10:30, with Debbie Davies opening; admission is $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* OSCAR D'LEON, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2672. Oscar D'Leon, from Venezuela, leads one of the tightest, most exuberant bands in salsa. He sings in a soaring tenor, spins his upright bass and cues riff after kinetic riff from his band's horns, piano and percussion. Tonight he shares a bill with Los Soneros del Barrio, with music beginning at about 10; admission is $10 before 10, $20 after, or $30 for reserved table seating. Tomorrow he shares a bill with Tonny Tun Tun, with music beginning around 11 p.m.; admission is $10 before 11, $25 after, or $35 for reserved seats at tables (Pareles).</p>
        <p>EMBLAM SUPER ELECTRO FIESTA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. It is unclear what the acronym Emblam stands for, but no doubt it's something underground and cutting-edge. Tonic goes electronic for this two-day festival, featuring avant-stars like Ikue Mori, Christian Marclay, Khan and D.J. Olive, plus many other experimenters fiddling with synthesizers and Powerbooks. A two-day pass is available for $20, for those who want to saturate themselves in bleeps, blips and whooshes. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m.; admission each night is $12 in advance, $15 at the door (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>TOMMY FLANAGAN TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. The great mainstream jazz pianist, one of the seedlings sent here from Detroit in the 1950's, has given New York several decades' worth of consummate small-group craftsmanship, balancing improvisation and delicate form in bebop, Ellingtonia, song standards and his originals. Sets through Sunday are at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m.; cover charge is $20 tonight and tomorrow; $15 on Sunday; $10 drink minimum on all days (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>FOETUS, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Jim Thirlwell, also known as Foetus, has been releasing albums for nearly 20 years and likes his music to have an immediate impact: roaring, blasting, pounding and resounding as he snarls dire tidings. Through the years, he has harnessed industrial-strength drum machines and swing rhythms, cacophonous guitars and sickly-sweet strings. This is his first New York performance since 1997. Tonight at 11; tickets are $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* JUAN GABRIEL, ANA GABRIEL, Madison Square Garden, Seventh Avenue at 32d Street, Manhattan, (212) 465-6741. One of Mexico's most flamboyant and crowd-pleasing singers, Mr. Gabriel works with slick pop bands, mariachi groups and brass bands, sometimes all in the same marathon concert. Naturally, he belts love songs, but he also ponders whether Mexican culture can survive in a world of free trade. Ana Gabriel, who is not related to Mr. Gabriel, is a Spanish singer whose songs revel in tragic love. Sunday at 6 p.m.; tickets are $40 to $75 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>CHARLIE HADEN AND GERI ALLEN, Iridium, 48 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. A decade ago, Mr. Haden, the bassist, and Ms. Allen, the pianist were part of a great trio; they know each other's moves and go far beyond the politeness of so many standards-heavy duets between first-class players. Sets through Sunday are at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., with a 12:30 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30 plus a $10 drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* B. B. KING BLUES FESTIVAL, PNC Bank Arts Center, Garden State Parkway, Exit 116, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-0400; Jones Beach, Meadowbrook Parkway South, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000. If you can't stand going to Times Square (and are thus avoiding the reigning blues guitar king's swank basement supper club on 42nd Street), go out to an arena and watch him lead a fine and varied roster through an assortment of modern blues. Get there early for Corey Harris, the outstanding, innovative young Delta-style player, and Susan Tedeschi, that Grammy-winning good young gal. Then enjoy some searing solos with the legendary Texas player Buddy Guy, and end your evening in the presence of the king, Mr. King himself, as he wrings beauty from his beloved guitar, Lucille. Tonight at 6:30 at the PNC Bank Arts Center; tickets are $20 to $49.50. Tomorrow at 6:30 p.m. at Jones Beach; tickets are $18 to $45 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* LEE KONITZ TRIO, KENNY BURRELL QUARTET, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. The big news in this double bill is the group led by Mr. Konitz, the saxophonist, which connects him for a rare stretch of gigs with the pianist Paul Bley and thus aligns two important and influential strains of post-bebop experimentalism. (Steve Swallow, no one to sneeze at, is on bass.) And Mr. Burrell, the guitarist, continues a career begun in the 1940's with his elegant take on bebop and rhythm-and-blues. Sets through Sunday are at 9 and 11:30, and cover charge is $30 plus a $5 drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>LESS THAN JAKE, SUICIDE MACHINES, Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. This double bill offers crazy punk fun with a ska twist. Both Less Than Jake and Suicide Machines are Warped Tour veterans who deliver the manic thrills that skateboarding power-chord aficionados seek. Both also have a loony sense of humor, evident in Less Than Jake's fixation on Pez candy and the Suicide Machine's favorite song subject: Dr. Jack Kevorkian. The bands One Man Army and Pollen also perform. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $14 (Powers).</p>
        <p>TIM McGRAW, FAITH HILL, Madison Square Garden, Seventh Avenue at 32d Street, Manhattan, (212) 465-6741. The twang of country dissolves into the grandiosity of the power ballad in the songs of Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, who not only dominate country-music charts as solo acts but also happen to be a married couple. He gets the good ol' boy songs; she sings about love and kisses. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $32.50 to $65 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* BUDDY AND JULIE MILLER, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, at Mercer Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. Buddy and Julie Miller are a husband-and-wife pair of songwriters from Nashville. Emmylou Harris has recorded Ms. Miller's songs and hired Mr. Miller for her band. The Millers sidestep country's easy wordplay to write folk-rock songs full of rainy, lonely nights; ''You can have my heart,'' Ms. Miller sings, ''if you don't mind broken things.'' Sharing the bill is Solas, an Irish and Irish-American traditional band that plays fiercely virtuosic jigs and reels and tender ballads; Seamus Egan, its flutist, mandolinist and banjoist, wrote ''I Will Remember You,'' which became a hit for Sarah McLachlan. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.; tickets are $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>COATI MUNDI, BAM Cafe, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4139. Long before Ricky Martin, Andy (Coati Mundi) Hernandez brought Latin rhythms to Kid Creole and the Coconuts. He mixes up New York music from swing to funk to ''Spanglish salsa.'' Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; admission is free with a $10 minimum (Pareles).</p>
        <p>TED NUGENT, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-1224. The self-styled Neanderthal of heavy metal plays an intimate showcase tonight. Will he sit down and spin yarns of hunting game and go-go girls, ''Storytellers''-style? Probably not. It's more likely he'll raise heck, playing mind-bendingly rapid guitar solos and his millionth version of ''Stranglehold'' while jumping about in a loincloth. Don't say you haven't been warned. Sunday at 8 p.m.; tickets are $30 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* PACHORA, Knitting Factory, Old Office, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. A quartet made of some of the best downtown improvisers to emerge in the 1990's, Pachora plays Balkan-influenced jazz, wielding foreign instruments and working with 9- and 13-beat rhythms. The exultant musicians manage to outrun the twin terrors of cross-cultural projects, dry musicology and shtick. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 9:30; cover is $8 plus a one drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* SON SEALS, Chicago Blues, 73 Eighth Avenue, below 14th Street, West Village, (212) 924-9755. Son Seals is the quintessential Chicago bluesman, holding on to the ferocity behind the good-time surface of the blues. He roars and growls his pain, and in his solos his guitar wails and jabs with malicious intent. Tonight and tomorrow at 9:30 and 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.; admission is $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* SIVAN PERWER, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. Sivan Perwer is a Kurdish singer who carries an ancient tradition of wandering troubadour songs. He sings about history, legends, love and politics; his Kurdish nationalism has led to his music's being banned at various times in Turkey, Iran and Iraq. He accompanies himself on the banjolike tanbur and will be backed by an ensemble that includes violin, flute, qanun (zither), duduk (reed flute) and percussion. Sunday at 7 p.m.; tickets are $26, or $15 for students (Pareles).</p>
        <p>KURT ROSENWINKEL QUARTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. Rosenwinkel's reputation as a phenomenally talented guitarist who can play anything is high among New York's younger musicians. And the players he's most often seen with are at an equal level on their instruments -- people like Mark Turner and Chris Potter. This week he's with Mr. Turner on tenor saxophone, Ben Street on bass and Eric McPherson on drums. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 8 and 10:30 p.m. and midnight, with a $25 dollar cover for the 8 and 10:30 p.m. sets and an $18 cover for midnight sets. There is a $10 drink minimum for all sets. Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9, with an $18 cover plus a $10 drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* SHANKAR, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. The Indian violinist Shankar has made a career in the West in collaborations with John McLaughlin, Peter Gabriel and Sting; he plays a 10-stringed double-necked electric violin that covers an orchestra's entire range. But he has never left behind Indian classical improvisation, and at this concert, which opens the fall season for the World Music Institute, he will play ragas with two brilliant percussionists urging him on: Zakir Hussain, an incendiary tabla drummer, and T. H. Vikku Vinyakram, who draws a myriad of sounds from a simple clay pot, called a ghatam. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $25 to $45, or $15 for students (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* SILKWORM, Mercury Lounge, 217 Houston Street, at Essex Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Morose yet beautiful indie rock isn't the trend of the moment, but it still exerts a hypnotic pull, and the Seattle-based Silkworm does it as well as any band out there right now. The band's latest album, ''Lifestyle'' (Touch and Go), offers another batch of clangy, engagingly sulky songs for listeners who like to ponder while they rock. Saturnine, a gently rocking New York band, shares the bill. Tomorrow at 10:30 p.m. ; admission is $10 (Powers).</p>
        <p>SUPER DIAMOND, Irving Plaza, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-1224. The folksinger Phranc was brilliantly subversive when she staged a series of Neil Diamond tribute concerts several years ago; this bunch of 30-something Bay Area musicians seems to be simply cashing in. Nostalgia sells, and Super Diamond bottles it with a fizzy dose of irony in dead-on renditions of Mr. Diamond's ''Cracklin' Rosie'' and ''Forever in Blue Jeans.'' The singer, Randy Cordiero, would be working Vegas if shtick like this didn't draw in the clubs these days. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $16.50 in advance, $18 on the day of show (Powers).</p>
        <p>TABOU COMBO, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Since the 1960's, Tabou Combo has been the leading Haitian band playing compas, a gentle but utterly insinuating rhythm that keeps Haitians dancing hip to hip. It toys with funk and rock but always finds its way back to compas. Tonight at midnight and 2 a.m.; admission is $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* HENRY THREADGILL AND ZOOID, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Mr. Threadgill changes bands every five years or so; since the 1980's, his music -- full of dreamy refractions of tango and Indian and Eastern European music -- has gotten progressively longer, darker, more meditative and further away from Americana, or what you might call jazz. This is the world premiere of his newest band, which includes the guitarist Liberty Ellman; on harmonium, Tony Cedras (a holdover from Make a Move, Mr. Threadgill's last ensemble); Tariq Benbrahim on oud; Jose Davilla on tuba; and Dafnis Pietro on drums. Sets are tonight at 9; tomorrow at 9 and 11 p.m.; and Sunday at 8 and 10 p.m.; admission is $14 in advance; $16 day of show (Ratliff).</p>
