        <p>NEW YORKERS who like old cars -- aside from those on the C train -- have several opportunities this month to see vintage models up close.</p>
        <p>This Sunday, the Antique Automobile Association of Brooklyn will have its annual car show from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Floyd Bennett Field. More than 350 cars are expected. ''We display the cars that New York kids grew up with,'' said the club's president, Lenny Shiller, who owns 65 cars himself. ''Like the '59 Cadillacs that you impaled yourself on the tailfins of when you were playing stickball.'' Admission is free.</p>

        <p>NEW YORKERS who like old cars -- aside from those on the C train -- have several opportunities this month to see vintage models up close.</p>
        <p>This Sunday, the Antique Automobile Association of Brooklyn will have its annual car show from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Floyd Bennett Field. More than 350 cars are expected. ''We display the cars that New York kids grew up with,'' said the club's president, Lenny Shiller, who owns 65 cars himself. ''Like the '59 Cadillacs that you impaled yourself on the tailfins of when you were playing stickball.'' Admission is free.</p>
        <p>Next weekend, with the fifth annual Louis Vuitton Classic, the focus will shift to the Channel Gardens at Rockefeller Center and into the realm of exotic models worth millions of dollars. The eclectic group of 50 rare automobiles on display will include a 1925 Rolls-Royce Phantom I Torpedo, complete with a gun rack and ammunition holder, built for an Indian maharajah to use when hunting tigers. A 1932 Ford Highboy hot rod, built in 1937 by Doane Spencer, was a best-in-class winner at the 1997 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. The cars will be displayed Sept. 22-24, with judging on the final day. Admission is free.</p>
        <p>Coinciding with the Vuitton Classic will be an auction of 50 classic and sports cars at 4 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 23, at the Auto Salon Auction at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Among the cars being offered is a custom, one-of-a-kind sports car created for the basketball superstar Wilt Chamberlain. It was built with chassis components from racing cars, including a 467-horsepower V-8.</p>
        <p>David Gooding, president of RM Auctions, said the chassis was stretched six inches, presumably to accommodate Mr. Chamberlain's legs. The company said the car, which cost more than $750,000 to build, was expected to sell for $125,000 to $150,000.</p>
        <p>The auction cars may be viewed from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sept. 23. Admission is $50 for two and includes a catalog. Information is available at (800) 211-4371.</p>
