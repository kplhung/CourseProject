        <p>New York City Transit officials said yesterday that they were considering replacing the yardstick they have used for the last several years to measure the reliability of subway and bus service.</p>
        <p>The proposed new measurement system, the officials argued, would be more understandable and would provide the riding public and transportation planners with more accurate information about whether trains are running smoothly.</p>
        <p>But critics of the change, including the riders' representative on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, say that the new measure is nothing more than a way for the agency to make its service appear better without improving it.</p>
        <p>Under the system now in use, trains and buses are held to a schedule, with more frequent service on busier lines and less on other lines. In its most basic form, the measurement system uses the scheduled intervals between buses or trains. During the day, if a train or bus arrives within 50 percent of this time interval, it is considered on time. So if a train is scheduled to arrive every four minutes, trains that arrive two to six minutes after the previous train are on time.</p>
        <p>But the proposed system, called wait assessment, would apply a three-minute rule to every line. This would mean that a train scheduled to arrive every four minutes would be considered on time if it arrived seven minutes after the previous train.</p>
        <p>Critics of the system point out that for the busiest subway lines -- with very close intervals, under three minutes between trains -- the new system would mean that trains would be marked on time even if the wait had been twice as long as the scheduled interval.</p>
        <p>In addition, the new system would not count trains that arrived early as off schedule, as the current system does. Critics say it is important to count early trains because when a train arrives immediately after the train in front of it, it picks up very few passengers, meaning that the train behind it will be more crowded.</p>
        <p>''What they're doing is just changing the measure, and they're not changing what is happening on the streets and in the subway,'' said Beverly Dolinsky, the executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A. and a nonvoting representative for riders on the authority's board.</p>
        <p>But Al O'Leary, the chief spokesman for New York City Transit, said the present service measure, which was adopted in 1995 after pressure from riders' advocates and the authority's inspector general, was always considered ''so confusing as to be completely meaningless'' by subway and bus planners.</p>
        <p>In a chart provided yesterday by New York City Transit, officials demonstrated differences in the numbers using the two systems. Applying the current yardstick, 80.7 percent of subway trains in the second quarter of this year were counted as arriving on schedule. Under the proposed measure, the percentage would rise to 89.5 percent.</p>
        <p>On some lines, the difference in the results would be striking. On the No. 6 subway line, for example, the grade would rise to 92.1 percent of trains being on time from 69.5 percent. The grade for the M101 bus line, one of the busiest in the city, would rise to 68.7 percent of buses being on time from 33.8 percent.</p>
        <p>Early next month, a meeting will be held with transit riders' advocates and members of the Transit Committee of the authority's board to explain the new system. Mr. O'Leary said that concessions might be made to critics of the change, but that New York City Transit did not need approval from anyone to put the new system into effect.</p>
        <p>''We would rather have concurrence in doing it than not,'' he said.</p>
