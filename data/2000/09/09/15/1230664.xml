        <p>The Treasury Department is investigating whether an American oil company, Conoco, violated sanctions in dealing with Iran, Clinton administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>Conoco helped analyze information collected last year by the National Iranian Oil Company in its exploration of the Azadegan field on the understanding that Conoco would be given priority in developing the field if it became legal to do so, officials said.</p>
        <p>The chief executive of the company, Archie Dunham, has met Iranian officials on visits to Iran.</p>
        <p>Administration officials declined to discuss the nature and scope of the investigation, which The Financial Times reported today. Conoco has acknowledged its interest in doing business in Iran but denied that it had violated American law by advising the Iranian company about its geological discovery.</p>
        <p>''Conoco is mindful of restrictions under U.S. sanctions law and has at all times fully complied with the law,'' a spokesman for Conoco, Carlton Adams, said in a statement. ''Conoco would be delighted to one day help N.I.O.C. develop this giant field and believes it would be in the best interest of the United States for American companies to be involved. This is why the company has been outspoken in its opposition to unilateral sanctions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams confirmed that a British subsidiary of Conoco had worked with Iran on analyzing the Azadegan field, which is estimated to hold oil reserves of 20 billion to 25 billion barrels. Mr. Adams also said Iran had offered to share the information with Conoco because ''they considered us to be a potential participant in the development of the field if U.S. sanctions were lifted.''</p>
        <p>In 1995, the Clinton administration responded to an announcement that Iran had given Conoco a contract to develop an offshore gas field in the Persian Gulf by barring the company from proceeding. Shortly after that, Mr. Clinton announced an executive order that imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran and prohibited American companies from doing business there.</p>
        <p>But in recent months, the administration has eased some minor sanctions, allowing, for example, the American purchase of food and carpets and Iranian purchase of food and medical supplies. Neither Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, nor Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, has expressed any intention of lifting economic sanctions against Iran.</p>
        <p>When Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, was chief executive of Halliburton, the oil services company in Texas, he endorsed lifting sanctions against Iran to let American oil companies conduct business there.</p>
        <p>But after Mr. Bush had chosen him as his running mate, Mr. Cheney told ABC News that he now agreed with Mr. Bush's statement that he would leave sanctions in place. ''If I sign on as his No. 2, so to speak,'' he said, ''I would expect to make my views known, to express my thoughts to him privately.''</p>
