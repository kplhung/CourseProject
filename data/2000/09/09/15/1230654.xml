        <p>In this perfect (2-0) Jets world, Richie Anderson tries to be all things: a wide receiver, a fullback, a tight end, a tailback. He has to be in order to make a living.

        <p>''That's more of a reminiscence now,'' Anderson said today, finding a little time to gobble a chicken salad between going to various meetings, getting taped and rehearsing for Sunday's first-place showdown with the Buffalo Bills at the Meadowlands.</p>

        <p>In this perfect (2-0) Jets world, Richie Anderson tries to be all things: a wide receiver, a fullback, a tight end, a tailback. He has to be in order to make a living. Once, though, he was a Saturday hero as a Penn State running back, the second-leading collegiate scorer in the nation.</p>
        <p>''That's more of a reminiscence now,'' Anderson said today, finding a little time to gobble a chicken salad between going to various meetings, getting taped and rehearsing for Sunday's first-place showdown with the Buffalo Bills at the Meadowlands.</p>
        <p>Since joining the team in 1993, Anderson has had few Jets moments as rewarding as Monday night's stirring fourth-quarter comeback against the New England Patriots. The eight times he touched the ball in the game the Jets got a first down, including four catches for 62 yards on a touchdown drive that put the Jets in position to win.</p>
        <p>Thus, Anderson is tied with the starting receivers Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward for the team lead in receptions with nine. With 129 yards, Anderson has actually accumulated 11 more receiving yards than Chrebet.</p>
        <p>And now on Sunday, the Jets face what Coach Al Groh fears could be the finest defensive team in the league. The Bills were first in the league last season, and so far third this year. That could mean continued rushing problems for Curtis Martin, who remains hobbled with a sprained left knee.</p>
        <p>Martin carried only 11 times against the Patriots. Now he faces a Bills team that has stymied him since 1996, the year after his rookie season with the Patriots. In his last eight appearances against the Bills, he has not generated a 100-yard game. In four games against them as a Jet, he has not amassed more than 64 yards.</p>
        <p>''All the teams that play them have trouble rushing,'' Martin said. ''Eddie George got 37 yards against them.'' George is the Titans' Pro Bowl rusher.</p>
        <p>But even a less-than-perfect Martin could be offset by the new way the Jets are employing Anderson in the offense under Dan Henning's direction. Anderson has seen action as one of five wide receivers at times, and he can be used at most offensive positions with his durable 6-foot-2-inch, 230-pound frame.</p>
        <p>''I told Richie back in the spring there could be a lot more options for him,'' Groh said. ''I told him he's a very versatile player. Maybe there weren't enough balls for him in the past.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, there was a year in which Anderson had zero carries and another in which he had only one. There were three different seasons when he did not have more than three receptions. Even last season, as the starter in what the Jets call the F-back position (a tight end-H-back hybrid), he touched the ball fewer than three times a game.</p>
        <p>''I had some personal goals before the season,'' Anderson said, ''but I'd rather keep them to myself. I've got team goals, and that's what I've been playing for eight years.''</p>
        <p>But does he not think back to the Penn State days, from 1989 to 1993, when he became the Nittany Lions' fourth-leading career rusher?</p>
        <p>''Not so much any more,'' he said. ''I'm a different player now. I'm comfortable with who I am.''</p>
        <p>Groh said: ''Richie has always been a versatile player. But what he's versatile at, he's gotten better.''</p>
        <p>So while Martin tries to recuperate on the job from a knee injury, while quarterback Vinny Testaverde searches for his touch for all four quarters, the Jets have found a safety valve in Anderson.</p>
        <p>''I certainly hope we continue to use him that way,'' Testaverde said. ''It keeps the other team off balance. If they double-team us, someone else will get the ball.''</p>
        <p>For this young season, that has been Anderson, who is trying after all these years to create Jets' memories as significant as the ones he created in college.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>AL GROH has already accomplished a rarity: leading a team to a 2-0 start after replacing a record-setting coach. When BILL PARCELLS stepped down, only 11 National Football League coaches had retired before him with more victories. But only two of their successors managed a 2-0 start: BILL COWHER of the Steelers after CHUCK NOLL in 1992, and JIMMY JOHNSON of Miami following DON SHULA in 1996. . . . Watch for KEVIN WILLIAMS to be the lead kickoff returner as the Jets try to upgrade the special teams against the Bills. Williams is sixth in the American Conference at 24.3 yards. . . . The last time the Jets started 3-0, VINNY TESTAVERDE was not aware of it; he was 2 years old. That was 1966, with JOE NAMATH at the helm in his sophomore year, and the team wound up 6-6-2.</p>
