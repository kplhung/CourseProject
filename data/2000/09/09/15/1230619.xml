        <p>THE TALMUD  AND THE INTERNET  A Journey Between Worlds  By Jonathan Rosen  133 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $16.</p>
        <p>A page or two of the Talmud will offer rabbinical interpretations of the Torah, along with arguments, allegories and legends, all compiled 1,800 years ago in the Mishnah. These are interleaved with others from a few centuries later (the Gemarah), while up one side run the commentaries of the 11th-century scholar, Rashi, and up the other, commentaries by Rashi's own commentators (tosefists).</p>
        <p>Not so much a book as ''a sort of drift net for catching God,'' writes Jonathan Rosen. It is an enticing image for this great religious work whose affirmation comes by means of perpetual interrogation of Self, and of God, the close and cantankerous neighbor. It is an image with a purpose as well, as is Mr. Rosen's note that one rabbinical term for the Talmud means sea, and that the Hebrew word for its chapters means, literally, webbing. We see it coming: net-Internet, sea-surfing, webbing-World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>''I have often thought, contemplating a page of Talmud, that it bears a certain uncanny resemblance to a home page on the Internet, where nothing is whole in itself but where icons and text boxes are doorways through which visitors pass into an infinity of cross-referenced texts and conversations.''</p>
        <p>''The Talmud and the Internet.'' The title is piercing and jaunty, something like a bugle playing reveille at camp, with no close relation to the sounds of the coming day, but both jolting us and enticing us awake to engage with them.</p>
        <p>Can Mr. Rosen really bring together two such radically different things? Not quite. As with the examples above, there is a certain playful sleight of hand. He joins metaphors for his twin subjects more easily than he does the subjects themselves; but we have a digressive good time watching him try. We are moved and enlightened as well.</p>
        <p>The author is writing a kind of spiritual memoir, and he does it wittily, suggestively and with a fine rambling grace. His book has more to say, and more convincingly, about the contemporary significance of the Talmud than of the Internet. He can, indeed, use the former to cast a partial light on the latter; not vice versa, though.</p>
        <p>One of his book's principal themes is that of the transformation of the Jews when they were forced into the Diaspora. ''Jews died as a people of the body, of the land, of the Temple service of fire and blood, and, in one of the greatest acts of translation in human history, they were reborn as the people of the book.'' In Christianity, the word became flesh, he writes. ''In Judaism, I'm faced with the equally challenging notion that the flesh became words.''</p>
        <p>Throughout, Mr. Rosen returns to suggest in different ways that the dispossession and loss that the Jews experienced, and transformed into the Talmud's triumph, resemble the bewildering changes that technology has brought us today. We, too, are dispossessed in some sense from our material certainties, our structures, our books. The Internet operates a dematerializing transformation as the Talmud did 2,000 years ago. It, too, is a vast network of information, arguing voices (those disputatious rabbis), confusion, contradiction and mutually entangled certitudes.</p>
        <p>It is an interesting thought. The flaw is that Mr. Rosen forces comparisons. To say that the mouth is used to eat and to sing is not to say that eating is the same as singing. Mr. Rosen's finding of disorienting change, both now and back then, does not mean that the response is the same, though he does turn up some parallel details. He is careful to make disclaimers. (Behind the Talmud, he writes, is a moral gravity; nobody uses it to make airline reservations or find a date.) Taken together, though, the disclaimers threaten to undermine the thesis.</p>
        <p>What the author has to say about the Internet, in fact, seems more a provocative idea than a conviction. His own feelings, perhaps to his credit, raise some doubts.</p>
        <p>At one point he tells of seeing a computer re-creation on the Web of three destroyed synagogues in Frankfurt. The images ''were three-dimensional but had a flat, inert quality, and the colors, dead blues and lipstick reds and cyber greens, were unnatural, artificial hues,'' he writes. ''The images were like a dream a computer might have of being a person.'' They left him, he concludes, ''feeling empty, miserably detached from the past I hoped to encounter.''</p>
        <p>Later, though, he seems to ignore his own insight. He speaks of being able to visit the synagogues as if such visits were real, as if virtual travel were the equivalent of travel or the movement of a mouse could give the human and divine value to the Internet that the millions of bloody footsteps of the Jews gave to the Talmud. ''Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish,'' Shakespeare wrote, never suggesting that a cloud was a dragon.</p>
        <p>This doth protest too much. In fact Mr. Rosen writes not one or two ideas but a whole sparkling shower of them; and contesting a few is as exhilarating as agreeing with most. Beneath the ideas, though, and what gives this book what I venture to call its soul, is his interrogation of himself as American and Jew. One of his grandmothers died in the Holocaust, the other in a New York hospital longing woozily for a pastrami sandwich.</p>
        <p>Others have raised the felt contradictions between the tragic and luminous Jewish heritage and the ahistorical comforts and complacencies of American life. Few have managed to do it with such a mix of the searching, the modest and -- if the word is not patronizing -- with such charm. Mr. Rosen is an intellectual who writes of contradiction and uncertainty as though they were were beams of light, and as he meditates on his family and his own journeys, he makes them seem so.</p>
