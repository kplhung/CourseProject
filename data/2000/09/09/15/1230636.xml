&lt;br&gt;EUROPE
&lt;br&gt;RUSSIA: ECONOMY BRIGHTENS -- A healthier economy, lucrative oil exports and more effective tax collection increased government revenues for the first half of 2000 to their highest level since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov said. The government said it took in $18.3 billion, nearly two-thirds of its anticipated revenue for the entire year, and predicted a further increase in the second half.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;GERMANY: RIGHTISTS BANNED -- The government banned the far-right group Blood and Honor for spreading neo-Nazi propaganda and breaching the Constitution. Its so-called White Youth wing was also outlawed. ''Germany is the first nation to fight this organization this way,'' Interior Minister Otto Schily said. The group, which was founded in Britain and spread to Germany in 1994, has ties to the larger far-right German National Democratic Party.    Victor Homola (NYT)</byline>

        <p>ITALY: CARDINAL CALLED RACIST -- A leading cardinal has set off a political furor by suggesting that Italy favor Roman Catholic immigrants over Muslims to ''preserve the identity of the nation.'' Many center-left government ministers condemned Cardinal Giacomo Biffi's pastoral letter to his Bologna archdiocese as dangerous and racist. But some center-right politicians agreed with his proposal and the opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi said the cardinal's ideas ''were deemed worthy of attention.''</p>

        <p>MACEDONIA: NATO SUED OVER BEES -- Honey producers have demanded compensation from NATO, saying its bombing campaign against Yugoslavia subjected their bees to ''a terrible stress'' that reduced production to 70 percent less than usual. Mendi Trajkovski, secretary of the Nectar Association of 103 producers, said a claim for $222,300 in damages had been filed with a special NATO commission.</p>

        <p>CANADA: TORY CHIEF QUITS -- In the latest blow to Canada's shrinking Tory party, the party president resigned, only two days after two Tory members of Parliament defected to the Liberals. Peter Van Loan, a Toronto lawyer was an effective fund-raiser, and his loss will hurt the heavily indebted party.</p>
        <p>James Brooke (NYT)</p>
        <p>MEXICO: CHARGED IN MURDERS -- The accused leader of one of Mexico's most powerful drug cartels was charged in a United States federal indictment in El Paso, Tex., with 10 counts of murder, including the killings of seven people whose bodies were found last fall on ranches near Juarez. Justice Department officials believe Vicente Carillo Fuentes, who is a fugitive, ordered the murders to silence those who might have given information to law enforcement agents.</p>

        <p>EL SALVADOR: DENGUE FEVER ALERT Public health authorities appealed for international aid after President Francisco Flores declared a national emergency over an outbreak of dengue fever. Since January, 24 people, mostly children, have died and nearly 2,100 cases of dengue have been reported. The United States Agency for International Development has already provided $25,000 for medical supplies. But Jose Lopez Beltran, the minister of public health , said more aid may be needed since the outbreak has not yet peaked.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>SRI LANKA: EMERGENCY EXTENDED -- Parliament, reconvened for a special session, approved the renewal of a nationwide state of emergency that gives wide powers to security forces battling separatist minority rebels. Parliamentary officials said the measure was approved by a majority of 96 votes after most opposition lawmakers staged a routine walkout.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: MISSILE SYSTEM TESTED -- Israel's Arrow II antiballistic missile system was successfully tested, intercepting a simulated missile similar to the Scuds fired at Israel in the gulf war in 1991, the Defense Ministry said. It was the seventh of eight tests that proved successful for the system, which is heavily financed by the United States.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: POLICE RAID OPPOSITION -- The opposition Movement for Democratic Change said four party officials were detained after its offices were raided by police officers who said they were conducting an investigation into a grenade blast this week outside the party's headquarters. No one was hurt in the explosion, and the officers and intelligence agents arrived at the offices with warrants allowing them to search for firearms and explosives. They apparently found none.</p>

        <p>SUDAN: 4,435 SLAVES BOUGHT -- A Swiss aid group said it bought the freedom of 4,435 slaves in southern Sudan this month, bringing the total freed to 38,000. Christian Solidarity International has been criticized by the United Nations and rights groups, who say buying slaves encourages captors to seize more people. The group said it paid $33 for each slave.</p>
