        <p>Urban Outfitters, a clothing and accessories retailer that caters to young men and women, opened a three-level store this week at the corner of 72nd Street and Broadway.</p>
        <p>The opening comes when the company, like many apparel retailers, has had declining sales. Sales at stores open a year or more, the yardstick used in the retail industry, were down 14 percent in the quarter that ended July 31.

        <p>Urban Outfitters, a clothing and accessories retailer that caters to young men and women, opened a three-level store this week at the corner of 72nd Street and Broadway.</p>
        <p>The opening comes when the company, like many apparel retailers, has had declining sales. Sales at stores open a year or more, the yardstick used in the retail industry, were down 14 percent in the quarter that ended July 31. The company's stock has lost 66.5 percent of its value in the last year.</p>
        <p>Richard A. Hayne, the president and chief executive, attributed the company's poor performance in part to fashion trends that emphasized a more form-fitting look. ''The fashion turned dramatically,'' he said. ''It went from a downtown look to an uptown look. That's not what we're known for or what we do well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hayne said that the company had been forced to offer a style of fashion that ''wasn't really forgiving for a lot of people,'' but has now reverted to its more traditional look.</p>
        <p>''We're definitely back into things we feel comfortable with,'' he said. The company, based in Philadelphia, has 39 stores.</p>
