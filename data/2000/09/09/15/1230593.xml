        <p>One way of looking at Jon Shear's harrowing and indelible film ''Urbania'' is to think of it as ''Sex and the City'' turned inside out.

        <p>One way of looking at Jon Shear's harrowing and indelible film ''Urbania'' is to think of it as ''Sex and the City'' turned inside out. This menacing erotic fantasy, set in Manhattan on the evening of the switch from daylight saving to standard time, adding an extra hour to the night, suggests a surreal cinematic answer to one of Lou Reed's rock 'n' roll walks on the wild side.</p>
        <p>Most of its characters, instead of looking for love, are hunting for sex on the streets and in the bars of a neighborhood that resembles the downscale environs of Chelsea and the West Village near the Hudson River. One of the kicks of cruising the streets after midnight, the movie reminds us, is the thrill of the unknown and its undertone of danger, which ''Urbania'' portrays as palpably, frighteningly real.</p>
        <p>The central character, Charlie (Dan Futterman), is an angry, grief-stricken gay man whose lover, Chris (Matt Keeslar), seen in flashbacks, has mysteriously disappeared and is probably dead. Charlie is obsessed with Chris to the point that he repeatedly dials his number and leaves messages that he knows his absent friend will never get.</p>
        <p>The story darkens as it develops, and it becomes increasingly clear that the normally unprepossessing Charlie is ritualistically psyching himself up to commit an act of violence. One preparatory rite is to ponder scary urban legends, which the movie brings to life with a haunting mixture of realism and horror. There's the one about a man who picks up a woman, is drugged and wakes up in a bathtub covered with blood to discover that one of his kidneys has been removed. And there's the one about a man who has unprotected sex with a woman; the next morning he finds her gone and the message ''Welcome to the world of AIDS'' scrawled in lipstick on the wall.</p>
        <p>Burrowing deeply into the threatening mood of these and other horror stories, Charlie begins playing sadistic mind games with people he meets in a neighborhood bar. He charms, then humiliates an arrogant jock and his bimbo girlfriend. And in his nastiest prank, he picks up a vain bisexual soap-opera actor, goes home with him and pretends to be a violent sociopath. The movie's portraits of these narcissists have a scalding accuracy that even a show as observant and up to date as ''Sex and the City'' rarely equals.</p>
        <p>But Charlie's adventures in mental cruelty are only rehearsals for the creation and acting out of his own urban myth before the night is over. And by the time he attaches himself to Dean (Samuel Ball), a homophobic punk who has been prowling the neighborhood, Charlie's vengeful agenda is painfully apparent.</p>
        <p>If the intense, edgy performances and urban ambience lend each vignette a gripping fascination, ''Urbania'' sometimes pushes too hard. It is also infuriatingly coy in its withholding of crucial information. Once the facts have finally been revealed, ''Urbania'' turns briefly and uncomfortably mawkish with a scene set either in heaven or in one of its anterooms, in which Charlie and Chris have a sad, mystical conversation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Futterman, familiar from the television series ''Judging Amy,'' delivers a remarkably subtle and shaded portrait of a peaceful man driven by overwhelming personal grief and rage to exorcise his personal demons through a kind of violence that doesn't come to him as naturally as it does to the macho men he confronts. The extent to which he forces himself to ignore his more humane impulses makes his situation all the more excruciating. It's the psychic equivalent of being a vegetarian whose survival depends on cannibalism.</p>
        <p>''Urbania'' is as technically innovative as it is emotionally unsettling. Shot in super 16-millimeter film and digitally blown up to 35-millimeter, it has a remarkably rich (and dark) visual palette that matches its moody turbulence.</p>
        <p>''Urbania'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes graphic sex and gory violence.</p>
        <p>URBANIA  Directed by Jon Shear; written by Mr. Shear and Daniel Reitz; director of photography, Shane Kelly; edited by Randolph K.
