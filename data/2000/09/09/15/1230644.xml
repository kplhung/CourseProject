      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Go.com is starting up again after a nine-month pit stop.</p>
        <p>Go, which was the Walt Disney Company's attempt to build an Internet portal to take on the likes of Yahoo, will test a new design beginning today.</p>
        <p>For users, it is a much leaner model, focused almost entirely on searching, rather than the complex, all-purpose vehicle of Go's previous design. As a business, think Nascar, not Formula One, as the site is covered with more and bigger ads than any of its rivals.</p>
        <p>Go.com -- and the broader concept of the Go Network linking all of Disney's online efforts -- was started with great fanfare in December 1998. Disney owned ESPN.com, the top-rated sports side; Disney.com, the No. 1 site for children; ABCNews.com, the No. 3 news site; and a controlling interest in Infoseek, a popular search engine and portal.</p>
        <p>Disney assumed that all of its content, combined with promotion on the ABC television network and other properties, would give Go a lift that Yahoo and the others did not have.  Although Go vaulted to No. 6 in the ratings, it has lost audience share as Yahoo, America Online and Microsoft's MSN have grown briskly.</p>
        <p>Disney is hardly alone in finding  the portal business difficult. Next month, NBC's internet affiliate is expected to introduce its newly redesigned portal, NBCi.com, with a focus on filtering information from the Internet for each user's needs.</p>
        <p>For Disney, one of the biggest changes is that its various sites are not trying as hard to promote their corporate cousins. No longer will every page of every service have links to Disney.com, ESPN.com, and so on. Nor will promotions on television for, say ABC.com, refer to it as part of the Go Network.</p>
        <p>''The Go Network is not something that resonated with consumers,'' said Steve Bornstein, the longtime president of the ESPN cable network, whom Disney assigned last year to run its Internet group. That approach, moreover, had made Go's competitors, like Yahoo and America Online, reluctant to provide links to Disney's sports, news and kids' sites.</p>
        <p>Instead, there has been a focus on creating new formats for advertising that are more effective than the rectangular ad banners that dominate most Web sites. Banner prices have fallen sharply as advertisers have come to question their effectiveness.</p>
        <p>Disney has created a rectangular unit, much the same shape as a television screen, that has 30 percent greater area than a banner and will be placed at the top of Go.com and its other services.</p>
        <p>The Go.com service itself has been streamlined to eliminate vast sections of the site including ''channels'' about a wide range of topics and to de-emphasize other features like chat rooms. Instead, the site will focus on delivering answers for queries typed into the Web search box.</p>
        <p>Moreover, in addition to a banner advertisement, there are three new, larger advertisements with technology that allows for greater interactivity related to the user's search. On a search for ski resorts, for example, L. L. Bean might offer links to its three hottest-selling sweaters.</p>
        <p>Disney hopes advertisers will pay $65 to $85 per thousand impressions for these units, compared with $10 a thousand for its current banners. And of course it hopes for additional revenue gains because there will be more advertisements on every page.</p>
        <p>But competitors say this strategy may not be all it is cracked up to be.</p>
        <p>''You may sell six ads, but that doesn't mean that people click on any more of them,'' said George Bell, chief executive of Excite@Home. He said his company's Excite portal tried pages with more advertising, but all it did was reduce the average number of responses each advertiser received. ''We sold more units, but the advertisers were displeased,'' he said.</p>
