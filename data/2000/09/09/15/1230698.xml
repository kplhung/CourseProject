        <p>In a stinging and highly unusual rebuke of his Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, President Clinton said today that he was ''quite troubled'' by the government's actions in the Wen Ho Lee case.</p>
        <p>His comments came a day after a federal judge in New Mexico harshly criticized the Justice Department for its tactics in the case, and as Attorney General Janet Reno rejected calls for her to apologize to Mr. Lee, a former Los Alamos scientist. He was freed on Wednesday after pleading guilty to a single count of what had been a 59-count felony indictment that accused him of illegally putting at risk vital atomic secrets.</p>

        <p>In a stinging and highly unusual rebuke of his Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, President Clinton said today that he was ''quite troubled'' by the government's actions in the Wen Ho Lee case.</p>
        <p>His comments came a day after a federal judge in New Mexico harshly criticized the Justice Department for its tactics in the case, and as Attorney General Janet Reno rejected calls for her to apologize to Mr. Lee, a former Los Alamos scientist. He was freed on Wednesday after pleading guilty to a single count of what had been a 59-count felony indictment that accused him of illegally putting at risk vital atomic secrets.</p>
        <p>In comments to reporters, Mr. Clinton said he had long questioned whether prosecutors had adequate grounds to keep Dr. Lee in jail for nine months awaiting trial.</p>
        <p>''I always had reservations about the claims that were being made denying him bail,'' Mr. Clinton said.  ''So the whole thing was quite troubling to me and I think it's very difficult to reconcile the two positions that one day he's a terrible risk to the national security and the next day they're making a plea agreement for an offense far more modest than what had been alleged.''</p>
        <p>''I don't think you can justify in retrospect keeping a person in jail without bail when you're prepared to make that kind of agreement,'' he said, speaking with reporters outside the White House after a speech. ''It just can't be justified, and so I, too, am quite troubled by it.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he would consider a pardon for Dr. Lee, Mr. Clinton was noncommittal. But he expressed sympathy for Dr. Lee, saying the scientist had been detained for ''a bailable offense, and it means he spent a lot of time in prison that any ordinary American wouldn't have and that bothers me.''</p>
        <p>Justice Department officials said the attorney general would not respond publicly to the president's criticism.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Ms. Reno expressed no regrets over the government's tactics even though the judge in the case, James A. Parker of Federal District Court in Albuquerque, said the scientist deserved an apology for harsh treatment that had ''embarrassed this entire nation.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno said, ''I think Dr. Lee had the opportunity from the beginning to resolve this matter and he chose not to and I think he must look to himself.''</p>
        <p>In a meeting with reporters, Ms. Reno said she wished ''with all my heart and soul'' that Dr. Lee had agreed earlier to provide investigators with information -- which he must do as part of the plea agreement -- about seven missing computer tapes onto which he transferred nuclear secrets.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Dr. Lee, Mark Holscher, said in an interview that Dr. Lee had offered in December to cooperate as part of a plea deal, a point Judge Parker also made in his scathing comments about the prosecution. But, Mr. Holscher said, the government never responded.</p>
        <p>Neither White House or Justice Department officials would say whether Mr. Clinton and Ms. Reno ever discussed the terms of Dr. Lee's confinement or other legal aspects of the case, although there was no indication that White House officials ever complained to the department.</p>
        <p>Some law enforcement officials said that they had sought to keep Dr. Lee confined to pressure him into pleading guilty or to confess to what a number of officials believed, but could never prove -- that he was a spy for Beijing. The officials now acknowledge that those tactics were wrong.</p>
        <p>Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, suggested today that the president would order a review of the government's handling of the case.</p>
        <p>''He'll be looking for some answers to how this came about,'' Mr. Lockhart said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lockhart seemed to soften Mr. Clinton's words, saying later that the president's comments were not intended ''as a blanket criticism of anyone.'' He also said in an interview that the president retained confidence in Ms. Reno.</p>
        <p>The president's blunt remarks seemed certain to heighten the furor over a case that, with its sudden collapse, has turned into a major embarrassment for Ms. Reno and other officials who favored the indictment, including Director Louis J. Freeh of the F.B.I. and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson said today in a statement, ''While there are some regrettable aspects about the way the case unfolded, the bottom line remains that Dr. Lee committed very serious security violations involving our nuclear secrets.''</p>
        <p>While Ms. Reno was appointed by  President Clinton, any direct involvement by the White House in discussions about whether and how to prosecute Dr. Lee would have been unusual. The department is supposed to operate independently from White House in prosecutorial matters, and Mr. Clinton's aides stayed out of such matters, since they had been criticized for involvement in an inquiry that followed death of Vincent W. Foster Jr., a deputy White House counsel who took his own life in 1993.</p>
        <p>Still, national security officials at the White House did know in advance about the lengthy felony indictment of Dr. Lee without raising apparent objections.</p>
        <p>Several days before Dr. Lee was charged in December, Ms. Reno, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Freeh met with senior intelligence officials at the White House, among them Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, and George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, to discuss the security implications of the case.</p>
        <p>Republicans in Congress, some of whom once complained that the government had moved too slowly in the case, shifted gears in the aftermath of the plea bargain to urge an inquiry into the government's conduct. Senate hearings will begin later this month, with Senator Arlen Specter,  Republican of Pennsylvania, as chairman.</p>
        <p>The government's decision to abandon a case that prosecutors had once compared to nuclear espionage shattered an uneasy calm that had settled over the Justice Department and the F.B.I. in the waning months of the Clinton presidency.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno and Mr. Freeh, whose once-close relationship has frayed over a series of internal battles, many involving questions about the need for independent prosecutors in cases involving the White House, were forced once again to close ranks and defend their actions. In Moscow today to attend meetings with Russian law enforcement officials, Mr Freeh refused to discuss the Lee case when asked about it by reporters.</p>
        <p>But the F.B.I. is expected to conduct a review of the case. Law enforcement officials said today that Mr. Freeh, a former federal judge, had instituted a policy of conducting internal inquiries when its agents had been criticized by federal judges.</p>
        <p>In a statement released after the guilty plea, Mr. Freeh said Dr. Lee had pleaded guilty to a serious offense. Mr. Freeh said much of the information that Dr. Lee removed from Los Alamos had been highly sensitive, disputing some weapons experts who said the government had vastly exaggerated the significance of the data.</p>
        <p>''While some of the information was not classified,'' Mr. Freeh's statement said, ''the government was prepared to prove that much of it was highly classified nuclear weapons information.''</p>
        <p>Even though Dr. Lee had to concede in his plea deal that the government had been justified in investigating the downloading, he has also decided to take legal action against the government, Brian Sun, one of his lawyers, said today.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee will revive a civil suit he filed against the Department of Energy, accusing the department of violating his privacy by releasing a large amount of confidential information on his background and its investigation of suspicions that he had spied for China.</p>
        <p>The civil suit was filed in December in Federal District Court in Washington, but the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, decided that it would have to wait for the end of Dr. Lee's criminal case, a common practice. Mr. Sun said that with the criminal prosecution concluded, the family wanted to move forward.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee is trying to win monetary damages from the government, but perhaps more important, Mr. Sun said, the family hopes to use the suit to obtain documents from the government concerning why Dr. Lee was singled out for prosecution.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee's lawyers had said that Dr. Lee had been unfairly identified for prosecution largely because he is Asian American. In one of the most important successes scored by the defense, Judge Parker ordered the government to hand over most of the documents so he could decide whether to give them to the defense so they could try to prove their claim.</p>
        <p>In accepting Dr. Lee's guilty plea on Wednesday, Judge Parker suggested it was unfortunate that he would not be able to review the documents because the criminal case was over.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sun said he was exploring whether he could seek the documents in the civil lawsuit, since Dr. Lee's plea said he ''waives any right to additional disclosure from the government in connection with the guilty plea.'' The judge in the civil case will probably have to decided whether the material is connected to the plea.</p>
