        <p>A court ordered an independent medical team today to determine whether the former president, Suharto, is fit to stand trial for corruption after he again declined a summons to appear in court, citing ill health. Mr. Suharto failed to appear when the trial began on Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>The hearing today opened just hours after a powerful car bomb exploded at the Jakarta Stock Exchange building on Wednesday, killing 15 people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suharto's continued absence and the intensifying violence in Jakarta at each stage of the case has increased pressure on the government to show that it has the will to prosecute Mr. Suharto. The police acknowledged that the latest explosion might be linked to bombings in recent weeks that the police had said were the work of supporters of Mr. Suharto.</p>
        <p>Senior government officials have accused military and political extremists linked to him of trying to derail the corruption trial.</p>
        <p>In an interview with Reuters, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said: ''There is a perception that any time the government raises the pressure on Mr. Suharto or any of his cronies, then these things happen. I think there are elements connected to the military establishment who make these incidents possible, rogue elements, of course.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Suharto, 79, is accused of stealing $571 million from the state and putting the money into businesses of his family and friends. His lawyers deny the charges and insist that he does not have the mental capacity to stand trial because of strokes suffered last year.</p>
        <p>Judge Lalu Mariyun, chief of the South Jakarta District Court, ordered physicians from the Indonesian Doctors Association and from three prominent universities to ''conduct a comprehensive medical checkup'' on Mr. Suharto and report to the judges at a hearing on Sept. 28.</p>
        <p>The government has so far declined to escort the former leader to court from his villa in Jakarta, where he lives under house arrest.</p>
        <p>The defendant's chair sat empty today while the five judges heard medical testimony from the prosecution and defense for three hours.</p>
