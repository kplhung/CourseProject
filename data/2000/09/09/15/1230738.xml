        <p>Directed by Aaron Harnick</p>
        <p>Not rated; 87 minutes</p>
        <p>The opening credits of ''30 Days'' may look a little familiar: plain white type on a black background, the cast listed all at once, a mellow old jazz tune on the soundtrack. But this is not a Woody Allen movie, despite the New York City locations -- the insides of apartments, mostly -- and the occasional moment of obligatory ethnic shtick. It's a romantic comedy that seems to have been pulled from the generic frozen-food section of the supermarket and brought up to room temperature in the microwave.</p>

        <p>The opening credits of ''30 Days'' may look a little familiar: plain white type on a black background, the cast listed all at once, a mellow old jazz tune on the soundtrack. But this is not a Woody Allen movie, despite the New York City locations -- the insides of apartments, mostly -- and the occasional moment of obligatory ethnic shtick. It's a romantic comedy that seems to have been pulled from the generic frozen-food section of the supermarket and brought up to room temperature in the microwave.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen's recent pictures have been described as slight and anecdotal. Compared to ''30 Days,'' they're ''The Battleship Potemkin.'' Small movies have their place, but this one is so much smaller than life that it barely registers on screen.</p>
        <p>Here's another story about men who won't grow up, are afraid of commitment and seem to spend most of their time thinking up new swear words to call one another and trading trivial observations on the odds and ends of daily life. Jordan Trainer (Ben Shenkman) is the main commitment-phobe. He works at his parents' liquor store, hangs out with his three friends (the vain, self-deluded one, the one who has his act together and the doofus) and mumbles his way through a series of dates.</p>
        <p>His act-together friend, Brad (Thomas McCarthy), fixes Jordan up with his fiancee's friend Sarah (Arija Bereikis), who has a job at NBC and a vague history of emotional distress. After a couple of false starts, they go to bed, race through the obligatory romantic montage (Central Park, flowers, etc.) and endure the awkward dinner with the parents. (Jordan's mom shows Sarah his naked baby pictures.) Then they have their first fight and break up, and Jordan spends the rest of the movie trying to win Sarah back.</p>
        <p>There's nothing wrong with sticking to the conventions of genre. The problem is that ''30 Days'' consists of nothing but the conventions, without any animating complication or insight. It seems to be written in shorthand, with minimal dialogue and no sense of how emotions might be conveyed, other than by the use of sappy folk music. Important scenes -- the dinner, the fight -- end abruptly, as if the director, Aaron Harnick, aware that he was trafficking in cliches, felt he needed only to indicate them, like the comedian in the old joke who assigned numbers to all his gags and thought shouting out ''27'' would be enough to bring down the house.</p>
        <p>There are a few clever moments. As Mike, the doofus, Alexander Chaplin does some nice low-key riffing. But if Mr. Shenkman were any more understated, he'd be asleep. Jordan's passivity has an interesting hostile edge, but it is never clear what attracts Sarah in the first place. Ms. Bareikis has an alluring glow and the ability to suggest complex emotion, but her character is not so much underwritten as left blank.</p>
