        <p>Correction of Sept 11 brief report on settlement of dispute over some types of digital television sets made by Hitachi and Toshiba, regarding adjoining picture</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A report in the Compressed Data column of Business Day on Monday about the settlement of a dispute over some types of digital television sets made by Hitachi and Toshiba referred incorrectly to the adjoining picture. It showed a standard high-definition TV, which has a wide screen -- not the type covered by the settlement. The companies gained the right to use the high-definition label for sets that have nearly square screens, so long as they notify buyers that the picture will have a lower resolution than that of a standard high-definition set.</p>
