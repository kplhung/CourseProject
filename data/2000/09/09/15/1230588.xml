      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>EVERCLEAR: ''Songs From an American Movie, Volume I: Learning How to Smile'' (Capitol). What are memories for? Art P. Alexakis of Everclear ponders that question on ''Songs From an American Movie, Volume I.'' Mr. Alexakis, 38, isn't afraid to admit he has a long past, and he seesaws between weighing what he has done and trying to forget it. In the album's single, ''AM Radio,'' he borrows the strutting riff from Jean Knight's ''Mr. Big Stuff'' to rap-sing fond reminiscences of the 1970's. But in ''Here We Go Again,'' he fends off a new girlfriend's questions, saying, ''I do not want you to know me the way I used to be.''</p>
        <p>''Songs'' is a post-divorce album. Mr. Alexakis observes the collapsing marriage, hurls his final barbs and worries about the effects on the child. He pins his hopes on a new love, vowing not to make the old mistakes. And with ''Unemployed Boyfriend,'' he comes up with the perfect modern come-on.</p>

        <p>EVERCLEAR: ''Songs From an American Movie, Volume I: Learning How to Smile'' (Capitol). What are memories for? Art P.

        <p>''Songs'' is a post-divorce album. Mr. Alexakis observes the collapsing marriage, hurls his final barbs and worries about the effects on the child. He pins his hopes on a new love, vowing not to make the old mistakes. And with ''Unemployed Boyfriend,'' he comes up with the perfect modern come-on.</p>
        <p>The album started as a solo project for Mr. Alexakis, and it moves away from Everclear's usual punky, guitar-charged rock toward AM-radio music he remembers: country-rock, the Beach Boys, the string-laden pop of Electric Light Orchestra. Despite some overdone moments, like the remake of Van Morrison's ''Brown-Eyed Girl,'' most of the album turns Mr. Alexakis's ups and downs into tuneful, broad-shouldered rock.</p>
