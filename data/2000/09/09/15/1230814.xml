        <p>Editorial regrets that there will be no live coverage of Olympic competition this year because of great time difference between Australia and United States; says what will be seen are events in repackaged form that television executives believe caters to American taste for celebrity and high drama</p>

        <p>When the Olympic Games were first broadcast live, from Cortina in the winter of 1956, the final torch-bearer at the opening ceremony tripped and fell over a television cable laid across the stadium. There is something deeply emblematic in that moment. It captures what has been, at times, an awkward synergy between television and the Olympics.

        <p>In 1960, CBS paid $50,000 for the American television rights to the Winter Games in Squaw Valley and offered 15 hours of coverage. For the Sydney Olympics, NBC has paid $705 million -- in rights only, not production costs -- and will, with its cable stations, televise 441 1/2 hours of coverage. That is just slightly less than the total of all American televised Olympics coverage between Squaw Valley in 1960 and Sarajevo in 1984. And then there is Internet coverage.</p>

        <p>When the Olympic Games were first broadcast live, from Cortina in the winter of 1956, the final torch-bearer at the opening ceremony tripped and fell over a television cable laid across the stadium. There is something deeply emblematic in that moment. It captures what has been, at times, an awkward synergy between television and the Olympics. And yet for nearly all of us, the Olympic experience is fundamentally a television experience, and it is television revenue that has driven the expansion of the Games, as it has driven the expansion of all sports.</p>
        <p>In 1960, CBS paid $50,000 for the American television rights to the Winter Games in Squaw Valley and offered 15 hours of coverage. For the Sydney Olympics, NBC has paid $705 million -- in rights only, not production costs -- and will, with its cable stations, televise 441 1/2 hours of coverage. That is just slightly less than the total of all American televised Olympics coverage between Squaw Valley in 1960 and Sarajevo in 1984. And then there is Internet coverage.</p>
        <p>Olympiad after Olympiad, we watch the Games with the mingling of sophistication and naivete that television always elicits from us. The intimacy and familiarity one often feels by the third or fourth night of watching the Olympics is really a measure of the intimacy Americans feel toward their televisions. The Games have changed in almost every respect over the past 30 or 40 years. Far more countries participate. New sports have been added and old ones dropped. Technology has transformed the Games, changing the way athletes dress to compete, how they prepare, and the manner in which they are timed and measured and televised. Yet for many Americans, the changes in the Olympics are best summed up in the evolution from Jim McKay to Bob Costas.</p>
        <p>This year, because of the great time difference between Australia and the United States, there will be no live coverage of the competition. That will mean a real loss in transmitting the natural excitement of the Games. What we will get instead from Sydney is a seamless package of events and features, an oscillation between tight focus on contests and tight focus on individuals and their lives -- up close and personal, as ABC taught us to say.</p>
        <p>It will be easy to believe that we are learning a lot about Australia, about team handball, about Marion Jones and her American and international colleagues. But as always when television is at the center of our attention, we will mostly be observing events in a repackaged form that television executives believe caters to the American taste for celebrity and high drama. Some games, like baseball and soccer, contain an inherent narrative of their own. But most Olympic events lack that kind of integral narrative. There are heats and finals, winners and losers. There is mostly the extraordinary effort of individuals. What television will bring us night after night is what it believes we most crave: reality shaped into one story after another.</p>
