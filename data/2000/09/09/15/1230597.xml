        <p>High Fidelity</p>
        <p>As the manager of Championship Vinyl, a Chicago record store, Rob (John Cusack, left, with Iben Hjejle) is so immersed in pop culture that he gives hit-parade rankings to the most important events in his life.</p>
        <p>At No. 5 in his former-girlfriend ratings, Laura (Ms.  Hjejle) joins a string of vibrant women (Shannon Stillo, Joelle Carter, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor) in Stephen Frears's fine-tuned adaptation of Nick Hornsby's novel.</p>
        <p>''Even more than the book,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, ''the movie evokes the turmoil of urban single life with a quirky mixture of confessional poignancy and dry, self-deflating humor.''</p>
        <p>2000. Touchstone. $107.37; DVD, $32.99. 113 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Sept. 19.</p>
        <p>Me Myself I</p>
        <p>Thanks to a fairy godmotherly intercession, Pamela Drury (Rachel Griffiths), a lonely single woman approaching 40, gets to live the life she might have pursued as the wife of Robert Dickson (David Roberts), the true love she left 13 years earlier. Yes, those three demanding children are hers now, as is all the dirty laundry.</p>
        <p>Sex with Robert is fine and another love interest appears for Pamela, played by Ms. Griffiths with a fine, high-strung intelligence. But while Pip Karmel's film maintains a comfortable balance between fantasy and realism, it ''isn't much more than a Cosmo girl's daydream'' (Holden).</p>
        <p>1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37; DVD, $24.99. 104 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Sept. 19.</p>
        <p>28 Days</p>
        <p>Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock), a New York writer (of what we're never told), lives fast and drunkenly until a car crash lands her in a rehabilitation center. Deprived of alcohol and her Vicodin, Gwen gets mighty cranky with her counselor but later settles into her four-week stay with a choppy series of seriocomic bits that lurch between sitcom-y silliness and soap-opera schmaltz. Before long a film that starts with promise ''skids out of control and begins to weave around as unsteadily as its central character does'' (Holden).</p>
        <p>2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37; DVD, $24.95. 103 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Sept. 19.</p>
        <p>A Map of the World</p>
        <p>One day a beleaguered school nurse and farm wife named Alice Goodwin (Sigourney Weaver) loses track of a friend's child, who drowns in a pond on the Goodwin land. Without dwelling on tragedy, the story turns to the rogue self-destructiveness it unleashes in Alice, who eventually ends up in jail and turns coldly critical of her own life with her husband (David Strathairn). But Scott Elliott's film, adapted from Jane Hamilton's novel, ''would have been better had it clung to that toughness, rather than showing how Alice's stay in jail makes jail a better place'' (Janet Maslin).</p>
        <p>1999. USA. $56.49; DVD, $24.95. 125 minutes. R. Release date: Sept. 19.</p>
        <p>Keep in Mind</p>
        <p>Video's current top three renters, ''Erin Brockovich,'' ''The Cider House Rules'' and ''Reindeer Games,'' played on thousands of theater screens. Here are a few examples from Video Business magazine's list of best renters among films that played on 475 screens or fewer.</p>
        <p>TITUS. Julie Taymor's film turns Shakespeare's bloody tale into a fluid time-traveling fantasia of violence and revenge that has the look of a sophisticated video game. 1999. Fox. $104.16; DVD, $34.98. 160 minutes. R.</p>
        <p>BOYS DON'T CRY. A best renter since April, Kimberly Pierce's film stars Hilary Swank as Teena Brandon, a lanky high school girl who turns her name around and becomes a boy in the small town of Falls City, Neb. 1999. Fox. $104.16; DVD, $34.98. R.</p>
        <p>GUN SHY. Ever since the federal agent Charlie Mayo (Liam Neeson) was tortured face down in a pile of watermelon, he has been trying to get his nerve back. 2000. Hollywood. $104.16; DVD, $29.99. 102 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>THE STRAIGHT STORY. The elderly Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) decides to drive his lawn mower from Iowa to Wisconsin to see his estranged brother (Harry Dean Stanton). Directed by David Lynch, believe it or not. 1999. Disney. $104.16. 111 minutes. Closed captioned. G.</p>
        <p>HOLY SMOKE. The headstrong Ruth Barron (Kate Winslet) proves more than a match for the ''cult exiter'' (Harvey Keitel) hired by her family to break her away from her Indian guru. 1999. Miramax. $104.16; DVD, $29.99. 114 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>MANSFIELD PARK. Treated like a poor relation, Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor) makes her mark on the estate of the pompous slave trader Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter). 1999. Miramax. $104.16; DVD, $29.99. 110 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.</p>
