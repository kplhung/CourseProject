        <p>Chinese officials released details today surrounding the rape charges that have been filed here against the leader of a besieged healing sect who sneaked into American territory in January and is seeking political asylum in the United States.</p>
        <p>The asylum request, by Zhang Hongbao, founder of a large spiritual movement called Zhong Gong, has posed a difficult choice for the American immigration service: The United States wants to foster the mutual extradition of criminals with China, and failure to turn over Mr. Zhang -- who arrived in Guam with a fake Chinese passport -- would be deeply resented by Beijing.</p>

        <p>Chinese officials released details today surrounding the rape charges that have been filed here against the leader of a besieged healing sect who sneaked into American territory in January and is seeking political asylum in the United States.</p>
        <p>The asylum request, by Zhang Hongbao, founder of a large spiritual movement called Zhong Gong, has posed a difficult choice for the American immigration service: The United States wants to foster the mutual extradition of criminals with China, and failure to turn over Mr. Zhang -- who arrived in Guam with a fake Chinese passport -- would be deeply resented by Beijing.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Zhang insists he is a victim of political persecution and American officials know that given Beijing's campaign to crush his organization, he is extremely unlikely to receive a fair trial. They also know that charges of rape or other criminal activities have sometimes been trumped up by Chinese authorities to silence dissidents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zhang, 46, is in detention in Guam, awaiting an immigration decision this month.</p>
        <p>Today, in an apparent effort to bolster their case, officials here took the unusual step of providing copies to a small number of foreign journalists of what they said were statements by rape victims, the victims' photographs (with eyes blacked out), arrest warrants and other documents. These were a portion of the evidence given to the United States government, a Chinese official said.</p>
        <p>The materials were provided on condition that the supposed victims not be fully identified, and that the office be concealed.</p>
        <p>''We want to repatriate Zhang Hongbao because he broke the law, not because of his work with Zhong Gong,'' said the official.</p>
        <p>The crackdown on Zhong Gong and other independently organized ''qigong'' societies, devoted to the cultivation of cosmic energies to enhance physical and moral well-being, started last year after one group, Falun Gong, held illegal demonstrations and was outlawed as an ''evil cult.''</p>
        <p>The closing in recent months of hundreds of Zhong Gong businesses and the arrest of several leaders, the official insisted, were because of tax fraud and other illegal business activities.</p>
        <p>Zhong Gong -- its full name translates as China Health Care and Wisdom Enhancement Practice -- is one of the largest of many groups that arose in the last two decades using traditional concepts of qi (energy) in gong (ritual exercises) to promote health and enlightenment. Its Web site is www.ZGZG.net.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zhang founded Zhong Gong in 1988, four years before the start of Falun Gong, and by the early 1990's it claimed tens of millions of followers. Mr. Zhang set himself up as the ''master'' and made extravagant claims that his followers could attain supernatural powers.</p>
        <p>As his organization and related businesses grew -- outside the control of the Communist Party -- it clashed with local authorities.</p>
        <p>According to the documents provided today, the authenticity of which could not be verified, back in 1990, a Ms. Li accused Mr. Zhang of raping her on June 26 in his Beijing office, where he had summoned her for ''special healing.''</p>
        <p>In May 1991, the materials indicate, the Beijing police issued a ''notice of detention'' but Mr. Zhang was never picked up, according to the account, because he had moved and had begun using a pseudonym and forged identity documents, copies of which were provided.</p>
        <p>But in the ensuing years, Mr. Zhang also set up a large, well-known healing center in Sichuan province.</p>
        <p>The two other signed testimonies provided today -- from a Ms. Guo and a Ms. Zhang, describing events that supposedly occurred in Sichuan in 1994 -- were recorded by the police only in November and December 1999, after the campaign to destroy Zhong Gong was under way and Mr. Zhang had gone into hiding.</p>
        <p>Ms. Guo's statement says Mr. Zhang had her come into his office, where he ''forced me to touch and play with his penis.''</p>
        <p>The woman named Zhang alleges that Mr. Zhang raped her in the same office, claiming that ''men and women had to complement each other, like yin and yang, to cure disease.'' Her testimony describes features of Mr. Zhang's penis and his pubic hair and other intimate details.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zhang was formally charged with rape, and a warrant was issued on June 7 this year, five months after he had arrived in Guam seeking asylum.</p>
