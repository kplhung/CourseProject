        <p>THE MEDIA</p>
        <p>THE AD SEASON -- Television stations around the country are expected to benefit from this year's bounty of political commercials to the tune of $1 billion, according to a Washington group that pushes for better campaign coverage by the news media. The Alliance for Better Campaigns, which is headed by Paul Taylor, a former political reporter, released data showing that as of July 31, local television stations in the top 75 media markets had taken in $211 million from the broadcast of 286,737 spots. The bulk of the commercials appear in the final months leading up to the November election. At a news conference, Mr. Taylor, joined by Senator John McCain of Arizona, called on local stations to devote five minutes of their news programs to issues and discourse by the candidates on each of the last 30 days of the campaign, as recommended by a presidential commission. So far, the alliance said, only 42 stations, or 3 percent of the industry, have said they will try to meet that standard.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>EVERYBODY IS A COMEDIAN -- They will both be keeping their day jobs, but Vice President Al Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, tried their hand at comedy yesterday. Coached by his daughter Kristin, a professional comedy writer, Mr. Gore made jokes at the expense of his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, on CBS's ''Late Show'' with David Letterman. Mr. Gore showed a film of him and Mr. Lieberman before a microphone at a rally. ''Hey Joe,'' Mr. Gore whispered, ''I've got to go on the Letterman show. That show is so lame.'' Mr. Lieberman responded, ''Oh yeah, big time.'' Mr. Lieberman appeared on NBC's ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' and Comedy Central's ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.'' To prepare for the vice presidency, Mr. Lieberman told Mr. Stewart: ''I've been watching old Carson reruns to learn from Ed McMahon what I should do. 'Yes, sir, I never thought of that, that was brilliant.' '' Mr. Lieberman, the first Jew on a major party's national ticket, told Mr. O'Brien that he and Vice President Al Gore are considering new slogans, like ''Gore-Lieberman: no bull, no pork'' and ''With malice toward none, but a little guilt for everyone.''</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>A VICTORY FOR NADER -- Ralph Nader may still be bumping along near the bottom in the polls, but he has scored one victory in his uphill run for the White House. A federal court in New York has rejected an effort by MasterCard to stop his parody of its ''Priceless'' advertising campaign, finding on Tuesday that the company had not proved it was being harmed by the Nader spot. MasterCard had argued that the parody infringed on its copyright and created the appearance that the company was making an endorsement. Mr. Nader, long a critic of big corporations, countered that his parody was protected by free speech rights. The MasterCard advertisements typically show a sequence of goods or services and their values followed by an intangible -- like ''a day when all you have to do is breathe,'' followed by the word ''priceless.'' The Nader advertisements say: ''Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser: $1,000 a plate. Campaign ads filled with half-truths: $10 million. Promises to special interest groups: over $10 billion. Finding out the truth: priceless. There are some things money can't buy.''</p>

        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>BACK TO BOB JONES -- By loudly criticizing Hollywood for its glorification of violence and sex, the Republican and Democratic presidential tickets have stolen one of the issue horses Patrick J. Buchanan has ridden in his many campaigns. Not to be outdone, Mr. Buchanan, who now appears to be the official candidate of the Reform Party, has scheduled a speech for Monday on ''Hollywood and the Cultural War,'' which a press release described as a ''battle cry.'' The site of the speech is almost as telling as the subject: Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C., a favorite conservative audience of Mr. Buchanan's and one that Gov. George W. Bush addressed this year before the South Carolina primary. Mr. Bush was criticized for that appearance because of certain university policies, but this has never bothered Mr. Buchanan. ''It'll be a good one,'' promises Mr. Buchanan's press director, Brian Doherty.</p>
