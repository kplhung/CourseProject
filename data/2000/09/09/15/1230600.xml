        <p>In addition to its title, there are a few other things about ''Crime and Punishment in Suburbia'' that might lead you to believe it has something to do with Dostoyevsky, including a portentous quotation from the Russian novelist that appears on the screen before the action starts, and the name of the film's heroine, which is Roseanne Skolnik (Monica Keena) -- kind of like Raskolnikov, get it? But you will search in vain for Dostoyevskian themes, or indeed any themes at all. The Russian writer whose influence is most in evidence may be Chekhov, and then only because his oft-cited remark that a gun on the mantelpiece in the first act of a play must be fired in the third act is given an indie-film paraphrase: the electric carving knife used by Mom to slice up the roast in an early scene will be used to slice up Daddy later on.</p>
        <p>Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov murdered an innocent old woman to test his theories that superior human beings can act free of ordinary moral constraints. Roseanne decides to kill her stepfather after he rapes her. It's not quite the same idea, but then again this film, directed with more attitude than discipline by Rob Schmidt from an addlepated script by Larry Gross, mopes along without a thought in its head, confusing its own vacuity with the alienation of its characters.</p>

        <p>In addition to its title, there are a few other things about ''Crime and Punishment in Suburbia'' that might lead you to believe it has something to do with Dostoyevsky, including a portentous quotation from the Russian novelist that appears on the screen before the action starts, and the name of the film's heroine, which is Roseanne Skolnik (Monica Keena) -- kind of like Raskolnikov, get it? But you will search in vain for Dostoyevskian themes, or indeed any themes at all. The Russian writer whose influence is most in evidence may be Chekhov, and then only because his oft-cited remark that a gun on the mantelpiece in the first act of a play must be fired in the third act is given an indie-film paraphrase: the electric carving knife used by Mom to slice up the roast in an early scene will be used to slice up Daddy later on.</p>
        <p>Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov murdered an innocent old woman to test his theories that superior human beings can act free of ordinary moral constraints. Roseanne decides to kill her stepfather after he rapes her. It's not quite the same idea, but then again this film, directed with more attitude than discipline by Rob Schmidt from an addlepated script by Larry Gross, mopes along without a thought in its head, confusing its own vacuity with the alienation of its characters.</p>
        <p>Vincent (Vincent Kartheiser), the disaffected loner whose sexual fantasies about Roseanne provide the movie with its heavy-breathing, in-and-out-of-focus credit sequence, starts out as a high school nihilist, tattooing the words ''por nada'' on his arm. But then later on he turns out to be some kind of Christian new-age guru, sporting a big blue Jesus T-shirt and trying to assuage poor Roseanne's tormented soul with self-help cliches. ''What a strange path it took to find my heart,'' she marvels at the end. Yes, but if you're a connoisseur of pseudorebellious American cinema it will seem awfully familiar.</p>
        <p>Completed before the release of ''American Beauty,'' this contrived, puffed up little picture nonetheless seems like a ripoff, perhaps because it mines the same tired assumptions and unexamined stereotypes about suburban family life. Like Wes Bentley's video stalker in ''American Beauty,'' Vincent sneaks around with a camera recording Roseanne's intimate moments. He talks (in the voiceover narration) about his plans to rescue her from the hell her life has become. Her mother (Ellen Barkin) and stepfather (Michael Ironside) sulk and bellow through the endgame of a marriage; mom is moody and adulterous, dad expresses his frustration through drink and sarcasm. Roseanne seeks comfort in the arms of her football-playing boyfriend, Jimmy (James DeBello).</p>
        <p>At first you think the usual teen-movie archetypes -- the battle between the narcissistic jock and the sensitive misfit for the love of the secretly soulful popular girl -- are being cleverly subverted. Jimmy seems like a nice enough guy, if a little dim. There seems to be some sexual chemistry between him and Roseanne, and if he occasionally tries to beat up Vincent, it may be because the little creep has it coming.</p>
        <p>But the only thing ''Crime and Punishment in Suburbia'' ends up subverting is itself. In the absence of any real insight into its characters and situations, the film falls back on visual atmospherics and soundtrack pyrotechnics. There's lots of great music, and some of the camerawork has a beautiful, expressive fluidity. But try as they might, the showy effects -- the dream episodes, freeze frames and slow-motion sequences, the artful sound mixing and the division of the narrative into ''chapters'' -- can't compensate for the basic emptiness of the story.</p>
        <p>Extensive use of voiceover is often a sign of trouble, a last-ditch attempt to pull a film into shape when the resources of cinematic storytelling have failed. The fact that ''Crime and Punishment'' switches from one character's narration to another's without explanation is the final evidence of its disastrous incoherence, its lack of a consistent point of view.</p>
        <p>A lot of talent is wasted here. Ms. Barkin and Mr. Ironside give some emotional weight to their cardboard characters, and Jeffrey Wright (as Mrs. Skolnik's lover) dispels some of the pervasive gloom with his physical grace and quick intelligence. The younger members of the cast do less well, but it's hardly their fault. Ms. Keena's soft, melancholy loveliness is especially ill-used; the filmmakers can't decide whether Roseanne is meant to be an object of pity, satire, or just lecherous ogling.</p>
        <p>By the end, when Roseanne seems to have shut down her emotions entirely, you suspect you are witnessing not the character reacting to the turmoil in her life but the actress protecting herself from the mess that surrounds her.</p>
        <p>''Crime and Punishment in Suburbia'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes a grisly murder and several heavy-breathing (though not terribly explicit) sex scenes.</p>

        <p>FILM REVIEW  Correction:  September 16, 2000, Saturday  A film review headline in Weekend yesterday about ''Crime and Punishment in Suburbia'' misidentified the character who kills Fred, the father. It is not the mother, Maggie; it is the daughter, Roseanne, with her boyfriend, Jimmy.</p>
