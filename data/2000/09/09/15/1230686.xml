        <p>Tiger Woods signed a five-year endorsement contract with Nike yesterday that is believed to be worth $85 million, making it the richest endorsement deal in sports history.</p>
        <p>The exact worth of the contract is hard to estimate because some of the value is tied to sales and incentives. But having already won three major championships and nine tournaments this year, Woods has continued his incredible 2000 run with an unprecedented endorsement deal that will continue his strong relationship with Nike. Woods has his own Nike line of clothing and shoes, he switched to a Nike golf ball in May, and he appears regularly in Nike commercials. Woods's current five-year, $40 million deal with Nike expires in September 2001.</p>
        <p>The new deal, which runs through September 2006, will begin when his current deal expires.</p>
        <p>Bob Wood, the president of Nike Golf, refused to reveal specifics of the deal, but he was elated that an agreement had been reached.</p>
        <p>''The final details were worked out about 90 minutes ago,'' Wood said last night from his office in Beaverton, Ore.</p>
        <p>''We've been negotiating for about 18 months, but I.M.G., Nike, and Tiger have all been in the same ballpark for awhile now,'' Wood continued. ''A lot of people thought we overpaid for Tiger in his original deal, but we don't feel we overpaid for him then, and we don't feel we overpaid for him now. We think it's a fair deal for everybody. He's had a huge impact on Nike and on Nike golf, and we think that will continue for the next 25 years or more.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people have compared Tiger to Michael Jordan, but one thing that makes them different is that the career of a professional golfer is so much longer than the career of a basketball player. The earning power of a professional golfer is far greater over the course of a lifetime. We're looking forward to extending our relationship with Tiger for the duration of his career, which will extend for the next 20 to 25 years and beyond.''</p>
        <p>At 24, Woods has won all four major championships, becoming the youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam, and he holds the career scoring record in all majors in relation to par. Television ratings for tournaments increased dramatically when Woods plays, and his galleries are by far the largest on tour, attracting record-setting crowds to tournaments.</p>
        <p>Woods signed a five-year $30 million endorsement deal with Buick worth $30 million earlier this year, and he has endorsement contracts with several other companies. Obviously, Woods is financially secure for several lifetimes, but his father, Earl Woods, said that no business deals would diminish Woods's intensity.</p>
        <p>''For Tiger, it has never been about the money,'' Earl Woods said yesterday from his home in Cypress, Calif. ''I have a kid who is basically self-motivated, and for that, I thank the Lord. He doesn't need someone waving dollar signs in front of his face to get him going. His performance isn't going to drop off just because he signs a deal, or earns a certain amount of money. Tiger has no comfort zone when it comes to competition. People don't believe me, but he's going to get much better. We've only seen the tip of the iceberg.''</p>
        <p>Nike is considering making golf clubs as well in the future, but Wood said the company had not made a final decision.</p>
        <p>Woods will make his next appearance at the President's Cup in mid-October. Having already won a record-setting $8.2 million this year, he could become the first player to reach $10 million in earnings in a single year.</p>
