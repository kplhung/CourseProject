        <p>Having seen the appalling conditions in Louisiana's private juvenile correctional facilities, I was pleased that the state, in a settlement of several lawsuits, agreed to ''sweeping changes,'' including improvements in mental health care (news article, Sept. 8).

        <p>Having seen the appalling conditions in Louisiana's private juvenile correctional facilities, I was pleased that the state, in a settlement of several lawsuits, agreed to ''sweeping changes,'' including improvements in mental health care (news article, Sept. 8). While this is a victory, many of the country's 100,000 incarcerated young people -- disproportionately poor children of color -- continue to be mistreated.</p>
        <p>These vulnerable children with histories of abuse, learning problems and mental illness are shackled, beaten, deprived of adequate health care or held in isolation. Policy makers must take greater responsibility for the young people who have been neglected and discarded by society.</p>
