        <p>The ebullient architect and designer Alexander Girard (1907-1993) once declared himself more interested in atmospheres than in buildings. And atmospheres are what his work is about. A designer of fabrics, graphics, interiors, furniture, tableware, radio cabinets and much else, he brought to his creations a vivid sense of civilized living with more than a touch of panache.</p>
        <p>He devised a home of elegant yet inviting spaces for the J. Irwin Miller family in Columbus, Ind. (1955-58), served up a brilliant medley of Latin American motifs for the New York restaurant La Fonda del Sol (1961) and from the 1950's to the early 70's designed more than 300 fabrics and wallpapers for the textile division of the Herman Miller (no relation to J. Irwin) Furniture Company that pulse with color and rhythmic patterns. His whimsical, sometimes flamboyant sensibility permeated everything he did.</p>
        <p>''The Opulent Eye of Alexander Girard,'' at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, is the first comprehensive show devoted to Girard, who seems to have lacked the recognition accorded his colleagues Eero Saarinen, Charles and Ray Eames and George Nelson. It can be argued that Girard was basically a middlebrow designer, less a theorist and inventor than they were, and more involved with showmanship. His forte was fabrics and interiors, domestic and commercial. The few pieces of furniture he designed for the airport waiting rooms of Braniff International Airways in 1966 seem timorous and derivative.</p>
        <p>But spontaneity and joy were hallmarks of his work, and there is no denying that over all it has had an influence, even among present-day practitioners. ''He has urged each of us toward a more personal and expressive way of life,'' wrote the fabric designer Jack Lenor Larsen in Design Quarterly.</p>
        <p>Well organized by Donald Albrecht, adjunct curator for special projects, the show is a packed but lively installation. It displays fabrics, sketches, collages, interiors, exteriors, furnishings, tableware, graphic designs and other Girardiana, including a group of rather kitschy dolls he designed. Here, too, are photographs and films on his work, plus many examples of the folk art he collected, which often served as inspiration, as the show makes clear.</p>
        <p>With modernism as his core belief, Girard -- known to colleagues as Sandro -- saw himself as ''a reasonable and sane functionalist tempered by irrational frivolity.'' He wanted home decor to be accessible, affordable and personal. His contribution to contemporary design was a freedom of approach that encompassed all sorts of visual stimuli, from Italian stage sets to Mexican folk art to motifs from modern technology. He made use of color, pattern, texture and ornament with a vibrancy that seemed to catch the beat of the 1960's.</p>
        <p>He pushed for convenience and informality by combining different kinds of furnishings, accessories and tableware that avoided the deadly matched look; devising walls for storage and display that looked into other spaces; and inventing a cozy semi-enclosure known as the ''conversation pit,'' a cushiony retreat that encouraged sit-down talk in the living room.</p>
        <p>Girard was very good at public areas, too, particularly restaurants. The show presents examples of his interior done in Op Art and Art Deco styles -- fabrics and furnishings in glorious black and white, including tables in the form of petaled flowers for L'Etoile'' (1965), a very smart but short-lived restaurant that once inhabited the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.</p>
        <p>But his greatest extravaganza was La Fonda del Sol, the Latin American dining complex installed by Restaurant Associates in the old Time and Life Building. Girard saluted its banquet of Latin American foods with folk art and themes from the same culture. As he did for L'Etoile, he designed a total environment for La Fonda, from the room's canopy, festooned with embroidered Colombian skirts, to the folk dolls used as decoration, to the geometrically patterned buttons on the waiters' jackets. The leitmotif, shown here, was a great golden sun of hammered brass and antique glass that majestically shone down on diners.</p>
        <p>The exhibition devotes a good deal of space to Girard's fabric designs, with an entire room for the textiles he did for Herman Miller. Always abstract, to avoid the distortion that occurs when representational images are subjected to the folds of hanging cloth, the designs, often geometric, are sometimes derived from folk art motifs. In their freshness of color and pattern they exuberantly push the envelope of middle-class taste.</p>
        <p>Among the highlights of his fabric designs are ''Manhattan'' (1958), a bouncy image of the skyline at night, and the intricate ''Cut-Out'' (1954-57), a drapery for the master bedroom of the Miller house in Indiana. Although ''Cut-Out'' is flat, it combines color and black shadow to give it the three-dimensional look of sculpture. A more famous one is ''Feathers'' (1957), an overall pattern of small diamonds in blue and mustard colors derived from the plumage used in Peruvian and Hawaiian ceremonial cloaks.</p>
        <p>Girard's love of folkways and of theater apparently surfaced in his childhood, with a fascination for Nativity creches. (An early acquisition is in the show.) Born in New York to an American mother and an Italian father, he grew up in Italy and was trained as an architect. He practiced in Rome for a while, but it was a stint as a designer for the Nordiska department store in Stockholm that put him in touch with the craft-based modernism underlying his own style.</p>
        <p>In 1932 he returned to New York, where he did domestic interiors and restaurants in a retro rococo mode, as several drawings in the show attest. Five years later he and his wife, Susan, moved to Detroit, then a budding design center, where they stayed for some 15 years before permanently settling into a historic adobe house in Santa Fe, N.M.</p>
        <p>By the early 1950's Girard's thinking in newer terms was bringing him recognition. He packaged two of the influential ''Good Design'' exhibitions for the Museum of Modern Art and the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, and a backlighted photograph of silhouetted objects he arranged in the 1953 show makes a stunning wall in the exhibition. In 1958 he did a spectacular showroom for Herman Miller in San Francisco, using gold leaf, garish paint, a mirrored carousel and theatrical lighting to highlight the Victorian excesses of the building as a setting for displays of supercool 50's Miller furniture, designed by others.</p>
        <p>Textiles and Objects, the Herman Miller showroom in Manhattan that Girard designed in 1961, is on view in a specially commissioned three-dimensional model. It displayed more than 100 of his fabric designs, surrounded by bright arrangements of folkish figures (designed by Girard's brother Tunsi, and others), mirrors, pillows and other domestic accessories.</p>
        <p>If Girard was not one of the real heavyweights in American design, he was one of its liveliest figures, as this show happily affirms. A nice endpiece to the exhibition, incidentally, is the Cooper-Hewitt's tiny Design Museum Cafe, adorned with overhead placards bearing quotes about Girard from colleagues and friends. They were designed in a playful spirit by the graphic artist Deborah Sussman, a colleague and longtime friend.</p>
        <p>''The Opulent Eye of Alexander Girard'' is at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan, (212) 849-8400, through March 18.</p>
