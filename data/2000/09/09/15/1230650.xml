        <p>The European Central Bank took a limited step today toward intervening in world markets on behalf of the downtrodden euro, using money from its foreign reserves to buy $2.16 billion worth of euros and briefly halting the currency's tailspin against the dollar.</p>
        <p>Wim Duisenberg, the European bank's president, insisted that the move was little more than a routine portfolio adjustment and that ''intervening in the market was not part of the motive.'' But currency analysts said the bank was indeed hoping to prop up the euro's exchange rate, or at least prevent its falling further.</p>
        <p>Even so, the central bank seems increasingly powerless to reverse the euro's decline. Since it was introduced in January 1999, the currency has lost more than one-quarter of its value against the dollar, falling from $1.17 initially to settle in New York today at 86.41 cents, up from 86.01 late Wednesday. Shortly after today's announcement, it traded in Europe around 87 cents.</p>
        <p>Central bankers and political leaders have tried to talk up the euro's value, arguing at every opportunity that its low exchange rate does not reflect the fundamental economic health of Western Europe. The central bank has also raised interest rates six times in the last year, though with little effect.</p>
        <p>Intervention in the markets, by selling dollars and buying euros, is one of the few tools that has not been employed on a full scale. But generally, central bankers view intervention as futile, given that trillions of dollars flow across borders every day. The chances of success are seen as particularly low because neither the United States nor Japan has shown much appetite for joining in an intervention.</p>
        <p>Indeed, some analysts now predict that the euro will slip further in the weeks ahead. Jesper Dannesboe, chief foreign exchange strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, went so far as to warn of the risk of a ''panic sell-off'' because many investment funds are holding euros they bought at prices well above today's level. He predicts that the euro will slip as low as 80 cents to the dollar by early 2001.</p>
        <p>The euro's decline does have some positive effects: it has helped European exporters by rendering their products more affordable overseas. It is also making Europe look cheaper than it has in years to American tourists, who are coming here in great numbers and buying local products to take home with them. But on the negative side, it has intensified the effects of the worldwide rise in crude oil prices, as oil is priced in dollars on world commodities markets. And it is pushing up the costs of other imports, too.</p>
        <p>In its move to buy euros today, the central bank said it had simply decided to sell the interest it had accumulated on its foreign reserves since it went into operation at the start of 1999. In itself, that shift of 2.5 billion euros is not sufficient to have a lasting effect on currency markets. More aggressive steps are needed, some European economists say, maintaining that the bank should be selling some of the reserves themselves, not just the interest on them.</p>
        <p>The problem confronting the European Central Bank is that foreign investors are pouring tens of billions of dollars into American investments. Much of that is through mergers and acquisitions, with companies like Deutsche Telekom and Bertelsmann eager to buy American companies or parts of them. In addition, analysts say that many investment fund managers accumulated euros on the conviction that the currency was overdue for a big climb back. But since that has not happened, those fund managers are now under increasing pressure to sell their euros at the first opportunity.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Duisenberg's insistence that the central bank was not intervening in markets, many traders were convinced that it did want to send the markets a signal. For one thing, it was the first time that the bank had sold money it earned from foreign investments. Beyond that, the bank took the somewhat unusual step of announcing the move in a written statement.</p>
        <p>At a news conference today after a meeting of the central bank's governing council, Mr. Duisenberg insisted that the move was not an ''intervention'' but said that he was ''not disappointed'' when the euro climbed briefly in response.</p>
        <p>Once heavily criticized for suggesting that he practiced ''benign neglect'' of the euro's exchange rate, Mr. Duisenberg went out of his way to declare his unhappiness about the currency's value and his conviction that it would eventually bounce back.</p>
        <p>He noted that economic growth in the euro zone is running well above 3 percent this year, that business confidence is at record levels and that inflation in the European region is among the lowest in the world.</p>
        <p>''The fact that the euro has continue to depreciate over recent months is not in line with these economic fundamentals,'' Mr. Duisenberg said. ''Our concerns on this issue remain serious and we shall monitor developments closely.''</p>
