        <p>Even after a year, the emotional scars from Tropical Storm Floyd's ravaging flash floods are still so raw that a routine rainstorm frightens some people here.</p>
        <p>On a recent Saturday, Ernest Lukacs, 70, and his wife, Gertrude, 66, had planned a trip to the movies. But it rained, so they stayed home.</p>
        <p>''We were leery,'' Mr. Lukacs said. ''Do we go to the movies and not get home or do we stay and watch our house? I wanted to be here just in case.''</p>
        <p>Their grandson, also nervous, called about 11:30 p.m. and said he would check the level of the Millstone River about 400 yards from their home in this central New Jersey town.</p>
        <p>''That's not a way to live,'' Mrs. Lukacs said.</p>
        <p>So they plan a major change in their lives soon, taking the federal government up on its offer to buy and demolish the little Cape Cod they have lived in  since 1968 -- and in which they have endured four floods.</p>
        <p>The federal program -- a $6.2 million buyout of 42 homes in an isolated, often-flooded neighborhood of Manville called Lost Valley -- is the largest single response to Floyd in the New York metropolitan region, which has spent the year recovering and rebuilding.</p>
        <p>Communities have restored their flood-damaged roads and bridges in central and northern New Jersey and Rockland and Westchester Counties in New York. And officials in towns hit hardest by Floyd say they have improved their flood-emergency planning for evacuating, sheltering and feeding victims.</p>
        <p>Yet despite these efforts, flood-prone towns, particularly in New Jersey, remain flood-prone. The two New Jersey towns that suffered some of the state's worst damage from Floyd -- Bound Brook, where two people drowned in the storm, and Lodi, where one drowned -- remain as vulnerable as they were a year ago.</p>
        <p>In late August, the National Weather Service warned the metropolitan region and much of the  Northeast about flood risks because of a rainy summer, brimming lakes and reservoirs, high-rising rivers and saturated woodlands and fields less capable of absorbing ground water than in drier summers. The risk has eased somewhat in the last two weeks, the weather service says, but the warning is still in effect.</p>
        <p>And while municipal and state officials in New Jersey say they are comfortable with their revised flood-response plans, they caution that not much has changed to prevent another flood, big or small, in the coming weeks of this hurricane season.</p>
        <p>''How do you get prepared for a flood?'' asked Bound Brook's mayor, Frank Ryan. ''We're smarter. We're always tuned in on the weather. We monitor river levels. But we don't control the Raritan River.''</p>
        <p>Help is finally coming to Bound Brook. A $330 million flood control project is emerging from about 20 years of political squabbling and worries about federal money. The project, designed by the Army Corps of Engineers in the late 1970's, involves 14 miles of flood walls and levees in Bound Brook and 12 other towns in the Raritan River basin in Middlesex, Somerset and Union Counties. Construction of the Bound Brook section is scheduled to start this fall and last through 2004. The entire project is expected to take a decade to complete.</p>
        <p>For the immediate future, Bound Brook and its neighboring communities, including Manville, are at the mercy of the rivers and weather.</p>
        <p>Richard and Linda Ferguson, who live one street over from the Lukacses in Manville and have also signed up for the buyout, have been flooded three times since they moved here in 1992. Each time, the water crept a little higher, until it filled six feet of their first floor last Sept. 16, the night that Floyd swept through the region, killing five people in New Jersey, overflowing rivers and flooding thousands of homes and businesses in New Jersey and New York.</p>
        <p>Now, if a downpour lasts a day, Mr. Ferguson, a 36-year-old police officer, walks down by the Millstone to see if water is spilling into adjacent ball fields, the first sign of a possible flood. ''At night when it rains, you can't sleep,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To the north, in Bergen County, Lodi, too, remains exposed. ''There's nothing we can do to prevent a recurrence on our own,'' said the town manager, Stephen Lo Iacono.</p>
        <p>For years, he said, Lodi has appealed for the dredging and widening of the Saddle River, which routinely spills into downtown Lodi in hard rains. He said the Army Corps of Engineers had talked about the dredging -- to deepen the river channel, allowing it to carry more water -- periodically since the 1930's.</p>
        <p>''But there's no money,'' he said. ''Money is always at the root of so many problems. We suffered unbelievably in Floyd. It'll be quite some time before we recover.''</p>
        <p>In the little neighboring town of Rochelle Park, officials now talk of wrangling with state bureaucrats for a permit to dredge a skimpy creek called Sprout Brook. During Floyd, it flooded the adjacent town hall and scores of nearby homes. Without the dredging, Rochelle Park would be helpless if another storm of Floyd's magnitude hit, said the town administrator, Joseph Manzella. ''There's really nothing we've done to stop it from happening again,'' he said. ''What can we do, move people out?  We had 500 homes damaged.''</p>
        <p>The town wants several miles of Sprout Brook dredged, from Paramus south to the Saddle River. A state permit for a project that long requires a design document that would cost $20,000, Mr. Manzella said. The town has an old dredging design plan drafted in 1977, when the brook last flooded. But the state will allow use of the 1977 design only for 500 feet of dredging, Mr. Manzella said.</p>
        <p>''Five hundred feet is not going to help us,'' he said. ''Trying to get the permit has been a long, drawn-out red-tape deal -- a Catch-22, really.''</p>
        <p>In Rockland County, N.Y., which was also hard hit, the county government has begun a flood control project on its own. Weeks after Floyd, it expanded the staff of its drainage agency, a flood control unit, to 19 people from 3. It has also set aside about $13 million to clear debris from streams that flooded in Haverstraw, Stony Point and Clarks town and to restore sections of their washed-out banks with retaining walls and large rocks, or riprap.</p>
        <p>''We've designed these projects to withstand another Floyd,'' said the director of the drainage agency, Edward Devine.</p>
        <p>The county has also asked the State Legislature to broaden a 1976 law enacted specifically for Rockland, allowing it to regulate new development along 80 miles of streams in the county. The county now wants that authority extended to the 400 or so miles of streams not under county jurisdiction, Mr. Devine said.</p>
        <p>While the federal buyout in the Lost Valley neighborhood of Manville is the region's biggest response to Floyd, the 42 homes are only a small fraction of those whose occupants wanted to leave its flood zone.  Rivers and creeks border the neighborhood on the east, south and west.  Railroad tracks run along its northern edge.</p>
        <p>It is an unhurried place, with little outward sign of last September's flood, save abandoned houses here and there. Most homes have been rebuilt, and lawns and flower beds are bright with color. But the image belies a weariness and fear.</p>
        <p>Lost Valley, so named because of its inaccessibility, has 524 Cape Cods and ranch homes, most assessed at $100,000 to $150,000, Mayor Angelo Corradino said.</p>
        <p>Owners of 500 homes applied for the buyout, and town officials selected 274 of them for the program, he said. Then the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is overseeing the buyout and financing 75 percent of its cost, reduced the number to 42 by qualifying only those that were most vulnerable to floods and had suffered the worst damage in last year's storm, officials said. The 42 homes were the only ones that satisfied a FEMA rule that future potential flood damage would be more costly than buying the house.</p>
        <p>(The buyout program also provides an additional $2.5 million for 34 homes flooded in Trenton and $965,000 for three flood-prone properties in Branchburg.)</p>
        <p>Many of the eligible homeowners in Lost Valley seem wistful about leaving, but eager to go. Sybil and Stephen Toth are leaving their home of 27 years. ''I don't think I could take another flood,'' Mrs. Toth, 59, said. ''You don't know when it's going to happen again.''</p>
        <p>Mina and John Mills, residents since 1968, are ready to leave for the Poconos after four floods. Their three children, who fished the Millstone in summer and skated on it in the winter, are all grown.</p>
        <p>''This was a nice place to raise kids,'' she said. ''It's a sad thing to leave. The people are great. Someone's always there for you. But we're just afraid it's going to happen again.''</p>
