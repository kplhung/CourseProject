        <p>Although most New Yorkers approve of the job the Police Department is doing and are optimistic that crime in the city will continue to decline, a strong majority of residents also think that the department cannot effectively police itself and needs an independent monitor, according to the results of a poll commissioned by the City Council.</p>
        <p>The results, to be released today, offer a detailed view of the city's paradoxical relationship with its police force, suggesting that residents unequivocally appreciate the department's role in rolling back crime but are suspicious of its tactics, its attitudes and its commitment to disciplining brutal or corrupt officers.</p>

        <p>Although most New Yorkers approve of the job the Police Department is doing and are optimistic that crime in the city will continue to decline, a strong majority of residents also think that the department cannot effectively police itself and needs an independent monitor, according to the results of a poll commissioned by the City Council.</p>
        <p>The results, to be released today, offer a detailed view of the city's paradoxical relationship with its police force, suggesting that residents unequivocally appreciate the department's role in rolling back crime but are suspicious of its tactics, its attitudes and its commitment to disciplining brutal or corrupt officers.</p>
        <p>The poll also found that the department had significantly greater support from white residents than from blacks or Hispanics, many of whom reported being afraid or concerned when approached by the police.</p>
        <p>For example, 51 percent of white New Yorkers said they believed the department engaged in racial profiling, compared with 79 percent of blacks and 66 percent of Hispanics.</p>
        <p>Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, said the survey confirmed a common impression of the department as an agency that has excelled in fighting crime, but has alienateed many of the citizens it serves.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, the dropping crime rate in the city of New York is phenomenal, it's internationally known, but we think a lot more can be done,'' Mr. Vallone said. ''There are some serious perceptions and realities that have to be handled.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone said, for instance, that he was cheered that 61 percent of all New Yorkers thought the department had done a good or excellent job, but was saddened by survey results showing that 42 percent of blacks and 36 percent of Hispanics said that they would feel ''fearful'' or ''somewhat concerned'' when seeing a police officer walk toward them.</p>
        <p>''That's something I'm sorry to see, that people have this fear, that people are frightened when they see the police,'' he said. ''That's one finding I wish we didn't find.''</p>
        <p>The survey also suggested that the department's Courtesy, Professionalism and Respect program, created in 1997 by Police Commissioner Howard Safir, had not achieved its desired effect of improving the department's image. Only 47 percent of those surveyed thought officers treated the public with courtesy, professionalism and respect most of the time. Moreover, only 15 percent of residents said they were personally acquainted with any of the officers who patrolled their neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Deputy Chief Thomas P. Fahey, a spokesman for the Police Department, said yesterday that the new police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, had not yet received a copy of the survey and its results, and would not comment until he had.</p>
        <p>The survey was conducted by McGuire Research Services, which called 1,500 residents from July 31 to Aug. 7. Each resident was asked 35 questions in a standardized interview. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, said Traci A. Nagy, regional vice president of the company. The pollsters sought to get a representative sample of the city based on ethnicity and geography.</p>
        <p>The survey's results arrive at a crucial time for the Police Department. Mr. Kerik is completing his first month in command of the 40,000-member force, and has said he wants to strengthen the department's relationship with residents.</p>
        <p>The department also faces the prospect of independent oversight.</p>
        <p>For more than a year, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration has been negotiating with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, who are seeking a federal monitor to oversee the department. The prosecutors' recommendation is the result of an investigation of the department's disciplinary procedures that followed the torture of Abner Louima in a Brooklyn station house in 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has also resisted the City Council's effort to create an Independent Police Investigation and Audit Board; that matter is in court. In both cases, Mr. Giuliani has said that the department is already policed by the Civilian Complaint Review Board and the department's own Internal Affairs Bureau. Any additional oversight, the mayor has said, would be redundant.</p>
        <p>According to the survey, an overwhelming majority of New Yorkers think that an independent group should oversee the department. That view was expressed by 70 percent of whites, 80 percent of Hispanics and 85 percent of blacks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone said that the survey's finding of public support for an oversight board provided the City Council and Mr. Giuliani with an opportunity to create a city-run monitor before the federal government appointed its own. He called on the mayor to do so before leaving office.</p>
        <p>He said a city-run monitor would be ''a wonderful way of knocking off the perception by a large portion of your population that somehow the Police Department are not public servants working for them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's office referred questions about the poll to Steven M. Fishner, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator. Although Mr. Fishner acknowledged that the survey sent a mixed message to the department, he said much of it was rooted merely in perceptions, and the survey's greatest value was in its overall conclusion. He said, for instance, that the survey showed that 80 percent of all New Yorkers thought the department had done an excellent, good or fair job, a result he called ''a vote of confidence by the city of New York.''</p>
        <p>''The most important conclusion is the overall conclusion, which is that 8 in 10 New Yorkers approve of the job the Police Department is doing,'' Mr. Fishner said.</p>
        <p>He said this approval was rooted in facts: that crime had declined 55 percent since 1993, the year Mr. Giuliani was first elected, and that homicides had declined 65 percent. In recent years, the number of intentional shootings by police officers has plummeted, and civilian complaints have also declined.</p>
        <p>''Perceptions are of some interest,'' Mr. Fishner said of the survey. ''But perceptions are not reality. For reality, you need the objective facts.''</p>
