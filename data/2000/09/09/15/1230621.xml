        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Membership Has Its Privileges,'' by Frank Rich (column, Sept. 9), may have been directed toward the character of Gov. George W. Bush, but he should not be faulted for his fortune of birth. The problem is the whole system by which campaigns are financed.</p>
        <p>The uncertainties of political life and the staggering costs of viable political campaigns tend to eliminate those of lesser means. Those left must be either independently wealthy or beholden to the special interests of contributors.</p>
        <p>''Self-made'' millionaires are too busy amassing their fortunes to garner experience as state representatives or lower elected officials. That leaves trust-fund heirs, solicitors of funds from special interests and an occasional self-made millionaire in his first elected office to populate Congress and national political offices.</p>
        <p>Campaign finance reform, anyone?</p>
