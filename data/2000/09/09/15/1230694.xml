      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Last December, Judge James A. Parker of the Federal District Court here had two crucial encounters with John Kelly, then the United States Attorney for New Mexico, in hearings in the nuclear secrets case of Wen Ho Lee.</p>
        <p>The seeds of Judge Parker's startling denunciation of the government's tactics in the case, delivered on Wednesday before Dr. Lee, a former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist, was released after pleading guilty to one count of mishandling nuclear secrets, may have been sown at those December hearings, since the judge appears to have felt he was misled during them by government officials driven by questionable motives.</p>
        <p>In the first hearing, Mr. Kelly, who had not previously appeared in the case, stood up in court and argued that if the judge agreed to release Dr. Lee to home detention on bail -- something the judge was clearly leaning toward -- the security preparations would require so much time and supervision that it would amount to the creation of a ''private jail'' at Dr. Lee's home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly's message was clear. If Judge Parker released Dr. Lee, it would form the basis of an appeal to overturn the order, something judges tend to avoid. Mr. Kelly's presence in court also made it clear that the full weight of the government would lie behind any appeal.</p>
        <p>In the second and more important encounter, Judge Parker met with the two sides in a closed hearing. According to lawyers familiar with the meeting, Mr. Kelly and a senior agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert Messemer, vigorously warned the judge that enemy intelligence agents were poised to search out and possibly obtain the nuclear secrets that Dr. Lee had improperly downloaded.</p>
        <p>They contended that if Dr. Lee, who they claimed had engaged in a series of deceptions, was released even to closely supervised home detention, the nation could suffer a catastrophic loss of strategic information.</p>
        <p>Judge Parker agreed with the government and, for nine months, the 60-year-old Dr. Lee was held under conditions reserved for the most violent, threatening defendants.</p>
        <p>For several months, the lights in his cell were kept on without pause; every one of his actions was watched. Dr. Lee has said he was underfed and constantly hungry. When he exercised -- one hour a day, five days a week -- he was shackled. For the single hour each week that he could meet with his wife and children, an officer was at his side.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Judge Parker apologized to Dr. Lee for those conditions, said he had been wrong to send him to jail and excoriated the government -- and Mr. Kelly in particular -- for misleading him into making a faulty decision.</p>
        <p>While he criticized several aspects of the government's case, Judge Parker's most acid remarks focused on the lengths to which the prosecutors had gone to keep Dr. Lee in prison. And though the judge was not specific, previous comments suggest that he felt misled to the point of betrayal by the warnings the officials issued at the closed hearing in December, the essence of which have not been previously reported.</p>
        <p>''I tell you with great sadness that I feel I was led astray last December by the executive branch of our government through the Department of Justice, by its Federal Bureau of Investigation and by the United States Attorney for the District of New Mexico, who held office at that time,'' the judge told Mr. Lee in court on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>In January, just days after the bail hearing, Mr. Kelly resigned from his office and is now running for Congress from New Mexico as a Democrat. He said in an interview on Monday that he felt the plea deal was a good result for the government.</p>
        <p>It received little attention at the time, but several weeks ago, when Judge Parker decided to release Dr. Lee on bail, he noted that the threats of enemy agents stealing the nuclear secrets Dr. Lee downloaded had proven hollow.</p>
        <p>In fact, Judge Parker asked Mr. Messemer, when he was testifying, if any big increase in enemy intelligence activity had materialized. Mr. Messemer quietly responded that it had not. During the same hearing, Mr. Messemer also acknowledged that he had provided misleading testimony in December in several other crucial issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Messemer had said, for example, that Dr. Lee lied to a colleague to gain access to a computer, then recanted. He had also said that Dr. Lee had sent letters to a number of foreign scientific institutes seeking a job, suggesting that Dr. Lee may have downloaded all the secrets in an effort to enhance his job prospects. But Mr. Messemer recanted again, saying that the F.B.I. had no knowledge any such letters had ever been sent.</p>
        <p>Judge Parker clearly had such events in mind when he read his withering criticisms in court on Wednesday, which amounted to his judgment of the government's actions. Equally clear was his frustration that, with the criminal case closed, there would be no further opportunities, in his courtroom at least, to find out why the government had behaved in this way, or why it had singled out Dr. Lee.</p>
        <p>One of the judge's most important rulings for the defense came several weeks ago when he ordered the government to hand over to him a huge amount of classified documents so he could decide whether evidence suggested that Dr. Lee had been unfairly singled out for prosecution. The material Judge Parker ordered was due this Friday, a deadline that was lifted with the acceptance of the plea agreement.</p>
        <p>In his statement on Wednesday, Judge Parker noted that the government's sudden change of heart -- in its willingness to release Dr. Lee -- ''occurred shortly before the executive branch was to have produced, for my review in camera, a large volume of information that I previously ordered it to produce.''</p>
        <p>He said he was troubled that he did not know why the government acted so irresponsibly, and he remarked, pointedly, ''We will not learn why because the plea agreement shields the executive branch from disclosing a lot of information that it was under oath to produce that might have supplied the answer.''</p>
        <p>Judge Parker was careful to explain in his remarks the differences among the three branches of government.</p>
        <p>What he did not explain, but seemed to know others in Washington would understand, was that even though the courts no longer had the right to those government documents, it was well within the right of Congress to subpoena them. The judge's remarks were as close to an invitation and road map as Congress is likely to get.</p>
