        <p>Darryl Hamilton was healthy and feisty enough to play basketball with some teammates in an alcove of the visiting clubhouse at Olympic Stadium today. Manager Bobby Valentine listened to the thump-thumps from his office and grudgingly let the games go on.</p>
        <p>''It's not bad with the free throws; it's good for your concentration,'' Valentine said. ''H-O-R-S-E isn't bad. One on one, I'm not big on.''</p>
        <p>On the makeshift court, Hamilton can decide when he plays. Valentine determines how much time Hamilton gets on the field. Lately, Hamilton has not gotten much.</p>
        <p>''It's not my decision,'' said Hamilton, the outfielder who has played sporadically since coming back from a toe injury that cost him four months. ''I take it day by day.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton insisted today that everything is normal with his arthritic left big toe, which always causes him some pain. But Valentine has seen something different.</p>
        <p>''He hasn't complained about his toe, but when he got that hit the other night and ran to first, there was a pretty pronounced limp,'' Valentine said, referring to Hamilton's pinch-hit single on Monday. ''He seems to be swinging the bat fine, but I think it limits him a little. He has a big heart, but he's anything but pain-free.''</p>
        <p>Eight of the Mets' next 11 games are on artificial turf; four in Montreal and four next weekend in Philadelphia. Valentine said he thought Hamilton ''could give us a good game or two on turf,'' but he conceded it has been difficult to find opportunities. And when opportunities have come up, Valentine has still been reluctant.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday at Shea Stadium, Valentine gave right fielder Derek Bell a day off against a tough right-hander, Milwaukee's Jeff D'Amico. That would have been an ideal spot in which to start Hamilton, a left-handed hitter, and if Valentine believed Hamilton was 100 percent, he said he probably would have started him.</p>
        <p>''I don't like to see guys less than 100 percent, and I really don't like seeing guys who look like they're hurting playing,'' Valentine said. ''But I'm torn, because I look at matchups and Darryl always has good stats against guys we're playing. It's a tough thing to try to determine: if he's 85 percent, what is that? He's had good at-bats pinch-hitting, so that's a plus.''</p>
        <p>Valentine said it was too early to start thinking about whether Hamilton's condition would affect his status on a potential playoff roster. Hamilton has 4 hits in 11 at-bats this month, but he was out of the lineup again tonight and has started just one of the Mets' last nine games.</p>
        <p>Bullpen Gets a Rest</p>
        <p>Four of the Mets' established relievers -- Dennis Cook, Pat Mahomes, Turk Wendell and Rick White -- pitched only one game apiece during the just-completed six-game homestand. With September call-ups available to pitch in blowouts and the starting pitchers going deep in games, the middle relief corps is getting a chance to rest.</p>
        <p>''If your starters are giving you seven or eight innings every game, it's a beautiful thing,'' White said. ''Everybody stays fresh, nobody's tired, everybody's strong going into the postseason.''</p>
        <p>Cook pitched one inning and White pitched two-thirds of an inning in tonight's 10-4 victory over the Expos.</p>
        <p>It is more important for relievers to pitch regularly early in the season, White said, before they have built up arm strength and refined their mechanics. At this point, he said, those things are usually nonissues. ''You just hope you don't hit a dead arm at the end of the season,'' he said.</p>
