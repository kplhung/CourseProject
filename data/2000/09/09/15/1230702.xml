      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Even in the spike-elbowed world of political consulting, Alex Castellanos, the chief advertising architect for the Republican National Committee, stands out as a uniquely bad-boy strategist.</p>
        <p>Consider these highlights from his long resume:</p>
        <p>In 1984, at the age of 30, Mr. Castellanos produced campaign spots for Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative North Carolina Republican, that political scientists consider trend-setting in their harsh tone and ominous soundtracks.</p>
        <p>In 1990, he created for Mr. Helms what is widely viewed as one of the most racially charged political commercials ever, with white hands crumpling a job rejection letter while a narrator criticizes Mr. Helms's black opponent, Harvey Gantt, for supporting ''racial quotas.''</p>
        <p>And in 1996, Bob Dole's presidential campaign canceled commercials produced by Mr. Castellanos because campaign officials considered them overly caustic in accusing President Clinton of lying.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Castellanos's work is under sharp scrutiny again. This week, Democrats attacked the Republicans for running a commercial produced by Mr. Castellanos that fleetingly featured the word ''rats'' in large, white letters. The image was a fragment of the word ''bureaucrats'' in a commercial criticizing Vice President Al Gore's prescription drug plan.</p>
        <p>The episode created a major distraction for the party's presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who was repeatedly questioned by reporters about the spot over two days. And it nearly cost Mr. Castellanos his job. (Republican Party officials now say they believe he did not intentionally use the word, and he will continue making hard-edged commercials for them. The commercial is no longer running.)</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview this evening, a clearly agitated Mr. Castellanos again asserted that the word ''rats'' was an accident and complained that someone -- he would not say who -- was out to get him fired.</p>
        <p>''Someone's decided I need to be brushed aside, and they've put a bull's-eye on my head,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Castellanos was little known to the broader public before this week, he has long been viewed by political professionals as a master of brass-knuckles campaigning. And this week, many of those professionals said they were not surprised to hear that Mr. Castellanos was under scrutiny again.</p>
        <p>''I think he probably has less restraint than most people in this business,'' said David L. Paletz, a professor of political science at Duke University who has studied political advertisements, including those produced by Mr. Castellanos. ''It's not a profession of gentlemen. But he seems to me to be more willing to go for the jugular than most, and to slit a few other veins along the way.''</p>
        <p>A Republican strategist who worked with Mr. Castellanos on the 1996 Dole campaign said, ''He's pretty cute by half. He prides himself on that. So when I heard about this, I wasn't surprised.''</p>
        <p>Over the years, Mr. Castellanos has defended the value of attack advertising, once saying, ''The truest spots, most factual spots, are the negative and comparative.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, he again defended advertisements that draw sharp contrasts, saying, ''At the end of the day we have an obligation to let voters know the differences.'' He added, ''If I can help people understand that, it's a good day for me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Castellanos came to America when he was 6 years old when his family fled Cuba and settled in North Carolina. He often tells people that his conservatism and dislike of government regulation are rooted in his experiences growing up in a Communist country. ''He came to this country as a political refugee who understands how precious freedom is,'' said Paul Taylor, executive director of the Alliance for Better Campaigns, a nonprofit group that enlisted Mr. Castellanos in 1998 to help produce an advertisement encouraging voter participation. After graduating from the University of North Carolina, Mr. Castellanos came under the tutelage of Arthur Finkelstein, a prominent New York media consultant known for hard-hitting campaigns, who recruited Mr. Castellanos to work on campaigns for Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Mr. Helms and other conservative politicians.</p>
        <p>Working with Michael Murphy, another young strategist, Mr. Castellanos produced commercials for Mr. Helms in his 1984 re-election campaign against Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina that political scientists say pioneered attack techniques for a new generation of consultants. Among the the techniques: using dark colors, harsh sounds, sinister music and strong words, particularly ''liar,'' to paint a threatening picture of an opponent.</p>
        <p>''He was a leader in what I called hard-sell negative advertising,'' said Montague Kern, a journalism professor at Rutgers University who devoted a chapter in her 1989 book, ''30-Second Politics,'' to the Hunt-Helms race. ''There was a time in the 1970's when people thought negative campaigning didn't work. The 1984 Helms-Hunt race disproved that.''</p>
        <p>After helping on Vice President George Bush's 1988 presidential campaign, Mr. Castellanos returned to Mr. Helm's payroll in 1990 and 1996.</p>
        <p>But early in the 1996 campaign, Mr. Helms released Mr. Castellanos and pulled one of his spots off the air after a Democratic candidate, Charlie Sanders, challenged its veracity. The advertisement had accused the Democrat of supporting affirmative action and gay rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Castellanos said that he was fired because he opposed attacking Mr. Sanders. And he defended the advertisement's accuracy. ''I fight hard but I fight fair,'' he said. ''And sometimes I've lost because of it.''</p>
        <p>That would not be the last time a Castellanos commercial would be canceled by one of his bosses. In Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, Mr. Castellanos produced a spot late in the race in which a female narrator said of Mr. Clinton, ''I lied, raised your taxes and got caught.'' Mr. Dole and some of his aides considered the advertisement disrespectful of the presidency, so they killed it and turned to another producer for a more positive spot, a Dole adviser said.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Bob Taft's campaign for Ohio governor pulled an advertisement produced by Mr. Castellanos after the Ohio Elections Commission determined it had falsely accused the Democratic candidate of cutting crime-fighting employees while serving as state attorney general. It was the first time the commission had reprimanded a candidate for governor for violating election laws.</p>
        <p>Three weeks ago, Mr. Bush intervened to kill a Republican Party advertisement developed by Mr. Castellanos because he thought the spot used misleading quotes to attack Mr. Gore's credibility.</p>
        <p>His peers often praise Mr. Castellanos for the visual and audio sophistication of his advertisements. And that sophistication has caused some critics to question whether he tries to play tricks on audiences.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mr. Castellanos devised a commercial for Senator Lauch Faircloth, Republican of North Carolina, that attacked the Democratic candidate, John Edwards, for being a high-paid trial lawyer.</p>
        <p>In a version of the commercial that was recorded off the television by the Edwards campaign and provided to The New York Times by Democratic officials, a woman's voice can be barely heard in the background saying, as if on a telephone answering machine: ''Valerie? It's mom. Are you all right?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Edward's most famous case involved a young girl named Valerie Lakey who was seriously injured after being trapped on a swimming pool drain. The Edwards campaign took the tape to a television station, only to find that its version of the commercial lacked the background voice. So they dropped the issue.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Mr. Castellanos suggested that the Democrats had doctored the video, saying, ''I have never made a spot with anything like that.''</p>
        <p>Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, said that Mr. Castellanos used a technique she called ''priming'' in his 1990 ''white hands'' commercial to incite racial fears.</p>
        <p>In the spot, the job rejection letter has a black mark in the margin that viewers in a focus group Ms. Jamieson conducted interpreted as a black hand, she said. Ms. Jamieson said her analysis of the 1990 advertisement has led her to conclude that Mr. Castellanos purposely inserted the word ''rats'' into his recent spot. ''He's done it before,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Castellanos replied, ''Kathleen Hall Jamieson, bless her sweet heart, is overanalyzing.''</p>
