        <p>'The Last Years'</p>
        <p>Robert Miller</p>
        <p>524 West 26th Street, Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through Oct. 14</p>
        <p>For Alice Neel fans who found her Whitney Museum retrospective too small, here's more: 33 paintings from her last five years (she died in 1984) plus a small, delightful drawing retrospective.</p>
        <p>Neel was still going strong as an octogenarian. She was not what you would call a painter's painter, but her prehensile line brusquely filled in with bold color gave people on canvas a vitality few late-20th-century portraitists have matched.</p>
        <p>Some of the most arresting pictures in this show are of children, to whom it seems Neel felt more intimately connected yet whom she felt freer to transform. The two rubbery bald toddlers in ''Evans Twins'' or the ghoulish Jonathan in the arms of his father, Don Perlis, seem imbued with demonic energy; girls in fancy dresses radiate awkward eagerness; dark-eyed teenagers smolder. Neel herself had a wide childlike streak; perhaps her pictures of children are as much projections of her own rambunctious inner child as responses to actual small human beings. By contrast, her official portrait of Mayor Koch is emptily dutiful.</p>
        <p>The 15 drawings, dated from 1936 to 1975, make a fine show-within-a-show. Approaches range from a smoothly penciled profile of ''Sam'' (1941) to the densely hatched ''Phil'' (1951) to a highly abbreviated 1970 study for the famous portrait of Andy Warhol. Drawing was always Neel's strong suit and it is good to see it on its own. It argues persuasively for a more extensive show of drawings by this wonderfully humane artist.</p>
