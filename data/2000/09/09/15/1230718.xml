        <p>Vice President Al Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, headlined a star-spangled musical benefit for their party last night, highlighting a spree of copious fund-raising that Republicans said undercut this week's Democratic crusade against the entertainment industry's marketing practices.</p>
        <p>The event at Radio City Music Hall, which featured some of popular music's best-known names, raised $6.5 million for the Democratic National Committee. But because it was organized by three top entertainment executives, including Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax Films, the Democratic bounty was not gathered without some political cost.</p>
        <p>Four hours before the concert began with a song by the rock star Sheryl Crow, the Republican national chairman, Jim Nicholson, stood outside the concert hall and accused the Democrats of hypocrisy. Earlier in the day, Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, used strong language to make a similar point.</p>
        <p>''I hope America gets to see all the inconsistencies of how this man is conducting his campaign and what he's telling the people,'' Mr. Bush said in an interview with a Fox TV affiliate in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Even David Letterman got in on the act. In his monologue, before interviewing Mr. Gore on the CBS ''Late Show,'' Mr. Letterman told audience members that the program would double as ''a special Al Gore fund-raiser'' and warned that Mr. Gore ''will be out here a little bit later to collect your $1,000.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nicholson said it was disingenuous to take the entertainment industry's money only days after Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman strongly criticized it for marketing violent films, recordings and video games to children, a charge leveled in a Federal Trade Commission report this week.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore says he stands with the people against the powerful,'' Mr. Nicholson said. ''There are few more powerful special interest groups in this country than the entertainment industry. But with whom does he stand tonight: the parents whose young kids are having their minds polluted and their souls corrupted by Hollywood, or the powerful Hollywood elite who put money in his pocket?''</p>
        <p>Gore aides and spokesmen for the entertainment executives emphasized that Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman had criticized only the industry's marketing techniques, not the content of its products. Furthermore, said Jennifer Backus, a Democratic National Committee spokeswoman, ''Al Gore and Joe Lieberman aren't afraid to tell their friends that they disagree with them.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Gore confronted the issue directly in his remarks at the concert, where he received heavy applause as he was introduced.</p>
        <p>''It's wrong to market inappropriate material to children,'' he said.  ''We believe in this strongly.''</p>
        <p>The lines drew light applause.</p>
        <p>The Radio City concert was the capstone of a remarkable period of concentrated fund-raising by the Democrats, who believe the political landscape now favors their presidential ticket on every level but one: money. The need to collect millions in a hurry has played a dominant role in the Gore-Lieberman campaign's scheduling in recent weeks as the two candidates, both together and apart, have attended major fund-raisers virtually every day.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, for instance, the two Democrats spent the afternoon and evening in Massachusetts, a state they are heavily favored to win, so they could attend a fund-raiser in Boston that raised nearly $2 million. As he thanked the donors for their gifts, Mr. Gore told them he supported campaign finance reform.</p>
        <p>This week alone, Mr. Gore has attended fund-raising concerts in Camden, N.J., Boston and New York City that are expected to bring in more than $9 million for his party. Mr. Lieberman has attended two of those events and others on his own that should raise more than $4 million, Ms. Backus said.</p>
        <p>Next week, Mr. Gore will mine California, first at a party fund-raiser in Los Angeles on Monday that is expected to collect close to $3 million, most of it from entertainment industry sources. Among those organizing that event are Rob Reiner, the actor and director; Haim Saban, a producer of children's television shows; and Alan Horn, president and chief operating officer of Warner Brothers. On Tuesday, Mr. Gore will head north to Silicon Valley for an event that should garner $1 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reiner and an aide to Mr. Weinstein said there had been no problem raising money for the events in New York and Los Angeles, despite the Democrats' comments about the entertainment industry.</p>
        <p>''Not at all,'' Mr. Reiner said. ''The people out here in Hollywood have much broader interests than their own parochial interests.''</p>
        <p>Because of his involvement in questionable Clinton administration fund-raising practices, most notably his 1996 visit to a Buddhist temple in California where money was raised illegally, Mr. Gore is viewed as vulnerable on campaign financing.</p>
        <p>''He'll say things that the public wants to hear,'' Mr. Bush said in the television interview, ''and then do things that don't match his message, whether it's the Buddhist temple or saying that he's for campaign finance reform and then accepting thousands of dollars in soft money.''</p>
        <p>Last night's concert, attended by 6,000 people, was produced by Mr. Weinstein, Jann Wenner, the publisher and editor in chief of Rolling Stone magazine, and John Sykes, the president of VH1 and Country Music TV. In addition to Ms. Crow, it featured performances by Lenny Kravitz, Jon Bon Jovi, K.D. Lang, Jimmy Buffett, Bette Midler, Paul Simon and the former Eagles Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Timothy B. Schmit.</p>
        <p>Awash in the large, unregulated contributions known as soft money, both parties have scrambled in recent weeks to raise the ''hard money'' that comes from individuals in checks of $20,000 or less.</p>
        <p>By July 1, the Democratic and Republican national committees and the parties' Congressional campaign committees had raised more than $500 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. To spend that money, the committees need to raise a considerable amount of hard money. Under Federal Election Commission rules, the parties must raise $1 of hard money for each $2 of soft money they spend.</p>
        <p>Last July, Peter S. Knight, deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee and one of Mr. Gore's chief fund-raisers, assembled the party's top financial officials at the campaign's headquarters in Nashville and told them they had to raise $25 million in hard money by the end of September to support Mr. Gore's candidacy. The fund-raisers thought the task was nearly impossible.</p>
        <p>But every Democratic fund-raising event since the party's August convention has been oversubscribed, one Democratic fund-raiser said. And Ms. Backus said last night's concert could set a party record for raising hard money.</p>
        <p>In His Own Words</p>
        <p>AL GORE  Remarks yesterday at Parkside Middle School in Manchester, N.H.:</p>
        <p>''So that's my comprehensive education plan to strengthen accountability and test all new teachers to make all our classrooms havens of learning, discipline and respect, to help middle-class families afford college and job training for a lifetime of greater learning and greater earning. It all fits within a balanced budget that pays down our national debt every single year, a budget that also enables us to cut taxes for the middle class, not just to help with college and job training but help pay for health care, child care and long-term care.</p>
        <p>But I want to say this very plainly. I will not go along with a massive tax cut that would comfort the wealthy and shortchange education. I will not go along with something that gives the most to those who need it the least. ''</p>
