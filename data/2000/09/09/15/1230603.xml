        <p>Who says plays don't pay?</p>
        <p>Continuing a winning streak from last year, when the plays ''Copenhagen,'' ''Dirty Blonde,'' and ''True West'' all did big business, two new dramatic entries were ringing up impressive numbers at the box office.</p>
        <p>The first was the Off Broadway production of ''The Unexpected Man,'' at the Promenade Theater. The play, by Yasmina Reza, author of the Broadway hit ''Art,'' racked up some $55,000 on Monday, its first full day of sales. Tuesday's take was $63,000. By Wednesday the daily tally topped $75,000, all before the show has run a single advertisement.</p>
        <p>All of which left the show's producers as happy -- and bewildered -- as lottery winners. ''If I could tell you with confidence why these things happen,'' said Ben Sprecher, one of the producers, ''I would only produce shows where this happens.''</p>
        <p>The hot ticket could be attributed to the popularity of ''Art,'' or to the appeal of the play's two stars, Eileen Atkins and Alan Bates, who play strangers on a train. Whatever the reason, the early take will surely help mitigate some of the expense from the production's elaborate design, which includes some four tons of gravel and a suspended glass floor. The sales will also probably fan speculation that ''Man'' might jump to Broadway if the 399-seat Promenade proves too small to accommodate audiences.</p>
        <p>''Man'' wasn't the only play that got out of the gate quickly this week. ''The Dinner Party,'' the new comedy from Neil Simon, also has posted impressive early sales, taking in more than $100,000 on Monday. It joins two other Broadway plays with good to great sales: ''The Best Man,'' whose producers say it has a $1.2 million advance, and ''The Tale of the Allergist's Wife,'' which is nearing the $2 million mark.</p>
        <p>Mind you, none of the productions -- except ''Tale,'' which had an acclaimed Off Broadway run last spring -- have met the New York critics, and advances can evaporate as quickly as they came, if new sales don't materialize to refill the till.</p>
        <p>Thing 1 and Thing 2</p>
        <p>Revisions of the forthcoming Broadway musical ''Seussical'' were under way in Boston this week, with a wide range of tweaks and structural changes, primarily in the second act and primarily to clarify the musical's story.</p>
        <p>Barry Weissler, one of the show's producers, said revamping was commonplace for a new musical. ''I've never done a show out of town that didn't require changes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said the changes were being mulled well before Boston critics gave the show mixed notices last week. Two of next week's performances were canceled to allow time for rehearsal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weissler dismissed rumors that David Shiner, who plays the Cat in the Hat, would be replaced, though he said some of Mr. Shiner's blocking had been altered to jell with the show's overall tone. ''David brings an edge to the show,'' Mr. Weissler said, ''and a certain artistic danger.''</p>
        <p>'I'm a Big Girl'</p>
        <p>When producers first began to call Rosie Perez several years ago to offer her roles onstage, her reaction wasn't exactly what they expected.</p>
        <p>''No way,'' she said. ''I felt I was nowhere near ready.''</p>
        <p>But last spring George C. Wolfe, the artistic director of the Public Theater, found a part for which he felt Mr. Perez might be perfect. His only worry was it might be ''too weird'' for her. Again her response was something of a surprise.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Don't insult my intelligence, George,' '' Ms. Perez recalled, with a laugh. ''I'm a big girl.''</p>
        <p>So it is that Ms. Perez will appear next spring in the premiere of ''References to Salvador Dali Make Me Hot,'' a surreal-sounding play by Jose Rivera that features actors in the characters of the moon and a coyote. Ms. Perez will play an unhappy wife opposite John Ortiz, the rising actor who will also be seen this fall in ''Jesus Hopped the A Train.'' (See below.) Performances for ''Dali'' are to begin in March.</p>
        <p>Ms. Perez, 36, a Brooklyn native whose only other New York stage experience was a short stint in ''The Vagina Monologues,'' said she was still nervous about her debut. But she added that acting in New York was what she wanted to do.</p>
        <p>''I tried to do L.A., but I have too little patience,'' she said, ''and too much attitude.''</p>
        <p>Hooray for Hollywood</p>
        <p>A couple of Off Off Broadway companies are learning how nice it can be to have well-known, and well-connected, friends.</p>
        <p>The first is the Melting Pot theater, which confirmed this week that its production of ''Cobb,'' the 1989 Lee Blessing drama about Ty Cobb, would move to a commercial run at the Lucille Lortel Theater in Greenwich Village. Performances begin in late October.</p>
        <p>The move is being financed largely by Kevin Spacey, who saw the show last May, then paid for a two-week extension for the production and urged other producers to take a look. He had originally come to see ''Cobb'' because it starred Matthew Mabe, who was an understudy last year in ''The Iceman Cometh,'' in which Mr. Spacey played the central role.</p>
        <p>Across town the Labyrinth Theater Company was also preparing for its first commercial transfer: ''Jesus Hopped the A Train,'' the prison drama by Stephen Adly Guirgis about a pair of Rikers Island thugs.</p>
        <p>The production had a short run over the summer but has since been optioned by two commercial producers, Ron Kastner and Roy Gabay, who have a professional connection to the show's director, Philip Seymour Hoffman. Mr. Kastner was the lead producer of last spring's runaway hit ''True West,'' in which Mr. Hoffman received a Tony nomination for his performance. Mr. Gabay was that show's general manager.</p>
        <p>The commercial run is to begin previews on Nov. 21 and open a week later at the East 13th Street Theater in the East Village, better known as the home of the Classic Stage Company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoffman, 33, joined Labyrinth about five years ago after doing a production of ''The Merchant of Venice'' with Mr. Ortiz in Chicago. Last year he directed ''In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings,'' also by Mr. Guirgis.</p>
        <p>''I think his writing has gotten a lot stronger,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''And as he matures, I think the whole company matures. And I think it's a great kind of evolution.''</p>
