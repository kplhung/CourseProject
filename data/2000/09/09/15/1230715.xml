        <p>A judge ordered Buffalo's public school teachers back to their classrooms yesterday after they announced a strike in the hour before school started for the second time in a weeklong and increasingly bitter dispute.</p>
        <p>The roughly 4,000 teachers in the Buffalo school system, the state's second largest, had returned to classes earlier this week as a good-faith gesture while strike negotiations continued, and the school district believed that the two sides were within whispering distance of a settlement late Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>But after hundreds of students had already boarded the buses to school, the Buffalo Teachers Federation announced at 7 yesterday morning that it would strike again; the same timing it used last Sept. 7, when administrators scrambled to cancel school after the day had effectively begun for the district's 47,000 students.</p>
        <p>Bus drivers served their routes as usual yesterday to tell parents waiting with their children at bus stops that school was canceled, and to pick up any children waiting alone to deliver them to school, where officials called parents.</p>
        <p>''For the teachers' union to make this decision after the children were on the buses, and without any warning, it's just, it's just unbelievable,'' said Marion Canedo, the schools superintendent and herself a picket-line veteran of a bitter teachers' strike in 1976. ''The distance we were apart was so small; I don't have words to describe this.''</p>
        <p>Justice Kevin M. Dillon ordered union officials into State Supreme Court at midday, then issued a restraining order requiring the teachers to return to work and the union to return to court on Monday, when he would hold a contempt hearing. The judge, who said he grew up in a union family, blasted the union leaders.</p>
        <p>''As a father,'' he said, ''I ask how would a Pepsi-Cola worker on Walden Avenue feel dropping off a child at the bus stop at 7 in the morning and getting out to work, only to discover the strike had started?''</p>
        <p>There have been relatively few teachers' strikes in New York State over the last two decades, largely because of the Taylor Law, which makes it illegal for public employees to strike. But even for Buffalo, a city with a long history of lawsuits and strikes by the teachers' union, this dispute has become particularly fierce, with the city's mayor yesterday accusing the union of ''unconscionable and selfish'' behavior and the union accusing school officials of reneging on salary offers made at the negotiating table.</p>
        <p>''In the interests of our community and at the request of the state mediator, Buffalo teachers have gone more than the extra mile to keep schools open,'' the union said in a statement. ''Because of the broken assurances of the district and their apparent lack of authority to negotiate, we have no choice but to request that Buffalo teachers picket in the Buffalo public schools.''</p>
        <p>Superintendent Canedo vehemently denied pulling back any proposals. ''There is nothing, never, ever, that has been reneged on,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The union has been working under an expired contract since June 1999. The primary dispute in negotiations is over salary increases. But according to the district, the two sides were a mere half percentage point apart Wednesday night, with the district offering a 16.5 percent pay raise over four years, and the teachers pushing for a 17 percent increase.</p>
        <p>In addition, the district is asking teachers to accept a reduction in retirement benefits. Buffalo schools now provide retiring teachers with lifetime health insurance, at an annual expense of $10.3 million, but that cost is expected to double over the next five years.</p>
        <p>Andrew Maddigan, a spokesman for the district, said the district was now asking teachers to assume part of those costs, by paying $675 a year after retirement for health insurance for the first four years of a new contract, and $1,000 a year after that.</p>
        <p>But teachers also object to a provision that would allow the district to hire outside social workers to work with children. The union wants the district to use school social workers and psychologists, who are union members, but the school district said those people are overwhelmed dealing with the city's special education students, who make up 26 percent of all students in the district's 80 schools.</p>
        <p>Mayor Anthony Masiello, who has two children in the schools, accused the union of striking over petty differences; the last major strike, in 1976, was over sweeping layoffs and budget cuts.</p>
        <p>''People expect negotiations to be bumpy and difficult, but to take the kind of action they have is totally inappropriate and uncalled for,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Teachers risk being cited for contempt of court, which could involve fines or jail time. In addition, school district officials said, the district now stands at risk of losing $2 million in state aid for the two strike days.</p>
        <p>The district must hold 180 school days as a condition of receiving state aid, but according to a contract provision that is not subject to change, Buffalo teachers cannot work more than 42 weeks past Labor Day. With several snow days likely, school officials said, they may not be able to squeeze in those 180 days before the teachers' clock runs out.</p>
