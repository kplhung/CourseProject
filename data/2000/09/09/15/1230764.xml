        <p>Wide receiver Tim Dwight of the Atlanta Falcons had to undergo an emergency appendectomy yesterday in Flowery Branch, Ga..</p>
        <p>Dwight, also a kick return specialist, will be sidelined for two to four weeks. The procedure was done with a laparoscope, which shortens recovery time considerably.</p>
        <p>Coach Dan Reeves said the rookie Darrick Vaughn would replace Dwight on the kickoff return team and Winslow Oliver would do so on the punt return team. Eugene Baker will be activated to replace Dwight at wide receiver. (AP)</p>
        <p>COWBOYS DROP KEVIN SMITH: Cornerback Kevin Smith, who earned three Super Bowl rings with Dallas, was released by the Cowboys yesterday.</p>
        <p>Smith spent the first three weeks of training camp with the Cowboys before leaving to contemplate his retirement. He was put on the reserve-retired list Aug. 22, before the start of the regular season.</p>
        <p>The eight-year veteran, a first-round draft pick in 1992 from Texas A&amp;M, had battled injuries for the last few years, including a congenital degenerative disk in his back that plagued him in the Cowboys' last two seasons. (AP)</p>
        <p>CHARGERS BENCH LEAF: The San Diego Chargers have benched quarterback Ryan Leaf for Sunday's game against Kansas City and named Moses Moreno to replace him.</p>
        <p>Leaf started the Chargers' first two games, losses to Oakland and New Orleans, completing 19 of 63 passes and throwing five interceptions. He missed the entire 1999 season after surgery to repair torn cartilage in his throwing shoulder.</p>
        <p>Moreno, 25, was a seventh-round draft pick for the Chicago Bears in 1998 out of Colorado State and has completed 3 of 4 passes for 20 yards this season. The other quarterback on the Chargers' roster is 36-year-old Jim Harbaugh, who started 12 games last season. (Bloomberg News)</p>
