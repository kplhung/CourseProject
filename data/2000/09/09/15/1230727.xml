        <p>Senior members of the London Stock Exchange's board managed to hang on to their jobs during a heated shareholder meeting that came a few days after the exchange's decision to scrap merger plans with the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt. The combination would have formed the first pan-European stock exchange. It had faced increased opposition from both retail brokers and large institutions who were uncertain how the regulations, the technology and the clearing and settlement systems of the two exchanges would meld.</p>
