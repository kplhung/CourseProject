        <p>Qing porcelain can be a neglected stepchild in the family of Chinese porcelains. Qing is the name given to porcelain produced during the Manchu Dynasty (1644-1912). The pieces were made for the imperial court, for domestic use in China and for export to the West. They differ in quantity and artistry.</p>
        <p>''The problem is that nonimperial Qing porcelains vary in quality,'' said James B. Godfrey, director of Chinese art at Sotheby's. ''There are pedestrian pieces and pieces of fine quality. It goes both ways.'' Mr. Godfrey was discussing the porcelains in Sotheby's  auction of Chinese art on Wednesday. ''The uninformed might focus on the glories of Ming,'' he said, ''but Qing imperial porcelains have always been highly sought after and reflect the highest levels of taste and appreciation.''</p>

        <p>Qing porcelain can be a neglected stepchild in the family of Chinese porcelains. Qing is the name given to porcelain produced during the Manchu Dynasty (1644-1912). The pieces were made for the imperial court, for domestic use in China and for export to the West. They differ in quantity and artistry.</p>
        <p>''The problem is that nonimperial Qing porcelains vary in quality,'' said James B. Godfrey, director of Chinese art at Sotheby's. ''There are pedestrian pieces and pieces of fine quality. It goes both ways.'' Mr. Godfrey was discussing the porcelains in Sotheby's  auction of Chinese art on Wednesday. ''The uninformed might focus on the glories of Ming,'' he said, ''but Qing imperial porcelains have always been highly sought after and reflect the highest levels of taste and appreciation.''</p>
        <p>There are Qing porcelains of all three types at Sotheby's, at Doyle's ''Asian Works of Art'' sale on Monday, at Christie's ''Fine Chinese Ceramics, Paintings and Works of Art'' auction on Thursday, and at the Arts of Pacific Asia Show at the 69th Regiment Armory (Lexington Avenue at 26th Street) from Thursday through Sept. 24. Several pieces are also for sale at the Chinese Porcelain Company, 475 Park Avenue, at 58th Street.</p>
        <p>China was successfully invaded from the north many times. In the 17th century it was the Manchus who conquered China, ending the long Ming dynasty (1368-1644). The last Ming emperor, Chongzhen, hanged himself from a plum tree north of Beijing, unable to deal with his warring generals and the pirates who dominated the southern seas and stole his exports. (In 1984 in Amsterdam there was a sale of 2,000 pieces of blue-and-white porcelain recovered from a sunken junk off the coast of China. The salvage specialist Michael Hatcher determined that the ship had gone down around 1644.)</p>
        <p>The Manchus, nomads descended from the Tangus tribes of northern China, were great warriors and traders, able to secure a monopoly in the sale of pearls, fur and ginseng. They surrounded themselves with Chinese advisers and once in power adopted Chinese culture.</p>
        <p>They did not interfere with the Chinese porcelain factories, though they did change the colors used. They introduced a vivid sapphire blue that replaced the purplish blue of the Ming period, the bright green seen in famille-verte ware and the palette of pinks that appear in famille-rose ware. The new colors were a hit in Europe, and Westerners especially prized works made under the second Qing emperor, Kangxi, a scholar and artistic patron who has been compared to Louis XIV. Kangxi ware was collected by Queen Mary II of Britain, the sultans of the Ottoman Empire and Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg and Prussia.</p>
        <p>The Chinese Porcelain Company is selling a pair of large blue-and-white Kangxi jars depicting foliate panels and ladies in gardens. They were made for export, and cost $50,000.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's is also selling a pair of blue-and-white Kangxi-period jars. The white baluster-shaped jars with lids are decorated with petal-shaped panels, each showing blue peonies, chrysanthemums and prunus (cherry) trees emanating from a rocky landscape. The estimate for the pair is $40,000 to $60,000.</p>
        <p>As the Paris dealer Michel Beurdeley and his colleague Guy Raindre write in their book, ''Qing Porcelain'' (Rizzoli, 1987): ''The quality of the blue-and-white ware made at this time attained a level that fired the enthusiasm, first of all, of Chinese connoisseurs and then, a little later, of European collectors. Technically, these wares are unequaled: the pure white and fine-grained body is covered with a faintly blueish-tinged glaze that sets off the decoration painted in sapphire blue.''</p>
        <p>Sotheby's has a beehive-shaped Kangxi water pot in a strawberry-pink glaze with dark speckles on it. It is lightly incised with dragons. Such pots are scholars' wares, in the Chinese taste. Called peach-bloom water pots, they have simple domed bodies rising to narrow rims. The estimate for the one at Sotheby's is $8,000 to $10,000.</p>
        <p>China's imperial factory continued to thrive under the following Qing emperor, Yongzheng (1723-1735), and his successor, Qianlong (1735-1795). Mr. Beurdeley and Mr. Raindre say that Jesuits introduced pink enamels into China in the early 18th century, and the new pinks and purples were called yangcai (foreign colors). The French referred to them as famille-rose.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's has a pair of 32-inch-high Yong zheng famille-rose baluster jars and covers that come with giltwood and marble stands. Each has medallions depicting Chinese figures at home and in the garden. The panels are surrounded by dense thickets of foliage, including lotus and peony blossoms in yellow, aqua, lime green and periwinkle. ''These are the type you see on a staircase landing in a grand late-19th-century house in America,'' Mr. Godfrey said. The estimate for the two is $120,000 to $140,000.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's is also selling a yellow Yongzheng chrysanthemum dish. Shallow like a saucer, it has sides molded to resemble a ring of petals, suggesting an open chrysanthemum flower. Yellow was reserved for members of the court. The estimate is $10,000 to $15,000.</p>
        <p>Westerners will love a pair of Qianlong cranes, with white bodies, dark blue and green plumage and small heads crowned by red crests. The crane, native to China, symbolized longevity and was sacred. Nonetheless these winning cranes were clearly made for export. The estimate for the pair is $20,000 to $30,000.</p>
        <p>Christie's two sales -- Chinese decorative arts at Christie's East on Monday and fine works of art at its headquarters on Thursday -- include about 60 pieces of Qing porcelain consigned by the Cleveland Museum of Art. The museum, which has had the collection since the 1930's, is selling them to bolster its acquisitions fund.</p>
        <p>One of the exceptional pieces is a 29-inch-tall famille-verte vase from the Kangxi period. It depicts a Daoist scene, a day in the realm of the immortals. The Daoist goddess Xiwangmu, the Queen Mother of the West, and her jade maidens are shown on the Isles of the Blessed. As two women fan her with peacock feathers, the queen watches a group approaching with a deer-pulled cart filled with flowers and a giant peach. In the Daoist tradition the queen's peach trees bore fruit only every 3,000 years. Anyone who ate a peach was granted immortality.</p>
        <p>''The painting is exquisite, the enamels are in very good condition, and the story is wonderfully fantastical,'' said Athena Zonars, a specialist in Chinese ceramics at Christie's. The estimate is $30,000 to $40,000.</p>
        <p>Less expensive Qing porcelains can be found on the Web, for under $2,000 at Sothebys.amazon.com, and at the Arts of Pacific Asia Show. One dealer at that show, Midori Gallery of Miami, is selling a five-piece famille-rose Qing garniture set from the late 19th century for $20,000. It has an incense burner, candle stands and flower vases decorated with dragons, phoenixes and bats of happiness.</p>
