        <p>Genentech Inc. and Novartis A.G. have partly suspended clinical trials of what is considered a highly promising drug for asthma and allergies after extremely high doses of the drug or of a related molecule caused low blood platelet counts and some deaths in monkeys.</p>
        <p>Tanox Inc., a small biotechnology company that helped develop the drug, reported the move in a regulatory filing yesterday.</p>
        <p>Genentech and Novartis have already applied to the Food and Drug Administration for permission to market the drug, known as Xolair, or E25, which some analysts expect could be a blockbuster, with sales of close to $1 billion or more. In clinical trials, E25 has allowed some asthma patients to wean themselves from steroids, which can have undesirable side effects.</p>
        <p>A Genentech spokeswoman confirmed the suspension of the trials but said Genentech and Novartis did not think the situation would hurt the drug's prospects for approval. The drug has been tested in nearly 2,000 people and the problems experienced by the monkeys were not seen in humans, except temporarily in five patients, she said.</p>
        <p>Shares of Tanox and Genentech dropped earlier this week when some investors first learned of the situation, but their prices have recovered somewhat.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's a nonissue,'' said Meirav Chovav, biotechnology analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ''But I don't think it's a big deal.''</p>
        <p>The monkeys that developed low platelet levels, a condition that can lead to uncontrolled bleeding, received 3 to 27 times the maximum clinical dose. Two out of 10 monkeys who received 15 times the maximum clinical dose of E26, the next generation drug, died.</p>
        <p>Trials of E26, which had begun in Europe, were put on hold, according to the Tanox filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trials of E25 were partly suspended: existing patients can continue treatments but new patients are not being accepted.</p>
