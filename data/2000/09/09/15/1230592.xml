        <p>One of the running jokes (or what passes for a joke) in the numbingly incoherent comic action thriller ''Bait'' has to do with the distinction between prawns and shrimp. You see, when Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx), a paroled thief, and a partner are caught red-handed stealing $2,000 worth of prawns from a Brooklyn warehouse, everyone, including the police, insists on calling them shrimp.</p>
        <p>Alvin is simply beside himself that people can't get the difference straight and points out more than once that prawns are larger than shrimp. But then, though Alvin may know his way around a fish store, he isn't the brightest light on the planet. While he is fiercely denying any involvement in the robbery, an interrogating officer reaches behind his ear, and what does he find tucked there? Why, a stray shrimp (oops, prawn), of course. At that moment the jig is up.</p>

        <p>One of the running jokes (or what passes for a joke) in the numbingly incoherent comic action thriller ''Bait'' has to do with the distinction between prawns and shrimp. You see, when Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx), a paroled thief, and a partner are caught red-handed stealing $2,000 worth of prawns from a Brooklyn warehouse, everyone, including the police, insists on calling them shrimp.</p>
        <p>Alvin is simply beside himself that people can't get the difference straight and points out more than once that prawns are larger than shrimp. But then, though Alvin may know his way around a fish store, he isn't the brightest light on the planet. While he is fiercely denying any involvement in the robbery, an interrogating officer reaches behind his ear, and what does he find tucked there? Why, a stray shrimp (oops, prawn), of course. At that moment the jig is up.</p>
        <p>The difference between prawns and shrimp, incidentally, has no relevance whatsoever to ''Bait'' beyond providing some tedious, high-pitched verbal filler for its motor-mouthed star. And although Mr. Foxx, his eyes gleaming, tries to pump up such inanities with his characteristic bleats of mischievous hysteria, not even this talented comic actor can levitate them.</p>
        <p>The biggest question concerning ''Bait'' is why, oh, why Mr. Foxx, who was so impressive in ''Any Given Sunday,'' chose to make a movie so boring and idiotic that it barely meets minimal standards of lowest-common-denominator entertainment.</p>
        <p>The story finds poor Alvin sharing a cell with one of the perpetrators of a $42 million heist of gold bricks from the Federal Reserve System. When his cellmate suddenly dies of a heart attack, Alvin is plucked from prison, implanted with a satellite-controlled radio device that continually broadcasts his location and is used as bait by a ruthless treasury investigator (David Morse) to flush out the mastermind of the ''heist of the decade.'' Because his cellmate buried the treasure, the reasoning goes, he may have left Alvin a deathbed clue of its whereabouts.</p>
        <p>The ploy succeeds, and before long, Bristol (Doug Hutchison), a villainous computer wizard who talks as if he is a robotic caricature of John Malkovich in his monster mode, is menacing Alvin's girlfriend, Lisa (Kimberly Elise), and their baby son.</p>
        <p>''Bait,'' directed by Antoine Fuqua from a screenplay by Andrew and Adam Scheinman and Tony Gilroy, is so frenetically choppy that its action sequences are impossible to follow. As a result, the movie's chases and demolition derbies have no continuity or visceral charge. After a while you begin to wonder if the director cheated and, instead of actually filming whole action sequences, shot bits and pieces and spliced them together. The result is an odoriferous helping of cinematic seafood whose pungency suggests that it has been sitting on the kitchen counter for weeks.</p>
        <p>''Bait'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations and some gory violence.</p>
        <p>BAIT  Directed by Antoine Fuqua; written by Tony Gilroy, Andrew Scheinman and Adam Scheinman; director of photography, Tobias Schleissler; edited by Alan Edward Bell; music by Mark Mancina; production designer, Peter Jamison; produced by Sean Ryerson; released by Castle Rock Entertainment/Warner Brothers.
