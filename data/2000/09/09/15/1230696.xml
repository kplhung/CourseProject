        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton acknowledged today that supporters of her Senate campaign had spent the night at the White House and at the Camp David presidential retreat, but she denied that the visits were rewards for political contributions.</p>
        <p>''We have friends and supporters come and spend time with us and spend the night with us that we are getting to know and who like spending time with us,'' Mrs. Clinton said this morning at a campaign stop in Buffalo, N.Y. ''I don't see what's news about that.''</p>

        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton acknowledged today that supporters of her Senate campaign had spent the night at the White House and at the Camp David presidential retreat, but she denied that the visits were rewards for political contributions.</p>
        <p>''We have friends and supporters come and spend time with us and spend the night with us that we are getting to know and who like spending time with us,'' Mrs. Clinton said this morning at a campaign stop in Buffalo, N.Y. ''I don't see what's news about that.''</p>
        <p>The first lady shook her head to indicate ''no'' when asked directly if she or her Senate campaign fund-raisers had offered a stay in the Lincoln Bedroom or at Camp David as a reward for a contribution or an enticement to raise money.</p>
        <p>Late last week, the White House declined to provide a list of overnight guests in response to a request from The New York Times. Officials said today they were preparing a list of overnight guests, but that it was not yet ready for release.</p>
        <p>Several Democratic fund-raisers have told The Times in recent days that the Clintons had used overnight stays at the White House to reward contributors to Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign. They said that Mrs. Clinton, alarmed by the recent financial success of her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, had ordered an acceleration of fund-raising efforts during a meeting late last week with top fund-raisers in New York. The meeting was also attended by President Clinton, fund-raisers said.</p>
        <p>A false report by Matt Drudge, the Internet gossip columnist, on Tuesday night that The Times was suppressing an article on the overnight stays prompted several media inquiries at the White House news briefing the following day. Mrs. Clinton was first asked about it this morning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio raised a stunning $10.7 million in a 45-day period this summer, a period in which Mrs. Clinton raised only $3.3 million in direct contributions. As of Sept. 1, Mr. Lazio had $10.2 million in the bank; Mrs. Clinton had $7.1 million.</p>
        <p>''She is totally freaked out about Lazio's money,'' said one longtime Democratic fund-raiser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''She wants to make sure there is enough to get us through November.''</p>
        <p>Harold M. Ickes, an adviser to Mrs. Clinton who is the former White House deputy chief of staff, declined to discuss the matter.</p>
        <p>The president has stepped up his efforts on Mrs. Clinton's behalf as well, phoning donors to thank them, appearing at several recent fund-raising events and signing a letter soliciting contributions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's fund-raising letter was mailed to potential donors late last week. It states, in part: ''Democrats better do everything in our power to make sure her voice is heard in the U.S. Senate. You can bet on this: Her opponents, especially on the Republican right, will spare no expense and respect no boundaries in their efforts to defeat her.''</p>
        <p>Today, Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said that officials were compiling a list of those who had spent the night at the White House and Camp David since Mrs. Clinton began considering a candidacy for the New York Senate seat early last year.</p>
        <p>''The president and the first lady, over the last seven and a half years, have always welcomed their friends and supporters and political officials from around the country, prominent members of the arts community, to stay at the White House,'' Mr. Lockhart said. ''Within that group, there certainly have been people who, as their friends, have supported them financially.''</p>
        <p>But he said overnight stays at the White House had never been promised or given as compensation for a political donation.</p>
        <p>The issue is particularly sensitive because President Clinton was widely criticized for inviting donors to  White House coffees, overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom and rides aboard Air Force One.</p>
        <p>''The Lincoln Bedroom was never sold,'' the president said in 1997.</p>
