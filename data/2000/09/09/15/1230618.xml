        <p>WITH American roads full of vehicles that are high, long and heavy, the time might not seem right to bring out a car that is low, short and light. Still, even as General Motors is planning a family of hulking, aggressive Hummers, BMW is polishing off the first member of a family of diminutive, amiable Minis.</p>
        <p>The new car -- the Mini's first redesign since its debut in 1959 -- goes on sale in Europe next year and in North America in early 2002. It will be publicly unveiled on Sept. 28 at the Paris auto show.</p>

        <p>WITH American roads full of vehicles that are high, long and heavy, the time might not seem right to bring out a car that is low, short and light. Still, even as General Motors is planning a family of hulking, aggressive Hummers, BMW is polishing off the first member of a family of diminutive, amiable Minis.</p>
        <p>The new car -- the Mini's first redesign since its debut in 1959 -- goes on sale in Europe next year and in North America in early 2002. It will be publicly unveiled on Sept. 28 at the Paris auto show.</p>
        <p>Late last month, at a press preview in Manhattan, Wolfgang Vollath, the car's global brand manager, said the Mini's appeal was, ''It's something friendly.'' Frank Stephenson, the chief designer, said the car retained the old Mini's ''characteristic face.'' Like the designers of some other reborn cars, including the next-generation Ford Thunderbird, Mr. Stephenson denied that the Mini's design was retro, preferring to call it ''an evolution of the original.''</p>
        <p>But the styling clearly evokes the classic Mini's. That may not be a big selling point in the United States, where the Mini is not well known -- particularly among the young people crucial to the new car's success.</p>
        <p>As before, the wheels are set in flared arches at the corners, giving the car a crouching, road-hugging look. The roof and outside mirrors come in black or white. The roof pillars are set behind glass, giving the impression of a window that wraps around the car, as in modern architecture.</p>
        <p>The base model in the United States will be the Mini Cooper, with a 1.6-liter, 4-cylinder engine and a base price of less than $18,000. A supercharged model is likely to follow, along with other variations, possibly including a convertible. ''You will be amazed by 2010 how many variations on the Mini will come,'' Mr. Vollath said.</p>
        <p>Although still relatively small -- nearly a foot shorter than the Chevrolet Metro -- the new car is 18 inches longer than the original. It will come with 16- or 17-inch wheels, compared with the 10-inch wheels of the first Mini. Safety features include side air bags, head-protection bags, antilock brakes and traction control.</p>
        <p>BMW kept the Mini brand when it sold the Rover car and Land Rover sport utility lines this year. It hopes Mini will bring in new customers without diluting the upscale image of the BMW brand. About 70 of its 342 American dealers will sell Minis, but they will have to build separate showrooms.</p>
        <p>The new Mini will be built in a renovated plant in Oxford, England, with eventual capacity of 100,000 cars a year.</p>
