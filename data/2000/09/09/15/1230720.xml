        <p>Democrats deride it as a gimmick. Republicans acknowledge that it is a Plan B fallback position from their cherished tax cuts. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle give it little chance of passing the Senate.</p>
        <p>Yet only two days after Republicans unveiled their proposal to commit 90 percent of the budget surplus in the next fiscal year to reducing the national debt, the plan is already having a political and policy impact.</p>
        <p>Though the Clinton administration and Democrats in Congress have scorned it as an unneeded law, Democratic lawmakers are loath to vote against it for fear of being tagged as not favoring reduction of the national debt. Today Democrats joined Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee in unanimously passing a bill to adopt the so-called 90-10 plan.</p>
        <p>The measure would require that the anticipated $198 billion surplus in the Social Security and Medicare trust funds be applied toward retiring the government's publicly held debt. It would also set up a separate account and transfer $42 billion of the non-Social Security and non-Medicare surplus into it. That money would also be used to retire debt.</p>
        <p>But Democrats warn that because the measure calls for such action for only one year, Republicans will try to divert more of the following year's  surplus into tax cuts if they gain control of the White House. They point out that Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, has pledged to enact a $1.3 trillion tax cut spread out over 10 years.</p>
        <p>Democrats also say that the Social Security and Medicare surpluses are considered sacrosanct and in recent years have only been used for debt reduction and that Mr. Clinton's spending proposals still leave room to pay down the national debt.</p>
        <p>As a result, Democrats say, the Republicans' measure is not needed.</p>
        <p>''We think this bill is pretty meaningless,'' said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who is a member of the committee. ''But we know the political effort that will be made on the part of Republicans, and we didn't want to put our members who are in competitive races at a disadvantage.''</p>
        <p>Under the Republican proposal, the roughly $28 billion that would remain in the budget after debt reduction would be used for tax cuts or for federal spending above the budget ceilings adopted by Congress last April. For the moment, Republican leaders envision providing $14 billion for spending increases and $14 billion for tax cuts.</p>
        <p>With Republicans having committed themselves so publicly to ''90-10,'' Congressional leaders may be less flexible in their negotiations with the White House, which Democrats note with some concern.</p>
        <p>At today's vote in the Ways and Means Committee, the panel's chairman, Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, noted that in 1998 Republicans, eager for Congress to adjourn so they could go home and campaign for re-election, went along with President Clinton's demands for increased spending.</p>
        <p>Mr. Archer said he felt that the 90-10 plan would help Republicans avoid caving in to Mr. Clinton -- an action that some political analysts say hurt them at the polls.</p>
        <p>Already, Democrats say the Republicans' debt-reduction proposal is having an effect on negotiations between the White House and Congress on spending bills.</p>
        <p>Even though the White House and Congressional Republicans were only $30 million apart, talks over a $15.6 billion measure to finance the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, construction of new federal courthouses, and enhanced counterterrorism measures stalled today because the bill contained a repeal of the telephone excise tax that would cost the Treasury about $5 billion a year.</p>
        <p>Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said: ''The administration is saying, 'Look we got this 90-10 thing. We don't want to sign a bill with a telephone tax repeal if we have to commit 25 percent of what's left of the surplus into this tax cut. There may be other tax cuts that we would prefer and there may be other initiatives that we want.''</p>
        <p>Republicans scoff at the notion that their plan caused problems with the spending bill. The real difficulty, they say, is that the White House is tossing up roadblocks to Congress's completing work on the budget.</p>
        <p>''Last week it was not enough money for the I.R.S., then it was courthouses, then it was counterterrorism,'' said Representative Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona. ''Now that 90-10 is on the table, suddenly it's 90-10. No matter how many hurdles you go over, there's always one more.''</p>
        <p>Without an agreement with the White House, Republicans brought the Treasury financing bill to the House floor, bundling it with a $2.5 billion spending measure to finance the legislative branch. The package squeaked by, 212 to 209.</p>
        <p>The House also approved a $414 million measure financing the District of Columbia's government, voting 217 to 207, largely along party lines.</p>
