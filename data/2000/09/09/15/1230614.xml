        <p>My husband and I are certainly not farmers, not even the weekend-in-the-backyard variety. But there are moments, especially as the air starts to chill, when I survey the obscenely generous mounds of lettuce, eggplants and apples at the Union Square Greenmarket and feel a twinge of longing. I imagine us in rough clothes standing in an orchard laden with autumn fruit, plucking just-ripened pears from a tree and tossing them into straw baskets. Tilling the soil might not be for us, but harvesting -- we could handle that.</p>
        <p>Heeding this impulse, we ventured recently into the Hudson Valley with its smattering of wineries and enormous tracts of cultivated land. If ever there is a time to enjoy the farm country to the city's north, it is early fall. Already, the first brushes of red and yellow have begun to appear on an occasional tree, and for the next four weeks, the valley will be at its most colorful and its most bountiful.</p>

        <p>My husband and I are certainly not farmers, not even the weekend-in-the-backyard variety. But there are moments, especially as the air starts to chill, when I survey the obscenely generous mounds of lettuce, eggplants and apples at the Union Square Greenmarket and feel a twinge of longing. I imagine us in rough clothes standing in an orchard laden with autumn fruit, plucking just-ripened pears from a tree and tossing them into straw baskets. Tilling the soil might not be for us, but harvesting -- we could handle that.</p>
        <p>Heeding this impulse, we ventured recently into the Hudson Valley with its smattering of wineries and enormous tracts of cultivated land. If ever there is a time to enjoy the farm country to the city's north, it is early fall. Already, the first brushes of red and yellow have begun to appear on an occasional tree, and for the next four weeks, the valley will be at its most colorful and its most bountiful.</p>
        <p>Verdant from weeks of rain and lush with ripening produce, the Hudson Valley's farms did not disappoint. We were pleasantly surprised by the access an average visitor has to all but the most delicate crops. While you-pick pumpkin and apple farms still dominate the landscape, a curious tourist can also pick exotic heirloom vegetables, clip flowers from gardens full of scarlet pansies and purple asters and even gather and stomp grapes at local wineries.</p>
        <p>The Hudson Valley is farmed intensively for long stretches on both banks. We chose Rhinebeck, about two and a half hours from Manhattan, as a base of operations, as much for the rural charms of the surrounding country as for the cosmopolitan amenities available nearby. Kneeling in the dirt to discover the perfect chardonnay cluster of grapes is satisfying, but one need not abandon first-class restaurants to do it.</p>
        <p>In wine areas harvest time is busy, marked by both celebration and frenetic gathering. The Hudson Valley, which is home to two score vintners, is no different.</p>
        <p>The climax of the season is known as the crush. This encompasses a surprisingly brief three-to-four-week period in which the vintner determines that the grapes have reached peak ripeness and then rushes to cull them from the vines before they rot or are destroyed by frost.</p>
        <p>Crush in the Hudson Valley traditionally begins in September. In a warm year it starts soon after Labor Day, but this year it could start any time from now until the first of October.</p>
        <p>Once the crush begins, vineyards become almost-Tolstoyan scenes of activity. Fields fill with workers at the picturesque but back-breaking labor of snipping the sun-darkened clusters and loading them into wooden crates. At the winery grapes are sorted and loaded into the crusher and the juice is strained into waiting vats, while the vintner adds his own magic ingredients to the potion.</p>
        <p>An outsider's experience of the crush varies a great deal with the size, setup and temperament of a winery. Many wineries do not grow their own grapes but are happy to give tours that allow visitors to see the inner workings of their operations. My preference is for small operations, because the tours are more informal and are frequently led by the people who know the most.</p>
        <p>A Visit to a Winery</p>
        <p>A year or so ago, friends of ours, following a personal passion, started a small operation outside Red Hook called Alison Wines and Vineyards. The tasting room is connected by French doors to an enormous converted barn where all the winemaking activities take place, from grape unloading through fermenting and bottling.</p>
        <p>During our visit this year, folks dropping in were simply encouraged to wander about. When the owner and vintner, Richard Lewit, a chemistry graduate from Bard College, was not otherwise engaged, he happily chatted with the curious about everything from the machinery to his winemaking.</p>
        <p>Although the small operations are more intimate, it is still worth a visit to at least one winery that grows its own grapes, if only to take in the swelling hills with their endless rows of silvering leaves. Most wineries sensibly insist on keeping tourists at arm's length from the picking process -- getting the grapes in swiftly is serious business and city folk tend to be a little more lax than the locals like.</p>
        <p>''We used to invite people up to come pick,'' said Phyllis Feder, the owner of scenic Clinton Vineyards, ''but then we found that they would pick three grapes and then want to sit down for lunch.''</p>
        <p>For now she will arrange for groups of eight or more to have a picnic lunch in the vineyards if they call ahead.</p>
        <p>For those still determined to feel the weight of the fruit in their own palms, a sure option is Cascade Mountain Winery in Amenia. Set back in picturesque hills, Cascade is a formidable trek from the Taconic State Parkway. (The man on the phone said 20 minutes, but the drive took closer to 45.) Its owners not only permit tourists to go into the fields and gather grapes in a bucket at their own pace; they also pay by the bucket for your labor.</p>
        <p>And the arbors, nestled at the foot of a scenic bluff and on a plain that offers expansive views of the vines and the feather tips of corn plants below, are a lovely place to play winemaker for a few hours. The winery has a patio restaurant that is run by the Culinary Institute of America. The food is almost as indifferent as the service, but that is not why you visit.</p>
        <p>For those still itching to live out a fuller romantic fantasy of winemaking, the Brotherhood Winery, which is south of New Paltz on the west side of the river, has grape-stomping contests every weekend in October and November.</p>
        <p>But a word of caution: do not expect the Tuscan original. Instead of kerchiefed women knee-deep in a vat of grapes, you get four or five wood tubs lined with garbage bags and a polka band as background entertainment. Still, the fruit is real underfoot and only a little slimy.</p>
        <p>Earthly Treats</p>
        <p>Along almost every road in the region, farm stands beckon to passers-by. Like wineries, farms in the region exist along a spectrum from authentic to hyperkitsch. On the less bearable end are farms that exist mostly to entertain tourists. At the other extreme are farms where real work is done but which are sometimes so small or busy that they are not well equipped to handle visitors.</p>
        <p>Greig Farm in Red Hook offers a nice balance. Behind a Norman Rockwell-perfect red barn are acres of rolling hills covered with trim lines of apple trees, raspberry bushes and other fall fruits. My family spent a very pleasant half-hour one misty morning filling a plastic basket with blackberries. Much of the fruit was mouth-puckering, but the joy came from searching out the ripest-looking berries among the brambles and plucking them whole.</p>
        <p>When one tires of picking, Greig also has a store where one can buy farm sundries like fruit preserves or fresh fried doughnuts (highly recommended); a paddock of goats eager to be petted and fed; and a lovely open field for picnicking. My son, age 3, was perfectly entertained just looking at the enormous tractors parked by the side of the barn.</p>
        <p>Off the Beaten Path</p>
        <p>For those looking for a more off-the-beaten path experience, or more exotic crops, Four Winds Organic Farm in Gardiner is worth a stop. Four Winds is a working co-op, meaning that a good chunk of the farm's produce is presold to people or institutions that subscribe ahead of time and collect the bounty as it is harvested. But Four Winds produces extra, so its owners, Polly and Jay Armour, are more than willing to let visitors cull leftovers if they call ahead.</p>
        <p>This year the Armours are growing 20 varieties of heirloom tomatoes with exotic names, textures and colors. Black Krym from Russia are black, and the Rose Tomato is giant and pinkish like the flower. Although we sampled the zebra tomato, Radiator Joe's Mortgage Lifters and a peach tomato, which is yellow and has soft fuzz, the tiny, orange cherry tomatoes still warm from the sun were particularly irresistible, tangy sweet like a tangerine.</p>
        <p>Hawthorne Valley Farm, in Harlemville, is another good place for people interested in moving beyond vegetables. It is a biodynamic, organic farm, meaning that everything for the farm from feed for cows to fertilizer for the field is all made there. The farm also serves as a school, and its owners, Rachel and Steffen Schneider, welcome visitors as a way to share their farming philosophy. Drop by and corner the nearest helping hand: everyone we met was friendly, and eventually somebody will give you a tour.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the operation are the dairy cows, which are kept in open pens. The fragrant smell of hay and warm manure perfume the air all the way to the parking area. Although the general tour includes a look at the garden and the pig pens, the best part is the dairy processing area, which is warm and moist and smells sweetly of rich cream. Hawthorne sells raw milk, which really is a far cry from the pasteurized product in supermarkets. One can almost taste the grass the cows ate.</p>
        <p>In October both Greig and Hawthorne farms have harvest festival weekends, which include hay rides and farm games and crafts.</p>
        <p>The Charms of the Market</p>
        <p>Our family also particularly enjoyed the Sunday farmers' market in downtown Rhinebeck. Although only a fraction of the size of its giant cousin on Union Square, it is charmingly country paced. This is the chance to buy products from local farms that are not open to the public and do not necessarily sell in New York City.</p>
        <p>Amy Goldman was chopping up and offering sections of some of the 130 varieties of heirloom melons she grows. My favorite was the Early White Prescott, a French variety whose inside was as rich an orange as butternut squash. She does give garden groups tours of her melon patches if they call ahead; (914) 266-4545.</p>
        <p>My toddler was struck motionless for nearly 15 minutes in front of the representatives from Spring Wool Farm, who had brought a spinning wheel and were busy turning fleece into yarn -- surely that, as any parent will recognize, is worth a trip in itself.</p>
        <p>Highland Premium Venison had liverwurst, ground meat and sausage. We bought some delicious jerky, loaded it into the car with the rest of our weekend harvest spoils -- the blackberries, a raw-milk cheese, several bottles of chardonnay -- and, very pleased with ourselves, chewed on it all the way home.</p>
