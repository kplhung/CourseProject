        <p>A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>''AMAZONS OF THE AVANT-GARDE,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several of them continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If only a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibition isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems if anything more, not less, remarkable, for having as little to do with sex as it does, and almost everything to do with painting. The works, many of them anyway, have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8, students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).</p>

        <p>''AMERICAN MODERN, 1925-1940: DESIGN FOR A NEW AGE'' (through Jan. 7) and ''A CENTURY OF DESIGN, PART 2: 1925-1950'' (through Oct. 29), Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. ''American Modern,'' the larger and more interesting of these shows, deals with the period between two design extravaganzas, L'Exposition des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris in 1925 and the New York World's Fair of 1939-40. Drawn from the Met's own collection and that of a patron, John C. Waddell, the show presents furniture, appliances, clocks, radios, cameras, textiles, tableware, posters and parts of a snappy blue-and-chrome dining room, along with other work by Bel Geddes, Deskey, Dreyfuss, Frankl, Loewy, Noguchi, Teague and Wright. The range is from French Art Deco, whose hallmark was luxury and chic, through Bauhaus geometric austerity, to the machine-influenced, streamlined mode developed by American industrial designers. ''A Century of Design,'' Part 2 of a four-part survey focusing on European 20th-century styles, also draws from the Met's collection. Although studded with star names like Aalto, Breuer, Eames, Ruhlmann and Mies, the show is lackluster by contrast. There is no scarcity of famous chairs, and other good things include a wonderful scale drawing for the Daimler-Benz sport convertible No. 3384 (circa 1933). But there are more than a few nontreasures, like Miro's 1942 earthenware vase, whose raison d'etre is hard to determine. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and the elderly (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>''ART AT WORK: 40 YEARS OF THE CHASE MANHATTAN COLLECTION,'' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-5555 (through Oct. 1). On the 40th anniversary of the Chase Manhattan Collection, which since 1960 has displayed more than 17,000 works of art in places where Chase does business, a sampling from its multinational, intercontinental holdings is on view here. Filling every corner of the museum, the work includes pieces by contemporary stars like Chuck Close, Scott Burton, Peter Halley, Nam June Paik, Richard Prince and Christian Boltanski. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (John Russell).</p>
        <p>''ARTIST IN THE MARKETPLACE: 20th ANNUAL EXHIBITION,'' Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, (718) 681-6000 (through Oct. 15). Organized by Lydia Yee and Edwin Ramoran, this is the 20th edition of an annual residency program show for 36 participants. Three dozen artists are about two dozen too many for the allotted basement space, and with room for only one or two entries a person, almost everyone gets the benefit of the doubt, critically speaking. Some work always manages to make an impression, and the most promising this year takes the form of a light-touch brand of text-based conceptualism. Hours: Wednesdays, 3 to 9 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $3; $2, students and the elderly; free on Wednesdays (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>''CURIOS AND TREASURES,'' Costume Institute, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through Jan. 21). Well-selected, expertly installed and beautifully lighted, this exhibition is permeated with the sense of several sets of eyes doing the right thing. Its 65 garments and accessories, some fancy, some very plain, are all from the institute's collection. They travel through four or five centuries of European culture, touching down lightly here and there. Highlights include a suite of dresses and capes by the great Mariano Fortuny, a pielike leather hat from early 17th-century Austria, a formidable farmer's smock from 19th-century England and three rare 17th-century men's doublets. While this assortment may sound a bit piecemeal, the overall effect is close to magical, conveying a vivid sense of how invention, evolution and historical borrowing combine in the life of any art form. The installation makes the act of looking a nearly undiluted pleasure. Hours and admission: See above (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>''THE FIGURE: ANOTHER SIDE OF MODERNISM,'' Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, (718) 448-2500 (through Jan. 15). This vast, uneven but enthralling grab bag of a show invites us to count the ways that artists have painted the human figure during the past 50 years. The curator, Lily Wei, selected 125 paintings by as many artists, including most of the usual suspects, from Willem de Kooning to Lisa Yuskavage. Among the best works are a huge grisaille painting of a towering giantess by Alfred Leslie; a radiant portrait of his wife by Alex Katz; Catherine Murphy's intensely realistic picture of big feet; and Elliot Green's fusion of a Mondrianesque grid and a rubbery cartoon couple. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $2 (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>BARBARA KRUGER, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Oct. 22). A lot has changed about the art world in the 20 years or so since Barbara Kruger came on the scene with her snappy photomontages, but a lot has not changed about her work. Her trademark red, white and black text-and-photograph montage is a brand product of the immediate past. Dense and noisy, this retrospective, including audio embellishments, has an intended carnival atmosphere without frivolity. Your reaction will necessarily depend on a blend of generational sympathy, political concord, aesthetic expectation and tolerance for sarcasm. Ms. Kruger was one of the 80's artists adapting Conceptualism via mass- media forms for political ends, thereby helping to broaden the purview of contemporary art and make the art world more gender-balanced. Young artists reacting against her sort of political stridency now explore subtler, more aesthetically varied routes toward expressions of selfhood. Ms. Kruger, in a sense, helped to pave the way for her own diminished currency, which for a political artist like her may be viewed as a kind of success. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''MAKING CHOICES, 1920-1960,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Sept. 26). The main event at the Modern these days is the museum itself. This has been the case since last fall, when the project ''MOMA 2000'' began the first of what will be three successive top-to-bottom reinstallations of the permanent-collection galleries. The affair has been billed as a test drive for the future, a chance for an institution to rethink the modern art tradition that it helped invent and to consider its own identity in what is often called a postmodern world. This second installment, which looks denser, weirder, messier and more truly modern (or maybe postmodern) than the first, is a big leap in the right direction. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''PAINTERS IN PARIS: 1895-1950,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Dec. 31). This show of more than 100 paintings celebrates the Met's acquisitions of works by School of Paris painters, going back to 1946 when Gertrude Stein bequeathed her portrait, done by Picasso in 1906. The portrait served as a cornerstone for later acquisitions in the field, particularly over the last 20 years. The museum's increasing interest and diligent wooing of collectors have brought not only single works but also groups and entire holdings, like the 18 major objects bequeathed by Florene M. Schoenborn in 1995 and the Jacques and Natasha Gelman trove of 85 masterpieces accessioned in 1998. The treasures on view include works by some of the 20th century's greatest: Bonnard, Braque, Chagall, de Chirico, Derain, Gris, Leger, Matisse, Miro, Modigliani and Picasso, in an animated arrangement that should beguile the most jaded Met-goer. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG: SYNAPSIS SHUFFLE,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Oct. 8). Mr. Rauschenberg's latest divertissement -- if one may use that word for such a dull performance -- is a group of 52 panels, the number alluding to a full deck of cards, each bearing a mix of photographic images taken by the artist and transferred to the panels' polylaminate surfaces. The images include objects, street scenes, people and natural phenomena, along with snippets from advertising, magazines and newspapers. Involved with the notion of audience participation in his art for many years, Mr. Rauschenberg invited 12 fellow celebrities to ''compose'' their own works, creating ''new'' ones by selecting from several of the panels and placing them in whatever juxtaposition came to mind. The celebrities obliged, among them the television journalist Mike Wallace, the soprano Renee Fleming, the choreographer Merce Cunningham and the talent agent and art collector Michael Ovitz. Aside from the fact that it's a little hard to buy the premise that anyone can create a new work simply by pushing around the artist's components, they had cliched material to work with. Over the years Mr. Rauschenberg has been an enormous influence in the art world, making pioneering use of the transfer technique, among other contributions. But in the last decade and a half his use of these images has become platitudinous. The pretentiousness of ''Synapsis Shuffle,'' its celebrity-kissing self-promotion and the wasteful allotment of nearly 6,000 square feet of gallery at the space-challenged Whitney are not cause for celebration. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''MARTHA ROSLER: POSITIONS IN THE LIFE WORLD,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Oct. 8), and International Center of Photography, Fifth Avenue at 94th Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Oct. 1). This 30-year career retrospective is also the first major museum show for this seminal Brooklyn-born artist, and even spread over two museums it's of a piece: crowded, agitated, funny and political. Ms. Rosler was involved in the peace movement and feminism in the 1960's and responded with art that combined moral brashness and a television-generation sense of the absurd. Aware of the co-opting power of the market, she chose mediums that were either ephemeral or easily reproduced and distributed. The show mixes all of them together, with video and photography -- her best work -- concentrated uptown and installations (including a cash-and-carry garage sale) at the New Museum. Despite her self-description as a ''ham-fisted'' artist, her work is full of subtleties. It may have little to say to a viewer for whom taste, style and beauty are the exclusive building blocks of art, but as an art of ideas that lead to actions, its deeply skeptical utopianism is as vital now as it was in the past. Hours at the New Museum: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 p.m. New Museum admission: $6; $3 for students, artists and the elderly. Hours at the International Center of Photography: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Center admission: $6; $4 for students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''THE S-FILES/THE SELECTED FILES,'' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272 (through Sept. 24). This museum has a policy of reviewing all slides sent in by artists, and for this group show the curators Deborah Cullen and Yasmin Ramirez selected submissions from the last year, making a lively assemblage. It has no overriding theme, and certain political and religious images automatically tagged as Latino are absent or at least played down. The results don't exactly constitute a post-identity gathering, but on the whole the show takes an oblique approach to social issues, exploring them by way of forms and materials. Work by Domingo Nuno, Juana Valdes, Fernanda Brunet, Alejandro Diaz and the artists who go by the names of Malika, Rabindranat and Vargas-Suarez Universal look particularly good. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>DON GUMMER, Salander O'Reilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606 (through Sept. 30). In Mr. Gummer's Cubist bronze sculptures, boxes, rods and slatted planes are caught up in anti-gravitational tension between geometric order and dynamic flux. Pushed to more expansive extremes, the possibilities could be interesting, but these works, with their stained glass accents, are restrained by decorative decorum (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''PORTRAITS OF LEO,'' Leo Castelli, 59 East 79th Street, (212) 249-4470 (through Oct. 7). This tasteful memorial show presents an assortment of affectionate portraits by artists who were supported and promoted by the gallery's founder, Leo Castelli, who died a year ago. It includes a candy-colored picture by Andy Warhol; a small, rumpled photograph of the dealer in a halo of light by Mike and Doug Starn; an amusingly kitschy ceramic head by Meyer Vaisman; the dealer's name spelled in green neon by Bruce Nauman; his ghostly image seen through a jigsaw puzzle screen by Jasper Johns; and an Abstract Expressionist likeness made by Elaine de Kooning in 1954 (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>SHIRLEY GOLDFARB, Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-1223 (through Sept. 23). Like the first, held only two years ago, the second New York gallery show devoted to Shirley Goldfarb (1925-1980) leaves one wanting a fuller picture. Goldfarb, who spent most of her adult life in Paris, produced tenderly handmade paintings using incremental strokes of color applied with a palette knife. The mosaiclike results relate to contemporary efforts by Yayoi Kusama, Agnes Martin and David Budd; they are animated by constant flucuations of tone and space that in large works like ''1977'' can swing exuberantly between the literal and the optical (Smith).</p>
        <p>ROBERT POLIDORI, Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999 (through Oct. 14) In its visual sumptuousness and oblique sociology, Mr. Polidori's architectural photography calls to mind photographers like Andreas Gursky or Thomas Struth. His images of ruined palatial interiors in Palm Springs or Havana are cinematically gripping; his picture of a room in Beirut with a bullet-pocked yellow wall and blue sky showing through another blown-out wall is like a terrible but beautiful dream (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>BARRY GOLDBERG, Howard Scott, 529 West 20th Street, (646) 486-7004 (through Oct. 7). This Philadelphia-based painter makes sensuously appealing abstractions combining near-Minimalist graphic design and waxy or streaky surfaces. With their hard-edged, round-cornered rectangles and sherbet colors, they evoke nostalgia for the purist Modernism of the 1960's (Johnson).</p>
        <p>YOSHIO ITAGAKI, Cristinerose, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-0297 (through Sept. 30). Through the miracle of digital technology, this Japanese-born New York artist produces oddly banal photomontages depicting ordinary tourists on the moon, with the earth looming over the horizon in every case. In another series, tourists are inserted into video game scenes. Something about the disconnected rootlessness of modern life is implied, but these works are less amusing than they should be (Johnson).</p>
        <p>LESLIE WAYNE, Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, (212) 645-1701 (through Oct. 7). Paintings don't come much thicker than Ms. Wayne's. The artist layers paint into two-inch-deep boxes and then gouges into the still-wet oil with instruments or her hands, producing deep, multicolored gashes. In a whole-wall piece, scattered punctures and slashes colorfully bleed; the effect is at once prettily decorative and viscerally violent (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>''PASTORAL POP!,'' Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453 (through Dec. 15). Nature-inspired kitsch is the theme of this delirious seven-artist show. It includes Rob de Mar's comical landscape in the form of a spindly tree, Lisa Ruyter's psychedelic update of Seurat's ''Grande Jatte,'' Alyson Shotz's grove of weird plant machines, Peter Gould's transformation of the guard station into a bucolic cartoon, Jason Middlebrook's Styrofoam stonewall planter, Katrin Asbury's miniature diorama in a planter and Rachel Feinstein's suspended Rococo-style pitcher exploding flowers like a pinata (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>''AT THE EDGE: A PORTUGUESE FUTURIST -- AMADEO DE SOUZA CARDOSO,'' AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-1704 (through tomorrow). One of those perfect dropped-from-the-sky retrospectives, this show introduces a talented and ambitious Portuguese modernist who died at 30 in 1918. In the previous 10 years he had absorbed several budding modern art movements in Paris, especially Cubism and Futurism, combined them with references to things Portuguese, and produced vividly colored, carefully calibrated paintings. They seem ahead of their time in their mixing of styles, images, materials and cultural references. His exceptional draftsmanship is shown in a series of ultrarefined drawings that suggest Ingres high on Cubism (Smith).</p>
        <p>''THE BIRTH OF BAROQUE: CARRACCI AT THE METROPOLITAN,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7700 (through Sunday). If the familyn known as Carracci -- Annibale (1560-1609), his brother Agostino (1557-1602) and their cousin Ludovico (1555-1619) -- didn't exactly invent the dynamic art known as Baroque, they gave their all to it. Ludovico developed an important academy that sought to correct what he considered the distortions of the prevailing Mannerist style by returning to natural forms and the heritage of the great Italian masters like Correggio, Veronese and Titian. Annibale, considered one of the greatest draftsmen of the age, was helped by Agostino in his creation of a highly influential fresco cycle for the ceiling of the Farnese Palace in Rome that brought back the Renaissance love of human drama and emotion. This small but illustrious show of paintings, drawings and prints from the Metropolitan's own collection of Carracci works offers paintings like Ludovico's innovative ''Lamentation'' (1582), a shockingly realistic Pieta scene and Annibale's ''Coronation of the Virgin'' (about 1596), a symmetrical composition showing the Virgin crowned Queen of Heaven by Jesus and God the Father, which reflects the classicism of his Roman style. But the Carracci powers of observation and ability to handle complicated narratives is best seen in their drawings and prints, which range from Annibale's charmingly intimate ink with wash, ''Domestic Scene'' to Ludovico's ambitious ''Last Communion of St. Jerome,'' a tightly composed altarpiece proposal. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>JAMES LEE BYARS, ''The Poetic Conceit and Other Black Works,'' Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623 (through tomorrow). Relentlessly pursuing perfection, the conceptualist Byars (1932-1997) was a performer and object maker in the tradition of Duchamp. His influences included Zen philosophy and Noh drama, and his work ran to austere shapes of gold, marble, glass and paper. In his legendary performances he did things like enveloping 100 nude volunteers in a single overall garment and arranging in an exactly symmetrical pattern 100 white marbles on the floor of an all-white room. His favorite colors were red, gold, black and white, but this small show is devoted to works in black, including ''The New Moon'' (1993), a poetic wall arrangement of seven black crescents cut from silk paper, each covered by a crescent of glass that gives it a silvery edge. Byars's own presence was very much part of his work, and it's not at all surprising that his fey anima still seems to inhabit it (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''DANCING DEMONS: CEREMONIAL MASKS OF MONGOLIA,'' Asia Society at Midtown, 502 Park Avenue, at 59th Street, (212) 288-6400 (through Sunday). The religious art of Mongolia is a hybrid of shamanism and Buddhism. It takes a particularly dynamic form in fantastic sculptural masks made to be worn in epic-scale religious dramas that were part morality play, part circus and part public exorcism. Several of those masks -- vividly painted, larger than life -- are in this show. They represent skeletal henchmen of the god of death, clownish holy men and bug-eyed protectors of the Buddhist law, who look like demons but were meant to frighten evil away. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>ANH DUONG, Tony Shafrazi, 119 Wooster Street, (212) 274-9300, SoHo (through tomorrow). On raw, artfully stained canvases, this self-taught painter and former fashion model uses thin brushes to draw linear, expressionistic images of herself nude or in sexy lingerie, evoking an Egon Schielesque mood of jaded, melancholic eroticism (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''FROM THE STUDIO: ARTISTS IN RESIDENCE 2000,'' Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500 (through Sunday). In the past, this annual show has given its three artists separate spaces in the gallery; this year the curator, Thelma Golden, mixed them together, amplifying common themes, all of which touch on history. The paintings of Nicole Awai, from Trinidad, take colonialism as their subject in overlaid images of tropical birds, antique prints and illustrations from the British-published schoolbooks she grew up with. Terry Boddie, from Nevis in the eastern Caribbean, in a hushed blend of photography, paint and collage, looks back to Africa and to his family. California-born Sanford Biggers, who is the standout here, brings together art history, 1960's black-power politics, world religion and hip-hop culture with a wry, urban energy. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Fridays, noon to 8 p.m.; admission is $5; $3 for students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''LUX ET TENEBRAE,'' Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0441 (through tomorrow). This fine selection from 20 years' worth of Peter Blum's print publishing includes a giant, crisp woodcut by Alex Katz; many surreal autobiographical etchings by Louise Bourgeois; exquisitely refined Constructivist compositions by David Rabinowitch; an allegory of racism in the tropics done in overripe colors by Eric Fischl; sensuous yet cerebral colored woodcut checkerboards by Sherrie Levine; and floating blocks made of squiggly red lines by Yukinori Yanagi (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ALICE NEEL, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Sunday). The pleasures of this rewarding exhibition are dampened by the feeling that Neel's long, fruitful career could have sustained a larger effort, one that parses her evolution chapter and verse, on paper and canvas, instead of concentrating on the well-known portraits of her last 25 years. These portraits, which usually feature family members or denizens of the art world, are frequently great and always marvelously loquacious. Color, shape and brushwork, along with Neel's signature distortions of body and face, all have their say, and both the painterly process and the human psyche are repeatedly laid bare. Neel, never less than interesting and always striving, operated in the gap between the Stieglitz circle and the Abstract Expressionists with a fruitfulness matched only by Stuart Davis's; like his late work, hers is an indelible part of the postwar period. It's time for a full-dress, or in Whitney terms, a two-floor, treatment. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).</p>
        <p>''NEW YORK CLASSICISM NOW,'' Hirschl &amp; Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810 (through today). This mix of representational and abstract artworks makes a confusing case for contemporary classicism. It includes traditionalist works like Graydon Parrish's French Academy-style funeral allegory and Christopher Gallego's large, intensely observed paintings of studio interiors. But, mysteriously, it also offers confectionery Color Field pictures by Jennifer Riley; a complex geometric sculpture made of little wooden blocks by John Powers; and copies of old master paintings with clever alterations by Kathleen Gilje (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''PASSAGES,'' Photographs in Africa by Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Sunday). This exhibition is like a giant walk-in issue of National Geographic: it is entertaining, titillating and, in places, thrilling; but as art and anthropology, it is kitsch. Ms. Beckwith, an American, and Ms. Fisher, an Australian, have sought out remote African tribes whose traditions continue to flourish, apparently unaffected by outside influences. Big to mural-scale color photographs and short videotapes show people from all parts of the continent, in traditional finery, dancing, marrying, tending children, conducting funerals and so on. The Africa that emerges is a sanitized paradise of beautiful noble savages. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 students and the elderly (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''SIX WOMEN ARTISTS,'' Kate Ganz, 25 East 73rd Street, (212) 535-1977 (through today). This show's main attraction is a group of four small works on paper by Eva Hesse, three from the early 1960's made under the influence of Abstract Expressionism and one from 1968 depicting a pair of white circles that is closer to her mature sensibility. Also included are a brushy, four-square abstraction by Grace Knowlton; loopy, linear prints by Dorothea Rockburne; Seurat-style charcoal landscapes by Susan Crowder; more or less abstract drawings by Deborah Hede and Sarah Plimpton; and a pale, multiframed narrative by Emily Brown (Johnson).</p>
