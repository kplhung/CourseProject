        <p>'Dream America'</p>
        <p>Lawrence Rubin, Greenberg Van Doren</p>
        <p>730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street,  Manhattan</p>
        <p>Through Sept. 30</p>
        <p>Katy Grannan's large color photographs of unnamed, usually unclothed people are visually striking and voyeuristically irresistible. They also induce twinges of moral queasiness.</p>
        <p>Yale-trained Ms. Grannan belongs to a new wave of adventurous young female photographers that includes Justine Kurland and Malarie Marder, among others. To produce the works in this, her first solo exhibition, Ms. Grannan placed classified ads seeking art models in small newspapers in upstate New York, Texas and Wisconsin. She photographed respondents in their homes, offering each a $50 fee. The results are unflinching full-length portraits, mostly of women and men in their 20's or 30's. Some pictures show couples or mothers with children. Judging from the interior furnishings, most subjects are from the lower economic end of society.</p>
        <p>A worried-looking blond woman with tattoos on her breast and hip kneels nude yet oddly demure before louvered blinds and a simulated stone wall. A willowy woman with shaved pubic hair stands near her two dogs before an enormous, deeply padded corner sofa. A tall, regal-looking woman stands under a lowered tile ceiling nursing her tiny baby. One thinks of Diane Arbus, though Ms. Grannan's works are formally bland by comparison and not so powerfully intimate.</p>
        <p>What is troubling is the hint of hip condescension. In setting up her project as a Pop-Conceptualist experiment, Ms. Grannan is toying with matters of class and desire (note the ironic title, ''Dream America'') in a way that feels uncomfortably close to slumming.</p>
