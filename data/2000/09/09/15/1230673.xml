        <p>She delivered the winning goal in the 1996 Summer Olympics and led the Americans in scoring during the 1999 Women's World Cup, yet Tiffeny Milbrett has always felt like something of an outsider.</p>
        <p>She did not play collegiately at North Carolina, which is essentially a farm system for the American women's national team. She clashed with Tony DiCicco, the former coach, believing he was too rigid. For Milbrett, soccer is a kind of jazz, something that must be felt instead of instructed.</p>
        <p>April Heinrichs, the new coach of the national team, has given Milbrett the freedom she craved, and she responded tonight with one goal and very nearly three others as the United States dominated Norway, its most intractable rival, by 2-0 in the opening match of the Olympic women's soccer tournament.</p>
        <p>Milbrett scored on a brilliant counterattack in the 18th minute and slammed one ball off the left post, one off the right post and another off the crossbar. Mia Hamm added the second goal in the 24th minute. The Americans smothered Norway in the midfield and played most of the game in the opponent's end on a cold, blustery evening.</p>
        <p>These are the Summer Games, but it is late winter in the Southern Hemisphere. Having grown up in Hillsboro, Ore., and having played at the University of Portland, Milbrett was more than accustomed to chilly conditions and a field made slick by a late afternoon rain. Thanks largely to her speed and agility, the Americans are in great position to advance to the semifinals. They have group matches remaining against China on Sunday and Nigeria on Wednesday. China defeated Nigeria, 3-1, tonight in Canberra on a pair of goals by Sun Wen, the most valuable player in the 1999 Women's World Cup.</p>
        <p>Norway is the only team with a winning record against the Americans (14-13-2), and had defeated the United States three times in six matches this year. Tonight, however, the Norwegians seemed to lack enthusiasm, their play as dreary as the soggy turf. Milbrett repeatedly exploited seams in their flat-back four defense, turning and shooting insistently without obstruction.</p>
        <p>A year ago, Milbrett had seemed tense and hesitant in the opening match of the World Cup. Tonight, she felt free, unrestricted; she danced in the locker room before the match. Then she played with her own dazzling, improvisational rhythm, even if it felt like performing in an echo chamber with only 16,043 spectators in the 95,000 seats at Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you've got to quit listening to coaches,'' Milbrett said. ''I don't mean that in a bad way. You're the one out there playing the game. You got yourself to this level. If you forget that, sometimes you start struggling. In the past, I was worried about what my coaches and teammates thought. I got to the point where I said, 'It's time to get back to listening to me.' ''</p>
        <p>In the 18th minute, goalkeeper Siri Mullinix played with the assertive roaming that has come to characterize her style, racing to the top of the penalty box and clearing a ball 60 yards downfield to a sprinting Milbrett. It was Mullinix's first start in a major tournament, and she sometimes seemed overly aggressive in straying off her line. But she did collect her 14th shutout of the year, a team record. And, on the first goal, she sent her long clearance with such precision that Milbrett ran onto the ball at full speed.</p>
        <p>Heading the ball forward, Milbrett rushed past two defenders and punched a shot at the Norwegian goalkeeper, Bente Nordby, who could not control the rebound, leaving Milbrett with an unencumbered finish for a 1-0 lead. Norway left huge gaps through which Milbrett knifed with her searing first step, change of direction and spontaneity. At 5 feet 2 inches, she and China's Sun move more expertly in tight spaces than any players in the women's game.</p>
        <p>''Her agility and change of direction and change of speed and control of her body, I liken it to a point guard in basketball,'' Heinrichs said.</p>
        <p>Milbrett had felt shackled by DiCicco's more structured style, even though it brought the Americans an Olympic gold medal and a world championship. DiCicco felt that Milbrett was not sufficiently fit. Heinrichs, a former star forward on the national team, does not yell from the sideline and does not insist on an unbending plan of attack.</p>
        <p>Said defender Kate Sobrero: ''April said, 'Do whatever you want, I'm not going to yell. Just get the ball on frame.' ''</p>
        <p>Hamm beat the offside trap for the second goal, taking a chip pass from Kristine Lilly and driving it beneath a diving Nordby for her 126th international goal, unsurpassed by any man or woman. It has been Hamm's history to score in early matches of major tournaments, then to stop putting the ball into the net. Without the pressure of playing at home, as the Americans did in the 1996 Olympics and in the 1999 World Cup, perhaps she will be able to sustain her goal production throughout the tournament.</p>
        <p>''If she just plays for herself and doesn't worry about what anyone else is saying, she'll be fine,'' Milbrett said of Hamm.</p>
        <p>But it is Milbrett who appears to be on the verge of a breakthrough tournament and a chance to gain widespread attention, as well as a sense of true belonging on the American team.</p>
        <p>''It won't hurt if we come home with a gold medal,'' she said.</p>
