        <p>Not only was Filip Novak the biggest surprise of Rangers training camp, but he also turned out to be the most surprised player when he learned this morning he would accompany the team to New York instead of returning to Regina, Saskatchewan, to rejoin his junior league team.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Low told me that I was probably going to leave, but that I had a great camp,'' Novak said, referring to Coach Ron Low. ''And then, there was my name. Surprise! I was ready to leave for Regina yesterday.''</p>

        <p>Not only was Filip Novak the biggest surprise of Rangers training camp, but he also turned out to be the most surprised player when he learned this morning he would accompany the team to New York instead of returning to Regina, Saskatchewan, to rejoin his junior league team.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Low told me that I was probably going to leave, but that I had a great camp,'' Novak said, referring to Coach Ron Low. ''And then, there was my name. Surprise! I was ready to leave for Regina yesterday.''</p>
        <p>Instead, Novak, 18, a Czech-born defenseman who is 6 feet and 174 pounds, will get a chance to impress coaches again in preseason games, the first of which will be Saturday afternoon at Philadelphia. ''I don't even mention him among the people who impressed me most here this week, because I didn't think he was going to be here after today,'' Low said. ''He's likely been the biggest surprise of all. He's surprised us so much that he's going back with us.''</p>
        <p>Novak was the Rangers' first selection in last summer's draft, the 64th pick over all. Asked why Novak was still available, the assistant general manager Don Maloney said: ''It's a size issue. That's all it is. Everybody looks big before they look hockey player. And Filip's a very good hockey player. But he's not 6 foot 3.'' Novak makes up for his lack of size with skill and smarts. ''He's deceptively strong; he has outstanding skating ability and vision,'' Maloney said. ''He's not a weak 6-footer and he's obviously going to get bigger. He's really opened some eyes so far. He's earned his right to come to New York. We'll see what he does.''</p>
        <p>Novak is still a long shot to make the team, however.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to believe that somebody that size can play in the N.H.L. with zero experience, but he's been a treat to watch,'' Low said.</p>
        <p>Manny Malhotra has also had a strong camp.</p>
        <p>''I'm a little more into it this year,'' Malhotra said this morning. ''I'm back to playing simple hockey and playing physically.'' Slowly but surely, the confidence that drained from Malhotra last season is returning. ''By playing -- and playing regularly -- it comes,'' said Malhotra, a 20-year-old center.</p>
        <p>Pavel Brendl and Jamie Lundmark, the Rangers' two first-round draft choices last season, seem to be struggling. Brendl, who was drafted because of his ability to score goals, did not score in a scrimmage. He has tried to show the Rangers that he can do other things, like back check, pass and be responsible defensively. The Rangers have been impressed with Brendl's effort and work ethic but they wouldn't mind seeing him score some goals, too.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if I've seen the kid get six or seven shots in the five days that we were here,'' Low said of Brendl, a 19-year-old left wing. ''And he's had the puck in scoring situations where he's elected to pass. He's worked hard, though, so we'll see.''</p>
        <p>Lundmark has not returned to top form after he missed the last half of his junior season in 1999 with a broken bone in his right wrist. ''He missed the last three months of a season and that's a huge development year for you,'' Low said. It has shown this fall. During Wednesday night's blue-white scrimmage, in which the blue team defeated Lundmark's white team, 5-2, Lundmark had a plus-minus rating of minus-five, meaning he was on the ice for all of the blue team's goals.</p>
        <p>''I really didn't like his game last night,'' Low said. ''The blue team also had two disallowed goals and he was on the ice for both of those, too. It was a little like Eeyore. There was a cloud hanging directly above Jamie's head and it wasn't moving. But he's going to be all right.''</p>
        <p>It might take another year of junior league seasoning for Lundmark, a 19-year-old center, to be ready for the National Hockey League. And Brendl is no lock to make the team, either. What a difference from last season, when Brendl and Lundmark were all that anyone wanted to talk about. Now they are scarcely mentioned unless an interviewer brings them up, and that is almost certainly by design under the new regime.</p>
        <p>As Low put it today, ''I don't think they need any extra pressure on them.''</p>
