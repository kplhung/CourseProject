        <p>Gov. George W. Bush quickly turned a news report that raised fresh questions about Vice President Al Gore's fund-raising efforts into a bludgeon against Mr. Gore today, saying the vice president ''may have crossed a serious line.''</p>
        <p>''The appearance is really disturbing,'' Mr. Bush said in a speech to a convention of National Guard members. His remarks about the vice president's ethics were decidedly more forceful than his standard fare.</p>
        <p>''Americans are tired of investigations and scandals,'' Mr. Bush added. ''And the best way to get rid of them is to elect a new president, who will bring a new administration, who will restore honor and dignity to the White House.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was referring to an article on Thursday in The New York Times that reported the Justice Department had started a preliminary investigation into the manner in which Democrats raised money from trial lawyers in 1995 and 1996.</p>
        <p>The article noted the existence of a memorandum that suggested a link between Democrats' solicitation of contributions from trial lawyers and President Clinton's veto of legislation that would have significantly curbed the size of the financial judgments that juries can award in civil cases.</p>
        <p>The article also established Mr. Gore's role in nurturing the relationship between the Democratic Party and a group of wealthy Texas lawyers who are the subjects of the investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush made a point of referring to the situation at his first campaign event today, the speech to the National Guard members. Although their conference was in Atlantic City, Mr. Bush spoke to them by satellite feed from Newport Beach, Calif.</p>
        <p>Most of his speech was about the need to strengthen the military, but Mr. Bush fashioned a transition near the end into Mr. Gore's fund-raising efforts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he would not only ''renew the bond of trust'' between the president and people in the military, but also ''restore the bond of trust between the president and all Americans.''</p>
        <p>''Just today,'' Mr. Bush continued, ''there are new revelations about the potential misuse of the White House for fund-raising purposes, new evidence that my opponent may have crossed a serious line -- solicitation of campaign contributions linked to a presidential veto. The appearance is really disturbing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's use -- twice -- of the word ''restore'' was a telling measure of his eagerness, after several weeks on the defensive, to put Mr. Gore in a similar position.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush usually says that he wants to ''uphold'' the honor and dignity of the presidency, and his occasional use of ''restore'' became the centerpiece of a news conference several weeks ago, at which reporters noted that the latter word was much more loaded. Mr. Bush said  there was no special intent behind it.</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said today that Mr. Bush's remarks represented ''the fact that George W. Bush and the Republicans are resorting back to Rule No. 1 of the Republican playbook: attack, attack, attack.''</p>
        <p>''The governor's comments were desperate words from a desperate candidate who is mired in a desperate campaign with declining poll numbers,'' Mr. Lehane said.</p>
        <p>After addressing the National Guard, Mr. Bush visited a high school in Santa Ana to talk about education, an issue that he hopes will appeal to California voters.</p>
