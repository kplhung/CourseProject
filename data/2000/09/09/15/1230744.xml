        <p>A Brooklyn elementary school was evacuated yesterday after a small bottle containing the pesticide malathion shattered inside a janitor's closet in a second-grade classroom, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of students were led out of the school, Public School 21 in Ocean Hill, and 10 children and 3 adults were taken to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, where they were treated for nausea and released, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>The Board of Education is investigating why the pesticide was on a shelf at the school, at 180 Chauncey Street, north of Fulton Street, said a spokeswoman, Margie Feinberg.</p>
        <p>''We don't know how it got there or why it was in the closet, and the superintendent has launched a major investigation into it,'' Ms. Feinberg said. ''That insecticide is not permitted anywhere inside our school facilities.''</p>
        <p>The bottle held 10 ounces of malathion. It fell and broke when a teacher opened the closet door. Noting that the spill was small, a spokeswoman for the City Health Department, Sandra Mullin, said serious health risks were unlikely.</p>
