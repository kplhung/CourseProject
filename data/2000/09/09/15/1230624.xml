        <p>As booming economies around the world fuel the consumption of luxury goods, some of Europe's biggest retailers of luxury goods are reporting strong gains in sales and profits.</p>
        <p>The leading luxury goods retailer, LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton of France, reported today that operating profit in the first half of the year rose 31 percent, to 762 million euros, or about $655 million, on a 40 percent increase in sales, to 5.03 billion euros.</p>
        <p>The group attributed the result to particularly strong increases in sales of leather goods and perfumes, including Christian Dior's J'Adore, introduced earlier this year in the United States. But ''global economic growth has certainly contributed to these developments,'' it said. Net profit rose 21 percent in the first half, to 374 million euros.</p>
        <p>At the same time, another of Europe's biggest specialty retailers, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute of France, said first-half operating profit rose 35 percent, to 791.1 million euros, on an 8 percent increase in revenue, to 11.3 billion euros. The gain was aided by strong consumer buying in France and the good performance of the Gucci Group, in which Pinault owns a 42 percent share. Pinault said net income rose 23 percent to 20.6 million euros.</p>
        <p>Pinault, controlled by the French billionaire Francois Pinault, entered the luxury business in a big way last year, after winning a drawn-out battle with Vuitton for control of Gucci. Vuitton, controlled by another French billionaire, Bernard Arnault, a rival of sorts to Mr. Pinault, owns a 20 percent share of Gucci, but management control rests with Pinault. Since the acquisition, Gucci has used the roughly $3 billion it received from Pinault for a campaign of high-profile acquisitions that has included Yves Saint Laurent, the French fashion house, and Sergio Rossi, an Italian maker of shoes for the wealthy.</p>
        <p>Vuitton's strong results were also reflected in the return to profitability of the DFS Group, which is 61 percent controlled by Vuitton.</p>
        <p>DFS operates duty-free shops at major airports and had suffered after the Asian economic crisis caused the usually free-spending travelers from Japan and other East Asian countries to cut their airport shopping.</p>
