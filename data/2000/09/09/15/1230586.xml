        <p>Opinion now seems to be divided on whether this is the 400th anniversary of the birth of Claude Lorrain (as one would suppose from the inscription on his gravestone in Rome). But the chance to see nearly 40 of his drawings and eight of his etchings at the Pierpont Morgan Library is always timely.</p>
        <p>It was Pierpont Morgan himself who set the tone for Claude drawings in 1910, when he bought the large group that, in part, has prompted the library's present show, ''Claude and the Ideal Landscape.'' Among much else he bought the ''Landscape With Aeneas Landing at Carthage,'' which relates to the grand passion for Virgil that powered many of Claude's finest paintings in his later years. (He died in 1682.) Morgan also bought a drawing for Claude's ''Sermon on the Mount,'' a painting acquired by the Frick Collection in 1960.</p>

        <p>Opinion now seems to be divided on whether this is the 400th anniversary of the birth of Claude Lorrain (as one would suppose from the inscription on his gravestone in Rome). But the chance to see nearly 40 of his drawings and eight of his etchings at the Pierpont Morgan Library is always timely.</p>
        <p>It was Pierpont Morgan himself who set the tone for Claude drawings in 1910, when he bought the large group that, in part, has prompted the library's present show, ''Claude and the Ideal Landscape.'' Among much else he bought the ''Landscape With Aeneas Landing at Carthage,'' which relates to the grand passion for Virgil that powered many of Claude's finest paintings in his later years. (He died in 1682.) Morgan also bought a drawing for Claude's ''Sermon on the Mount,'' a painting acquired by the Frick Collection in 1960.</p>
        <p>The show owes much to loans from two holdings: the Thaw Collection of the Morgan Library and the estate of  Peter Jay Sharp.</p>
        <p>A good case can be made for the variety and the versatility of Claude's ambitions. There are preliminary drawings for paintings, like the ''Aeneas Hunting'' now in the Musee des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, and the ''David With Three Heroes,'' now in the National Gallery in London.</p>
        <p>There are souvenirs of the excursions that Claude, a French expatriate artist who spent most of his life in Rome, made to the Italian countryside, often with painter friends. It was one of his colleagues on these country walks, a German named Joachim von Sandrart, who left us the most convincing account of how Claude actually went to work: ordering the given landscape with total clarity and ''bringing everything together in correct harmony by accentuating the front strongly and shading off the back in proportion.'' This we can see for ourselves at the Morgan Library.</p>
        <p>The show offers some telling examples of Claude's interest in animals. There was, in fact, a so-called ''Animal Album'' by Claude, which was kept in a Roman family for generations until it was sold at auction in 1957. In particular, he was fascinated by cows and is said to have made some 50 drawings of them.</p>
        <p>That the relationship between the herdsman and his beasts was one that Claude studied with great tenderness is clear here from the monumental drawing of two men tending an ox, which comes from the Thaw Collection. Claude did more for the cow and the ox with pen and ink than he normally did for human beings.</p>
        <p>There is a sparkling little drawing of the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli, which was a favorite destination for painters who wanted a day out in what was then unspoiled country. Claude delighted in the Temple and often used it to stand in for antiquity. And there are drawings of unaccompanied travelers to remind us that making one's way on foot among rocky hillsides in the late afternoon could be a very lonely business.</p>
        <p>It was often held against Claude that he had no gift for portraying the human figure. In the big paintings of his maturity this mattered less, because the human figure was incidental. What mattered were the sky, the sea, the splendid trees, sometimes the ships, and the carefully fabricated architecture. The people were tiny stock figures who came with gestures to match. If they gave any trouble, perspective could fix it.</p>
        <p>In his drawings Claude carries us away by his skill with trees, with water, with the movement of the light and with his mastery of complicated textures. His ''David and the Three Heroes'' here is a capital example. It is done with ''brush and brown wash over black and red chalk, heightened with white body color, on paper tinted with brown wash,'' as the text panel explains. Claude did his very best, and the four figures have the makings of a heroic group. But it doesn't quite come off as a momentous occasion.</p>
        <p>Claude lived in Rome for many years, but he does not seem to have been a big-city man at heart. If his subject called for a city, he made one up from bits and pieces of antiquity. This show does, however, have a ''View of Santa Maria del Popolo.'' The view has the charm of some cows in the foreground. As he lived in the Via Margutta, the church was an easy walk away, just beyond the city walls, and the view was not cluttered with men and women.</p>
        <p>The eight etchings in the show are on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which has been acquiring Claude's etchings since 1917 and now owns 30.</p>
        <p>One of the most curious items is the print called ''Time, Apollo and the Seasons.'' This is said to be related to Poussin's ''Dance to the Music of Time'' in the Wallace Collection in London. As the Poussin is one of the most beautiful pictures ever painted, this is great company. But Claude's image, though undeniably curious, does not in any respect keep company with Poussin's.</p>
        <p>Claude's is undeniably rather droll. Apollo leads four none too stable women across some tricky ground toward a rather daunting figure of Time. Given the multiple overtones of the Poussin, and his incomparable handling of the subject, there really can be no comparison.</p>
        <p>But in his drawings Claude did not aim to tell a story or to deal in depth with human nature. He just had to sit down and watch Nature at her work. His eye and his hand did the rest. For proof we have only to see the little ''Tiber Landscape'' here. The river, its banks and the big blue sky -- all are touched in to perfection. It is done with almost nothing, and it has no particular incident. Yet the Tiber is all there, with nothing unsaid.</p>
        <p>This is the Claude who would one day send John Keats into ecstasy (so people said) with his great painting ''The Enchanted Castle.''</p>
        <p>''Claude and the Ideal Landscape'' is at the Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-0008, through Oct. 29.</p>
