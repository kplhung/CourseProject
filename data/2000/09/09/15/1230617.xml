        <p>THE big news in Detroit in 1960 was the arrival of the Big Three's first compact cars: the Chevrolet Corvair, Ford Falcon and Plymouth Valiant. But a truly tiny car, the Mini, arrived in the United States that year, and it has proved to be much more significant.</p>
        <p>The Mini, which appeared as Austin and Morris models in Europe in 1959, has been built continuously in England until this month, with 5.3 million made.

        <p>THE big news in Detroit in 1960 was the arrival of the Big Three's first compact cars: the Chevrolet Corvair, Ford Falcon and Plymouth Valiant. But a truly tiny car, the Mini, arrived in the United States that year, and it has proved to be much more significant.</p>
        <p>The Mini, which appeared as Austin and Morris models in Europe in 1959, has been built continuously in England until this month, with 5.3 million made. It foreshadowed the wave of econoboxes in the 1970's and 80's, and its front-drive configuration, with the engine mounted sideways for space efficiency, remains widely copied today.</p>
        <p>In designing the Mini, Sir Alec Issigonis achieved his goal of devoting 80 percent of the car's space to passengers and just 20 percent to mechanical components. Because the layout allowed no room for a driveshaft, Sir Alec placed the 850 cc, 4-cylinder engine -- and the 4-speed gearbox -- above the driving wheels. The gearbox and engine shared the same lubricating oil, causing Mini owners to pay particular attention to the intervals between oil changes.</p>
        <p>Another unusual feature was a suspension of rubber cones, designed by Alex Moulton, instead of coil or leaf springs. He later experimented with a hydrolastic suspension that used rubber containers at each corner, connected by tubes filled with liquid.</p>
        <p>The Mini was withdrawn from the American market in 1968 as safety and emissions standards were tightened. The car was gone by the time Japanese imitators flooded the market. (Interestingly, the Mini's hottest market in recent years has been Japan.)</p>
        <p>Even three decades after Minis were last imported, American collectors prize them. ''Minis are sports cars in a box,'' said Don Racine, owner of Mini Mania in Milpitas, Calif. ''They are every bit as impressive to drive as an open-top classic sports car.'' Because they are highly maneuverable, ''you can dart in and out of traffic like you wouldn't believe,'' Mr. Racine added.</p>
        <p>The 10-inch wheels that contributed to the toylike appearance also provided a low center of gravity. (Twelve-inch wheels became standard in 1974.) With the wheels at the corners, the Mini had a surefooted stance.</p>
        <p>Only 120 inches long at a time when American cars ranged up to 225 inches, the Mini could parallel-park in an 11.5-foot space, its manufacturer claimed.</p>
        <p>The car's sporting potential was clear by the early 60's, and reinforced when a Mini won the Monte Carlo rally in 1964 and '65. In 1961, John Cooper, a British race driver, created a special edition called the Mini Cooper, and in 1963, the higher-performing Cooper S. Bigger engines of 970, 1,071 and 1,275 cc's were available. The Coopers had twin carburetors, front disc brakes, a shorter shift lever, higher gearing and wider tires. Through 1971, 45,438 Cooper S's were built; they are the most desirable Minis.</p>
        <p>Original cars are rare; as inexpensive sports cars, most were driven hard, then fell into disrepair. Most Minis were sold as economy cars and are still seen as such in Britain. But here, Mr. Racine said, ''they have become a means of self-expression, and everyone personalizes or customizes them.''</p>
        <p>During the 60's, rock stars like Paul McCartney were seen driving Minis. Peter Sellers had his customized by Hooper &amp; Company, a London coachbuilder for Rolls-Royce.</p>
        <p>In 1960, the Mini sold for $1,295, weighed 1,288 pounds and went 45 miles to the gallon. Standard equipment included a rear-view mirror, sliding side windows, rubber mats, driver's sunvisor, bucket seats and cloth upholstery. An option package offered windshield washers, foam-rubber seats, wheel trim, hinged rear side windows, passenger sunvisor and chromed license plate light.</p>
        <p>In addition to the two-door, four-passenger sedan, there was a station wagon, including a ''woodie,'' and a pickup. There have been slight changes over the years: exposed door hinges gave way to internal hinges, for example -- and purists countered with kits to retrofit the old hinges.</p>
        <p>Today, Minis are treated as collectibles in the United States. A highly restored Mini Cooper sold for $20,900 last month at an auction in Monterey, Calif. ''They're a complicated car to make right,'' said Brian Ross, a restorer in Portland, Ore. ''But properly put together, a Mini Cooper S will let you terrorize modern Japanese 'pocket rockets.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Racine said there were far more 1960-67 Minis left in the United States than in England, where they rusted badly in the damp climate. ''Here they are absolute collector cars,'' Mr. Racine said. ''In England, they are still daily transportation.''</p>
