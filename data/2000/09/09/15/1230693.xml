        <p>Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County executive, has been loath to propose an increase in county property taxes over the last several years. On Friday, he will.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Mr. Gulotta, a Republican in his third term, has overestimated sales tax revenues, underbudgeted overtime costs for county employees and relied on so-called one-shot deals like the sale of county land or property to balance his budget.</p>
        <p>This year, because his budgeting practices have helped push the county to the brink of bankruptcy, Mr. Gulotta, whose political career has been jeopardized, has been forced to abandon those tactics and take up others that he has long avoided, like raising taxes and laying off county workers.</p>
        <p>Even so, some critics and observers say, in the preliminary numbers and budget plans that Mr. Gulotta has presented so far -- the draft blueprint of the final budget documents due Friday -- he has still indulged in part in what they call ''Gulotta-nomics'': spinning numbers without providing enough specifics for others to tell whether they add up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta is to submit his full plan on Friday for a balanced budget for 2001 and three subsequent years to county lawmakers and the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, the state board overseeing the county's finances. But some of those officials are skeptical that he will meet the mandate to balance the books that was laid out by state officials when they agreed in May to help rescue the county.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to compare one budget to another,'' Mr. Gulotta said of his 2001 budget in an interview today. ''This is a responsible fiscal document that cuts significant government spending and offers realistic budget projections.''</p>
        <p>He said criticisms that his draft plan lacked detail were unfair, and that his final plan would answer all questions. But county legislative leaders in both parties say that Mr. Gulotta's plan may force them to make the hardest decisions about budget cuts and new revenues. The Democrats are considering an even higher tax increase than the 4 percent rise Mr. Gulotta has proposed.</p>
        <p>''The county executive is acting in the same way he has in the past,'' said H. Carl McCall, the Democratic state comptroller, who appointed one of the seven members of the state oversight board. ''We have not seen a full-blown plan. We have seen pieces of a plan and we have heard promises that the plan is on the way. That is not good enough.''</p>
        <p>Judith A. Jacobs, the Democratic majority leader of the County Legislature, said that so far she could see some differences between Mr. Gulotta's draft budget for 2001 and his  budget submissions from past years.</p>
        <p>''A 4 percent tax increase is different,'' she said. ''Other parts of his submission are typical Gulotta, where it is undocumented and unsubstantiated.''</p>
        <p>Peter J. Schmitt, a Republican and the minority leader of the County Legislature, said Mr. Gulotta seemed to have more realistic plans for generating revenue than in the past. It is the cuts that worry Mr. Schmitt, particularly Mr. Gulotta's proposed layoffs of more than 300 county workers. Mr. Schmitt said that Mr. Gulotta's draft budget did not seem to address the potential loss of county services, and of revenue collected by some workers.</p>
        <p>County legislators also said that Mr. Gulotta had not provided enough  detail about the impact of his proposed contract settlements with unions for county police officers, detectives and correction officers.  They said they had difficulty trying to reconcile how a proposed $20 million in union concessions could be realized while the proposed contracts included 22 percent in pay raises for police officers and detectives and nearly 30 percent for correction officers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta insisted that the union concessions would be much larger than the pay raises.</p>
        <p>Legislators have also said that Mr. Gulotta has been vague about his proposed savings, even up until the final hours, as he has been in the past. For instance, they do not yet know which workers will be laid off and how that will affect government.</p>
        <p>''The cornerstone of Gulotta-nomics in the past was a reliance on one-shots, overly generous projections of revenues and irresponsible assumptions of expenses,'' Darren Bloch, chief of staff of the Democratic legislators, said. ''At least in this plan some of that is gone. But what remains are statements of expense reductions without saying how you will achieve them.''</p>
