        <p>A blockade of British refineries and storage depots broke up today and oil trucks rumbled past company gates unimpeded for the first time in a week. But Prime Minister Tony Blair warned there was still ''some way to go'' before most drivers would see gas back in their neighborhood pumps.</p>
        <p>The signal that the hastily organized but remarkably effective countrywide protest of high fuel prices was coming to an end was a 5 a.m. statement from the movement's instigator, Brynle Williams, that he was shutting down the vigil at the Shell refinery in Stanlow in northwest England, where the protest began seven days ago. He urged others to follow suit.</p>
        <p>Hours after the Stanlow pickets were taken down, protesters did likewise at Grangemouth in Scotland, Cardiff in Wales, Jarrow in northeast England, Plymouth in southwest England, Avonmouth near Bristol and Trafford Park in Manchester. Pockets of resistance emerged elsewhere, but at noon Mr. Blair reported that 12 of the 20 main supply depots were operating freely.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams, a Welsh farmer who has become a practiced performer on British television this week, said he felt the siege should be lifted while it still occupied the ''high moral ground.'' He also indicated protesters feared further disruption would erode popular support for their cause. A BBC poll broadcast Wednesday said 80 percent of Britons supported the blockades despite the inconveniences caused by them.</p>
        <p>At a news conference today, his third in 48 hours, Mr. Blair acknowledged the depth of popular sentiment about high fuel costs and the widespread opposition over his tough stance against the demonstrators. Although the prime minister had been under tremendous political pressure to solve the strike, it appeared that the protesters ended it before Mr. Blair's Labor Party brought pressure to bear on them.  Mr. Blair, striking a less defiant note than in recent days, said: ''Whatever the strength of feeling on the price of petrol, I do hope that over time people will carefully reflect on recent events. However much people may dislike paying petrol duty, there's no way that any government of this country could or should yield to this form of protest.''</p>
        <p>He said the proper time to take up the matter of fuel taxes -- which account for three-quarters of the cost of gasoline -- was during the budget review in November and the presentation of the budget itself in March, and he suggested that his ministers would be meeting with some of the protest leaders before then.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams said he looked for a cut in taxes within the next 60 days in exchange for lifting the siege. He said he decided to call a halt ''after deep discussions and concerns among ourselves about the distress to the British public.'' Mr. Blair said on Wednesday night that the blockades were putting ''lives at risk'' by jeopardizing police and hospital activities, and he put the National Health Service on national disaster footing.</p>
        <p>The demonstrators have been picketing refineries and storage depots in protest of the high taxes that make Britain's gas the highest taxed and most expensive in Europe. Using e-mail and mobile telephones for coordination, the movement that succeeded in virtually paralyzing the entire country was mounted by a small number of truck owners, farmers and self-employed workers saying that rising fuel prices -- gasoline costs about $4.37 a gallon -- are putting them out of business.</p>
        <p>With almost all of Britain's 12,500 filling stations drained, returning supplies to normal is a ''massive logistical operation,'' according to the Petrol Retailers' Association. Less than 10 percent of normal supplies were on the move on Wednesday despite assurances of police protection for drivers. With emergency services getting the priority, it will take until Saturday to start getting fuel back in pumps and at least two weeks before the situation is back to normal.</p>
        <p>Two of Britain's major suppliers, Esso and TotalFinaElf, confirmed today that they were raising their prices on gas and diesel fuel despite the protests, provoking instant condemnation from Mr. Blair and motorists' organizations. Saying with some irritation that he ''really couldn't understand'' the decision, Mr. Blair told reporters, ''The world oil price as far as I'm aware has actually gone down in the last few days.''  Later, after a meeting he held with oil company heads, Esso withdrew the planned hike, saying, ''We recognize that the timing is regrettable.''</p>
        <p>TotalFinaElf stuck to its rise, while Shell and BP said they would hold to present prices and absorb losses from recent days.</p>
        <p>Vincent Burke, a spokesman for the London Chamber of Commerce, said the protests were costing Britain $350 million each day, roughly one-tenth of the national daily economic output.</p>
        <p>One victim of the fuel shortage was Prince Charles, who canceled public appearances touring farms in southwest England rather than accept an offer of gasoline from police. ''He didn't think he was an emergency service,'' a spokeswoman said.</p>

        <p>Protests Flare Across Europe  BRUSSELS, Sept. 14  Reuters</p>
        <p>Belgian truckers agreed today to end a five-day fuel tax protest that brought chaos throughout the country, but elsewhere across Europe fresh unrest flared.</p>
        <p>Three Belgian truckers' unions, whose members blocked motorways, ports, frontiers and oil depots, accepted measures proposed by the government to help offset recent fuel price rises and said they would end their blockades at midnight.</p>
        <p>But in Germany, oil refineries were hit for the first time with protests. Up to 1,000 truckers and farmers jammed traffic in the northern city of Hanover, and another 400 vehicles brought the center of Magdeburg to a standstill. Protests also erupted in Spain, Sweden, Greece and the Netherlands. In Ireland, protests were to start at midnight.</p>
