        <p>Angry shouts erupted from the showers after the Yankees' extra-inning loss to Toronto last night, the raging voice belonging to catcher Jorge Posada. He was infuriated by the decision of a team official to allow reporters into the clubhouse about five minutes sooner than usual. If not the breach of protocol, something else probably would have ignited Posada's kindling emotions.</p>
        <p>He struck out to finish a tense game that began with David Wells and Andy Pettitte locked into a scoreless duel, and ended after a bounce of the ball went against the Yankees in the ninth inning and Toronto's Jose Cruz Jr. ripped a two-run homer off the rookie Randy Choate in the 11th.</p>

        <p>Angry shouts erupted from the showers after the Yankees' extra-inning loss to Toronto last night, the raging voice belonging to catcher Jorge Posada. He was infuriated by the decision of a team official to allow reporters into the clubhouse about five minutes sooner than usual. If not the breach of protocol, something else probably would have ignited Posada's kindling emotions.</p>
        <p>He struck out to finish a tense game that began with David Wells and Andy Pettitte locked into a scoreless duel, and ended after a bounce of the ball went against the Yankees in the ninth inning and Toronto's Jose Cruz Jr. ripped a two-run homer off the rookie Randy Choate in the 11th.</p>
        <p>The Blue Jays' Kelvim Escobar allowed a solo homer to Ryan Thompson in the bottom of the 11th, but closed out the 3-2 victory at Yankee Stadium that kept Toronto on the fringes of the wild-card race and prevented a Yankees sweep.</p>
        <p>The Yankees (84-60) will begin a four-game series against the Cleveland Indians tonight, and in the big picture, all is well. They lead the American League East by eight games over the Boston Red Sox, and their pitching has been so extraordinary that they haven't allowed three or more runs in an inning since Aug. 29 -- a streak that spans 136 innings.</p>
        <p>And yet for one game on one night, their old pal Wells offset Pettitte's strong stuff for eight innings, even if he wasn't able to pick up his 20th victory of the season. ''A lot of times you have pitching duels advertised, and it doesn't live up to its billing, but tonight it did,'' said Derek Jeter, who had four hits.</p>
        <p>The old school rules regarding decorum among competitors will never apply to Wells, who rarely passes on a chance for conversation. Posada jogged to left-center field to stretch before last night's game and tried to keep his distance from Wells, with whom he shared a perfect game in 1998. Lying on his back and stretching, Wells shouted something to Posada, and Posada burst out laughing, and they continued their banter. Wells began throwing in a part of the outfield usually inhabited by a Yankee pitcher and catcher.</p>
        <p>When Pettitte marched past, he glanced only once at Wells before moving on sternly to the bullpen. Pettitte would've been a perfect hall monitor in high school, completely trustworthy. Wells assuredly was a hall monitor's worst nightmare at San Diego's Point Loma High.</p>
        <p>Pettitte, pitching for his 19th victory, was exceptional, allowing three hits and one walk in the first seven innings, facing only four batters over the minimum, but gained no edge: Wells shut out the Yankees through seven innings, as well, scattering seven hits, aided a bit when Posada made a base-running mistake in the fifth.</p>
        <p>Craig Grebeck doubled to lead off the eighth and was replaced by the speedy pinch-runner Dewayne Wise. Alberto Castillo bunted the ball back to Pettitte, who rushed to field the ball and throw to third; Pettitte explained later that when he looked at the base, he realized he had far more time than he expected. The surprise seized him, and he threw the ball far out of the reach of third baseman Scott Brosius, and Wise scored.</p>
        <p>Six outs from beating the Yankees for the second time this season, Wells retired the first two batters in the bottom of the eighth. But Jeter slammed a home run to straightaway center field, tying the score. Neither Wells nor Pettitte would be involved in the decision.</p>
        <p>The Toronto closer Billy Koch took over in the ninth and the Yankees had runners at first and second and two out. Brosius hit a ball sharply up the middle. When Brosius made contact, he was sure it was the game-winning hit.</p>
        <p>But it took a funny hop, skipping high into the air and landing near second base, so that the shortstop Alex Gonzalez was able to field the ball and throw out Brosius.</p>
        <p>''What did it hit?'' Brosius demanded of the first base coach Lee Mazzilli once he crossed the bag, and it wasn't until later, when Brosius looked at videotape, that he discovered the ball had hit the lip of the grass in front of home plate.</p>
        <p>Mike Stanton relieved in the eighth, Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth, and Jeff Nelson too over in the 10th.</p>
        <p>In the 11th, the bench coach Don Zimmer -- filling in for Joe Torre, who was ejected after arguing a call in the eighth -- turned to the left-handed specialist Randy Choate.</p>
        <p>Carlos Delgado hit a soft liner over short to open the 11th. Tony Batista and Brad Fullmer hit deep fly balls, but both were outs, bringing Cruz to the plate.</p>
        <p>The Toronto center fielder ripped a fastball high and far down the left-field line -- and foul.</p>
        <p>Choate spun a slider and later, he second-guess himself for throwing the ball over the plate; he should've put it in the dirt, he said.</p>
        <p>But Cruz crushed it for a two-run homer, his 30th of the season. As Choate searched for answers underneath a towel on the Yankees' bench in the bottom of the 11th, Ryan Thompson slammed a solo homer off Escobar.</p>
        <p>Toronto Manager Jim Fregosi went to the mound and waved his right hand.</p>
        <p>''That home run doesn't mean anything,'' he told Escobar. ''You're the best.''</p>
        <p>And Escobar struck out Posada to end the game. After his clubhouse explosion, Posada's face was taut with frustration and he did not stop to answer questions as he usually does.</p>
        <p>The playoffs are just around the corner. It feels like it, too.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>BERNIE WILLIAMS likely will sit out a few more games after feeling pain in his right side while taking batting practice left-handed Wednesday. ''If I can take anything positive from this,'' Williams said, ''at least it's not some injury where I'd be done for the season. At least it's something that I can work through. At least I know that when the time arrives, if it's not completely better, I could take some pain killers and play through it. It's a pain in the ribs.'' Said JOE TORRE: ''He's not quite ready. It's almost there.'' . . . DAVID CONE will pitch tonight against Cleveland in his first outing since dislocating his left, non-throwing shoulder Sept. 5. . . . Right fielder PAUL O'NEILL, who has been bothered by a right hip pointer, also is hampered by a sore toe. Torre wanted to give him last night's game off and bypassed a couple of situations when he might have used O'Neill as a pinch-hitter. Torre said after the game that he expects O'Neill will play tonight against the Indians.</p>
