        <p>Motorola said yesterday that it had consolidated its global advertising, with billings estimated at $150 million, by naming Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide in New York, part of the WPP Group, to handle those duties.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Weyrauch, a spokeswoman for Motorola in Schaumburg, Ill., said the decision came after a two-month review that had been limited to Ogilvy and two roster agencies: McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide unit of the B Com3  Group.</p>

        <p>Since 1997, McCann had handled Motorola's consumer advertising -- the bulk of the account, estimated at $100 million -- and Burnett had handled products like semiconductors. The Ogilvy interactive unit, Ogilvy One, had handled the interactive account since earlier this year.</p>
