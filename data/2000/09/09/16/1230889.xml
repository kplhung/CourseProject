        <p>The International Monetary Fund approved a plan today to overhaul its loan programs and keep more money available for emergencies, a victory for Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, who had been pushing for the changes since late last year.</p>
        <p>The global lending agency, based in Washington, will charge higher interest rates and limit the duration of many loans, while discouraging repeat borrowers from relying on the fund for routine aid. The idea is to make certain that plenty of money is on hand to shore up financial systems in emerging markets when panic strikes, as it did in much of the developing world in 1997 and 1998.</p>
        <p>Some poor nations had resisted the changes. Several delegates to the monetary fund from developing countries have said they feared losing access to the money the fund makes available for medium- and long-term programs aimed at helping nations set up Western-style capital markets or make their currencies fully convertible.</p>
        <p>Just last month, the fund's board rejected the same changes in an informal vote, delivering a rare rebuff to the United States, its largest shareholder. But Mr. Summers lobbied other wealthy nations and some major developing countries and persuaded enough board members to reverse that result, people involved in the vote said.</p>
        <p>While the overhaul approved today eliminates four lending programs outright and makes several others less attractive to borrowers, the changes preserve the fund's role as a medium-term and, in special cases, long-term lender.</p>
        <p>And the fund's antipoverty programs will continue much as before, despite some discussion of eliminating it as largely ineffective and redundant with programs directed by the World Bank, its sister agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Summers has said that investment from private sources so dwarfs official lending in normal times that the fund should keep its resources ready for those rare occasions when private investors lose confidence and stop lending or investing abroad. Those are the times when official lending can make the difference between a mild recession and an economic collapse, he has said.</p>
        <p>''This is very much in line with our emphasis throughout the year on the importance of reforming the I.M.F. to ensure that its role is to support, rather than supplant, private capital markets,'' Mr. Summers said. ''We believe these steps go a long way toward creating a more modern I.M.F., one better focused on responding to financial emergencies.''</p>
        <p>The overhaul falls short of the radical revamping demanded by some of the monetary fund's loudest opponents. Many critics say the fund often seeks to interfere too much in the domestic affairs of borrower nations, while some have accused the fund of ignoring or even fostering corruption in places like Russia.</p>
        <p>One Congressional study of the fund recommended that it cease medium- and long-term lending altogether, and limit its role to providing emergency financing to nations that have good track records of sound macroeconomic management. Monetary fund officials have said that changes of that nature would essentially obliterate its role.</p>
        <p>The streamlining endorsed today did not go so far. But it did give Mr. Summers ammunition to argue that he had achieved notable results in his push to improve the monetary fund, potentially helping fend off some members of Congress who have demanded a complete rethinking of the fund's mission.</p>
        <p>It was unclear today if the overhaul would persuade Congress to release more money for another major Clinton administration priority, debt relief for developing nations. Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, has held up money for debt relief, part of which comes from monetary fund coffers, until the fund agrees to changes that are more sweeping than those announced today.</p>
        <p>The fund is considering other ways to make itself more efficient and more responsive to critics. Horst Kohler, the monetary fund's new managing director, plans to disclose his own overhaul plan during the Prague summit meeting of world financial leaders next week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohler, a former German government minister who took over at the fund last spring, has said he intends to persuade the fund's board to reduce the conditions it attaches to its lending. That would hold the potential for giving borrowing nations more input and control of lending programs.</p>
        <p>The fund did not provide details of how it intended to restructure lending programs. But Mr. Summers told reporters that the fund would cut the length of time a country could borrow under its core lending fund to a range of two and a quarter years to 4 years. That is down from a range of three and a quarter years to 5 years. The fund will also reduce the duration of its longest-term loans to 7 years from 10 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Summers did not say how the fund would put higher interest rates into effect. But fund officials said the rates would rise with the size of a loan and be structured to encourage early repayment.</p>
        <p>The poorest countries, most of them in Africa, will be spared the brunt of the overhaul. They will not have to pay more for loans from the fund or pay back the loans sooner, Mr. Summers said.</p>
