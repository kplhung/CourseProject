        <p>The campaign bus he calls the Mainstream Express displays fresh detailing -- not to mention, finally, New York plates to replace the Alabama ones that reflected its owner's roots.</p>
        <p>At campaign stops the stereo now blasts hipper acts like Fatboy Slim, mixed in with the usual 70's rock.</p>
        <p>And Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, is more energetic than he has been in weeks. Today, he playfully shook hands with a line of cheerleaders at a high school here in Suffolk County, flashing a grin and saying, ''I wish I were in high school again'' before he bounded into the school and took question after question from students and teachers.</p>
        <p>It would be a stretch to say Mr. Lazio's campaign underwent an overnight makeover after reports that politicians and even his aides (perhaps to nudge him publicly) were discouraged by what they felt was his lackluster campaign style of late. But clearly Mr. Lazio, whether in response to party leaders' complaints, or by design, or riding a high from a first campaign debate his staff believes he aced, has stepped up the vigor of his schedule.</p>
        <p>Campaign officials say that, more so than in June or July, he will be willing to skip House votes in Washington that he deems not crucial, calculating that the November election overrides the inevitable criticism from his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>With a stockpile of cash after intensive fund-raising, whose demands had kept him off the trail, officials said, he will now make a greater effort to blend raising money with campaigning.</p>
        <p>And to the relief of many upstate party leaders, Mr. Lazio's campaign has picked up a new field adviser, Maury Houghton, who has impressed them with a determination to draw Mr. Lazio upstate more and more. Mr. Houghton carries a weighty name in those parts as the son of Representative Amo Houghton, an influential seven-term congressman from Corning.</p>
        <p>''Initially, there was some concern about his campaigning because of the short timetable he has to get everywhere,'' said Dian Levy, the Republican chairwoman of Tompkins County, which includes Ithaca. ''Now with the addition of key people like Maury, they are going to have him upstate quite a lot.''</p>
        <p>Many of the party officials referred to Maury Houghton as the upstate coordinator, though Lazio campaign officials said it was not a formal title and he was acting as a sort of super-volunteer.</p>
        <p>Robert Giarusso, the chairman of the Republican committee in Onondaga County, which includes Syracuse, said he believes Mr. Lazio has frequented his area but not other parts of upstate New York. He worries about polls that show Mr. Lazio with an advantage of 10 points or so upstate, when 15 or more would be needed to ensure a victory statewide, as upstate has long been the bedrock of Republican support.</p>
        <p>''He still needs to come up, and he will be coming up,'' Mr. Giarusso said. In fact, Mr. Lazio is due in Syracuse on Saturday for an Italian heritage festival, on a day that includes an unusually heavy schedule of five public events.</p>
        <p>Bill Dal Col, Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, said the congressman's renewed vigor stems less from the criticism than from the campaign's playbook. ''Clearly what we always stated was that after Labor Day the activity grows logarithmically,'' Mr. Dal Col said.</p>
        <p>It helps, he said, that Mr. Lazio has built a war chest of $19.2 million, lessening but not eliminating the pressure to spend time raising money. And with the House in session for only a few more weeks, Mr. Lazio soon will no longer have to shuttle between Washington and New York.</p>
        <p>''We will be there for key votes, but the most important vote is going to be Nov. 7 and we have to campaign,'' Mr. Dal Col said.</p>
        <p>On his bus trip through four upstate cities Thursday and a campaign swing to three schools today, Mr. Lazio certainly had a bounce in his step, even as he continued to defend his brandishing of a paper near Mrs. Clinton during their debate Wednesday night. Several students, through their questions, suggested Mr. Lazio was overbearing.</p>
        <p>''You're going to get tough questions wherever you go,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''I think it's a credit, frankly, to the school district that they have the courage to stand up and ask a tough question and they show an interest. I embrace that.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps Mr. Lazio was a little too exuberant. After an enthusiastic greeting by pupils in the auditorium of an elementary school in Riverhead, his final stop, he responded, ''Boy, I wish all of you were 21 years old right now.'' The voting age, which he apparently was referring to, is 18. (A campaign spokesman declined to comment.)</p>
        <p>And more is expected of Mr. Lazio, who entered the race in late May, than shaking hands. The unveiling of his plan to spend $97.75 billion more on education was only his second major policy address, after one last month proposing tax cuts. His assistants say more is to come, both in the policy arena and on the stump, using bus trips much more frequently.</p>
        <p>A Republican official in the Southern Tier, a region Mr. Lazio has visited often but mostly for festivals and low-key events, applauded such stops for broadening Mr. Lazio's exposure. ''But I'm not sure that's good enough,'' the official added. ''You have to have some sort of agenda, some sort of plan. He is not articulating that. A lot of people here don't even know he works in Congress.''</p>
