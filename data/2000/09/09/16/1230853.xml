        <p>Vice President Al Gore concluded a tightly controlled week devoted to fund-raising and education policy by telling an enthusiastic crowd of students at Howard University today that improving schools and access to college must become a major federal priority in coming years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore pointed out that the parents of school-age children now make up a smaller percentage of the overall voting population than ever before because the average age of Americans is rising and young adults, though a growing part of the population, are starting families later. That, he said, has undercut political support for the local tax increases and bond issues that typically pay for significant school improvements.</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore concluded a tightly controlled week devoted to fund-raising and education policy by telling an enthusiastic crowd of students at Howard University today that improving schools and access to college must become a major federal priority in coming years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore pointed out that the parents of school-age children now make up a smaller percentage of the overall voting population than ever before because the average age of Americans is rising and young adults, though a growing part of the population, are starting families later. That, he said, has undercut political support for the local tax increases and bond issues that typically pay for significant school improvements.</p>
        <p>The federal government, Mr. Gore said, must step into the breach. ''We need the biggest investment in education since the G.I. Bill,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has proposed spending $115 billion over 10 years on elementary and secondary education programs, and an additional $55 billion over that period on tax credits for college tuition and after-school care.</p>
        <p>Public opinion polls show that improving education and health care, the two issues that Mr. Gore has most emphasized since the Democratic convention, are the top priorities of voters this year. A New York Times/CBS News poll taken from Sept. 9 through 11 showed that about two-thirds of voters feel that both Mr. Gore and the Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, would be likely to improve education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore received a raucous reception from about 1,600 students packed into an auditorium at Howard, a predominantly black college here. The Howard band welcomed him with a brassy rendition of ''Love Train.''</p>
        <p>As he often does before heavily black audiences, Mr. Gore made a point of introducing and praising his campaign manager, Donna Brazile, who is black. And he began his speech by asking for a moment of silence in honor of Prince Jones, a Howard student who was shot to death by an undercover Prince George's County police officer on Sept. 1. Mr. Jones, who was unarmed and was being tailed by the police, was shot several times, allegedly after his car rammed a police car.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore took no position on the investigation of the case, but said to loud applause that ''the whole practice of racial profiling must come to an end.''</p>
        <p>The vice president barely referred to Mr. Bush during today's appearance. But the Democratic National Committee unveiled a new television advertisement mocking Mr. Bush's new campaign slogan, ''Real plans for real people.'' The advertisement, which will be shown in nine states, accuses Mr. Bush of keeping both the minimum wage in Texas and a children's health insurance program there beneath federal standards.</p>
        <p>''George Bush: his real plans hurt real people,'' the commercial concludes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's week was marked by a breakneck schedule, and he sounded a bit weary today after a night in New York City that ended after 1 a.m. with a gathering at Elaine's that followed a gala Democratic fund-raising concert at Radio City Music Hall. Using his schedule to send the message that he has the stamina and drive to be president, Mr. Gore ended virtually every campaign day this week well into the night.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign is highly disciplined these days, ensuring that Mr. Gore's appearances produce well-staged images and only intended messages. In contrast to Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore spends most of his time secluded from his traveling press corps, which typically sees him only on stage. His last open news conference was on July 17, and he ventures back to the press cabin of Air Force Two only occasionally, usually for brief chats.</p>
