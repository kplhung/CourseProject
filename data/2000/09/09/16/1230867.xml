        <p>After spending a bumpy month trying to deflect criticism of everything from the conservative votes he cast in Congress to his business affairs to his spotty voting record in Dallas, Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, has decided that the best defense is a strong offense.</p>
        <p>On campaign sorties into several crucial states this week, Mr. Cheney used some of his bluntest language yet to criticize Vice President Al Gore and his proposals for the economy, health care and education.</p>
        <p>''In my view Al Gore is not yet ready for the big chair,'' he told the Economic Club of Grand Rapids, Mich., on Wednesday. He criticized Mr. Gore's economic proposals by saying that ''some people call his plan a 'Swiss cheese budget' because it has so many holes in it.''</p>
        <p>He told a group in Kingston, Pa., on Tuesday that Mr. Gore's criticisms of Gov. George W. Bush's plan to overhaul Medicare were ''just flat-out wrong.'' And Mr. Cheney never refers to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles without calling it ''the Hollywood convention.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday in a Cleveland suburb, he accused Mr. Gore of hypocrisy for his stance against violence in entertainment. ''I find it a little hard to understand how, on the one hand, our opponents, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, can go out publicly and castigate Hollywood and the music industry for the kinds of material they produce,'' he said, ''and, on the other hand, go to their homes and hold fund-raisers and schmooze with them as they collect millions of dollars.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's newly combative language is just one of several readjustments he has made on the campaign trail this week, after his choice as Gov. George W. Bush's running mate was openly questioned by some leading Republicans who were concerned about Mr. Gore's rising poll numbers. Mr. Cheney has also continued to work on adopting a more relaxed style on the stump.</p>
        <p>'' You've got to keep banging away at your objectives and your message, and not be blown by the winds of the moment on any given issue, any given day,'' Mr. Cheney told reporters. ''That's what's called for here. Polls go up, polls go down. Stuff happens. You've got to be able to maintain your focus and keep plowing ahead.''</p>
        <p>To that end, he spent the week talking about Medicare in Pennsylvania, taxes in Michigan and education in Ohio. It was just how Bush aides had initially said they planned to use Mr. Cheney: send him to hotly contested, undecided states with a significant number of electoral votes, rather than relegate him to the lesser role sometimes accorded to running mates of shoring up the party's base in small, safe states.</p>
        <p>This week Mr. Cheney continued to fight his reputation as a stilted campaigner by using more humor in his speeches and more gestures to emphasize his points and by fielding more questions from the audience.</p>
        <p>At a firehouse in Kingston, Pa., Mr. Cheney got a laugh with a story from his days as Wyoming's lone Congressman. He was running for re-election, his story went, when he spotted a cowboy at a festival and asked for his vote. ''You've got it,'' he remembered the cowboy as saying. ''That fool we've got there now's no damn good.''</p>
        <p>In Montague, Mich., he shed his necktie and donned a green Michigan State anorak for a campaign stop on a family farm, where he discussed Governor Bush's proposal to abolish the estate tax, or, as he called it, the death tax. It was a crisp, clear day, and the corn fields, the red barn, the John Deere tractor and a crowd of supporters sitting on bales of hay all made for a very different photo opportunity from the nursing homes, schools and airport hangars of the past few weeks.</p>
        <p>At a rally today at Jefferson County Airport in Broomfield, Colo., a small plane flew behind Mr. Cheney's lectern trailing a banner trumpeting one of the Bush campaign's favorite slogans: ''Help Is on the Way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney bought a few new suits in Virginia last weekend. And his campaign is suddenly playing music -- Van Morrison's ''Bright Side of the Road'' and the inevitable theme from ''Rocky'' -- to warm up crowds along the trail.</p>
        <p>There have been a few hitches, though. After speaking at a rally on Thursday in the Marietta High School gym, he was questioned by the editor of the school paper about the effect of school vouchers on resources for public schools. Then, after Mr. Cheney fielded questions from the audience, a student rose to complain that he was ignoring the concerns of the children in the bleachers, causing many fellow students to stand and cheer.</p>
        <p>So, Mr. Cheney stayed longer than he had intended, to take a few more questions from students and, as he left, said: ''Let me apologize to our friends over here in the stands. I certainly did not mean to ignore the students.''</p>
        <p>At nearly every stop, Mr. Cheney has stepped up his criticism of Mr. Gore, assuming the traditional role of the running mate. ''We are using him to counterpunch more,'' said Karl Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, discussing education, Mr. Cheney accused Mr. Gore of being ''soft on accountability.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney began to go down this road last Friday at a campaign appearance at a senior center in Connecticut, where he responded to Democratic criticism of Gov. George W. Bush's Medicare plan. But his speech there was almost eclipsed by a series of embarrassments. A Republican Congressional candidate for whom he had gone there to stump  released an ad that day praising his Democratic rival, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman. A newspaper reported that Mr. Cheney had missed 14 of the 16 elections during the five years he was registered in Dallas. Then The Associated Press reported that the company he led, Halliburton, maintained separate bathrooms overseas for American and foreign workers.</p>
        <p>This week, Mr. Cheney voiced some of his frustrations with the press. ''It's always fascinating for me to watch and see that those of us who get in the arena -- put our names on the ballot, go out and slug it out every day for something we believe in -- spend all of our time then being critiqued by people who have never been in the arena, never will get in the arena, sit in the bleachers and do well second-guessing what we're all about,'' he said in Michigan, responding to a member of the Economic Club who had asked him about bias in the media.</p>
        <p>''It's much easier, frankly, to cover some of the trivial stuff that from time to time seems to dominate when we get one these feeding frenzies going,'' he said. ''But it is unfortunate, I think, because what happens is it does not lead to informed debate and dialogue. It means you've got this huge news mechanism, a media mechanism, discussing trivia.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rove, the Bush campaign strategist, said that Mr. Cheney was showing signs of warming up to campaigning and noted that it had been 12 years since he had run for office. ''He's flexing his political muscles,'' he said.</p>
