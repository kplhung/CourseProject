        <p>National Football League coaches tend to be more overly dramatic than they need to be, so it is sometimes difficult to take what they say seriously. But Jim Fassel said this week that his team had reason to worry Sunday, when the Giants face the seemingly hapless Bears in Chicago.</p>
        <p>''It's a scary game when you think about it,'' Fassel said. ''The only thing I'm counting on is our guys, and they seem that way right now, to be in the right frame of mind. They have perspective. You can say one thing and do another, but they seem focused right now. It'll be a big challenge for us.''</p>

        <p>National Football League coaches tend to be more overly dramatic than they need to be, so it is sometimes difficult to take what they say seriously. But Jim Fassel said this week that his team had reason to worry Sunday, when the Giants face the seemingly hapless Bears in Chicago.</p>
        <p>''It's a scary game when you think about it,'' Fassel said. ''The only thing I'm counting on is our guys, and they seem that way right now, to be in the right frame of mind. They have perspective. You can say one thing and do another, but they seem focused right now. It'll be a big challenge for us.''</p>
        <p>The Giants, with a 2-0 record, should easily beat a Bears team that has lost both of its games. Chicago is coming off a 41-0 loss at Tampa Bay and figures to be desperate in its home opener. Fassel has not wasted that reminder on his players this week, and they seem to be listening, almost paraphrasing their coach.</p>
        <p>''I'm scared to death of this game,'' quarterback Kerry Collins said. ''It's going to be real tough, and anybody in this locker room that doesn't think it's going to be tough is kidding themselves.''</p>
        <p>Collins will be facing a defense that was blown out last week, but Fassel said Chicago trailed by 6-0 before Tampa Bay scored twice in the final two minutes of the first half. The Bears will be starting their first-round pick, Brian Urlacher, at middle linebacker in place of the injured Barry Minter (bruised back). The Bears said they would simplify their defense because of Urlacher's inexperience.</p>
        <p>The Giants' offense should only improve. Relying on running backs Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne, the Giants rushed for 223 yards in an opening-game victory over Arizona. Barber had another big game against Philadelphia last Sunday, but Collins and receivers Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard combined for 15 catches. That all-out attack more closely resembled the expanded offense the team promised during the off-season. The offense totaled 387 yards in a 33-18 victory over Philadelphia and repeatedly answered each time the Eagles mounted a second-half rally.</p>
        <p>Against the Bears, the Giants will add tight end Pete Mitchell into that mix, although Fassel said Mitchell would not be a featured part of the offense. Mitchell returned to full practice this week for the first time since severely spraining his left knee in the first preseason game against Chicago on Aug. 5, when the Bears scored 17 unanswered second-half points to beat the Giants, 20-8.</p>
        <p>Mitchell required arthroscopic surgery that week, and Fassel has been cautious not to install many plays around him in case he had a setback this week. Mitchell enters the game healthy, but he has barely played with the new offense.</p>
        <p>''We're only going to use him in a certain number of parts of the game,'' Fassel said. ''We don't want to build a game plan around him.''</p>
        <p>Mitchell's 58 receptions last season were the most for a Giants tight end since Mark Bavaro caught 66 in 1986. But he was slowed for four games with a sprained ankle before missing the final game.</p>
        <p>''I've been waiting a long time to get healthy,'' Mitchell said.</p>
        <p>Without Mitchell, the Giants have one completion to a tight end, Dan Campbell, in two games. Mitchell was a valuable weapon for the Giants on third down last season, but they managed fine without him the past two weeks. They converted 7 of 14 third-down situations last week at Philadelphia, with Collins completing 6 of 8 passes for first downs.</p>
        <p>The Giants' third-down efficiency has been so good that linebacker Jessie Armstead does not even get off the bench in those situations anymore.</p>
        <p>''I know they're going to find a way to get a first down,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That efficiency allowed the defense to stay fresh, a rare treat in past years. It makes a difference.</p>
        <p>''It's like running a race after warming up a mile first as opposed to being fresh,'' the defensive coordinator John Fox said. ''Amani Toomer came up to me and said: 'Coach, you got too many three-and-outs. We're out there too much.' ''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>RON DIXON, a rookie receiver and kick returner, tweaked his knee toward the end of practice on Friday, but Coach JIM FASSEL said he was fine for Sunday's game.</p>
