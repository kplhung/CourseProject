      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County executive, submitted a four-year budget plan at 11:58 p.m. Friday night, two minutes before an end-of-the-day deadline set by state fiscal monitors overseeing his administration's troubled finances.</p>
        <p>The timing of the submission fell well short of what the state monitors and county legislators had been expecting, especially since the monitors, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, have threatened to seize control of the county's finances.</p>
        <p>Because of the late hour, details of the proposal were sketchy and officials had not been able to assess its substance fully. But Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the presiding officer of the County Legislature, said a brief study of the documents left her with more questions than she had had before.</p>
        <p>Chuck Cutolo, the counsel to the County Legislature's Democratic majority, was also critical of Mr. Gulotta, a Republican.</p>
        <p>''It is very embarrassing to work on this for months and months, pull a budgetary all-nighter and barely make the deadline,'' he said. ''It is embarrassing to the county executive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cutolo said that Richard M. Kessel, a member of the monitoring board, had called legislators at about 11:45 p.m. to tell them that the budget documents were being rushed to his home in Merrick by a county law enforcement officer so that he could deliver them to five other board members and to Frank G. Zarb, the board chairman.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs kept the office of the clerk of the Legislature open well past its normal closing time of 4:45 p.m. to await Mr. Gulotta's submission, Mr. Cutolo said.</p>
        <p>Aides to Ms. Jacobs said that a state takeover of the county's finances had not been likely in the event that the deadline was missed, but that the county's credibility would be seriously damaged.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gulotta suggested his fiscal proposal was worth the wait.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the most thorough and sound, meaningfully structured budgets that has ever been submitted,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When asked why he took so long and nearly missed the deadline, Mr. Gulotta said, ''It included a whole host of documentation including the four-year plan, backup information from department heads and all of the laws that are necessary for the Legislature to act upon.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs was unimpressed with what she had seen.</p>
        <p>''We just started to look through it,'' she said. ''It seems that it still does not identify the areas of cutting of jobs and laying off of people. There is obviously no further specifics about departments involved or people involved.'' And she said aspects of the proposal dealing with the later years were shaky, particularly $50 million from a town and city sales tax that would require state authorization.</p>
        <p>Her fiscal officer, Mark Young, said the budget proposal appears to total $2.213 billion, less than 1 percent under last year's $2.218 billion figure.</p>
        <p>Darren Bloch, the chief of staff for the legislative majority, said Mr. Gulotta's plan showed property tax increases of 3 percent in 2002, 2003 and 2004, to balance the budget.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Mr. Gulotta had already revealed that he would propose raising property taxes by 4 percent, laying off more than 350 county workers and merging 15 county departments as part of his plan to close a roughly $140 million deficit next year.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 5, he proposed draft budget plans that Democratic and Republican leaders said lacked the kind of detail necessary to assess them or to determine if they would truly cut $140 million.</p>
        <p>While Democratic and Republican lawmakers agreed that $90 million worth of Mr. Gulotta's proposals were valid, including a $33-per-household property tax raise, they remained skeptical about $50 million worth of his items, saying they needed more details.</p>
        <p>The documents he submitted Friday night were supposed to show the details of those plans and provide proof of balanced future budgets to stave off state oversight.</p>
        <p>Friday night, as the midnight hour approached, the frustration legislators had felt throughout the day was turning into incredulity and anger.</p>
        <p>Members of both parties said it was incomprehensible that Mr. Gulotta could act so late.</p>
        <p>''Sept. 15 is not a surprise on the calendar,'' said Robert W. Lazaro, a spokesman for Peter J. Schmitt, the Legislature's Republican leader. ''It is not like this is getting ready for a term paper for college. It is a $2.2 billion budget for a county of 1.3 million people and you would expect better than this. Sept. 15 comes every year. It should not be a surprise.''</p>
        <p>Legislative committee hearings on his proposal are set for this month.  The Legislature has until Oct. 30 by county charter to pass the budget. But Mr. Zarb, the chairman of the oversight board, would like a document ratified by Oct. 17, lawmakers say.</p>
        <p>The Legislature can change the budget. Whether it does or not, it must send it back to Mr. Gulotta, who can use a line-item veto on any changes the Legislature makes. If he does exercise his veto right, the Legislature needs a two-thirds majority, or 13 votes, to override.</p>
        <p>In neighboring Suffolk, County Executive Robert J. Gaffney unveiled his 2001 budget proposal and presented it to the County Legislature in time for the deadline set by county law, the third Friday in September. The proposal totals $1.98 billion, which is 6.6 percent higher than the county's adopted 2000 budget, said Kenneth P. Weiss, the Suffolk County budget director.</p>
        <p>He said Suffolk ended the 2000 fiscal year with an estimated $77 million surplus, the second-highest general fund surplus in county history.</p>
