        <p>A witness to the assassination of the leading Mexican presidential candidate in 1994 has requested asylum in the United States. He is pleading to avoid deportation to Mexico, where an arrest warrant has been issued against him and where he says his life would be in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>The witness, Jorge Amaral Munoz, 39, is awaiting an appeal of an immigration judge's ruling last winter that Mr. Amaral did not qualify for asylum because he had not demonstrated political repression.</p>
        <p>Mr. Amaral has been charged in Mexico with making false statements to judicial authorities and will be jailed if he is returned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Amaral witnessed the gunning down of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P.R.I., which has dominated Mexico for decades but lost the presidential election this summer. Mr. Amaral was in the crowd near Mr. Colosio when he was shot in Tijuana.</p>
        <p>Although the current prosecutor in the case insists that a lone gunman fired at Mr. Colosio, many outside the ruling party question that. The president-elect, Vicente Fox Quesada, Mexico's first opposition leader to be elected president, has promised to reopen the case after he assumes office in December.</p>
        <p>''We had 71 years of the P.R.I. government,'' said Mr. Amaral in a phone interview from Wayne County Jail in Detroit. ''They still control the judicial system and the government.''</p>
        <p>''There is more interest now, than perhaps at any other time, to silence my testimony,'' Mr. Amaral said.</p>
        <p>Officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service reached in Washington said it was their policy not to comment on asylum cases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Amaral testified on three occasions, sometimes saying there was one gunman, and sometimes two.</p>
        <p>His lawyer, Tamara A. French, who made the first reports on his case, said his statements changed ''because five officials interrogated him with weapons and forced him to sign a false statement.''</p>
        <p>Mario Aburto Martinez, a mechanic, was convicted of the killing.</p>
        <p>Immigration Judge John Walsh, ruling on Feb. 10, said that he did not contest Mr. Amaral's fear of retribution or the credibility of his story, but that because his persecution was not based on his political opinion, he was not eligible for asylum.</p>
