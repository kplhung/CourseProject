        <p>Conspiracy theories abound about the shrouded sculpture that has towered over Foley Square since January.</p>
        <p>Maybe the government is hiding something. Perhaps the sculpture is offensive. Maybe someone just goofed big time.</p>
        <p>But as onlookers and passers-by speculate about why the sculpture has remained hidden beneath a big green tarpaulin for so long, Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern, whose department maintains Foley Square, has dismissed the hubbub.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said the department was honoring the artist's request that the work be unveiled in a formal ceremony. The department had encountered problems scheduling the event, and would finally reveal the sculpture on Oct. 12, Mr. Stern said.</p>
        <p>But the artist said he had not expected that the ceremony would take eight months to organize. He said he believed Mr. Stern simply did not like the sculpture.</p>
        <p>''It's just more foot-dragging, that's what it is,'' said Lorenzo Pace, a Brooklyn artist chosen from among more than 440 applicants to design the sculpture. ''It's been a patient, angry process to get this unveiled.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern would not comment on what he thought of the sculpture, but said his opinion did not influence the timetable for the unveiling.</p>
        <p>''It's art,'' Mr. Stern said. ''Some people will like it. Some people won't.''</p>
        <p>The sculpture, called ''Triumph of the Human Spirit,'' stands over the site of the African Burial Ground, which was unearthed in 1991 just north of City Hall. The Burial Ground was used as a cemetery for black New Yorkers for much of the 18th century.</p>
        <p>The monument is a four-story rendition of ancient West African Chi Wara headdresses perched atop a canoe, which represents slave vessels, according to an inscription at the site. The piece is made entirely of black granite and weighs about 300 tons.</p>
        <p>The design pays tribute not only to 427 slaves buried near the site, but also to Native Americans and to early immigrants who also made their home in the city, Mr. Pace said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said his department had been trying to schedule the unveiling so that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Senator Daniel P. Moynihan could attend. Mr. Moynihan's office helped obtain $5.25 million in federal money for renovation and maintenance of the memorial and its surroundings.</p>
        <p>''They are very busy people,'' Mr. Stern said. ''It's hard to find a time that's just right for both of them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said his department had also been waiting for the completion of reconstruction work at Foley Square, a small park at Centre and Pearl Streets in Lower Manhattan. Construction was not finished until late this summer, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pace said he requested a formal ceremony because of the significance of the sculpture. He said he had hoped that his work would be unveiled within a month.</p>
        <p>Just getting his design approved took a long time, he said, adding that two of his previous designs were rejected by the city.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pace said the scheduling problems are in the same vein as delays that have affected the burial site since its discovery.</p>
        <p>Many blacks felt that the city had not acted quickly enough to preserve and commemorate the burial ground.</p>
        <p>Peggy King Jorde, now the lead consultant for the memorial, who was working for former Mayor David N. Dinkins when the burial ground was discovered, said that from its inception, the project has ''sort of had a problem of it not being a high priority for the city.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jorde, who is not involved with the schedule for the unveiling, said she had initially suspected some hidden controversy because it had taken ''unusually long'' to organize a ceremony date. But after speaking with city officials and with Senator Moynihan's office, she said she was convinced there were legitimate scheduling problems.</p>
        <p>''It already wasn't being handled with the level of urgency that it should have been, but to add eight months of scheduling conflicts on top of that -- I can see how people can suspect something is wrong,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 20, 2000, Wednesday  An article on Saturday about plans to unveil a sculpture by Lorenzo Pace in Foley Square commemorating an 18th-century cemetery for black New Yorkers misstated the location of the statue. The statue is in Foley Square, within the African Burial Ground and the Commons Historic District. The statue is not on the nearby site within the district where part of the burial ground was excavated in 1991 during construction of the Federal Building at 290 Broadway.</p>
