        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''A Father's Footsteps Echo Throughout a Son's Career'' (front page, Sept. 11) begins with what I found to be the most telling anecdote about George W. Bush's personality.  Worried about what his father's election to the presidency in 1988 would mean for him, he asked one of his father's aides to write a report about what had become of the children of presidents. Mr. Bush could have researched this himself, but he saw no problem in wasting the time of one of his father's aides.</p>
