        <p>Pankaj Mishra Op-Ed article observes that Hindu nationalists, for all their aspirations to 21st-century greatness for India, remain attached to stern 19th-century idea of nationalism that dilutes cultural and social diversity; cites violence against minorities, takeover of research institutions by Hindu ideologues and new Hindu-oriented school curriculums (M)</p>

        <p>In the last two years, the Indian government, dominated by the Hindu nationalist party, Bharatiya Janata, has tried to establish an exalted position in the world for India.

        <p>In the last two years, the Indian government, dominated by the Hindu nationalist party, Bharatiya Janata, has tried to establish an exalted position in the world for India. It has conducted nuclear tests, lobbied hard for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and played up the West's high demand for India's skilled information-technology workers. Atal Behari Vajpayee, the Indian prime minister, who met with President Clinton in Washington and addressed the Congress this week, hopes to achieve, among other things, an American endorsement of India's claim to superpower status.</p>
        <p>For all these aspirations to 21st century greatness, however, the Hindu nationalists remain attached to a stern 19th-century idea of nationalism, which dilutes traditional social and cultural diversity and replaces it with one people, one culture and one language.</p>
        <p>The intolerant climate can be seen in the growing incidents of violence against minorities, particularly Christian missionaries, the steady takeover of government research institutions by Hindu ideologues and the introduction of Hindu-oriented syllabuses in schools and universities.</p>
        <p>In neighboring Pakistan, which was created as a homeland for Muslims in 1947, a similar attempt at building a monolithic national identity, through Islam, has produced disastrous results.</p>
        <p>Since Islam has failed to bind the country's many ethnic and linguistic minorities, the job of holding the country together has fallen to the Pakistani army. It has tried to pacify the minorities through brutal, and sometimes counterproductive, methods. For instance, in 1971, the terrorized Bengali Muslim population of East Pakistan seceded to form, with India's assistance, the new nation of Bangladesh.</p>
        <p>Despite that loss, the power of the Pakistani army grew and grew. Ruled by a military dictator, Pakistan became the overeager host, in 1979, of the C.I.A.'s proxy war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. The arms received from the United States and Saudi Arabia found their way to the black market. Civil war broke out as competing Islamic outfits fought each other with their deadly new weapons. And a flourishing drug trade led to an estimated five million Pakistanis becoming heroin addicts.</p>
        <p>In the last 20 years, drug smugglers, Islamic fundamentalists and army intelligence officers have come to dominate Pakistan's political life. Jihad, now exported to the disputed territory of Kashmir and the Central Asian republics, is the semi-official creed of many in the ruling elite. Pakistan is now even further away from being a multi-ethnic democracy.</p>
        <p>India looks more stable, but its political culture has changed drastically in the last two decades. The central government, as distrustful of federal autonomy as Pakistan's ruling elite, has used brute force in Punjab, the northeastern states, and now in Kashmir to suppress disaffected minorities.</p>
        <p>In the process, India's awkward but worthy experiment with secular democracy has been replaced by a vague, but aggressive, ideology of a unitary Hindu nationalism.</p>
        <p>The new upper-caste Hindu middle class, created by India's freshly globalized economy, includes this nationalism's most fervent supporters. It greeted India's nuclear tests in 1998 euphorically.</p>
        <p>But this middle class is also apolitical and a bit unsure of itself. Its preoccupations are best reflected in the revamped news media, which now focus more on fashion designers and beauty queens than on the dark realities of a poor and violent country.</p>
        <p>Popular patriotism brings temporary clarity to the confused self-image of the new middle class and helps veil some of the government's more questionable actions. For instance, in Kashmir, the government's failure to accommodate the aspirations of the mostly Muslim population led to a popular armed uprising against Indian rule.</p>
        <p>The Hindu nationalists describe the uprising as an attack on the very idea of India and have diverted an enormous amount of national energy and resources -- including some 400,000 soldiers -- toward fighting the insurgents and their Pakistani supporters.</p>
        <p>Since the invisible majority of India's billion-strong population -- its destitute masses -- couldn't care less about Kashmir, it is the affluent Hindu middle class that enforces the domestic consensus on the subject. It blames Pakistan for everything, ignoring the harshness of Indian rule and the near-total collapse of civil liberties in Kashmir.</p>
        <p>Supporters of Hindu nationalism assume that a country with a strong military can absorb any amount of conflict and anomie within its borders. But the preference for force over dialogue could end up undermining India's fragile democracy and growing economy -- just as the excessive reliance on military solutions to political problems has blighted Pakistan.</p>
