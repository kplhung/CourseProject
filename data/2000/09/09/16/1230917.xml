        <p>Gavin Casey, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, resigned in the wake of a botched plan to merge with the Frankfurt exchange. Mr. Casey's resignation came a day after shareholders barely re-elected him, with 56 percent approval. The chairman of the exchange, Don Cruickshank, who also narrowly won re-election, will take over Mr. Casey's duties until a replacement is named. The London exchange is preparing to defend against a hostile bid from OM Gruppen, a Swedish technology company that runs the Stockholm exchange.</p>
