        <p>The injuries nagging at the Yankees seemed like nothing more than a nuisance a week ago, but with the playoffs on the horizon, some of the trouble threatens to overlap into the postseason. Exhibit A: Paul O'Neill.</p>
        <p>The All-Star right fielder, just one of a long list of Yankees playing hurt, reinjured his right hip chasing a fly ball in the Yankees' 11-1 loss to Cleveland at Yankee Stadium last night, and said he will have another cortisone shot today.</p>
        <p>''I'm not helping anybody right now,'' said O'Neill, his face betraying his concern.</p>
        <p>David Cone (4-12) made his first start since dislocating his left (nonthrowing) shoulder 10 days earlier, and he pitched well  -- certainly better than his final line of five and two-thirds innings, nine hits, four walks and six runs.</p>
        <p>Cleveland's Dave Burba pitched eight scoreless innings and the Indians retained their one-game lead over Oakland in the wild-card race.</p>
        <p>But when the game started, O'Neill was one of only a handful of regulars in the Yankee lineup, and he was replaced before the start of the seventh inning.</p>
        <p>O'Neill injured his hip Aug. 23 and several days later, he received a shot of cortisone. He has played most of the games since then, running and fielding better on some days than others. But he tweaked his hip last week, sat out Thursday night's game against the Toronto Blue Jays, and while chasing a foul ball in the in the fourth inning last night, he felt more pain.</p>
        <p>Running the bases in the bottom of the fourth, O'Neill was clearly laboring, particularly when he tagged up and moved from second to third on a fly ball.</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre, who had been trying to keep O'Neill in the lineup so that his No. 3 hitter could maintain the feel for his swing, said his intention now is to rest O'Neill until his hip is as healed as it can be before the start of the playoffs in about two weeks.</p>
        <p>The Yankees lead the Red Sox by seven games and Toronto by eight in the American League East, so Torre is resting his injured players as much as possible now. Bernie Williams, who has a rib cage strain and a calf strain, could miss the remaining three games of this series with the Indians, to ensure that he is well enough to hit from the left side when the playoffs start. First baseman Tino Martinez sat out last night's game because of a sore left elbow and left leg, and he probably will sit out tomorrow, when the left-hander Chuck Finley will start for the Indians.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' leadoff hitter, felt increased pain in his right elbow making a sidearm throw earlier this week and sat out last night's game, although he thought he could have played. Knoblauch may or may not play today. ''I'm resigned to having this pain the rest of the year,'' Knoblauch said.</p>
        <p>Torre rested catcher Jorge Posada last night, and will rest shortstop Derek Jeter today. Outfielder David Justice is playing with a sore right groin muscle.</p>
        <p>At least Cone is back, with a few starts to prove to Torre that he should be part of the postseason roster.</p>
        <p>Only 10 days had passed since Cone's left shoulder was jarred out of its socket in Kansas City, an injury that had many in the Yankees' organization convinced -- Cone included -- that he would not pitch again this season. ''It felt good to be out there again,'' Cone said.</p>
        <p>Facing Kansas City Sept. 5, Cone dived to catch a bunt and landed on his left elbow. The force of the landing caused his shoulder to pop out of place. In spite of the agonizing pain he felt before the shoulder was maneuvered back into place, Cone recovered quickly and found his shoulder to be mostly functional. He took a painkiller before last night's game and went to work.</p>
        <p>His velocity was down and he did not use his split-fingered fastball as much as he usually does, but Cone had a good slider, changing speeds with that pitch and his curveball, and he allowed two runs in the first five innings. Slow reactions of the fielders behind him contributed to both runs.</p>
        <p>But Cone was often behind in the count and created his own trouble, and his line got very ugly in the sixth. He walked Russell Branyan leading off and Sandy Alomar and Kenny Lofton singled, loading the bases. Branyan scored on a fielder's choice grounder and Roberto Alomar drove home his brother with a sacrifice fly, giving the Indians a 4-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Cone walked Manny Ramirez and was replaced by Jason Grimsley -- who walked a batter to load the bases before allowing a grand slam to David Segui. The Yankees surrendered six runs in the inning, ending a streak of 141 consecutive innings in which they allowed no more than two runs in an inning.</p>
        <p>''I thought Coney was OK,'' said Torre, ''considering he missed a start.''</p>
        <p>At least he's healthy enough to function. Time will tell how healthy O'Neill and others will be when the playoffs start.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>RAMIRO MENDOZA will have arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder next Thursday, when Dr. JAMES ANDREWS will attempt to determine the source of Mendoza's recurring tendinitis that limited him to just one outing after June 24. Mendoza is out for the year, and his physical problems will place the Yankees in a quandary as they try to assess his role and value for 2001. After fending off dozens of trade offers for Mendoza before this season, the Yankees considered trading Mendoza several times this year.</p>
