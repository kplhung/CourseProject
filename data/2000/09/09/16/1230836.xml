        <p>He has inspired a book of poetry (''Girls on the Run'' by John Ashbery), fashion designs (by Anna Sui), a British rock band (the Vivian Girls), a Hawaiian dance (''The Valley of Io''), a video game (Sissy Fight at www.sissyfight.com), an opera (being composed by Douglas Cuomo), a play (''Jennie Richee'' by Mac Wellman, opening in February at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago) and a movie prospect (now canceled). He has been compared to Lewis Carroll, Fra Angelico, Andy Warhol, Balthus and Dr. Seuss. The word ''genius'' has often been used near his name, but so, occasionally, have the words ''mind of a serial killer.'' His work has been called part ''Child's Garden of Verses,'' part ''pedophilic fantasy.'' He drew tribes of little girls, and gave some of them little penises.</p>
        <p>Henry Darger (1892-1973) spent much of his life in Chicago rummaging through trash cans, going to Mass, writing about the weather and fighting with tangled balls of twine. When he died, he left an apartment filled with hundreds of old Pepto Bismol bottles; plastic maple syrup containers; balls of string; a windup Edison phonograph; a music box, and plaster figurines of Jesus and Mary.  That was not all.</p>
        <p>''Where there was any wall space, and tacked around every door frame, were pictures of little girls that had been cut out of magazines, newspapers and coloring books,'' Michael Bonesteel writes in ''Henry Darger: Art and Selected Writings,'' to be published by Rizzoli in November. There were pictures of the Dionne quintuplets, some 20 pictures of the Coppertone Girl and many pictures of Little Annie Roonie.</p>
        <p>Two trunks held a lifetime of writing: a 5,000-page, eight-volume work titled ''The History of My Life,'' which included thousands of pages on a single tornado; a weather journal covering exactly 10 years, from Dec. 31, 1957, to Dec. 31, 1967; and a series of diaries detailing how many times he went to Mass and his many tantrums over twine.</p>
        <p>The biggest surprise was a creepy, obsessive 15,000-page manuscript typed in different colored inks. It was called ''The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal of the Glandico-Angelinian Wars, as Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion.'' And it had an 8,500-page sequel, ''Further Adventures in Chicago.''</p>
        <p>The Vivian girls -- Violet, Joice, Jennie, Catherine, Hettie, Daisy and Evangeline -- are the heroines of ''The Realms.'' They unite with gentle, child-loving dragons called the Blengiglomenean Serpents (Blengins for short) in a four-year--seven-month war (fought sometime between 1910 and 1917 and roughly following the outlines of World War I) against the Glandelinians, a race of fallen Catholics who enslave and torture children. In the end, the girls prevail and so do the Catholic nations of Abbieannia, Angelinia, Abyssinkile, Protestentia and Calverinia, but not before many children are tortured and killed.</p>
        <p>If Darger had left only the text, he might be just another forgotten recluse. But he also made 300 illustrations -- everything from small watercolors to 12-foot-long mural-size scrolls, often painted on both sides.</p>
        <p>Darger crammed his huge, fantastical landscapes with baby-faced girls, some clothed in colorful dresses, bathing suits and pinafores, and others naked. He equipped certain girls with horns and others with penises; he showed some being disemboweled or strangled, tongues lolling out, and he drew others enjoying the sunshine, the butterflies and the huge flowers. The girls' eyes, as John MacGregor, a pre-eminent Darger scholar, has pointed out, shine in the dark because Darger filled them in with pencil lead.</p>
        <p>Darger had trouble drawing figures, so he traced or cut and pasted images taken from comics, children's books and magazines. If they weren't the right size, he had them enlarged at his local drugstore. The results were stunning. The Nation's critic Arthur Danto has called Darger ''a genius of stammering achievement.'' Time magazine's critic Robert Hughes has toyed with the term ''Poussin of pedophilia.''</p>
        <p>Darger (pronouced DAHR-gurr) had a rotten childhood. When he was 4, his mother died while giving birth to his sister, who was put up for adoption. As a child, Darger was not fond of girls. He ''threw ashes in one little girl's eyes and tried to slash another girl with a knife,'' Mr. Bonesteel writes. When he was 8, his father, a tailor, could no longer take care of him.</p>
        <p>Darger went to live in a Catholic mission. Apparently he was thrown out for masturbating. He was put in the Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children in Lincoln, Ill. There he became absorbed with religious rituals. He once wrote, ''I burned holy pictures and hit the face of Christ in pictures with my fist.'' At 16 he ran away from the asylum. For the next half-century, Mr. Bonesteel tells us, Darger worked ''as a janitor, dishwasher and bandage roller at three Chicago hospitals.''</p>
        <p>He lived a life of magnificent confinement. The room he occupied had no kitchen or bathroom, and the great events of his life were meteorological. He went to Mass as many as four or five times a day. ''He would rarely speak to anyone, but if spoken to would respond politely -- always about the weather,'' his landlord, Nathan Lerner, recalled in a written statement. ''He was a remarkable mimic and sometimes there would be an animated quarrel going on between a deep gruff voice, which was supposed to be he, and a querulous high-pitched voice, which was supposed to be his superior, a nun.''</p>
        <p>Kiyoko Lerner, the widow of Darger's landlord, remembered that Darger ''would walk around the neighborhood picking through garbage -- string, magazines, newspapers, books, anything.'' He brought everything into his room and never took anything out. The room was packed floor to ceiling. A narrow pathway ran from the door to the desk, where Darger both worked and, it seems, slept.</p>
        <p>In 1972, old and crippled, Darger moved to a place he called Little Sisters of the Poor, a nursing home in Chicago. He died on April 13, 1973, and was given a pauper's burial at All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines, Ill.</p>
        <p>Darger's real life, though, was with his Vivian girls. ''The first indication that Darger had stepped across the line between reality and fantasy happened in the summer of 1912,'' Mr. Bonesteel writes in his book. ''He dubbed the catalytic event 'The Great Aronburg Mystery.' ''</p>
        <p>Darger apparently lost a photograph he had cut from The Chicago Daily News of May 9, 1911, a picture of a murdered child named Elsie Paroubek. In ''The Realms'' she became the model for Annie Aronburg, a martyr who is slashed with a razor and strangled.</p>
        <p>While Darger was obsessed with children in general -- he and his only friend, Whilliam Schloeder, formed a two-man club they called the Children's Protective Society -- he was particularly taken with the photograph of Elsie. (Mr. MacGregor has suggested that Darger murdered her.) Darger bargained with God. ''If the picture were not returned by a certain time -- and he kept pushing the date farther and farther ahead -- he would turn the tide of the war against the Christian nations,'' Mr. Bonesteel writes. God did not respond, and Darger started drawing little girls being massacred by the Glandelinians.</p>
        <p>At that point, the story became ''a blood bath,'' as Stewart Lee Allen wrote in a review of a Darger show in The San Franciso Bay Guardian, quoting Darger's script: ''Little girls, from the ages of 9, 8 and even younger, were tied down stark naked and a spade full of red-hot live coals laid on their bellies. Scores upon scores of poor children were cut to pieces, after being strangled to death. . . . Children were forced to swallow the sliced fragments of dead children's hearts. . . . Their protruding tongues were extracted.''</p>
        <p>The killing did not stop until Col. Henry Darger joined forces with the Vivian girls. And then, Mr. Bonesteel says, the war quickly ended. Gen. John Manley, the chief villain of ''The Realms,'' named for a bully from Darger's childhood, surrendered.</p>
        <p>Darger the artist was saved by one man: his landlord, Nathan Lerner, a photographer trained at the New Bauhaus in Chicago. If he had not intervened, the paintings and manuscripts would probably have been destroyed. ''I told him to throw them away,'' says Mr. Lerner's widow, who owns the rights to Darger's work.</p>
        <p>Darger became a darling of outsider art. In 1977 his work was shown at the Hyde Park Art Center. Other shows followed, most of them put on by the Phyllis Kind Gallery, and most of them linking Darger with outsider art or Art Brut, a tradition of madness and creativity that went back to painters like Bosch, Bruegel, Goya and Gericault.</p>
        <p>But Darger's status really soared in 1997, when the Museum of American Folk Art in New York mounted a show put together at the University of Iowa by Stephen Prokopoff. Now the Art Brut Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, owns more than 20 Dargers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bonesteel is compiling a condensed version of ''The Realms.'' There is talk of a Darger study center in New York that would include his writings. And the Intuit Gallery in Chicago is working on a reconstruction of Darger's room. Jane Kallir, the director of the Galerie St. Etienne in Manhattan, says, ''You can get a very good Darger for $75,000 to $80,000.''</p>
        <p>How did this happen? ''It is the quality, the magnitude, the crowded cluttered composition, the unfathomability'' of the work, Brooke Anderson, the director and curator of the Contemporary Center at the Museum of American Folk Art, says. And of course, she adds, there is ''the secrecy, the privacy.'' Ms. Lerner says ''the size is one thing'' that draws people to the paintings, but it is also that they are ''so raw.'' There is ''no hypocrisy'' in them, she says. He was not thinking of an audience.</p>
        <p>Or was he?</p>
        <p>Darger, Mr. Bonesteel suggests, may actually have anticipated an audience when Annie Aronburg, his character, says ''she will have all the battle manuscripts 'published as soon as I can, so the world shall know.' '' Darger noted in his 15,000-page novel that ''editors of great experience will in due time be allowed to go over the whole work most carefully.''</p>
        <p>Some people think that Darger even anticipated other artists. His ''use of cut-outs from magazines, comic strips and coloring books prefigures the same kind of appropriations by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein,'' Mr. Bonesteel observes. And Ms. Kallir says: ''Darger was an unwitting postmodernist, though he couldn't have conceived what that was. He saw behind the facade of mid-century prosperity and propriety. He deconstructed those cutesy images and saw the sexuality and truth behind them.''</p>
        <p>When Darger was a boy, his nickname was Crazy. These days he is embraced with the term outsider. His tombstone offers another alternative: ''Henry Darger, 1892-1973, Artist, Protector of Children.''</p>
