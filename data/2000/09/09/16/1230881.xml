        <p>With so much attention focused these days on the issues and personalities in the presidential race, it is too often forgotten that a record fund-raising campaign is being waged by the candidates with far less public scrutiny. Once again big unregulated donations from corporations, unions and rich individuals are pouring into party treasuries and being used for campaigns in violation of the campaign laws. Whether it is the Democrats getting money from trial lawyers for killing a bill that would curb personal-injury lawsuits, or Republicans getting money from corporations to get such a bill passed, the ''soft money'' loophole has corrupted the whole political system.</p>
        <p>According to Common Cause, the parties raised $256 million in soft money in the first 18 months of this election cycle, more than 80 percent ahead of what they raised in the comparable period of time four years ago. The White House, moreover, has acknowledged that President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton are once again having sleepovers for major donors to Mrs. Clinton's Senate race. The Times reported last week that the Democrats had raised $4 million in huge chunks from a handful of powerful Texas trial lawyers in the years since Mr. Clinton's veto of legislation that would have curbed the amount of money people could win in lawsuits over faulty products.

        <p>With so much attention focused these days on the issues and personalities in the presidential race, it is too often forgotten that a record fund-raising campaign is being waged by the candidates with far less public scrutiny. Once again big unregulated donations from corporations, unions and rich individuals are pouring into party treasuries and being used for campaigns in violation of the campaign laws. Whether it is the Democrats getting money from trial lawyers for killing a bill that would curb personal-injury lawsuits, or Republicans getting money from corporations to get such a bill passed, the ''soft money'' loophole has corrupted the whole political system.</p>
        <p>According to Common Cause, the parties raised $256 million in soft money in the first 18 months of this election cycle, more than 80 percent ahead of what they raised in the comparable period of time four years ago. The White House, moreover, has acknowledged that President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton are once again having sleepovers for major donors to Mrs. Clinton's Senate race. The Times reported last week that the Democrats had raised $4 million in huge chunks from a handful of powerful Texas trial lawyers in the years since Mr. Clinton's veto of legislation that would have curbed the amount of money people could win in lawsuits over faulty products. A Justice Department investigation is under way to see if any bribery statutes were violated.</p>
        <p>Responding to the Times article, Gov. George W. Bush rightly deplored the Democrats for milking the trial lawyers over this issue. What he left out is that he has made ''tort reform'' -- as Republicans like to call the curbs on personal injury lawsuits -- a centerpiece of his campaign. On the Republican side, millions of dollars have been raised from businesses that would stand to benefit from restrictions on the right to sue. Mr. Bush's opposition to the right to sue health maintenance organizations in particular is reaping huge sums of money from the insurance industry.</p>
        <p>What all this amounts to is institutionalized influence peddling. Also, in our view and that of many experts, the way soft money is being used is often illegal. The law restricts the use of such funds to so-called party-building activities. In the past, presidential campaigns have contended that using them for ads was all right, as long as the candidates themselves were not involved in producing the ads. But the evidence showed that President Clinton was closely involved in the ads four years ago, and Governor Bush's decision to pull an ad a few weeks ago, because he thought it was unfair, showed that he too is connected to the advertising process.</p>
        <p>Last week three longtime advocates of campaign finance reform asked a federal court to rule that these ads, paid for by soft money, were clearly coordinated with the candidates and therefore represented an illegal campaign contribution. The three are Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21; Scott Harshbarger, president of Common Cause; and Archibald Cox, the former Watergate prosecutor. They note that in order to receive $68 million in public funds, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore signed a written agreement not to accept other contributions or make any other expenditures for their campaigns except for a small amount for party expenditures on their behalf.</p>
        <p>The general counsel of the Federal Election Commission has found that party ad campaigns coordinated with a presidential candidate constitute a contribution to, and an expenditure by, the candidates themselves. But the commission members, who are political appointees of the parties, blocked that ruling. Because of the commission's failure, supporters of reform will have to get the law rewritten.</p>
        <p>The McCain-Feingold soft-money ban has twice passed in the House but been blocked by a filibuster led by the Republican leadership in the Senate. Congress must outlaw soft money. Voluntary renunciation of its use would also help. In his debate with Mrs. Clinton last Wednesday, Representative Rick Lazio was right to call for such a voluntary ban, but Mrs. Clinton was right to insist that it encompass attack ads by the parties in Washington and by outside groups. In the end, short of Congressional action, the courts should step in and make clear that the law does not allow this corrupt practice to continue.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 20, 2000, Wednesday  An editorial last Saturday erred in saying that Gov. George W. Bush opposes the right to sue health maintenance organizations. The Bush campaign says that its candidate favors a patient's right to sue provided that the claim is first reviewed by an independent medical panel.</p>
