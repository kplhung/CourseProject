        <p>Like other prostate cancer patients deciding on treatment, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had to weigh both medical and personal factors. In choosing to have radioactive pellets implanted in his prostate yesterday morning, he selected an effective treatment with far fewer side effects than surgery.</p>
        <p>But the procedure, called brachytherapy and carried out with hollow needles inserted into the prostate, offers less assurance of a cure than the removal of the prostate.</p>
        <p>''People choose brachytherapy because it is less disruptive to day-to-day activities than either surgery or external beam radiation,'' said Dr. E. Darracott Vaughan Jr., chairman of urology at New York Weill Cornell Center in Manhattan. ''You walk in, get it done, and then you go home.''</p>
        <p>Patients often can return to work within a couple of days, as Mr. Giuliani says he plans to do.</p>
        <p>In addition, no surgical incision is required, and the risk of sexual dysfunction is probably lower than that for surgery, which can injure critical nerves in the pelvis. Experts say the procedure involves almost no risk of urinary incontinence, a problem that occurs in approximately 60 percent of patients who have surgery.</p>
        <p>''If a small degree of incontinence is devastating for a patient, you're not doing them any favor by curing their cancer but destroying their quality of life,'' said Dr. Mendel Shemtov, an assistant professor of urology at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University.</p>
        <p>In addition, prostate removal usually requires a patient to spend several days in the hospital and to restrict activities like heavy lifting for several weeks. External beam radiation, another option, usually requires patients to receive treatment almost every day for six to eight weeks, and their doctors usually insist that they stay close to home.</p>
        <p>While prostate removal appears to be more successful in eliminating the cancer, the pellet procedure can still be considered highly effective,  according to Dr. Vaughan, at least based on data. A recent study of 219 patients who received the pellets showed that 70 percent had no evidence of cancer after 10 years. The results of that study, conducted at the Northwest Prostate Institute in Seattle, were published in July in the journal Cancer. According to Dr. Vaughan, the rates for similar patients 10 years after surgery are 85 to 90 percent.</p>
        <p>For the pellet procedure, which is done under local anesthesia, about 50 to 100 radioactive pellets are implanted into the prostate. The pellets, each about the size of a small rice grain, are passed through hollow needles inserted through the skin between the scrotum and rectum and guided into place with the help of X-rays and ultrasound. The exact location of the pellets is decided through imaging studies, using CAT scans and M.R.I., and computer calculations.</p>
        <p>While the mayor was told that he should not come into close contact with pregnant women or small children because of the radiation, Dr. Datta Nori, chief of radiation oncology at Weill Cornell, said that there was virtually no risk to other people because the radiation from the pellets extended only about half an inch.</p>
        <p>The amount of radiation delivered depends on the particular radioactive isotope. Isotopes of iodine, palladium and gold are commonly used.  Mr. Giuliani received palladium pellets. Palladium's half-life -- the time it takes for half its radiation to be emitted -- is 17 days, while iodine's is 60 days, meaning that palladium delivers its radiation much faster.</p>
        <p>After the pellets stop being radioactive, Mr. Giuliani will receive radiation treatment from an external source, which improves long-term survival rates, his doctors said.</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Nori, a beam of  radiation from a machine is directed at the prostate to treat any cancer in the surrounding tissue. Many patients get external radiation treatments after brachytherapy. If radiation treatment fails, surgery is still an option.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani will continue to take Lupron, a drug that inhibits the production of sex hormones that stimulate prostate growth, including testosterone. The drug and its counterparts are often used as a first-line treatment. Prostate cancer can, however, become resistant to hormonal modulation after a few years.</p>
        <p>Experts say that brachytherapy is  effective only for patients with less aggressive cancer that has not spread outside the prostate. But they warned about drawing any conclusions about the mayor's disease based upon the treatment he had selected.</p>
