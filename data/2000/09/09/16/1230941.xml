        <p>Nancy Johnson said she had planned to walk in the parade of American Olympians at Friday night's opening ceremony, but changed her mind because she knew the ceremony would end late and athletes would not return to the athletes' village until well past midnight. Because her event, the 10-meter air rifle competition, began at 9 a.m. today, Johnson decided at the last minute to remain in the athletes' village.</p>
        <p>''Someone said to me that the opening ceremonies are nice,'' she said, ''but a medal hanging around your neck the next morning will change your life forever.''</p>
        <p>Johnson's decision was fortuitous. As kangaroo bounded across acres of nearby park, she won the first gold medal of the 2000 Olympic Summer Games.</p>
        <p>Johnson, 26, of Downers Grove, Ill., narrowly defeated Kang Cho-hyun of South Korea by two-tenths of a point at the new $30 million International Shooting Center built in a pastoral, agricultural region called the Cumberland Plain, 15 miles west of Sydney.</p>
        <p>Gao Jing of China, a favorite in the event, won the bronze medal.</p>
        <p>''Winning the first medal is pretty cool,'' said Johnson, who finished 36th in the event at the 1996 Atlanta Games and became the first American to win an air-rifle medal in the event since 1984. ''It's extra special, no doubt.''</p>
        <p>The 10-meter air rifle is a tense and precise event usually dominated by the Chinese and women from the former Eastern bloc countries.</p>
        <p>Competitors vie to hit a bull's-eye that is just half a millimeter wide, with the difference between first and eighth place measured in tenths of millimeters.</p>
        <p>Johnson began shooting at age 15. She had wanted to try archery but there wasn't a local range near her home. Instead, her father, Ben Napolski, brought her to a nearby shooting range where there was a junior rifle club.</p>
        <p>Napolski was at today's competition, dashing around the indoor grandstand to greet Johnson moments after her victory was assured.</p>
        <p>''He looked in my eyes and was very emotional, very teary,'' Johnson said. ''He just said, 'I'm so proud of you.' ''</p>
        <p>Johnson built an early lead in the final of the event -- when each competitor fires 10 shots -- and barely hung on as Gao registered the highest scores in the field during the final two shots.</p>
        <p>Disappointed because she was in fifth place after the qualifying round, Johnson said she consulted with her husband, Ken, who told her that he thought she might be swaying on the shooting range.</p>
        <p>''He just said to check my position at the line, I was swaying back and forth,'' Johnson said. ''I adjusted and everything was better. I was very calm and composed for most of the event really.''</p>
        <p>Ken Johnson, who is scheduled to compete in the men's 10-meter air rifle event on Monday, is a United States Army marksman, part of an elite competition unit based in Georgia's Fort Benning.</p>
        <p>Sonja Pfeilschifter, the world champion in the event, finished a surprising fifth.</p>
        <p>Of Pfeilschifter, Johnson said: ''She went out there with a very grim look on her face and I went out there with a smile, determined to do my best.''</p>
        <p>If the international shooting center, surrounded by wildlife and environmentally sensitive terrain, is far from the teeming crowds and excitement of downtown Sydney, it did not lack for Olympic pageantry today. Johnson was feted with bouquets and honored by a small but cheering audience during her medal ceremony, which concluded with the playing of the American national anthem.</p>
        <p>International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch was expected to present the medals to the winners but canceled his appearance. Olegario Vazquez Rana, the chief of the International Shooting Sport Federation, presided over the ceremony in Samaranch's absence.</p>
        <p>From an original field of 55, Jayme Dickman, 23, of South Bend, Ind., also made it to the finals, finishing sixth.</p>
