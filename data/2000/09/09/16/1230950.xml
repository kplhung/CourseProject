        <p>The Devils have been in training camp for a week. But Jason Arnott and Scott Niedermayer, the team's unsigned restricted free agents, have yet to make an appearance and there is no reason to think they will any time soon.</p>
        <p>Lou Lamoriello, the president and general manager of the Devils, confirmed yesterday that he had broken off negotiations with the two players.</p>
        <p>''We made it clear that things had to be worked out before training camp,'' Lamoriello said. ''It's not my problem the way their cases are presented to the media.''</p>
        <p>Both players are represented by Don Meehan of Toronto. Meehan told reporters on Thursday that Lamoriello had made his final offer to the two players that day, but Lamoriello said yesterday at the team's training facility in West Orange, N.J., that he had made his final offer before training camp.</p>
        <p>Lamoriello would not confirm what his final offer was for each player. Niedermayer made $3.25 million last year and Arnott made $1.8 million. Niedermayer is seeking between $4 and $5 million a season and Arnott wants between $3.5 and $4 million.</p>
        <p>Lamoriello also confirmed that the two players are being fined for every day they miss training camp. He said they will incur a bigger fine for each day they miss in the regular season, which starts Oct. 6.</p>
        <p>''The reason for that,'' Lamoriello said of the fines, ''is to respect those who are here.''</p>
        <p>A year ago, Lamoriello, who is known for being tough at contract time, took a hard line in contract negotiations with Brendan Morrison and Patrik Elias, who missed the first eight games of the regular season before reluctantly agreeing to what was already on the table. Later during the season, Morrison and Denis Pederson were traded to Vancouver for Alexander Mogilny.</p>
        <p>The Devils start their preseason schedule tonight with a game against Pittsburgh at Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and visit the Detroit Red Wings tomorrow. Chris Terreri will start in goal against Pitsburgh and Martin Brodeur will start in Detroit.</p>
