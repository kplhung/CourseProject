        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>William Safire (column, Sept. 11) writes as if the technical capabilities of the proposed national missile defense system were well established through rigorous testing, and that President Clinton was simply appeasing President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia when he decided to defer deployment of the system.</p>
        <p>However, the interceptor's performance in flight tests has been dismal. There is no basis for confidence that the system would be capable of protecting the United States from even a single nuclear missile launched by any nation. Under the circumstances, it makes no sense to damage our relations with Russia, China and our allies by rushing ahead with such an immature system.</p>
