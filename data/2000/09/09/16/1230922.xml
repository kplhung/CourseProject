        <p>ON a mild, clear Thursday evening, thousands of spectators with a sense of anticipation crowded around Sydney Harbor to celebrate the arrival of the Olympic flame. The opening ceremony would take place the following evening, but Sydney's passions were ignited on this night.</p>
        <p>High above the crowd in a 28th-floor penthouse another flame was building. Muhammad Ali was being introduced to guests at Richard and Jeanne Pratt's apartment. This was an eclectic group that ran from European royalty to Derek Denton, the world's foremost authority on the effects of salt on the body. There were businessmen and Aboriginal activists. They all greeted Ali with applause and cheers.</p>
        <p>The guests, enjoying a breathtaking view of Sydney Harbor and the Opera House, looked at the Olympic rings in huge lights on the Sydney Harbor Bridge. Inside the apartment, they watched two flat-screen monitors showing highlights of Ali's boxing career: the brash youngster defeating Sonny Liston and the first super fight with Joe Frazier.</p>
        <p>Ali's presence in Sydney was arranged by Anthony Pratt, the chairman of Pratt Industries USA, an American subsidiary of Visy Industries Worldwide, an Australian paper recycling company. Pratt befriended Ali four years ago and invited The Greatest to Australia.</p>
        <p>Much like the Olympic torch, Ali followed a meandering path in Australia. On Monday, he was in Melbourne, where he met 1,000 homeless children and spoke with workers at a Visy Industries plant.</p>
        <p>Tuesday, he was in Adelaide. Ali, despite the visible effects of Parkinson's disease, addressed an audience at another of the company's plants and held a question-and-answer session. One worker asked what was it like to light the Olympic flame at the 1996 Games in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''Scary as hell,'' Ali said. ''My left hand was shaking because of Parkinson's, my right hand was shaking from fear. Somehow, between the two of them, I got the thing lit.''</p>
        <p>Someone else asked Ali about his toughest opponent. ''U.S. military,'' he said. ''Next toughest fight was my first wife.''</p>
        <p>Early Thursday, Ali made an appearance at Rosehill Gardens race track in Sydney. He had lunch with Rupert Murdoch, barely saying a word as other guests made small talk. Then, out of the blue, Ali looked at Murdoch and asked, ''What did Lincoln say after being drunk for three days?''</p>
        <p>Murdoch said he did not know.</p>
        <p>''I freed the who?''</p>
        <p>Thursday night, there were no speeches, but plenty of pictures. The testimony came in private, reflective conversations.</p>
        <p>Like so many other people, Anthony Pratt, who is 40, was touched by Ali long before he met him. The first time he saw Ali fight was the ''Rumble in the Jungle'' in Zaire in 1974, when Ali defeated George Foreman. Pratt was introduced to Ali in January 1996 before the Atlanta Games by Mel Blount, the Hall of Fame cornerback for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Ali came to Pratt's wedding in 1997 in New York. Pratt is on the board of the proposed Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, Ky., which would be both a museum celebrating his career and a center to promote world peace.</p>
        <p>Geoff Clark, the chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, was at Pratt's apartment on Thursday evening. Earlier in the day, Clark had been at the Sydney news media center for a panel discussion on indigenous issues. Now he was here with his son to meet Ali.</p>
        <p>Clark remembered a visit by Ali to Melbourne in 1983. ''He made a point of jumping in his limo, coming around and meeting the Aboriginal people,'' Clark said. ''Thousands of people flocked to him, because they understood what he was representing. He was representing the aspiration; he was the champion of their aspiration.''</p>
        <p>Gerald Brennan drove nine hours from his home in Moree to shake the hand of a man he had admired since 1964, when Ali defeated Liston to become heavyweight champion.</p>
        <p>''We had no TV; we were all around a radio, 40, 50 of us,'' Brennan recalled. Moree at the time was a small Aboriginal center.</p>
        <p>''We weren't allowed in the swimming pool,'' said Brennan, who is an Aborigine. ''It was all right for me to go and represent my school in the relay breaststroke, but soon as it came down past 3, when school was out, we had to get out.''</p>
        <p>Brennan said he was deeply inspired when Ali refused to be inducted into the United States Army. ''He stood there as if to say to us, 'You can do this if you get off your back and have a go, too,' '' Brennan said. ''And then to see him fight discrimination in America and that, you sort of say, 'Yeah, yeah, that's what's happening here,' and 'Why shouldn't we be allowed to swim in the pool at our own leisure instead of waiting during the week to represent the school to help them win a shield?'</p>
        <p>''When Ali stood up to be counted, and wanted to express his beliefs, he taught us that we could say 'No' to something that we didn't believe in. He was right. We didn't have to be tagging along, following other people.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday morning in his hotel room, Ali said he was touched by the excitement in Sydney, because it reminded him of how he had felt in Atlanta. ''Hard to believe that it was four years ago,'' he said.</p>
        <p>We spoke briefly and then Ali looked at me and asked: ''What's your name?'' I knew he knew my name and I knew where this was headed. I wanted to say, ''I don't know,'' but didn't. Finally, I told him my name.</p>
        <p>''That's not your name,'' Ali said. ''That's your slave name.'' And in two minutes, Muhammad Ali, in a muted, deliberate cadence, recited the history of all those subdued, all those conquered, all those lost. He put me in my place, or rather, in my proper context within Australia, with the Aboriginal people, whose land and history had been stolen, disfigured and obscured.</p>
        <p>Long ago Ali changed his name and rediscovered himself. Armed with this knowledge of self, he began a journey toward truth and global reconciliation. How fitting that Ali would be in Sydney for the opening of the first Olympic Games of a new millennium.</p>
        <p>He is the torch that lights the way.</p>
