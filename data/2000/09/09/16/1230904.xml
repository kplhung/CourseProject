        <p>Following are excerpts from answers by President Clinton and the White House press secretary, Joe Lockhart, to questions today about the case of the former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription agency:</p>
        <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON</p>
        <p>Q. What do you say to Asian-Americans who are concerned that his ethnicity may have played some role in the fact he was detained?</p>
        <p>MR. CLINTON -- No, no. First of all, I don't believe that. I don't think there's any evidence of that. Let's look at the facts here. He has admitted to a very serious national security violation, and the most important thing now is that he keep his commitment to the government to work hard to figure out what happened to those tapes, what was on the tapes, to reconstitute all the information. That's very important.</p>
        <p>In America, we have a pretty high standard -- and we should -- under our Constitution, against pretrial detention. You have to meet a pretty high bar. I had no reason to believe that that bar had not been met.</p>
        <p>I think the fact that there was, that in a short time frame there was an argument that he needed to stay in jail without bail, and then all of a sudden there was a plea agreement which was inconsistent with the claims that they made. I thought that raises the question, not just for Chinese-Americans, but for all Americans, about whether we have been as careful as we ought to be about pretrial detention. And that's something that, you know, in a government like ours that is basically forged out of the concern for abuse of executive authority, we sometimes make mistakes, but we normally make mistakes the other way, where we're bending over backwards.</p>
        <p>Our staff has talked to the Justice Department about it. I'm sure I'll have a chance to talk to the attorney general. It would have been completely inappropriate for me to intervene, and I don't believe she intervened. This was handled in the appropriate, normal way. But I want you to understand, there was a serious violation here. He has acknowledged that. We have to get to the bottom of what was on all the tapes. But the narrow thing that I want to illustrate here is that when the United States, whenever we hold anybody in prison who can't get bail or who is interned for a long period of time before being charged and convicted and sentenced, we need to hit a very high threshold. That is the specific thing I wanted to focus on, and I think that there ought to be an analysis of whether or not that threshold was crossed, in light of the plea bargain.</p>
        <p>MR. LOCKHART</p>
        <p>It's certainly our hope, although it is not a hope that we genuinely believe anything will be done about, that others will take some time and do some examination. I think there was a climate of, a very difficult climate that was generated in this town when this story came out, a climate generated by some very explosive and near hysterical investigative reporting, a climate that was fueled by explosive comments from political leaders, including members of Congress. And I hope everybody takes a moment, looks at how they handled this situation and looks to see if in the future they can do better, just as, I think, the executive branch will do.</p>
        <p>Q. Joe, do you believe that the media reporting and the explosive atmosphere that you described affected the prosecutor's decisions on which charges to bring and how this case would ----</p>
        <p>MR. LOCKHART -- That would be a question you'd have to put to the prosecutors, and they will stand up, I'm certain, and answer their questions. It's certainly my hope that those who wrote the stories will also be willing to stand up and talk about their motivations and whether there's anything they can learn . . .</p>
        <p>Q. Is there any thought being given to contacting Mr. Lee and making any kind of formal apology?</p>
        <p>A. Well, I think, given the limited and the proper role and hands-off role that was played here by the White House, there's no discussion of that. I think the president's obligation, as he addressed directly yesterday and then again this morning, was when questions are raised, when they are legitimate questions, when people are troubled by things -- and he, indeed, is troubled himself by some of these questions -- we should look at it. We should look at it and see what it is we can learn from this experience and see what, if anything, needs to be done to improve in the future.</p>
        <p>Q. So who should apologize in this case here?</p>
        <p>A. I don't know.</p>
