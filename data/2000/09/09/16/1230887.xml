        <p>Joseph I. Lieberman campaigned in Coney Island on behalf of Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday, offering testimony to her character and commitment to Israel.

        <p>Joseph I. Lieberman campaigned in Coney Island on behalf of Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday, offering testimony to her character and commitment to Israel. Her aides hope it will be the first in a series of New York appearances by the Democratic vice presidential candidate over the next two months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman also spoke about his own campaign, and about the Democratic Party's candidate for the White House, Al Gore. But yesterday's event had little to do with presidential politics in New York, where Democrats are confident of Mr. Gore's chances against Gov. George W. Bush, and much to do with Mrs. Clinton's tighter Senate contest against Representative Rick A. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's stature in New York prompted the first lady's aides to press him to campaign for her. Mrs. Clinton beamed as Mr. Lieberman, the first Jew selected by a major party to run for vice president, praised her political skills and her faith.</p>
        <p>''This is a very gifted person, she was given some gifts, talents, by God,'' Mr. Lieberman said.</p>
        <p>''There is just no one I would trust more to fight for you, your children and your future than Hillary Rodham Clinton,'' he said while sitting with the first lady in a library at Mark Twain Intermediate School 239 in Brooklyn. ''She is a woman of principle and of faith.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman offered his affirmation of Mrs. Clinton's character at a time when Mr. Lazio has repeatedly attacked her as untrustworthy. Although he never mentioned Mr. Lazio's name, he repeatedly used the word ''trust'' in talking about Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''The people of New York can count on her to constantly fight against discrimination, to fight for principles, to be for the right thing,'' he said. ''I would say to people in New York who care about the future of the state of Israel, I have been through this so many times, not just in a public way, but in a private way, and believe me, Hillary Clinton as a United States senator will be a strong, strong supporter of the state of Israel.</p>
        <p>''The word tolerance doesn't do it justice,'' he said. ''This is a woman without a bias in her being.''</p>
