        <p>President Clinton said today that he did not believe Wen Ho Lee was singled out for prosecution because he was Chinese-American, but said he planned to talk to the attorney general about concerns that the Los Alamos nuclear scientist was not treated properly by prosecutors.</p>
        <p>Aides said Mr. Clinton would discuss the government's handling of the case with the attorney general, Janet Reno, at the White House next week. Today, in an appearance with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the president said it would have been wrong for him to express his concerns to Ms. Reno while charges were pending.</p>
        <p>''It would have been completely inappropriate for me to intervene,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>White House aides also sought to assign some responsibility for the pressures that propelled the prosecution forward to the news media, especially The New York Times, and to members of Congress. [Excerpts, Page A12.]</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee, who had been in solitary confinement for nine months while awaiting trial, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to one count of improperly handling classified information. Under a plea deal that represented a collapse of the government's case, prosecutors dropped 58 other counts, and the judge in Albuquerque freed Dr. Lee from the Santa Fe County Jail, harshly criticizing the prosecution for its handling of the case.</p>
        <p>Since then, the administration has been fielding questions about Dr. Lee's treatment, including whether he had been unfairly singled out because of his Chinese ancestry. While Ms. Reno defended the Justice Department's conduct, Mr. Clinton said he was ''quite troubled'' by the department's behavior.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Clinton sought to soften the sting of his words, but he said he would continue to review the case. And some of his aides strongly criticized media coverage.</p>
        <p>Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said, there was ''a very difficult climate that was generated in this town when this story came out, a climate generated by some very explosive and near hysterical investigative reporting, a climate that was fueled by explosive comments from political leaders, including members of Congress.''</p>
        <p>Aides said they had not heard the president express concern about the media's role. But they said Mr. Clinton has expressed concern for weeks,  in private, about whether Dr. Lee was treated fairly.</p>
        <p>Today, at the urging of aides, Mr. Clinton stressed the seriousness of the charges against Dr. Lee.</p>
        <p>''He has admitted to a very serious national security violation,'' he said. ''And the most important thing now is that he keep his commitment to the government to work hard to figure out what happened to those tapes, what was on the tapes, to reconstitute all the information.''</p>
        <p>Under the plea deal, Dr. Lee agreed to tell prosecutors why he downloaded the nuclear secrets onto computer tapes, exactly what he did with the information and whether anyone else had seen it.</p>
        <p>The judge in the case, James A. Parker of Federal District Court in Albuquerque, said on Wednesday that Dr. Lee deserved an apology for harsh treatment that had ''embarrassed our entire nation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton reiterated his doubts today about whether officials had been sensitive enough to prohibitions against the ''abuse of executive authority'' when they sought to keep Dr. Lee in jail without bail.</p>
        <p>Sitting beside Mr. Vajpayee in the Oval Office, Mr. Clinton offered a primer on jurisprudence.</p>
        <p>''In America, we have a pretty high standard, and we should, under our Constitution, against pretrial detention,'' the president said. ''You have to meet a pretty high bar. I had no reason to believe that that bar had not been met. I think the fact that there was, that in a short time frame there was an argument that he needed to stay in jail without bail, and then all of a sudden there was a plea agreement which was inconsistent with the claims that they made. I thought that raises the question, not just for Chinese-Americans, but for all Americans, about whether we have been as careful as we ought to be about pretrial detention.''</p>
        <p>White House aides said Mr. Clinton was not directing his criticism at any officials in particular, including Ms. Reno and Director Louis J. Freeh of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Asked if the president was trying to signal that he wanted the resignations of Ms. Reno or Mr. Freeh, Jake Siewert, a White House deputy press secretary said: ''No. The president said he had some questions about the handling of this. He's not going to prejudge anything. He will wait until his questions are answered.''</p>
        <p>White House aides said Mr. Clinton has full confidence in Ms. Reno. As for Mr. Freeh, with whom the president has clashed, they said Mr. Clinton's views have not changed since former White House press secretary Mike McCurry said in 1997, ''I think the president has great confidence that Louis Freeh is leading that agency as best he can.''</p>
        <p>In his criticism at today's White House briefing, Mr. Lockhart did not specify news organizations or members of Congress. But Mr. Siewert, who will replace Mr. Lockhart as press secretary next month, later singled out The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Mr. Siewert complained about the newspaper's first article in March 1999 that reported federal investigators' suspicions about an unidentified  computer scientist at Los Alamos who had traveled to Hong Kong. Mr. Siewert pointed out that F.B.I. agents used the article, which quoted a central intelligence official who compared the investigation to the Rosenberg spy case -- to scare Dr. Lee during his interrogation.</p>
        <p>''Reading the New York Times coverage of this case is a particularly surreal experience,'' Mr. Siewert said. ''It's as though William Randolph Hearst were lamenting the human toll caused by the Spanish-American War.''</p>
        <p>In a written statement responding to the White House's complaints, Bill Keller, the managing editor of The Times, said:</p>
        <p>''We are looking back at the full run of our coverage to see how it stands up in light of the latest developments and whether there are lessons to be learned. For now, I'll say this much: We didn't launch an investigation or prosecution of Wen Ho Lee. We reported aggressively on an investigation and prosecution launched by the administration. Many of our sources were within the administration. We reported on the suspicions of those who favored prosecuting Mr. Lee, but we also reported on holes in that investigation, on the allegations of racial profiling, on the doubts about the potential danger of the downloaded material, and on the political motivations of the players.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether they believed news coverage affected prosecutorial decisions, Mr. Lockhart referred questions to the Justice Department. ''That would be a question you would have to put to the prosecutors,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''We didn't pursue this case based on the hype,'' responded Myron Marlin, a spokesman for the Justice Department. ''We pursued it because Dr. Lee created his own personal library of our nation's nuclear secrets.''</p>
