        <p>Squashed for the ninth straight time by Pedro Martinez on a frustrating Thursday night, the Indians dragged themselves onto a plane that carried them from Cleveland to New York, where they could not land because of the rain. The plane circled for several minutes, then flew to Hartford to refuel and finally landed in Newark.</p>
        <p>It was 5 a.m. when the players stumbled into their midtown hotel rooms. Welcome to New York.</p>
        <p>The Indians had a lot to ponder as they tried to sleep a few hours, such as how they can extend their season into October. The Indians are used to talking about the postseason each September because they have had such a huge lead in the American League Central for the last five years that there were hardly any other pertinent questions.</p>
        <p>Now, instead of wondering how far they might advance in the playoffs, the Indians are hoping they can snag the wild card and make it that far. While the Yankees are in such a cozy position that they can rest Bernie Williams, can let Chuck Knoblauch regain his stamina in real games and can let David Cone try to pitch his way onto the postseason roster, the Indians must treat games like they could decide their season. Basically, one game could.</p>
        <p>There are four teams within three games of each other for the wild card and Cleveland was clinging to a one-game lead over the Oakland Athletics going into last night. Last season, the Indians had a 24 1/2-game cushion in their division at this point and were relaxing even more than the Yankees are now. So these are drastically different challenges for a revamped team that looked bewildered in early August.</p>
        <p>''It's not driving us crazy,'' Jim Thome said. ''It's a lot of fun. We've never been through this type of pennant race, fighting from beginning to end. It's a little different from the past. I think what's crazy is the unknown. We don't know what's going to happen.''</p>
        <p>No one does, but the Indians will know a lot more about their fate next Thursday. By then, the Indians will have finished a four-game series with the Yankees -- which they began with an 11-0 rout of New York last night -- and will have played five games in three days against the Red Sox, who were perched two games behind them last night. For once, the Indians need a mad sprint in September and that should be a good thing.</p>
        <p>As successful as the Indians have been in reaching the World Series twice in the last five years, they have never had to play crucial games in September. Thome spoke about the excitement of having a ''playoff atmosphere'' every night, something that never happened until there actually was a playoff game.</p>
        <p>''I honestly believe we'll be better in the postseason if we get there because we would have battled through September,'' Thome said.</p>
        <p>The Indians have used 31 pitchers this season and still have five on the disabled list; they traded David Justice, their most productive hitter, to the Yankees; and they realistically gave up hopes of catching the first-place White Sox weeks ago. But Manny Ramirez has been one of the most valuable hitters in the major leagues since the All-Star Game, David Segui was acquired from Texas and has replaced Justice, and Bob Wickman, obtained from Milwaukee, has saved 10 games.</p>
        <p>''I think they're playing better than most of the other clubs that they're vying with because of where they had to come from,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said. ''I never put them to sleep.''</p>
        <p>When Charlie Manuel was told of Torre's remarks, he laughed softly and said that he wished he could treat them as gospel. Manuel figured 90 victories would be enough to get a team into the postseason, meaning the Indians need to win 12 of their last 19 games. The Indians have won 34 of their last 57, but they have the most grueling schedule of any teams chasing the wild card.</p>
        <p>''We got to play some kind of baseball,'' Manuel said.</p>
        <p>It has to start against the Yankees, who have tormented the Indians by winning 33 of the last 51 regular-season games between them. The Yankees have won three of the last four World Series, but the Indians sent them home in 1997 and gave them the most trouble in the postseason in 1998. Wickman, a former Yankee,  tried to explain the daunting nature of playing at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>''It's the confidence they have when they go out on the home turf,'' Wickman said. ''It's like when the Packers were good. They knew no one was going to win on Lambeau Field. These guys know that no one is going to come in here and take a series from them.''</p>
        <p>But the Indians must beat the Yankees this weekend in games that mean a lot more to them. If the Indians keep clawing and eventually win the wild card, they might feel even prouder then in years when they sealed a spot in July. But that feeling would linger about an hour because the Yankees would be waiting in the division series. There will be no welcome signs out then, either.</p>
        <p>''If we get to that point, we'll worry about it then,'' Thome said. ''We're not used to watching it on TV. We haven't had to do that yet.''</p>
