        <p>It is a scene from the old, peaceful days before the Yugoslav wars: a beach crammed with overweight bodies, children whizzing down water slides, people eating packed lunches from plastic bags and fantastically loud music pumping out of loudspeakers. A holiday from hell for some, but Croatia's seaside resorts -- largely dormant for 10 years -- are booming again.</p>
        <p>Farther down the coast, the cafe crowd watch the evening light turn golden over the tiled roofs of the medieval walled city of Dubrovnik, as children skid around on the polished white flagstones of the main square. In the churches and museums, American voices mingle with Italian and French, and students with cruise-ship passengers.</p>
        <p>All along the Adriatic coast, the old Yugoslavia's best asset and biggest foreign currency earner, the tourists are back in great numbers and are lifting hopes. Croatia's myriad islands were once the main destination of vacationers on package tours from the Communist bloc, as well as middle-class visitors from Western Europe. Now the dramatic coastline and pristine sea -- arguably the least spoiled in the Mediterranean -- are being rediscovered by a new generation of vacationers.</p>
        <p>''Tourism is coming back to what it was,'' said Mili Razovic, head of the Tourist Board in the main port of Split, with a sigh and a smile. ''We are surprised about the figures ourselves.''</p>
        <p>Left without customers during the war, their hotels and resorts given over to refugees and some of their architectural gems blasted by shellfire, tourist officials here can barely believe the resurgence of business.</p>
        <p>More than 1.3 million visited Croatia in the first six months of this year, and by mid-August numbers had topped the 1998 total, according to the Ministry of Tourism in Zagreb. Numbers are close to 80 percent of prewar figures, Mr. Razovic said.</p>
        <p>Finance Minister Mato Crkvenac estimated in the Croatian news media that tourism would bring in some $3.2 billion by year's end. For a country of 4.5 million with 20 percent unemployment, and an economy largely bankrupted by the previous regime, that is good news.</p>
        <p>The last normal season for the tourism industry here was in 1990, when the old Yugoslavia was still intact. The following year, as first Slovenia and then Croatia seceded, Yugoslav forces laid siege to the fabled city of Dubrovnik, the jewel of the coast and a Unesco World Heritage Site. In 1992 war erupted in Bosnia; throughout the decade, Kosovo simmered, before erupting into NATO's first air war in 1999. Year after year, the tourists who had brought in some $4 billion annually before the bloodshed stayed away.</p>
        <p>Last year Croatia suffered even though it was some considerable distance from Kosovo. Only the Slovenes, themselves once part of Yugoslavia, realized it was safe and kept coming in increased numbers.</p>
        <p>It is the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks and Slovenes who have led the return to the Croatian coast -- which in Communist years was East Europeans' best hope of a Mediterranean vacation. Yugoslavia was affordable and, as a Communist country, not part of the bad capitalist West.</p>
        <p>They have filled up the resort hotels at Vodice and beach resorts around Sibenik, halfway down the Adriatic coast. This August there was not a room to be had, the camping grounds were full and the beaches choked with vacationers.</p>
        <p>Vodice's Hotel Olympia, a pink concrete Communist-era structure, opened its doors on Aug. 5 for the first time in 10 years. For most of that time it had housed hundreds of Croatian refugees, displaced by the war from their villages inland. The Penta Hotel around the bay was occupied by the military and became a barracks, said Ofelia Perzovc, manager of the hotels.</p>
        <p>Two years ago the refugees and the soldiers finally left, and she wrangled some money from the state to renovate the buildings. The Olympia is still a sorry place. One annex, the swimming pool and the grounds are a mess, with smashed windows and graffiti as reminders of its recent past. Yet the tourists seem happy, plunging into the sea and soaking up the sun as if they have never had the chance before.</p>
        <p>''They are known as the tomato tourists,'' said one British resident who used to work in tourism. Asking to remain anonymous, she explained that the visitors from former Eastern bloc countries tended to bring their own food with them to cut down on costs. ''There's even a joke here about a family sharing a single tomato on the beach,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But joking apart, these are the visitors who can help Croatia's tourism  -- a vital support for a new government that has discovered since succeeding the nationalist regime of the late Franjo Tudjman that Croatia is heavily in debt and its economy a shambles.</p>
        <p>Aside perhaps from Dubrovnik, Croatia is barely on the map for many West Europeans.</p>
        <p>''There are people who do not know that Croatia is safe,'' said Nada Maric, manager of the Villa Dubrovnik, probably the country's most elegant hotel, set among terraced gardens above the sea. ''Most people who come say their friends asked, 'Are you crazy?' But actually it is very safe. You can walk at night completely safely.''</p>
        <p>With the tourists back on her terrace, she said that the most dangerous times, during the siege of Dubrovnik in 1991, now seem like a bad dream. The hotel became the headquarters of the defense of the city and came under fire repeatedly, she said.</p>
        <p>''We had 150 refugees here, then the military,'' Ms. Maric added. ''The top general was living here, the place was full of weapons.''</p>
        <p>Yugoslav warships out in front of the city fired on the hotel, she said. When they could not hit it since it was so low-lying, Serbian gunners on the hill above started raining mortars on them.</p>
        <p>The city was without water and electricity for months, and people ran the gantlet of shellfire to fetch supplies. They watched with horror as shells rained on the Baroque churches and Renaissance palaces in the walled city across the water.</p>
        <p>There, nine houses were gutted by fire, among them a former nobleman's residence called the Festival Palace, and more than 70 percent of the tiled roofs were damaged, said Dubravka Zvrko of the Institute for the Restoration of Dubrovnik. Repairing structures, carvings and facades has cost $11 million, she said, and the work is only two-thirds done.</p>
        <p>Yet today only the observant can spot the mortar craters in the hard white Korcula limestone paving beneath the visitors' feet. ''Dubrovnik,'' Ms. Maric mused, ''is slowly coming back into its own.''</p>
