        <p>President Abdurrahman Wahid ordered the arrest today of the youngest son of former President Suharto in connection with a series of deadly bombings, including one on Wednesday that killed 15 people at the Jakarta Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid, who made the announcement at a mosque after Friday Prayers, told worshipers that he had instructed the police to detain Mr. Suharto's son, Hutomo Mandela Putra, 38, a prominent businessman known as Tommy. He is also a central figure in the investigation into the corrupt practices of his father's 32-year dictatorship, which ended in 1998, after Indonesia's economic collapse.</p>
        <p>''I have ordered the Jakarta police chief to arrest Tommy Suharto,'' Mr. Wahid said. ''Even though there is no evidence, he has to be arrested to avoid repeat bombings.''</p>
        <p>The head of the Suharto family legal team, Juan Felix Tampubolon, said today: ''This is the first I've heard about it. I'm on my way to discuss this with the family.''</p>
        <p>In calling for the arrest, Mr. Wahid is seeking to dispel concerns that his government is weak. The president has drawn strong criticism here and abroad for failing to quell the bombings and growing regional and religious violence across the country.</p>
        <p>By late today, the police had not acted on the arrest order, which legally appeared to have no merit. At one point, a spokesman for the police, Nur Usman, who is heading the investigation into the bombing at the stock exchange, said the police would arrest Mr. Suharto today or on Saturday. But this evening Mr. Usman said the police would instead bring him in for questioning, perhaps as early as Saturday, because they did not have any evidence to carry out the Mr. Wahid's decree.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid also called for the arrest of Habib Alwi al-Baaqil, a Muslim cleric and the chairman of Islamic Defense Fund, a pro-Suharto group. But the president acknowledged that there was just widespread suspicion -- not specific evidence -- to link either man to the bombings.</p>
        <p>Government officials have long maintained that political and military extremists linked to Mr. Suharto were behind bombings here and elsewhere that were intended to derail the corruption trial of the former dictator.</p>
        <p>It remains unclear exactly what prompted Mr. Wahid to call for the arrests, though mounting protests outside Mr. Suharto's house here and the nervousness of international investors were most likely contributing factors.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters this afternoon, the president said the government had information about who had planted the bomb at the stock exchange, which he said was just one of several planned targets, the state-run Antara news agency reported.</p>
        <p>''There is a telephone tape recording which revealed that several places have been targeted for explosions,'' Antara quoted Mr. Wahid as saying.</p>
        <p>In July, a bomb exploded in the compound of the attorney general's office an hour after Mr. Suharto had been questioned in the investigation into his father. The night before Mr. Suharto's trial started on Aug. 31, a car bomb exploded near an auditorium in southern Jakarta where the case was to be tried.</p>
        <p>The bombing at the stock exchange, which killed 15 people and injured 28, was on Thursday, a day before the trial was to resume after a two-week delay. Mr. Suharto has not attended.</p>

        <p>Cohen Pressures Jakarta</p>
        <p>MANILA, Sept. 15 (Reuters) --  Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said today that violence in West Timor had to be stemmed and that the government should hold the military accountable for ravaging of East Timor last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen, who arrived here from Washington at the start of a six-nation Asia-Pacific trip, will meet on Monday in Jakarta with President Abdurrahman Wahid and other top Indonesian leaders. The secretary told reporters traveling with him that Indonesia risked international condemnation and continued military isolation from the United States unless it did something about West Timor, where pro-Indonesian militias backed by military factions killed three United Nations aid workers this month.</p>
        <p>''That is going to be an important visit, to remind the president and especially the military, that they need to take strong action to curb the militias in West Timor,'' Mr. Cohen said in an interview in his plane.</p>
        <p>''The situation that has been unfolding in recent days and months is unacceptable,'' he said of the attacks, which have led the United Nations to withdraw workers and threaten thousands of refugees from East Timor with starvation. ''The international community is looking with a very critical eye upon whether President Wahid is going to take the kind of action that is necessary.''</p>
