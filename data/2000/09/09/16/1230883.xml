        <p>Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik is conducting an intensive review of the Police Department's antidrug efforts, focusing on how tens of millions of dollars in overtime are being spent and on the high percentage of minor arrests being made by narcotics detectives, according to several senior law enforcement officials.</p>
        <p>The officials, who are familiar with Mr. Kerik's review, have said he is concerned that misdemeanor narcotics arrests outnumber felony arrests by three to one, an indication that a large number of people charged with drug crimes serve little or no time in jail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik, who served in the department as a narcotics detective for four years, is also reviewing the process by which investigators in the Narcotics Division are promoted to the rank of detective from the rank of police officer, the officials said. Mr. Kerik is concerned that under current department policy, those who fail to perform and produce are promoted alongside those who do.</p>
        <p>''He used to be an undercover cop going out to make these kinds of arrests,'' said one senior law enforcement official who has had discussions with Mr. Kerik about his review. ''Certainly he is aware that the situation is different now.'' The official noted that narcotics enforcement efforts in recent years had driven many dealers off the streets and inside buildings, but added, ''It's hard for him to believe it's so different that the productivity is so low when it comes to meaningful arrests.''</p>
        <p>The official said that Mr. Kerik, who was the commissioner of correction overseeing the city's jails before he was named New York City's 40th police commissioner in August, saw the flood of misdemeanor narcotics arrests when he ran the Department of Correction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik has emphasized that he believes a focus on quality-of-life offenses has helped win record declines in crime, but the officials familiar with his thinking have said he is concerned that some detectives are failing to produce higher-quality cases, like arresting drug dealers.</p>
        <p>''His question is, are some people making easy, quick, low-level collars when they could be making felonies,'' said another senior law enforcement official familiar with the new commissioner's thinking. ''So, with a healthy level of skepticism, he is reviewing all of this.''</p>
        <p>The number of misdemeanor narcotics arrests has been increasing for more than five years, and many police commanders say that pressure within the department to push up arrest numbers has led to a flood of minor drug charges. In fact, since 1993, according to the recently released Mayor's Management Report, narcotics misdemeanors have climbed 295 percent, while narcotics felonies over the same period have decreased 1.1 percent. In fiscal 2000, felony arrests for narcotics dropped 10 percent.</p>
        <p>The changes over the last year, too, have been substantial. During the first six months of this year, Mr. Kerik's predecessor, Howard Safir, poured more than $40 million of police overtime into a special antinarcotics program called Operation Condor, an effort to turn around the city's rising murder rate, which in 1999 and the beginning of this year was inching up.</p>
        <p>For the first three months of this year, Operation Condor put additional undercover narcotics buy-and-bust teams out on the streets in targeted neighborhoods. Starting in May, the overtime funds were spent on additional uniformed patrols and quality-of-life enforcement.</p>
        <p>The result was a significant increase in misdemeanor drug arrests, which include charges ranging from marijuana possession and sale to the possession of the crack residue that is often found in a crack pipe. In the first six months of this year, the police made 60,950 such arrests and 19,787 felony narcotics arrests, according to statistics from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services. During that period in 1999, the police drug arrests included 39,260 misdemeanors drug and 21,604 felonies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik earlier this week praised Operation Condor but said he was reviewing the program. ''I'm looking at it,'' he said in a meeting with reporters on Monday. ''It's been a good program. It's produced good results. How much more do we want to do? Do we want to look at the way it operates? Yes. Am I going to do anything with it now? Not now.''</p>
        <p>Narcotics commanders have said that Mr. Kerik has ordered the department's Quality Assurance Division to request a series of documents from each borough's Narcotics Division in order to assess the quality of the work being done.</p>
        <p>One of his concerns is that some detectives were found to be making just a few undercover drug buys a month that led to felony arrests, but were collecting overtime because of other, low-level arrests.</p>
        <p>Commenting on Commissioner Kerik's review, Assistant Chief Michael Tiffany, who heads Bronx Narcotics, said: ''I think it's wonderful. If you have limited resources, we should be focused on the people who are not only involved in the narcotics trade, but also the attendant violence.''</p>
        <p>Several senior officials also pointed to Mr. Kerik's selection last week of George F. Brown to head the department's Organized Crime Control Bureau, which oversees narcotics, saying the choice was based on Mr. Brown's reputation as an aggressive manager.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik is also seeking to develop management tools to measure the productivity of the department's narcotics efforts, matching overtime and felony-versus-misdemeanor arrest tallies for different parts of the city, according to one senior police official.</p>
        <p>The new commissioner hopes to make some changes to the department's Compstat process, which tracks some measures of activity, like reported crime, arrests, summonses and overtime. But Compstat, unlike his TEAMS management program at the Correction Department, does not provide him with the wide variety of information he feels would better enable him to make the adjustments he needs, the official said.</p>
