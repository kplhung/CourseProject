        <p>The Globe and Mail, Canada's leading national newspaper, the CTV television network, and the nation's top Internet portal are being combined into a new $2.7 billion media powerhouse.</p>
        <p>The Thomson Corporation, the owner of The Globe and Mail, and BCE Inc., whose subsidiaries include the CTV television network and the Sympatico-Lycos Internet service announced the joint venture yesterday.</p>
        <p>BCE will own 70.1 percent of the new company, yet to be named, while Thomson will own 20 percent and the private holding company of Kenneth Thomson, the chairman of Thomson, will put up $275 million for a 9.9 percent stake. The chief executive will be Ivan Fecan, currently president and chief executive of CTV, which BCE, the parent of Bell Canada, acquired for $1.6 billion in February.</p>
        <p>Since Time Warner and America Online announced their merger in January, Canadian media executives have been hurriedly seeking similar combinations.</p>
        <p>In July, the CanWest Global Communications Corporation of Winnipeg, Manitoba, which owns Canada's second-largest private television network, bought most of the Canadian newspapers owned by Conrad Black's Hollinger Inc., including 50 percent of the Globe's main competitor, The National Post, for $2.36 billion. Mr. Black becomes the second-largest shareholder in CanWest, next to its founder, Israel Asper.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, Montreal-based Quebecor Inc., in partnership with the province of Quebec's huge pension fund, bought Group Videotron, which owns the largest cable television company in the province, as well as television stations and video stores. Quebecor owns French-language tabloids in Quebec and The Sun newspaper chain in English-speaking Canada, along with The Sun's popular Canoe Web site.</p>
        <p>By putting The Globe into the new BCE-controlled venture, Thomson is shedding the last of its newspapers. When its 130 North American papers were put up for sale in February, Thomson said it would keep The Globe and its Internet services because they fit with a plan to become solely a publisher of database information for professionals.</p>
        <p>Thomson has since sold all its newspapers in the United States for a total of $2.44 billion, and two of five Canadian papers that were also put on the market.</p>
