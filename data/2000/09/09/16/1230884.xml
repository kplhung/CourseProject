        <p>New York City's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, ended months of deliberation yesterday over the best course of treatment for his prostate cancer by receiving radiation implants at Mount Sinai Medical Center rather than undergoing a more invasive surgical removal of the prostate gland. The mayor had a slew of radiation seeds implanted in the prostate and will follow up later with five weeks of external radiation. Although neither the mayor nor his doctors have elaborated on the reasons for this course of treatment, it is almost certainly designed to give him the best balanced outcome between curing the cancer and avoiding the debilitating side effects -- incontinence and impotence -- that can make the treatment seem almost as bad as the disease.</p>
        <p>The frustrating truth, as Mayor Giuliani's case has so publicly illustrated, is that advances in diagnostic testing have forced patients and their doctors to make choices on treatments before evidence has solidified to indicate which approach works best and under what circumstances. The so-called Prostate Specific Antigen, or P.S.A., tests can detect the presence of tumors at a very early stage, so early that doctors cannot be sure that the typically slow-growing cancers would even reach a lethal stage before the patient dies of something else.</p>
        <p>Sometimes patients opt for ''watchful waiting'' or close monitoring to see how the cancer will progress before making a fateful choice. But once people know they have a tumor inside them, the urge to take aggressive action is usually irresistible.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, no one has completed the head-to-head clinical trials that would help patients decide which treatment is best, leaving patients to rely on advice from specialists in surgery or radiation who generally recommend their own specialty. The mayor started with hormone therapy to shrink the tumor, and then had 90 rice-grain-sized radiation seeds implanted yesterday. Two months from now he will start external radiation five days a week for five weeks, and will continue hormone therapy as well.</p>
        <p>In choosing this course of treatment, the mayor, whose own father died of prostate cancer years ago, presumably balanced his desire to be cured of the disease against risk and lifestyle considerations. It is the kind of choice that has bedeviled thousands of other men and will continue to perplex them until medical science can determine what prostate cancer treatments work best, and on whom.</p>
