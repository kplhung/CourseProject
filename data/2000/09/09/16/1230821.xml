        <p>Re ''There They Go, Bad-Mouthing Divorce Again,'' by Jane Smiley (Op-Ed, Sept. 12):</p>
        <p>At age 18, I may not have much experience when it comes to marriage and divorce. However, my parents split up a decade ago, and I think it was neither a good nor a bad occurrence. It has had its negatives and its positives. But I learned one thing from it: Happiness is not quite as important as love.</p>
        <p>Yet Ms. Smiley does not mention love once. How can one talk about marriage without speaking at all of love? I am sure that happiness, compatibility and peace are very important in a marriage, but what happened to the notion that people marry for love? I hope that with the prominence of divorce, love has not been misplaced.</p>
