        <p>Javier Vazquez was the equalizer tonight, the hot starting pitcher who could lift an also-ran over a contender for a night in September. The Mets accepted that part of their 4-3 loss to the Montreal Expos.</p>
        <p>''I think he's going to be a 20-game winner someday in this league,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said of Vazquez, who had shut out the Atlanta Braves in his previous start.</p>
        <p>''It was just him,'' said third baseman Robin Ventura, who struck out in all three at-bats. ''He just threw a good game. That happens.''</p>
        <p>The Mets had gotten a lead in the fourth inning on a two-out, bases-empty home run by Mike Piazza. But that was a mirage, for the team and the player. Piazza was hitless in his other three at-bats, all with runners on base, and Mets pitchers served up a rash of careless pitches to harmless hitters.</p>
        <p>Al Leiter, who did not last through the sixth, was aware that Vazquez is a decent hitter for a pitcher, with a .228 average. But Leiter was disgusted to have given up two important hits to his counterpart, including one that began the Expos' winning rally in the sixth.</p>
        <p>''The pitcher had no business beating me with his bat,'' Leiter said. ''He gets a two-out hit, a run scores, it's pathetic. He's over .200, but whatever. He's a pitcher.''</p>
        <p>As Turk Wendell discovered, being broken by a light-hitting shortstop is no better. After Vazquez singled with two outs in the sixth, which Leiter expected to be his final inning, Peter Bergeron flicked an opposite-field double into the left-field corner. Wendell came in from the bullpen, and Orlando Cabrera took a hanging slider into the left-field corner, just over the wall for a two-run homer that gave the Expos their 4-3 lead.</p>
        <p>The home-run pitch was a slider, and Wendell said he had made mistakes with the pitch to Mark McGwire and had not been beaten. But it stung to lose a duel with Cabrera, who is 5 feet 10, 175 pounds and has a .239 average.</p>
        <p>''You shouldn't let a guy like that beat you; that's what's disheartening the most,'' said Wendell, who later added, ''He's a pesky little shortstop. It's not like he's some home run hitter like A-Rod. You can live with getting beat by one of their power hitters -- not a guy that's got eight or 10 home runs.''</p>
        <p>Piazza's homer was his 35th and just his second in September. It snapped an 0-for-17 slide, coming off a curveball and clearing the fence in left-center field.</p>
        <p>But Piazza had already popped up in the first, when a sacrifice fly was needed. That was a good swing, he said, and Valentine initially thought the ball was crushed.</p>
        <p>But his sixth-inning hit was a grounder, for a double play, and then he came up with two outs and a runner on first in the eighth. Facing Vazquez, Piazza fouled a high fastball straight back to fall behind in the count, 0-2.</p>
        <p>That may have been the best pitch to hit, and Piazza had just missed it. He popped to second, ending the inning and the Mets' last threat.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully it's a little kick in the right direction, great,'' Piazza said of the home run. ''I still had a couple of bad swings as well. I'm not completely back where I want to be, but it's a start.''</p>
        <p>Vazquez (10-7) left after getting Piazza in the eighth, and Scott Strickland pitched a scoreless ninth for the save.</p>
        <p>Sandwiched around Piazza's homer were two rallies starring Darryl Hamilton, whose playing time has been scaled back lately.</p>
        <p>Hamilton, who went 2 for 4, led off the game with a single, and when Derek Bell doubled to the warning track in left-center, Hamilton sped around the bases, scoring without a throw.</p>
        <p>He showed no signs of a limp then, though he ran with more pain as the game went on.</p>
        <p>Vazquez settled in after Bell's double, retiring the next 10 hitters before Piazza's home run.</p>
        <p>In the fifth, Jay Payton lined a single to center and Kurt Abbott grounded one to left. After Leiter struck out on a bunt attempt, Hamilton singled to center, scoring Payton and giving the Mets a 3-1 lead.</p>
        <p>Vazquez had an impressive sixth inning, retiring Piazza on a double-play groundout and fanning Ventura for the third time. He still trailed, 4-3, but not for long.</p>
        <p>Leiter got two outs in the sixth and had to retire Vazquez.</p>
        <p>There seemed to be a good chance this would be his last inning; Leiter had thrown a season-high 135 pitches in his last start and was not conserving them tonight.</p>
        <p>But Vazquez grounded a ball up the middle, and a grass field might have slowed it enough for the second baseman, Alfonzo, to make a play.</p>
        <p>But it scooted through on the turf, and after Leiter watched it unfold, he yanked the bill of his cap, pulling it down toward his eyes. There was more work to be done, and he could not do it, turning things over to Wendell after Bergeron's double.</p>
        <p>One positive to come from the Mets' early-September slide, Valentine said, was that they did not abuse the bullpen during it. ''Everybody got their tank filled, I think,'' Valentine said. Wendell, who thrives on regular work, had not pitched since he lost last Saturday to the Phillies.</p>
        <p>But despite losing tonight's game, too, Wendell (7-6) said he was happy to be rested. The Mets still have a comfortable lead for the National League wild card, and even on a bad night, they can think hopefully of what lies ahead.</p>
        <p>''With our bullpen and the way we're used a lot, it's not characteristic that we do get a break,'' Wendell said. ''But I think I'll definitely be better for the playoffs, and deep into the playoffs, being that I did get a five-day rest.''</p>
