        <p>Get out the shovel, the backhoe, or whatever tool is necessary and clear some space in your house or apartment. It's almost time to bring in the delicate specimens.</p>
        <p>Most plants, even those that grow best in partial shade outside, need a south-facing situation once they come indoors. If you are like me, and went overboard on regal geraniums or lantana in the summer, you know that they will not all fit on one narrow windowsill. If you want to keep the plants, invest in windowsill extenders (if your windows will accommodate them), or some plant lights.</p>

        <p>Clear a space in the cellar or some other cool dry place for the corms and tubers of plants such as begonia and caladium.  Let them dry out for a few days before storing them in labeled containers.</p>
