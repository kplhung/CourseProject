        <p>Pushed by an angry judge and prodded by a state labor mediator, Buffalo's striking teachers went back to class yesterday and promised to remain on the job until Tuesday, when a mediator is expected to propose a settlement.</p>
        <p>Although the mediator's intervention appeared to help get the teachers back to work, Buffalo school officials objected that the state had intruded without their knowledge or consent and had derailed negotiations that had been progressing.</p>
        <p>Strikes by teachers are illegal under New York law. But Buffalo's teachers have struck twice, on Sept. 7 and again on Thursday.</p>
        <p>On Thursday evening, the State Public Employees Relations Board took Buffalo school officials by surprise by announcing that the 3,800 teachers would go back to work pending a report that would be issued by the mediator on Tuesday and presented by the state board. Paul G. Buchanan, president of the Buffalo Board of Education, said the mediator's announcement disrupted negotiations.</p>
        <p>''There was a sense that we were getting closer, that we were going to define the gaps,'' Mr. Buchanan said.  ''But then like Monty Python, the PERB jumps in and says, 'And now for something completely different.' They've been with us for 10 months and two strikes and now they're going to assert their authority?''</p>
        <p>Philip Rumore, president of the Buffalo Teachers Federation, denied yesterday that negotiations had been making progress and said instead that school negotiators had reneged on verbal agreements made earlier, which school officials deny. Mr. Rumore said the union was glad to have the mediator join the argument. ''We're willing to try this, so we've agreed to have the teachers go in until Tuesday.''</p>
        <p>Last Tuesday, Justice Kevin M. Dillon of State Supreme Court issued a restraining order against the striking teachers and criticized the union leaders by name for what he said was a damaging strike against the interests of children in New York's second-largest school district.</p>
        <p>Buffalo is not the only region in the Northeast facing a teacher strike. Teachers in Hamilton Township, N.J., went into their second weekend on strike over pay, in defiance of a back-to-work order from Judge Anthony J. Parrillo of Superior Court.</p>
        <p>Judge Parrillo, who on Monday imposed fines of $100,000 a day on the local teachers union and $300 a day on each teacher, ordered the two sides into round-the-clock weekend bargaining yesterday and repeated his order that the teachers be in school Monday morning or face still harsher penalties. He ordered lawyers for the school board and for the teachers back in court on Monday.</p>
        <p>''We are thankful that the judge has given us the weekend to try to end this situation,'' Karen Joseph, the spokeswoman for the New Jersey Education Association, the statewide union, said in a voice hoarse with exhaustion. Negotiations resumed at 4 p.m. yesterday.</p>
