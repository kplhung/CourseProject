        <p>Despite the cool, windy conditions here that sprinters do not generally like, Marion Jones said today that she believed she could significantly lower her personal best in the 100 meters in winning a gold medal next week at the Olympics.</p>
        <p>Asked if she thought she could be beaten in next Saturday's 100 final, Jones said: ''I know if I put together the race that is possible, it will be quite difficult. I'm not sitting here saying I'm Superwoman or that I'm invincible. But I'm at the top of my game, I'm confident, I'm at the Olympic Games. If someone is ready to run 10.6 or 10.5, let's make it a race.''</p>

        <p>Despite the cool, windy conditions here that sprinters do not generally like, Marion Jones said today that she believed she could significantly lower her personal best in the 100 meters in winning a gold medal next week at the Olympics.</p>
        <p>Asked if she thought she could be beaten in next Saturday's 100 final, Jones said: ''I know if I put together the race that is possible, it will be quite difficult. I'm not sitting here saying I'm Superwoman or that I'm invincible. But I'm at the top of my game, I'm confident, I'm at the Olympic Games. If someone is ready to run 10.6 or 10.5, let's make it a race.''</p>
        <p>Her personal best is 10.65 seconds, run two years ago in Johannesburg, South Africa. The only three faster times in history belong to Florence Griffith Joyner -- 10.49, 10.61, 10.62 -- all run in 1988. Jones ran a wind-aided 10.68 several weeks ago in Stockholm, Sweden, and said she believed she would be faster here.</p>
        <p>''I'm in the best shape of my life,'' Jones said at a news conference. ''Regardless of the rumors about the wind and temperature, when I step on the track for the 100 and 200, wonderful things are going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Jones is attempting to become the first female track-and-field athlete to win five gold medals in one Olympics. She will compete in the 100, 200, long jump, 4x100-meter relay and the 4x400-meter relay. She will consider wearing a bodysuit if the temperatures drop too severely, she said, but otherwise she did not believe the weather would be a hindrance.</p>
        <p>''It's taken 20 years of my life to get here,'' Jones said. ''I'm not concerned what Mother Nature does.''</p>
        <p>Criticism of her record attempt has come from the unlikeliest of places -- Carl Lewis, who won four gold medals at the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles and who is considered by many the greatest track-and-field athlete of all time. Lewis told The Associated Press that he thought it was ''unfair that her camp put her in this situation to run two relays.''</p>
        <p>Trevor Graham, who coaches Jones, said of Lewis, ''That's his problem.''</p>
        <p>''It's funny,'' said Jones, who grew up with Lewis as one of her idols. ''I'm going to have my critics and have people say I can't do that.'' Pointing to her heart, she said: ''It's what I believe right here. This is what I want to do, what I think I can achieve. Unfortunately, some people are going to try to bring you down. I can't focus on that. Nothing nobody says is going to deter me from going after this five, regardless of who it is.''</p>
        <p>Unlike Lewis who won four gold medals in the long jump, Jones has struggled mightily in the event. Last month, facing the top Olympic contenders, she finished fifth at a meet in Brussels. The problem is a matter of controlling her sprinter's speed on the runway in the long jump and avoiding fouls, Graham said.</p>
        <p>In Brussels, Jones had a couple of jumps that appeared to be 24 feet, but she went beyond the takeoff board, he said. A 24-foot jump here should easily win the Olympics.</p>
        <p>''If I get on the board, my speed without a doubt is there,'' Jones said. ''I'm hearing all it takes is one big jump and the competition can be over. That's what I'm hoping.''</p>
        <p>One thing in her favor here, she said, is that she will not have any rounds of the 100 and rounds of the long jump on the same day.</p>
        <p>''I found it difficult the past couple years after running the 100 and adjusting my speed in the long jump,'' Jones said. ''I can't run 10.69 on the runway. I need to be a lot more relaxed and comfortable on the runway. I won't have to worry about transferring speed here. I think that's a plus.''</p>
