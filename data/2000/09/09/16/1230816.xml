        <p>The second world Internet Championship is approaching its conclusion, with eight teams still in contention.</p>
        <p>In the Western Hemisphere, the defending champions are headed by Doug Simson and include three world champions: Jeff Meckstroth, Eric Rodwell and Paul Soloway. They face a team that includes a father-and-son combination, Richard Pavlicek and Richard Pavlicek Jr. In another match, a cosmopolitan Florida team that includes Benito Garozzo, winner of many titles for Italy, faces Argentina.</p>
        <p>In the rest of the world division, Ireland plays China and Romania faces Sweden. The winners of the two hemisphere contests will meet in November at the start of the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals in Birmingham, Ala. The two losing hemispheric finalists will play off for third place.</p>
        <p>The Argentine team, which trails Florida by 16 imps at the midpoint of its match, includes the youngest player of world class anywhere. He is 13-year-old Agustin Madala, who has already won several national titles.</p>
        <p>When he was 12, his partner was Carlos Cabanne, Argentina's veteran star, who was 70 years older than he was. In a field that included some world titlists, they finished second in the South American Pairs Championship, setting a record for age differential in a successful partnership.</p>
        <p>Madala is in high school, and is forbidden to play on the OKBridge network on weekday evenings. However, his computer sometimes becomes busy after his mother is asleep.</p>
        <p>One of his best playing efforts was as South on the diagramed deal. He was doubled in three hearts after his partner had made a take-out double of a one-spade opening. It would seem that he was due to lose three trump tricks and two black aces.</p>
        <p>East won his partner's opening spade lead with the ace and continued the suit. South won with the king, throwing a club from the dummy. He then led a heart to queen, which was taken by the ace. East should have persevered with spades, but he led a club in the belief that he could score his partner's club ace and later take two trump tricks.</p>
        <p>West took his ace and led a low spade. This gave South a chance to score the spade ten, but that did not suit him.</p>
        <p>He ruffed in dummy, crossed to the club jack and took a winning diamond finesse. He cashed the diamond ace, ruffed a diamond, and returned to dummy with a club lead to the king. The position was now this:</p>
        <p>ILL: Diagram</p>
        <p>When the diamond seven was led, East had to ruff. Madala discarded his spade ten, and had made his doubled contract with brilliant play.</p>
        <p>East was left to realize that it was his own fault that his three sure trump tricks had shrunk to two.</p>
