        <p>Pleasantly surprising investors, Volkswagen A.G. said it would repurchase up to 10 percent of its shares, one of the biggest buybacks ever planned in Germany. The move, which helped push VW shares 4.3 percent higher, to 49 euros, or $42.14, on the Frankfurt exchange, is a departure for Volkswagen, which has in the past shown little interest in strengthening the price of its shares. Company executives said they hoped to use the shares they reacquire as a currency to make other acquisitions. Volkswagen has long wanted to expand its trucking operations, and already owns 18 percent of the shares in Scania A.B. of Sweden. Volkswagen has also made overtures to BMW A.G., the Bavarian car manufacturer, but BMW's controlling shareholder -- the Quandt family -- has rejected all approaches.</p>
