        <p>Olympic athletes have been role models since the days of the ancient Greeks, representing the best that is physically achievable.

        <p>But there's a wrinkle in the scheme now, and it gets bigger every time the Olympic Games roll around. We used to pluck athletes out of the fields of Arcadia, just as dewy and fresh as natural apples, but this is an era when our apples may be genetically modified.</p>

        <p>Olympic athletes have been role models since the days of the ancient Greeks, representing the best that is physically achievable. Comely, brave young men, the champions of their city-states, would hurl their javelins down a playing field, instead of at one another. The winners were crowned with laurel and carried on the shoulders of an adoring populace, and all was as it should be.</p>
        <p>But there's a wrinkle in the scheme now, and it gets bigger every time the Olympic Games roll around. We used to pluck athletes out of the fields of Arcadia, just as dewy and fresh as natural apples, but this is an era when our apples may be genetically modified.</p>
        <p>We're achieving levels of performance far beyond those of the ancient Greeks and rather beyond the merely human. Growth hormone and blood-doping scandals have broken out repeatedly, but this is just the thin edge of the biomedical wedge.</p>
        <p>If you want a human body to work to unhuman levels, you have to understand it fully. You have to measure and record everything, from the protein level to the gross mechanics of bones and tendons. Then, once you fully grasp the science of sports medicine, you can re-engineer that body, not with mere crude narcotics, but with the body's own software and hardware. Every four years is a further measure of this progress.</p>
        <p>Not that we'll want to line people's bones with titanium so that they clank like Robocop or look like the pop-culture symbols of the posthuman, from Star Trek Borgs to the X-Men. There's no market pull for monsters. But men and women everywhere have always wanted to look and act just like athletes. Or like supermodels. Or best of all, like a combo athlete/supermodel, like, say, Gabrielle Reece. The path to athletic beauty is the one we will follow forward to the more than human.</p>
        <p>The masters of the Olympics are anxiously policing the easy stuff. They properly see growth hormone as the international sports equivalent of cheating on arms accords. But the body is subtle, the range of performance is very wide, and there are many clever workarounds. Knowledge is power. If knowledge of the body explodes, then banning drugs is a mere finger in the dike.</p>
        <p>Suppose you need bigger biceps. You have your arms scanned after every workout with a nuclear magnetic resonator, examining every working strand of muscle by computer. In this case, the athlete has done nothing illegal. But while his rival in Kenya trains the traditional way, building strength with push-ups, our cyber-paragon can tailor a program to his exact needs for more-than-peak performance -- while obeying the letter of the Olympic law.</p>
        <p>The two competitors look and weigh the same, they both test drug-free, but the champ knows himself on a cellular level, while others still work by pre-industrial intuition. We like to think that Rocky will win this one by sheer guts and heart. That's sports mythology at its best.</p>
        <p>The trend toward the future of the body manifests itself best now in non-Olympic sports -- poorly policed, wondrous spectacles where we're cutting to the chase because the refs are all in on the action.</p>
        <p>TV wrestling, for example, features big, steam-snorting guys who emphasize their sci-fi departure from the human norm with pancake makeup, klieg lights and tattoos. Modern female bodybuilders look like no women have ever looked in human history.  Even genuinely tough, scary, ferocious women -- say, the mothers and sisters of invading hordes -- would keen in alarm at the sight of these women.</p>
        <p>Yet we moderns don't find their strength offputting, because this is the exact direction in which we ourselves long to go. Compare any contemporary model to the zaftig beach babes of the 1940's. The modern ones are very lean and strong, with backs ridged with muscle and legs fit to kick holes in sheetrock.</p>
        <p>This is the catwalk to the posthuman future. Olympic athletes are just fighting our battles first, mocking it up in a cleansing social ritual. If they try to slow down, an eager society will just take a route around them. They may remain honest to their oldest traditions -- but if they do, they risk becoming sentimental antiques.</p>
