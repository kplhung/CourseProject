        <p>A door in the General Motors Corporation's South Korea headquarters in Seoul says it all: GM Korea Marketing War Room.</p>
        <p>For decades, foreign car companies have been seeking to gain a toehold in South Korea's market, now the second largest in Asia after Japan. And for just as long, the Korean government, eager to protect the country's car industry, has managed to repulse the invaders, using everything from blatant trade barriers to more subtle maneuvers to keep foreign encroachment at bay.</p>
        <p>So successful were its efforts that even today, South Korea has far fewer foreign cars on its roads than any other country.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, even with Ford Motor's withdrawal, other foreign carmakers like G.M., Fiat, Renault and DaimlerChrysler remain intently interested in South Korea's carmaking industry.</p>
        <p>G.M. and Fiat indicated yesterday that they might revive an earlier bid for Daewoo. On Sept. 1, Renault completed the purchase of the Samsung Motors Company, and on Sept. 6 the Hyundai Motor Company, South Korea's largest automaker, approved the sale of a 9 percent stake to DaimlerChrysler.</p>
        <p>South Korea has opened many sectors of its economy in the wake of the financial crisis almost three years ago. Foreign investment in the country has jumped from $1 billion in 1992 to an expected $20 billion this year, according to Industrial Research Consulting Ltd., a research and advisory firm in Seoul that helps foreign companies develop business in Korea.</p>
        <p>Its car companies, however, have long managed to escape outside influence of any kind. In Korea, like other parts of the world, the auto industry is freighted with emotion. Making cars represents a country's national aspirations, economic prowess and its prosperity in a way that brewers, insurers, chip makers and chemical companies do not.</p>
        <p>That is what makes the foreign  ownership stakes in South Korean carmakers so striking.</p>
        <p>David Jerome, head of GM Korea, said such sales represent ''a bit of a test of South Korea's resolve to reform corporate governance and financial management.''</p>
        <p>South Korea's new willingness to seek foreign buyers for its carmakers contrasts starkly with its attitude in previous years. In 1988, Ford was thwarted in a bid to buy the bankrupt Kia Motors, losing out to Hyundai Motors in what was seen by some as a demonstration of the government's inability to bring the country's powerful business groups to heel. And when it became clear that Samsung's operations could not survive independently, the government first tried to engineer a takeover by Daewoo rather than soliciting bids from outsiders.</p>
        <p>But now, some say, there is a growing recognition -- even among ordinary Koreans -- that the nation must change its insular ways if it wants to secure a place in a world that is increasingly oblivious to national borders.</p>
        <p>''I guess nowadays if you want to survive on this earth, you can no longer only sell things made in your own country,'' said Park Kwang Sa, 60, a cab driver. ''Koreans will face a very difficult time if we keep discriminating against foreign cars.''</p>
        <p>Even with the foreign carmaking presence in South Korea, there is no expectation that foreign cars will flood the streets of Seoul and other South Korean cities.</p>
        <p>''Economic necessity has forced a change on the part of the government and companies,'' Mr. Jerome of G.M. said. ''But it takes a bit longer to change attitudes.''</p>
        <p>What has really provoked foreign automaker interest in South Korea are the benefits of manufacturing in the country, which boasts lower labor costs and better efficiency than many other places where cars are made. They will also gain access to established distribution and service networks that may eventually be used to support the sales of their other brands.</p>
        <p>''They're blurring the distinction between domestic and imported vehicles,'' Peter A. Underwood, a principal at Industrial Research Consulting, said in a recent interview in Seoul. ''That's important because a lot of the obstacles to selling foreign cars here are in people's minds.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jerome said foreign carmakers could capture as much as 10 percent of the market and sell roughly 100,000 cars a year in Korea -- if the investments prove fruitful and are accompanied by further market liberalization.</p>
        <p>South Korea has long been one of the toughest auto markets for foreigners to crack. Foreign cars account for a minuscule 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent of the market, the lowest penetration in the world. Hyundai Motors and its subsidiary Kia enjoy a 75 percent market share.</p>
        <p>Until 1986, foreign cars were banned from South Korea. Japanese models were forbidden until July of last year; memories of Japan's 35-year colonial rule still run deep.</p>
        <p>Since the ban was lifted, though, other barriers have worked almost as effectively. Importers were forced to follow unusually stringent testing procedures, and the government demanded that foreign carmakers establish extensive, nationwide service networks as a condition of doing business here.</p>
        <p>Buyers of foreign cars have also suffered. For years, the government conducted tax audits of individuals who purchased foreign cars, and for a period during the economic crisis, the police reported that women driving BMW's were often victims of crimes.</p>
        <p>''During the financial crisis, the only people who drove foreign cars were people who were getting rich off the high interest rates that were charged then, and that made me really angry,'' said Kim Jeun Sung, a 48-year-old office worker.</p>
        <p>While domestic auto companies have traditionally enjoyed favorable public support around the world, nationalistic attitudes toward the auto industry run far deeper in Korea than elsewhere. Not long ago, it was common for the media to take pictures of people getting into their imported cars, or even standing in a foreign car showroom, and talk about traitors.</p>
        <p>''Cars are a pretty exposed consumer good,'' Mr. Underwood said. ''You can stick a Gucci watch in your pocket if you're afraid of offending someone, or claim your Rolex is a fake, but your car is harder to hide.''</p>
        <p>But rather than trying to market their own brands, foreign carmakers that invest in South Korea are banking on selling more cars with Samsung and Daewoo hood ornaments -- more in keeping with the theory that if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.</p>
        <p>Indeed, what is going on in Korea is not so much that the country is opening up willingly to foreign investment as that the worldwide auto industry, awash in capacity and facing spiraling costs of research and development, is consolidating into fewer and fewer major companies.</p>
        <p>Government officials here bristle at the suggestion they have not yet wholly confirmed their commitment to open trade. They note that tariffs on passenger cars imported into Korea are lower than comparable European Union tariffs and that the government itself is buying a few more foreign cars.</p>
        <p>Until now, only the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Blue House, the South Korean equivalent of the White House, used foreign cars. ''Our government decided that if some ministries use foreign cars as their official cars or for accommodating foreign guests, the perception problems will diminish,'' said Han Duck Soo, Korea's Minister of Trade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Han is nonetheless rather pessimistic about whether the purchase of a new Saab for his official use will make much difference. ''We hope it may have some impact,'' he said. ''But I have realized since we bought this car that there is a big competitive problem as well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Han and the Korean automakers contend that foreign imports are simply too big and too expensive.</p>
        <p>''There is no discrimination or barriers to entry at all at the moment,'' said Lee Dong Wha, the executive director of the Korean Auto Manufacturers Association. ''The major reason for such poor sales of foreign cars in Korea is a lack of effort and marketing strategies by the importers.''</p>
        <p>Foreign manufacturers say that after shipping costs, testing and other charges, they cannot make a profit importing the smaller, less expensive cars that form the core of the market in Korea. Indeed, even Korean manufacturers have a hard time eking a profit out of small cars, making at most, analysts say, about $600 on every car sold.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Lee's insistence that all import barriers have fallen, discrimination against foreign cars persists. This year, the foreign manufacturers held their own motor show, spending more than $2 million an exhibit. They said they were tired of paying higher fees to take part in the show sponsored by the Korean manufacturers' association and then being assigned unsuitable floor space.</p>
        <p>The auto show has been a point of contention since 1995, the first year it was held. At first, the Korean car companies simply did not invite their foreign competitors to participate. Foreign car companies protested; eventually, the domestics relented. But by that time, Mr. Lee said, the space was all taken, so the foreigners were assigned to a separate building.</p>
        <p>The association promised that in the second show, in 1997, foreign and domestic models would be shown together. It kept that promise, but charged foreign car makers much higher fees and demanded that they pay in dollars, Mr. Lee said.</p>
        <p>''We had our third motor show last year, and we offered foreign manufacturers the same participation fee, to be paid in Korean won, and also promised to give them fair consideration for locations inside the exhibition space,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the foreigners boycotted the show, contending that they were notified of the schedule and terms so late that they could not take part. And they have no plans to participate in the fourth Seoul Motor Show next year, either. Mr. Jerome said it was logistically impossible and prohibitively expensive to mount exhibits two consecutive years, and right now, the foreign car companies are planning to repeat a separate show in 2002.</p>
        <p>The separate show, however, did not solve the problems; it may even have added to them. In midshow, the Ministry of Finance and Economy announced that Koreans must report to the authorities the purchase of any car with an engine displacement higher than 3,000 cc's -- or basically any foreign car sold in Korea and a few high-end domestic models.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, foreign car manufacturers were flooded with cancellations of orders, and owners of foreign cars began dumping them. ''I think the problem was that our motor show had more people coming through than the domestic auto show, and that upset some people in the industry,'' Mr. Jerome said.</p>
        <p>The Korean government rescinded the reporting requirement after an enormous amount of pressure was brought to bear by foreign governments, but the contracts had long since been canceled. ''It's breaking down those attitudes that is the hardest part of what we're dealing with here,'' Mr. Jerome said. ''The mid-level bureaucrat who came up with that policy still has his job.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 19, 2000, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Saturday about the interest shown by foreign companies in the Korean automobile industry omitted details about a decision by the Ford Motor Company. On Friday, Ford withdrew its $6.9 billion bid to buy the Daewoo Motor Company of South Korea. A related article appears today on Page C4.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 21, 2000, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Saturday about interest shown by foreign automakers in South Korea's automotive industry misstated the year the Ford Motor Company sought to buy Kia Motors. It was 1998, not 1988. Also because of an editing error, the article misstated the site of an interview with Peter A. Underwood, a consultant who advises foreign companies about doing business in South Korea. He was reached in Seoul by telephone from Tokyo, not interviewed in Seoul.</p>
