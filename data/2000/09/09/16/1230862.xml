        <p>The suicide bomber's head, with its neatly barbered and combed black hair, lay today in the middle of a busy thoroughfare in this capital city, a grisly warning from separatist Tamil rebels at a time when campaigning for Oct. 10 parliamentary elections has gone into full swing.</p>
        <p>In past election years, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, on a drawn-out military crusade for a separate Tamil nation, have often dispatched suicide bombers known as Black Tigers to kill political leaders, with the aim of disrupting the democratic process and killing enemies and rivals. They have often succeeded.</p>
        <p>But today's bomber apparently detonated himself prematurely when a policeman approached him, before his real target materialized. He had been loitering in front of the city's Eye Hospital, next to the bustling medical complex of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, he managed to kill the policeman and five other people, hospital and police officials said. Among his victims were taxi drivers and hospital workers.</p>
        <p>''This suicide cadre had been outside the main gate for some time and the people here suspected him,'' said A. R. Edirisinghe, the officer in charge at the local police station, who was interviewed at the scene of the bombing. ''The police officer may have approached him. At that time, the suicide cadre exploded himself.''</p>
        <p>It was not known who was the target, though it may have been the Health Minister, who works yards from the Eye Hospital and is also running for a seat in Parliament.</p>
        <p>The Tigers did not take responsibility for this suicide bombing. Nor have they claimed or denied responsibility for other such attacks. But suicide bombings are their signature, and the police and the public here presume the Tigers are behind them. The Tigers are now fighting the Sri Lankan military for control of the northern Jaffna peninsula, which they believe should be part of a new Tamil nation.</p>
        <p>Jayantha Ratnayake stood around the corner from the bombing. The attacks do not deter him from going to work as a marketing manager in a construction firm or following his normal routine. He is typical.</p>
        <p>The city barely paused at the news of another bombing today. Tourists from Europe frolicked in the swimming pools of five-star hotels, business executives filled silvery skyscrapers and the streets were jammed with traffic, as usual.</p>
        <p>''We are getting used to this, even small children,'' Mr. Ratnayake said. ''The bomb is part and parcel of our lives. We have to live with it.''</p>
