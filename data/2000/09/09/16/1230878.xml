        <p>For the first time in more than 14 years, it cost American consumers a bit less last month to fill their market baskets with goods and services than it did the month before.</p>
        <p>It took an exceptionally big drop in energy prices to bring about this rare suspension of inflation -- and economists agreed that the trend would almost certainly be fleeting since the price of oil has climbed in September to a 10-year peak.</p>
        <p>In fact, analysts said they found further evidence in yesterday's Labor Department report that inflation was edging up, though not at a pace that should worry policy makers just yet.</p>
        <p>''There is an upward creep in some areas, particularly services,'' said Richard B. Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''But the Federal Reserve ought to still be pretty comfortable.''</p>
        <p>The central bank raised short-term interest rates six times between mid-1999 and this past May to prevent unsustainably fast economic growth from stoking inflation, but the Fed has since taken no further action as the economy shows more and more signs of slowing.</p>
        <p>Most analysts now assume that the Fed, which would prefer not to raise rates during the election season, will remain on the sidelines at least through the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The Consumer Price Index for August inched down 0.1 percent as the cost of energy skidded 2.9 percent. Gasoline itself dropped 6 percent, the most since February 1991 in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war, but has rebounded this month.</p>
        <p>The last time the C.P.I. declined was also tied to energy. In 1986, world oil prices collapsed, bringing down overall inflation.</p>
        <p>When the energy and food components, which tend to swing widely, are excluded, the index advanced 0.2 percent, the fifth consecutive month at this same, steady pace.</p>
        <p>''The core is still moderate,'' said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities, suggesting no urgency for additional Fed action but pointing to its 2.5 percent rise over the last 12 months compared with 1.9 percent for calendar 1999.</p>
        <p>''That's not a huge deterioration, but it is a deterioration,'' Mr. Rippe said. ''And if energy price rises begin to be passed along, that would become a troublesome situation.''</p>
        <p>The upward pressure is coming largely from services, like medical care. Medical services have climbed from an annual rate of 3.3 percent for the three months ended November 1999 to 5.2 percent for June through August.</p>
        <p>Inflation for all nonenergy services ran at 3.8 percent for the latest three months, compared with 3.1 percent six months earlier.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the core rate of inflation, measuring prices for goods other than food and energy, fell at a 1.1 percent annual pace in the June-through-August period.</p>
        <p>In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said that the output of the nation's factories, mines and utilities climbed 0.3 percent last month, a rise owing much to unusually hot weather that pushed up demand for electricity and forced utilities to operate at 91.2 percent of capacity, almost four percentage points above average.</p>
        <p>Factory production this summer, however, slackened to the slowest two-month pace since early 1999.</p>
        <p>Although energy dominated the August price results, the report showed that the cost of shelter, which accounts for 30 percent of the index, rose 0.3 percent after a 0.2 percent July increase. Over the last 12 months, shelter has risen 3.2 percent.</p>
        <p>But prices in the food and beverage category, with a 16 percent index weight, slowed their rise to 0.2 percent from 0.5 percent as each of the major food-at-home groups other than fruits and vegetables contributed to the deceleration.</p>
        <p>The medical category climbed 0.4  percent to a level that was 4.2 percent higher than in August 1999, with hospital and related services up 6.6 percent over the year. The cost of prescription drugs jumped 0.6 percent, the biggest monthly rise since November.</p>
        <p>As for the largest metropolitan areas, prices in New York rose 0.2 percent last month and have gone up 3 percent since August 1999; Los Angeles was up 0.3 percent and 3.5 percent over the year, while prices in Chicago fell 0.5 percent last month to a level that was 2.5 percent above that of August 1999.</p>
        <p>The report also showed that inflation had eroded the purchasing power of the 1982-1984 dollar to 57.9 cents and the 1967 dollar to 19.3 cents.</p>
