        <p>There was the housing tier that the inmates called the terror dome, because correction officers meted out particularly brutal discipline there.</p>
        <p>There were the elevator rides that troublesome inmates took: a prisoner, handcuffed to an inner railing, would be beaten senseless by a half-dozen guards as the car ascended and descended.</p>
        <p>There was the medical wing, staffed not by physicians, but by guards, who acted as doctors and dispensed psychiatric medicines.</p>
        <p>These and many more facets of life in the Nassau County jail were detailed in a scathing 23-page report released to county officials after a 14-month federal investigation.</p>
        <p>The investigation, by the Department of Justice, was provoked by the death of an inmate who was bludgeoned by correction officers on Jan. 8, 1999, because he would not stop begging for methadone.</p>
        <p>The report, dated Sept. 11, was delivered to the Nassau County executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, and the county sheriff, Edward Reilly. It said that jail officials failed to discipline their staff, failed to investigate inmates' allegations of abuse, provided little and sometimes no training to correction officers before putting them to work, were indifferent to inmates' medical needs and failed to keep track of officers who were consistently accused of brutality.</p>
        <p>The contents of the study, first reported today in Newsday, included findings that, in some cases, correction officers paid inmates, with cigarettes, food and other treats, to beat up other prisoners -- usually sex offenders. Inmates referred to some correctional crews as ''goon squads'' and ''beat-up crews,'' the report said, and in one case, it said, an officer told an inmate, ''Hope you enjoy your stay, rapist,'' and doused him with a fire extinguisher.</p>
        <p>The 1,600-bed jail has ''an institutional culture that supports and promotes abuse,'' said the report, which was signed by Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and Bill Lann Lee, the assistant United States attorney general for civil rights. ''We find that the various explanations offered by jail administrators for their failure to discipline staff for using excessive force are pretexts for inaction,'' they wrote.</p>
        <p>Sheriff Reilly said today that many of the recommendations made by the government had been put into effect, but he offered no specifics. ''At this juncture, it would be premature and inappropriate to comment on the report in detail,'' the sheriff wrote in a faxed statement. ''However, I can say that a number of items referred to in the report, derived from the on-site inspection over a year ago, have been addressed.''</p>
        <p>The report laid out six pages of minimum recommendations that the county must meet by Oct. 30 or face federal sanctions. Among those recommendations are: providing all correctional workers with training before they assume their posts; creating a meaningful system of reporting and tracking the use of force; and restructuring the internal affairs unit as an independent oversight board.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the report said, the county must increase access to health and dental care, provide doctors and nurses for this purpose, and train officers to deal with inmates with special needs, including women, the mentally ill and those infected with H.I.V.</p>
        <p>''The report corroborates our worst fears about what was happening behind those walls,'' said Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association, a nonprofit watchdog group. ''Unfortunately, what happened in Nassau County is not that rare. Unless there is a strong sheriff or outside agency, the worst inclinations of that staff often take over and go unaccounted or unpunished.''</p>
        <p>While the federal authorities will have the right to sue the county after Oct. 30, they have expressed an interest in working with the county to avoid litigation. ''We hope to address the concerns laid out in the report,'' said Sanford Cohen, chief of the civil rights litigation section of the United States attorney's office, who supervised the investigation. Mr. Cohen successfully prosecuted five correction officers in connection with the beating death of the heroin addict, Thomas Pizzuto.</p>
        <p>Changes have taken place at the jail since Mr. Pizzuto's death, county officials said. Former Sheriff Joseph Jablonski retired last year under pressure from state and federal officials and was replaced by Edward Reilly. Furthermore, the Nassau County Medical Center, which provides health care to inmates, has gone from county ownership to an independent public benefit corporation.</p>
        <p>''When the hospital was a county appendage,'' said Gary Lewi, a hospital spokesman, ''there were many problems, among them a level of understaffing that led to officers dispensing medicine at the center. Today, there are nurses dispensing medicines at the jail.''</p>
        <p>The report could not have come at a worse time for the county, whose executive was locked behind closed doors today trying to come up with a balanced budget to stave off a state takeover of his administration's troubled finances.</p>
        <p>''The sheriff is reviewing the report with counsel and we are expecting his recommendation by Tuesday,'' said Diane Baumert-Moyik, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gulotta.</p>
        <p>Lisanne G. Altmann, a county legislator and outspoken critic of the jail, said that while she was most concerned about the well-being of the inmates -- two-thirds of whom are awaiting trial -- the financial consequences of the report could be devastating to the cash-strapped county.</p>
        <p>''It's obvious that doctors and nurses are going to cost more money,'' Ms. Altmann said. 'It's our obligation to provide them. The question is how?''</p>
        <p>As for the correction officers, morale could not be lower, said Mike Adams, president of their union. His members have worked without a raise or a contract for the last 3 1/2 years. Meanwhile, overtime has been scaled back and high-ranking officers are now forced to work on the inmate housing tiers because the county is having trouble attracting applicants for 80 open positions that pay $25,000 a year.</p>
        <p>''It's the toughest job in the state,'' Mr. Adams said. ''It's a large facility and there have been some instances of abuse, I'm not denying that. But are there systematic abuses here? No way. Right now we're housing 100 federal prisoners. I can't see how the feds would allow that if this report were the truth.''</p>
