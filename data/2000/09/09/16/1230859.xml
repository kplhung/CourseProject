        <p>China's Internet industry, serving one of the most promising markets, is about to undergo a sweeping consolidation after the first major merger of the industry's short life.</p>
        <p>Sohu.com, which went public on the Nasdaq market in July, said today that it would buy ChinaRen.com for 4.4 million shares, or about 12.5 percent of Sohu.com's shares outstanding.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>China's Internet industry, serving one of the most promising markets, is about to undergo a sweeping consolidation after the first major merger of the industry's short life.</p>
        <p>Sohu.com, which went public on the Nasdaq market in July, said today that it would buy ChinaRen.com for 4.4 million shares, or about 12.5 percent of Sohu.com's shares outstanding.</p>
        <p>The $30 million deal is the first of several such mergers now under discussion in China, where the Internet is jammed with thousands of under-financed, money-losing Web sites that have been surviving largely on foreign investment capital since they began appearing two years ago.</p>
        <p>That money has become increasingly scarce since Western investor appetite for Internet companies ebbed earlier this year. China does not yet allow start-up companies to sell shares to the public. And Chinese regulatory obstacles have kept all but a handful of major Chinese Internet content providers from going public abroad.</p>
        <p>As a result, many Chinese Internet companies are running near empty and some smaller ones have already closed. The rest have begun a scramble for shelter under the few companies that were able to accumulate cash while the investment dollars were flowing.</p>
        <p>Venture capitalists say the consolidation, while occurring earlier than expected in the industry's development, is healthy because few of China's Internet companies have innovative technology or original business plans that would give them a competitive edge in the global industry. Instead, China's Internet industry is all about size: with so little differentiation between companies, only a few big players are likely to attract enough traffic to survive.</p>
        <p>Sohu.com, by the acquisition of China.Ren.com, gains the largest audience of Internet users of any Chinese Internet company. According to  Sohu.com's count, its sites will receive 44 million page views a day and have a combined 7.8 million registered users. Independent tallies put the number of combined users closer to 4.5 million, and there is most certainly overlap between the two.</p>
        <p>But the merger still means that  Sohu.com will have more users than either of its next two closest rivals, Netease.com and Sina.com, both listed on Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>China has about 17 million Internet users, a number that is climbing by the day and could rise fivefold by 2003, the year that Sohu.com expects to start turning a profit.</p>
        <p>With Sohu.com now clearly in the lead, its rivals are expected to announce similar acquisitions soon. Officials at Netease.com said they hade yet to find a suitable acquisition target, while Sina.com could not be reached for comment. But both are believed to have considered offers for ChinaRen.com, which received bids from other prospective buyers.</p>
        <p>''This will definitely prompt these other companies to rethink their acquisition strategies,'' said Charles Zhang, chief executive of Sohu.com,  speaking by telephone from Beijing. ''Things will happen at an accelerated speed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zhang met one of the founders of ChinaRen.com, Joseph Chen, when they were both students in the United States, Mr. Zhang at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Mr. Chen at Stanford University. He said he first approached Mr. Chen about a merger earlier this year, but the two could not agree on what their respective companies were worth.</p>
        <p>When they spoke again after the public stock offering by Sohu.com, the company was sitting on $80 million in cash, while ChinaRen.com was reportedly running short of funds. ''Both sides got more realistic,'' Mr. Zhang said.</p>
        <p>''It was still possible for us to go it on our own, but there were many elements that were uncertain,'' Mr. Chen said.</p>
        <p>Cash-rich domestic companies have started investing in China's Internet and there is even a small venture capital industry forming in the country. Both are evaluating the government's promised establishment of a Nasdaq-style stock market in the southern city of Shenzhen, which will allow companies still in the money-burning development stage to sell stock to the public.</p>
        <p>That could radically change the fortunes of China's struggling Internet companies and other private businesses that now have limited access to capital. Currently, only large, profitable companies are allowed to sell shares on the country's two stock exchanges, situated in Shenzhen and Shanghai. And the necessary government approval to list shares is mostly reserved for state-owned companies.</p>
        <p>But it remains unclear when the Nasdaq-style capital market will open and how easily companies will be able to raise funds there. A current draft of China's new telecommunications law and a draft of regulations governing foreign investment in the industry, both circulating in the Internet community, also suggest the regulatory environment for private Internet companies could become more difficult in the future.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Chen of ChinaRen.com, many other entrepreneurs with slim revenue are likely to opt for selling now rather than risk holding out for access to capital later. China's foreign ministry is even promoting an Internet auction in Beijing at which dozens of Web sites will be put on the block.</p>
        <p>Buyouts are also the most available option for China's Internet entrepreneurs to realize their dreams of vast wealth, or even a modest payback for their efforts. While investment capital made many of them millionaires on paper, few have been able to draw more than respectable salaries from those proceeds.</p>
        <p>Selling their companies puts cash or stock directly in these entrepreneurs' hands. Mr. Chen and two Stanford classmates started their Web sites a little more than a year ago and now each owns several million dollars worth of publicly traded stock.</p>
        <p>Goldman, Sachs, a major ChinaRen investor, also profited handsomely from the deal.</p>
