        <p>Who owns a story? The inventor? Or does each teller lay claim to it simply by virtue of the telling? This is an issue that Redmoon Theater, a Chicago company, decides in its own favor in ''Hunchback,'' a captivating adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame.''</p>
        <p>The show, which is being presented tonight and tomorrow at the Joseph Papp Public Theater as part of the Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater, uses both marionettes and actors in macabre masks to represent the famous characters -- the hunchback, the innocent and beautiful gypsy Esmeralda and Dom Frollo, the tormented and tormenting archdeacon of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in 15th-century Paris. Presented on a set that consists largely of packing crates and two towers of scaffolding on wheels, the show renders the tale as an inventive amalgam of puppet show, performance art, modern ballet and circus.</p>
        <p>To describe in words the physical appeal of a show that involves creative shadows, a giant pop-up book with pages the size of easels, actors acrobatically climbing ladders that swivel like seesaws and characters represented as both life-size and puppet-size, their dimensions shifting in relation to their power over one another as the story progresses, would be to diminish its delights. It would also defy the intention, which is largely to suggest that an original telling of a familiar tale is an achievement and pleasure in itself.</p>
        <p>The production, conceived by the company's artistic director, Jim Lasko, and created in collaboration by its performers and designers, accomplishes this with an initial deception. For the first 20 minutes or so, ''Hunchback'' appears to be a dance performance or mime show, with the masked actors performing wordlessly to a cacophonous carillon-based score (by Michael Zerang) and pithy supertitles labeling the scenes -- ''The Torture of Quasimodo'' -- on a paper scroll mounted high against the rear wall of the stage.</p>
        <p>But just as the audience grows used to the narrative method, a new character, maskless, escapes from one of the packing crates onstage. He's an intruder, of sorts, not familiar from Hugo's pages; he turns out to be Hugo himself, and he has burst onto the scene to complain -- in modern idiom -- about the presentation of his story, sneering contemptuously at the ''pretty little puppets, beautiful lighting, funky music.''</p>
        <p>The Paris of 1482, he says, ''which I do not see here tonight,'' was a Paris of ''an epic foulness, and it is not here.''</p>
        <p>The character of Hugo turns out to be more comically than seriously indignant. He's an effusive, slightly neurotic fellow (his role is written by Mickle Maher but the actor who plays him is unidentified in the program) with a great sense of guardianship over his work, but he's also self-conscious about commanding the stage. He breaks the fourth wall, speaking to the audience, and he seems a bit apologetic about disturbing the continuity and the illusion.</p>
        <p>The humor is goofy but it works, mainly because Hugo arrives with uncanny timing, just when you're beginning to wonder what the point of the show's theatrics might be. His appearance gives voice to the questions you're beginning to ask yourself. Why render such a familiar story in such an idiosyncratic way? Is this staging, imaginative and peculiar as it is, meant to reveal anything new about ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame''? Or is this company just showing off?</p>
        <p>But Hugo, who turns out to be a good egg, open-minded and genuinely curious, also adds an element of postmodern burlesque. For the remainder of the show's 90 minutes, he appears intermittently: to complain further, to interfere, to peer over the shoulders of the performers as they go about their business. Eventually, guess what? He likes what he sees. In the end he is pleased with the way his tale has been told, impressed by the inventiveness of the masked performers and the puppeteers. As the audience comes to the same conclusion, that's when it dawns on you that ''Hunchback'' is more than the remake of an age-old story; it has a story all its own.</p>
