        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy has hired the elder daughter of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, to help match city schools with corporate partners that can provide volunteers and financial support.</p>
        <p>Rebecca Lieberman, 31, will start working full time at the Board of Education after Election Day, said David Klasfeld, the deputy chancellor. She will earn $75,000 a year and  will work for Freda Plesser, whom Mr. Levy hired last month to be the board's chief executive for corporate partnerships at a salary of $150,500.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy, a former lawyer at Citigroup, announced recently that a top priority this year would be creating partnerships between corporations and public schools. The point, he said, is to get more corporate volunteers into the schools and for the schools to ''have places they can turn to in the business sector as models.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lieberman, who graduated from Barnard College and the University of Pennsylvania Law School, recently left a job at the Children's Aid Society. She worked there for two years, as co-director of the public policy and client advocacy unit. Ms. Lieberman worked on a project that helped poor children in Washington Heights get Medicaid and other health benefits. ''Rebecca really provided terrific and consistent leadership,'' said Philip Coltoff, the society's executive director.</p>
        <p>Although the Board of Education is  working with City Hall to enroll more children in a state-run insurance program called Child Health Plus, Mr. Klasfeld said that Ms. Lieberman would not be part of that effort. He said that a friend of Mr. Levy's had recommended in June that he hire Ms. Lieberman. The chancellor interviewed and hired her shortly afterward, Mr. Klasfeld said.</p>
        <p>''She accepted prior to Lieberman's name surfacing as the vice presidential candidate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Since his appointment in January, Mr. Levy has been careful to appear nonpartisan. Mr. Klasfeld declined to answer a question about how Ms. Lieberman's presence on staff might help Mr. Levy's influence in Washington. But he emphasized that her responsibilities would be limited to the corporate partnership project. Ms. Lieberman will spend at least some time working for the board between now and Election Day, but it will be as a consultant, earning $300 a day, he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lieberman's new boss, Ms. Plesser, came to the board from Securities Industry Association, where she was a vice president and associate general counsel. She started working for Mr. Levy on Aug. 28.</p>
        <p>The chancellor has also hired Michael Connery, a senior labor lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, as outside counsel in the coming contract negotiations with the United Federation of Teachers. In the past, Mr. Connery helped the city negotiate contracts with the police and fireman unions. Mr. Klasfeld would not disclose what Mr. Connery's hourly rate would be.</p>
