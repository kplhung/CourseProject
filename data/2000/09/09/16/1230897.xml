        <p>Fears of widespread demonstrations on the opening day of the Olympic Games proved unwarranted, as several protests fizzled today amid the buoyant spirits in this city.</p>
        <p>About 200 people marched from Victoria Park to the office of Prime Minister John Howard to protest Australia's treatment of its Aboriginal population. The organizers had hoped for a larger turnout, but other Aboriginal leaders refused to join, saying they did not want to risk a confrontation with the Sydney police.</p>
        <p>''We don't wish to disrupt the Games,'' said Andrew Donnelley, an Aboriginal leader, who refused to take to the streets. ''Our biggest goal is to gain recognition of Aboriginal sovereignty.''</p>
        <p>Another rally, of people protesting free trade and the corporate sponsorship of the Olympics, drew barely 30 people to a suburb adjacent to the Olympic park. The police had worried that this demonstration might draw strength from people who protested at an economic conference in Melbourne last week.</p>
        <p>''We've been pleasantly surprised,'' said a spokesman for the Sydney police department. ''It's been quite calm.''</p>
        <p>The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there could still be some disruptions during the Games as demonstrators tried to take advantage of the global news media spotlight on Sydney. The police have erected barriers to keep any protests far from the Olympic village or stadium.</p>
        <p>The restraint of the Aborigines was a victory for negotiation between the government and the protesters. Several months ago, some Aboriginal leaders threatened to set cars on fire during the Games.</p>
        <p>But the local authorities negotiated with the leaders to give them a platform for their protest off the streets. The Aborigines constructed a tent city in Victoria Park -- which they call an embassy -- to dramatize their ancient claim to Australia. A sacred flame burns at the center of the tents.</p>
        <p>''Being present in a peaceful but in-your-face way highlights our struggle for human rights,'' Donnelley said.</p>
        <p>There was a noticeable police presence around Victoria Park, but the officers mingled easily with the Aborigines.</p>
        <p>Sydney had been rattled by the antiglobalization protests in Melbourne, which were among the most violent in that city's history. But a move to bring the protests to Sydney did not catch on. A plan to blockade the airport terminal on Thursday by forming a human chain fell apart for lack of participants.</p>
        <p>Today, a handful of demonstrators from Melbourne gathered in a suburb of Sydney near the Olympic Park. They inveighed against the forces of commercialism, which they said had corrupted the spirit of the Olympics. Some of the protesters rejected the Games on a more fundamental level.</p>
        <p>''The Olympics are all about nationalism, which is a step closer to racism,'' said Andrew Cheeseman, 18, a student at Melbourne University. ''Racism has led to Australia's inability to apologize to the Aborigines.''</p>
        <p>Cheeseman said the rally's poor turnout reflected a lack of planning and the natural inclination of people to view the Olympics as a positive event. The protests in Melbourne had been publicized for months.</p>
        <p>After debating their options, about 10 protesters set off in the direction of the park, while the rest headed for the train station.</p>
        <p>''What should we do now?'' a young man asked. ''Let's go to the pub,'' Cheeseman said.</p>
