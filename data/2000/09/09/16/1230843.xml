        <p>Britain and Belgium struggled today to recover from paralyzing fuel blockades while truckers elsewhere in Europe stepped up the pressure for relief from soaring gasoline and diesel prices.</p>
        <p>After a weeklong siege that saw 90 percent of Britain's 13,000 filling stations go dry, the country rushed to replenish stocks for emergency services and public transportation, but said it would be at least two weeks before supplies returned to normal for ordinary drivers.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of schools shuttered in the first week after summer vacation will remain closed for days more, mail collections on Sunday have been canceled and, in the first rationing in Britain since the years after World War II, supermarkets introduced a policy of one loaf of bread per customer.</p>
        <p>In Belgium, where the impact had been milder, the rebound was swifter. Cars, buses and streetcars flowed freely in Brussels, easing commuter frustration after five days in which the city center was closed by trucks parked across thoroughfares.</p>
        <p>In the Netherlands, however, the protests grew dramatically, with wildcat blockades bringing highway traffic in many areas to a halt and causing jams reaching up to eight miles. Drivers sounded their horns noisily outside government offices in The Hague, and road traffic was held up for hours outside the tunnel to Schipol Airport in Amsterdam, normally one of Europe's busiest.</p>
        <p>Protests were also stepped up in Germany, while truckers and farmers in Ireland, Spain and Poland joined the movement to disrupt travel as a rowdy complaint against the rising price of the highly taxed gasoline and diesel fuel. About 200 trucks, taxis and tractors put a stranglehold on the center of Bremen, Germany.</p>
        <p>Creeping convoys slowed traffic on the main ring road around Barcelona, and similar action was being mounted in Merida in the agricultural west of Spain. Irish truckers applied go-slow tactics on both country roads and the highways in and out of Dublin and four other cities.</p>
        <p>In a one-day demonstration in Poland that threatened to continue into next week, columns of trucks tied up downtown areas in Warsaw and other cities by sticking to speeds of less than 20 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>''The protests are spontaneous in nature, but there may be as many as 100,000 participating if taxis and farmers join,'' the truckers' union leader, Wojciech Zylot, told Reuters.</p>
        <p>Some stark statistics lay behind the spreading tax revolt on the Continent: Drivers pay more than twice what Americans do for gasoline, and the tax bite, 22.8 percent of the price in the United States, is more than 60 percent in Europe, with Britain topping the field at 76.2 percent. Even begrudging acceptance of those prices came to an end with the recent rise in crude oil prices to $35 a barrel, a 10-year high.</p>
        <p>The rebellion is being led largely by farmers and self-employed truckers who say the steep rise in costs is putting them out of business. Though their numbers are relatively small and their organizations have been jerry-built, they have profited from widespread consumer outrage and gained support from the very people they are inconveniencing.</p>
        <p>The protesters' effectiveness can be best measured by the success of the far-flung and rapidly expanding demonstrations in Britain that succeeded in bringing the country's economy to a virtual standstill.</p>
        <p>Government responses have varied. In France, where the protests first began broke out weeks ago, the government granted tax concessions. Belgium refused to budge on taxes but came up with an $83 million compensation plan that persuaded pickets to go home. Italy averted protests by bowing to demands for new fuel discounts.</p>
        <p>In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder has so far resisted demands to suspend taxes introduced last year in the name of conserving fuel and protecting the environment. The Irish and Dutch governments have turned down calls for trims in taxes on diesel fuel, while Spain has said it would not raise taxes but would not lower them, either.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair took a tough line in Britain, despite overwhelming public support for the protesters, saying he would not change tax rates under intimidation.</p>
        <p>The pickets left refinery gates on Thursday out of fear that their own success at disrupting life across the country might cut into their public support. While they obtained no satisfaction from the government in their central demands, the protesters threatened to throw up their blockades again if Mr. Blair did not make tax adjustments in his new budget, which is to be announced in November.</p>
