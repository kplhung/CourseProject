        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The news that African-Americans account for nearly half of death penalty referrals by federal district attorneys (news article, Sept. 13) has been cited as strong evidence of racial bias. Yet the higher homicide rate among African-Americans may be the chief reason for the racial disparity in death penalty referrals.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The news that African-Americans account for nearly half of death penalty referrals by federal district attorneys (news article, Sept. 13) has been cited as strong evidence of racial bias. Yet the higher homicide rate among African-Americans may be the chief reason for the racial disparity in death penalty referrals.</p>
        <p>According to the Department of Justice, between 1995 and 1998, African-Americans were responsible for 54 percent of all recorded homicides, for a murder rate roughly eight times that prevailing among white Americans. (African-Americans were also much more likely to be homicide victims, with a rate roughly seven times that prevailing among white Americans.)</p>
        <p>Regardless of one's view on the death penalty (I'm against it), ignoring the gap in the racial incidence of homicide can only muddy the debate as to potential racial bias in death penalty referrals.</p>
