        <p>Editorial warns that religious repression, hallmark of Soviet Union, is once again occurring in Russia, where new religious groups are not allowed to legally register</p>

        <p>This year in the Russian town of Kostroma, a panel of university professors, local government officials, a psychiatrist, a psychologist and a lawyer met to ponder whether two local Pentecostal churches should be legally registered. After watching a video of church services, the group concluded that the church leaders used ''psychological manipulation.'' The two churches were not allowed to register, and court proceedings are beginning to ban them. If this happens, their members would be able to meet in a home to pray, but they will be second-class religious citizens. Their community will not be able to distribute literature, rent or own a building, invite foreigners to preach or carry out other activities integral to religious freedom.</p>
        <p>Religious repression, a hallmark of the Soviet Union, is once again occurring in Russia today. In 1997 Russia passed a pernicious law that denied adherents of many religions full freedom to worship and forced them through a burdensome registration process that put them at the mercy of local authorities, like those in Kostroma. The law was written in consultation with the Russian Orthodox Church, and played into the government's desire for central control and the unease of ordinary Russians about the explosion of new and unfamiliar churches and an influx of foreign missionaries.</p>

        <p>This year in the Russian town of Kostroma, a panel of university professors, local government officials, a psychiatrist, a psychologist and a lawyer met to ponder whether two local Pentecostal churches should be legally registered. After watching a video of church services, the group concluded that the church leaders used ''psychological manipulation.'' The two churches were not allowed to register, and court proceedings are beginning to ban them. If this happens, their members would be able to meet in a home to pray, but they will be second-class religious citizens.

        <p>Religious repression, a hallmark of the Soviet Union, is once again occurring in Russia today. In 1997 Russia passed a pernicious law that denied adherents of many religions full freedom to worship and forced them through a burdensome registration process that put them at the mercy of local authorities, like those in Kostroma. The law was written in consultation with the Russian Orthodox Church, and played into the government's desire for central control and the unease of ordinary Russians about the explosion of new and unfamiliar churches and an influx of foreign missionaries.</p>
        <p>President Vladimir Putin has modified the law. Since only half of Russia's religious organizations had registered by the December 1999 deadline, he extended it one year. But he also made it a requirement, instead of an option, that groups that do not register or whose applications are rejected be banned and lose their rights.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union's religious organizations could register with the government in 1990, but the process was pro forma and voluntary. Today, new groups independent of a centralized religious organization cannot register at all. Other groups must re-apply with a thick package of material documenting the history of their religion and other information.</p>
        <p>According to the Keston Institute, a group based in Oxford, England, that monitors religious freedom in the former Communist world, many churches have been repeatedly rejected on technicalities. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a group established by Congress in 1998 to advise the government, reports that minority religions have had far more difficulties than the Russian Orthodox Church. In the Voronezh region, for example, authorities moved to ban Baptist, Jewish, Lutheran and several Pentecostal groups -- but not local Russian Orthodox organizations that failed to re-register.</p>
        <p>President Clinton and other American officials have repeatedly brought up the religion law in meetings with their Russian counterparts, which is appropriate. President Putin's support for religious tolerance is unclear. He should be lobbied hard to bring discriminatory Russian and local laws into line with Russia's constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion.</p>
