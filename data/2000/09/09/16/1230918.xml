        <p>Merger negotiations between GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric, and Scottish Life, an Edinburgh-based mutual life insurance company, have been abandoned, people close to the negotiations said. GE Capital had been near a deal to buy Scottish Life for more than $:1 billion ($1.4 billion), but negotiations soured when new bidders emerged at the last minute, these people said. Scottish Life said that it had received proposals from interested parties, but declined to identify them. Likely candidates are Royal London Mutual Insurance Society Ltd. and Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society.</p>
