        <p>Lisa Leslie, the starting center for the United States women's basketball team, was asked if she thought Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal should be here to represent the American men.</p>
        <p>''It would be nice, but they had long seasons and need their rest,'' Leslie said, referring to the two Los Angeles Lakers who declined invitations to play.</p>
        <p>Such is the mind-set of many elite National Basketball Association players regarding the Sydney Games. With the time commitment and the travel before N.B.A. training camps open the first week of October, who has a spare minute to take China, Italy and the rest of the world to school?</p>
        <p>As the Olympic basketball tournament opened this weekend -- the women were scheduled to play on Saturday against North Korea and the men meet China on Sunday -- the Americans find themselves in an almost unenviable position.</p>
        <p>Beyond the gold medals, they cannot win. If they are not dominant enough, the world is catching up. If they clobber their opponents by 50 points -- a distinct possibility in several of the men's preliminary games -- detractors will wonder if sending American professionals to the Olympics was a good idea in the first place.</p>
        <p>They essentially killed their chances for ambassadorship last Saturday night by forearming and trash-talking the Australian national teams in back-to-back exhibitions that left the crowd of 15,000-plus in Melbourne with one collective thought.</p>
        <p>''They're so good already, why do the Americans have to behave like that?'' said the 19-year-old Australian center Lauren Jackson, who was involved in a minor altercation with Sheryl Swoopes and Leslie in the second half of the United States women's victory.</p>
        <p>In their initial news conference on Friday morning before the tournament, the United States men did not endear themselves to the international news media. Bland, distracted and clearly ready to play instead of talk, they arrived 15 minutes late, fielded most of their questions from a team public-relations official and left about 10 minutes earlier than scheduled.</p>
        <p>''We're worried about winning,'' said Allan Houston, the Knicks' All-Star guard, who sprained his right wrist in practice on Wednesday and may miss at least the opener. ''Who we are is who we are. We don't have any knucklehead on this team that's going to misrepresent the United States any way. We're not going out there to do anything crazy.''</p>
        <p>The American women were much more personable and forthcoming during their session with the news media. But even they were subjected to questions as to why they chose to stay at a hotel away from Olympic Park rather than stay in the Olympic Village with the rest of the world's athletes.</p>
        <p>The entire Australian Olympic team -- even celebrities like the tennis pro Patrick Rafter and the 17-year-old swimming phenom Ian Thorpe -- is living at the village for the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>Leslie acknowledged that she and her teammates would miss out on part of the Olympic experience, but also added, ''We want to be treated like the men.''</p>
        <p>While both teams are defending the gold medals they won in Atlanta four years ago -- the United States men are undefeated in Olympic play since the original Dream Team rolled through Barcelona, Spain, in 1992 -- there is more competitive pressure on the women.</p>
        <p>If Russia, Cuba and Brazil have the ammunition to dethrone the Americans, so does the host country.</p>
        <p>''I think it's only natural to feel like, 'Hey, you guys are down here in our country and we're not just going to let you come in and take the gold medal,' '' Leslie said. ''And I do believe you have an advantage playing in your own country. I recognized that in Atlanta. I think we do have a bigger challenge to go win a gold medal in someone else's backyard.''</p>
        <p>Beyond their own critics, who keep insisting they are the Diet Coke version of a true Dream Team, the men have some obstacles, too.</p>
        <p>Yugoslavia, which won the world championship in 1998 by beating a team of non-N.B.A. players in Athens and also won the silver medal in Atlanta, will feature Predrag Stojakovic of the Sacramento Kings and Predrag Danilovic, the former Miami Heat guard. And Australia has Luc Longley of the Phoenix Suns and Chris Anstey of the Chicago Bulls on its front line. The Australian backcourt is also decent, with Shane Heal, the feisty dyed-blond point guard, and Andrew Gaze, who is playing in his fifth Olympics, as is Team USA's Teresa Edwards.</p>
        <p>''Their athleticism and skill level and size and experience put them in a league of their own,'' Longley said of the Americans. ''But we have to believe they're beatable. In order to carry that through the games, the right set of circumstances would involve creeping up on them.</p>
        <p>''From a competitive point of view, you're out of your mind to play for second best. You shoot for the stars and hit the moon.''</p>
        <p>Comparing this year's American men with the original Dream Team, Gaze said: ''I think they are equally as talented, no question, but they don't have that mystique right now.''</p>
        <p>After losing by 30 points or more in 1992, players from other nations often asked Michael Jordan, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson for their autographs. Traipsing through Barcelona like royalty, they won by an average of almost 44 points a game.</p>
        <p>Alonzo Mourning, the current team's co-captain, conceded that such a winning margin might be hard to beat. In any event, he added, it would be hard to measure up to the hype and novelty surrounding the first essentially N.B.A. team to play in the Olympics.</p>
        <p>Indeed, beyond a gold medal, they cannot win.</p>
