        <p>Rutgers and Virginia Tech are 2-0. The Scarlet Knights already know the similarities between these two football teams end right there.</p>
        <p>Rutgers is considered an overwhelming underdog for Saturday's Big East opener against the No. 8-ranked Hokies. The Scarlet Knights understand they will have to play perfect football to win at Virginia Tech.</p>
        <p>''We have got to play as fast as our legs can carry us,'' Rutgers Coach Terry Shea said this week.</p>
        <p>An upset would be seismic.</p>
        <p>Last season, when the teams met, the score was tied, 14-14, when Rutgers quarterback Mike McMahon left the game with a shoulder injury.</p>
        <p>These Scarlet Knights have one element that has apparently not been in plentiful supply at Rutgers: togetherness.</p>
        <p>''The confidence was there the whole time,'' the junior fullback Dennis Thomas said. ''We just weren't together as a team.''</p>
        <p>Rutgers made few mistakes in dispatching Villanova and Buffalo. Rutgers, 2-0 for the first time in six years, is plus-5 in turnovers and has been penalized six fewer times than its opponents.</p>
        <p>Villanova and Buffalo were, well, Villanova and Buffalo, but even so the Rutgers offense was strikingly efficient against its two opening opponents. McMahon has 10 touchdown passes, and he has been sacked only twice and thrown one interception.</p>
        <p>''Looks like he knows exactly what he's doing,'' Virginia Tech Coach Frank Beamer said of McMahon.</p>
        <p>McMahon summed up the Rutgers season, so far, by saying, ''This offense is just lots of fun.''</p>
        <p>Virginia Tech, however, is not a fun place to play. The Hokies have won 15 of their last 16 Big East games at Lane Stadium. The stadium is expanding, as is the interest in Hokie football.</p>
        <p>''We got three new motels in town, and in Blacksburg, that's news,'' Beamer said.</p>
        <p>Michael Vick surely has something to do with that. He has not been quite as sensational as he was during his redshirt freshman season, when he finished third in the Heisman Trophy balloting. But he has not had to be sensational at quarterback, either. Tech has found a flashy runner, Lee Suggs, to replace its 1,000-yard rusher Shyrone Stith.</p>
        <p>Shea has said that Rutgers's priority on defense will be to prevent the Hokies from manhandling the Scarlet Knights on the line of scrimmage.</p>
        <p>''Do you take away Vick?'' Shea said. ''I don't think you can.''</p>
        <p>Rutgers has not had a victory on the road since 1998, has not defeated Virginia Tech since 1992 and has not defeated a ranked opponent since 1988. But Shea is a football coach, and every football coach is both a preacher and a spin doctor.</p>
        <p>Shea's message to his team this week went like this: Even though Rutgers lost to Tech, 58-20, last year, the game was close until McMahon was injured.</p>
        <p>Besides Vick, Virginia Tech is not as talented, especially on defense, as it was last year, when it was defeated by Florida State for the national championship.</p>
        <p>Shea thinks Rutgers has a chance to at least be competitive on Saturday. ''These guys can be scored upon,'' he said of Virginia Tech. ''You don't lose as many guys as they've lost and not feel the impact.''</p>
        <p>Shea has been careful not to load too much new strategy on his players this week. He said he thought his team would have a better chance if it can play efficiently. Don't look for gadget plays and trickery.</p>
        <p>The game still is a major step up in class for Rutgers. That might be why McMahon has politely refused to participate in any comparisons with Vick. The Tech defense will be enough of a problem for the Scarlet Knights quarterback.</p>
        <p>''And that's the defense's job, to stop him,'' McMahon said, laughing.</p>
