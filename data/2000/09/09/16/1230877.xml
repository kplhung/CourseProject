        <p>They may be unbeaten thanks to a pair of late comebacks, but the Jets know these heroics go just so far. And it might be especially dangerous to wind up trailing late in the game against the stingy defense of the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.</p>
        <p>So today, Coach Al Groh used what he described as a loud voice -- one of the oldest coaching techniques -- to discuss one area the Jets need to improve dramatically: special teams.</p>
        <p>It is also the one area a team can improve by the force of its will. A team does not need a talented quarterback or a marauding pass rusher to tackle a punt returner or make a key block.</p>
        <p>If the Jets had been better at returning kicks, or had better coverage on their opponents' returns, in the first two games, they might not have been thrust into those dramatic situations that rescued the team. Despite a 2-0 start, the Jets have been bad in an area in which they once excelled.</p>
        <p>*The Jets average 1.7 yards per punt return, about 5 feet apiece.</p>
        <p>*Their opponents average 27.2 yards per punt return.</p>
        <p>*The Jets average 18.2 yards returning kickoffs.</p>
        <p>*Their opponents average 23.9 yards returning kickoffs.</p>
        <p>But the Jets are not the only team having problems with the kicking game. The Bills (2-0) have also come up short on special teams, an aspect of their game that virtually defined the team through most of the 1990's. That was when they had Steve Tasker making the Pro Bowl for his kick-return coverage. And they also had Marv Levy, a head coach who made sure the proper emphasis was placed on the unit.</p>
        <p>But in last season's wild-card game against the Titans, the Bills were defeated when Tennessee returned a kickoff 75 yards for a touchdown. This forced Buffalo to make changes. It began when Coach Wade Phillips dismissed Bruce DeHaven, the special teams coach for 13 seasons, and replaced him with Ronnie Jones.</p>
        <p>The Jets, despite their problems, actually have a better average returning punts than the Bills, who are mired at 1.6 yards. The Bills also average only 16.9 yards returning kickoffs.</p>
        <p>Groh describes the yardage differential that teams yield or accumulate in areas like kick returns and penalties as ''hidden yardage.'' It was also a favorite statistic of his predecessor, Bill Parcells, who said that every 100 yards of hidden yardage was worth 7 points.</p>
        <p>''If you have problems on offense and defense, that may be more difficult to address,'' Groh said. ''But the problems on hidden yardage are often execution problems.''</p>
        <p>The Jets are attempting to add more speed to their special teams this week, and they may also use more veterans on the unit. Last week, they used linebacker Mo Lewis, as well as Marcus Coleman, a starting cornerback.</p>
        <p>''The only special teams I played on in recent years was when someone was hurt,'' Lewis said.</p>
        <p>The Jets are trying to offset the loss of three players who were especially effective on special teams last season: Dwight Stone, Casey Dailey and Robert Farmer. All three have been cut.</p>
        <p>Last season, Dailey downed three balls inside the 10-yard line after Chris Hayes made sparkling plays to bat back punts. Last Monday night, Hayes charged into the end zone and swatted back a Tom Tupa punt. The ball came out to the 1-yard line, but the rookie Tony Scott inadvertently got in the way, and the ball bounded into the end zone. The Patriots took over on the 20-yard line instead.</p>
        <p>''We need someone to make a monster play, someone to rally around,'' Hayes said. ''Then we'll get going.'' Hayes said that John Abraham, the rookie linebacker whom he described as a future impact player, could be that special player.</p>
        <p>Groh has a soft spot for special teams. After all, he was once in charge of the unit for the Atlanta Falcons, in 1987.</p>
        <p>His debut in that role, he recalled, made him more nervous than he was for his first game as the head coach of the Jets two weeks ago at Green Bay.</p>
        <p>''You're coaching all 11 guys on special teams by yourself,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Now he has help, but special teams are still are on his mind.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>KEYSHAWN JOHNSON will hold three news conferences next week in what is expected to be a deluge by the news media before the Jets play at Tampa Bay against the Bucs. . . . Coach AL GROH said he would be happier if the new grass field at Giants Stadium were ''a little firmer.''</p>
