        <p>Rickey Henderson scored two runs to pass Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron and move into second place on the career list as the Seattle Mariners beat the Baltimore Orioles, 10-2, last night at Camden Yards.</p>
        <p>Aaron Sele, who almost signed with the Orioles during the off-season, pitched seven strong innings as the Mariners maintained their two-game lead in the American League West over Oakland. The Athletics beat Tampa Bay, 17-3.</p>
        <p>Henderson has scored 2,175 runs, one more than Ruth and Aaron, and trails only the career leader, Ty Cobb (2,245). He also drew two walks, moving within two of tying Ruth for first place on the career list (2,056).</p>
        <p>RED SOX 7, TIGERS 6: Scott Hatteberg hit a tie-breaking single in the ninth inning to lift Boston at Comerica Park. The Red Sox remained two games behind Cleveland in the A.L. wild card race. The Indians beat the Yankees, 11-1.</p>
        <p>The teams tied an A.L. record by using 42 players.</p>
        <p>BLUE JAYS 6, WHITE SOX 5: Alex Gonzalez and Darrin Fletcher homered off the struggling Chicago rookie Jon Garland.</p>
        <p>The 20-year-old Garland (3-7), the youngest pitcher in the majors, has not made it past the fifth inning in three starts since coming off the disabled list 11 days ago. He gave up six hits, including two homers, and six runs, with five walks.</p>
        <p>ATHLETICS 17, DEVIL RAYS 3: Jason Giambi hit a grand slam and tied a career-high with seven runs batted in for visiting Oakland.</p>
        <p>Giambi set an Oakland record with his fourth grand slam of the season in the third inning.</p>
        <p>The Athletics tied a major league record with their 12th grand slam this season. Atlanta (1997) and Cleveland (1999) also accomplished the feat.</p>
        <p>ANGELS 16, TWINS 5: Tim Salmon matched a career high with his 34th home run and visiting Anaheim had a season-high 21 hits.</p>
        <p>Every starter for Anaheim had at least one hit, as the Angels scored 16 runs for the second time this season.</p>
        <p>RANGERS 12, ROYALS 11: Kelly Dransfeldt hit an R.B.I. single with two outs that capped a two-run rally in the bottom of the 10th inning and Texas rallied to win after blowing an eight-run lead.</p>
        <p>Rafael Palmeiro hit his 37th homer of the season and 398th of his career.</p>
        <p>UNIQUE DOUBLEHEADER: The Cleveland Indians will probably play both the Minnesota Twins and the Chicago White Sox on the same day, Sept. 25.</p>
        <p>The Indians will play that day after returning to Cleveland from a 12-game, 10-day road trip that includes consecutive day-night doubleheaders in Boston.</p>
        <p>The Indians would make up last Sunday's rainout against the White Sox at Jacobs Field on the afternoon of Sept. 25, then play the regularly scheduled game against Minnesota that night.</p>
        <p>It would be the first time a major league team will play two opponents on the same day since Sept. 13, 1951, when the St. Louis Cardinals were at home against the New York Giants and Boston Braves, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.</p>
