        <p>ELLEN JOHNSON lives in a ranch house here with her husband and two children and a dog that follows her from room to room. Children's bicycles are sprawled on the lawn, and an apple pie is waiting in the kitchen. All in all, some may see it as a rather wholesome setting for the most outspoken atheist in America.</p>
        <p>As president of American Atheists, Mrs. Johnson is carrying on the legacy of Madalyn Murray O'Hair, the often profane and much maligned foe of school prayer and the pledge of allegiance. Mrs. O'Hair disappeared in 1995 with her son and granddaughter under mysterious circumstances, leaving this suburban mom to carry on the cause.</p>
        <p>Here she is in her home office, biographies of Abraham Lincoln at hand, churning out editorials in response to Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's headline-generating speech in a Detroit church in August, when he called for more religion in public life, saying, ''George Washington warned us never to indulge the supposition 'that morality can be maintained without religion.' ''</p>
        <p>To Mrs. Johnson, this was offensive. She interpreted the Democratic vice-presidential candidate as saying that atheists are immoral, which she says is ''a stereotype'' just as offensive as saying that all blacks are on welfare, Jews are cheap and gays are promiscuous.</p>
        <p>''That's an insult. There is no connection between morality and religion,'' she says. ''Otherwise, professional religious people like priests wouldn't be molesting children.''</p>
        <p>SHE sees herself as a member of a misunderstood and mostly closeted minority, ''like gay people in the 60's,'' on the cusp of a great civil rights struggle. She speaks of Rosa Parks and Stonewall, smoothing the flounced hem of her dress.</p>
        <p>''We have a second generation of atheists now, people my age having children,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ''And these are people who for most of their lives were able to keep their atheism to themselves. But now I've got these children, and they're having trouble in the public schools, things like the prayers over the intercoms. And the parents are saying, 'If you mess with my kid, I'm coming out of the closet.' ''</p>
        <p>Religious conservatives complain about creeping secularism, but the contemporaneous truth is that these are hard days for atheists in America. States are posting the Ten Commandments in courthouses, students are praying around flagpoles and at football games, and Capitol Hill is hosting Bible studies.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Johnson picketed outside the Republican convention in Philadelphia, and then the Democratic convention in Los Angeles, because the presidential candidates of both parties support funneling more tax dollars to social service programs run by religious groups.</p>
        <p>''You have to be an atheist in America to know how this feels,'' she said. ''We're told if you don't like it, leave the classroom, leave the courtroom, leave the legislature, you leave. If you don't like where we're praying, leave the football game. We're being marginalized. Atheists have had it.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Johnson first realized she was a true believer in atheism after hearing Mrs. O'Hair on television in 1979. She wrote her a letter of support, and was immediately made chapter head for New Jersey. Mrs. Johnson says she grew close to Mrs. O'Hair, who reminded her of her mother -- both irreverent iconoclasts, always questioning authority.</p>
        <p>Mrs. O'Hair vanished in 1995 with her son, Jon Garth Murray, and her granddaughter, Robin Murray O'Hair.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors now believe that the three were kidnapped by a former bookkeeper of American Atheists and two of his ex-convict friends. Investigators cracked the case after finding a headless, handless torso in Texas, and identifying it as one of the three accomplices. One of the three accused in the case was convicted of conspiracy in June.</p>
        <p>The O'Hairs are presumed dead, but their bodies have never been found.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Johnson and a small group have resuscitated the organization. They moved the headquarters from Austin to Cranford, N.J., where a bequest allowed them to buy a new office, Mrs. Johnson said. American Atheists, only one of several national organizations for nonbelievers, has 1,500 members, four staff members, and volunteer directors in 22 states.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Johnson says she is raising her own children as third-generation atheists. Instead of Christmas, they celebrate the Winter Solstice with presents, a big dinner, solstice greeting cards, and a tree decorated with sun ornaments, because ''children want rituals.''</p>
        <p>''The world around you, that's atheism,'' she said she teaches her children. ''It's science, it's learning, it's love, it's family, it's reality. It's not trying to escape out of reality into this world that never existed. There aren't angels spying on you. We have reality.''</p>
        <p>She has told them they do not have to say the pledge of allegiance at school, but they do ''because they do not want to stand out,'' she said, and that is fine.</p>
        <p>But the most painful passage yet, she said, was when her 11-year- old son could not join the Boy Scouts because he would not say the oath about belief in God.</p>
        <p>Why not allow her son to just join the Boy Scouts, and mumble something instead of the oath? she was asked. Mrs. Johnson was quick to respond.</p>
        <p>''And be a liar?'' she said. To an atheist, that would not be moral.</p>
