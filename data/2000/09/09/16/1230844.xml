        <p>In excoriating officials for their treatment of Wen Ho Lee, Federal District Judge James A. Parker said one question remained unanswered: ''What was the government's motive?'' There is an answer to that question, a chilling one. It is: politics.</p>
        <p>In the winter of 1999, Republicans found what they thought was a promising theme. The Clinton administration, they said, is soft on Chinese nuclear espionage. It was an updated version of the charge that Richard Nixon and others had used so devastatingly, that Democrats were soft on Communism.</p>
        <p>Dan Quayle charged the administration with ''appeasement'' of China in ''espionage involving our most critical secrets.'' Republicans in Congress attacked the president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, for supposed laxity in dealing with Chinese spying. Conservative columnists joined the chorus.</p>
        <p>A House committee under Representative Christopher Cox, Republican of California, issued a 900-page report saying that China had been stealing our nuclear weapons secrets. Experts pointed out that the report was long on conjecture and short on evidence. But the committee's Democrats, evidently panicked, joined it without dissent.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration moved quickly to meet the Republican attack. Among other things Bill Richardson, the secretary of energy, appointed a ''security czar.''</p>
        <p>Then a villain was found -- someone to blame: Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. In March 1999 he was fired. In December the U.S. Attorney's office in Albuquerque, N.M., had a grand jury indict him on 59 counts of mishandling nuclear secrets -- with a potential penalty of life in prison.</p>
        <p>In the months after that indictment Mr. Lee was painted in the darkest tones. He was said to have compromised the ''crown jewels'' of U.S. nuclear weapons. Government investigators compared him to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted of giving atomic secrets to the Soviet Union and executed in 1953.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors gave Judge Parker, as he told Mr. Lee the other day, ''information that was so extreme it convinced me that releasing you, even under the most stringent of conditions, would be a danger to the safety of this nation.''</p>
        <p>At the prosecutors' urging, the judge denied bail. Mr. Lee was held in what Judge Parker called ''demeaning, unnecessarily punitive conditions'' -- in solitary confinement, allowed to exercise only an hour a day with his legs shackled, the lights kept on in his cell 24 hours a day.</p>
        <p>In recent months the hyperbolic picture of Mr. Lee and his supposed offenses faded away. Robert Messemer, an F.B.I. agent who testified that in two incidents Mr. Lee had been deceptive, admitted that his account of those two incidents was false. It was ''an honest mistake,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The great secrets to which Mr. Lee had access -- and of which he had wrongly made computer tapes -- turned out to be not so secret. Many  had been available in thousands of sources.</p>
        <p>But no one in the government backed off. Prosecutors continued to insist that Mr. Lee was a terrible danger to the nation.</p>
        <p>It was Judge Parker who pierced the stubborn denial of reality. When he made clear that he had had enough, prosecutors signed a plea agreement that let Mr. Lee go with the 278 days he had served in prison. It amounted, Judge Parker said, to a concession ''that it was not necessary to confine you last December or at any time before your trial.''</p>
        <p>I do not think that Secretary Richardson or Attorney General Janet Reno decided overtly to use the Lee case for political purposes. I think that, feeling the political pressure, they allowed their judgment to be shockingly distorted.</p>
        <p>For the Justice Department especially to go on and on with a case so weak is profoundly disturbing. To let the terrible weapon of criminal prosecution be used in a politically convenient way is a hallmark of tyranny.</p>
        <p>The lead prosecutor in the case, George Stamboulidis, unregenerate after Mr. Lee's release, suggested that Judge Parker did not understand the national security issues. To the contrary, this country's security rests in good part on having judges with the character and courage, like Judge Parker, to do their duty despite prosecutorial alarms and excursions.</p>
