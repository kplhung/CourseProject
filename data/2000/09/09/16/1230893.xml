        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had radioactive seeds implanted in his prostate gland early yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center, then appeared six hours later at a news conference with the relief and good humor of a patient who had gone through a cancer treatment that was not as bad as he had feared.</p>
        <p>''You go through any form of a surgical procedure, you get a little tense and you get a little nervous,'' Mr. Giuliani said at an afternoon news conference attended by his doctors, his senior advisers and Judith Nathan, his close friend. ''And once it's over, you say to yourself, 'Gee, that was easier than I thought it would be.' ''</p>
        <p>The mayor entered the hospital at 6:30 a.m. for the hourlong procedure, which began at 6:55 a.m. and was performed by his urologist, Stanley M. Kirschenbaum, and his radiation oncologist, Richard A. Stock. While Dr. Kirschenbaum monitored with ultrasound, Dr. Stock implanted 90 radioactive palladium metal pellets, each the size of a grain of rice, in the mayor's prostate. Mr. Giuliani was given a local anesthetic, numbing him from the waist down, as well as a mild sedative.</p>
        <p>Both doctors said the procedure went well and that Mr. Giuliani's prognosis was excellent. The mayor, they said, listened to a favorite compact disc that filled the operating room with the voices of the tenors Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani was taken to the hospital's recovery room by 8:30 a.m. He remained there until shortly before 2 p.m., when he walked easily into the news conference, took a seat at a table between his two doctors and immediately began a patter of jokes and light-hearted remarks. ''The time that I spent this morning between 8 and 9 was not nearly as painful as most of my morning meetings,'' he said. ''And there was less fighting between all the doctors in the operating room and my deputy mayors, commissioners, assistants and the mayor. So this was actually a much quieter and more peaceful morning than I usually have.''</p>
        <p>He also gestured to the hospital identification band on his wrist and said: ''This is in case I start wandering around tonight. If I'm caught wandering in Carl Schurz Park, they know where to return me.''</p>
        <p>After the news conference, the mayor left the hospital to spend the night at Gracie Mansion.</p>
        <p>The mayor appeared more relaxed and open about his cancer treatment than he has in months. He said for the first time that sometimes he experienced up to eight hot flashes a day because of his hormone therapy, a preliminary cancer treatment to reduce his levels of testosterone that began in May. ''Some days I'll have serious ones, and some days they'll just be -- you get a little sweaty,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''And they're bearable. I mean, it's not an unbearable situation. They're just annoying.''</p>
        <p>He also said that the continuing  hormone therapy had at times made him unusually fatigued. ''Maybe every six or seven days, I would get a day in which I was extraordinarily tired,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''The other days I was normal or maybe even more energetic than normal.''</p>
        <p>The seeds are the second phase of what the mayor described as his three-phase cancer treatment, with hormone therapy as the first and external radiation as the third. The goal of the second and third phases is to eradicate the cancer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's doctors said that after two months, Mr. Giuliani would begin receiving doses of radiation from a radiation beam aimed at his prostate for 15 minutes a day, Monday through Friday, for five weeks. The mayor's hormone therapy, which consists of an injection and pill taken once a month, will continue for three or four more months. Last month, Mr. Giuliani said that the hormone therapy had reduced the levels of prostate-specific antigen in his blood to small amounts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said he expected to return to work on Monday or Tuesday and that he had no specific plans for the weekend but would ''play it by ear.'' His staff said the mayor would be resting Saturday and Sunday at Gracie Mansion. Mr. Giuliani's estranged wife, Donna Hanover, and the couple's two children, who are living at Gracie Mansion, will spend the weekend in Atlanta at the wedding of one of Mr. Giuliani's cousins.</p>
        <p>''I'm doing everything possible under the circumstances to help him,'' Ms. Hanover said at a news conference at the Plaza Hotel yesterday after receiving an award for her support of breast cancer research. ''I'm also keeping life as normal as possible for our children.'' She added, ''We are grateful for all the prayers that are being said for Rudy's recovery.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said that he had spoken by phone to his children, Andrew, 14, and Caroline, 11, after the procedure. ''I explained to them that I'm doing very well,'' he said. ''I described this to them as something like going to a procedure in a doctor's office, because I was pretty sure I was going to get out today.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's doctors said the seeds in the mayor's prostate would give off radiation over the next two months, and as a precaution they have told him that he should stay at least three feet away from pregnant women. They also have told the mayor that he should not get close to  children 2 years old or younger.</p>
        <p>''You wouldn't take a baby, plop it down on your lap and watch TV for an hour,'' Dr. Stock said in an interview. ''If you had a baby for a second, really it wouldn't make much of a difference. But we're just very cautious in general for all patients.''</p>
        <p>Such restrictions would have posed considerable complications in campaigning had Mr. Giuliani remained as the Republican candidate in the Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton. Yesterday, the mayor said again that he had almost no regrets in abandoning the race on May 19, when he cited his prostate cancer as the reason for withdrawing. ''I couldn't have run it the way I would have wanted to,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''I'm incapable of running a campaign and being distracted.'' He added that ''on those days when I have to take a nap for half a day, or I feel extra tired,'' he would either have taken the nap and felt guilty or have tried to campaign ''and probably not done a good job.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giuliani said he did feel a twinge of regret while watching Wednesday's debate between Mrs. Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio, the man who took his place. ''I was thinking, 'Well, gee, if I were doing the debate, I would do it this way, I would do it that way,' '' Mr. Giuliani said. But he declined to say more. ''I'm not going to tell you what I have done differently,'' he said cheerfully. ''It's all in your head, really.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's decision about his treatment has taken nearly five months. When Mr. Giuliani announced on April 27 that he had an early form of prostate cancer, he said that he and his doctors would make a decision about treatment within two weeks. But by the time he withdrew from the Senate race on May 19, Mr. Giuliani said that he had been tortured by indecision and needed more time. As recently as Aug. 31, Mr. Giuliani said he still had not made a final decision.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani said he ''made the decision to do it this way 100 percent about two or three weeks ago.'' Although most men his age, 56, opt for surgical removal of the prostate, Mr. Giuliani said that his choice ''made the most sense for me.''</p>
        <p>Although surgery has a high cure rate, it can also cause impotence and incontinence. Many doctors say that radiation seeds may affect sexual function less, but their long-term cure rates are not as well known.</p>
        <p>''It's a very complex issue, and the mayor really took his time, and did a lot of research and probably knows more than we do at this point about prostate cancer,'' Dr. Stock said yesterday. ''My feeling is that radiation tends to offer some improvement in potency preservation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani extensively thanked his City Hall staff by name for their support. He also turned to look at Ms. Nathan, who was standing nearby. ''I want to thank Judith for being here,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''Thank you.''</p>
        <p>Then the mayor continued the news conference after his press secretary, Sunny Mindel, cut it off.</p>
        <p>''Any questions? On other subjects?'' Mr. Giuliani said, and then launched unprovoked into an analysis of the Clinton-Lazio debate. ''Frankly, there's not a thing that I could have done better in that debate,'' he said. ''In fact, I'm not sure I would have done it as well.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 18, 2000, Monday  An article on Saturday about the medical procedure undergone by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to treat his prostate cancer misstated the given name of his urologist. He is Dr. Alexander M. Kirschenbaum, not Stanley.</p>
