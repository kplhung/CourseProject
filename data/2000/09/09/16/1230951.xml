        <p>NO. 6 FLORIDA 2-0  NO. 11 at TENNESSEE 1-0  Maybe the game of the year in the Southeastern Conference. Florida has not measured up to the Gator standards of old, and although quarterback Jesse Palmer will start this week, Coach Steve Spurrier seems ready to bench him. Tennessee's offense had a tough time against a good Southern Mississippi team.TV: CH2, 3:30 P.M.</p>

        <p>NO. 6 FLORIDA 2-0  NO. 11 at TENNESSEE 1-0  Maybe the game of the year in the Southeastern Conference. Florida has not measured up to the Gator standards of old, and although quarterback Jesse Palmer will start this week, Coach Steve Spurrier seems ready to bench him. Tennessee's offense had a tough time against a good Southern Mississippi team.TV: CH2, 3:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>NO. 13 PURDUE 2-0  NO. 21 at NOTRE DAME 1-1  In its overtime loss to Nebraska, Notre Dame lost quarterback Arnaz Battle, probably for the season, with a broken left wrist. His replacement is Gary Godsey, a 6-foot-7-inch converted tight end, backed by three freshmen. Unless the Irish stop Drew Brees's passing, they have little chance.  TV: CH4, 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>NO. 3 MICHIGAN 2-0  NO. 14 at U.C.L.A. 2-0  Injuries will force both teams to start backup quarterbacks -- John Navarre for Michigan and Ryan McCann for U.C.L.A. Both teams have outstanding running backs and both are playing good defense. Michigan, with its controlled passing, is a potential national champion.TV: CH7, 3:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>EAST  Penn State (1-2) at Pittsburgh (2-0)  Penn State's 67-7 rout of Louisiana Tech last Saturday may be deceptive. ''We're not that good,'' Coach Joe Paterno said.</p>
        <p>Fordham (1-1) at Columbia (0-0)  Beware of Fordham, which snapped a 12-game losing streak last week.</p>
        <p>Dayton (2-0) at Yale (0-0)  If bigger and stronger Yale prevails, it will become college football's first 800-game winner.</p>
        <p>Princeton (0-0) at Lafayette (0-1)  Roger Hughes, who created a big passing game as Dartmouth's offensive coordinator, makes his debut as Princeton's head coach.</p>
        <p>SOUTH  North Carolina (2-0) at No. 2 Florida State (2-0)  Although Chris Weinke passed for 443 yards in Florida State's tough victory over Georgia Tech, he warned, ''We need to get the killer instinct.''</p>
        <p>Louisiana State (2-0) at No. 24 Auburn (2-0)  Auburn, 112th of the 114 Division I-A teams in rushing last year, ran for 261 yards against Mississippi.  TV: ESPN, 7:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>No. 25 Southern Miss (0-1) vs. No. 15 Alabama (1-1)  at Birmingham, Ala.  Alabama beat Vanderbilt with 292 yards rushing, 136 in the fourth quarter.  TV: ESPN2, 9 p.m.</p>
        <p>MIDWEST  Cincinnati (2-0) at No. 4 Wisconsin (2-0)  Wisconsin remembers last year's stunning upset loss to Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>Miami, Ohio (2-0) at No. 17 Ohio State (2-0)  Ohio State's defense allowed Arizona only 194 yards in total offense last week, with 8 sacks and 12 punts.  TV: CH9, Noon</p>
        <p>California (1-0) at No. 19 Illinois (2-0)  Illinois should win on Kurt Kittner's passing (six touchdowns in two games).  TV: ESPN, Noon</p>
        <p>No. 22 Michigan State (1-0) at Missouri (1-1)  T.J. Duckett of Michigan State, who ran for 219 yards against Rice last week, is down to 252 pounds after eliminating cheeseburgers and late-night pizzas.</p>
        <p>SOUTHWEST  Northwestern (2-0)  at No. 20 Texas Christian (1-0)  T.C.U. routed Nevada with 15 sacks last week, 12 in the first half.  TV: FSNY, Noon.</p>
        <p>Army (0-2) at Houston (0-2)  Two struggling teams with new coaches. Army gave up 587 yards to Boston College last week.</p>
        <p>FAR WEST  No. 5 Texas (1-0) Stanford (1-1)  Coach Mack Brown said Chris Simms and Major Applewhite, his dueling quarterbacks, will both play.  TV: FSNY, 10:15 p.m.</p>
        <p>No. 9 Washington (2-0) at Colorado (0-2)  Coach Rick Neuheisel of Washington returns to Colorado, which he left after the 1998 season. ''I don't anticipate a lovefest or anything like that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>MISMATCHES  Rutgers (2-0) at No. 8 Virginia Tech (2-0)  It's Michael Vick of Virginia Tech, the most dynamic quarterback in college football, against Mike McMahon, who has 10 touchdown passes in two games. Rutgers returns to reality.  TV: CH7, Noon</p>
        <p>Wake Forest (0-2) at No. 16 Clemson (2-0)  Clemson's 62 points against Missouri were its highest total in 19 years. This game could be more of the same.</p>
        <p>Ball State (0-2) at No. 7 Kansas State (2-0)  Kansas State's patsy of the week sets up the blowout of the week.</p>
