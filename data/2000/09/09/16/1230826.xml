        <p>Bonbons were shaken and God was thanked in Spanish and English when the first Latin Grammy Awards show was broadcast on Wednesday night. It may well have been the most well-meaning awards show in history. It was a harbinger of a 21st century in which a growing Hispanic population will make the United States increasingly bilingual.

        <p>The Latin Grammys provided a rare prime-time network television glimpse beyond the pop star system in the United States, skipping over borders and language barriers.

        <p>Bonbons were shaken and God was thanked in Spanish and English when the first Latin Grammy Awards show was broadcast on Wednesday night. It may well have been the most well-meaning awards show in history. It was a harbinger of a 21st century in which a growing Hispanic population will make the United States increasingly bilingual. And it showed a lot of famous faces and passionate voices that North Americans would never find on MTV.</p>
        <p>The Latin Grammys provided a rare prime-time network television glimpse beyond the pop star system in the United States, skipping over borders and language barriers. (It may also have been the only show for which CBS broadcast national advertising in Spanish with subtitles, something the awards show might consider for songs and scripted speeches next year.)</p>
        <p>According to Nielsen Media Research, the show drew 9 percent of the United States viewing audience, or about 7,469,000 people, compared with 27 percent and 17,443,000 for the Grammy Awards in February. Whatever it lacked in an American audience it probably made up abroad in its broadcast to about 120 countries.</p>
        <p>The Latin Grammys had been in the works for 11 years, Gloria Estefan said on the show. And this was clearly the year to inaugurate them. There was both good news commercially -- Ricky Martin and Marc Anthony breaking through to mainstream pop in the United States, Santana making a pop comeback -- and, after the international attention to the death of Tito Puente, a moment of respect for long-running traditions of Latin dance music and Latin jazz. The first performance on the show, rightly, was a tribute to Mr. Puente sung by Mr. Martin, Ms. Estefan and Celia Cruz fronting a revved-up Latin jazz band.</p>
        <p>With a few million-sellers from Anglo pop as bait -- including 'N Sync, Christina Aguilera, Ms. Estefan and Mr. Martin, all singing in Spanish, along with Carlos Santana -- the Latin Grammys set out to introduce an oblivious American mainstream to the profusion of pop, folk and rock styles in Latin music.</p>
        <p>The awards encompassed Spanish-language performers from Spain as well as the Americas, and included music from Portuguese-speaking Brazil. Along with dopey double-entendre jokes about bongos and timbales, the show's teleprompted speeches tried to offer at least a sound bite's worth of context and to drop a few historic names.</p>
        <p>Latin music is in a different pop universe from the United States, where corporations concentrate on megahits. While Latin music has discovered the multinational marketing power of sappy ballads, video clips and pretty faces, it also has a loyal audience for folky regional styles like Mexican banda (brass-band) music. And it maintains loyal audiences for longtime performers like the Cuban-born salsa belter Ms. Cruz and the earnest Argentine folk and pop singer Mercedes Sosa, who both won awards. The best new artist award winner, the Cuban singer Ibrahim Ferrer from the Buena Vista Social Club, is 73 years old.</p>
        <p>Performers also have different priorities. They are musicians above all, but they also see themselves, with full self-consciousness, as representatives of their countries. Instead of reading the names of managers and record executives, they thanked their backup bands, their fans and their nations. Shakira, a Colombian rock singer who won two awards, dedicated one ''to that country that is going through difficult times right now but that never, never forgets how to smile. This is for you, Colombia.''</p>
        <p>As they allot screen time and awards, the Latin Grammys are likely to face the same diplomatic difficulties that the regular Grammys do.</p>
        <p>There were some obvious disproportions and oddities in the show. For instance, Ms. Aguilera was nominated for a song from her Spanish-language album, which won't be released until next week. And the Latin Grammys will have to decide whether they intend to recognize Latin music as reflected in the United States -- currently Mexican, Brazilian and ''tropical'' (uptempo Caribbean) music have multiple categories -- or internationally. The United States Grammy Awards now include 98 categories; the Latin Grammys have started with 40 and there will doubtless be more. They include tango, samba and flamenco categories, but not vallenato (from Colombia) or fado (from Portugal).</p>
        <p>But the Latin Grammys showed judgment at least as good as their American counterparts, which is not too difficult. Though Mexicans seemed to have an edge on the competition -- Luis Miguel and Mana got multiple awards -- it won't hurt for Anglo visitors at record stores to see that the Grammys recognized Cafe Tacuba's polymorphous rock, Juan Luis Guerra's evolved merengue and Caetano Veloso's latest Brazilian masterpiece, ''Livro.''</p>
        <p>Award choices aside, the chance to hear Ms. Cruz shouting ''Azucar!'' or Djavan, from Brazil, singing in an angelic falsetto, or Shakira linking Colombian salsa to the Middle East, or the guitarist Tomatito playing a volatile flamenco, is something only the Grammy trademark could put on network television. Disputatious as the Latin Grammys are likely to be, they're bound to open some ears.</p>
