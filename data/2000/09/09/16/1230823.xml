        <p>Season-opening programs of musical institutions are a genre unto themselves. A dinner for patrons typically follows, so the concert is, if not necessarily secondary, generally kept short and undemanding.</p>
        <p>Within those limitations the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center has done remarkably well of late. Last year David Shifrin, the society's clarinetist and artistic director, took center stage in a delectable program of Mozart. And on Wednesday evening at Alice Tully Hall, the society's four fine violinists -- Ani Kavafian, Ida Kavafian, Cho-Liang Lin and Joseph Silverstein -- took turns in the spotlight in concertos by Vivaldi and Bach.</p>
        <p>None of which so much as suggested the society's central order of business this season, ''A Great Day in New York,'' a three-week festival of contemporary music, mostly by New York composers, beginning in January. But Vivaldi's hackneyed ''Four Seasons'' took on new life from the sportive competition among the fiddlers, each soloing in turn as the other three formed the second violin section.</p>
        <p>And the juxtaposition of a Vivaldi concerto for two violins (Op. 3, No. 8, featuring Mr. Lin and Mr. Silverstein) with Bach's similar work (BWV 1043, featuring the Kavafian sisters) proved even more of an ear-opener. Bach modeled his concerto style to a large extent on Vivaldi's; as but one example of his study of the Italian master, Bach transcribed that Opus 3 concerto for solo organ. But heard side by side, Vivaldi's and Bach's textures seem diametrically opposed: Vivaldi's especially open and airy, Bach's especially dense with melodic and polyphonic undergrowth.</p>
        <p>The performances were generally excellent, not only from the soloists but also from the little orchestra, anchored by stalwarts like Paul Neubauer, the violist; Fred Sherry, the cellist; and Edgar Meyer, the double bassist. The soloists worked hard to freshen the familiar with embellishments, perhaps too hard.</p>
        <p>Ornamentation at its best, while making the music sparkle and bubble with surprise, seems organic, even inevitable, not intrusive, as it occasionally was here. Still, better this kind of engaged activism than the dull routine so often proffered elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Most important, a season scheduled to become ''great'' in January has taken the necessary first step, becoming good.  MUSIC REVIEW</p>
