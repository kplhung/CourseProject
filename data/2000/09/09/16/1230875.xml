        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman often calls for less vulgarity and meanness in popular culture. But yesterday, Mr. Lieberman appeared on the radio with Don Imus, the raunchy morning-show host, continuing the Democrats' tightrope walk of criticizing the entertainment industry while using it as a source of support.</p>
        <p>The visit to Mr. Imus's studio in Astoria, Queens, was nothing new. Mr. Lieberman had appeared many times before on the nationally syndicated radio show, which is also broadcast on MSNBC, and other politicians like Senator John McCain of Arizona and former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York have been regulars. Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Imus, the acerbic ''shock jock'' who has been accused of offering racist, anti-gay and anti-Semitic fare, clearly are mutual fans.</p>
        <p>But this time, Mr. Lieberman visited not as just a senator from Connecticut, but also as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, at a time when Republicans are accusing him and Vice President Al Gore of hypocrisy in taking entertainment moguls to task while also taking their money. On Thursday night, both candidates attended a fund-raising concert at Radio City Music Hall, organized by entertainment industry leaders, that featured popular acts like Paul Simon, Sheryl Crow and K.D. Lang, singing relatively tame material.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman have threatened to impose a new set of marketing restrictions for violent or sexually explicit films, television shows, music and video games, citing a Federal Trade Commission finding that their makers routinely market them to children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman often laments, as he wrote earlier this year in his book ''In Praise of Public Life,'' ''that much of our culture has become toxic, that our standards of decency and civility are being significantly eroded'' by the popular culture.</p>
        <p>He also speaks often, as he did today at a fund-raiser at the Harvard Club, of ending ethnic prejudice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Imus and his sidekicks, on the other hand, are known, among other things, for derogatory remarks about blacks and gays, and for brutally direct comments about people's sexual behavior and physical appearances. Though Mr. Imus has said that he is neither racist nor anti-gay, he has come under attack by some media critics and by left-leaning publications like The Village Voice.</p>
        <p>''To my recollection, Senator Lieberman has never reprimanded Imus for some of the ridiculous things he says,'' said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Imus himself challenged Mr. Lieberman today about the Thursday night concert.</p>
        <p>''Isn't it fair to suggest that it at least looks hypocritical?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman disagreed, suggesting, as other Democrats have, that he and Mr. Gore had been courageous to criticize an industry that had supported them so reliably.</p>
        <p>''The question is, What do you do when you disagree with people who are your supporters and even friends?'' he said. ''And I think the reason this is not hypocritical is because Al Gore and I spoke out early, quickly and strongly and said the show business people have to stop marketing to kids.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman declined a request for an interview to discuss any qualms he might have about Mr. Imus.</p>
        <p>But at the end of his appearance, he said to his host, ''I hate to say it, but I love you.''</p>
        <p>Kiki McLean, the senator's campaign spokeswoman, said: ''Don Imus has always been respectful to the senator and given him a venue to raise his points of view in front of an audience of millions of people. When you have that opportunity, you can have a dialogue, and that's different than perhaps some hosts, who would not allow that.''</p>
        <p>The tension in the Democrats' position was amply on display on Thursday night, as several of the stars at the concert needled Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman for their views.</p>
        <p>''We had to take time off from our jobs where we push all sorts of sexual and devious material on America's children,'' said John Leguizamo, who then proceeded to make sexually explicit jokes about public figures.</p>
        <p>Bette Midler said, ''Yes, Joe Lieberman is smiling at me now, but just wait until sweeps.''</p>
