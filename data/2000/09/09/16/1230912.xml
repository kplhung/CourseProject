        <p>Nina Behtic, 16, and Sozana Selimaj, 17, are immigrants from the former Yugoslavia. They speak the same language. They go to the same high school. They bear inside of them, usually wrapped in the cotton wool of forgetfulness, the same memories of war and death. But when they grieve, as they did yesterday morning on Cherry Hill in Central Park, they grieve alone.</p>
        <p>''I am a Serb,'' Ms. Behtic said before nodding in the direction of Ms. Selimaj. ''She is Albanian.''</p>

        <p>Nina Behtic, 16, and Sozana Selimaj, 17, are immigrants from the former Yugoslavia. They speak the same language. They go to the same high school. They bear inside of them, usually wrapped in the cotton wool of forgetfulness, the same memories of war and death. But when they grieve, as they did yesterday morning on Cherry Hill in Central Park, they grieve alone.</p>
        <p>''I am a Serb,'' Ms. Behtic said before nodding in the direction of Ms. Selimaj. ''She is Albanian.''</p>
        <p>The thick, close clouds that lowered over the park yesterday let loose a light drizzle as the two young women, among 75 students from Liberty High School on West 18th Street, walked up the asphalt path. At the crest of the hill, around an ornate iron fountain, Doctors Without Borders, the humanitarian aid agency, had arranged a mock refugee camp. Its purpose is to highlight the plight of the 39 million people worldwide that have been uprooted by war, according to figures from the United Nations.</p>
        <p>''First I must tell you that this is not set up for people to have some kind of a vacation,'' said Besnik Dorli, the tour guide for the school group, standing in front of a small thatch shelter.  ''These people had to leave their homes. They cannot walk beyond that fence over there. They cannot go back.''</p>
        <p>The Liberty students, all ninth graders in a special program for new immigrant children at the school, were the first to tour the camp. Doctors Without Borders, which has more than 2,000 volunteers in about 90 countries, has put up similar camps over the last four years in over 100 cities in Europe. This is the first in the United States, and will travel to other sites in the New York area before moving to Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>About 700 schoolchildren and 500 adults visited the camp yesterday. All were guided on 40-minute tours. They were shepherded through 10 different sites, including shelters built for three different climates, a medical clinic, a cholera treatment center, a food distribution area, a water treatment and distribution area, and latrines. Most of the children said they were surprised to see how refugees lived in camps. Many asked how the latrines worked.</p>
        <p>''The children were sad to know that people live in wars like this,'' said Luke Thomas, 37, a tour guide from Liberia. ''They asked a lot of questions about living conditions and what it was like to live in a tent. I would tell them it was very bad to put your family for years in a small tent.''</p>
        <p>At the camp, called ''A Refugee Camp in the Heart of the City,'' visitors were asked to imagine themselves as refugees.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Behtic and Ms. Selimaj, that was not necessary. The white canvas tents and the large posters with pictures of thousands of refugees crammed into fields were unwelcome reminders of the past. They retreated from the group and bowed their heads. The other students stood in an arc around the tent, oblivious to the emotions unleashed within their classmates.</p>
        <p>Ms. Behtic said Muslims driven from their homes occupied her family's house in Sarajevo at the start of the war in April 1992. ''My father was a Muslim,'' said Ms. Behtic, wearing a Serbian Orthodox cross on a gold chain around her neck. ''He left us at the start of the war. He went to Tuzla. He married someone from his own country. We went to Belgrade. He never wanted to see me, to talk to me or to do something for me. I have not seen him for eight years.</p>
        <p>''I cried for my dolls,'' said Ms. Behtic, who camped in the bathroom of an old office building in Belgrade with her mother and grandmother.  ''The only thing I believe in now is God, because I have seen people become animals.''</p>
        <p>She arrived in the United States a year ago for medical treatment. Doctors have found a brain tumor that they say is inoperable. The tumor, which presses against her optic nerve, has left her nearly blind. She and her mother are staying at the Ronald McDonald House but must  return to Belgrade soon because of visa requirements. ''No one wants to accept me,'' she said, ''and I don't want to force them.''</p>
        <p>With words catching in her throat, she inveighed against the Muslims who took her home in Sarajevo, the Muslims who ''robbed Kosovo from the Serbs'' and the Muslims who did not acknowledge her suffering. And as she did, her friend, Ms. Selimaj, listened in stony silence.</p>
        <p>''Do you know how many churches and monasteries were destroyed in Kosovo?'' Ms. Behtic suddenly blurted out to the tour guide.</p>
        <p>''Do not worry about the monasteries,'' said Mr. Dorli, startled. ''A lot of them remain. We can talk about this later.''</p>
        <p>Two of the teachers with the group,  Ursula Walliser, who works with Ms.  Behtic on her vision and who fled East Germany in 1952, and Carol  Yankay, who teaches English as a second language, looked perplexed.  They tried desperately to lighten the tone. They chatted about ice cream and lunch at an Indian restaurant and spoke of trying to forget the past. They hugged the girls as they wept.</p>
        <p>But the two were inconsolable.</p>
        <p>''My cousins were all killed,'' Ms. Selimaj said tersely, moments after her friend's question. ''The Serbs shot dead my best friend.''</p>
        <p>Then Ms. Selimaj, fighting back her own tears, delved into her odyssey, recounting being herded to the train station in Pristina by Serb soldiers, spending four days with no food and collapsing in a white medical tent, ''just like that one,'' at the Macedonian border. She said her family's home had been destroyed.</p>
        <p>''I was in a house when the Serb soldiers came in and started shooting everyone,'' she said. ''I jumped out the window. She has not had such a war like I saw. I was crazy. How can she say that Kosovo is Serbia? The Serbs did the same things in Bosnia. They killed many people. I hate them. I hate them.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Yankay pulled Ms. Selimaj close and said in a low voice:  ''Please, please don't make problems. She does not understand. She is leaving America. She has to go back in a couple of months. You are here.  No one will take this from you. You are here forever.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Behtic, her medical treatment near an end and her departure for Belgrade weeks away, set her eyes about two inches from the guest book at the exit.</p>
        <p>''I am glad that I saw this camp,'' she wrote laboriously in blue ink. ''It was very informative. But I have experienced maybe even worse situations.''</p>
