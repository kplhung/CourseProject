        <p>Ending one of the most embarrassing chapters in its history, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Company has settled litigation with a former analyst whose complaints about his firing led to an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney and a public apology from the firm.</p>
        <p>In a statement yesterday, Christian Curry, a young black man who was fired in 1998 after he posed nude in a magazine for gay men, said he had agreed to drop a discrimination lawsuit. In exchange, Morgan Stanley dropped a countersuit against Mr. Curry.</p>
        <p>It is not clear how much the matter cost the firm. Raymond O'Rourke, a spokesman for the firm, said, ''Christian Curry gets nothing.'' He declined to say whether the firm was paying Mr. Curry's legal bills, which some people close to the case estimated at about $1.5 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Curry said the agreement precluded him from talking about the settlement. His lawyer, Benedict Morelli, did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Rourke said the firm had also settled discrimination lawsuits filed by three other former employees represented by Mr. Morelli. He would not say when they were settled, nor would he discuss the terms. David Granoff, who identified himself as a spokesman for Mr. Morelli, declined to comment on any of the lawsuits.</p>
        <p>In the announcement, Morgan Stanley said it would give the National Urban League $1 million that it could have spent fighting Mr. Curry's lawsuit. But Leslie Dunbar, a spokeswoman for the National Urban League, said that contribution was ''not part of the settlement.''</p>
        <p>Last year, Morgan Stanley admitted it had paid $10,000 to an informant for negative information about Mr. Curry, a disclosure that brought a reprimand from Robert Morgenthau, the district attorney.</p>
        <p>For the last three months, the firm's lawyers have been negotiating with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in an attempt to head off a class-action lawsuit.</p>
        <p>That case stems from a complaint that was made to the commission by Allison K. Schieffelin, who works in stock sales at Morgan Stanley. Ms. Schieffelin contends that she has been denied promotions because she is a woman.</p>
