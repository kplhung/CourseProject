        <p>American depository receipts of Latin America's leading brewery, Companhia de Bebidas das Americas of Brazil, rose 3.3 percent, to $21.6875, in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange, where company officials generated some publicity by ringing the closing bell with the Brazilian model, Gisele Bundchen, and distributing 6,000 cans of the brewery's Guarana Antarctica tropical soft drink to passers-by outside on Wall Street. Ambev, as the company is known, is the world's fourth-largest beer company, a result of a $7 billion merger of Brazil's two largest brewers, Companhia Cervejaria Brahma and Companhia Antarctica Paulista, earlier this year. It controls 70 percent of Brazil's beer market and 25 percent of its soft-drink market.</p>
