        <p>The dull, explosive thud of mortar fire and the roar of MIG-27's are the white noise of this war-weary city. Separatist rebels have advanced to near the outskirts of this, the imagined capital of the Tamil homeland that they have fought, killed and died for. The ethnic conflict that has tormented Sri Lanka for 17 years is once again knocking on Jaffna's door.</p>
        <p>A plaintive, unsigned poster, pasted to walls all over town, asks, ''Can't we stop this madness?'' It seems, as it has for so long, that the answer is a melancholy ''no.''</p>
        <p>In recent months, death has plucked people and other creatures from life here on the Jaffna peninsula with the errant whimsy of a child picking flowers in a garden.</p>
        <p>A young woman riding a bicycle near her home was struck by shrapnel that severed her femoral artery. A cow, lazily chewing its cud, was taken out by a stray shell. A 5-year-old boy, whose grandmother had sent him to the store to buy fruit juice, was struck in the spine by shrapnel from a shell that had crashed into a drumstick tree. Two people died when incoming fire hit a home for elderly residents.</p>
        <p>The Sri Lankan security forces and the rebels are now locked in a military stalemate for control of Jaffna, a city of 150,000, and the small peninsula upon which it sits at the northern tip of this island nation. Sri Lanka has been torn apart by civil war as the Tamil Tigers have fought for a separate nation in the north and east, areas the Tamils regard as their traditional homelands.</p>
        <p>In April, people here believed the flag of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam would soon be flying over Jaffna, as it had before the government retook the city in 1995. But the military stopped the rebels just short of the city. And on the first weekend of September, the army opened an earsplitting offensive to push the Tigers back farther. It produced some gains at a heavy cost in lives. Pounded by mortar and artillery fire as they ran across open, scrubby terrain, more than 100 soldiers were killed and more than 400 wounded. Many rebels were also killed.</p>
        <p>Both sides are armed with increasingly devastating weaponry. Humiliated by a string of defeats at the hands of the rebels, Sri Lanka has spent more than $360 million on military hardware in just the last four months, a stunning sum for a country of only 19 million people with a per capita income of just $810 a year.</p>
        <p>A third of the peninsula's 470,000 residents have been forced to leave their homes since last spring as a direct result of the fighting, according to international relief organizations.</p>
        <p>But their suffering has been muted to the rest of Sri Lanka. The government has imposed strict censorship on military news and has not allowed any Sri Lankan journalists to venture to the Jaffna peninsula since January.</p>
        <p>Recently, though, the army has begun allowing a few foreign correspondents to roam Jaffna and its environs unfettered by minders.</p>
        <p>Residents are trying to maintain a semblance of normalcy in a city that could be engulfed by war at any time. Locals have to be off the streets by 7 p.m. under the curfew. One morning, children in blue shorts and white shirts walked to school. A woman in a flowing dress sat perched on a bicycle, daintily holding a parasol in one hand as she steered around a tank that lumbered through a narrow lane. Homemakers shopped in thatched-roof shops where steel pots, straw baskets and stalks of bananas dangled from the ceiling.</p>
        <p>But beneath the surface, there is fear among people like Sarojini Sri Somasegaram, a bank stenographer who came to the ornate Nallur temple to join Friday morning worshipers offering buttercup and hibiscus blossoms at a shrine to Lord Shiva's son. She said the shells were falling just a quarter mile from her home.</p>
        <p>Like most residents of Jaffna, she is an ethnic Tamil and a Hindu. She feels discriminated against by the country's majority, which is ethnically Sinhalese and Buddhist.</p>
        <p>''We are going for work, but always in tension,'' she said. ''Anytime, shelling or bombing comes from all directions. We are frightened, but what are we to do?''</p>
        <p>She has stayed put in her home, but many people have sought shelter in high-ceiling Roman Catholic schools, refugee camps and the homes of family and friends. Farmers are cut off from their land, fisherman from the sea -- and reduced to surviving on dry rations from the government.</p>
        <p>Janita Irene, 28, her husband and her three daughters, ages 8, 5 and 3, sleep at night on the cement floor of St. Patrick's College in Jaffna with 45 other families. Her husband used to make a good living catching prawns, cuttlefish, crab and shark, but he now earns little more than $1 a day in a tea shop.</p>
        <p>''We used to be rich,'' she said wistfully.</p>
        <p>Just outside the city, 30 families live in a small refugee camp built with financial help from the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. The huts are made of coconut fronds, mud, dung, plastic sheeting, twine and sugar sacks.</p>
        <p>Anthonyquinn Sril, 31, said he was napping on a bench in the sun at his home east of Jaffna in May when shrapnel struck him under the arm and in the hip. He staggered up only to discover that his 6-year-old nephew, playing in the yard, had been killed by a shell.</p>
        <p>Like most refugees on the peninsula, he did not move to the Wanni, a Tiger-controlled area in the northern part of the mainland. Though he is Tamil, he feels safer here near Jaffna in an area controlled by Sinhalese troops of the army.</p>
        <p>''We don't want to live in war places,'' he said. ''We want to live in a peace place.''</p>
        <p>The University Teachers for Human Rights in Jaffna, a Tamil rights organization, said in a bulletin issued this month that Tamil refugees had been voting with their feet for the army over the Tigers, also known as the L.T.T.E.</p>
        <p>''After listening to propaganda speeches, the L.T.T.E. cadre had come there expecting the people to be grateful for being liberated,'' the group wrote. ''It came as a shock to them to find that the people were trying all available ruses to get away from them.''</p>
        <p>But while Tamils may vote with their feet for the army, it is doubtful that they will vote for Tamil parties that back the current government when parliamentary elections are held on Oct. 10.</p>
        <p>Tamil disillusionment with the governing coalition, headed by President Chandrika Kumaratunga, runs deep. In her six years in office, she has not been able to deliver what they yearn for most: peace.</p>
        <p>Jaffna is now plastered with political posters, but an eerie quiet has settled over the campaigning here. Many candidates are afraid to speak out -- afraid for their lives. Through the years, the Tigers have systematically killed rivals for the loyalty of the Tamil people in their crusade for a Tamil homeland in the country's north and east.</p>
        <p>Democratically elected Tamils have been particularly vulnerable. In 1998, the Tigers assassinated two mayors of Jaffna -- a man, and then his wife, who succeeded him. Both were members of the Tamil United Liberation Front, a party committed to a nonviolent, political settlement of the country's ethnic problem. The party decided not to replace its slain mayors. The city now has none.</p>
        <p>At the party's headquarters here, tucked behind an armed police guard and a row of rusty barrels, V. Anandasangaree, a parliamentary candidate, said his greatest fear now was of violence not from the Tigers but from other thuggish Tamil groups who are former militants now backed by the government.</p>
        <p>He has no plans to do what politicians normally do: speak at rallies and press the flesh at public functions. Instead, he will run what he called ''almost a silent campaign.''</p>
        <p>Some here still expect the Tigers' hit squads to go into action soon. ''We don't know when they'll start killing the candidates,'' said the Rev. J. Fernando, an English teacher at St. Patrick's. ''Wait and see.''</p>
        <p>The tragedy of Jaffna, once the vibrant heart of erudition and culture for the Tamil people, is written in the blasted ruins of some of its greatest institutions. They are a ghostly, open-air museum of war.</p>
        <p>The stately library is a gutted hulk, its thousands of volumes up in smoke and its dome cracked open like an eggshell. There is nothing left of the grand old post office but a bullet-pocked facade. Blue sky and wheeling birds are visible through the gaping holes that used to be windows. All that remains of the city's museum is a single stone wall in a weedy, overgrown park.</p>
        <p>But it is not only the Tamils who have suffered here in the battle zones of northern Sri Lanka, but also the young Sinhalese soldiers, most of them from poor, rural backgrounds, who have died by the thousands in recent years.</p>
        <p>Some in the Sri Lankan security forces have committed human rights violations. About 500 people disappeared from the Jaffna area in 1996, and the army is believed to have slain many of them. But few people interviewed here seemed to hate the troops, whom they described as generally polite.</p>
        <p>Soldiers with machine guns slung over their shoulders shopped for manioc, onions and potatoes at a vegetable market a few miles from Jaffna one recent afternoon.</p>
        <p>''The soldiers are very friendly,'' said S. Tharamaratam, a vegetable seller. ''They pay the money honestly.''</p>
        <p>Vijaratne Vasanta, a 28-year-old soldier with a wife and 3-year-old son at home in his village, said he was fighting to keep the country united. ''We Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese are all Sri Lankans,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At the Palali air force base here on the peninsula today, soldiers snapped smartly to attention and saluted as stretcher-bearers passed by, carrying two dead comrades in white plastic bags. The bodies were loaded onto a dank troop carrier for the hourlong flight to Colombo, the capital.</p>
        <p>Soldiers, some of them bandaged and hobbling on crutches, sat on benches that ran the length of the plane with the body bags laid out on the floor between them. The grinding roar of the engines made conversation impossible, so the men sat in silence, napping and looking out the windows or at the ceiling -- anywhere but at the fallen men who lay at their feet.</p>
