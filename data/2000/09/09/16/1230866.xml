        <p>As a 5-year-old, he survived an accident in which a trailer full of hay thumped onto him. Last year, Crohn's disease gnawed 20 pounds off his frame. After spring practice, he was the third choice to quarterback the Tennessee Volunteers. Two weeks ago, in the season opener, he had made it to the second team.</p>
        <p>A. J. Suggs knows about calamity. It has taught him patience. And Saturday, when the No. 11 Volunteers take the field against No. 6 Florida, the red-shirt freshman will need the latter to avoid the former in his first collegiate start.</p>
        <p>''Being a young QB, I have to try not to make so many big plays,'' Suggs said. ''That's what I am trying to learn, that we have too many gifted and talented athletes for me to try and force things.''</p>
        <p>How Suggs inherited the starting position says much about the fits and starts Coach Phillip Fulmer is experiencing as he tries to develop a young team into a Southeastern Conference contender. Nine true freshmen played significant downs in a 19-16 victory over Southern Mississippi -- including right tackle Michael Munoz, the son of Hall of Famer Anthony Munoz. The younger Munoz became the first freshman to start on the offensive line since Bill Mayo in 1981.</p>
        <p>With the departure of Tee Martin, the Volunteers anticipated a muddled quarterback situation and got it. A sore shoulder has thwarted the development of the highly touted freshman Casey Clausen.</p>
        <p>The sophomore Joey Mathews was ineffective as the starter against Southern Miss, then injured his knee in practice.</p>
        <p>Enter Suggs. He completed 4 of 9 attempts for 75 yards and a touchdown in part-time duty in the opener and impressed the coaching staff with his command of the team.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't that A. J. did that much better or that Joey did anything that badly,'' the offensive coordinator Randy Sanders said. ''We just thought A. J. changed the tempo. He brings a little something to us moving around that Joey doesn't have.''</p>
        <p>As a high school freshman, Suggs took the starting job away from the senior captain and went on to lead McEachern High School in Powder Springs, Ga., to a 46-7 record, including a 14-1 mark and a trip to the state championship game in 1998.</p>
        <p>He was intent on going to Tennessee and did not waver when Chris Simms, the nation's most-heralded high school quarterback, decided that he, too, wanted to be a Volunteer. Eventually, Simms chose Texas. So last year, Suggs roomed with Martin, dissected film with the two-year starter and tried to become the most knowledgeable quarterback on the depth chart.</p>
        <p>By October, however, the 6-foot-4-inch Suggs began to suffer piercing stomach pains, rapid weight loss and a stiffening in his throwing hand. It was Crohn's disease, an inflammation of the lower intestine, and most thought it would end his career. It did not -- medication eased the symptoms, and countless hours in the weight room built his body back up.</p>
        <p>Still, he was the odd man out at spring practice.</p>
        <p>''With everything I've gone through, overcoming all these obstacles has really helped me grow as a person,'' he said. ''I feel that if I go out and work hard it doesn't matter who they bring in.''</p>
        <p>This balance and leadership did not go unnoticed by his teammates. He got a visit from Martin, now with the Pittsburgh Steelers, this week, and running back Travis Henry said they were comfortable with a novice quarterback heading into a game against a team that has beaten them six of the last seven meetings.</p>
        <p>''We need to come off the ball and run the football,'' said Henry, who had 135 yards in the opener. ''We'll run some short routes for A. J. to get his confidence up. But here's no doubt on my mind, he can take over the football game. He don't have to win the football game. He don't have to be the hero.''</p>
        <p>Last summer, Suggs began watching the tape of the Gators' 23-21 victory. He had no idea whether he would be the starter or not, but he wanted to be ready.</p>
        <p>''All I've ever wanted was an opportunity, and now it's up to me to take advantage of it,'' he said. ''I've been through a lot, I know. But, hey, I'm still here.''</p>
