        <p>Judges in Chicago and California delivered opposite rulings today on suits in which cities had sued the gun industry.</p>
        <p>In Chicago, one of the first cities to file such a suit, a judge dismissed the claim that gun makers and retailers should be held responsible for the costs associated with gun violence.</p>
        <p>In California, by contrast, Judge Vincent P. DiFiglia of San Diego Superior Court rejected a gun industry motion to dismiss a group of lawsuits filed by 12 cities and counties, including Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley.</p>
        <p>The rulings reflect the disparate approaches that courts are taking in the spate of gun industry lawsuits filed by cities in the past two years. Lawyers involved in the suits say the clashing rulings suggest that the issue of whether cities can sue will have to be resolved by higher courts.</p>
        <p>Judges in Cincinnati, Miami and Bridgeport, Conn., have dismissed lawsuits similar to Chicago's. But the courts have so far allowed cases in Detroit, Atlanta, Boston, New Orleans and Cleveland to go forward.</p>
        <p>The ruling in the California case encompasses the largest jurisdiction so far -- the cities and counties that are suing represent more than half the population of the state. The California lawsuits accuse the industry of creating a public nuisance by providing weapons to disreputable or lax dealers, knowing that the dealers would probably sell guns to criminals. The suits also charge that the industry has violated the California business-practices law, which prohibits ''unlawful, unfair and deceptive business acts and practices.''</p>
        <p>''The gun companies have been trying to knock us out of court, but the judge said no,'' said Louise H. Renne, the San Francisco city attorney.</p>
        <p>The Chicago lawsuit, which sought $433 million, accused 42 gun manufacturers, distributors and dealers of negligence and of creating a public nuisance. The city claimed that like companies that pollute or bars that serve alcohol to minors, the gun industry should be held liable and reimburse the city for police, medical and other costs of gun injuries.</p>
        <p>In granting the industry's motion to dismiss, Judge Stephen A. Schiller of Cook County Circuit Court suggested that the city had not shown wrongdoing by the individual defendants. He said that the city's arguments would be better handled in a legislature than in a courtroom.</p>
        <p>At a news conference today, Mayor Richard M. Daley, holding up a Tec-9 semiautomatic gun, said the city would appeal the judge's ruling.  ''We think our chances of winning an appeal are good because the evidence on our side is indisputable,'' he said.</p>
        <p>James Valentino, a lawyer who represents one of the Chicago defendants, Universal Firearms Ltd., which operates Bell's Gun and Sport Shop in Franklin Park, Ill., said he was confident the city would lose an appeal.</p>
        <p>''This is not a case where an individual that has been injured is suing the person who sold the gun to the person who injured him,'' Mr. Valentino said. ''This is the City of Chicago trying to collect $400 million for governmental services in treating injuries, which it is obligated to provide anyway, from manufacturers, suppliers and dealers of a product.''</p>
        <p>Chicago had refiled its suit in March after the judge dismissed the negligence claim and deferred ruling on the public nuisance claim. In the amended suit, the city provided statistics that city officials said showed that only a small percentage of distributors and dealers sold the guns that were used in crimes in Chicago.</p>
        <p>''They've known for all these years that only a very small number of wholesalers supply the crime market, and yet they continue to use these same distribution channels,'' said Lawrence Rosenthal, deputy corporation counsel for the city. ''The industry knows that an important market niche is the crime market, and they continue to supply guns to it, even through channels that they can easily identify as being the source of those crimes.''</p>
