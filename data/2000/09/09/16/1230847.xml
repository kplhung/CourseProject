        <p>It has been a bittersweet week for Australia's other Olympic city. While Sydney was dressing itself up for the opening ceremony of the Summer Games and basking in the world's attention, Melbourne, which played host to Australia's first Olympics, in 1956, watched from the sideline.</p>
        <p>Actually, it was worse than that. Hoping to steal a bit of the Olympic spotlight, Melbourne was the host for a high-profile conference organized by the World Economic Forum the week before the Games began. But the meeting, called the Business Olympics, was almost scuttled by thousands of demonstrators who tried to blockade the hotel where it was held, clashing with riot police.</p>
        <p>The violence left 30 protesters hospitalized and raised accusations of police brutality. Televised images of police officers swinging their truncheons were a dark contrast to the sunny atmosphere in Sydney.</p>
        <p>''We were known for hosting the 'friendly games,' '' said Bryan Oehm, 59, a native of Melbourne, who remembers going to the 1956 Olympics as a teenager. ''This kind of violence is not what Melbourne is about. It is un-Australian. We're very concerned that this is going to tarnish our name.''</p>
        <p>Melbourne cheered itself up on Wednesday night with the opening men's Olympic soccer match at the Cricket Grounds, home of the 1956 Games. More than 90,000 fans turned out to cheer Australia, which was defeated by Italy, 1-0. The evening even featured a lavish opening ceremony that led some people to suggest that Melbourne, not Sydney, had opened the 2000 Games.</p>
        <p>Like many people here, Oehm is ambivalent about Sydney's playing host to the Games. He is thrilled that Australia is getting another shot at the Olympics. But he is nostalgic about Melbourne's two weeks of glory, which now exist only in memory and faded newsreel footage. Those feelings are compounded by the fact that Melbourne bid for the 1996 Olympics, losing out to Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''We really thought we had a strong chance to win,'' said Oehm, who is a gatekeeper at the Cricket Grounds.</p>
        <p>While people here do not begrudge Sydney its success, there are lingering suspicions that the Australian Olympic Committee did not push as hard for Melbourne as for Sydney. The committee had been sharply divided about whether to choose Melbourne or Sydney as its candidate for 1996. Though Melbourne prevailed, some Australian officials were said to be less than enthusiastic.</p>
        <p>Though similar in size, Melbourne and Sydney are notably different in style and atmosphere. While Sydney is brash and outdoorsy, Melbourne is more reserved and cultural. With its theaters and museums, Melbourne feels like a European capital. Sydney, on the other hand, is indisputably a Pacific Rim city, with the requisite spectacular harbor and sandy beaches.</p>
        <p>Melbourne was Australia's capital until 1908, when the government decided to build a new capital in Canberra. And Melbourne has preserved its status as a commercial hub, home to the Australian stock exchange. But few people here argue that Sydney has supplanted Melbourne as the country's most cosmopolitan city.</p>
        <p>''The perception that Sydney has overtaken Melbourne is definitely there,'' said Megan Davies, 23, who was selling Olympic memorabilia at the Cricket Grounds during the soccer match. ''Whether it is true, I'm not sure.''</p>
        <p>One area where Melbourne refuses to play second fiddle to Sydney is sports. It was the first city in the Southern Hemisphere to be host for an Olympics. And it came up with some of the finest traditions of the modern Games, including the practice of having athletes of all countries mingle in the closing ceremony.</p>
        <p>Even today, Melbourne claims most of the country's major sporting events, including the Australian Open in tennis, the Melbourne Grand Prix and the championship of Australian Rules Football.</p>
        <p>But not being the host for the biggest event of all still rankles, even if the stubbornly cheerful residents of Melbourne are loath to admit it.</p>
        <p>A popular television and radio commercial broadcast here this week has the chairman of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, announcing the winner of the 2000 Games. When Samaranch comes to the word ''Sydney,'' a voice-over cries, ''Melbourne!'' and the crowd erupts in cheers.</p>
        <p>''The ad taps into some deep feelings here,'' said Denis Maher, the curatorial assistant of Melbourne's well-tended Olympic Museum. ''It finally sates our need to win an Olympic Games.''</p>
