        <p>The 27th Summer Games opened tonight with a spirit of inclusiveness and reconciliation in a ceremony that addressed Australia's discriminatory treatment of its indigenous people, celebrated the unprecedented number of female Olympians and applauded a march of unity between North Korea and South Korea.</p>
        <p>The four-and-a-half-hour ceremony also included plenty of whimsy as the Italian team entered dressed in the colors of crayons; the Japanese wore tie-dyed capes; a self-parodying parade of lawn mowers symbolized the suburban Australian dream; and a dreamlike underwater sequence conjured Jules Verne on hallucinogens.</p>
        <p>Yet the most symbolic and pointed moment occurred when the Aboriginal sprinter Cathy Freeman, a gold-medal favorite in the 400 meters, was chosen to light the Olympic caldron, which lifted a ring of fire from a pool of water and ascended to the top of Olympic Stadium.</p>
        <p>Freeman's achievement and visibility on the track have brought increased international attention to the plight of the Aborigines at these Sydney Games. Two months ago, she rebuked the government of Prime Minister John Howard as insensitive for its refusal to apologize for generations of racist behavior toward Australia's indigenous people, who date back 50,000 years and who have been marginalized during two centuries of white settlement.</p>
        <p>In July, Freeman revealed that her grandmother had been part of the so-called stolen generation of primarily mixed-race Aboriginal children who were taken from their families between 1910 and 1970 to be assimilated into the white culture. Her grandmother did not know her own true age or birth date, said Freeman, who won a silver medal in the 400 at the Atlanta Olympics and is a two-time world champion in that event.</p>
        <p>Over the past decade, equitable restitution for the Aborigines has become Australia's most divisive social and political issue. Tonight's opening ceremony is likely to stir the debate further and increase pressure on Mr. Howard to issue a formal apology.</p>
        <p>Mr. Howard, the conservative prime minister, was among the 110,000 people in Olympic Stadium tonight as Freeman lighted the Olympic caldron. A particularly unflinching reference to the massacre of Aborigines occurred during a portion of the ceremony dedicated to the songs, customs and dances of indigenous people as an Aboriginal performer walked warily away from a ship signifying the arrival of European settlers in the late 1700's.</p>
        <p>''I would like to express our respect to those who have made Australia what it is today, a great country, with a special tribute to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,'' said Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee in his speech to open the Games.</p>
        <p>Except for the grand parade of 628 Australian athletes, who tossed toy kangaroos into the cheering crowd, the loudest applause was for the Koreans as they marched together for the first time, arms raised, hand in hand, wearing blue blazers and khaki pants.</p>
        <p>A coach from North Korea and an athlete from South Korea led the delegation; together they held aloft the white flag bearing a blue shape of the peninsula, undivided on this evening, North and South indistinguishable. As the crowd rose to its feet, even some members of the news media applauded the unified entrance of these two bitterly partitioned nations.</p>
        <p>''We have had some families reunited and some cultural exchanges, but this is the most visible symbol of the desire for unification,'' said Kim Un Yong, a powerful member of the International Olympic Committee from South Korea.</p>
        <p>About 60 of the 200 nations in tonight's ceremony were led by female flag bearers, a reflection of the fact that a record 42 percent of the 10,500 athletes in these Games are women. Among the flag bearers were three Olympic champions -- the runner Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia, the first black African woman to win a gold medal; the heptathlete Ghada Shouaa of Syria, the first Middle Eastern woman to win a gold medal; and the hurdler Deon Hemmings of Jamaica.</p>
        <p>Women are expected to be among the biggest stars of these Games. The American sprinter Marion Jones is attempting to become the first woman to win five gold medals in track and field during one Olympics. The women's marathon features the world record-holder Tegla Loroupe of Kenya and the defending champion Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia. And the celebrated American women's soccer team is attempting to win its second gold medal.</p>
        <p>Other notable athletes include 17-year-old Ian Thorpe of Australia, who is trying to live up to his countrymen's expectations by winning three swimming golds, and the Russian Aleksandr Karelin, who is attempting to win his fourth wrestling title.</p>
        <p>But tonight belonged to Australia's athletic heroines, past and present.</p>
        <p>The Olympic torch was brought into the stadium tonight by the great Australian sprinter Betty Cuthbert, who won four gold medals in track and field from 1956 through 1964 and now must use a wheelchair because of multiple sclerosis. Four other female Australian sports legends helped carry the torch around the track until it was handed to Freeman, who was dressed in a white-and-silver unitard.</p>
        <p>The public-address announcer prematurely ended the national suspense over this portion of the ceremony by announcing Freeman's name before the torch reached her. She ran up a small flight of stairs, walked through a pool of water, reached down and lighted a circle of flame, which rose around her on the Olympic caldron.</p>
        <p>A minor glitch occurred as the caldron wobbled and did not ascend a ramp to the top of the stadium for nearly five minutes, but the torch lighting carried a certain dignity and solemnity that drew the strobe-like flash of thousands of cameras.</p>
        <p>Carrying the flag for the 623-athlete United States delegation was Cliff Meidl from Redondo Beach, Calif., who has become a familiar Olympic story of great perseverance after surviving a near-crippling accident 14 years ago to become an Olympic kayaker.</p>
        <p>As a 20-year-old, Meidl was operating a jackhammer when he struck a power line. The shock of 30,000 volts blew off several toes, damaged his skull, burned his back and left his legs in danger of amputation. Doctors harvested muscle from his calves and attached them to his knees. He spent the next three years on crutches and took up paddling because it requires primarily upper-body strength. This is his second Olympics.</p>
        <p>''I was very upset; a lot of times, I'd ask myself, 'Why did this happen to me?' '' Meidl said. ''I found out that is not the way to deal with things. It's better to look at things in a positive light and move forward. I made a motto for myself -- to maximize myself as an individual.''</p>
