        <p>Sydney used soldiers to help transport some of the 114,000 people who attended the Olympic Games opening ceremony Friday.</p>
        <p>Most spectators arrived and left without problems in the first real test of Summer Games logistics in this sprawling city of 4 million. Trains handled 90,000 people Friday night and buses carried 24,000 more. Officials said most lines were cleared within 90 minutes of the ceremony's 11:30 p.m. close.</p>

        <p>Sydney used soldiers to help transport some of the 114,000 people who attended the Olympic Games opening ceremony Friday.</p>
        <p>Most spectators arrived and left without problems in the first real test of Summer Games logistics in this sprawling city of 4 million. Trains handled 90,000 people Friday night and buses carried 24,000 more. Officials said most lines were cleared within 90 minutes of the ceremony's 11:30 p.m. close.</p>
        <p>After a week of bureaucratic and political bickering about wayward bus service, the 3,500-vehicle fleet was on schedule. The drivers included about 20 members of the army, part of a group of 100 that has been posted to Olympic duty because experienced civilian drivers have been scarce.</p>
        <p>Also at the wheel were 100 drivers from rural outposts who had quit their new behind-the-wheel jobs last week but were lured back with pay bonuses.</p>
        <p>For the most part, the four-hour opening pageant had a military precision, from a 2,000-strong marching band to 8,000 other entertainers who hit their marks and cues.</p>
        <p>But over all, the big show ran an hour late because the 200 national squads paraded slowly. Only the V.I.P.'s, including Bill Gates, who waved a paper United States flag, Muhammad Ali and Princess Anne were allowed automobile rides to the 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium. Minimal parking and anti-pollution policies limit the number of cars there.</p>
