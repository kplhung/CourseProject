        <p>A month ago, three Roman Catholic bishops from the United States embarked on a fact-finding journey through the Great Lakes region of eastern and central Africa, an area that for several years has seemed to produce only bad news.</p>

        <p>A month ago, three Roman Catholic bishops from the United States embarked on a fact-finding journey through the Great Lakes region of eastern and central Africa, an area that for several years has seemed to produce only bad news.</p>
        <p>Their purpose was to assess the situation of refugees displaced by civil war and regional conflict in Rwanda, Burundi and Congo. There may be as many as two million of these people, some of them children living in vast camps without adult relatives.</p>
        <p>Since their return to the United States about two weeks ago, the bishops have begun calling greater attention to the refugees, for the sake of persuading government policy makers and the public that much more can be done to help.</p>
        <p>''This seems to be like a very large region of the world that people are willing to let fall off the map,'' said Thomas G. Wenski, auxiliary bishop of Miami, one of those who made the journey. ''We talk about globalization, and the Great Lakes region of Africa seems to be written out of the equation.''</p>
        <p>Speaking in an interview on Thursday, Bishop Wenski paraphrased a statement of Pope John Paul II that globalization ought to mean solidarity with other human beings, and added, ''Solidarity means no one left behind.''</p>
        <p>Bishop Wenski was accompanied on the two-week trip by Bishop Phillip F. Straling of Reno, Nev., and Bishop Donald E. Pelotte of Gallup, N.M., a board member of Catholic Relief Services, which aids people overseas. Four officials who work with refugees for the Vatican or the United States Catholic Conference also made the journey.</p>
        <p>''The delegation was split up at times, and not everybody was at every camp,'' Bishop Wenski said. But in all, the bishops and their support staff visited refugee camps in five countries. One camp, Kukama, in Kenya, is home to about 5,000 unaccompanied children, among many other people.</p>
        <p>A report on the bishops' journey is being prepared, but in the meantime they have issued recommendations, among them that concerted international efforts be made to bring peace to the region; that Congress increase, to at least $700 million, refugee assistance to the area in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1; and that the United States and other nations increase the number of African refugees they will themselves admit. (It is to the United States' credit, the bishops say, that it has accepted as many as 18,000 African refugees this year, up from 7,000 in 1998.)</p>
        <p>''By having bishops travel to the region, you raise the profile of the area,'' Bishop Wenski said hopefully.</p>
        <p>''Each place we visited, the local bishops were very appreciative of our coming,'' he said. ''When we got to Burundi, the bishop said, 'Nobody comes here, because it is so dangerous.' ''</p>
        <p>Another prelate, he recalled, quoted an African proverb to the effect that you know who your true friends are because they come to you when you are endangered.</p>
        <p>U.S.-Cuba Exchanges</p>
        <p>In another statement resulting from an overseas trip, the National Council of Churches said it would work with its counterpart in Cuba to establish a fund financing exchanges between citizens of Cuba and the United States.</p>
        <p>The plan was included in a joint declaration signed by the heads of the National Council, the Rev. Robert Edgar, and the Cuban Council of Churches, the Rev. Reinerio Arce Valentin, on Sept. 6.</p>
        <p>The declaration concluded a six-day visit to Cuba by a National Council delegation that visited Protestant churches there as well as Cuba's main Protestant theological seminary, in the city of Matanzas, some 60 miles east of Havana. The delegation also met with Havana's Roman Catholic cardinal, Jaime Ortega.</p>
        <p>According to a report by the National Council, the number of people attending worship services in Cuba has risen in recent years with the government's gradual relaxation of restrictions on religious life (a process aided by the pope's visit two years ago). A research center affiliated with the Cuban church council reports that about 300,000 Protestants attend worship services regularly, as do about 280,000 Catholics. The combined numbers are about 5 percent of Cuba's population of more than 11 million.</p>
