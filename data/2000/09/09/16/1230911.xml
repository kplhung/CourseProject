        <p>Spurred by a booming real estate market, some philanthropies, universities and other nonprofit groups have in recent years made land deals that critics say harm the environment and contradict the institutions' missions.</p>
        <p>The deals have generally involved woodlands or other undeveloped parcels that were either donated or part of an institution's original endowment. The sellers range from foundations with billions of dollars in assets to Boy Scout councils that want to sell campgrounds to raise money.</p>
        <p>Many deals have led to controversy in communities trying to fight sprawl and preserve open space. But trustees of the institutions say their bylaws require them to earn the biggest return on any investment, be it land or stocks.</p>
        <p>''Do you make a financial sacrifice for local environmental reasons and then make it less easy to make grants for worthy causes, including important environmental causes elsewhere?'' asked Murray Gell-Mann, a physicist and Nobel Prize winner on the board of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. ''It's a very tricky question.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the MacArthur Foundation -- the Chicago dispenser of ''genius'' grants and a longtime supporter of ''smart growth'' in Florida -- sold 15,000 wooded acres in that state to a developer for $220 million.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Rockefeller University, a leader in environmental research, sold a 213-acre estate abutting a preserve and reservoir in suburbs north of New York City for $7.9 million to the developer Donald J. Trump, who  plans to move 130,000 tons of earth to turn the property into a country club.</p>
        <p>In 1997, the S. H. Cowell Foundation, a San Francisco philanthopy with a focus on social programs and parks, proposed building 5,200 homes and an office park on Cowell Ranch, 4,400 acres of pasture and orchards it owns amid the traffic-choked sprawl east of San Francisco Bay.</p>
        <p>Affected communities and conservation groups generally credit the MacArthur and Cowell foundations, among others, with doing much to serve communities. But some ethicists say that because such institutions generally receive tax breaks, they should be more accountable.</p>
        <p>''People are not thinking in a wide enough context of values and responsibilities,'' said Strachan Donnelly, director of the humans and nature program at the Hastings Center, an ethics research center in Garrison, N.Y. He said the scope of the problem was unclear because the environmental issues rarely resonated beyond the specific communities where properties were located.</p>
        <p>''Supporting smart growth and spurring growth -- I can see how it would be seen as ironic,'' said Woodward A. Wickham, a vice president of the MacArthur Foundation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wickham insisted that the greater good had been served. He noted that the foundation, which once owned 100,000 acres in Florida, had donated or sold some 30,000 acres to local governments or conservation groups for parks, preserves and water management. Critics say, though, that the preserved lands -- mostly swamp -- would have been impossible to build on anyway.</p>
        <p>The buyer of MacArthur's Florida land, Watermark Communities Inc., quickly sold most of it to builders who plan golf courses, polo clubs, office parks and gated communities. Stirring more criticism, MacArthur, as part of its deal, gained a 17 percent stake in Watermark.</p>
        <p>Some local environmental officials say the foundation, while seeking to protect global biodiversity, should not be bulldozing eastern Florida's native vegetation.</p>
        <p>The other big land deals are moving ahead, though greatly modified after community pressure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trump's Seven Springs Golf Club, converting the lands bought from Rockefeller University that straddle three Westchester County towns, is close to final approvals. He dropped plans for professional tournaments and luxury homes.</p>
        <p>And last week, the Cowell Foundation, facing local officials' threats to reject its project, accepted a deal to sell 90 percent of the Cowell Ranch to a preservation group.</p>
        <p>For some, the issue is not only environmental ethics, but also fairness to communities. Michael W. Klemens, a biologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society who is also chairman of the planning commission in Rye, another Westchester town, began considering the issue three years ago.</p>
        <p>That was when the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Research Institute sold a Rye campus, with 41 park-like acres, to a company that has built 38 large houses, commanding prices up to $1.5 million, on the property.</p>
        <p>The parcel, most of which Sloan-Kettering never paid taxes on, abutted preserves. ''I'm not against profits,'' Dr. Klemens said. ''I'm against seeing significant tracts of open space disappear without a discussion of these issues. All those years they got a free ride at our expense. They owe something back.''</p>
        <p>Generally, nonprofit groups with large land holdings did not seek to get into the real estate business.</p>
        <p>The Cowell Foundation was created in 1956 from the estate of Samuel Henry Cowell, who built a fortune in timber and cement and accumulated 73,000 acres of California lands.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the foundation shed 90 percent of the land, sometimes for income and sometimes for other purposes; for example, it sold 2,000 acres to the state that now makes up the campus of the University of California at Santa Cruz.</p>
        <p>When John D. MacArthur, who built his fortune in the insurance industry, died in 1978, almost all his assets went to the foundation bearing his and his wife's names. Because he largely invested in real estate, including vast tracts in Florida, the foundation held a portfolio skewed toward land, which is hard to manage and comes with costs. (The MacArthur and Cowell lands were not exempt from taxes; that occurs only when the land is the base of an organization's operations, as was the case with Sloan-Kettering.)</p>
        <p>Because the Internal Revenue Service forbids nonprofit groups from being majority owners of a business, pressure grew on the foundation to sell. Since 1985, when real estate constituted 41 percent of its $2.1 billion in assets, or $861 million, the MacArthur Foundation pruned its holdings. By 1998, real estate accounted for just 4 percent of $4.1 billion in assets, or $164 million.</p>
        <p>In the process, the foundation became one of Florida's biggest players in the development boom that has eaten into the wetlands and woods along Interstate 95.</p>
        <p>Some lands with unusual species or important water supplies were set aside or sold to local governments or agencies; even then, profit was foremost, MacArthur employees said.</p>
        <p>In the last couple of years, some board members said, they paid less attention to the deals, assuming that the distasteful task was largely done. ''On the whole, we escaped with our consciences intact,'' one said.</p>
        <p>By 1998, though, the land the foundation still owned was the last open space for miles around. Even then, MacArthur officials contend, they did the right thing -- selling about 17,000 acres of unbuildable land to Palm Beach County and water-management agencies for $17.5 million. Thus, they said, they had every right to sell the last 15,000 acres of developable lands last year to Watermark.</p>
        <p>Watermark has sold a few tracts  to Palm Beach County. But the price, county officials said, was much higher than it would have been had the foundation sold the environmentally significant parcels first.</p>
        <p>Some land Watermark owns still hangs in the balance. One tract of 4,478 acres straddling Palm Beach and Martin Counties drains into the Loxahatchee River, the only Florida waterway on a federal list of 150 wild and scenic rivers.</p>
        <p>The property, Cypress Creek, had been sought by the counties' environmental officials to preserve adequate flow in the Loxahatchee, which has become increasingly saline as development diverts fresh water.</p>
        <p>But Watermark -- like MacArthur before it -- rejected several offers from Palm Beach County in favor of higher bids from developers. Officials from the two counties are still trying to buy some Cypress Creek land, but are pessimistic.</p>
        <p>In California, the Cowell Foundation -- pressured by local officials -- has found a solution for its ranch in Contra Costa County that promises both profit and preservation.</p>
        <p>The foundation's president, Mary S. Metz, set off a public furor last year when she sent letters to organizations that had received grants warning that support would shrink if the land could not be developed.</p>
        <p>''The foundation is very worried about the negative effect that such a decrease in grant-making capacity would have on current and future grantees and wanted to alert you,'' Ms. Metz wrote in one letter.</p>
        <p>When newspapers published the letters, the appeal backfired. County supervisors threatened to redraw zoning for the land in a way that would have banned construction.</p>
        <p>''This was an example of a foundation that we thought had different values behaving very much like a greedy developer,'' said Donna Gerber, a county supervisor.</p>
        <p>Faced with a total building ban, the foundation agreed last week to sell 4,000 acres to the Trust for Public Land and build only on the remaining 400 acres, greatly reducing its profit. ''There have been compromises on all sides,'' Ms. Metz said. ''The foundation just wants to get back to its work.'' It remains to be seen if Cowell cuts any grants.</p>
        <p>In the wake of these and other recent deals, a debate simmers among conservationists, ethicists and the foundations themselves, with everybody reluctant to confront the issue of balancing their fiduciary and environmental responsibilities.</p>
        <p>At a retreat this year at the Hastings Center, Dr. Klemens, of the  Wildlife Conservation Society, said that foundations should consider more than the profits from land sales -- just as an art museum does not sell its works without considering their aesthetic significance. Some legal experts at the meeting, though, said the law did not allow appraisals of land beyond its dollar worth.</p>
        <p>Some suggested that these deals be treated like the sale of farmland, where tax breaks are given as long as the land is cultivated. When farmland is sold for a new purpose, the seller usually must compensate a county for the taxes avoided while the land was farmed.</p>
        <p>Christopher J. Elliman, a trustee of several conservation groups, said that part of the solution lies with those who donate land.</p>
        <p>If a donor does not want land to be developed, an easement restricting use should be given to a second group willing to fight in court to prevent its despoliation, Mr. Elliman said.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, he added, there would always be pressure to sell. ''Until you get a generation of trustees for whom values have changed,'' he said, ''in the end, people will define fiduciary in the most classic legal terms -- that you get the most dollars you can.''</p>
