        <p>Darryl Hamilton was back in the starting lineup for the Mets tonight, and all it took, Manager Bobby Valentine said, was an exceptional performance in early batting practice.</p>
        <p>''He had his best batting practice of the year,'' Valentine said. ''He came out early, ran a little, I was throwing, he was hitting. He and Abbott both seemed like they're at the top of their game. We might as well get them in there while they are.''</p>

        <p>Darryl Hamilton was back in the starting lineup for the Mets tonight, and all it took, Manager Bobby Valentine said, was an exceptional performance in early batting practice.</p>
        <p>''He had his best batting practice of the year,'' Valentine said. ''He came out early, ran a little, I was throwing, he was hitting. He and Abbott both seemed like they're at the top of their game. We might as well get them in there while they are.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton, who started in left field for Benny Agbayani and batted leadoff, ended up going 2 for 4 with a run batted in and a run scored. He seemed surprised that one batting practice session could earn him a start.</p>
        <p>Kurt Abbott started at shortstop for Mike Bordick, who was scheduled to get one game off on this four-game series on artificial turf. But Valentine had seemed pessimistic about Hamilton's ability to contribute much because of his surgically repaired left big toe.</p>
        <p>Hamilton and Valentine spoke on Thursday, and Hamilton said the manager's interpretation of his injury was ''not an issue.'' In fact, Hamilton said, he feels better now than he did when he came off the disabled list after four months in early August.</p>
        <p>''As long as I can keep going and not worry about it too much, I'll be all right,'' he said. ''Sure, I'm going to have a little limp. I've had two surgeries in eight months. I don't think it's going to be 100 percent. But I think I'm getting better. I feel like I'm running a little bit better.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton started 17 of the team's first 23 games after he returned, but tonight's was just his third start in the last 13 games. He has been productive, hitting .291 since his return entering tonight's game.</p>
        <p>A Success in September</p>
        <p>Mike Hampton has not won in three September starts. But in his last six starts, going back to Aug. 12, he has allowed only five earned runs in 42 innings, for a 1.07 earned run average.</p>
        <p>This is common for Hampton, whose 2.32 career earned run average in September is his lowest in any month. The fact that he stays strong late in the season might be attributed to his superior athleticism. But Hampton had no theories to explain his September success.</p>
        <p>''Your guess is as good as mine,'' he said. ''I don't come up with anything new in September. I just do the same things.''</p>
        <p>Hampton has two losses and a no-decision this September because the Mets have given him little run support. If nothing else, matching up against the top starters on other teams may be good preparation for the playoffs, when Hampton will face more top pitchers and can expect more low-scoring games.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to say what it does,'' Hampton said. ''You just try to keep your same intensity regardless.''</p>
        <p>Hampton (13-9) will need to have it on Monday, when he faces Greg Maddux (17-8) in the opener of a three-game series against the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field. Glendon Rusch (10-10) starts against Andy Ashby (10-12) on Tuesday, and Al Leiter opposes Tom Glavine on Wednesday. Leiter was 15-7 and Glavine 19-7 before both started tonight.</p>
        <p>Intriguing Prospect</p>
        <p>The most intriguing Mets' prospect assigned to the instructional league, which begins this week in Port St. Lucie, Fla., is the right-handed pitcher Jae Weong Seo, who has pitched only 13 games in three professional seasons. Seo will be pitching for the first time since May 1999, when he had ''Tommy John'' ligament replacement surgery.</p>
        <p>Seo, who signed for a bonus of more than $1 million in December 1997, was not in shape this year because he lost a month of his rehabilitation serving in the military reserves for South Korea. The Mets decided to hold Seo out until the instructional league to give him time to properly recover. They are still optimistic about him.</p>
        <p>''We've had so many success stories of guys who came back from ligament transplant surgery that it's only a matter of getting him back to full strength,'' said Jim Duquette, the assistant general manager. ''We expect he'll be the pitcher he was before the injury -- one of our top prospects.''</p>
        <p>The Mets would like Seo, a 23-year-old starter, to begin next season at Class AA Binghamton. If he performs well there, he could make the jump to the majors quickly.</p>
        <p>''When he's healthy, we expect him to move fast,'' Duquette said.</p>
        <p>The Mets' top prospect, the Class AA outfielder Alex Escobar, will also be at the instructional league so the team can make sure he is healthy after he strained a muscle at the end of the season. Escobar is scheduled to play winter ball in Venezuela.</p>
