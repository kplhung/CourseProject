        <p>The MetroStars went on the attack in an attempt to offset their recent defensive deficiencies. The strategy paid off handsomely in a 2-1 overtime victory tonight in the opening game of this Major League Soccer playoff series against the Dallas Burn.</p>
        <p>Adolfo Valencia scored the winning goal with 10 seconds left in the sudden-death period when he turned to his left and beat Dallas goalkeeper Matt Jordan, producing the MetroStars' first playoff victory since 1996.</p>
        <p>''This goal is not for me,'' Valencia said. ''This is for the fans of the MetroStars. I knew there was less than a minute left when I got the ball and I thought of the fans.''</p>
        <p>Clint Mathis, who made the pass on Valencia's goal, scored the MetroStars' first goal in the 34th minute. Goalkeeper Paul Grafer preserved the victory by making a save on a penalty kick in the 55th minute, his biggest act since joining the MetroStars with two games left in the regular season.</p>
        <p>Valencia, who had been ineffective almost the entire game, made a brilliant move that had his teammates in awe, especially Tab Ramos, who had a constructive performance in midfield.</p>
        <p>''It was such a brilliant move, it wasn't fair,'' Ramos said with a laugh in a happy dressing room after the game. ''He's a striker a level above everyone else.''</p>
        <p>Mathis had no goals since scoring the league record five in Dallas on Aug. 26 in a 6-4 victory over the Burn. He missed numerous chances to score in the last three games of the regular season, including a penalty kick in the regular-season finale, a loss at New England.</p>
        <p>This time, Mathis made no mistake. Even though he was surrounded by a crowd, he beat Jordan with a left-footed shot from seven yards away after Mike Petke knocked down the ball with his head from a corner kick by Peter Villegas on the right.</p>
        <p>Dallas tied it in the 67th minute, when Bobby Rhine found himself completely unmarked 12 yards from Grafer and converted a cross from the right side by Ariel Graziani. Part of the reason Rhine found himself wide open was that Petke got caught out of position.</p>
        <p>''We thought he was offside,'' Petke said, ''but who cares? We won the game and that's all that matters.''</p>
        <p>Offense was on the mind of the MetroStars from the outset. They attacked from both flanks and through the middle.</p>
        <p>Lothar Matthaus ventured forward from his sweeper position numerous times, something he rarely did in the regular season.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars dominated play in midfield and forced the majority of the action around Dallas's penalty area, but they had difficulty connecting with one another other inside the penalty area. One time they were successful was just a minute before the goal, when Valencia eluded his marker and passed to Roy Myers, but his low shot from the left side was blocked by Jordan at the near post.</p>
        <p>A great deal of misunderstanding between Mathis and Valencia was the main reason the MetroStars had trouble connecting near Jordan. Myers was another reason. He was always late releasing the ball and tried to dribble in almost impossible situations.</p>
        <p>Alex Comas, who entered the game as a substitute early in the overtime, was presented with a good chance for the victory, but his shot from good position inside the penalty area on the right missed the target. Mathis also had a good chance with a minute left in the overtime before Valencia's winner.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>The MetroStars presented the winners of various awards before the game. CLINT MATHIS was voted most valuable player and scoring leader. Goalkeeper MIKE AMMANN was voted the team's best defensive player for the second consecutive year even though he missed the last six games of the season. MARK SEMIOLI took the humanitarian award for his work with the Heroes and Cool Kids program, where he is a mentor. . . . The second game will be played Wednesday in Dallas. If a third is necessary, it will be played here Saturday.</p>
