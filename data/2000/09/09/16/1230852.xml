        <p>The Republican campaign of Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney has begun broadcasting a commercial, ''Compare,'' in 18 states in its effort to take the offensive on the issues. It takes aim at Vice President Al Gore's stands on a prescription drug benefit in Medicare, on education and on tax cuts.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Maverick Media</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The 30-second commercial features statements about Mr. Gore's proposals in black on a stark white background, counterposed with color pictures of Mr. Bush. It then shows pictures in color of Americans of different ethnicity, as it speaks of people who will not get a tax cut under Mr. Gore's $500 billion plan for tax relief.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- A female announcer: ''Al Gore's prescription plan forces seniors into a government-run H.M.O. Governor Bush gives seniors a choice. Gore says he's for school accountability, but requires no real testing. Governor Bush requires tests and holds schools accountable for results. Gore's targeted tax cuts leave out 50 million people -- half of all taxpayers. Under Bush, every taxpayer gets a tax cut and no family pays more than a third of their income to Washington. Governor Bush has real plans that work for real people.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Health maintenance organizations are not popular, so it is not surprising that the commercial links Mr. Gore's prescription drug plan to H.M.O.'s. But to do so it has to stretch the facts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore does not force the elderly to accept his new prescription drug benefit. It is voluntary. And Medicare recipients can stay in traditional plans where they choose their own doctors. Mr. Gore's plan does rely on private benefit managers to manage the program -- just like private insurers do -- which encourages use of generic drugs and less expensive brand names. But these are not H.M.O.'s.</p>
        <p>Some critics argue that it is Mr. Bush's plan that would increase the number of older people enrolling in managed care. Mr. Bush would give people the ability to choose between the traditional Medicare program including a new drug benefit and government-subsidized private insurance packages. A question is whether the premiums would rise for traditional Medicare, causing more people to choose managed care.</p>
        <p>On schools, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore both propose testing and different kinds of accountability measures, but Mr. Bush's proposal calls for tests that would cover more grades and be more frequent than does Mr. Gore's.</p>
        <p>It is true that Mr. Bush's $1.3 trillion 10-year tax-cut plan would give a tax reduction to every income bracket while Mr. Gore's plan for $500 million in targeted tax cuts would give tax breaks only for purposes like college education or child care.</p>
        <p>SCORE CARD -- With its tag line, ''Governor Bush has real plans that work for real people,'' the spot suggests that Mr. Gore is not credible and neither are his programs. But Mr. Bush has his work cut out for him. Many polls show that voters trust the Democratic candidate more on health care and education. And while Mr. Bush may have the Republicans' traditional advantage when it comes to tax-cutting, right now tax cuts are not one of the top concerns of voters.</p>
