        <p>Negotiators for Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore neared agreement today on formats for the three presidential debates, although ''some sticking points'' remain, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>''There was substantial progress made toward an agreement that allows for more variety in the formats,'' the spokeswoman, Karen P. Hughes, said. ''There are still some areas that have not been agreed to.''</p>
        <p>The Associated Press, citing unnamed sources close to the negotiations, reported tonight that the candidates had tentatively settled on three formats: one traditional two-lectern debate, one town hall meeting and one ''talk show'' forum.</p>
        <p>The two campaigns met in Washington today and were to resume negotiations on Saturday. The talks began a day after Mr. Bush, ending weeks of resistance, accepted a schedule proposed by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. The proposal, agreed to earlier by Mr. Gore, calls for debates on Oct. 3 in Boston, Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>At an appearance earlier today in San Diego, Mr. Bush said that he wanted to strengthen the armed forces, take better care of veterans and devote more resources to a full accounting of those who were missing in action.</p>
        <p>The last item was the focus of a short speech here to mark Remembrance Day, which honors people who never came home from armed  conflicts as well as those who were prisoners of war.</p>
        <p>''Today we remember with special gratitude those who were held against their will by our enemies and those whose fate is still unknown,'' Mr. Bush said in Balboa Park, near downtown San Diego.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush's remarks were guaranteed to resonate in a region where many military people live, they also reflected his campaign's belief that the issues of military readiness and stewardship of the armed forces would benefit Mr. Bush nationwide, especially among men.</p>
        <p>He said that under President Clinton, the armed forces were suffering from an ambiguous sense of mission, inadequate resources and low morale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's strategy for trying to compete against Mr. Gore in California -- and for trying to capture swing voters in crucial states -- pivots on talking about traditionally Democratic issues in ways that cast him as a progressive, sensitive Republican.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bush did that today, visiting an elementary school where a majority of students did not speak English as a first language.</p>
        <p>He told educators at Central Elementary School that there was an important federal role in education: to funnel money to state and local districts and hold those districts accountable for their use of the money.</p>
