        <p>If an Olympic competition for overplotted movie is ever held, ''Circus'' seems a likely contender for the gold.</p>
        <p>Even the most hardhearted judge is likely to award it a perfect score for self-awareness well into the proceedings when a big goon called Moose (Tiny Lister) says, ''I don't understand what's going on.''</p>
        <p>Spectators have every right to agree, even when the plot is hastily explained at some length toward the finish. Nevertheless, as in a circus of the three-ring kind, this ''Circus'' offers plenty to watch: the bloody ear biting by a man who isn't even Mike Tyson, the dog on the treadmill, the bare-breasted masseuse, the homage to Orson Welles's ''Lady From Shanghai,'' the garroting of a woman (Amanda Donohoe) in a lovely manor house, the barbecuing (to onlookers' cheers) of thick steaks in an England still sensitive about its outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalitis and the seedy seaside charm of Brighton.</p>
        <p>And all these details are subsidiary to the main event, based on a screenplay by David Logan and directed by Rob Walker, in which gangsters and grifters and various subspecies of their ilk are double- and triple-crossing one another from start to finish.</p>
        <p>The plot seems to have something to do with Bruno (Brian Conley), a big-time British lowlife whose embezzling accountant (the one who loses an ear before dying) has gotten him in tax troubles that prompt him to conceive a swindle involving the sale of his shipping company and the transfer of millions of dollars to a safe haven in the Cayman Islands.</p>
        <p>This scheme enmeshes the film's most intelligent and appealing character, Leo (John Hannah, the Scottish actor who was so good as the bereaved gay lover in ''Four Weddings and a Funeral''). Leo and his wife, Lily (the appealing Famke Jannsen), a gangster's moll with a history of duplicity, are planning to ''do the whole Ernest Hemingway-type thing'' in Cuba just as soon as Leo pulls off one last job, a murder for hire.</p>
        <p>But is Lily what she seems? After all, practically nobody else in ''Circus'' is. Nearly everybody seems to be betraying everybody else. Mr. Hannah and Miss Janssen are fun to watch in a gallery of colorful characters; just don't expect much sense from all the clowns in this ''Circus.''</p>
        <p>''Circus'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parents or adult guardian). It includes bloody torture and shootings, sexual activity, nudity and strong language.</p>
        <p>CIRCUS</p>

Running time: 95 minutes. This film is rated R.</p>
