        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Sept. 14 editorial about the movie theater ''crisis'' ends with a question: ''Is there enough good material to put on all those screens?''</p>
        <p>The answer is a resounding yes.  But almost none of it gets beyond screenplay format. Rightly or wrongly, most of Hollywood and its financial backers believe that the American public won't pay money to see good material, so those screenplays don't make it to celluloid.</p>

        <p>Personally, I think Hollywood is wrong. But as the screenwriter Bill Goldman once said about the industry, ''Nobody knows anything.''</p>
