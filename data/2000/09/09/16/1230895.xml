        <p>Sporting ceremonies tend to give me the willies, what with the attempts to gloss over centuries of genocide and homicide and fratricide.</p>
        <p>It's that way back in the States, with ersatz cowboys and artificial Indians frolicking around as if the westward expansion were one long square dance. And in this wonderful country totally on the other side of the world, they came up with a parade of industrious suburban lawn mowers and energetic Aboriginal warriors tonight in the opening ceremony for the 2000 Summer Games.</p>
        <p>When they get the symbols out of the way, sometimes the organizers can get things very, very right.</p>
        <p>Back in 1996, the lighting of the Olympic flame in the heart of Dixie was performed by a man, Muhammad Ali, who had traded his self-styled slave name for a Muslim name, and had somehow emerged from shunned draft dodger to national, as well as global, hero.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Australia found its own gesture that was far more than dancers celebrating a dubious past. There was the very considerable reality of an athlete of Aboriginal birth, Cathy Freeman, lighting the Olympic flame after six other legendary Australian women had escorted the torch around the stadium.</p>
        <p>''The Olympic Games are unique,'' Juan Antonio Samaranch, International Olympic Committee president, had said a bit earlier. ''They unify men and women of all origins and creeds.''</p>
        <p>Fair enough, but too often there is this manic compulsion to show the world that everything is fine. Places that have been around for a while can tap into a reservoir of shared myth and common dreams, but with hybrid, new-found lands like Canada and the United States and Australia, it gets tricky.</p>
        <p>Early tonight, there was some allusion to the fact that Olympic Stadium had been erected on what was once tribal homeland. The implication was that everything is all right now that the land has once again become a ceremonial center, albeit for Olympic delegates and corporate sponsors and other down-home types.</p>
        <p>In fact, there is palpable anger beyond the odd protest. Aboriginal artists refer to stolen land, stolen children, stolen history. The late Lin Onus in a powerful show called Urban Dingo at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney shows the earth taken over by cruel fences as well as ''earth lice,'' that is to say, settlers' sheep. And the late Emily Kam Kngwarray in a show at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra raises hope that wildflowers might once again bloom after a rain in the desert. The strongest art goes far beyond symbols into raw truth, but pop sporting ceremonies can promote spurious messages.</p>
        <p>For all that, this nation is changing. Urbane Sydney has Greek and Italian names everywhere, a Muslim woman gave me directions outside the stadium, there are people with Asian faces and Australian accents, and here and there is a constable, a hotel clerk, an Olympic hopeful, with Aboriginal features.</p>
        <p>The opening ceremony wrestled with Australian history and myth. There was a prehistory of all the beasties that lurk in the sea, followed by the awakening of bare-chested ancient warriors, now honored after most of them were annihilated. Then there was a tribute to fire that purged the earth, leading to the germination of a new age. I could have sworn I saw a cluster of red chilis giving birth to a young girl in a pink dress, all too Freudian for me.</p>
        <p>There was a rollicking Aussie version of the taming of the West -- going from rudimentary tin-roofed shacks out in the bush to modern skyscrapers on the coast. Finally there was the arrival of five rings of color, a knowing admission that this nation of some 19 million people is trying to come to grips with its massacres the way the United States would like to get past the land grabs and slave ships of its own manifest destiny.</p>
        <p>The choice of Cathy Freeman to open the Games was lovely, although the Australians did not go nuts the way Americans did when Ali materialized four years ago. Different people.</p>
        <p>The best part of this night, every four years, is still the parade of athletes -- including the couple of hundred Koreans all wearing dark blazers and orange ties and khaki pants in a brokered truce tonight. Not being able to tell North Koreans from South Koreans was better than all the spray-painted history of too many ceremonies. The parade returns the Olympics to a celebration of men and women who run and swim and lift huge weights and other essentially harmless acts.</p>
        <p>Let the athletes march -- Africans in flowing robes, Georgians in folk dresses, Canadians in hopelessly clunky blouses, various Caribbeans sporting snappy boaters, Brazilians bobbing up and down like Pele after a goal, Indians in orange turbans, Italians in Day-Glo slacks looking suave, Saudis in bright pink burnooses, a Senegalese guy talking on the cell phone, Spaniards waving fans, a happy dancer from East Timor, and then the Australians, with the handsome stadium shaking with well-deserved pride and happiness.</p>
        <p>Most of the athletes were sweetly anonymous, people you never saw before and will never see again, but they had the brightest smiles and the friendliest waves, and what did it matter that in the next 16 days the vast majority will finish far up the track, swallow the backwash of somebody else's water, get knocked to the mat in the opening seconds? They were here. They marched. The Games are on.</p>
