        <p>The Board of Regents voted 10 to 4 today to approve a new four-year master plan for the City University of New York that advocates said would strengthen a network of community and senior colleges that has served as a gateway to higher education for generations of New York City residents.</p>
        <p>The plan sets six priorities: improving teacher education; expanding the use of technology in teaching; increasing the collaboration with the Board of Education; creating programs that foster economic development in the city and state; moving toward a core curriculum at each campus; and building an undergraduate program within CUNY that will gain a reputation as a highly selective public campus, like the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
        <p>The main opposition to the plan centered on CUNY's efforts to improve the caliber of the incoming students to its senior colleges and the removal of remedial instruction at those colleges. Critics say those efforts will make it unfairly difficult for students from poor neighborhoods to gain admission to CUNY's bachelor's degree programs.</p>
        <p>The Regents approved that part of the plan last November, when CUNY  submitted it as an amendment to its current master plan. But they conditioned their approval on a close review of how the remedial policy was affecting enrollment.</p>
        <p>Several regents strongly objected to voting on the new master plan today, saying it was being approved before they could see the impact of the remedial proposal on students, faculty and the community.</p>
        <p>''We are told that there will be no significant impact, but I don't believe that,'' Ricardo E. Oquendo said.</p>
        <p>A few regents who voted for the plan warned the university that they  would continue to watch it closely. And they linked their support for the plan today with a call for CUNY to  establish enrollment and performance targets for academically weak students.</p>
        <p>CUNY officials said earlier this week that their efforts had already begun to attract more students. They cited a 5 percent increase in freshman enrollment this fall, the first such increase in five years.</p>
        <p>Carl T. Hayden, chancellor of the Board of Regents, said that there were good reasons for skeptics to see the elevation of CUNY's admission standards as having a negative impact on the ability of disadvantaged students to be admitted to the university. But, he added, the changes could also be viewed as creating ''a portal of enhanced opportunity.''</p>
        <p>''CUNY has a great deal to do to ensure that a student admitted to its community colleges has not lost the chance of acquiring a baccalaureate degree,'' Mr. Hayden said.</p>
        <p>CUNY officials said today that they welcomed the vote of confidence from the Regents. Herman Badillo, CUNY's chairman, and Matthew Goldstein, its chancellor, said they would seek more money to pay for the initiatives in the master plan.</p>
        <p>The Regents also announced that the Wallace-Reader's Digest Funds had awarded a $3.9 million grant to the State Education Department to help pay for programs to train and recruit school principals and superintendents. The Regents board is overhauling the certification requirements for principals and superintendents, much as it recently strengthened the requirements to gain teacher certification.</p>
