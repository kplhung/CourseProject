        <p>Mixing election politics and international diplomacy, Vice President Al Gore told Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India today that as president he would make passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty his first foreign policy initiative in Congress, and he urged India to adopt the treaty as well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, reviving a promise he made last fall, was clearly suggesting that in rejecting the treaty a year ago, the Republican-led Senate had given India an easy excuse to keep its nuclear testing program alive, and had thus contributed to the dangerous standoff between India and Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, has said repeatedly that he opposes the treaty, on the ground that it would limit America's nuclear leadership.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's comments to the visiting Indian prime minister today came at a private meeting between the two men after lunch at the State Department, aides said at a White House briefing.</p>
        <p>At other points during the day,  President Clinton and a variety of  administration officials went out of their way to praise Mr. Vajpayee and signed a raft of agreements, from Export-Import Bank loans to civil aviation pacts. But the administration left in place -- and left largely undiscussed -- economic sanctions imposed on both India and Pakistan after they conducted nuclear tests two years ago.</p>
        <p>And despite talk between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Vajpayee about closer relations -- this is the second meeting between the two men in six months -- India made no commitments beyond a continuation of its current voluntary moratorium on further nuclear testing.</p>
        <p>''I think we have worked hard together to move our relationship from one of too little contact and too much suspicion to one of genuine efforts to build a long-term partnership,'' Mr. Clinton said in the Oval Office this morning, the prime minister at his side.</p>
        <p>But their meeting also had an air of farewell about it, much like Mr. Clinton's session last week with President Jiang Zemin of China. Mr. Clinton made clear that he regarded his effort to strengthen ties to India a major accomplishment of his administration.</p>
        <p>''We should look at this as a long-term effort that -- I can speak for myself -- I hope goes well beyond my presidency,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''I don't think it should be another 20 years before an American president goes to India.'' Mr. Clinton visited the country earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The prime minister described his meetings in Washington as ''part of a continuing dialogue between the world's two largest democracies,'' and he added a ''tribute to the Indian-American community, which has been such an effective bridge in strengthening Indo-U.S. ties.''</p>
        <p>The president and the prime minister talked about everything from trade to the territorial battle over Kashmir, and then the focus quickly shifted to Mr. Gore's lunch at the State Department for Mr. Vajpayee and to the subsequent private meeting between the two.</p>
        <p>Under the glittering glass chandeliers in a State Department dining room, Mr. Gore basked in an incumbent's perk: acting as host of a state luncheon and talking peace with a world leader. Mr. Gore said India, the world's largest democracy, and America, the world's oldest democracy, shared a special bond, and made only glancing reference to India's nuclear weapons capability.</p>
        <p>''As the world's two leading democracies, we bear a special responsibility to take the lead in meeting the challenges that all democracies face,'' Mr. Gore said. ''We must work together to ensure that democracy's promises are realized by all our people, that all benefit from freedom. Quality education, public health, a clean environment -- these are the goals we share and which together we can achieve. Threats that undermine democracy, such as terrorism and the proliferation of dangerous weapons technologies, are concerns we also share and will work together to address.''</p>
