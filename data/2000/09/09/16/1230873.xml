        <p>THE INTERNET</p>
        <p>NEW MEDIUM, OLD TACTICS -- In addition to allegations of dirty tricks in conventional campaigning, Republicans and Democrats are accusing each other of stealing Internet tactics. Democrats are complaining that the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush copied techniques behind their latest e-mail drive. The Bush campaign countered that Vice President Al Gore's re-designed Web site was ''a pale imitation'' of its own site. The Democratic National Committee began an e-mail appeal in August that asked supporters to become ''e-precinct leaders'' by sending e-mail about the party to 10 friends. The appeal cited the victory of John F. Kennedy in 1960 by a margin that amounted to one vote per precinct. On Thursday, the Gore campaign distributed that e-mail message to its list of supporters. The same day, the Bush campaign sent supporters an e-mail announcing the ''Bush E-Train,'' which encouraged them to send campaign e-mail to their friends. The message also cited the one-vote-per-precinct victory in 1960.</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>NADER WINS BALLOT SPOT -- A federal judge has ordered that Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee for president, be placed on the ballot in West Virginia. State officials had ruled that Mr. Nader lacked sufficient qualifying signatures, prompting him to challenge the state's ballot-access laws as unfairly burdensome. In his ruling yesterday, Judge Charles H. Haden II did not address Mr. Nader's underlying complaints but simply ordered his name put on the ballot. The move means Mr. Nader is now on the ballot in 42 states and the District of Columbia. He is still facing a ballot-access fight in Illinois, which his aides say they expect to win. They are also appealing cases in North Carolina and South Dakota. He is not expected to be on the ballot in Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Oklahoma and Wyoming.</p>

        <p>THE PRIMARIES</p>
        <p>CAMPAIGN WITHOUT A CANDIDATE -- Linda Chapin, the Democratic candidate for Congress from Orlando, Fla., still awaits the selection of her opponent in a closely watched fight for an open seat. But other rivals are trying to keep her hopping. The Florida Republican Party and the Associated Builders and Contractors are running advertisements directed at Ms. Chapin, a well-known former Orange County chairwoman, trying to soften her up for whichever Republican wins a primary runoff on Oct. 3.</p>
        <p>In the $150,000 advertising campaign by the builders group, Ms. Chapin is taken to task for her record on taxes and the purchase of an ''$18,000 bronze frog'' for a local park. The spot is punctuated by a croaking sound. Ms. Chapin says the commercial is misleading because she simply voted as one member of the county board to fund an art-in-the-park program. ''I didn't select the frog,'' she said, noting that it is five feet tall.</p>
        <p>Democrats believe and Republicans fear that the winner of the runoff between State Representative Bill Sublette and Ric Keller, a lawyer, will have a difficult time overtaking the favored Ms. Chapin in the month before Election Day, turning over a Republican seat now held by Bill McCollum, who is running for a Senate seat.</p>
