        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was pleased to see that CUNY's commitment to higher standards was having the expected result of an increase in enrollment (front page, Sept. 13). The direct relationship between the quality of an institution and the number of students who enroll is well documented.

        <p>I was pleased to see that CUNY's commitment to higher standards was having the expected result of an increase in enrollment (front page, Sept. 13). The direct relationship between the quality of an institution and the number of students who enroll is well documented. Therefore, I was troubled by the suggestion that the increase had something to do with a lowering of admission standards.</p>
        <p>I have been on the faculty of Baruch College, teaching finance, for 12 years. I have watched Baruch take a leadership role in raising standards both for incoming freshmen and exiting seniors. I have seen the cumulative results of these policies in my classes. There is no doubt that current students are much better prepared for difficult material.</p>
        <p>Any suggestion that we are compromising our standards to increase enrollment is misplaced.</p>
