        <p>Proceeding without a former teacher accused of molesting a 12-year-old boy, lawyers representing the former pupil in a civil suit he brought years later said yesterday that they would show that school officials ignored obvious signs of a bizarre relationship between the two.</p>
        <p>In his opening statement to a State Supreme Court jury in Manhattan, Michael G. Dowd, one of the lawyers, described the teacher as a sexual predator who seduced Brian O'Rourke, now 25, when she was his seventh-grade homeroom teacher at a Bronx parish school. Though she continued to demand sex and to lavish attention on him at school, Mr. Dowd said, and though students and some teachers became suspicious, their superiors made no effort to investigate.</p>
        <p>Since the teacher, Linda Baisi, also a former nun, has failed to appear in court or dispute the allegations, the trial is focusing on whether the St. Frances de Chantal School and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York are liable for her conduct.</p>
        <p>''She seduced him on their time in  front of anyone who cared to look,'' Mr. Dowd said. The school authorities, he continued, were ''blind to what 12-year-olds could see.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the school and archdiocese, which are represented separately, also called Ms. Baisi's conduct a betrayal, not only of the boy but of the church and parish. But they said they had no reason to suspect that a popular and widely respected teacher -- ''a very spiritual person,'' said the school's lawyer, Eleanor Flach -- would abuse a pupil. ''How is it possible that a 40-year-old woman would have a sexual attraction to a 12-year-old boy?'' Ms. Flach said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Baisi, who has never been criminally charged, has effectively conceded the accusations, Judge Louise Gruner-Gans told the jury, since she is not participating. Ms. Baisi's lawyer, Brian O'Dwyer, said in an interview from Washington yesterday that since the archdiocese and parish would not pay her legal costs, and since she could not finance a defense or pay a judgment, ''There's frankly no reason for her to appear.'' Mr. O'Dwyer would not disclose her whereabouts but said Ms. Baisi was no longer teaching.</p>
        <p>In naming the school and archdiocese as defendants, Mr. O'Rourke is asserting that they were negligent in supervising Ms. Baisi and in failing to train teachers to report abuse.</p>
        <p>The trial will explore the archdiocese's relationship to the school and its responsibility for the training and supervision of teachers, issues that apparently have never been resolved in this context in New York. A spokesman for the archdiocese, Joseph Zwilling, said he could not discuss the matter, but lawyers familiar with sexual abuse cases said that while the Archdiocese had settled suits, they could not recall any going to trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dowd's opening statement, and later testimony by two former classmates, depicted Ms. Baisi moving the boy's desk to abut hers, bringing him breakfast daily, along with a copy of The Daily News so that he could read the sports section in class,  showering him with gifts and inviting him to her apartment regularly. Mr. Dowd said he would play tapes in court, secretly made by Mr. O'Rourke four years ago, in which Ms. Baisi acknowledged the relationship and begged her former pupil to keep quiet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dowd said Mr. O'Rourke was tormented by the relationship for years, was led to alcohol and drugs to ''deaden the pain,'' and still had difficulty with sexual relationships and sexual functioning.</p>
        <p>But Thomas M. Hyland, representing the archdiocese, said, ''There is no evidence that the archdiocese should have known of this horrible situation.''</p>
