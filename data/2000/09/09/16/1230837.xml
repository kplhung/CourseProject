        <p>Since 1850, when P. T. Barnum arranged a lucrative American concert tour for the renowned soprano Jenny Lind, dubbed the Swedish Nightingale, opera has occasionally produced a superstar who wins fans from outside the ranks of opera buffs. Luciano Pavarotti has been that star in our time. Many singers and rock bands crave the kind of success he has enjoyed with concert gigs at huge stadiums around the world. Of course, ever since Mr. Pavarotti realized he could reach more people and make more money through the Three Tenors concerts, he has scaled back his individual stadium appearances.</p>
        <p>So it was not surprising that his concert on Thursday night at Madison Square Garden, his first there since 1986, attracted an audience of 14,583. Ticket prices for the event, with the Opera Orchestra of New York conducted by Leone Magiera, ranged from $303 for a seat up close to $23 for a place in the stratosphere, where diehard Luciano fans had plenty of company. He was joined in three duets by a young Italian soprano, Annalisa Raspagliosi, who also sang six arias, nearly as many as the headliner.</p>

        <p>Since 1850, when P. T. Barnum arranged a lucrative American concert tour for the renowned soprano Jenny Lind, dubbed the Swedish Nightingale, opera has occasionally produced a superstar who wins fans from outside the ranks of opera buffs. Luciano Pavarotti has been that star in our time. Many singers and rock bands crave the kind of success he has enjoyed with concert gigs at huge stadiums around the world. Of course, ever since Mr. Pavarotti realized he could reach more people and make more money through the Three Tenors concerts, he has scaled back his individual stadium appearances.</p>
        <p>So it was not surprising that his concert on Thursday night at Madison Square Garden, his first there since 1986, attracted an audience of 14,583. Ticket prices for the event, with the Opera Orchestra of New York conducted by Leone Magiera, ranged from $303 for a seat up close to $23 for a place in the stratosphere, where diehard Luciano fans had plenty of company. He was joined in three duets by a young Italian soprano, Annalisa Raspagliosi, who also sang six arias, nearly as many as the headliner.</p>
        <p>It's easy to poke fun at events like this one, sponsored by Tibor Rudas, fast becoming the P. T. Barnum of classical music today. Instead of selling hotdogs and beer, uniformed vendors offered plastic cups of champagne garnished with strawberries. Audience members talked loudly  through the opening work, the overture to Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' which the players gamely tried to perform amid the din.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pavarotti's first appearance was greeted by a prolonged ovation and scattered shouts of ''I love you!'' Yet once he started singing, the audience was surprisingly attentive. Clearly, despite the pop star trappings and the heavy-duty amplification, many people derive something rewarding from such events.</p>
        <p>''Pavarotti at the Garden'' is opera lite. You don't have to bother with absurd plots or sit through interminable stretches of boring music. The program book, really a folded-over Pavarotti poster, offered no texts. Indeed, the house lights were turned off for theatrical effect. Many people could not have known what they were hearing, especially since along with the chestnuts, Mr. Pavarotti sang some little-known works, like an aria from Verdi's early opera ''I Lombardi.'' The concert provided intense but generalized emotions in short lyrical outbursts. What Mr. Pavarotti was singing about didn't matter. The aria from ''I Lombardi'' was vaguely stirring; ''Lamento di Federico'' from ''L'Arlesiana'' by Cilea was obviously tragic; and ''Che Gelida Manina'' from ''La Boheme'' was reassuringly familiar.</p>
        <p>The most curious offering was a scene from Act III of Verdi's ''Otello,'' the emotionally fraught and musically complex confrontation between the Moor and his unfairly accused wife, Desdemona. Otello is a role Mr. Pavarotti was once tempted by. He recorded it with mixed results, a concert performance conducted by Sir Georg Solti, but never sang it onstage, probably wisely: the role is too heavy for his large but essentially lyric tenor voice. Of course, Otello became the signature role of his much more disciplined rival, Placido Domingo, and that just might have heightened Mr. Pavarotti's interest in it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pavarotti seemed ill at ease in the music. His eyes were fixed on a printed text placed before him on a music stand. Predictably, the scene went over with the audience like a lump. What was he doing? Using a concert at the Garden as an occasion to challenge himself artistically? Trying to convince himself, and his critics, that he was not selling out? It was curious. That Mr. Pavarotti also needed cheat sheets to get through the group of light Italian songs with which he ended the program was rather scandalous, considering how much his audience had shelled out for tickets.</p>
        <p>As for the quality of his singing, it is impossible to say, given the amplification. He is nearly 65, and his splendid voice has, naturally, diminished. He almost didn't make it through one of his encores, ''La donna e mobile.'' Yet it is remarkable how much of his voice seems intact, though to know for sure we will have to wait until he comes to the Metropolitan Opera in January for ''Aida.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pavarotti and his promoters have long maintained that events like this one bring opera to the people and encourage them to try the real thing. I doubt it. My guess is that most people in this audience were quite content with the chance to hear the world's most famous tenor in an easy-to-take setting.</p>
        <p>More such chances may come. The buzz in opera circles is that Mr. Pavarotti's Met appearances this season may be his last. But he has learned to use a microphone with the savvy of Bing Crosby. Stadium concerts like this one may be a way to keep going. No doubt, many people will keep coming.</p>
