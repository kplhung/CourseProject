        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Did I miss something in my reading of the article? Should the title have been ''Who Wants to Be the Cheapest?''</p>
        <p>You write that Mary Barknecht ''lives on $11,000 a year, most of which goes for rent and health insurance.'' Why bother with the health insurance? Doesn't Medicaid cover you at this level? ''Her other expenses total about $100 a month.'' Is this a typo? Does she eat? What does she eat? Does she wash her clothes? Have a telephone? Electric lights? Maybe she should write a book, but I guess that would be too complicated.</p>

        <p>And for Jean Thilmany, going to the movies is too complicated. She is constantly trying to get out of dinner invitations. Apparently these are very complicated activities. What if someone else pays? Is that less complicated? Is it the activity or the cost?</p>
        <p>Let me get this straight. If I simplify my life it means I can't spend any money. Or is it what I spend the money on that complicates it? I can't eat out? Buy perfume? Can I buy the newspaper or do I have to read the ones other people have thrown out? What about taking the train? May I? Is there a distance requirement? How about if it's raining? May I buy an umbrella as long as it's cheap, like from the guy in front of Penn Station?</p>
        <p>I'm sorry. I think it would be much too complicated to simplify my life.</p>
