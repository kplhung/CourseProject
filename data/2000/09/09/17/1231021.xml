        <p>WILD KIDS</p>
        <p>Two Novels About Growing Up.</p>
        <p>By Chang Ta-chun.</p>
        <p>Columbia University, $22.95.</p>
        <p>In two jaunty, disturbing novellas from Taiwan, the author's first work to appear in English, Chang Ta-chun presents us with disaffected adolescents who roam city streets, complain about school, fantasize about gangster life and wear Chicago Bulls T-shirts. The global economy seems to have brought us a global literary type: the wily, bruised, commodity-loving, prematurely sophisticated teenager, with hapless parents and teachers in tow. These slim narratives, gracefully translated by Michael Berry, are related less by a unified authorial persona than by their similar settings in 1980's Taiwan, their knowing, offhanded dissection of family malaise and their notable fascination with storytelling. In ''My Kid Sister,'' the 20-something narrator artfully reminisces about his lifelong friendship with his volatile sister, who as a child became his muse, critic and co-conspirator. The occasionally wisecracking tone does not diminish the delicacy of their relationship, and the story's end is stunningly, perfectly abrupt. ''Wild Child'' features a teenage runaway who stumbles into a gambling den and finds himself involved in gangster mayhem. Brutal, pointedly anesthetizing, jaggedly written and willfully disorienting, this second novella is heavily and knowingly indebted to gangster movies and pop culture. Whether these stories merely chronicle or more profoundly illuminate a slice of Taiwanese culture and fantasy is hard to say; Chang's scope and achievement will be more obvious for American readers when more of his work is translated. What is clear is that in Taipei, as elsewhere in contemporary fiction, the kids are not all right.</p>
