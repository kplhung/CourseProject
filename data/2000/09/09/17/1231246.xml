        <p>THIS is a hymn to one of the joys of modern life: the humidity-removing, heat-defeating, allergy-freeing, work-enabling, sleep-assuring, noise-buffering invention named by a southern textile engineer nearly 100 years ago -- air-conditioning.</p>

        <p>THIS is a hymn to one of the joys of modern life: the humidity-removing, heat-defeating, allergy-freeing, work-enabling, sleep-assuring, noise-buffering invention named by a southern textile engineer nearly 100 years ago -- air-conditioning.</p>
        <p>One can bemoan the drain on the electrical supply or complain about how window-mounted units drip on pedestrians, but throughout the country, especially in the triple-digit inferno of the southwest, millions of people are circulating from air-conditioned house to air-conditioned car to air-conditioned office.</p>
        <p>There are thick books with pages and pages of footnotes that explain why that journey is possible -- the technical details of an engineering evolution that started in the 19th century with fan-ice systems (in 1881, it took tons of ice to cool the White House room where James A. Garfield lay dying of an assassin's bullet) and was accelerated by an absent-minded theorist named Willis Carrier, who established the relationship of temperature and moisture and laid the foundation for 80 patents (as well as his fame as the Father of Air-Conditioning).</p>
        <p>But who cares about books with footnotes? The point here is simply to marvel that the chunky, clunky machinery of yesteryear is now a petite great-great-grand-unit. Nowadays a compressor the size of a loaf of bread can cool a seven-room house, and then remain unobtrusive when fall, which by the calendar begins this  week, finally conquers summer.</p>
        <p>So this is the not the story of how air-conditioning changed everything -- which it did -- but of how air-conditioning has changed, because the smaller and more efficient units that make heat waves tolerable are still relatively new. And there will not be any footnotes.</p>
        <p>At the end of the 19th century, when refrigeration systems were entering meat markets and soda fountains, mechanically cooled air was ''the ultimate luxury item,'' according to Mike Pauken, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. The system installed in one industrialist's home weighed three tons and cooled only his library and  billiard room, plus several iceboxes in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>Carrier developed ''centrifugal refrigeration machines'' that replaced old-fashioned rotary-driven machines and used liquid refrigerants to remove moisture from humid air. Though still monstrous, the devices took up less space, making it more practical to cool large buildings: printing plants, department stores and the Rivoli Theater in Manhattan (where, to obtain a Fire Department permit, Carrier struck a match and dropped it into a container of refrigerant, proving it would not explode).</p>
        <p>Motors, of course, are smaller these days, but so are the molecules in the chlorine-free, non-ozone-depleting refrigerant. That means the cooling coils filled with refrigerant can be smaller. No longer are they the ''large-sized copper macaroni'' that William L. White described after his family's newspaper, The Emporia Gazette, had a new-fangled central air-conditioning system installed in 1935. He also described a condenser that  looked like the ''motor of a 1910 Packard sedan with a fresh coat of paint.''</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the first air-conditioning units for cars were not much smaller than that condenser. In the 1920's, C &amp; C Kelvinator outfitted a Cadillac with a unit about the size of a steamer trunk. The machinery was mounted on the back of the car, in place of the trunk, and was not much lighter than early home air-conditioners -- ''big honkers of units,'' as Christina Broikos, a curator of an air-conditioning exhibition at the National Building Museum in Washington last year, put it. ''It's incredible to think of how you'd install these units.''</p>
        <p>Carrier's first home units were bulky and prone to breakdowns, but his competitors' were no better. Frigidaire's first ''room cooler'' weighed 200 pounds and measured 28 by 18 by 49 inches. It was battleship gray and had a big fan behind a metal grille. General Electric began putting room coolers in wooden cabinets, like radios, and in 1931, a ''portable'' room air-conditioner went on the market. It weighed 1,200 pounds.</p>
        <p>Nowadays Carrier makes a 6,050-B.T.U. window air-conditioner that is 7 1/2 inches tall (engineers figured out how to turn the compressor inside on its side, reducing height without increasing depth). And the unit that cooled an office building in the 1930's -- a behemoth that weighed 100,000 pounds and stood 16 feet 6 inches wide -- has been succeeded by one that weighs 28,000 pounds and is seven feet wide.</p>
        <p>And that's the story of air-conditioning units, an epic if there ever was one. Now, how do epics end? Someone rides off into the sunset? We turn on the air-conditioner and get a cold drink? Refrigerators. That's another story.</p>
