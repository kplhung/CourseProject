        <p>Nowhere Else on Earth</p>
        <p>By Josephine Humphreys.</p>
        <p>341 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Viking. $24.95.</p>
        <p>SOMEWHERE out there, there has to be a thriving cult of worship for ''The Fireman's Fair,'' Josephine Humphreys's third novel. Its members, I imagine, reread the book once a year, sharing notes on its pleasures and subtleties, reciting its best lines of dialogue and making pilgrimages to Charleston, S.C., where it takes place. But I suspect they also go well beyond that.</p>
        <p>Drawing inspiration from the novel's central character -- who decides to dismantle his own life after Hurricane Hugo takes apart his hometown -- these devotees willfully get rid of all those status-enhancing props that no longer seem to count for much: the prestigious but consuming job, the expensive car, the luxury condo. With the faith of true believers, they emulate ''the big quit'' with which Humphreys's hero -- a ''congenitally unmarried'' divorce lawyer in his 30's -- alarms his friends. They hope, as he does, that their actions will turn their lives around and get them back on a track that's more congenial to a dropout philosophy improvised in the wake of stock market crashes and natural catastrophes. Their credo: ''Spend your capital, keep your guard down, build your house on sand.''</p>
        <p>Rueful, urbane and irreverent, ''The Fireman's Fair'' is a bittersweet comedy about premature midlife restlessness among the comfortably cushioned set. It also, incidentally, offers one of the funniest proposed revisions for ''Hamlet'' in recent memory: ''Go for the girl, get the hell out of Elsinore.''</p>
        <p>All of which is a lengthy preamble to the news that in her latest novel, ''Nowhere Else on Earth,'' Humphreys has ventured in such an unexpected direction and struck such an unlikely note of homespun earnestness that ''Fireman's Fair'' fanatics may find themselves reeling in confusion, wondering what's going on.</p>
        <p>''Nowhere Else on Earth'' is set in the backwoods swamplands of Robeson County, N.C., in the final years of the Civil War and just beyond. Its narrator, Rhoda Strong, is a forthright teenager of Scottish and Lumbee Indian descent. Scuffletown, where she lives, is a Lumbee settlement, well off the beaten track, that has seen no battle action. But its young men are in continual danger of being pressed into service -- not as soldiers (the loyalties of the Lumbees are too much in doubt for that) but as laborers on the earthworks at Fort Fisher, Wilmington's main point of defense against Yankee sea attack. For this reason, Rhoda's two brothers and a number of their friends have gone into hiding, eventually becoming a guerrilla gang and enforcing their own brand of justice against local ''macks'' (North Carolinians of Scottish descent), who harbor a longstanding hostility toward the Lumbees.</p>
        <p>Rhoda, confined by the dangers of war to a one-room cabin with her parents, is going stir crazy. She yearns for love, even if the object of her affections changes from week to week. At one point, it's her childhood best friend, Henderson Oxendine. Later on, it's one (or more) of the Lowrie brothers, scions of Scuffletown's most eminent Lumbee family. There's even the odd moment of sexual tease with a comatose Yankee soldier who comes under her care. (''It is easy,'' according to Rhoda, ''to love a man who is unconscious.'')</p>
        <p>In her heart, however, she knows which man she truly wants: Henry Lowrie, leader of the swamp gang, a kind of backwater Robin Hood-cum-Lawrence of Arabia who slips from being a freedom fighter to becoming a career criminal at war's end. The fighting may be over, but Henry and his buddies still find themselves stuck on the wrong side of the law -- or, rather, an unjustly administered local version of the law that handily accommodates a vigilante spirit. Rhoda's mother, Cee, has seen all this coming (maybe that's why she's called ''Cee''?) and has virtually disowned her daughter for having anything to do with Henry.</p>
        <p>There's plenty of promising material here: the view of the War Between the States from a not-my-battle Native American slant; the examination of how violence can become a way of life that's difficult to give up, even after the circumstances dictating its necessity have dwindled; the delineation of the tensions between a young girl's natural longings and the chaotic events that force her to repress them. All this is enough, thematically, for any novel, provided its characters have some life to them. But life, surprisingly, is the one thing that's lacking in Humphreys's characters.</p>
        <p>With the exception of Rhoda, whose stubbornness and quirks of observation add up to a character who's convincing if not especially memorable, most of the figures in ''Nowhere Else on Earth'' come off as caricatures. The villains are cut-and-paste examples of sadism and greed. The inevitable prostitute has a heart of gold and also proves to be a gifted anti-Confederacy informer. The heroes are tight-lipped to the point of being unreadable. The women suffer through rape, betrayal, abandonment and deprivation with a sense of sisterly solidarity. Good is good and bad is bad, and there's not much shading in between.</p>
        <p>Humphreys has clearly done her research, digging up the folksy terms for lice (''graybacks'') and maggots (''skippers'') and providing perhaps more detail than we need on Robeson County's turpentine industry. Her descriptions of the eastern Carolina landscape and of ''anchored but driftable'' Scuffletown occasion some of the book's most lyrical writing: ''To call the place a town might be misleading. It was more like a fishnet. Or a cobweb, a lacy swatch of tatting, a snare of mesh.''</p>
        <p>The Lumbees' conflicted feelings about their lack of tribal recognition from government officials -- Where's the proof? they always want to know. Where's the language and the relics?'' -- provide another lively component of the novel. Humphreys, with Rhoda as her mouthpiece, sometimes baldly decries this -- History would not recognize us or record us'' -- and sometimes suggests that it's a blessing in disguise. ''We could be dead or in Oklahoma,'' Rhoda's mother remarks, ''and it's better, probably, to be alive in North Carolina.''</p>
        <p>Make that ''barely alive'' -- for Humphreys is meticulous, too, in outlining the degree of hardship that afflicts the civilian population as supply lines to the South are cut off and exhausted soldiers abandon their regiments and forage off the land. The hunger and anarchy at war's end are vividly portrayed. So is the way that local animosities feed into and play off regional hostilities.</p>
        <p>Harder to swallow is Rhoda's attachment to her flat, flood-prone, bug-infested postage stamp of soil, especially considering the great sense it would make for her and Henry to ''get the hell out of'' postwar Scuffletown once there's a price on Henry's head. (Elsinore looks like a paradise by comparison. At least it has entertainment!)</p>
        <p>If Rhoda's refusal to move strains credibility, so do some of the book's narrative logistics. Henry often seems absurdly findable for someone who's supposed to be hiding from the law, while Rhoda's own sense of safety or danger more frequently reflects the demands of the book's next plot twist than the realities of the volatile world she inhabits. There's also one outright error: two characters who die in the same incident are reported, in an epilogue, to have died in different years.</p>
        <p>More disconcerting still is the moral stance that Humphreys seems to be taking in the name of retroactive political correctness. At times she comes across as downright sympathetic to actions she surely can't condone -- armed robbery, murder -- as long as they're committed by a Lumbee character and not a ''mack.'' If she had got more fully inside the skins of her characters, good and bad alike, this might not be such a stumbling block.</p>
        <p>As it is, there's something undilutedly partisan at work here, antipathetic to the complex intentions of fiction and considerably less convincing than the sassy sophistications of ''The Fireman's Fair'' and its predecessor, ''Rich in Love.'' First-person narrative, if its author is wily enough, doesn't have to be confined so strictly to the narrator's perspective. But Humphreys doesn't play with this possibility. Instead, she lets the reader see only what Rhoda sees.</p>
        <p>And there's a problem with Rhoda. She may be canny and intelligent, but she isn't in the least worldly -- and by the book's end she seems to fit around the imagination of her creator with all the comfort of a straitjacket. The ultimate impression left by ''Nowhere Else on Earth'' is of a writer taking a laudable chance on exploring a little-known aspect of Southern history -- and sacrificing her natural strengths in the process.</p>
