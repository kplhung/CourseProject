        <p>As members of the Amateur International Boxing Association -- Olympic boxing's governing body -- arrived in Sydney early last week, they were greeted by a large cartoon published in the national newspaper, The Australian.</p>
        <p>A referee was addressing two Olympic boxers in the drawing as they prepared for their fight.</p>
        <p>''Assuming that I haven't been bribed,'' the referee said, ''the judges are straight, neither of you are taking a dive and aren't on performance enhancing drugs, may the best man win.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, inside Sydney's Darling Harbor Exhibition Center, the site of the 2000 Olympic boxing competition, five small black video cameras had been positioned high above the stations where five judges will score each bout. The cameras are part of a new system, there to spy on the judges, and in case of a dispute, discern whether they -- through incompetence or fraud -- grossly misconstrued the fight.</p>
        <p>Seated beneath the new stealthy camera system Friday, the head of the Cuban national team, Alcides Sagarra, declined to elaborate on his recent prediction that his team could win as many as 10 medals in Sydney unless corrupt judging stopped the powerful Cubans. Sagarra recently served a suspension for his criticism of the boxing association, but he has good reason to be suspicious. At last year's world championships, his welterweight Juan Hernandez was at first denied a gold medal despite an overwhelmingly dominating performance. The verdict was later overturned and the judges involved were suspended.</p>
        <p>Indeed, 31 of the 34 judges and referees who will officiate at the Sydney Games are attending their first Olympics, part of an attempt by the international federation to shed the group of any tainted or unfit officials, a purge that goes back to the 1988 Seoul Olympics when nearly 40 bouts were protested.</p>
        <p>To some, each of these measures are a last-ditch attempt by Olympic boxing to save itself before the sport is thrown out of the Olympics as an embarrassment to the movement.</p>
        <p>With the book ''The Great Olympic Swindle'' (Simon and Schuster, Sept. 2000), by Andrew Jennings and Clare Sambrook, in Sydney bookstores documenting the chicanery inherent to amateur boxing through the decades, there are renewed threats to remove boxing before the next Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>The scrutiny had boxing officials last week longing for a clean, controversy-free competition, knowing the consequences should there be yet another fiasco like the Seoul Games or like last year's world championships.</p>
        <p>''We've done everything conceivable to make it right,'' Loring Baker, the general secretary of the boxing association, said Friday, the day before boxing competition was to start.</p>
        <p>But even in reform, Olympic boxing has a way of inviting a certain amount of comical disdain, especially for the more unusual new measures undertaken.</p>
        <p>The boxing association, for example, has informed its officials -- who act as both referees and judges -- that if they are offered a bribe to fix a bout they should not take it, but instead they should report it to the association. If the bribe and its amount can be proved, they will be awarded twice the bribe by the association.</p>
        <p>''That's a double-edged sword, because some say it proves bribes have been offered,'' Baker said. ''But we thought we were obligated to do everything we could to remove a shadow of a doubt.''</p>
        <p>Another ruling prohibits judges from accepting gifts from the leaders of national boxing federations, which, surprisingly, is something new for the Sydney Games.</p>
        <p>''Oh yeah,'' Baker said. ''They used to line up to give them gifts.''</p>
        <p>All of this has the boxers and their coaches a little uneasy. But after years in the sport, they seem to have grown accustomed to the shadiness. And for the most part, they believe overt duplicity is on the wane.</p>
        <p>''I think the playing field is leveling,'' said Tom Mustin, the United State boxing coach. ''I expect fair fights.''</p>
        <p>His star world champion at light flyweight, Brian Viloria, shrugged his shoulders when asked about the judging.</p>
        <p>''There's some mistakes,'' Viloria said. ''But it's out of your hands and you don't dwell on it.''</p>
        <p>Baker said that while there were 37 fights protested in the 1988 Olympics, there were just 3 in the Atlanta Games.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, if we have one very controversial decision in the 298 bouts during this year's competition,'' he said. ''That's the one everyone will want to talk about.''</p>
        <p>As Baker spoke, he stood beneath the new furtive video camera system.</p>
        <p>''It's not really there to spy on the judges,'' he said. ''It allows us an absolute view of judges' decisions, with the fight right in front of us on the screen, too. We can see what he saw.''</p>
        <p>It is true that the real spying is done by some national federation officials, who sit several rows deep in the grandstand with binoculars so they can look over the judges' shoulders.</p>
        <p>With a good view of the judging screen -- judges push a button for every punch landed -- they can tell which fighter is winning and relay the results to the boxer's corner in the ring. It is not a routine practice, but it is not unheard of either.</p>
        <p>Baker conceded that his federation probably will not be able to eliminate every conflict, debate or sly maneuver, and he acknowledged the negative public perception of boxing in some quarters.</p>
        <p>''But it is a subjectively judged sport and you can never get away from that,'' he said. ''You know, the National Football League keeps tinkering with its instant replay system. That's hardly fool proof.''</p>
        <p>But with the American team posing its strongest threat to the favored Cubans over the next two weeks in Sydney, there is sure to be added attention on the sport -- and pressure on boxing to clean up its act with a fair and equitable competition.</p>
        <p>More than just the five video cameras hung from the rafters of the Sydney Exhibition Center are taking in every hook, jab and judging button pushed.</p>
        <p>''It is imperative that the Games are controversy-free,'' Gary Toney, the United States team leader, said last week. ''It would be damaging if it is any other way. But I think we've gotten past that. A lot of changes have been made. I expect it to be fair and level.''</p>
        <p>And may the best man win.</p>
