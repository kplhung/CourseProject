        <p>AS conducting jobs go, on paper the music directorship of the Long Island Philharmonic is not exactly top-drawer. Unlike most regional orchestras, the Philharmonic doesn't perform a full season in a hall it can call its own with the same musicians on the roster. It has no city behind it, supporting it as a source of civic pride. And the pay, by classical music standards, is only average: $70,000 to $80,000 to conduct about a dozen concerts a year.</p>
        <p>Yet, starting Saturday when the orchestra opens its 22nd season, four conductors, ''young superstars on their way up,'' said David H. Peirez, chairman of the Philharmonic's board, will begin trying out for the position for which 250 people applied.</p>
        <p>Each finalist -- starting with Steven Smith, who conducts the season opener -- will lead both Classical and family or youth concerts during the year. The winner, or ''music director designate,'' selected by the board, the orchestra's musicians and indirectly by members of the audience, whose reactions to the candidates will be closely watched, will take over for the final pair of concerts in May, ''New Perspectives.''</p>
        <p>The four candidates are Mr. Smith, assistant conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra and music director of the Santa Fe Symphony and Chorus; David Wiley, music director of the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra and the Wintergreen Summer Music Festival, both in Virginia; Gisele Ben-Dor, music director of the Santa Barbara Symphony and the Boston Pro Arte Chamber Orchestra; and Markand Thakar, co-director of the graduate conducting program at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore. Ms. Ben-Dor and Mr. Thakar also cover as last-minute replacements at the New York Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>Geography is a major factor in the appeal of the Long Island job.</p>
        <p>''Working on Long Island,'' Ms. Ben-Dor said, ''could give you visibility in New York, just as my job in Santa Barbara gives me visibility in Los Angeles.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview from his home in Cleveland, Mr. Smith said, ''As a young conductor I'm always interested in music director positions. And there are exciting possibilities on Long Island. New York, after all, is a center of music.''</p>
        <p>From his home in Roanoke, Va., David Wiley said the availability of ''the wonderful pool of professional musicians'' in New York was a lure.</p>
        <p>That the Long Island post could be a steppingstone to bigger and better things is acknowledged in the music industry. ''Once you're reviewed in the New York area, you are noticed,'' said Stanley Drucker, the veteran principal clarinetist at the New York Philharmonic who has worked with both Mr. Thakar and Ms. Ben-Dor.</p>
        <p>''You're close to what's happening musically since everything comes to New York,'' Mr. Drucker said, ''and with so many things going on that a musician can be involved in, partake of, your development as a musician has to be furthered.''</p>
        <p>Music directors do not live by ambition alone. For Ms. Ben-Dor who lives in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., with her husband and two children, a post on Long Island would allow her to live and work in the same area. ''I could settle down and continue to combine my professional and personal lives in one organic way,'' she said in a phone interview from Geneva, where she is conducting opera.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thakar said in a phone interview from his home in Baltimore: ''I wouldn't be going to Long Island to build my career, necessarily. But there's a huge, untapped potential for the growth of the orchestra and its role in the community and as I continue to grow as a conductor I could help build an organization that reaches its potential.''</p>
        <p>The position is multifaceted, said Karen Barnes, who has been with the orchestra for 16 years, the last five as executive director.</p>
        <p>''We need someone who can act as an ambassador, be the face of the orchestra in the community,'' Ms. Barnes said. ''Someone to take a leadership role in directing the board in long-range planning. And someone who can deal with the staff.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Peirez said: ''The more the music director does, the more the identity of the orchestra grows. We haven't even tapped the resources here and we need to in order to keep growing.''</p>
        <p>The candidates acknowledged that outreach should be a major component of the job.</p>
        <p>''You've got to convince the public that music is a necessity, not a luxury,'' Dr. Wiley said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thakar said: ''Off the podium you have to be the face of the orchestra, out there to help get people into the hall. On the podium you have to keep producing great music -- the magic that transforms, exalts listeners -- to make them come back.''</p>
        <p>Whoever gets the nod to become the fourth music director of the Long Island Philharmonic will find an orchestra that has come a long way since 1979 when it was founded by Harry Chapin and other like-minded music lovers. At the time, there were symphony orchestras in Nassau and Suffolk, but Mr. Chapin and his supporters believed that Long Island needed a completely professional ensemble.</p>
        <p>Under the Christopher Keene, its founding music director for 11 years; Marin Alsop who followed for six years; and David Lockington, who stepped down at the end of last season after four years to take a full-time position as music director of the Grand Rapids Symphony, the Philharmonic, critics say, has matured into an orchestra that delivers first-class music.</p>
        <p>''The orchestra feels good about themselves; they accomplished a lot under David,'' said Ms. Barnes, pointing out that 89 percent of the musicians play the full season. This is an unusually high percentage for a freelance orchestra, she said.</p>
        <p>After almost folding twice because of financial difficulties, the orchestra has settled down. This month it moved out of its donated basement offices in a building here to reduced-rent space on the second floor of the same complex.</p>
        <p>While it has yet to achieve its founders' goal of presenting a full 13-week season on the Island, it has expanded to include five Classical concerts, four of which are performed at both Tilles Center in Brookville and Staller Center in Stony Brook; two ''Pops'' concerts;  two Family Concerts'; a New Year's Eve concert; and six concerts for students.</p>
        <p>Problems remain. Subscriptions have dropped, Ms. Barnes said, but single-ticket sales have gone up. Ticket sales account for 40 percent of the budget; the rest comes from state and local aid and fund-raising.</p>
        <p>Although this fund-raising has increased -- last year's gala brought in $500,000 -- the orchestra is hampered by identity questions. ''We don't have a city that considers us an important, valuable cultural asset and so gets behind us financially,'' Ms. Barnes said.</p>
        <p>And without a concert hall of its own, the orchestra must take dates that Tilles and Staller can spare, Ms. Barnes said.</p>
        <p>''Sunday nights are tough,'' Mr. Peirez said of Tilles. ''People don't like to go out then. We need a hall more centrally located that will give us more flexible dates and currently we are exploring a few possibilities that will help us grow.''</p>
        <p>The Long Island Philharmonic performs at 8 p.m. Saturday at the Staller Center in Stony Brook and 7:30 p.m. Sunday at the Tilles Center in Brookville. (631) 293-2222.</p>
