        <p>Chris Witty was going after posterity tonight. Some of her competitors were going after her.</p>
        <p>A silver and bronze medalist in speedskating in Nagano, Japan, in 1998, Witty was trying to become the first woman to win a medal in both Summer and Winter Games.</p>
        <p>Posterity was denied. In the inaugural women's 500-meter cycling time trial, Felicia Ballanger of France won the gold, Michelle Ferris of Australia won the silver and Jiang Cuihua of China won the bronze.</p>
        <p>Witty finished fifth.</p>
        <p>''To come here and finish fifth is pretty competitive,'' said Witty, a 25-year-old from Park City, Utah. ''It's not like I just came here for the ride. I think people see that now.''</p>
        <p>After the race, her coach, Des Vickie, gave her a hug and reminded her to savor the moment.</p>
        <p>''She hasn't really raced at this level since 1998,'' he said. ''It is very important after the ride that she takes time and thinks about what she has accomplished. We knew we could be competitive; that's what we came for. Competitive means there's a chance for a medal.''</p>
        <p>Witty began her cycling career in 1990, then left in 1996 to concentrate on speedskating. She returned to cycling in 1998. Vickie said several other athletes had brought up Witty's absence from the sport.</p>
        <p>''Some of the athletes came up to me and said, 'Des,  Chris can't come and stomp on our grounds when she wants to, and walk away,'' Vickie said.</p>
        <p>For at least 20 minutes tonight, Witty stomped on their turf. Daniela Larreal of Venezuela, the first cyclist of the new Olympic competition, finished the course in 35.728 seconds and therefore set an Olympic record. Three riders later, Witty broke Larreal's mark with a time of 35.23 seconds; for the next 15 minutes, her place in Olympic history seemed secure.</p>
        <p>''I tried not to watch,'' Witty said. ''I watched the Australians and that was pretty cool the way the people got behind the team. But it was a bummer to see your name go down the list.''</p>
        <p>The greatest threats to Witty's Summer-Winter medal hopes were Tanya Dubnicoff of Canada, Ferris and Ballanger, the reigning world record-holder and three-time world champion in this event.</p>
        <p>But there was an another obstacle: the Chinese.</p>
        <p>Yan Wang of China bettered Witty's time in a scorching 35.013 seconds, but Witty got a break when Dubnicoff started poorly and turned in a disappointing 35.486.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for Witty, Ferris then covered the 500 meters in 34.696 seconds. Even with that performance, Witty was clinging to third place with five cyclists to go. The first three failed to better her mark. But Jiang officially punctured Witty's dream and snatched it for her own. Jiang covered the course in 34.76 seconds, good for third place. Ballanger put the finishing touch on the competition, covering the course in 34.14 seconds.</p>
        <p>Will Witty return to cycling?</p>
        <p>''She'll be back in 2002,'' Vickie said. ''She promised me that.''</p>
        <p>Witty didn't seem sure. ''We'll see,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Reminded that she had told her coach she was coming back, Witty was noncommittal.</p>
        <p>''I told him I'd call him,'' she said.</p>
