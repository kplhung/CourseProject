        <p>The battle between accounting firms and the Securities and Exchange Commission escalated last week when Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney and an expert in battling money laundering, boiler room brokerages and other seamy sides of the financial world, testified at hearings in New York on the subject of auditor independence.</p>
        <p>The forum was held to debate a proposed S.E.C. rule to forbid relationships between accounting firms and clients that might produce conflicts of interest. For an accounting firm, an example would be conducting an internal audit of a company -- for the use of management -- as well as an external audit, upon which public investors rely. Three major accounting firms have criticized the proposal, saying that there was no proof that even a single audit has been compromised because an accounting firm had other relationships with the company. But, without naming names, Mr. Morgenthau countered with several examples of accounting firms that he said had engaged in questionable activities on behalf of clients.</p>

        <p>The battle between accounting firms and the Securities and Exchange Commission escalated last week when Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney and an expert in battling money laundering, boiler room brokerages and other seamy sides of the financial world, testified at hearings in New York on the subject of auditor independence.</p>
        <p>The forum was held to debate a proposed S.E.C. rule to forbid relationships between accounting firms and clients that might produce conflicts of interest. For an accounting firm, an example would be conducting an internal audit of a company -- for the use of management -- as well as an external audit, upon which public investors rely. Three major accounting firms have criticized the proposal, saying that there was no proof that even a single audit has been compromised because an accounting firm had other relationships with the company. But, without naming names, Mr. Morgenthau countered with several examples of accounting firms that he said had engaged in questionable activities on behalf of clients.</p>
        <p>One involved a bank, which the prosecutor said was the client of a major accounting firm; the bank, he said, had destroyed records of a $500 million transaction and created new back-dated records misrepresenting the deal. ''Our investigators  were surprised,'' he said, ''to learn that the accounting firm, despite being aware of the falsification, had issued a clean audit opinion, reporting no material weaknesses in the client's internal controls.'' A partner at the auditing firm told investigators that the false records were not a material issue because ''the client had made money on the transaction,'' he said.</p>
        <p>By the way, the bank in question was Long Term Credit of Japan, which failed in 1998, two years after Mr. Morgenthau's investigation.</p>
