        <p>CROSS HAIRS are trained on the green-and-yellow home page of DLJ Direct, the online brokerage firm. Literally. It is a Tuesday in late August at the new Fidelity Center for Applied Technology here, specifically, in a ''usability'' lab of the ''human interface design department.'' This is where Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund manager, does some of its most important research and reconnaissance.</p>
        <p>Today, Dawna Lovett is sitting in what looks like a bland office, with a desk, a lamp, a desktop computer and a window with partly drawn blinds. She is wearing a black headband with a white nodule placed above her left eye. A man with a Ph.D. in engineering psychology peeks over her shoulder. What looks like a Polaroid camera sits on a desk, between Ms. Lovett and the computer. It is actually a high-resolution infrared camera shooting beams of light into one of her eyes as she looks at the Web site.</p>
        <p>Not to worry. The light simply monitors eyeball movements. Ms. Lovett seems fine.</p>
        <p>So does Fidelity. Much has changed since this fund giant lost its aura of invincibility a few years ago. In 1996, Fidelity's top money manager, Jeffrey N. Vinik, led its flagship Magellan fund to the bottom tier of industry rankings after a disastrous bet on bonds, and few of Fidelity's other funds beat the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. Edward Crosby Johnson III, the company's longtime chief executive, was so stung by the headline ''Has Fidelity Lost It?'' on a cover of Fortune magazine in 1997, that he largely stopped speaking to the press.</p>
        <p>A maelstrom of mergers and acquisitions, meanwhile, has transformed the financial services industry. But Fidelity has kept to a more insular path, partly by using a Japanese management philosophy, known as kaizen and followed by Mr. Johnson, that emphasizes continuous improvement and retooling from within.</p>
        <p>One would be hard-pressed to call the  strategy anything but a success. This year, revenue is growing at a robust 41 percent rate, and profits more than doubled in the first half of 2000, compared with the corresponding period of 1999. Assets under management grew 25 percent last year; the firm now manages a staggering $1 trillion and is custodian to an additional $608 billion.</p>
        <p>Controlled by Mr. Johnson and his family, the privately held Fidelity manages the most retail and retirement mutual fund assets, has the most online brokerage customer accounts and runs the largest fund supermarket, where it sells its competitors' brands alongside its own. Fidelity also has a controlling stake in Colt Telecommunications, a $22 billion provider of local phone service in Paris and Frankfurt; runs the 426-room Seaport Hotel in Boston, and owns BostonCoach, a limousine service.</p>
        <p>But what is most striking about Fidelity is its drive to mesh next-generation technology with customer service. If its funds do not shoot out the lights, as they once did, they perform decently now. And for a company entrenched in the retirement market, consistency and service are emphasized over top-tier performance.</p>
        <p>''Performance continues to be extremely important,'' said Tracey Esherick, the Fidelity executive in charge of Powerstreet, the company's online brokerage firm. ''But how you service a relationship is critical.''</p>
        <p>Technology workers now outnumber Fidelity fund managers, analysts and traders by more than 18 to 1. Spending on technology passed $1.5 billion last year -- far beyond the totals for many competitors.</p>
        <p>So what is the new Fidelity seeking behind those infrared lights?</p>
        <p>The Technology  Pixels, Pagers  And Customers</p>
        <p>''Look at every pixel on the Web page as if it were a valuable piece of Boston real estate,'' Steve Elterich, the chief of Fidelity's e-business operations, recalled Mr. Johnson once instructing him.</p>
        <p>The technology center, known as FCAT (and pronounced F-Cat) is not an operation that one might expect to find at an asset management firm. Built last year, it is a multipurpose laboratory and workshop, where Fidelity tests and demonstrates next-generation technologies. There are Palm Pilots set up for online trading. There are brokerage-ready pagers and cell phones of all shapes and sizes. There are even scanners that identify a user by his eyeballs or the shape of his head.</p>
        <p>''It's an in-house think tank related to technology,'' said Robert L. Reynolds, who was appointed Fidelity's chief operating officer in June. ''It's looking for new applications, but it's also a place where technology people around Fidelity can get together.''</p>
        <p>All manner of research is taking place -- there is even a prototype system to let its legion of 5,000 phone representatives peek onto the home computer screen of a customer if he or she asks for help. But the depth to which Fidelity seeks to understand its customers is most apparent in the usability lab.</p>
        <p>The window with the Venetian blinds is actually a one-way mirror. On the other side is an observation room. It has seven monitors, lighted buttons, various levers and knobs, a seven-foot-high stack of audio-visual equipment, several videocassette recorders, a DVD player and some microphones.</p>
        <p>While one of the monitors shows an image of DLJ Direct, the online brokerage firm owned by Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, another shows how Ms. Lovett, a Fidelity employee, is reading an article on Fidelity.com. Usually, the test subject would be a volunteer from Fidelity's customer base, but Ms. Lovett is filling in while a reporter visits.</p>
        <p>Another monitor shows the Web page that Ms. Lovett is reading, but with a digital target superimposed and flickering across the screen.</p>
        <p>The cross hairs show where Ms. Lovett is looking at any particular moment. A third monitor in the room displays an outsized blowup of her eye, tracking the exact pixels that she is viewing. The idea is to fine-tune the Web site to eliminate every wasteful click.</p>
        <p>That level of usability testing ''is incredibly, exceedingly rare,'' said Jakob Nielsen, a former Sun Microsystems engineer and founder of the Nielsen Norman Group, a Silicon Valley firm that consults with companies on Web site design. Mr. Nielsen said that while usability testing was common in many industries, he had heard of eye-tracking tests being conducted only at universities like Stanford, for Internet-related research, and by the Navy and a few technology companies.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt it pays off dramatically, particularly for a site where people do a huge amount of transactions,'' Mr. Nielsen said. ''Errors are a disaster for that type of system. The return on the investment is so huge that you can't even discuss the cost of building a lab. It's trivial.''</p>
        <p>Fidelity's usability labs -- there are two at FCAT -- have produced thousands of hours of videotape that will be analyzed.</p>
        <p>''We're embarking on some major redesigns of our site,'' Mr. Elterich said. ''That's really been as a result of feedback we've gotten out of bringing in customers and having them interact with our site, and then trying and experimenting with different navigation approaches.''</p>
        <p>Thomas S. Tullis -- the man with the Ph.D. in engineering psychology -- is a Fidelity vice president who is in charge of the 14-person human interface design department. Fidelity built its first lab back in 1993, he said, but he has been in the field of usability testing since its infancy -- his dissertation, at Rice University, was on the layouts of computer screens. He also helped set up a usability lab at Bell Laboratories 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>''Of course, back then, we were doing usability testing of mainframe screens,'' he said. ''It was very different from what we do now.''</p>
        <p>Fidelity.com is a tightly woven collection of dozens of subsites, from Powerstreet to NetBenefits, which is used by Fidelity's retirement plan customers. Mr. Tullis is trying to make the site's total of 30,000 pages as easy to navigate as possible -- but he is also watching Fidelity's competition closely.</p>
        <p>A monitor near Ms. Lovett is flashing images of Web sites run by various rivals: DLJ Direct, Prudential, E*Trade, Scottrade. These are recordings of previous tests, and the cross hairs are sweeping over each page.</p>
        <p>''We have to follow Microsoft, we have to follow Intuit, we have to follow Schwab, we have to follow Citicorp,'' said Ms. Esherick, the head of Powerstreet. ''Almost everybody's a competitor.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Esherick said that she had even been watching how Lands' End and Neiman Marcus were using instant messaging online to communicate with their customers, and that Fidelity planned to start a similar, pilot program in a few weeks.</p>
        <p>It also plans to open a third lab for more infrared eyeball-testing, on cell phones, pagers and the like. ''It's really a different environment,'' Ms. Esherick said of wireless devices. ''How big is the screen for trading? Is it big enough for an active trader? How easy is the keyboard for transactions'' when you use little two-way pagers?</p>
        <p>It is no wonder that Fidelity spends so much on technology: Last year, the total was between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. By contrast, Stilwell Financial, the parent of the rival Janus Capital, spent about $75.8 million on capital expenditures, which includes technology, while Charles Schwab, the big discount and online broker, spent about $126 million on technology.</p>
        <p>''It's notable for their size how quickly they've been able to migrate on the Web,'' Matthew L. Vetto, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said of Fidelity. ''Particularly in areas such as wireless devices, they've been at the forefront.''</p>
        <p>James Lowell, a former writer for Fidelity-owned publications who now publishes Fidelity Investor, a newsletter that tracks the company, said the big fund companies obviously ''had to spend a few hundred million dollars to get online.''</p>
        <p>''But nobody comes close to Fidelity and its expenditures on its proprietary technological system,'' he added. ''If there is one thing Fidelity has always been intensely paranoid about, it is being left out of the loop.''</p>
        <p>By most accounts, that fear starts at the top.</p>
        <p>The Philosophy  Looking East  For Guidance</p>
        <p>There is a small conference room on the 25th floor of Fidelity's fund operations office at 1 Federal Street in downtown Boston. Different building, different day in August. The conference room, about the size of two parking spaces, has a table and a few chairs. There is a large drawing pad on an easel at one end, covered with sketches of screen shots from Fidelity's Web site.</p>
        <p>At the other end of the room, scrawled on a whiteboard, are a rough pie chart, along with arrows,  circles, squiggles and financial lingo like ''asset allocation.''</p>
        <p>Perched above the board is a stern notice: ''PROTECT FIDELITY'S INFORMATION. Erase the whiteboard. Take documents with you.''</p>
        <p>Certainly, Fidelity is a private, secretive company. Even its nondescript headquarters, at 82 Devonshire Street, a few blocks away, whispers where others shout.</p>
        <p>That building is around the corner from an office of Brown Brothers Harriman, a private bank, whose entrance is proudly announced by six faux columns and a fluttering crimson-and-white flag emblazoned with the firm's initials. By contrast, one could easily miss the entrance to 82 Devonshire, with only a small plaque that says simply ''Fidelity Building.''</p>
        <p>The quiet approach has everything to do with the Boston family that founded the company 54 years ago and has run it ever since. At the top is Mr. Johnson, 70, the patriarch, who has been in charge since 1977, when his father, Edward Crosby Johnson II, handed the reins to him.</p>
        <p>After a recent reshuffling of several top lieutenants, there was a fresh round of speculation on who might be in line to succeed Mr. Johnson: one of his deputies or his eldest daughter, Abigail P. Johnson, who owns the most shares and is an executive in Fidelity's fund management business.</p>
        <p>Neither Fidelity nor the Johnsons would say for sure, though the bigger question may be how the company will change after Mr. Johnson is gone. By most accounts, Mr. Johnson, commonly known as Ned, is an idea man who leaves the day-to-day operations to top deputies but does not hesitate to insert himself into any area of his company. His is not the traditional approach to management, at least not in Boston and other parts of the Western world.</p>
        <p>''We will embody kaizen -- each of us making small, gradual improvements in how we do our jobs,'' Mr. Johnson said in a letter to shareholders in Fidelity's 1999 annual report. ''Taken together, these small steps can make a big difference in helping us become more productive and cost-efficient.''</p>
        <p>Japanese management philosophies enjoyed some popularity in the 1980's but were certainly out of fashion when the Asian economy went into free fall in the late 1990's. Still, like his father before him, Mr. Johnson was influenced by Eastern thinking -- he is also a collector of Asian art -- and he has stuck with kaizen (pronounced KI-zen).</p>
        <p>''It is the typical Japanese management approach,'' said Masaaki Imai, who wrote a book called ''Kaizen: The Keys to Japan's Competitive Success,'' published in 1986. Mr. Imai founded a global consulting firm, the Kaizen Institute, which briefly worked with Fidelity a few years back, and during which Mr. Imai gave speeches to a few hundred Fidelity employees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Imai recalled that Mr. Johnson became so excited about kaizen that he commissioned a calligrapher to write the Japanese characters for the word and displayed them in his office.</p>
        <p>''When we use the term in the manufacturing sector, it means continual improvement as well as involving everyone in the organization,'' Mr. Imai said. ''Kaizen means making better use of the existing resources, and not necessarily using a lot of money.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, he added, the Western approach is more given to mergers and acquisitions.</p>
        <p>Kaizen has characterized Fidelity's quick response to its competitors. Mr. Johnson, for example, did not buy an online brokerage firm; he built one himself. When Schwab popularized the mutual fund supermarket in the mid-1980's, Mr. Johnson countered with his own.</p>
        <p>Now there is FCAT, Fidelity's new-economy research group.</p>
        <p>Fidelity, of course, has spent heavily on technology for years -- from $8 billion to $10 billion in the last decade, with the pace doubling over the last five years. And for its money,  Fidelity has attracted many new accounts and seen a rapid online migration of its existing customers. At the end of the second quarter, nearly 40 percent of Fidelity's brokerage customers were doing business online, up from 32 percent just six months earlier.</p>
        <p>In addition, 57 percent of the contacts made by retirement-account customers have come online this year, compared with 16 percent in 1998.</p>
        <p>The more technology, the cheaper the cost. Customer telephone calls to representatives cost Fidelity more than $13 each, on average. The average Internet interaction costs Fidelity about $4.</p>
        <p>Because of the online migration of its customers, Fidelity has been able to slow down its hiring of phone representatives, who make up nearly one-sixth of the company's work force of more than 31,000. Even though the company added more than eight million new customer accounts last year, the company's phones handled, on average, 3.1 percent fewer calls a day than they did in 1998.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important, Fidelity's customers seem happy when they move online. Last month, Fidelity climbed past Schwab to reach the top of J. D. Power and Associates' ranking of investor satisfaction with online trading services.</p>
        <p>The importance of pleasing the online audience is clear enough. From March to August, the number of American households making online trades grew 22 percent, according to the report. And investors are becoming more promiscuous: the percentage using more than one online broker doubled, to 38 percent, in six months, the report said. A chief reason was investor frustration during the stock market shocks of April.</p>
        <p>''The industry as a whole, under that type of duress, achieved much lower levels of satisfaction over all,'' said Nancy Salk, research director at J. D. Power. ''But Fidelity managed to drop less than some of its competitors. What has emerged as most important is service. If you don't deliver on customer service and information, regardless if they're paying $2 or $200, it doesn't matter.''</p>
        <p>Such studies do not take into account the returns of the mutual funds that are managed by Fidelity. While the results are certainly better than they were in 1996, Fidelity has an odd problem for a business so fixated on technology. During the run-up of technology stocks in 1998 and 1999, its growth funds did not keep pace with those of some of its more aggressive competitors, particularly Janus.</p>
        <p>Fidelity made heavy bets that doubled the technology weightings of some of its most prominent funds, but its moves were tame in comparison to Janus's, as was the performance of its growth funds.</p>
        <p>''The most significant factor, by far, behind the dip in our equity funds' relative peer performance can be summed up in three words: technology, technology, technology,'' said Robert C. Pozen, the Fidelity vice chairman who was chosen three years ago by Mr. Johnson to resurrect the firm's fund operations.</p>
        <p>Over all, performance has been solid, if not blazing, during Mr. Pozen's tenure. Fidelity's large-company funds, on average, beat 62 percent of their peers and gained 18.8 percent annually, well ahead of the 16 percent return of the S.&amp; P. 500, according to Morningstar. Given the jittery performance of the technology sector this year -- and that of Janus -- Fidelity's more cautious approach looks better in retrospect.</p>
        <p>''They don't have to shoot for the stars,'' said Eric Kobren, a former Fidelity marketing executive who publishes Fidelity Insight, a newsletter that tracks the company. At the post-modern Fidelity, consistency is king.</p>
        <p>''What they can't afford to do,'' Mr. Kobren added, ''is strike out.''</p>
        <p>The Message  An Old-Line Firm  Gets a Digital Face</p>
        <p>Much about Fidelity has not changed in the five decades since its founding. It is still privately held and has no plans to go public in the foreseeable future. It is still run by a man named Edward Crosby Johnson. And Peter Lynch, the legendary, puff-haired former fund manager is still Fidelity's public face.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lynch, now a vice chairman, has not managed money in years, and a more apt representative of the new Fidelity might be Thomas Tullis, the chief of the usability labs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tullis is not your typical suit. He is a bearded, benevolent-looking professorial type who speaks in thoughtful tones and dresses Silicon Valley casual. He holds eight patents, including No. 5,715,370, for ''Method and Apparatus for Extracting Text from a Structured Data File and Converting the Extracted Text to Speech.''</p>
        <p>''The Web has created a new set of rules or a new set of expectations related to usability,'' Mr. Tullis said earlier this year, during a speech at an I.B.M. conference on Web design.</p>
        <p>''Web pages have to be easier to use,'' he continued, ''than some of the alternatives that people might have available to them. Many people would agree now that Web pages need to be works of art as well. They need to be beautiful.''</p>
        <p>The Fidelity of old and the Fidelity of Mr. Tullis are both on display just around the corner from the company's headquarters. There, a digital kiosk lets investors communicate with their trillion-dollar, bionic investment firm.</p>
        <p>On the wall of the kiosk is a picture of Edward Crosby Johnson II. Through his old-fashioned circular eyeglasses, he stares down on automated-teller machines and digital display terminals. Nearby, posted on a monitor, is a letter from his son to Fidelity investors.</p>
        <p>''When my father founded this company in 1946, a 'Web site' was where you were likely to find a spider and a 'home page' was a section of the local newspaper,'' the younger Mr. Johnson wrote.</p>
        <p>''If my father could see the company today,'' the letter continued, ''he would marvel at what we've become.''</p>
