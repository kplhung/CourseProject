        <p>In the  end, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta  whose repeated resistance to raising property taxes helped bring Nassau County to the edge of fiscal ruin -- has turned to tax increases to help bail the county out.</p>

        <p>In the  end, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta  whose repeated resistance to raising property taxes helped bring Nassau County to the edge of fiscal ruin -- has turned to tax increases to help bail the county out.</p>
        <p>And a bitter end it was. After a long day in which lawmakers waited and fumed, Mr. Gulotta beat a state-imposed deadline for  submitting a four-year budget plan by a mere two minutes Friday night. Just before midnight he filed a proposal that calls for a  roughly 4 percent property tax increase next year, followed by increases of 3 percent in each of the next three years.</p>
        <p>Trying to pull the county back from the brink of bankruptcy and avoid a state takeover of its day-to-day finances, Mr. Gulotta proposed raising more than $40 million through new taxes and fees next year while cutting spending by about $100 million. And to help plug a string of growing projected deficits in 2002, 2003 and 2004, he proposed three small, successive tax increases to raise about $16.5 million each.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the most thorough and sound, meaningfully structured budgets that has ever been submitted,'' Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, said after he filed the documents at 11:58 p.m. Friday with Rocco Iannarelli, the clerk of the County Legislature.</p>
        <p>The Democratic majority leader of the Legislature, Judith A. Jacobs, who had waited with growing irritation in the county offices for the plan, spent the wee hours of the morning sifting through the reams of documents. She said she was pleasantly surprised to see that Mr. Gulotta had proposed raising taxes, although she said she might call for larger tax increases to balance the budget.</p>
        <p>''Tom Gulotta is finally recovering from his 1992 post-traumatic-tax-increase syndrome,'' Ms. Jacobs said, recalling Mr. Gulotta's proposal that year for a double-digit tax increase, which nearly swept him out of office after one term. ''He finally has recognized that in order to stay whole, with expenditures going up, you do have to increase the revenue. It is a step that deserves notation for its hold on reality.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta's plan still contained a proposal to lay off more than 350 county workers, a plan that lawmakers in both parties -- concerned that the costs of a layoff would outweigh the savings -- had urged him to abandon from the moment he disclosed it on Sept. 5. And Ms. Jacobs and others said the plan was too short on specifics to tell whether it would work.</p>
        <p>Anthony P. Giustino, the president of Local 830 of the Civil Service Employees Association, which has 11,000 members, including 6,000 county employees, said, ''He ought to have the guts to tell the taxpayers what parks are going to be closed, what sewage plants will not be manned properly and what roads will not be plowed.''</p>
        <p>The plan was also delivered early today by a county deputy sheriff to Richard M. Kessel, a member of the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, the state panel whose members were appointed in May by Gov. George E. Pataki and other state officials to help Nassau through a bailout plan that includes $105 million in state aid and the restructuring of the county's $2.6 billion debt.</p>
        <p>''It will be distributed to our board  on Monday,'' Mr. Kessel said, ''and our board members and staff will undergo a comprehensive review of both next year's budget and the four-year plan.''</p>
        <p>Much in the proposal had already been disclosed in recent weeks by Mr. Gulotta, who told lawmakers he would call for raising property taxes by 4 percent, laying off more than 350 county workers and merging 15 county departments as part of his plan to wipe out a roughly $140 million deficit next year. But legislative leaders of both parties had said they were skeptical about $50 million worth of his spending cuts, saying they needed more details.</p>
        <p>The plan submitted last night provided some of them. It set the proposed 2001 budget at $2.213 billion, less than 1 percent smaller than this year's $2.218 billion adopted budget. It showed spending increases in the three following years, but more conservative revenue projections than in the past, particularly for sales taxes.</p>
        <p>Robert W. Lazaro, a spokesman for Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican legislative minority leader, said today that he would not comment until his caucus had a chance to study Mr. Gulotta's submissions.</p>
        <p>''From what I understand it is a massive amount of paper,'' Mr. Lazaro said. ''Our budget people will start today to begin to look at it. They will ask a lot of questions during the legislative committee hearings during the week of Sept. 25, of the department heads and administration officials.''</p>
        <p>In a preliminary analysis an hour after receiving Mr. Gulotta's four-year plan, Ms. Jacobs, the Democratic leader, said it provided too few details on spending cuts, a charge often repeated over the last 10 days as Mr. Gulotta disclosed parts of the  plan.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs said it was now up to the County Legislature, which has a 10-to-9 Democratic majority, to amend the plans, most likely by exchanging the layoffs of union employees for larger tax increases than those proposed by Mr. Gulotta.</p>
        <p>Specifically, aides to Ms. Jacobs said, the four-year plan includes $72 million in spending cuts with no additional information on how that number can be achieved.</p>
        <p>They said they were also troubled by $50 million in savings, beginning in 2003, that Mr. Gulotta said would result from the county's ceasing to share a portion of its sales tax revenue with its three towns and two cities. Legislators in both parties said state approval is needed for such a move.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs said state permission would also be needed for Mr. Gulotta's plan to save $7 million by requiring the county's school districts to refund real estate taxes to homeowners who successfully challenge their bills. Those costs are currently borne by the county.</p>
        <p>''The questions are readily apparent, and the answers readily are not,'' said Darren Bloch, chief of staff to the legislative majority.  ''Does it mean the answers aren't in the thousands of pages of paper provided by the administration? No. But it means these are very simple broad issue questions whose answers are not as easily found by people who have been at least familiar with these issues for months.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta's budget for 2001 is only the second proposal to cut overall spending in the last decade, and comes despite a 24 percent rise in county-mandated costs for social service programs like Medicaid or public assistance.</p>
        <p>On the revenue side, Mr. Gulotta apparently proposed not a single one-time source of revenue, like selling county land or property. His opponents have criticized such one-time deals in the past.</p>
        <p>Instead, he proposed raising $18.1 million through a roughly 4 percent increase in county property taxes -- a rise that would cost the average household $33 next year. He also proposed fee increases for tickets to shows, concerts or sporting events in county arenas, as well as for hotel and motel stays, cabana rentals, gun permits and parking fines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta's 2001 estimate for sales tax revenues -- the county's largest single source, making up 39 percent of its income -- is more than $809 million. He budgeted $11 million for overtime costs at the county jail, in East Meadow -- a more realistic figure than last year, when he proposed just $5.1 million, though overtime costs for correction officers in 1999 hit $16 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta's proposed cuts in spending are partly offset by the state bailout, which provided $25 million in aid for next year while saving the county $88 million in reduced debt service costs because NIFA is refinancing the county's $2.6 billion debt load.</p>
        <p>The biggest spending cuts Mr. Gulotta has proposed are likely to draw more criticism than they already have. Most notably, perhaps, the budget assumes $20 million in savings from contracts Mr. Gulotta has not yet secured with the county's three law enforcement unions: $9 million from the Police Benevolent Association, $7 million from the Detectives Association Inc., and $3 million from the Sheriff Officers Association. The question is whether tentative concessions by those unions are larger than the costs, given that Mr. Gulotta is proposing double-digit raises for all of the officers.</p>
        <p>''I got a problem with the raises,'' Mr. Schmitt, the Republican leader,  said. ''I'm going to be looking at that real close. I just don't think that with the specter of a control board, the county on the brink of fiscal collapse, the county executive recommending tax increases and C.S.E.A. layoffs, that now is the time to consider 22 percent raises for the best but the most highly paid police department in the United States.''</p>
