        <p>There may have been a sweeter place to spend the first morning of the Olympic Games. But it was not readily apparent from the sun-drenched bleachers at Bondi Beach, where a sellout crowd of 10,000 whooped it up on the opening day of women's beach volleyball.</p>
        <p>With thumping rock music, wisecracking announcers, and the hedonistic atmosphere of Sydney's most famous beach as a backdrop, it was easy to forget that professional beach volleyball is a sport, not a spectacle.</p>
        <p>But the crowd grew more serious when the third-seeded American team suddenly found itself in a duel with a much-lower-seeded team from Australia. The Americans, Jennifer Johnson-Jordan and Annett Davis, had been expected to walk over their opponents, Annette Huygens Tholen and Sarah Straton.</p>
        <p>After a fast start, though, the Americans began losing points to the agile and aggressive Australians.</p>
        <p>Drawing strength from the delirious fans, Huygens Tholen and Straton surged back from 13-10 to 13-13. Johnson-Jordan and Davis kept their cool and served out the next two points to win, 15-13.</p>
        <p>''They were breathing down our necks, so we had to be patient,'' Davis said afterward. ''The Aussies did an awesome job.''</p>
        <p>Davis, 26, was playing in front of her father, Cleveland Buckner, a former basketball player with the Knicks.</p>
        <p>Also watching nervously from the stands was Johnson-Jordan's father, Rafer Johnson, who won a gold medal in the decathalon at the Rome Olympics in 1960 and lighted the torch at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.</p>
        <p>''When I first got out there, it was like a dream, an out-of-body experience,'' said Johnson-Jordan. ''But then I settled down.''</p>
        <p>The same can't be said of the crowd, which cheered, sang, mamboed, and gloried in the azure skies and brisk breezes of Bondi Beach. Beach volleyball became one of the most popular Olympic sports in its debut in Atlanta in 1996, even though the matches were played on an artificial beach miles from the ocean.</p>
        <p>Play it on an actual beach -- with actual surfers riding the waves just beyond the grandstand -- and beach volleyball takes on the characteristics of an outdoor rock concert on a blissful day.</p>
        <p>''It's really more a carnival than a sporting event,'' said Gerard Hines, 38, who traveled from his home 400 miles southwest of Sydney to attend the opening round. ''Being Australian and being beach lovers, we had to be here.''</p>
        <p>The Sydney Olympic committee raised the hackles of locals a few months ago when it closed off a large section of Bondi Beach to erect the giant temporary arena. Claiming that the structure would damage the beach and disrupt the neighborhood, a few activists even buried themselves up to their necks in sand to block bulldozers from moving around sand to support the building.</p>
        <p>Today, some local residents strolled by to scowl in the general direction of the arena. ''I'd be happy not to have this thing on my doorstep because I don't want to be woken up by silly P.A. announcements every morning,'' said Deborah Boyle, 45, a Web-site producer who lives in an apartment facing the beach.</p>
        <p>But for the most part, the bitterness washed away like a sand castle at high tide. Other residents said they were happy to play host to an Olympic event. And the athletes competed with each other to lavish praise on the site.</p>
        <p>''The fact that it is on a natural beach is just fabulous,'' said Holly McPeak, the captain of the other American team. McPeak, with teammate Misty May, dispatched Martina Hudcova and Tereza Tobiasova of the Czech Republic, 15-5, in 22 minutes.</p>
        <p>The victory was important because May pulled abdominal muscles in a tournament last summer and had been sidelined until five days ago. She said she felt great, though the injury still hampered her footwork.</p>
        <p>Having survived today's elimination round, the American teams are among the 12 teams that will advance to the round of 16 teams. Under the somewhat unusual format adopted by these Olympics, the teams that lost today will have a second chance to advance, competing on Monday to fill the remaining four slots in the round of 16.</p>
        <p>Among the Americans' biggest competitors will be the formidable Brazilian team of Adriana Behar and Shelda Bede, who are seeded second. They dismissed Lina and Petia Yanchulova of Bulgaria, 15-3.</p>
        <p>During the match, Brazil's fans did their best to make Bondi Beach feel like a stand-in for Copacabana. Their unofficial cheerleader, a several-hundred-pound man nicknamed ''Bolla,'' or ball, led the crowd in clapping and dancing. He was accompanied by a trombonist known as d'Artagnan.</p>
        <p>At times, the announcer had to gently remind the Brazilians that the athletes were about to resume play. On this sun-kissed opening day at Bondi, even the players didn't seem to mind the distraction.</p>
