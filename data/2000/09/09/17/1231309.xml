        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Robert Wright (''The Peace That's Within Our Grasp,'' Op-Ed, Sept. 12) warns that a policy of United Nations peacekeeping in civil wars could undermine the organization's credibility and weaken its role internationally. Yet armed intervention by those acting without United Nations authorization itself raises serious issues of legitimacy and international peace and security.</p>
        <p>One hundred and twelve countries, including Britain, France, Germany and Russia, recently signed a statute to criminalize genocide and certain other atrocities, even if committed in ''internal'' conflicts, and to establish a permanent court to help assure prosecution of violators. Ratification of the statute and support of the court by the United States could deter conduct that might otherwise give rise to future interventions, and would legitimately strengthen the hand of international law without undermining the credibility or legitimacy of the United Nations.</p>
