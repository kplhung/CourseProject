        <p>Officials at Historic Richmond Town, a 100-acre historic village with dozens of 18th- and 19th-century buildings, concede that traffic congestion is severe at the nearby intersection of Richmond Hill Road and Richmond Road.

        <p>The bridge, built in 1845, spans tiny Richmond Creek, which flows into a duck pond on the Richmond Town grounds. It also supports a narrow segment of Richmond Hill Road, where cars often wait in a line that stretches dangerously from the intersection with Richmond Road to the start of a steep, blind curve.</p>

        <p>Officials at Historic Richmond Town, a 100-acre historic village with dozens of 18th- and 19th-century buildings, concede that traffic congestion is severe at the nearby intersection of Richmond Hill Road and Richmond Road. But they fear that the city might try to fix the problem by demolishing Staten Island's only arched fieldstone bridge.</p>
        <p>The bridge, built in 1845, spans tiny Richmond Creek, which flows into a duck pond on the Richmond Town grounds. It also supports a narrow segment of Richmond Hill Road, where cars often wait in a line that stretches dangerously from the intersection with Richmond Road to the start of a steep, blind curve.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the city Department of Transportation, Tom Cocola, said the department was hiring an engineering firm to create a plan to improve flow through the intersection by reconstructing Richmond Hill Road. He said the department would award a $295,000 contract on Thursday to the Daniel Frankfurt &amp; Parsons Transportation group, an engineering firm, to do the study.</p>
        <p>But Judith McMillen, director of education at Historic Richmond Town, said widening the road would necessitate damaging all or part of Towne Bridge, as she referred to it, which would cause ''an irreplaceable loss of our heritage.''</p>
        <p>As to whether the bridge might be removed, Mr. Cocola said, ''It may or may not happen.'' He said any proposed change to Richmond Hill Road would undergo an extensive review, and the engineers had been told ''to meet with everyone who is affected by this project, including Richmond Town.''</p>
