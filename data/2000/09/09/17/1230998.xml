        <p>Nothing Like It  In the World</p>
        <p>The Men Who Built</p>
        <p>the Transcontinental Railroad, 1863-1869.</p>
        <p>By Stephen E. Ambrose.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 431 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster. $28.</p>
        <p>FOR sheer engineering gee-whiz, the American transcontinental railroad of the 19th century ranks with the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids of Giza and the Panama Canal. Today's traveler cannot drink in a single sweeping view of the sinuous line of steel stretching from Omaha to Sacramento, but in its entirety it is still a marvel for the ages.</p>
        <p>Its importance in American history cannot be overstated. The 2,000-mile line was the economic umbilical cord that finally linked the mother states of the East with the fledgling California on the West, beginning the end of the frontier struggle against mountains, deserts and rivers, and threatening American Indian culture as well as native species like the bison and gray wolf. The political and cultural impact of the transcontinental railroad is felt to this day; belief in the expensive antimissile dream Star Wars had its roots in the nation's boundless optimism, born with the Pacific railroad, that with money and determination it could build anything to solve any problem.</p>
        <p>The epic story of the railroad's construction between 1863 and 1869 has been told time and again, most recently in David Haward Bain's monumental ''Empire Express'' (1999). Now Stephen E. Ambrose offers a richly readable new work, ''Nothing Like It in the World.'' On its smaller, more accessible scale, Ambrose's book compares well with Bain's, although Ambrose of course cannot match Bain for argument-settling detail, especially about financial matters.</p>
        <p>As he did in his World War II oral histories and in ''Undaunted Courage,'' his chronicle of the Lewis and Clark expedition, Ambrose focuses on the lives of ordinary people rather than on those of movers and shakers. But he does not slight the powerful pirates who created the Credit Mobilier for the Union Pacific Railroad and the Contract and Finance Company for the Central Pacific Railroad -- granting lucrative construction contracts to themselves while nearly bankrupting the railroads they owned.</p>
        <p>Ambrose ably retells the familiar stories of the railroad visionaries Theodore Judah in the West and Grenville Dodge in the East, and of the Daddy Warbuckses who commanded the project from both ends. They were the Big Four of the eastward-bound Central Pacific in California: Leland Stanford, Collis P. Huntington, Charles Crocker and Mark Hopkins. They were also Thomas Durant, Oakes Ames and Oliver Ames of the Union Pacific, building westward from Omaha. Abraham Lincoln is present, too, as a farsighted railroad lawyer before the Civil War, and Brigham Young, Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman also make appearances.</p>
        <p>The builders ran the project as a war -- a war between two competing railroads to lay as much track as possible before meeting at a central point undetermined in the beginning. Like a war, the project needed government financing, in huge federal loans and land grants. Like a war, it needed to be run like an army, with military discipline in the ranks. And like a war, the project offered immense possibilities for financial chicanery. (That officers of the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific were deeply crooked there is no doubt, but Ambrose gives them some benefit of the doubt: in the beginning they were the only ones willing to risk their fortunes, and in the end the government was paid back every penny for every bond it issued. It was the small investor who was bilked, the worker whose pay was shorted.)</p>
        <p>Most of all, the project needed many thousands of workers. ''Nearly everything was done by muscle power,'' Ambrose writes. ''The transcontinental railroad was the last great building project to be done mostly by hand.'' Handcarts moved the dirt from cuts and to fills. Horses and mules, black powder and nitroglycerine helped, but it was mostly men with sledges and drills, mauls and picks who did the job, working under the burning sun, through choking snows and never-ending rain, and in tunnels blasting their way through unyielding granite at inches a day. They also had to defend themselves against Indians who saw their way of life disappearing.</p>
        <p>The workers came from all over -- demobilized Union and Confederate soldiers; former slaves; new Irish, Cornish and German immigrants; Mormons from Salt Lake City; and especially the courageous, disciplined Chinese, whose efficient, self-effacing teamwork Ambrose's heart most belongs to. It must have been frustrating for him, a master at gathering firsthand stories of ordinary folks and weaving them into powerful eyewitness narratives, to discover that the Chinese had left virtually no letters or personal accounts about the project. Ambrose had to rely on other sources, like the journalism of the time, which fortunately was both copious and colorful, and some obscure but revealing nuggets:</p>
        <p>''In the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley, there are Chinese-English and English-Chinese phrase books from 1867. The English speakers learned how to say in Chinese: 'Can you get me a good boy? He wants $8 per month? He ought to be satisfied with $6. I think he is very stupid. Come at 7 every morning. Go home at 8 every night. Light the fire. Sweep the rooms. Wash the clothes. Wash the windows. Wash the floor. Sweep the stairs. Trim the lamps. I want to cut his wages.' Two phrases that never appear in the English-Chinese book are: 'How are you?' and 'Thank you.' ''</p>
        <p>Ambrose's scholarship seems impeccable, supported by copious notes and an extensive bibliography. He writes a brisk, colloquial, straightforward prose that not only is easy to read but also bears the reader on shoulders of wonder and excitement, especially late in the book as the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railheads grow ever closer. (Occasionally, however, the style can become artless, and even employ teenage locutions like ''for sure'' and ''for real.'' In one place Ambrose refers to the Big Four as ''these guys.'')</p>
        <p>From time to time Ambrose makes the kind of connection only he can. A cold spell in Utah froze the ground solid two feet deep, so that workmen could not use picks or shovels but had to loosen the earth with charges of black powder. ''In Europe in World War II,'' Ambrose writes in a footnote, ''American G.I.'s used their hand grenades, or dynamite charges, to blast frozen earth apart so that they could dig foxholes.''</p>
        <p>''Nothing Like It in the World'' may be a popular history, but it is also a complex one, and the several maps of the route as well as a section of contemporary photographs greatly aid the reader's understanding of its builders' grand accomplishment. For the most part, the route of Interstate 80 from Omaha to Sacramento closely follows the original railroad grade as the 19th-century surveyors laid it out. Even with electronic instruments modern technicians could not have done better.</p>
