        <p>It was the kind of inning the Mets have seen too often this month. They had the bases loaded in the first inning tonight, with one run in, nobody out and their 5-6-7 hitters coming up. And they squandered the opportunity.</p>
        <p>Two shallow flyouts. A fielder's choice grounder.</p>
        <p>The Mets then broke through in the later innings and clobbered the Montreal Expos at lifeless Olympic Stadium, 10-4.</p>
        <p>''Early in the game, we got opportunities to score more than one run and we didn't do it,'' said Edgardo Alfonzo, who was 3 for 5 with a home run and four runs batted in. ''Everybody stayed focused. It seemed like before, everybody got down. When we played at home and got opportunities like that and we couldn't do anything, everybody was kind of like, there we go again.''</p>
        <p>There they go again, scoring 10 runs for the third time in a week. The Mets started September mired in offensive futility and lost 8 of their first 10 games in the month. They have won five of seven since, and they lead the Arizona Diamondbacks by five games in the National League wild-card race. Any combination of 11 Mets victories and Arizona losses will clinch it.</p>
        <p>The lineup is hitting again -- except for the All-Star catcher Mike Piazza, who rested tonight -- but the starting pitching has led the Mets to this point. They still trail the Atlanta Braves by two games in the N.L. East, but they travel to Atlanta for three games starting Monday with a starting staff that has a 3.31 earned run average this month.</p>
        <p>Rick Reed improved to 10-5 tonight, after deciding to forgo his between-starts bullpen session for the first time in his career. He gave no real reason for that -- ''I just wasn't into it,'' he said -- but the result was a solid six-inning, two-run performance in which he issued no walks. The Mets were blown out in Reed's previous start, but now they are sure of themselves again.</p>
        <p>''We knew it was a matter of time before we came out of it,'' Reed said. ''This is something I don't like to bring up, but last year at the end of September is when we had our little slump. This year, it's the beginning of September. It seems like guys are coming out of it. We're starting to pitch a little better, starting to put runs on the board. Hopefully, that's all behind us.''</p>
        <p>The Mets had another reason to be optimistic tonight, despite their first-inning failures. Montreal's Dustin Hermanson, who dominated them here two months ago, appeared hittable from the start. He had neither his best fastball nor his best slider, and the Mets had nine hits and seven runs off him over three and two-thirds innings.</p>
        <p>Three of the Mets' starting pitchers -- Bobby J. Jones, Al Leiter and Glendon Rusch -- are virtually helpless at the plate; their combined batting average is .051. But the other two starters, Reed and Mike Hampton, are decent hitters.</p>
        <p>Reed, who said he almost never takes batting practice, singled to right field with a runner on and two out in the fourth. Hermanson was following a risky battle plan -- as Leiter showed on Friday, when he gave up two crushing two-out hits to the pitcher, dooming the Mets to defeat.</p>
        <p>''Yesterday, we gave a game away we should have won,'' Mets catcher Todd Pratt said. ''Today, we bore down a little bit. I just didn't feel around the clubhouse the desperation there was 10 days ago.''</p>
        <p>Reed's hit helped spoil things for Hermanson, who also had center fielder Peter Bergeron to blame. Benny Agbayani followed Reed with a fly ball to center that the charging Bergeron dropped. Jay Payton scored, giving the Mets a 2-0 lead. The inning was still going, and for Hermanson it kept getting worse.</p>
        <p>Darryl Hamilton singled in another run, and it was 3-0. Alfonzo lined a three-run homer to left; 6-0. Robin Ventura followed with a homer to right. It was 7-0, and a walk and a double finally earned Hermanson his exit.</p>
        <p>When Reed was removed for a pinch-hitter in the seventh, the Mets led, 8-2. All that remained were a few heated moments.</p>
        <p>Reliever Rick White drilled the Expos' best player, Vladimir Guerrero, in the ribs in the seventh. In the ninth, Expos reliever Jeremy Powell threw a ball behind Matt Franco, getting a warning from the home plate umpire, Chris Guccione.</p>
        <p>''We weren't trying to hit him at all,'' Pratt said. ''I repect Vlady, but you have to pitch him inside; just that one was way too inside. But at that point there was no way we're trying to put guys on base. We have no reason to start something like that.''</p>
        <p>Powell was pitching after the ejection of reliever Steve Kline, who argued a call at first base when Payton was ruled safe on an infield hit in the eighth. After he was tossed, Kline hurled his glove toward the first base umpire, Ian Lamplugh, and screamed at him from the dugout.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Mets right fielder DARRYL HAMILTON had two hits and is 9 for 19 this month. He tried a new timing mechanism at the plate in early batting practice on Friday, and he is pleased with the results. ''I'm pretty much very quiet at the plate right now,'' Hamilton said. ''I feel really comfortable right now.''</p>
