      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Though the cover-up of a deadly crime propels the plot of DIAMOND DOGS (Little, Brown, $23.95), Alan Watt's dark, sparklingly written first novel, an emotionally fraught father-son relationship gives the book its depth. In his hometown, Carmen, a dingy Las Vegas suburb, Neil Garvin is a star high school quarterback -- and a notorious bully. Driving while drunk one night after a party, Neil accidentally hits and kills a lone pedestrian, who turns out to be a shy classmate Neil had roughed up and humiliated earlier that evening. After Neil hides the body, the story transforms into something far more complex than how a criminal covers his tracks. The local sheriff is none other than Neil's father -- a man who appears to be respectable, but at home terrorizes Neil with threats and violence, and whom Neil blames for chasing off his mother years earlier. Yet when this law enforcer discovers Neil's predicament, he coolly and methodically conceals the crime -- thus unhappily bonding Neil to him even further. Watt, a former stand-up comic, injects Neil's numb, guilt-ridden voice with a subtle, deadpan humor and slyly evokes telling details -- Diamond Dogs,'' for example, describes rabid Neil Diamond fans like Neil's father, disappointed middle-aged men who live for ''the greatest lounge act on earth.'' Despite some minor flaws in the pacing (the resolution involving Neil's mother feels slightly forced), Watt delivers a moving, multifaceted story that sharply explores the legacy of violence, distorted forms of love and the high cost of genuine freedom.</p>
