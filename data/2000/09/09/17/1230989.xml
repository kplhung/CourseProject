        <p>OF the making of lists there is no end. Now that it is possible to speak of the 20th century as a whole, it seems irresistible to compile and swap lists of our favorite poems (or novels or plays or movies) of the last 100 years. Which works are indispensable? Which stand the best chance of enduring? Which do we simply like the best? Which have come to mean the most to us? To assemble a list of great 20th-century poems would, if it did nothing else, direct attention to important works. It might also stimulate discussion, even controversy. And as I conceived it, the project would record the taste of some of our leading poets surveying the monuments of what Henry Luce called the American Century.</p>
        <p>How to proceed? As series editor of ''The Best American Poetry'' since its inception in 1988, I opted for the unscientific but not entirely arbitrary method of polling the annual anthology's guest editors. Each year an American poet selects the contents from the previous year's literary magazines. For the inaugural volume John Ashbery overcame his diffidence (''Couldn't we call it 'O.K. Poems of 1988'?'') to select the 75 poems he liked the best. Since then Donald Hall, Jorie Graham, Mark Strand, Charles Simic, Louise Glck, A. R. Ammons, Richard Howard, Adrienne Rich, James Tate, John Hollander, Robert Bly and Rita Dove have taken their turn as the volume's guest editor.</p>

        <p>OF the making of lists there is no end. Now that it is possible to speak of the 20th century as a whole, it seems irresistible to compile and swap lists of our favorite poems (or novels or plays or movies) of the last 100 years. Which works are indispensable? Which stand the best chance of enduring? Which do we simply like the best? Which have come to mean the most to us? To assemble a list of great 20th-century poems would, if it did nothing else, direct attention to important works. It might also stimulate discussion, even controversy. And as I conceived it, the project would record the taste of some of our leading poets surveying the monuments of what Henry Luce called the American Century.</p>
        <p>How to proceed? As series editor of ''The Best American Poetry'' since its inception in 1988, I opted for the unscientific but not entirely arbitrary method of polling the annual anthology's guest editors. Each year an American poet selects the contents from the previous year's literary magazines. For the inaugural volume John Ashbery overcame his diffidence (''Couldn't we call it 'O.K. Poems of 1988'?'') to select the 75 poems he liked the best. Since then Donald Hall, Jorie Graham, Mark Strand, Charles Simic, Louise Glck, A. R. Ammons, Richard Howard, Adrienne Rich, James Tate, John Hollander, Robert Bly and Rita Dove have taken their turn as the volume's guest editor.</p>
        <p>I asked -- begged, nagged and cajoled -- each of them to name his or her top 15 American poems of the 20th century. Eager to ease their task, I gave the editors maximum latitude in how they defined ''best,'' ''American'' and ''20th century.'' Both Auden (born in England, moved to New York) and Eliot (born in St. Louis, moved to London) were deemed eligible. The lists were to be printed as a special feature of ''The Best American Poetry 2000,'' edited by Rita Dove.</p>
        <p>Not everyone was enthusiastic. Adrienne Rich declined to participate. Louise Glck, protesting that she could not ''prefer merely 15'' poems, offered a statement in lieu of a list. ''The culling of a century is not the culling of a year's uncollected work,'' she wrote. ''It is a culling of greatness. And in the 20th century, a great deal of greatness. It seems to me not only impossible to choose so few but also misleading, false, to extend a problematic terminology: there can't be, I think, the best of the great.'' Others felt on the contrary that a listing of their favorite poems was not simply an enjoyable parlor game but almost a moral obligation. Simply put, there are great poems and we should name them and by naming them help to perpetuate them and gain them new readers, new life.</p>
        <p>Eventually 12 participants (including me) turned in their lists. Some did it with customary dispatch. From Charles Simic and A. R. Ammons I had the lists by a return fax in one case and an impromptu phone call in the other. Others put up a struggle. ''I hate the Millennium,'' Ashbery groused. ''It means more work.''</p>
        <p>Ashbery chose Wallace Stevens's ''Chocorua to Its Neighbors'' rather than a better-known Stevens title in part because as a Harvard undergraduate he had written a paper on it for F. O. Matthiessen. With Borodin blaring in the background, Mark Strand called me to debate the merits of two other Stevens poems -- The Idea of Order at Key West'' and ''The Comedian as the Letter C'' -- before settling on the latter. James Tate luxuriated in the right to revise his choices: ''O'Hara and Auden are out, Edson and Plath in,'' he phoned. Even after eliminating ''poems that I admire, written by my classmates and closest friends,'' Donald Hall agonized over reducing his list from 22 to 15.</p>
        <p>Several judges could not resist listing a 16th choice or an honorable mention of works that barely missed the cut. Robert Bly could not make up his mind between two William Carlos Williams poems. Jorie Graham was undecided to the end on whether Frost's ''Home Burial'' or his ''West-Running Brook'' made the stronger claim. Characteristically eschewing the road more taken, Richard Howard gave the names of 16 poets but opted to cite the titles not of individual poems but of ''the books in which their preferred poems are to be found.''</p>
        <p>Acknowledging that his own taste is constantly evolving, Strand prefaced his selections by remarking, ''These are poems I may not love as much as I once did, but I remain loyal to my feelings.'' Jorie Graham disavowed ''terms such as 'indispensable' or 'essential' ''; she was declaring her favorites, not universalizing her taste. John Hollander provided alternatives in case any of his selections failed our virtually nonexistent eligibility requirements. Some, like Ammons, Bly and Dove, kept in mind the exigencies of length that govern the making of an anthology. Others, liberated by the notion that this anthology may exist only as the Platonic conception of itself, elected to go with the whole of certain book-length poems, such as Pound's ''Cantos'' and Eliot's ''Four Quartets,'' not to mention James Merrill's ''Changing Light at Sandover'' (560 pages) and Ashbery's ''Flow Chart'' (216 pages).</p>
        <p>And who won? When the ballots were counted, Frost received the most votes, 12. Every ballot except Ashbery's included a Frost poem. Simic chose two: ''Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening'' and that magnificent parable of pitiless nature, ''Design.'' Next came Elizabeth Bishop, with 11 mentions. Hart Crane and Wallace Stevens shared third place (10 votes apiece) followed by T. S. Eliot and William Carlos Williams (9). Marianne Moore (7), James Merrill (6), Ashbery himself (6), W. H. Auden (5) and Ezra Pound (5) rounded out the top 10. Only six living poets -- Ammons, Ashbery, Gwendolyn Brooks, Kenneth Koch, Robert Creeley and Richard Wilbur -- made it onto the composite list of 32 poets whose work was nominated by at least two editors.</p>
        <p>When it came to specific poems, Eliot's ''Waste Land,'' Crane's ''Voyages'' and Auden's ''In Praise of Limestone'' led the field. Each was listed four times. To that visionary company may be added Crane's ''Bridge,'' Eliot's ''Little Gidding'' and Merrill's ''Book of Ephraim,'' as these poems (or the longer poems of which they are self-contained units) also received four votes each. Two poems by William Carlos Williams -- Spring and All'' and ''Asphodel, That Greeny Flower'' -- appeared on three ballots, as did John Berryman's ''77 Dream Songs.''</p>
        <p>In the end, however, it is not consensus but variation within consensus that may be the most appealing aspect of this list-making endeavor. The greatness of Frost and Bishop and Stevens may be widely recognized, but little agreement exists as to which of their individual poems is paramount. No fewer than nine different poems by Bishop, and eight different poems by both Frost and Stevens, were cited by our judges.</p>
        <p>The individual lists -- which I maintain are more interesting and more useful than any composite we might forge -- appear in ''The Best American Poetry 2000.'' Looking them over, one may reasonably expect a bias in favor of poems from the first three-quarters of the century. With greater distance comes greater certitude. To simplify or, rather, to remove one set of complications from their task, three editors (Hall, Howard, Strand) went so far as to limit themselves to deceased poets. Here again Ashbery proved an exception. Six of his 15 choices are currently active. Rita Dove chose one of them -- Christopher Edgar's ''Birthday'' -- for ''The Best American Poetry 2000.'' Eliot and ''The Waste Land'' are among Ashbery's also-rans.</p>
        <p>The beauty of list-making is that anyone can play. I can see assembling a completely different panel -- with, say, Anne Carson, Billy Collins, Robert Creeley, Robert Hass, Carolyn Kizer, Kenneth Koch, Yusef Komunyakaa, W. S. Merwin, J. D. McClatchy, Heather McHugh, Alice Notley, Sharon Olds, Sonia Sanchez, Rosanna Warren and Charles Wright -- making the selections. The bench is deep in American poetry. That's one reason this assessment of American poetry's past may lead inevitably to growing confidence about what is to come.</p>
