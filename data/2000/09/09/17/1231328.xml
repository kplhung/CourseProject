        <p>THE 15-member European Union, it has often been said, resembles a bicycle. If it does not move forward, it falls. Right now, the bicycle is wobbling dangerously as Europe's persistent push for ever deeper integration wavers.</p>

        <p>THE 15-member European Union, it has often been said, resembles a bicycle. If it does not move forward, it falls. Right now, the bicycle is wobbling dangerously as Europe's persistent push for ever deeper integration wavers.</p>
        <p>The most visible recent sign of a reverse was a decision by 14 of the union's governments to abandon sanctions imposed on Austria for including Jorg Haider's rightist party in government. When the measures were imposed seven months ago, states from France to Germany hailed them as a sign that the union had passed from a purely economic grouping to a nascent political force bound by shared moral values. But the sanctions proved controversial, particularly in smaller European countries that felt they might one day get the Austrian treatment, and it now seems clear that Europe got ahead of itself.</p>
        <p>''We attempted to define ourselves as a club of values, but what was revealed in the end was that the values were weak and the political entity behind them even weaker,'' said Dominique Moisi, a French political analyst. For Jacques Chirac, whom Mr. Haider has repeatedly mocked as a ''pocket Napoleon,'' the lesson was particularly bitter.</p>
        <p>It is not only Mr. Haider who has taken note that Europe's political cohesion remains tenuous. So have financial markets. The euro, the shared currency introduced last year that is the most visible symbol of the Franco-German determination to move toward a United States of Europe, continues to plunge and has now lost 25 percent of its value. Three more years of this, one joke goes, and the currency will disappear altogether.</p>
        <p>There are several reasons for the euro's weakness. Among them are a broad conviction that the potential for growth in the United States is simply greater because of the country's relentless productivity gains and the pull of American equity markets. But a more basic reason is this: the spreading unease over what sort of political integration will accompany the birth of Euroland. As one worried German official put it, ''What is the political project that goes with economic union?''</p>
        <p>This question was inevitable. In the rush for economic union -- hurried to ensure that a Germany united in 1990 would be irrevocably bound to its European partners -- the fact that states adopting the euro were abandoning a central facet of sovereignty without any clear political plan was glossed over.</p>
        <p>But Europe now stands at an awkward crossroads. It needs to achieve greater political cohesion on everything from taxation to labor policy if the euro's credibility is to be salvaged. But, as the Austrian episode shows, Europe is also facing growing doubts among its various electorates over anything that smacks of a superstate. In Denmark, for example, where the Sept. 28 referendum on whether to join the euro is too close to call, any mention of eventual political union in a European federation is anathema.</p>
        <p>''There is a new hesitancy,'' said Karl Kaiser, a German sociologist. ''Small states are beginning to realize that European integration is indeed about integration and so you give up sovereignty. What they wanted was union with their national identity intact. But that is not so straightforward.''</p>
        <p>''Euromuddles,'' an American observer might be forgiven for muttering -- the same old story. It is true that the union has always grown through difficulties, and has always muddled through. It is also true that with the cold war won, the division of Europe ended, and three central European states already inside NATO, the United States has less reason for fretting about the old continent.</p>
        <p>But there is another side to the story that suggests the United States should pay heed. The European Union and its forebears have helped provide a half-century of peace and stability from which America has profited enormously. The union has now started an extraordinary experiment -- the introduction of a shared currency with no European government to back it -- that carries genuine, new risks. A crisis is not inconceivable.</p>
        <p>Imagine the following chain of events: Oil prices continue to rise. The euro, buffeted by a no vote in Denmark, continues to fall, raising still further the cost of imported oil. Inflation stirs; Europe's growth, currently looking sturdy, evaporates and a new recession looms before the planned disappearance on Jan. 1, 2002 of the national currencies of the 12 states that have adopted the euro.</p>
        <p>German public opinion, sullenly accepting of the euro until now, forms the conviction that the beloved symbol of their post-war nationhood, the Deutsche mark, has been pledged in a reckless political gamble, and rebels. The opposition Christian Democrats, solidly behind ever greater European integration under Helmut Kohl but now casting around desperately for a new platform, are tempted to back the rebellion.</p>
        <p>Populist, nationalist leaders, among them Mr. Haider, Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, and Pia Kjaersgaard in Denmark, find new grist for anti-European tirades. The age of the center-left in Europe gives way to an age of a new right. Any hope of real political integration flounders, leaving the euro a threatened orphan.</p>
        <p>It probably will not happen, at least not all at once. But even without such a crisis, the European Union is facing unusually difficult months. One factor weighing on the euro is the question of the European Union's enlargement. Who know where Europe ends and what geographical entity the euro will ultimately represent?</p>
        <p>MORE than a decade has now gone by since the cold war's end, but not one post-Communist European state has been brought into Europe's elite club. Without the membership of states like Poland or the Czech Republic, however, the quest of Europe's Founding Fathers for a continent at one and at peace looks hollow. The union accepts this fact, but does not know what to do about it.</p>
        <p>For if more members come in, and the current mechanisms of governance are not changed, the union is likely to become ungovernable. So France, which holds the union's rotating presidency, is looking at ways to streamline the union -- through more decision-making by qualified majorities and a reduction in the number of executive commissioners in Brussels. It is also trying to draft a European charter of the basic rights of the union's 375 million citizens. All this by the end of the year. To many, however, such moves smack again of a dilution of nationhood at a time when they are not ready for it.</p>
        <p>''Progress will be slow,'' conceded Klaus Leggewie, a German political analyst. ''But if you look at what was dreamed of for the union in the 1950's, we got it in the end. It took longer than expected, but we got there. In the same way we will get a charter of rights and majority voting and an expanded union. Not next year. But it will be done.''</p>
        <p>That is the optimistic view. If things go the other way, it is a safe bet that Europe will be hearing a lot more of the now buoyant Mr. Haider and his kind.</p>
