        <p>Four years ago, the United States sailing team arrived in Savannah, Ga., the Olympic sailing site for the 1996 Atlanta Games, with a seeming home-court advantage.

        <p>Four years ago, the United States sailing team arrived in Savannah, Ga., the Olympic sailing site for the 1996 Atlanta Games, with a seeming home-court advantage. American hopes to match or better their 1992 performance in Barcelona, Spain, where the squad carted off 9 medals in 10 classes, seemed well-founded.</p>
        <p>Someone forgot to tell the rest of the world, however, that the United States sailors were a force to be reckoned with. The final tally in Savannah was a bitter disappointment: only two bronze medals.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, the latest United States contingent will begin its quest for redemption in beautiful Sydney Harbor, with sailors in several of the 11 classes hoisting their sails in what should be a visibly sensational and highly competitive Olympic regatta.</p>
        <p>With four competitors in their 40's and seven more in their mid- to late-30's, the United States team is a veteran unit.</p>
        <p>And while no one expects it to repeat the stunning overall success in Barcelona, the Americans have realistic hopes to score medals in at least half of the sailing disciplines. Here's a breakdown of the respective classes and how the United States boat in each shapes up:</p>
        <p>49ER -- The Seattle brothers Jonathan and Charlie McKee honed their need for speed while competing in the wild Aussie 18 skiffs on Sydney Harbor, an experience that boosted their rise to prominence aboard the 49er, an athletic, double-trapeze boat making its Olympic debut. The McKees have both won Olympic medals -- Jonathan a gold in '84, Charlie a bronze in '88 -- and will need to vanquish the Australians Chris Nicholson and Daniel Phipps, among others, to score another.</p>
        <p>MEN'S 470 -- The Texan Paul Foerster, a three-time Olympian and the 1992 silver medalist in the Flying Dutchman class, and his crew, Bob Merrick of Rhode Island, are leading contenders in the men's two-man dinghy. So, too, are Tom King and Mark Turnbull, who are part of a deep, talented Australian squad, and the Frenchmen Philippe Gildas and Tanguy Cariou.</p>
        <p>STAR -- The reigning world champion, Mark Reynolds of San Diego, already has an Olympic silver and gold medal in his collection, and he would like to add another with his new crewman, Magnus Liljedahl. But the two-man keelboat class is stacked, with Torben Grael of Brazil, the Sydney native Colin Beashel, Gavin Brady of New Zealand and Ross MacDonald of Canada, among other notable skippers.</p>
        <p>SOLING -- To capture a medal in the three-man keelboat, the versatile, winning crew will have qualified in a tough fleet-racing series, and then triumphed in a boat-for-boat match racing tournament. The 1996 bronze medalist, Jeff Madrigali, now sailing with his fellow Californians Hartwell Jordan and Craig Healy is capable of doing so, but so is Jochen Schumann of Germany, Jesper Bank of Denmark and Rod Davis of New Zealand.</p>
        <p>WOMEN'S 470 -- The former America's Cup sailor J. J. Isler, a bronze medalist in the 470 in 1992, and Pease Glaser, who has come over from the Tornado class, are sentimental favorites. But Sofia Bekatorou and Emilia Tsoulfa from Greece, and Ruslana Taran and Olena Pakholchyk of Ukraine, should be the ones to beat.</p>
        <p>FINN -- Russ Silvestri of San Francisco campaigned in four Olympic trials before winning a spot on the team, at 38, earlier this year. But Mateusz Kusznierewicz of Poland, the defending Olympic champion, has dominated in this grueling single-handed dinghy for the last four years.</p>
        <p>EUROPE -- An Olympic bronze medalist in this solo dinghy in 1996, Courtenay Dey returned to the Europe after being ousted by J. J. Isler in the 470 trials. But with Dey's late start, Shirley Robertson of Britain, Kristine Roug of Denmark and Margriet Matthijsse from the Netherlands are the top pre-regatta hopefuls.</p>
        <p>MEN'S MISTRAL -- The sailboard class has a strong antipodean flavor with Lark Kleppich of Australia and Aaron McIntosh of New Zealand expected to battle Nikolaos Kaklamanakis of Greece for the top step on the podium. But Mike Gebhardt of Florida, a three-time Olympian, already has a bronze and silver, and would love to complete his collection with a gold.</p>
        <p>WOMEN'S MISTRAL -- Like Gephardt, Lanee Butler has dominated American boardsailing for many years. But the defending Olympic champion, Lee Lai-shan, who won Hong Kong's first-ever gold medal in 1996, is back. Barbara Kendall of New Zealand and Alessandra Sensini of Italy also provide serious competition.</p>
        <p>LASER -- In the popular open dinghy class, Robert Scheidt of Brazil is the Michael Jordan of Laser sailing, a dominant force who has won four world championships. But Ben Ainslie of Britain is not far behind. John Myrdal of Hawaii will need to sail the series of his life to break into the top ranks.</p>
        <p>TORNADO -- The Americans John Lovell and Charlie Ogletree hope to surpass their bronze-medal winning effort aboard the catamaran in 1996, but Darren Bundock and John Forbes of Australia, and the world champions, Roland Gaebler and Rene Schwall of Germany, surely have other ideas.</p>
