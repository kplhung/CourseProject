        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In evaluating educational reform (see Sara Mosle on Diane Ravitch's ''Left Back,'' Aug. 27), a few basic observations should be kept in mind.</p>
        <p>1. In 1840, when we and Scotland were the two most literate nations on earth, there were many ''one-room'' schools with 250 or more kids headed up by just one teacher and two assistants who helped the older stimulate, guide and control the younger.</p>
        <p>2. Sweden, now No. 1 in literacy, worries about readiness and brain development. Therefore, they let no child inside a school building before the age of 7 -- and then graduate them in just 9 years.</p>
        <p>3. In America, virtually all subject matter is (at all levels) anxiously memorized, then forgotten after the final exam is over. Teaching can't make integrated learning happen.</p>
        <p>4. What we need in the real world, as opposed to the ''credential world,'' are these (partly inborn) basic skills: the ability to speak, listen, think, read, write, calculate, push a few buttons, cooperate, ask relevant questions, borrow ideas and get help from others (in school, this is often called cheating).</p>
        <p>5. And finally, in addition to all we learn on the job, more than 1.5 million curious, confident, high-achieving and sociable home-schooled kids have demonstrated that the Prussian-derived, factory-oriented, teach 'em-test 'em, fear-provoking approaches of the mid-19th century may, in fact, be unnecessary or counterproductive.</p>
