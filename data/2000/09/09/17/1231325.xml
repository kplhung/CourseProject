        <p>''I'm afraid the whole world will be my enemy,'' the old man sang in Russian under the yellow street lights.</p>
        <p>A Soviet Jew, he was standing in Corona, a bursting ghetto of recently landed immigrants. His song was nearly three years ago. Once a factory manager, the old man, Sason Bodalov, had nothing then. No job, no English, breath stained with vodka and cheap cigarettes. Like many of his fellow Uzbekis, he was disoriented by his new bankrupt life in this Queens outpost.</p>
        <p>At that time, Mr. Bodalov didn't even have $15 for a visit to the Russian bathhouse that had sprung up out of the garbage room of a crumbling apartment building packed full of Jews and Muslims and Hindus.</p>
        <p>''Only the rich can afford the baths,'' he said then.</p>
        <p>But now, Mr. Bodalov, other Russians, Muslims, Hispanics, Hindus and even Americans come to the bathhouse for a swim, to be beaten with oak switches in the steam room, to drink vodka and eat herring, and make business at the bar. Mr. Bodalov now works as a jeweler on 47th Street in Manhattan. He has money for the baths.</p>
        <p>''The immigrants now do very, very well now, and it is a great American thing,'' said Alex Feldman, proprietor of the bathhouse, who proudly proclaims that he is the sole provider of baths to the unwashed masses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Feldman is a squat 58-year-old Ukrainian, slightly balding with large hands, a paunch and a thick slathered accent. He takes pride in the cleanliness of the bathhouse and that he has held his price steady at $15 for three years.</p>
        <p>''This neighborhood, not too rich,'' Mr. Feldman said over a beer and lamb. ''But now the people, they make the money. The price will be $20, and this is still the cheapest price in New York.''</p>
        <p>There are another half-dozen Russian- and Turkish-style bathhouses in the city: two in Manhattan, three in Brooklyn and another in Queens. But none can boast of a bar, a heated pool and the range of clientele that patronize the Forest Hills Spa, off the Long Island Expressway at Calloway and Otis Streets in the umbrage of the goliath Lefrak City housing complex.</p>
        <p>Forest Hills is two dozen blocks away, Mr. Feldman concedes, but he chose the name because people get funny ideas about Corona.</p>
        <p>''The problem is no one wants to leave their expensive cars on street.''</p>
        <p>Still, the cultured and the curious come.</p>
        <p>In the bar sits Efim Nezhinski, 63, a businessman who lives between New York and Moscow, with a stomach so large he swears he ate his wife. He sits with a man he calls Boris the Hairy Bear who eats much and speaks little.</p>
        <p>At the next table is Abram Tavarish, a severe-looking man with a smooth, egglike head, blue eyes, and a towel draped over his shoulders as though he were the Count of the Caucasians.</p>
        <p>''I was a guard in the gulags of Novo Kuznetsk,'' Mr. Tavarish said between gulps of Czech beer. ''Nothing but misery. My job was to shoot people.</p>
        <p>''But things are better here in America. Now I have money, and I come to the bathhouse only to shoot breeze.''</p>
