        <p>Rep James E Rogan faces tough re-election challenge in California from State Sen Adam Schiff; close and bitter showdown will be most expensive House race in nation this year, with candidates spending perhaps $10 million and outside groups spending more; Rogan's role as one of House Republican managers of Pres Clinton's impeachment has energized Democratic support for Schiff in increasingly Democratic district (M)</p>

        <p>The school auditorium was packed and sweaty, and an overflow line snaked out the door with a small-town feel.

        <p>The school auditorium was packed and sweaty, and an overflow line snaked out the door with a small-town feel. But the crowd had come to witness a big-time race, the first joint appearance of Representative James E. Rogan, one of the House Republican managers of the impeachment case against President Clinton, and his Democratic challenger, State Senator Adam Schiff.</p>
        <p>It was not a debate, exactly, just a series of answers to precirculated questions on topics like Medicare, Social Security, crime and education at a forum sponsored by several local chambers of commerce in this suburban Los Angeles district. But by the time the talking -- and the cheering and booing -- was over, it was easy enough to see why this close and bitter showdown will be the most expensive House race in the nation this year, with perhaps $10 million in spending by the candidates alone, plus more by outside groups.</p>
        <p>''Ro-GAN, Ro-GAN!'' the congressman's supporters chanted, while the challengers' partisans countered in near-sync with their candidate's name, ''It's time for a shift!''</p>
        <p>In fact, this once heavily Republican district, which includes Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena, has been in the process of a major shift.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schiff and Mr. Rogan, both former prosecutors, first ran against each other for the State Assembly in 1994, a race Mr. Rogan won before going on to Congress two years later. But the district has been going steadily more Democratic. And Mr. Rogan was first elected with just 50 percent of the vote, then re-elected with just 51 percent two years ago, well before his role in the impeachment case helped energize Democratic support for Mr. Schiff.</p>
        <p>''It's one of those races that's had the aura around it for such a long time, mostly because of Rogan's role in impeachment and Democratic frustrations with him last time,'' said John Kohut, senior editor of The Rothenberg Political Report, a Washington newsletter. ''Schiff came to the dance ready to go. He was already a pro, and he's had traction from the beginning. And the district has simply gone south for the G.O.P.''</p>
        <p>As of midsummer, the candidates themselves had raised a combined $7.5 million. They have been airing advertisements on cable television since May. The national parties and outside interest groups are beginning to pour in more money for advertisements and mailers, and the race is one of the handful of closely watched contests around the country that will determine whether the Democrats can take back the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>By the end of the last reporting period, June 30, Mr. Schiff had raised more money than even the most prominent House incumbents, except the Democratic minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, and Mr. Rogan himself, who had raised $4.6 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schiff's political consultant, Parke Skelton, took wry note of the interest in the race today by explaining that he had recently finished an interview with Norwegian national television. But in a more serious vein, he noted that Democratic registration in the district had increased by more than 6,300 since the March primary election, when Mr. Schiff narrowly beat Mr. Rogan on a blanket ballot, while Republicans had gained only about 2,400 new voters. Over all, Democratic registration exceeds Republican by about eight percentage points.</p>
        <p>''The only part of the district that's seeing a net increase in Republicans is Forest Lawn,'' Mr. Skelton said, referring to the famous cemetery-to-the-stars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogan's role in the impeachment trial has drawn national attention to Mr. Schiff and attracted big-name fund-raisers, including the recording and movie mogul David Geffen, who raised $135,000 for Mr. Schiff early on. But it has not been much of an issue here -- at least not until this week, when Mr. Rogan began running a television advertisement obliquely noting his role, saying, ''I made a lot of my Democrat friends angry when I supported impeachment.''</p>
        <p>Democrats pounced on that as a sign that Mr. Rogan might be worried about shoring up his base, or persuading swing voters angry at his stand to give him a second look. But his opponents were more irked that Mr. Rogan also used the advertisement to portray himself as opposing his fellow Republicans on some issues, like gun control and overhauling health maintenance organizations. Tonight when he said he was proud of ''yes, at times, even working with a Democrat president,'' there were derisive calls of ''Ha!'' from the crowd.</p>
        <p>But both candidates are aiming squarely for the middle ground, and tonight it was sometimes hard to tell their positions apart, though Mr. Rogan favors privatizing some Social Security investments while Mr. Schiff does not, and on health care Mr. Rogan clearly has something of a soft spot for business interests (who back him) while Mr. Schiff has a soft spot for labor unions (who back him).</p>
        <p>''We need to make sure there is a real patients' bill of rights, not just a trial lawyers' full employment system,'' said Mr. Rogan, who turns 43 next week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogan's father was a bartender who abandoned his mother, a convicted welfare cheat. Mr. Rogan went on to college at Berkeley and law school at the University of California, Los Angeles, and began his political career as a Democrat before switching parties more than a decade ago.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Schiff, 40, a graduate of Stanford and Harvard Law School who worked as a federal prosecutor before winning his State Senate seat in 1996, said, ''Too many of our seniors have to choose between buying food'' and medicine, without a prescription drug benefit for Medicare.</p>
        <p>A key battle is being fought over Armenian voters, perhaps 15 percent of the district's total and the biggest immigrant group driving demographic change here.</p>
        <p>This summer, the Armenian National Committee, the largest national organization of Armenians, endorsed Mr. Schiff, despite having twice backed Mr. Rogan, on the grounds that Mr. Schiff was more ''forward-looking.''</p>
        <p>''Everybody saw that as a big barometer,'' said Mr. Kohut, the political analyst.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogan's spokesman, Jeffrey L. Solsby, said the race was even.</p>
        <p>''But it's going to come down to a very close race,'' he said, ''and we're not taking any votes for granted.''</p>
