        <p>Keeping your cool while standing amid cascading water and rising flames would be a tough task for anyone, especially with the world watching.

        <p>Keeping your cool while standing amid cascading water and rising flames would be a tough task for anyone, especially with the world watching. Cathy Freeman, the Australian track star, acknowledged that her heart was pumping as she stood with the Olympic torch and lighted the caldron at the opening ceremony.</p>
        <p>''I have never felt emotion like that before,'' she said. ''I knew I was going to cry the moment I stepped into the arena with the Australian team. I was just emotionally overwhelmed by the honor of being chosen.''</p>
        <p>Freeman said that it was difficult to stay quiet about the Olympic-sized secret -- for three years.</p>
        <p>Opening Ratings Drop</p>
        <p>The opening ceremony generated a 16.1 Nielsen rating Friday night for NBC, down 32 percent from 23.6 from Atlanta in 1996 when the network carried the ceremony live. All programming from Sydney will be carried on tape delay.</p>
        <p>The rating surpassed NBC's rating for the two previous Summer Games from outside the United States. The first night of the Sydney Games exceeded the 1992 rating in Barcelona, Spain, by 17 percent and the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea, by 6 percent.</p>
        <p>''Who wouldn't be happy in this age of niche TV to beat other domestic Summer Olympics?'' said Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports. ''It's beyond what I ever expected.'' The Sydney rating was lower than Atlanta's ''because it's an offshore taped Olympics,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Friday night's rating peaked at 19.9 from 10:30 to 11 p.m. Eastern, the period when Cathy Freeman lighted the Olympic caldron. The night started with a 15.9 rating from 8 to 8:30 and jumped to 19.1 at 9 o'clock. From 11 to midnight, the rating settled down to 17.8.</p>
        <p>Each rating point equals 1.01 million television households.</p>
