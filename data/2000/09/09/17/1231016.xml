        <p>THE CLOSE</p>
        <p>A Young Woman's First Year</p>
        <p>at Seminary.</p>
        <p>By Chloe Breyer.</p>
        <p>Basic Books, $24.</p>
        <p>Chloe Breyer is someone you'd want as a friend -- earnest, analytical and endowed with a keen sense of social justice. And she's someone you'd just as soon avoid for the same reasons. In ''The Close: A Young Woman's First Year at Seminary,'' Breyer, newly married, the child of an American Jewish father (Justice Stephen G. Breyer of the Supreme Court) and an English Anglican mother, writes about finding her calling to become a priest. Or, at least, she believed she had, depending on the day. Organized around the church year (Advent to Pentecost), her book is an absorbing account of her (very much examined) life at the Episcopal Church's General Theological Seminary in Manhattan, often called the Close, after ''the precinct of any sacred place.'' Much of Breyer's charm lies in the fact that she is well aware of her weaknesses. In listing her thoughts on whether to join protests against the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, she notes that doing so would ''further solidify'' her ''reputation as knee-jerk, bleeding-heart liberal from Cambridge.'' (She did it anyway and was arrested.) Though determined to live a spiritual life, she finds ''plenty of opportunities for envy.'' And in her zeal she forgetfully gives communion to a Jewish man nearing coma. Her navete is tested during a pastoral stint at Bellevue when she realizes that ''the only places in the hospital where patients have time or inclination to discuss theological questions are the locked psychiatric wards and prison units.'' Most of all, she sees and comes to accept that the kingdom of the church is, like the secular world, imperfect, and that her task is to make a positive difference in whatever ways she can.</p>
