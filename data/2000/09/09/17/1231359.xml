        <p>American Express has discovered that giving away unlimited amounts of a service that costs money is not such a great strategy after all.</p>
        <p>For almost a year, the company's brokerage unit has offered commission-free online stock trades to anyone with at least $25,000 in an American Express brokerage account. Analysts questioned the wisdom of an offer that was likely to attract manic stock traders, hardly the long-term investors the company covets.</p>
        <p>Still, two companies followed its lead this year: Ameritrade Holdings' all-electronic unit, Freetrade.com, and a start-up, The Financial Cafe.com, each made free trading a core offering.</p>
        <p>Now, American Express is starting to distance itself from those decidedly downmarket operations. Next week, it will announce to customers a monthly limit on free trades: just three purchases a month for accounts of less than $100,000, and 10 free trades, either purchases or sales, for those of more than $100,000.</p>
        <p>People who trade more often -- about 1 customer in 10 -- cost the company too much, said David Kanihan, an American Express spokesman. ''What we want to do is either modify that behavior or have them trade elsewhere,'' he said.</p>
        <p>They are welcome at The Financial Cafe.com, said Andrew Koslow, its chief operating officer, explaining that his company's trade-processing setup allowed it to forgo commissions on some trades without losing money. The firm earns fees from companies like SmartLeaf and Ad viceAmerica.com that provide information and advice to investors on its site.</p>
        <p>''I've always wondered how American Express was going to do this,'' Mr. Koslow said.</p>
