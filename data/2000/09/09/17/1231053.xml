        <p>Q My credit history has prevented me from qualifying for a normal mortgage loan. Someone suggested that I obtain a subprime loan. How does this work? . . . Lloyd Pavlovi, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A Oded Ben-Ami, a senior loan officer with Sterling National Mortgage, a mortgage banker based in Great Neck, N.Y., said that while most subprime loans are used for refinances or second mortgages, such loans are available for purchasers who have less-than-perfect credit.</p>
        <p>''The application for a subprime loan is similar to the application for a conventional loan, but the approval process is often easier and faster,'' Mr. Ben-Ami said. ''That is because the subprime lender usually asks for less documentation and can usually issue an approval based only on a credit report and a phone conversation.''</p>
        <p>There is a price to be paid, however, for obtaining a loan from a subprime lender. ''A subprime loan is always more expensive than a conventional loan,'' Mr. Ben-Ami said, explaining that the additional expense is typically reflected in higher-than-normal interest rates and possibly in an increased number of points that must be paid up front to obtain the loan. (A point is one percent of the amount being borrowed.)</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, Mr. Ben-Ami said, the interest rate and points charged will depend on various criteria, including credit history, income, assets, type of property, loan amount, loan duration and the amount of the down payment.</p>
        <p>If the going rate, for example, for a conventional fixed-rate mortgage for a borrower with excellent credit, good income and a high down payment is 8 percent with no points, the subprime rate could be anywhere from 9 percent with no points to as much as 16 percent with eight points, depending on the purchaser's circumstances.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ben-Ami said that many banks and mortgage companies have subprime-loan departments. He added that lenders who specialize in such loans can also be found on the Internet and through advertisements in the real estate sections of many newspapers.</p>
        <p>He said that while subprime loans may be more expensive, they are sometimes the only way a purchaser can get the funds necessary to buy a house. ''And borrowers whose credit history restricts them to subprime loans can usually refinance to a better loan within 12 to 24 months if they have made all payments on time,'' Mr. Ben-Ami said. ''That means that a subprime loan can actually be regarded as a positive step toward credit repair and financial stability.''</p>
        <p>Late Fees In a Co-op</p>
        <p>Q Our co-op is 30 years old. Eighteen years ago, by resolution, the board put a late-fee policy into effect. Now the legality of that penalty is being challenged. Our proprietary lease does not contain any provision imposing interest or a penalty for late payment of maintenance. In order to have a legitimate late-payment fee, is it absolutely necessary to amend the lease? . . . Dorothy F. Hall, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A Marc J. Luxemburg, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that a late fee adopted by board resolution would probably be enforceable -- even without a provision in the proprietary lease authorizing the fee -- as long as the fee is not really a penalty in disguise.</p>
        <p>''Under most cooperative proprietary leases and bylaws, the board has inherent authority to adopt a wide range of policies,'' Mr. Luxemburg said. ''And I believe this would include a policy with respect to late fees.''</p>
        <p>He said that even if a proprietary lease does not specifically provide for late fees, the lease and bylaws generally authorize the board to adopt any rules necessary to operate and manage the co-op and to determine when and how maintenance should be paid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Luxemburg added that courts have generally enforced late fees as long as the fee is intended to compensate the co-op for the work involved in collecting the unpaid maintenance.</p>
        <p>''If the late fee is structured on a percentage-of-the-maintenance basis, or is substantial in relation to the amount of maintenance,'' he said, ''a court could characterize the fee as a disguised penalty and deem it unenforceable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Luxemburg said that most co-ops that impose late fees charge from $50 to $100.</p>
