      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In an attempt to steer tourists away from fake Aboriginal art -- much of it mass-produced in Asia -- a nonprofit group representing indigenous Australian artists has introduced a label to help visitors recognize the real thing. The National Indigenous Arts Advocacy Association's labels have begun appearing on individual souvenir items such as boomerangs and T-shirts with Aboriginal designs, and also on the windows of approved shops. The association hopes the program will also boost indigenous artists' shares of an industry that generates more than $120 million a year.</p>
        <p>To qualify for the label, artists must submit an application for approval by two Aboriginal leaders willing to vouch for the artists' identity and acceptance within their community. More than 300 artists have already registered for the label. The association expects the list to grow into the thousands as its workers reach more remote Aboriginal communities.</p>

More than 300 artists have already registered for the label. The association expects the list to grow into the thousands as its workers reach more remote Aboriginal communities.</p>
        <p>Because the program is still in its infancy -- the labels made their debut in June -- arts and crafts bearing Aboriginal designs but not the association's label aren't necessarily fakes. The association can be reached in Sydney at (61-2) 9241-3533.</p>
