        <p>In the world of politics, Missouri is a curious hybrid.</p>
        <p>It has two major cities: Kansas City with a Western flavor, St. Louis with an Eastern edge. It has large rural areas that resemble the Deep South. And it has fast-growing suburbs.</p>
        <p>Missouri, with a Democratic governor and two Republican senators, tends to seesaw in presidential contests. In all but one election since 1900, the state has voted for the winning presidential candidate. (The exception was 1956, when Missouri went for Adlai Stevenson over Dwight D. Eisenhower.)</p>
        <p>''I don't know whether to say we're a bipartisan state or simply ambivalent,'' said James W. Davis, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>But even by these standards, this contest for Missouri's 11 electoral votes is looking like a very close call, polls suggest.</p>
        <p>One poll, taken by Zogby International and published on Sept. 10 in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, showed Mr. Gore with a slight lead -- 45 percent to Mr. Bush's 40 percent. But with a margin of sampling error of 4 percentage points, that lead is decisively soft.</p>
        <p>''Bush, I think, isn't regarded worse than he was,'' Professor Davis said. ''He hasn't come down so much as Gore has come up.''</p>
        <p>In the poll, Mr. Gore's strongest support was in St. Louis. Outside the cities, he and Mr. Bush were statistically tied.</p>
        <p>The candidates or their running mates have been visiting Missouri almost once a week.</p>
        <p>The issues on the minds of Missourians are not too different from those preoccupying other voters. Education, health care and Social Security are most important, with farmers worried about agricultural policy.</p>
        <p>John Hancock, the executive director of the State Republican Party, said he was optimistic, partly because much of Missouri is still quite rural, and Democrats have trouble in rural states, he said.</p>
        <p>Roy Temple, executive director of the Missouri Democratic Party, said the suburbs were the real battleground. Mr. Gore is ''aggressively campaigning here and I think that's making a difference,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Politics is certainly on the brain in Missouri this year. There is a tight Senate race between the Republican incumbent, John Ashcroft, and Gov. Mel Carnahan. There are contests for governor, two Congressional seats and four other state offices.</p>
        <p>And with the presidential race, ''as neck and neck as it is,'' Mr. Davis said, ''everyone might think that their vote might make a difference.''</p>
