        <p>THINGS change, to quote the title of a David Mamet movie, and in the restaurant business change is virtually built in. That is why from time to time we like to look in at places that provided memorable dining experiences in the past. Following are observations from several of our most recent revisits.</p>
        <p>It was five years ago when tiny LA COLLINE VERTE in Fairfield lighted up the Connecticut dining scene with its witty decor and masterly cuisine. With memories of many exemplary meals enjoyed there, we recently returned to the charming, inn-like French restaurant.</p>
        <p>We are happy to report that very little has changed. Service is still polished (if a tad slow on a busy Saturday night), except for the annoying habit of clearing plates before everyone is finished.</p>
        <p>Ah, but the food was as ambrosial as we recalled. One appetizer, carpaccio de coquilles St.-Jacques (chopped sea-scallop carpaccio with artichokes, carrots julienne and droplets of balsamic and shallot vinaigrette), would be difficult to surpass. Warm duck pate with nuts in puff pastry, a velvety lobster bisque, and satin-smooth slab of foie gras, all reached heights of subtle perfection.</p>
        <p>Most entrees were presented in round stacked decks, but, unlike Pisa, these towers didn't lean. A mille-feuille de crevettes aux pommes et epinards piled shrimp, tart apples and spinach in a Napoleon with a soupcon of pickly warm brandy vinaigrette. Braised monkfish was layered with vegetables and spinach in a tangy red pesto dotted with bits of black (canned!) olives. Pistachio-crusted, crispy sweetbreads came with a smidgen of quince compote, sherry wine and black cherry jus. Our only non-towering entree was roasted and flambeed, succulent baby Cornish hen, accompanied by chopped cabbage and bacon sauce.</p>
        <p>Desserts were exquisite, served in refined portions. We reveled in an oven-hot, fluffy raspberry souffle garnished with raspberry coulis as well as a flourless chocolate cake, a true orgy of chocolate intensity. As lagniappes, there were flaky cheese straws to begin the meal, petits fours to end it. Happily, La Colline Verte still deserves an Excellent rating.</p>
        <p>La Colline Verte (1950 Bronson Road, Fairfield; 203-256-9242). Dinner entrees $18 to $28. All major credit cards accepted; reservations essential; jacket and tie suggested for men.</p>
        <p>SOLE RISTORANTE in New Canaan was notable in reviewing visits in 1998 for its food, its stylish decor -- and for the decibel level of a rock concert. Subsequent visits have convinced us that if your party wants to be able to converse normally, go early, before the crowds arrive, or late, when the place has cleared out.</p>
        <p>That done, we found the food still deserving of an Excellent rating, with many compelling choices. At lunch, carpaccio (a light meal in itself, with a generous supply of arugula, tomato, Parmigiana and balsamic vinegar along with the thinly sliced beef), calamari fritti and pizza Margherita were all appealing choices. Dinner brought us fettuccine pollo e pesto (grilled chicken, yellow and red tomatoes, summer squash and basil pesto), grilled yellowfin tuna (with Vidalia onion, potato puree, cucumber relish and grilled oyster mushrooms) and cotolette Milanese (thinly breaded veal escalope with a tomato-arugula salad), all were rewarding.</p>
        <p>Sole Ristorante (105 Elm Street, New Canaan; 203-972-8887). Dinner entrees $13 to $29. All major credit cards accepted; reservations accepted.</p>
        <p>When MORENO RISTORANTE opened in 1999, it had such assets as a bright decor in an attractive old stone house and scrumptious food. Pleasing touches included piping-hot garlic bread and oven-hot pizzas served gratis before the appetizers.</p>
        <p>But on a recent visit the service problems were so glaring that a birthday celebration was partially ruined by a waitstaff that was disinterested, sloppy and distracted.</p>
        <p>In a restaurant with upscale prices and setting, the glasses should sparkle, not be smeared with fingerprints and dishwasher-specked, as almost each one at our table was. A server should provide a wine list without having it requested twice, should know which diner gets which dish, should refill water and wine glasses and should crumb the table. We watched as another table was served complimentary pizzas, but we were not.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the goof-ups tended to outweigh the fact that many dishes were delicious. Capesante fra diavolo (nicely browned sea scallops in a spicy tomato sauce on soft polenta) and portobello (sauteed with garlic, basil, fresh herbs and virgin olive oil) made notable starters.</p>
        <p>Zitti al Gorgonzola, with al dente pasta and asparagus in a Parmesan-rich cream sauce, was luscious. Other praiseworthy entrees were agnello scottadito (pan-roasted lamb chops) and swordfish (moist and well-herbed). Desserts such as the chocolate mousse cake and Napoleon cake came in huge portions but had a commercial slickness.</p>
        <p>As tasty as some of our dishes were, they couldn't overcome our overall disastrous dining experience, one that currently rates a Good rating, rather than the Very Good of yore.</p>
        <p>Moreno Ristorante (554 Old Post Road No. 3, Greenwich; 203-661-3200). Dinner entrees $15 to $29. All major credit cards accepted; reservations accepted.</p>
