        <p>THE country begins to look delightful,'' a Princeton gardener wrote to a friend in May 1785. ''Our shrubbery is all putting out, the hyacinths, narcissus, jonquils and Daffy, in fully bloom with the verdure of the grass in contrast make a most delightful scene.''</p>
        <p>Next Saturday , the latest incarnation of that garden officially opens to the public, completing the first part of a three-phase, multimillion-dollar renovation of the Colonial estate Morven and its grounds.</p>
        <p>The facade of the main house has been restored to its 1850's appearance, as have the extensive front grounds leading to Stockton Street. At the rear of the house, an attached kitchen was removed and replaced by a porch. A separate, two-story building that was the wash house, servants' quarters and icehouse is now the Visitors' Center.</p>
        <p>Also in the rear is the descendant of the garden that so delighted its 1785 creator, Annis Boudinot Stockton, whose husband, Richard, built Morven in the 1750's. The current garden, however, does not reflect an effort to recreate Mrs. Stockton's handiwork. Instead, it is a meticulous restoration of the garden of another Morven resident, Helen Hamilton Shields Stockton, who in the 1890's designed a garden in the tradition of her predecessor.</p>
        <p>It is this blending of eras, Morven's restoration team says, that will distinguish this Princeton landmark from other historical restorations. Unlike the properties at Colonial Williamsburg, for example, the new Morven was designed to be a place with ''multiple layers of history,'' said Annabelle Radcliffe-Trenner, one of the architects.</p>
        <p>''It was just not feasible to take the house back to the 1750's,'' said Emily Croll, the executive director of Historic Morven, the nonprofit group that oversees Morven. (The property is owned by the state.)</p>
        <p>The gardens and grounds represent three periods. A double row of horse chestnuts has been planted to recreate the mid-19th-century ''walk'' leading to downtown Princeton, and a slight mound rises again in front of the portico. Research documented the early placement of the mound, Ms. Croll said, but its rationale remains a mystery.</p>
        <p>In the rear, across a red brick wall from the recreated 1890's garden with its borders of boxwoods, is a ''working garden.'' Here an array of colorful flowers spans the history of Morven, with two rows of 18th-century plants, two of 19th-century plants and one of 20th-century plants. Unlike its formalized neighbor across the wall, this garden is to be a changing exhibition, with the plants also for sale. The current theme is ''Plants of Pleasure.''</p>
        <p>The layers of history are evident in the house as well. More than 20 coats of yellow paint have been scraped away from the exterior and replaced by a white limewash. Not only is the new color accurate for the 1850's -- the yellow was first used in the 1890's -- but the limewash also allows visitors to trace Morven's architectural evolution. Lines in the brickwork clearly show where wings were added, where windows once were and where the original roof began.</p>
        <p>Similarly, two walls in the west wing remain exposed to reveal the three fireplaces that were installed over the years. Sharp-eyed visitors may also be able to see the horsehairs in the stucco.</p>
        <p>For now, the interior of the house has little to interest visitors beside portraits (including two Sullys) of various owners of Morven. The bare rooms remain largely as they were when Morven was the home of New Jersey's governors from 1954 to 1981. Renovation work is to begin next spring, after which the rooms will house permanent and revolving exhibits on design, architecture, crafts and New Jersey history.</p>
        <p>Morven will be open to the public from 11 am. to 2 p.m. on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from Sept. 27 through Nov. 30; a $2 donation is suggested. Tours, on the hour, will include an exhibit on the history of the site from the first Stockton family through the last governor; the grounds, with emphasis on the gardens; and the house.</p>
        <p>Visitors are encouraged to linger as long as they wish. Nine information panels have been installed along the paths.</p>
        <p>FAMILY DAY AT MORVEN  55 Stockton Street, Princeton.  Next Saturday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.  Demonstrations of making quilts and corn-husk dolls, Colonial games and gardening techniques. A house tour at noon; garden tours on the half-hour.  (609) 683-4495.</p>
