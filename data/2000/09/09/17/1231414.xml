        <p>Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have made clear the differences in how they would use the federal budget surplus, the much-anticipated but as yet unrealized bounty of prosperity.</p>
        <p>But both candidates face the same question: Can the government really afford what they are proposing?</p>
        <p>The answer, at best, is maybe.</p>
        <p>A close reading of the proposals put forward by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore, and interviews with economists and analysts inside and outside the campaigns, suggest the budget plans are more substantive than those developed by the two parties in previous elections, but that each hinges on optimistic assumptions.</p>
        <p>If the surplus materializes as projected, if the candidates have not underestimated the cost of their proposals, if Congress does not pass any expensive initiatives of its own, if nothing unexpected happens in the next decade to put new demands on the nation's finances, then their numbers, at least as they present them, would basically add up.</p>
        <p>The odds of everything falling into place as anticipated for the next decade, the period covered by their proposals, are slim. Among budget analysts, the entire notion of putting specific dollar figures on plans extending 10 years into the unknown is considered absurd.</p>
        <p>Still, the candidates' plans provide a look at priorities and a test of their ability to meet what has emerged as a threshold standard for good governance: fiscal responsibility.</p>
        <p>If his accounting is taken at face value, Mr. Gore has an advantage in that he has built more of a buffer into his budget. Mr. Bush, even by his own reckoning, has less wiggle room should the surplus fall short of expectations or the need for new spending be greater than he assumes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has made a tax cut the centerpiece of his budget. Mr. Gore stresses new spending and reducing the national debt. Each campaign seeks every day to punch holes in the other's budget arithmetic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's campaign contends that Mr. Gore has understated, by hundreds of billions of dollars, the cost of his plan to promote retirement savings. The Gore camp points out that Mr. Bush has not included in his budget any money to deploy a national missile defense, a cornerstone of Mr. Bush's military policy.</p>
        <p>The issue, though, is not just how the candidates would apportion the surplus. The starting point has to be, how much is there to apportion?</p>
        <p>The experience of the last few years suggests that the surplus projections could grow even larger if the economy continues to expand at anything close to its recent pace.</p>
        <p>Yet some economists say that the projections, even if they prove correct, overstate how much money will be available for tax and spending initiatives.</p>
        <p>They say that beyond the proposals made by the presidential candidates is an array of other initiatives, with powerful political momentum behind them, that will almost certainly eat up a substantial portion of the surplus over the next decade.</p>
        <p>Still other economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, question whether the surplus, however big it proves to be, should go to any combination of tax cuts or spending increases before the $3.5 trillion national debt is paid off and the long-term solvency of the Social Security and Medicare systems is assured.</p>
        <p>The Congressional Budget Office projects that the total federal budget surplus from 2001 through 2010 will be $4.56 trillion.</p>
        <p>Of that, $2.39 trillion would come from excess payroll tax revenue earmarked for Social Security. The two parties have agreed not to use the Social Security surplus for tax cuts or spending programs. Mr. Gore would use it to pay down the national debt, except for $97 billion he would use to increase benefits for elderly women. Mr. Bush would split it between debt reduction and helping to pay for his proposal to create private investment accounts within Social Security.</p>
        <p>That leaves $2.17 trillion in projected non-Social Security surpluses available over the next decade for tax cuts and new spending.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's plan starts with a tax cut of just over $1.3 trillion. He values his spending initiatives at $475 billion, including $158 billion for the addition of prescription drug coverage to Medicare, $132 billion to make health insurance more affordable and $45 billion in additional money for the military.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's tax and spending package comes to $1.79 trillion. After adding the interest costs that stem from using the surplus for any purpose other than debt reduction -- $312 billion in this case -- the total Bush budget comes to about $2.1 trillion, or just $70 billion less than the anticipated surplus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush seeks to give himself a little more breathing room by pledging to produce savings of a little less than $200 billion over 10 years from what he terms government reform. He can therefore claim that he still has $265 billion in reserve.</p>
        <p>''The combination of Social Security reform, tax rate reductions and debt reduction that are in George W. Bush's plan is a responsible framework for helping us prepare for the future,'' said John F. Cogan, an economist who advises the Bush campaign on fiscal policy. ''The $260 billion to $300 billion cushion should suffice to meet contingencies that might arise.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore starts by asserting that the $2.17 trillion surplus is actually a $1.81 trillion surplus.</p>
        <p>Just as the two parties have agreed to wall off the portion of the surplus generated by Social Security, Mr. Gore says they should also agree to neither spend nor use for tax cuts the portion of the surplus from excess Medicare payroll tax revenues -- $360 billion over the next decade. He says he would use that money only to reduce the national debt.</p>
        <p>His proposal has considerable bipartisan support. When a similar measure came to a vote in the House in June, it passed by 420 to 2, with not a single Republican voting against it.</p>
        <p>Of the remaining $1.81 trillion surplus, Mr. Gore would use $1.51 trillion, according to his campaign's estimates, for his tax and spending initiatives and their interest costs.</p>
        <p>He would provide tax cuts of $480 billion. He would allocate $340 billion to Medicare, including the addition of prescription drug coverage and money to keep the insurance program solvent. He would increase spending on national security, including the military, by $100 billion, and would provide an additional $120 billion each to health care and the environment. The interest costs for his plans would be $253 billion. Mr. Gore would then set aside the remaining $300 billion as a reserve fund.</p>
        <p>To help his numbers add up, Mr. Gore assumes that his tax cut can be partly paid for with $96 billion he says could be raised by closing tax loopholes. He assumes that he can eliminate $30 billion in wasteful spending from the Pentagon and other agencies. And he proposes to raise $66 billion by raising taxes on cigarettes.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore has put forward a strong, pro-growth framework which includes bold steps for education, research and savings and working-family tax cuts,'' said Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy director, who is advising the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's approach ''not only continues the path toward making America debt-free, but even includes a $300 billion surplus reserve to ensure we get there even if unexpected emergencies or contingencies occur,'' Mr. Sperling said.</p>
        <p>Both plans have vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's budget would overrun the projected surplus if Congress were to bar the use of the Medicare surplus for tax cuts or spending, as Mr. Gore has proposed.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush cannot find the promised $200 billion in savings from what he calls government reform, he would have trouble paying for potentially expensive initiatives like deploying a national missile defense. And his budget makes no provision for the possibility that his plan to create investment accounts within Social Security might require money from general tax revenues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore could have trouble if his initiatives prove to be more expensive than he has estimated. Republican budget analysts in Congress say Mr. Gore has badly understated the costs not only of his retirement savings plan but also of other proposals, like his call for universal preschool education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore could also have trouble raising some of the nonsurplus money he is counting on. The Clinton administration's efforts to increase taxes on cigarettes have gone nowhere, and its efforts to crack down on tax loopholes have found little support in Congress.</p>
        <p>But because Mr. Gore has not committed as much to tax and spending initiatives as Mr. Bush, he possibly  has more flexibility should his budget plans go awry. At least by his own accounting, he can claim to have a buffer of at least $660 billion: the $360 billion Medicare surplus, which Mr. Gore would put to reducing the national debt, plus his $300 billion reserve fund.</p>
        <p>That is nearly $400 billion more than Mr. Bush's $265 billion buffer.</p>
        <p>Even as the two candidates accuse each other of busting the budget, economists are debating how big the surplus will prove to be.</p>
        <p>The Congressional Budget Office's projections are built around a series of assumptions: that government spending will rise by the rate of inflation over the next 10 years, that economic growth will average about 2.7 percent a year and that no other policies will be enacted or changed.</p>
        <p>Changing any of those assumptions leads to substantial changes in the surplus numbers.</p>
        <p>An analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, concluded that only about $700 billion of the surplus would be left for initiatives.</p>
        <p>The center said there was strong bipartisan support for walling off the $360 billion Medicare surplus. Extending a series of politically popular tax breaks, as Congress has done regularly in the past, and limiting the expansion of the alternative minimum tax, as both parties have said they want to do, would eat up another $230 billion.</p>
        <p>If spending were to rise not at the rate of inflation, but at a pace that history suggests is more realistic -- allowing spending to remain level in per-person terms after adjusting for inflation -- another $400 billion of the surplus would disappear, the center said.</p>
        <p>Put aside another $500 billion to deal with the long-term financial problems of Social Security and Medicare, the report said, and the available surplus comes to about a third of its original $2.17 trillion.</p>
        <p>It is also possible that the surplus estimate is too low, given the strong economy. The budget office and the White House have regularly had to revise their surplus figures upward for the last several years.</p>
        <p>Economists at Lehman Brothers, the investment firm, have projected that if real economic growth is around 4 percent a year rather than the 2.7 percent assumed by the budget office, the non-Social Security surplus will be $348 billion higher over 10 years than the budget office's figure. Most economists think the economy is capable of growing about 4 percent a year in the long run.</p>
