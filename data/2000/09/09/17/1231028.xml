        <p>Is there a grown-up alive who has not scraped off a redolent shoe and cursed the darkness -- the light, too -- after walking blindly where dogs have walked before? Well, it's your own fault, and you should be ashamed of yourself. It seems that since time began, small furry creatures called Gigglers have been keeping their baby-sized eyes on children, following them everywhere to make sure that adults treat them fairly. And if the big people don't, they get the Treatment, courtesy of the Gigglers.</p>
        <p>Here is what you should know about THE GIGGLER TREATMENT (Arthur A. Levine/Scholastic, $14.95; all ages): It is the story of a man, Mister Mack, who gets slated for the Treatment, and then of the mad-dash efforts of his family, a neighboring dog and a very, very small Giggler to prevent its unjust (as it turns out) execution. It is written by Roddy Doyle, heretofore saluted (with the Booker Prize, among other rewards) as the Irish author of grimy adult fiction and henceforth to be beloved by anyone who enjoys reading (or listening) and cracking up at the same time. It is illustrated by Brian Ajhar, a Pennsylvanian whose black-and-white vision is askew enough to more than do the words justice.</p>

        <p>Here is what you should know about THE GIGGLER TREATMENT (Arthur A.

        <p>The book has as many surprises as an encyclopedia, including chapter headings that alone are worth the price of admission, but with none of the sobriety. To its credit, the plot is as contrived as possible and proves that, in the right hands, digression is an art form. To be more specific would be to spoil a whole lot of fun.</p>
        <p>The story is, just by its premise, slightly naughty, but nicely so, never offensively. Has a child ever not tittered about body functions, be they of man or beast? (Second graders, it seems to me, should be ready to handle the book themselves; after that, anybody who can still see the pages. And it was made for read-aloud family fun, no matter how young the audience.)</p>
        <p>It's in sum, and not to damn the book with the cliched praise of reviews, a delight. It really is clever, insightful, sensical, nonsensical, knowing, amusing, witty, wacky. It makes you laugh out loud; it makes you laugh to yourself. It gives you a contagious case of the you-know-whats.</p>
        <p>Now, for his second children's adventure, if Doyle will only explain the chewing gum I step on</p>
