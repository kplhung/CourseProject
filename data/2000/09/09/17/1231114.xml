        <p>CILE DOWNS, an artist from the hamlet of Springs, set aside her brushes recently and took up a pen to enlist her neighbors in a drive to preserve 4,500 acres of watershed land in the South Fork towns of East Hampton and Southampton.</p>
        <p>The wooded rolling land, on the border of the towns' northern tier, are crucial to assuring future drinking water supplies, Ms. Downs and other members of the Save South Fork Water Now Coalition say, but will soon be rolled under by surging development unless something is done.</p>
        <p>The coalition wants to put the preservation question to town voters on Nov. 7, but the towns are resisting. Both sides agreed last week that the matter was likely to end up in court.</p>
        <p>The elected officials of the two towns insist current two- , three-  and five-acre zoning already adequately protects the land,  deep recharge areas for the South Fork's generally shallow supply of underground drinking water, the sole supply for the area.</p>
        <p>Ms. Downs and others distressed by the pace of development differ. ''I see the future looking very dismal if we don't protect the groundwater,'' Ms. Downs said. ''The development is causing a crisis, it's going so fast.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Downs, a Springs resident since 1954, spent considerable time this summer petitioning at local post offices and buttonholing friends at gatherings. Her objective, she said, was to collect as many signatures as possible on a petition to put a referendum on the East Hampton town ballot in November to protect the 4,500 acres.</p>
        <p>Studies dating back more than 30 years identified the wooded expanses and their highly permeable sandy soils as vital rechargers of rainwater into underground aquifers, creeks and the Peconic Bays.</p>
        <p>Once overtaken by houses, roads, septic systems and fertilizer-laden lawns, supporters of protection said, the land would contribute to water degradation rather than protect water quality.</p>
        <p>The referendum, and an identical referendum in Southampton, would ask voters in the two towns whether they wanted to enact what would be called the South Fork Drinking Water Protection Act of 2000. The act would mandate that the towns restrain development on the 4,500 privately owned acres while they prepared a management plan for acquisition and other far-reaching measures to keep the land clear of housing.</p>
        <p>Money for the preservation purchases, supporters of the referendums said, would come in part from a 2 percent real estate transfer tax approved by voters in both towns two years ago. The tax revenues are set aside for acquisitions of watersheds and open space. Suffolk County and the state would also contribute an unspecified amount of money, they said.</p>
        <p>A leader of the preservation effort, State Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele Jr., a Republican whose district includes the South Fork, said the acquisitions could be carried out without raising property taxes.</p>
        <p>''The area in need of protection is so small that it seems inconceivable that we would be unable to preserve it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Signatures of registered voters collected by Ms. Downs and dozens of other volunteers and civic activists aligned with the East End's influential environmental groups far exceed the numbers needed to place the referendums on the town ballots.  But it appeared far from certain that the referendums would make it to the ballot.</p>
        <p>Officials in the Town of East Hampton said that the referendum was defective and that it asked the town to do more than the law allowed. ''It would be illegal for the town to put this on the ballot,'' said Jay Schneiderman, the East Hampton supervisor, who also said that the referendum ''would actually undermine the town board's authority and challenge the basic precepts of representative democracy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schneiderman said that the town was ''doing its job to protect groundwater and has in fact gone beyond the call of duty.''</p>
        <p>''The notion that East Hampton has to be forced to protect its groundwater is ridiculous,'' he said. He released figures showing that 416.5 acres in various parts of the town had been bought this year with $10.8 million of financing from the town, Suffolk County, New York State and private individuals and groups. The figures showed contracts or pending contracts for an additional 398 acres at a cost that would exceed $32 million. Of the total of more than 800 acres, 522 acres would be protected in the interest of groundwater, according to the figures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schneiderman said the town's share was $19 million. He estimated that the cost of acquiring the 1,500 acres of the proposed 4,500-acre preserve area that were in East Hampton would exceed $50 million.</p>
        <p>SOUTHAMPTON'S supervisor, Vincent J. Cannuscio, described the referendum as a publicity stunt by environmental groups seeking issues to build membership.</p>
        <p>''The fact is that perhaps more than any other town Southampton has enacted zoning and other protective measures that secure our ground and surface water,'' he said. He added that less than 3 percent of the approximately 3,000-acre part of the proposed protected area in Southampton was zoned for less than five, three or two acres.</p>
        <p>But the coalition members said the picture presented by the supervisors was misleading. In Southampton in particular, they said, the town supervisor and town board majority dragged their feet in advancing preservation programs approved by voters.</p>
        <p>Kevin McDonald, the vice president of the group for the South Fork in Bridgehampton, a private land planning and conservation group, said that with tens of millions in local, county and state funds to draw on, the town had moved at a snail's pace as development overtook more and more remaining watersheds and open lands</p>
        <p>''Never before has a town with so much done so little,'' Mr. McDonald said. He said that under current zoning, the 4,500 acres were not adequately protected. He said if the town took no action to further protect its watershed areas, the amounts of contaminants reaching groundwater and the Peconic Bays would double.</p>
        <p>Mr. McDonald said local officials were catering to the desires of development interests. ''The purpose of the referendum vote is to make the towns do a plan and identify their priority acquisitions and do an analysis of the revenues available,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schneiderman and Mr. Cannuscio said they were in the midst of creating a common plan. They said officials of the two towns would meet this week to discuss it.</p>
        <p>''We are already well on our way to having a common plan,'' Mr. Schneiderman said. ''We recognize that we share a common aquifer.'' But Mr. Thiele said he was worried that the meeting would be a public relations effort. ''My fear is that this will be just an attempt to distract attention away from what we are trying to do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thiele and members of the coalition have criticized the two towns for recently rejecting -- after first appearing to favor -- an expansion of the Long Island Pine Barons Preserve to protect the same areas addressed in the proposed referendums. The 100,000-acre state preserve, which encompasses areas of western Southampton, includes a core area of more than 50,000 acres were development is barred. Owners of the core land may sell their development rights to a Pine Barons commission or to private developers for use elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Richard L. Amper Jr., the executive director of the Long Island Pine Barons Society, said boundaries of the 4,500 acres named in the referendums were ''almost coterminus with maps generated by the town planning departments themselves'' during discussion of the Pine Barons extension. ''There is no dispute between the environmentalists and the planners about what needs to be protected,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Amper estimated that as much as $400 million in town, county and state financing was available for watershed protection programs. He said some of the town financing could come from the 2 percent transfer tax, which generates about $15 million annually in Southampton and somewhat less in East Hampton.</p>
        <p>The coalition members said that they would consider legal action to overturn town actions to block the referendums. They released a poll showing that voters overwhelmingly wanted the towns to allow the referendums, and also overwhelmingly believed officials were not doing enough to protect drinking and surface water.</p>
        <p>Robert A. Wieboldt, the executive vice president of the Long Island Builders Institute in Islandia, said the referendums would attempt to force the towns to acquire land whose acquisition was not needed to protect water. ''To say that buying the land is the only way to protect it is just absolute nonsense,'' Mr. Wieboldt said. He said that requirements that large parts of developed lots be left in their natural state or that homes be clustered near roads could further lessen development impacts that, he added, current zoning already severely limited.</p>
        <p>Mr. McDonald said the coalition was reacting to a looming crisis. ''We are not making this stuff up,'' he said.</p>
