        <p>Less than a week after winning the United States Open, Venus Williams was not only on top of the world, but also on the other side of the world. Williams and her teammates on the United States Olympic tennis squad arrived here Friday, just in time to drop off their luggage and march in the opening ceremony at Olympic Stadium.</p>
        <p>''I'd say that's pretty good for one day,'' said Lindsay Davenport, who lost to Williams in the Open final on Sept. 9, but who joins forces with her now on what is most likely the strongest women's team in the tournament.</p>
        <p>Venus Williams, Davenport and Monica Seles will play singles for the United States when competition starts on Tuesday, and Venus Williams will team with her sister, Serena, in the doubles. The United States captain, Billie Jean King, was candid about her expectations for her players.</p>
        <p>''There's no reason in the world we shouldn't sweep all the medals,'' King said. ''If we get the job done, that's a possibility. Now whether we do that or not, who knows? There's great competition out there. But this is totally the dream team, and I know that playing here means a lot to them. This is definitely as good as it gets.''</p>
        <p>Davenport, Seles and the Williams sisters are tennis adversaries who now must join forces as a team, but only to a point. Each would have to beat one or more of the others to win gold. ''We're all professionals, and we understand the professional relationship,'' Venus Williams said. ''We're going against each other and we all want to win, because, what's wrong with trying to win?''</p>
        <p>Asked whether she felt unbeatable, she said: ''At this point, I haven't lost in a little while, so I don't know what it's like to lose  for a few months. It's a great feeling.''</p>
