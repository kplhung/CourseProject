        <p>An aquarium seems almost de rigueur in Berlin bars these days, an indication perhaps that the high-energy, low-sophistication scene of the 1990's is giving way to the quieter comforts of a leather chair, a fine martini and a touch of fish gazing. Not that the adrenaline is gone from Berlin; it is merely being channeled in more refined directions. The all-night techno parties still burn, but an after-work scene of neophyte government and e-business types has also come to life in the new capital.</p>
        <p>Take Reingold, an elegant watering hole that hides its charms behind a very discreet entrance in the midst of Mitte, the buzzing central area that once abutted the eastern side of the Berlin Wall. The bar stretches almost the entire length of a narrow room whose far wall is adorned with an androgynous mural. The place is chic but understated: no gleaming mirror reflects the bottles behind the bar and the overall effect may be described as Manet meeting Hopper. Even the fish tank is discreet.</p>

        <p>An aquarium seems almost de rigueur in Berlin bars these days, an indication perhaps that the high-energy, low-sophistication scene of the 1990's is giving way to the quieter comforts of a leather chair, a fine martini and a touch of fish gazing. Not that the adrenaline is gone from Berlin; it is merely being channeled in more refined directions. The all-night techno parties still burn, but an after-work scene of neophyte government and e-business types has also come to life in the new capital.</p>
        <p>Take Reingold, an elegant watering hole that hides its charms behind a very discreet entrance in the midst of Mitte, the buzzing central area that once abutted the eastern side of the Berlin Wall. The bar stretches almost the entire length of a narrow room whose far wall is adorned with an androgynous mural. The place is chic but understated: no gleaming mirror reflects the bottles behind the bar and the overall effect may be described as Manet meeting Hopper. Even the fish tank is discreet.</p>
        <p>The cocktails are mediocre, but Berlin's beautiful people are here in abundance after midnight. And in Berlin, sensuality often has a brash and electric tinge, the charge of a city whose very essence is flux.</p>
        <p>For movement, it is hard to beat WMF, a club that has already shifted premises several times since it began life soon after the fall of the Berlin Wall in what had been the WMF kitchenware factory. In vast new premises since June, its entrance now commands a magnificent view of the illuminated dome of the restored Oranienburgerstrasse synagogue. The exhilarating open-endedness and strangeness of Berlin is evident as you edge down a dimly lighted street, along a crumbling graffiti-smattered wall, to emerge into WMF, a converted warehouse where large crowds dressed mainly in gray and black dance on concrete floors to sounds dominated by house and techno music. This club is spare, intense, raw, a great place to let loose.</p>
        <p>For a cooler, and very flirtatious, note, try the Greenwich on Gipsstrasse, a new joint that has taken the aquarium craze to impressive lengths (the length of the bar, to be precise). Cowhide adorns the padded walls and a certain animal intensity is definitely in the air as couples, heterosexual and homosexual, admire each other over some of the best martinis and whiskey sours in the city. This establishment, full of Asian-Germans and African-Germans, gives a real sense of the new Berlin, a city whose population is an exotic mix. Closing time is 6 a.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m. weekends, so there is little problem squeezing in that last drink.</p>
        <p>As you roll home, you may wish to look in on Newton's, a swinging bar on the handsome Gendarmenmarkt decorated with Helmut Newton's photographs, and on 90 Grad, an upmarket disco that is as louche as the city it serves.</p>
        <p>Greenwich Bar, 5 Gipsstrasse; (49-177) 280-8806. Free admission.</p>
        <p>90 Grad, 37 Dennewitzstrasse; (49-30) 2300-5954. Open Tuesday, Friday and Saturday. Admission, $6.80 to $9, at 2.2 marks to the dollar.</p>
        <p>WMF, 23 Ziegelstrasse; (49-30) 2838-8850. Closed Wednesday and Sunday. Admission, $6.80 to $9.</p>
        <p>Reingold, 11 Novalisstrasse; (49-30) 2838 7676. Free admission.</p>
        <p>Newton, 57 Charlottenstrasse; (49-30) 2029 5421. Free admission.</p>
