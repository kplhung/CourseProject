        <p>The Greyhound seems to carry more people away from here than it ever brings back. Cindy Lamb works the cash register at the bus stop, and, one ticket stub at a time, she sells young people a way out of Dixie County.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing for them here but the logging in the woods, or at a sawmill,'' she said, making change at the Chevron station that also serves as the bus depot. Her own son left to find work in the Georgia carpet mills.</p>
        <p>Outside, people buy gas $5, $10 at a time. Gas just went up 2 cents a gallon here, which is a lot, Ms. Lamb said, to a man who watches his paycheck trickle much too fast into the tank of his pickup.</p>
        <p>People complain to her about hard times, low-paying jobs and high gas prices because her counter is a way station in this town of just over 2,000 people in northwest Florida. They blame the federal government in a vague, distrusting way, but even in an election year, a year when the nation will choose a new president, there is little talk of voting for change, or of voting at all.</p>
        <p>People here look at Al Gore and George W. Bush and see two men born to the country club, men whose family histories jingle with silver spoons. They appear, to people here, just the same.</p>
        <p>''I don't think they think about people like us, and if they do care,  they're not going to do anything for us,'' said Ms. Lamb, 41, who has lived in Cross City since 1969. ''Maybe, if they had ever lived in a two-bedroom trailer, it would be different.''</p>
        <p>''I don't think either one of those men running for president has ever had to worry about where their next paychecks are coming from,'' said Ms. Lamb, who said she was registered to vote but cannot remember the last time that she did. ''I don't think they ever had to throw watermelons around in a field.''</p>
        <p>It is not just apathy, say Ms. Lamb and others here, that will keep people away from the polls on Election Day in Dixie County, a county with a  tradition of low voter turnout, the lowest in Florida in 1998 and 1996.</p>
        <p>It is anger, over being ignored and, in some ways, left behind.</p>
        <p>Poorer people here never felt any connection with Republicans. But, as  Mr. Gore has moved to the nation's political center, people like Aundray Dogain who work in low-paying jobs  know that means they are being left behind. The disillusionment here with the national candidates runs so deep that though the roads are lined with political signs for local politicians, there is no sign of Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore in Dixie County.</p>
        <p>''They look the same to me,'' said Ms. Dogain, 31, who manages a shift at the McDonald's in Cross City. She says she believes her life will remain the same, no matter which political party wins.</p>
        <p>It always has.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Gore, people here point out, who pushed so hard for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which, they say, has led to the closing of manufacturing plants around the country and sent jobs to Mexico.</p>
        <p>''Why vote? I don't want to waste my time,'' said Ms. Dogain, a single mother who must feed, clothe and care for three children on a paycheck that brings in little more than the minimum wage, which is $5.15 an hour. ''I don't even pay attention to those two, and all my friends say the same thing. My life won't change.''</p>
        <p>She does not want charity, she said, just a candidate who seems to be sincere when he talks about poor people.</p>
        <p>Bill Clinton promised poor people health insurance, people here in Dixie County point out, and a Republican-controlled Congress shot his plan down. It was the last time people here remember a candidate who at least tried to do anything that would help their lives.</p>
        <p>''I dream of having a bigger house, a better car, a piece of land, but I don't think politicians are going to help me get that,'' said Ms. Dogain, who owns her three-bedroom mobile home and drives a 1987 Dodge Caravan.</p>
        <p>She hears Al Gore talk about continuing the nation's prosperity and she cringes.</p>
        <p>She hears George W. Bush talk about how things could be done so much better, and she cringes again. She knows what the Republicans mean when they talk about good times, and she believes that it seldom includes a 31-year-old black woman who works in the heat and grease of a fast-food restaurant.</p>
        <p>''They use people like us to get votes, and they don't end up doing anything good for us,'' said Ms. Dogain, who said she had not voted in the past decade and would not vote on Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>It is not just this election that has people uninspired, if not angry. It is a series of elections.</p>
        <p>In 1998, when Mr. Bush's brother, Jeb, won the race for governor of Florida, only 31.9 percent of Dixie County's 9,898 registered voters went to the polls, compared with the state average of 49.5 percent.</p>
        <p>In 1996, when President Clinton won his second term, a surprising 48 percent of Dixie County voters turned out, but the county still had the lowest average turnout in a state in which 67.4 percent of voters turned out.</p>
        <p>''My vote won't help me, it won't help my family,'' said Tracy Hunt, 25, a manager at the Hardee's restaurant in Cross City. ''It doesn't matter. That's the harsh reality.''</p>
        <p>''They say they care,'' Mr. Hunt said. ''This is just to get in. This time next year, it'll be a different ballgame.''</p>
        <p>To Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore, he said, Dixie County is a ''faraway land,'' of people who do not matter, and ''too small of a town'' to even worry about.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hunt's father is a foreman in a lumberyard and his mother owns a small crafts business. He is divorced, and had to move back in with his parents.</p>
        <p>He is training for a new job in computers. Almost everyone in Cross City talks about computers as if they are an employment promised land.</p>
        <p>The most angry -- and dejected -- people in Cross City are not people sitting around waiting for welfare. That is not the help they want.</p>
        <p>They want jobs. They want new plants. They say they want an old-fashioned politician who does not speak of the global economy as an excuse for the lack of jobs.</p>
        <p>Instead, they say they get politicians who lobby Congress for legislation to send jobs away.</p>
        <p>They are no longer even sure what they want from a political champion.</p>
        <p>They just know that they do not have one, and say they have given up on ever having one.</p>
        <p>''People here work hard,'' Ms. Lamb said. And while they survive, they seldom prosper. She and her husband, a construction worker, rent a house. They asked the landlord if they could rent to buy, and he said he would think about it.</p>
        <p>''It's old, but it's a good little house,'' she said. ''I sure would like to have it.''</p>
        <p>It is the real world that they live in, she says, a world that the presidential candidates have no connection with.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people don't care any more,'' Ms. Lamb said. ''Life doesn't get any better. The politicians don't bring any industry. If you don't have the silver spoon in your mouth, you join the Army or you leave.''</p>
        <p>''Yesterday, gas went up to $1.61 from 1.59. Those guys,'' she said of the candidates, ''don't worry about things like that. But it's a lot.''</p>
        <p>It is an ugly thought, she said, but it crosses her mind now and then. She thinks the candidates would be happier if people like her did not exist at all.</p>
        <p>''Then,'' she said, ''they don't have us complaining.''</p>
