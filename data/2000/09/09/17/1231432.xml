        <p>After three days of negotiations, officials from the Gore and Bush campaigns agreed today on the formats and structure of three presidential debates in October and selected Jim Lehrer, the anchorman of PBS's ''News Hour,'' as the moderator for all three.</p>
        <p>The campaigns also agreed that one presidential debate and the single vice-presidential debate would be conducted with the candidates seated at a table, the first time in the 40-year history of presidential debates for such a seating arrangement.</p>
        <p>Also new is a timing system that will be less rigid than in previous debates. In the first debate, after a two-minute response from one candidate and a one-minute rebuttal from the other, the moderator will be allowed to use his discretion in giving the candidates up to three and a half minutes to address each other. In the next two debates, the time for the candidates to mix it up with each other after each question will be unlimited.</p>
        <p>The details took eight hours today for the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Elections to hammer out with representatives of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>Each campaign said it came away with something -- the Gore campaign fought for three debates, which it won, and the Bush campaign fought for the less rigid format, which it won. Donald L. Evans, Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, emerged from the negotiations here tonight praising the free-flowing debates. William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, lauded the agreement for allowing ''the widest possible audience.''</p>
        <p>Campaign officials said the three debates would be the only presidential match-ups, with no other debates on other networks. With five networks agreeing to broadcast the events live, the debates are guaranteed a wider audience than they would have received with only one network showing them.</p>
        <p>The first debate, Oct. 3 in Boston at the University of Massachusetts, will be held with Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush standing at lecterns. The second, set for Oct. 11 at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., is to be conducted at a table. The third, on Oct. 17 at Washington University in St. Louis, will be a town-hall format.</p>
        <p>Each debate will last 90 minutes and begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time. One 90-minute debate for the vice-presidential nominees, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democrat, and Dick Cheney, the Republican, is scheduled for Oct. 5 at Centre College in Danville, Ky.</p>
        <p>The moderator for the vice presidential debate is to be announced next week.</p>
