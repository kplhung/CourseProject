        <p>''You have to go to Queen,'' my friend said. ''It's the baddest club in Paris.''</p>
        <p>There is a surprising diversity to the after-dark diversions of Paris, enough to please anyone from the bused-in Dutch tourists lined up for topless shows in Pigalle to the blue bloods of the 16th Arrondissement checking each other out at BCBG (bon chic, bon genre) bars.</p>
        <p>But ''bad'' is not the first thing that comes to mind. Parisians, in public at least, are generally fairly well behaved. So, for something different, we decided to make Queen the goal of a night on the town.</p>
        <p>Not without a few preliminaries, of course. Though Paris may lack the after-hours exuberance of, say, Madrid, things don't really get started at Queen and other clubs until at least 1 a.m. or so, which left us about three hours to kill.</p>
        <p>Our first stop was Le Fumoir, a clubby place across the street from the Louvre. Its cigar bar ambience, bare wood floor and Art Deco fittings draw a self-consciously stylish crowd.</p>
        <p>Next to us, shaven-headed Internet entrepreneurs reclined in leather armchairs and discussed ''le start-up,'' which they said would be engaged in ''le B-to-B.'' A fashion-industry type in python-skin pants moved toward the bar and ordered a mojito. We decided it was time to move on.</p>
        <p>Our next stop, the Buddha Bar, was not far away, around the corner from the Hotel de Crillon off the Place de la Concorde. Since it opened in 1996, this 1940's Saigon speak-easy on steroids has spawned several other colonial-nostalgia imitators in Paris. One of these, Man Ray -- which includes Johnny Depp among its owners -- now gets more publicity, but I prefer the Buddha Bar.</p>
        <p>After descending a grand staircase, you enter a dimly lighted open space with red-lacquered walls. Dominating it all is a 20-foot-tall statue of Buddha, a brooding presence -- perhaps warning the thin women seated at low tables around him of the dangers of doing anything more than picking at their Asian fusion food.</p>
        <p>But eating is not the reason to go there. It is a comfortable spot for conversation, or just mingling, with enough attitude thrown in to make it feel like Paris. Bigger than the New York establishment of the same name that enjoyed its 15 minutes of fame in the mid-1990's, Paris's Buddha Bar packs in a less exclusive crowd, a mix of visiting young businessmen who want to spend some money and Parisians who might or might not want to meet them.</p>
        <p>On this night, it was the French who seemed to be enjoying themselves the most, particularly when the music shifted from Asian-themed house to North African rai and they got up to dance in the darker corners.</p>
        <p>But by now we were ready for more serious dancing, so we caught a cab up the Champs-Elysees and stopped outside Queen.</p>
        <p>Judging by the setting, it is hard to imagine that this is a ''bad'' club, let alone the baddest in the city. The heavily globalized avenue is about as conventionally bland a place as there is in Paris. The cheesy purple sign over the door hardly distinguishes the club from the theme restaurants that surround it.</p>
        <p>But kitsch is part of the appeal, attracting a part-gay, part-straight crowd that moves quickly past the doorman (except for groups of women, on some nights, I am told).</p>
        <p>Inside, it quickly became clear that we were not at the Disney store. The coat-check boy wagged his tongue at guests. The house music made my eardrums throb. Several women swung from netting covering the dance floor, as a crowd writhed underneath. In the cavernous unisex bathroom, there was evidence of seriously bad behavior.</p>
        <p>I don't know whether Queen is the baddest club in Paris. But after a night of dancing, the worst was yet to come: trying to hail a taxi at 4 a.m., when the Metro stopped running three hours earlier and there are no gypsy cabs. Talk about bad.</p>
