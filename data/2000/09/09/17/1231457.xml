        <p>When Lori Harrigan isn't firing 60-mile-an-hour fastballs, she is a security officer for a casino in Las Vegas. It is the kind of experience that helps one find work for the United States softball team, which has turned home plate and most bases into a no-trespassing zone.</p>
        <p>It was Harrigan's turn in Ralph Raymond's five-woman rotation this morning, and it was business as usual, the no-hitter du jour, as the defending gold medalists shut down Canada, 6-0, in their opening game.</p>

        <p>When Lori Harrigan isn't firing 60-mile-an-hour fastballs, she is a security officer for a casino in Las Vegas. It is the kind of experience that helps one find work for the United States softball team, which has turned home plate and most bases into a no-trespassing zone.</p>
        <p>It was Harrigan's turn in Ralph Raymond's five-woman rotation this morning, and it was business as usual, the no-hitter du jour, as the defending gold medalists shut down Canada, 6-0, in their opening game.</p>
        <p>Harrigan, who is called Vegas and Blackjack by her teammates and who wears No. 21, would have retired all 21 hitters had she not booted an easy ground ball in the first inning.</p>
        <p>''At least I gave up the perfect game,'' she said after settling for the first solo no-hitter in the brief Olympic history of the sport. ''I don't have to blame it on anybody.''</p>
        <p>Talk about dream teams. The United States women have won 111 straight games; the previous 110 included international competition and a 60-game pre-Olympics tour in which its pitchers surrendered a total of four runs and had an earned run average of 0.06.</p>
        <p>Lisa Fernandez, the staff ace, threw five straight perfect games during one stretch, striking out 100 in recording 122 straight outs. She finished that streak by striking out 21 -- that's everyone -- during a game in St. Louis. Harrigan, a left-hander, had a couple of perfect games. Danielle Henderson had the worst E.R.A. during the tour, 0.13.</p>
        <p>''Coach Raymond has standards to uphold,'' said Fernandez, who last gave up an earned run at the world championships -- in 1998. ''One of them is to not let anyone get on base.''</p>
        <p>Despite its pitching, the United States is not a gold medal lock, not with China and especially Australia, the last team to defeat the Americans, in the field. But before any opponents entertain serious thoughts about winning the gold medal, let them first get a hit.</p>
        <p>The Americans also have power, as evidenced today by three home runs. After Sheila Douty gave the United States a 1-0 lead in the home first with a run-scoring single, shortstop Crystal Bustos homered to left-center, with Fernandez aboard. Jennifer Brundage, the third baseman, hit a two-run homer in the fifth. Dot Richardson hit a shot in the sixth.</p>
        <p>Richardson was the unofficial spokeswoman for the Atlanta team, which actually competed in Columbus, Ga., a couple of hours southwest. Here in Australia, the softball women are again out of the loop, in a distant Sydney suburb.</p>
        <p>''Doesn't matter, as long as people come out to watch us play and we get a chance to do our thing,'' said Fernandez, who will probably pitch against Australia in the preliminaries on Thursday. ''We feel we've got the 15 greatest athletes in the sport on this team.''</p>
