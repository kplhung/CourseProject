      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A few years ago, when I moved near Smith Street -- a dusty stretch running through the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Boerum Hill and Carroll Gardens -- it seemed happily mired in the 1950's. Dotted with members-only social clubs and old men playing cards in front of shuttered storefronts, the area felt untouched by the relentless pace of Manhattan life. That's what persuaded me, and many people like me, to trade in a hip downtown address for space, charm and refuge across the river.</p>
        <p>It wasn't an easy decision to make. In New York, more than in most cities, the neighborhood you choose plays a disproportionate role in the persona you project. But not only does the place you live influence the way you develop as a social being; the neighborhoods themselves are ever-changing entities as well, each with its own unfolding narrative. Moving from place to place, we play a kind of identity hopscotch, trying to figure out which area is likely to suit who we are, or who we hope someday to be, before the neighborhood morphs right out from under us and sets us to combing the real estate ads again. When I moved to SoHo, I was out all the time at the chic bistros and lounges that lined every street. But by the time I left for Carroll Gardens, being in the midst of of New York's throbbing nightlife no longer seemed as important; making a home with a measure of grace and quiet did. But those distinctions, as it turned out, weren't as far apart as I had anticipated.</p>

        <p>It wasn't an easy decision to make. In New York, more than in most cities, the neighborhood you choose plays a disproportionate role in the persona you project. But not only does the place you live influence the way you develop as a social being; the neighborhoods themselves are ever-changing entities as well, each with its own unfolding narrative. Moving from place to place, we play a kind of identity hopscotch, trying to figure out which area is likely to suit who we are, or who we hope someday to be, before the neighborhood morphs right out from under us and sets us to combing the real estate ads again. When I moved to SoHo, I was out all the time at the chic bistros and lounges that lined every street. But by the time I left for Carroll Gardens, being in the midst of of New York's throbbing nightlife no longer seemed as important; making a home with a measure of grace and quiet did. But those distinctions, as it turned out, weren't as far apart as I had anticipated.</p>
        <p>Not long after moving, I noticed that a store called Refinery had opened up, a cool handbag shop of the sort you might have seen on Ludlow Street in the early 90's: small, idiosyncratic, lightly overpriced. A block away, there was Astro Turf, specializing in just-above-kitsch home furnishings. Soon came Patois, a small bistro that was the first place in the 'hood that served lettuces other than iceberg and romaine. Then Frida's Closet, where the designer herself sewed sweet little cotton dresses for -- imagine! -- under $200.</p>
        <p>There was just enough gentrification to brighten the area, not enough to attract the tourists. By the end of last year, you could pop out for a microbrew at Quench, stop in for tuna tartare at Saul (or Grocery or Smith Street Kitchen), pick up a funky top at Crush or fall asleep during a myofacial aromatherapy massage at Area. It felt like the right place at the right time, an affordable neighborhood with just enough cachet to feel happening. Maybe things were starting to get a bit precious, but compared with Park Slope, which had gone this route a decade earlier, it was still an arty college town. And compared with Manhattan -- where the streets were clogged with S.U.V.'s, the restaurants filled with 27-year-old paper millionaires -- it was the frontier.</p>
        <p>But then, somehow, the frontier receded, and my quasi-bohemian settlement began feeling less and less like a secret. Marquet Patisserie opened an elegant tea-and-madeleine salon that was indistinguishable from the one in Manhattan. Patois became so popular -- and not just with locals, either -- it expanded into the space next door.</p>
        <p>And then there was Halcyon, a groovy cafe-nightclub-thrift-shop-bar-rec-room that attracted kids from the neighborhood and coolhunters from Manhattan and L.A. to observe them in their native environment. As soon as I saw them I knew it had all gone too far. I waited for the end.</p>
        <p>It came, one summer morning, standing in the dappled sunlight on the corner of President and Smith, tall and blond and eyeing a map: Germans. My sublime little neighborhood had become just another tourist destination, a real estate category, a stop on the party train. It was as if the strip had barreled into awkward, paunchy middle age before it got its braces off.</p>
        <p>I can't begrudge the local businesspeople their successes, or the local landlords, many of whom toughed it out during the 80's when the vacancy rate was 27 percent and the sidewalks were caving in. But how much longer will they be the beneficiaries of this boom? ''What's nice is that it's still local people doing things on this street,'' says Elizabeth Beer, who owns Hoyt &amp; Bond, a mother-child clothing shop. ''But I really worry about the arrival of the chain stores.''</p>
        <p>Even Bette Stoltz, who, as executive director of the South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation, was instrumental in helping the area out of its economic slump, says she feels an occasional pang. ''There's always this fear, as people retire and sell their buildings, that the next property owner, who paid a lot more for the building, needs to make more, gets greedier,'' she says. ''But nothing stays the same. That's the way things are.''</p>
        <p>A year from now, who knows what Smith Street will look like? A town-house condo development is replacing a community garden, and lofts across from an old cheese factory are selling for $600,000. Barring a dot-com implosion, the pressure to create more high-yuppie, kid-friendly services will continue to mount.</p>
        <p>I won't be there to see it. Smith Street has outgrown me. I no longer derive much satisfaction from living among the trendy hordes, and the area no longer qualifies for urban homesteading. Last month I gave up my apartment and found another in a less glamorous part of Brooklyn, one that seems resistant to the forces of runaway gentrification. But I could be wrong. Not far away lurks the Brooklyn Navy Yard. It's an aging blight at the moment, but an aging blight with a waterfront view of the Manhattan skyline, and, perhaps, cause for a twinkle in some developer's eye.</p>
