        <p>Gang of Five</p>
        <p>Leaders at the Center</p>
        <p>of the Conservative Crusade.</p>
        <p>By Nina J. Easton.</p>
        <p>463 pp. New York:</p>

        <p>Last year, the conservative Weekly Standard published a cover story lamenting the decline of hairy chests. The epidemic of hairless men, The Standard asserted, has gnawed at the social fabric, spawning divorces and out-of-wedlock births. This essay embodies an essential component of contemporary conservatism -- the kvetch. In a recent issue of National Review, selected at random, you'd encounter carping about soccer, the Supreme Court and, of course, Jane Fonda.</p>
        <p>Cantankerousness is undoubtedly part of the conservative's job description. But it's odd to hear so much complaining these days. Bill Clinton and his party have conceded that the welfare state is a bad idea. Not even Swedish socialists question the superiority of capitalism. And if that's not enough, conservatives should be gloating over the triumph of anti-Communism, the spread of evangelicalism and the demise of affirmative action. So why do conservatives continue to pose as outmatched rebels when their ideas have become so central? ''Gang of Five,'' Nina J. Easton's group biography of the current crop of conservative leaders, seeks to explain their feelings of embattlement. Her theory: the baby boomers, now the most powerful men in conservative circles, are a different, more contentious breed of right-winger. To understand them, Easton, the co-author, with Ronald Brownstein, of ''Reagan's Ruling Class,'' argues, you need to understand their youths.</p>
        <p>More specifically, you need to understand their college days. They went to college in the heyday of the hippies and imbibed the ''question authority'' spirit of the times. But instead of protesting against Vietnam or burning bras, they rebelled against the 1960's themselves. That is, they rebelled against liberalism's hegemony on campus. Easton writes: ''In their insurrection against the culture of the 1960's left, the baby-boom rightists became its flip side, sharing all of its potential and excess, even all of its pockmarked idealism. The personalities who thrived in the modern right were contrarian, edgy, eager to provoke.'' The ''edgy personalities'' profiled in ''Gang of Five'' are Bill Kristol, editor and publisher of The Weekly Standard; Grover Norquist, Washington's leading libertarian lobbyist; Ralph Reed, the evangelical strategist; Representative David M. McIntosh of Indiana; and Clint Bolick, a lawyer devoted to demolishing affirmative action. All followed basically the same trajectory: after college, they headed off to Washington to enlist in the ranks of the New Right, went to war with liberal Democrats and moderates in their own party, then became field marshals in Newt Gingrich's Republican Revolution and leading opponents of Clintonism.</p>
        <p>Easton's casting is questionable. McIntosh and Bolick are, at least so far, minor figures in the history of conservatism. And she drowns in details about their lives. But she is a superb reporter. Her chapters on Reed's youth vividly portray him as a close approximation of the monster liberals imagine. In his rural Georgia high school, he was known for ''correcting the grammar of black kids.'' Once, he rode in the back of a friend's pickup, shooting blanks, ''laughing his hyena bark as his targets panicked.'' At the University of Georgia, his political tactics earned him the nickname ''tricky Ralph.'' Norquist cuts an even more striking figure. During the 80's, he'd walk around Washington with a bumper sticker on his briefcase that proclaimed ''I'd rather be killing commies.'' Indeed, when he wasn't in Washington, he could often be found traipsing around Angola and Mozambique with (nominally) anti-Communist rebels. A Gingrich protege, he later dispensed important advice to Republican politicians with the same fervor.</p>
        <p>Easton's reporting detail makes it clear why some of her subjects -- despite their outward similarities -- despise each other. The interpersonal rivalries, fascinating in their own right, expose important tensions within the movement. Where libertarians like Norquist fume about the evils of government, neoconservatives like Kristol wouldn't mind exploiting government to achieve social conservative goals. The divide extends to personal style and tactics. Norquist resides in a group house and, in his devotion to the revolution, eschews such conventions as marriage and family; Kristol has a family and suburban home, and fills his staff with married men. Norquist may disdain Communism, but he has tried to organize the right like a Troskyist cell, with his goal ''to make sure that we're all thinking alike and talking alike.'' Kristol happily writes op-ed articles for what Norquist considers ''the liberal media'' -- The New York Times and The Washington Post -- and his magazine will condemn Republican tactics it considers foolish.</p>
        <p>Easton retains a certain empathy for her characters. Never does she slight their accomplishments or treat them as freaks. She applauds Reed's earnest efforts at purging racism from evangelical politics. And when Reed describes his midlife conversion to Christianity, she takes him at his word. More important, she respects the conservative maxim that ideas have consequences. She appreciates that ideologues are motivated by ideology.</p>
        <p>All this terrific reportage, however, cannot obscure Easton's fundamental problem: she lacks an overarching argument. On every page she has interesting things to say, but she never offers a precise diagnosis of the movement. Why has it flourished in the last two decades? Why did it embark on its kamikaze crusade against Clinton? Why would conservatives rally around George W. Bush, when he not so quietly distances himself from them? And there's an even more fundamental problem: the book is based on a specious premise. In the end, Easton's boomercons are not unlike the generations of conservatives before them. They're certainly not any more pugnacious or idealistic than William F. Buckley Jr. and the guys that started National Review in the 1950's. Conservatism has always been obsessed with preserving its ideological purity, dividing the world into ''us'' versus ''them.''</p>
        <p>Easton seems to believe that conservatives can take their medication and suppress their hard-edged politics -- that they can turn ''their momentary gains into a governing majority.'' Perhaps Bush's presidential campaign will prove her right. But to judge from ''Gang of Five,'' it seems doubtful that true conservatives will truly moderate their tone or allow themselves to triangulate on the scale of Bill Clinton. If they look like ideologues, it's because they are.</p>
