        <p>Dr. John W. Rowe, 56, chief executive of Mount Sinai N.Y.U. MedicalCenter and Health System, was cho-sen this month to be president andchief executive of Aetna U.S. Health-care.</p>
        <p>I HAD odd jobs as a student. I worked for the Postal Service, I worked for an office cleaningcompany. I had one really good job, helping a church group with a tour of Europe. Each night, I would read upon where we were going the next day. I remember discussing Cellinis ''Perseus''after having read about it for the first time 12 hours previously. But these jobs were a matter of con-venience during my education andtraining, which was long and rigorous.</p>
        <p>During my internship, I oftenworked all night, every other night.Once I fell asleep at the dinner table,and my wife took a picture of mewith my face in the supper dish.</p>
        <p>My first real job wasn't until 1976, when I was 32 and by then had three children. I got a job as a juniorand the emphasis is on junior faculty member at Harvard Medical School. I was assigned to develop anacademic research and teaching program on aging the first ever. I had my own research laboratory, and I could design and conduct my own experiments. While this was agreat honor, to be made chief of a new unit, the downside was that the initial pay was so bad I couldn't support my family and had to moonlightas a nephrologist at a dialysis clinic.</p>
        <p>It was a steep uphill battle to establish a new area of medicine in aschool that had been around for hundreds of years. I felt like Sisyphus, pushing the rock uphill every day only to have it roll back down. Overtime we built the nation's largest academic research program on aging.</p>
        <p>As for Aetna, it looks very much to me like my first job at Harvard. Health insurance is broken in this country, and we need to re-engineer it. I dont know if it will be like pushing a rock uphill; but if it is, I am prepared.</p>
