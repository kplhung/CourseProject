        <p>OFFICIALS at the Nasdaq stock market have proposed a new system for handling investors' trades in such popular stocks as Cisco Systems, Dell Computer and JDS Uniphase. The question is: Will investors be better off under the system, or will the large brokerage firms that execute their trades be the bigger beneficiaries?</p>
        <p>The answer is of both moment and magnitude. Magnitude, because the Nasdaq plan, if put into effect, will alter the structure of one of the nation's largest securities markets. It is of moment because last Friday was the end of the period in which the Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for public comment on the plan. Now, the S.E.C. must decide whether to approve it.</p>

        <p>OFFICIALS at the Nasdaq stock market have proposed a new system for handling investors' trades in such popular stocks as Cisco Systems, Dell Computer and JDS Uniphase. The question is: Will investors be better off under the system, or will the large brokerage firms that execute their trades be the bigger beneficiaries?</p>
        <p>The answer is of both moment and magnitude. Magnitude, because the Nasdaq plan, if put into effect, will alter the structure of one of the nation's largest securities markets. It is of moment because last Friday was the end of the period in which the Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for public comment on the plan. Now, the S.E.C. must decide whether to approve it.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the proposal has become a battleground. Much of Wall Street, including large brokerage firms like Morgan Stanley and Charles Schwab, favors the plan. Lined up against it are newer industry players like Bloomberg and Instinet, companies that run the increasingly popular alternative trading systems called electronic communications networks, or E.C.N.'s.</p>
        <p>The prospect that the plan will be approved, and the profit consequences for firms trading Nasdaq stocks, may also be behind recent merger deals, in which  companies that trade stocks professionally are combining with large brokerage firms that serve investors. On Monday, Goldman Sachs announced that it was acquiring Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg, the country's third-largest Nasdaq stock-trading firm, for $6.5 billion. Goldman clearly thinks that trading will remain profitable.</p>
        <p>For investors, however, the Nasdaq proposal raises two important issues. Will the new market give investors better access to the best possible prices on their trades? And how will it affect their transaction costs? Critics say the news is bad on both fronts; it could cost investors hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Nasdaq executives say their proposal, which they call the ''Supermontage'' because it displays an expanded number of stock quotations, is a big improvement for investors.</p>
        <p>''It all hangs on best execution,'' said Alfred R. Berkeley III, vice chairman of the Nasdaq stock market. ''We're giving investors a lot of choices -- we allow the investor to go to anyone in the montage.''</p>
        <p>But Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America in Washington, sees flaws. ''It has the potential to benefit investors, but I don't think in its current form it creates the kind of fair and equitable system for orders to interact that investors need,'' she said. ''If you increase transparency and you make it easier for orders to interact, there is a benefit. But right now their system for executing orders includes a number of investor-unfriendly characteristics.''</p>
        <p>Investors, who want to buy and sell stocks easily and at low cost, are always at odds to a degree with intermediaries, who hope to profit either by executing those trades or by providing investor access to other buyers and sellers. In many respects, the better the deal investors receive, the worse the intermediaries do, and vice versa. Nasdaq's predicament is that it must provide a fair and efficient market for investors, while keeping its members and owners, the big brokerage firms that execute investors' trades, happy as well.</p>
        <p>For years, brokers' interests won. An investigation begun in 1994 by the Justice Department and the S.E.C. found that firms trading Nasdaq stocks had conspired for years to keep spreads artificially wide between bid prices (what a seller of a stock receives) and ask prices (what a buyer pays). Orders from customers to buy or sell at certain prices,  called limit orders, were rarely shown to the overall market if they fell between the prevailing bid and ask -- practically guaranteeing that investors never received a better price than brokers wanted to offer.</p>
        <p>BUT in 1996, regulators cracked down on these investor abuses on the Nasdaq stock market, and since then, the balance of power in the market has been shifting slowly away from the traditional brokerage firms. New rules instituted in 1997 required brokers to display customer limit orders, and new electronic networks sprang up that let investors trade with one another without a broker in between pocketing the spread.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the networks' share of stock trading volume rocketed, to 10 percent this year from 4 percent in 1998, while the share controlled by traditional stock exchanges and trading desks at major brokerage firms slid to 60 percent of transactions from 77 percent.</p>
        <p>As more investors traded among themselves, spreads declined, and because networks charge, at most, a  few cents a share for access, investors' trading costs fell. Now, according to some investors, Nasdaq's proposal threatens to undo all that.</p>
        <p>The argument turns on where the bid and ask prices supplied by brokerage firms and networks will appear on the new Nasdaq screen.</p>
        <p>All market participants will be required to send their best bids and asks in all the stocks they trade to Nasdaq for inclusion. But under the proposal, they will not all be handled the same way. Prices from the networks and from other exchanges will sink to the bottom of the screen, where they will presumably attract fewer trades. With E.C.N.'s, this will happen for one of two reasons. The first is Nasdaq's plan to display prices that include E.C.N. access fees, causing E.C.N. prices to appear worse than identical prices submitted by market makers.</p>
        <p>Stock market officials say that because access fees represent a trading cost, they should be included in displayed prices. But Nasdaq has no plans to add in to brokerage firms' prices the commissions or other costs that investors must pay when they trade through them.</p>
        <p>If E.C.N.'s object to this, Nasdaq officials say they would be willing to remove access fees from the quotations. But market maker quotations  would still appear on the screen above those of the E.C.N.'s.</p>
        <p>Deborah Williams, director of research at Meridien, thinks Nasdaq is trying to return to the good old days, when brokerage firms ruled. ''Before the advent of mutual funds and everybody having a brokerage account, the capital at risk in the market was largely the market makers','' she said. ''Maybe then there was a reason for them to have more control over the market. But now the buy-side investor has more at stake, so it's not fair anymore for market makers to have monopolistic control.''</p>
        <p>Big investors, who appreciate that competition has cut their costs, are concerned about the proposal. ''If E.C.N.'s come last, this plays directly into the hands of certain large investment banks that dominate the market-making functions in Nasdaq,'' said Ted Truscott, managing director and co-head of equities at Scudder Kemper Investments, which manages $290 billion in investor funds. ''We want competition to continue.''</p>
        <p>EXECUTIVES at American Century Ventures, a money and mutual fund management company with more than $100 billion under management, make a regular study of transaction costs in their portfolios. The firm trades both through networks and through some 35 brokerage firms. American Century also has stakes in a number of alternate trading systems, including Archipelago ECN.</p>
        <p>Last year, the firm traded $11.6 billion in Nasdaq stocks on the networks, at a cost of just under 1 percent of principal. But the firm's trading with three prominent Wall Street brokerage firms -- Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch -- cost it 2.85 percent of principal.</p>
        <p>Harold Bradley, senior vice president of American Century, said that if the firm had been unable to use the networks, its investors would have paid an extra $220 million in trading costs. ''That's more than the assets under management in the median mutual fund in the U.S.,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Research conducted by Instinet, a Reuters subsidiary that runs the oldest and biggest electronic trading network, has shown that investor orders placed on networks recently represented the best bid and ask price on stocks 48 percent of the time. And 63 percent of the time, either the best bid or the best ask price was to be found on a network.</p>
        <p>The big stock trading firms, meanwhile, like Knight Trading and Mayer &amp; Schweitzer, the Schwab subsidiary, have widened their spreads in recent years. In April 2000, average spreads in the 10 most active Nasdaq stocks at the top 20 market-maker firms amounted to 2.72 percent of principal for a $50 stock or 1.81 percent for a $75 stock. In January 1997, when Nasdaq reform rules went into effect, the same spreads were one-third as wide --  0.97 percent and 0.64 percent.</p>
        <p>Some of this could be a result of the big jump in volatility recently among Nasdaq stocks. Market makers do provide a service to investors by standing ready to buy or sell shares in even the roughest markets.</p>
        <p>Still, without the networks to keep spreads narrow, investors would be hurt, said Douglas M. Atkin, president and chief executive of Instinet. ''I think the Supermontage will have the impact of widening spreads, eliminating choice and ultimately raising costs for investors,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To be sure, Mr. Atkin's firm has perhaps the most to lose if the Nasdaq proposal takes effect. And if all he were doing in opposing the plan was looking out for his own interests, his view would carry little weight. But Instinet has been providing a meeting place for institutional investors since 1971 and has helped investors reduce costs for years while charging a nominal access fee. The network was especially important to its big institutional investor customers during the 1980's and early 1990's, when, regulators say, Nasdaq market makers conspired to keep spreads wide.</p>
        <p>ACCORDING to a study by the Plexus Group, Instinet saved its customers $3 billion last year. It plans to offer small investors access to its market and cost savings later this year.</p>
        <p>Another concern for investors is whether Nasdaq has the technical wherewithal to convert from a collector of prices to an executor of trades. Though Mr. Berkeley said Nasdaq's current execution system, SelectNet, is operating 99.998 percent of the time and consequently is ''as reliable a market as exists in the world.''</p>
        <p>Dana Stiffler, a research analyst at Meridien, said Supermontage would be ''a super leap of faith,'' given the market's history. ''Nasdaq's ability to provide a robust execution platform that can handle big volumes is questionable,'' Ms. Stiffler said.</p>
        <p>Paul Davis, co-head of quantitative portfolio management and trading at TIAA-CREF, is worried about relying on just one system. ''This notion of trying to throw everything down one pipe -- if that pipe breaks, then where are you?'' he asked. ''With an E.C.N. approach, you diversify your technology.'' If the new market is voluntary, investors can go wherever they find the best prices and service. But while officials have said that Supermontage will not be compulsory, others are not sure. Mr. Davis of TIAA-CREF said: ''The real issue is, to what extent is this going to be mandated, and what sort of constraints does it put on E.C.N.'s? Will it stifle creative efforts to bring new technology to the marketplace?'' His worries are shared by Senator Phil Gramm, the chairman  of the Senate Banking Committee.</p>
        <p>To some people, the timing of the proposal is also troublesome, coming while the stock market is still owned  by the National Association of Securities Dealers, a self-regulatory organization, and not after a planned spinoff. Benn Steil, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who is an expert on market structure, said the N.A.S.D. should not be allowed to rig the market before it is spun off. ''What they're doing now is creating a monopoly first.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Roper of the Consumer Federation agreed. ''The N.A.S.D. has ties to a particular market center, and has an interest in preserving a type of market structure,'' she said. ''Can it fairly write the rules that will then govern its competitors? It does look like one of their goals with the Supermontage is to pull volume back away from the E.C.N.'s. That's a perfectly rational motive for a market to have, but it's not necessarily an appropriate position for a regulator.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berkeley says E.C.N.'s are not Nasdaq competitors. ''To us, they are another broker-dealer,'' he said. ''We believe our job is to provide a level playing field for all of them.''</p>
        <p>Such are the issues that face the S.E.C. now. And as is the case with any broad change in market structure, unintended consequences must also be weighed. But, especially given Nasdaq's troubled history, it is an absolute requirement that any new market for its stocks be fair to both investors and competitors.</p>
        <p>MARKET WATCH  Correction:  September 24, 2000, Sunday  The Market Watch column last Sunday, about a Nasdaq proposal for a new system of handling trades, misstated the name of a money and mutual fund management company whose Nasdaq trades on electronic communications networks, known as E.C.N.'s, cost far less than those made through Wall Street brokerage firms. It is American Century Investments; a subsidiary is American Century Ventures.</p>
