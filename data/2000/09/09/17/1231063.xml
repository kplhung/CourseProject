        <p>SLOAN WAINWRIGHT of Katonah has managed to step out of the shadow of her famous family and build a career as a singer-song writer-band leader. Her father, the author Loudon Wainwright, was a long-time Life magazine columnist. Her brother Loudon was hailed 30 years ago as ''the new Bob Dylan'' and has enjoyed a successful career as a singer-songwriter and actor.</p>
        <p>In 1989 Ms. Wainwright, who grew up in Bedford Village, won the Open Mike Finals at the Towne Crier Cafe in Pawling, which led to her first professional date, opening for Shawn Colvin at the Town Crier. She released her eponymous debut CD in 1995, following with ''From Where You Are'' in 1998 (both on the Waterbug label).</p>
        <p>For many years, Ms. Wainwright has been juggling her music career with her day job. Since 1982, she has been a co-owner of the Baker's Cafe on Katonah Avenue, a  coffee-and-muffin shop across the street from the train station in Katonah. Ms. Wainwright has just announced that she is selling her interest to her business partner and sister, Teddy Wainwright.</p>
        <p>One reason Ms. Wainwright decided to sell was to spend time with her family: her husband, George McTavey, and her sons, Sam, 17, and Gabe, 13. Another reason is her busy performance schedule. Her local shows include one next Sunday at the Turning Point in Piermont and an appearance next month, with other performers, at the Towne Crier in ''A Woman's Voice,'' a benefit for the Putnam/Northern Westchester Women's Resource Center.</p>
        <p>Q. What sparked your interest in music?</p>
        <p>A. Music was always enjoyed in our household. My dad was very musical. He wrote songs and was a huge fan of classical, pop and jazz. Everyone had their own turntable in their own room, and there was a stereo in the living room. At any time there could be strains of Glenn Gould, Carole King, the Monkees, the Beatles, Janis Joplin or maybe the Incredible String Band, blending together in the hallways of our house.</p>
        <p>As far as writing songs, it came naturally. It was something that I did for fun as a kid. Write a song about my cat, or my best friend, or my grandmother. My Dad was a writer, and we were somewhat part of that process. My brother is also a natural writer. He started writing songs in '68 and '69. I am sure that as a kid I figured, Hey, that looks like fun . . . I can do that.</p>
        <p>Q. Given your brother's early success, did you intentionally steer clear of anything that would pile on comparisons to him?</p>
        <p>A. I have always done my own thing in regard to my music. I admire my brother so much, and personally I think he is one of the greatest performers and songwriters I have ever seen or heard. Stylistically we are so different.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you think Loudon's success helped or hindered your career?</p>
        <p>A. Being Loudon's youngest sister has been both a help and a hindrance to my music career. We are very different as writers and performers, which is wonderful. I work with a band and he is a solo performer. We write and sing about different types of things. We have different perspectives on the world. We are both personal. I am probably more cryptic, and he is more confessional. I'm a girl, and he's a boy. He's older, I'm younger. Through the years, some audiences have expected me to put on a show that's more like Loudon's, but I have found that mostly, it's not relevant. We are brother and sister. The sibling thing can be a great angle for marketing. Some venues enjoy that.</p>
        <p>Q. Has it been difficult managing both the cafe and your music?</p>
        <p>A. It was always tough to do everything well, but through the years I have received so much support from my husband, my two boys, my sister Teddy and all the women and men at the Baker's Cafe.</p>
        <p>Q. Why are you selling?</p>
        <p>A. I was ready to move on from the cafe. Retail is a wonderful, rewarding and tough business. You have to want to do it to do it well. If you are going to stand behind a counter and serve people, you gotta smile. I had stopped smiling, and I knew it was time to focus on my family and my music. I am ready to come out of the closet as an artist.</p>
        <p>The Sloan Wainwright Band will perform next Sunday at 7 p.m. at the Turning Point, 468 Piermont Avenue, Piermont; (914) 359-1089. On Oct. 13 at 9 p.m. she joins Too Human, a contemporary folk duo: Meg Griffin, Pam Bertoli and others in ''A Woman's Voice,'' a benefit for the Putnam/Northern Westchester Women's Resource Center at the Towne Crier Cafe, Route 22 in Pawling; (845)855-1300.</p>
