      <block class="full_text">
        <p>His arms slicing through the water with languid purpose in the 400-meter freestyle, his size-17 feet kicking up the wake of a paddle-wheel boat, Ian Thorpe won Australia's first gold medal at these Olympic Games and pumped his fists lightly, as if to conserve his energy for a more exuberant celebration.</p>
        <p>An hour later, he squeezed back into his bodysuit and swam the anchor leg to hand the United States its first defeat in the 4x100-meter freestyle relay.</p>
        <p>The Americans were in trouble from the opening leg, when Michael Klim of Australia swam a searing 48.18, breaking the world record for the open 100-meter freestyle.</p>
        <p>On the anchor leg of the relay, Thorpe trailed Gary Hall Jr. by six-tenths of a second at the turn, then caught him in the final meters with a fluid stroke that is nearly nine feet long. With the telescoping reach of someone who is 6 feet 5 inches tall, Thorpe touched the wall just ahead of Hall in the world-record time of 3:13.67, a second and a half below the previous mark of 3:15.11 set by the United States at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.</p>
        <p>Hall, too, breached the former record in 3:13.86, but for the first time, the United States had to settle for second place as the Australian team celebrated.</p>
        <p>Thorpe leapt from the pool into the arms of his teammates, having collected two of the five world records set on one of the greatest nights in swimming history.</p>
        <p>At 17, Thorpe has already been called the swimmer of the century by Don Talbot, coach of the Australian national team. His teenage sense of wariness will not allow him to accept such a pronouncement. After all, Mark Spitz won seven gold medals and set seven world records at the 1972 Summer Games in Munich, Germany.</p>
        <p>But with speed and maturity beyond his years, Thorpe has quickly become one of the top stories of these Games. And after one night, he has perhaps turned a heated swimming rivalry with the Americans in Australia's favor.</p>
        <p>Having won two gold medals, he is favored to collect two more in the 200 freestyle and 4x200-meter relay. Already, he has amassed the frenzied adulation of a country where 80 percent of the population lives near the coast and swimming is a national obsession. Thorpe's accomplishments tonight were startling. He won the 400 freestyle in the world-record time of 3 minutes 40.59 seconds, finishing nearly three seconds ahead of the runner-up, Massimiliano Rosolino of Italy, and a full six seconds ahead of the bronze medalist, Klete Keller of the United States.</p>
        <p>The Americans were not without their successes. The United States women's 4x100 relay team of Amy Van Dyken, Dara Torres, Courtney Shealy and Jenny Thompson took first place and set a world record of 3:36.61. With her sixth career gold medal, all on relays, Thompson now has more Olympic victories than any American woman in any sport. At 33, Torres became the oldest female swimmer in history to win a gold medal.</p>
        <p>The cascade of records began tonight when Yana Klochkova of Ukraine set a world mark of 4:33.59 to win the women's 400-meter individual medley, bettering her career best by five seconds.</p>
        <p>But the stage belonged to Thorpe. As he entered the pool deck for the 400 freestyle at the Sydney International Aquatic Center, the 17,500 in attendance let out a throbbing roar, and cameras flashed like strobe lights. A spectator with a giant foam hand led the cheer: ''Aussie, Aussie, Aussie! Oi! Oi! Oi!'' Some in the crowd waved national flags, others waved flags with the combative symbol of a boxing kangaroo.</p>
        <p>''Thorp-ee, Thorp-ee, Thorp-ee!'' the crowd serenaded the teenager, whose nickname is the Thorpedo.</p>
        <p>''As soon as I walked out there, it was like a gladiator walking into the Colosseum, hearing the sheer noise of the crowd,'' Thorpe said. ''I was ready to race.''</p>
        <p>He wore a bodysuit that extended from his neck to his wrists and ankles, making himself more buoyant and hydrodynamic. The popularity of the innovative and controversial bodysuits with swimmers is expected to result in a tidal wave of world record and Olympic records here. In fact, all five world records registered on this first day of the swimming competition were set by swimmers wearing some version of the new suits.</p>
        <p>Thorpe did not seem to need any help. As soon as his long form knifed into the water, the race was essentially over. The pool here is built for fast times with two open lanes, a special gutter system and wide lane ropes to dissipate waves and calm turbulence. A steep bank of bleachers lends a pulsing home-pool advantage. Thorpe's calm, powerful stroke took care of the rest.</p>
        <p>After one lap, his lead had already reached a second. So attenuated is his reach that Thorpe needs only 12 strokes to navigate the 50 meters from one end of the pool to the other. His kick is so powerful that other swimmers dread the turbulence that roils from his lane. He reached the finish, pumped his fists, then finally climbed from the pool and raised his arms above his head as the noisy celebration engulfed him. It was hard to believe that as a young boy he had been allergic to chlorine.</p>
        <p>''I think he was born to swim,'' said Rosolino, who finished an unthreatening second in 3:43.40.</p>
        <p>Later, Thorpe was back in the pool for the 4x100 relay. Even with Klim's opening split -- which, because it was a leadoff split, with a start from the blocks, also counted as an open world record -- Thorpe had only a narrow edge as he dived into the pool ahead of Hall, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist in the 100 freestyle.</p>
        <p>Hall is considered the stronger sprinter, and he quickly reeled Thorpe in, taking a lead of half a body length into the final turn.</p>
        <p>It was not enough.</p>
        <p>With a relaxed, tranquil stroke that belied the fierce power in his legs and flipper-like feet, the Australian kept gaining ground, drawing even and finally touching the wall with a confident lunge. Without looking at the clock, he knew he had won, and he sprang from the pool.</p>
        <p>Hall had promised his opponents that the Americans would ''smash them like guitars,'' but it was the Australians who won instead and celebrated with a mocking concert of air guitars.</p>
        <p>''The last 50 meters were rather painful,'' Hall said. ''I went after it. This is the Olympics, all or nothing. I doff my swimming cap to the great Ian Thorpe. He had a better finish than I had.''</p>
        <p>There had been enormous pressure on Thorpe to win. The proclamation by his coach. The mural-sized photographs of his face on downtown buildings. The ubiquitous advertising campaigns for a bank and phone, cereal and automobile companies. The realization that only a gold medal can bring true greatness for an Australian swimmer.</p>
        <p>''To be able to dream and to fulfill it is the best thing an individual can do,'' Thorpe said. ''It's amazing to be in this situation and to perform well. I'm one of the select few athletes who have performed at their best at the Olympic Games. The statistics on that are very slim. It's one of the things I wanted to do.''</p>
        <p>The best ever? Not yet, he said. But not out of reach, either.</p>
        <p>''It's going to take a lot of top performances on my behalf,'' Thorpe said. ''It's not something I can justify. It's something I'm not willing to accept until I achieve a little more than I have now. But two gold medals, it's quite mind boggling.''</p>
