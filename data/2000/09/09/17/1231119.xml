        <p>FACED with rising student populations and inadequate or aging school buildings, both the Harrison and Hastings-on-Hudson school districts recently announced efforts to handle the problem.</p>
        <p>In Harrison, residents will be asked to authorize spending $1.04 million over the next three years in a bond referendum Oct. 12 to buy an eight-classroom modular building for the Louis M. Klein Middle School.</p>
        <p>''We're growing by 200 to 250 students a year for the next five years,'' said Dr. Donald Howard, the Harrison school district superintendent. ''The community understands that we need it. There's a concern that we will have to do more.''</p>
        <p>He added that the modular unit is expected to last 50 years and would be ready for occupancy by Sept. 1, 2001, with the possibility that it might be ready by April.</p>
        <p>At the Sept. 25 school board meeting in Hastings, board members will  analyze a report that evaluated the conditions of the school buildings and determine which projects should be presented to the community for action.</p>
        <p>The report recommended $10 million worth of repairs. Among other items, the report said, roofs needed to be replaced, electrical systems should be upgraded and windows should be replaced.</p>
        <p>''We'll have 1,800 students by 2005,'' said Dr. John J. Russell, superintendent of the Hastings-on-Hudson school district. ''We're not surprised by the numbers. This is how we do business. It's part of our strategic planning process.</p>
        <p>''With the programs that we have in place, we know the actual space in our buildings can handle the increased enrollment. We know that we need to replace the roofs on our buildings, replace windows, replace the heating and ventilation systems and repair masonry. We know that we need more space for athletic fields.''</p>
        <p>Updating the district's science laboratories and air-conditioning the classrooms are also possibilities, Dr. Russell said, adding, ''The next logical step is for the board to determine the priorities, and have input from the community.''</p>
