        <p>TAKE my S.U.V. -- please.</p>
        <p>Ba-dum-bum.</p>
        <p>I tell ya, my crossover vehicle is so ugly, when I drove it through Scarsdale they put a paper bag over its hood.</p>
        <p>Ba-dum-bum.</p>
        <p>Seriously, folks, a few days in the Pontiac Aztek and you'd act like Rodney Dangerfield, too. You think you get no respect? Once, pulling into a mall in upstate New York, I saw a young woman in a Corolla catch her first glimpse. Her eyes grew impossibly wide, her jaw dropped, her finger pointed and she guffawed uncontrollably.</p>
        <p>All I could think was, ''Is she laughing with me, or at me?''</p>
        <p>In truth, I expected worse. To my eyes, the Aztek isn't just homely but, as a friend observed, ''is capable of serious retinal damage.'' It breaks every aesthethic rule from the Golden Mean to ''less is more.''</p>
        <p>Yet behind the wheel, I was surprised at the relatively tepid reaction it received on the streets. Sure, some people stared and grimaced. Others cast nervous sideways glances, as they would at the scene of a gruesome accident. But in the main, motorists did not seem to find the Aztek particularly noteworthy, and for a vehicle intended to be ''polarizing'' (a word used by Pontiac executives), that may be the unkindest cut.</p>
        <p>Driving one of first New Beetles in New York, I literally stopped traffic. The Audi TT halted all conversation at a trendy sidewalk cafe downtown. The PT Cruiser got thumbs-ups and horn toots wherever it went. The Aztek didn't come close to any of that.</p>
        <p>A reader wrote to AutoWeek magazine to say of the Aztek: ''It's stunning -- as in, hit in the head with a brick.'' But is it truly ugly? To test reactions, I conducted unscientific surveys of two groups. First, I polled by e-mail a group of auto writers and journalists who cover the industry, who are presumably familiar with most cars on the market. And second, I spent much of my time with the test vehicle passing out surveys to regular people who got a close-up look.</p>
        <p>I asked the journalists, quite simply, to list what they considered the five ugliest new vehicles in America. Their choices included some surprises, including the TT, the Cadillac DeVille and the Subaru Forester.  (One woman nominated ''all Ferraris'' and a man countered with ''all Rolls-Royces.'') But a consensus emerged:</p>
        <p>1. Pontiac Aztek</p>
        <p>2. Chevrolet Monte Carlo</p>
        <p>3. Toyota Echo</p>
        <p>4. Hyundai Tiburon</p>
        <p>5. Chevrolet Impala</p>
        <p>The Aztek was the clear winner, rated the most ugly vehicle by 11 of the 15 respondents; for emphasis, many added ''without question'' or ''hands down.''</p>
        <p>And what about the people surveyed on the street? To my surprise, more than half gave its styling a ''5'' -- the ''most favorable'' rating on a scale of 1 to 5. The rest graded it with a smattering of 4's, 3's and 2's. No one gave it a 1, or ''least attractive.'' Several volunteered comments like ''cool,'' ''phat,'' ''comfortable.''</p>
        <p>After conducting these exercises, I cannot really say what they proved. Perhaps the auto writers -- a middle-aged group, only a quarter of whom were women -- are more conservative than the public. Perhaps, as professional cynics, they are less impressed by the Aztek's flash and dazzle.</p>
        <p>And the people surveyed on the street were probably not representative of the car-buying public. Most filled out the survey after they approached the Aztek on their own, or at least showed a bit of interest in it, so they might have been predisposed to be favorable. They were overwhelmingly male and young and, based on appearances at least, unlikely to spend $27,835 on a crossover minivan. Too, most of the surveys were conducted in upstate towns where aesthetic sensibilities may be different than in SoHo or San Francisco.</p>
        <p>And what was my personal conclusion about the Aztek? To my surprise, I found it pleasant, useful and far more fun than a minivan. I especially liked the outward visibility, which benefits from a low-cut two-piece rear window, and the respectable stereo system, with an in-dash CD changer and excellent controls (on the dash, on the steering wheel, in the backseat and in the cargo area). The ride is comfortable and quiet, though I wonder how the cabin will sound in frigid weather when the plastic bins, coolers and compartments rub together.</p>
        <p>In any case, the Aztek looks much better from inside. For one thing, you don't have to look at the styling.</p>
