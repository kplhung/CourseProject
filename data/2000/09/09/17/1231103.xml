        <p>THIRTY years ago, motorists driving north on Carleton Avenue past Central Islip State Hospital would have seen vacant and vandalized red-brick buildings and just up the street, abandoned and burned-out houses.</p>
        <p>Now, drivers along this same stretch of road see a new gleaming white federal courthouse, a brick county court complex and just up the road, a new shopping center that's taking shape.</p>
        <p>''I have seen changes in Central Islip that are unbelievable,'' said Judge Leonard Wexler of United States District Court, who acted as liaison in the construction of the new federal building. ''Just across the street and a little north of here, they are putting in a large shopping center with a multiplex cinema. They are also renovating an old hospital and making it into an office building. Other new office buildings have gone up, and investors are buying up property around here and making improvements. A tremendous change has come over the area.''</p>
        <p>Nancy Manfredonia, the executive director of the Central Islip Civic Council, said the the federal courthouse, along with the adjacent Suffolk County court complex, the new stadium where the Long Island Ducks play and the new movie theater, has helped to turn Central Islip around.</p>
        <p>''I don't think Central Islip ever expected to be a tourist attraction, but we sure are,'' she said. ''The Long Island Ducks have made a big splash and have been very successful. Almost all its games were sold out. And people have been dying for a local movie theater. Now we won't have to go to Commack, Patchogue or Smithtown.''</p>
        <p>Much of this and other new development is happening on what had been the 788-acre site of the Central Islip State Hospital, which at its peak in the 1950's had as many as 10,000 patients. The 107-year-old hospital had been the lifeblood of the community, but after decades of deinstitutionalization, by 1994 the hospital had only 200 patients. The state has kept a core of about 100 acres at Central Islip, and as other psychiatric hospitals nearby were closed, it transferred patients here.</p>
        <p>After the state began closing hospital buildings in the mid-1960's, it transferred 376 acres to the Town of Islip as part of an urban renewal project in 1977. Five years later, the town sold 356 acres to the New York Institute of Technology, which has recycled two dozen of the smaller hospital buildings for its use. Over the years, the institute has bought more hospital property from the state, for a total of 506 acres.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Touro College in Manhattan bought another 13 acres from the state for $1.5 million and plans to relocate its law school, now in Huntington. to the new site by 2002.</p>
        <p>''I've been watching Central Islip for the last five or six years, and it's amazing what's going on there,'' the school's dean, Howard Glickstein,  said. ''There promises to be a lot more commercial development. It's inevitable that with more employees and students in the area, the community is going to need more shops and restaurants.''</p>
        <p>Judge Wexler estimated that 1,000 people a day will come to the federal courthouse. once the building is fully staffed. The $190 million, 850,000-square-foot-building, designed by Richard Meier &amp; Partners, working with the Spector Group of North Hills, is one of the largest courthouses in the nation. Although the first trial was held there last month, Judge Wexler said the United States attorney's offices would not move from Hauppauge and Garden City until mid-October. The 11-story building will be dedicated Oct. 16.</p>
        <p>This is the first time the Federal government has owned its own courthouse on Long Island, and all federal courts will be consolidated here from rented space in Westbury, Hauppauge and Uniondale.</p>
        <p>Walking through the new courthouse, the judge showed off the woodwork in the courtrooms, birch in one and cherry in others. ''Notice how the grain flows in each piece of wood so that it matches up, just as it came from the tree,'' he said. ''It looks expensive, but it really isn't. Wood is wood -- it's just what you do with it.''</p>
        <p>As Judge Wexler walked into the ninth-floor hallway, he stopped and looked out the windows on either side. ''This is my favorite spot in the building,'' he said. ''Looking to the north you can see a good amount of Long Island. Looking to the south, you can see Fire Island, the Great South Bay, Robert Moses bridge, the lighthouse and the ocean.''</p>
        <p>He said that with the help of his wife, Barbara, an interior designer and painter, he and the General Services Administration selected Mr. Meier as the architect.</p>
        <p>The building received mixed reviews from some lawyers who visited last month. Jonathan Sinnreich of Hauppauge called it a monstrosity. ''I think it's ugly and totally out of context,'' he said. ''It's sterile and completely inappropriate.''</p>
        <p>JoAnn Bodmer of Hauppauge said: ''From the beach, it sticks out like a sore thumb.'. I was hoping that when you go inside there would be something embracing about it, something that would give it a warm and fuzzy feeling. But it didn't happen.  It's sterile and cold.''</p>
        <p>Lisa Green, a spokeswoman for the Meier firm in Manhattan, disagreed with the critics. ''The architecture clearly expresses the importance and dignity of the judicial branch,'' she said, ''while at the same time being a welcoming and open building for both visitors and those who work there daily.''</p>
        <p>Although the courthouse may be the most visible symbol of the new Central Islip, other more mundane buildings may take on more importance for the people who live and work here. Jules Demchick, the president of the J. D. Carlisle Development Corporation of Manhattan, which is building the shopping center, to be called the Town Center of Central Islip, north of the courthouse, said, ''We saw that a lot of things were going to happen at that one site, and we felt it was a good place for a shopping center.''</p>
        <p>King Kullen and the 20-screen, 4,400-seat multiplex will serve as the center's anchors, he said, and there will be as many as six restaurants, a video store, a pharmacy and an electronics store.</p>
        <p>Martin R. Cantor, a consultant to the Central Islip Main Street Alliance, sees a bright economic future for the area. ''The movie theater is planning on one million ticket purchases a year from a 12 1/2-mile radius,'' he said, ''and the Long Island Ducks intend to bring in an average of 357,000 people. So from those two venues, you will bring in 1.4 million people who will hopefully spend money while they are here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Demchick said his company was negotiating to buy property near the federal courthouse to build a hotel with a maximum of 225 rooms.</p>
        <p>It may be facing some competition. Russell Mohr, the director of sales and leasing for Benjamin Development in Garden City, said that  his company was negotiating with two hotel chains to open a seven-story, 140-room hotel with three restaurants on a nine-acre site at Courthouse Drive and Carleton Avenue. The plans would require town approval.</p>
        <p>The hotel site is part of a 52-acre parcel a Benjamin subsidiary, the Arlen Contracting Corporation, bought from the state for $2.2 million last February. Located just north of the Cohalan court complex and adjacent to the ballpark, it includes six  buildings from the psychiatric hospital, totaling 900,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>One of the buildings, the former medical and surgical building on 11 acres on Carleton Avenue, is being renovated as a 175,000-square-foot office building, the Courthouse Corporate Center. Mr. Mohr said the building would be ready in the first quarter of 2001.</p>
        <p>The hospital building Arlen is renovating is within a 1.6-square-mile economic development zone created to provide tax incentives to lure businesses to Central Islip and to encourage those there to expand.  ''The incentives involve sales taxes, income taxes, franchise tax credits and rebates,'' said William G. Mannix, the director of economic development for the Town of Islip.</p>
        <p>In the previously blighted residential area north of the former hospital grounds, the town and private investors in recent years built single-family homes on the west side of Carleton Avenue, known as College Woods, and town houses on the other side in a development called Park Row.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Parker, a private investigator who moved to Park Row two years ago, said he welcomed the federal courthouse and the development. ''It will increase real estate prices and bring in more professionals here,'' he said. ''This is becoming the jewel of Long Island.''</p>
