        <p>There is nothing easy about going out for an evening in London. Sure you can always belly up to the bar at the local pub, but painting the town red here takes much more effort than that.</p>
        <p>Almost in a throwback to the old British penchant for classifying people by aristocratic pedigree, when you line up behind the velvet rope, it doesn't matter how primped you look; the bouncer doesn't care. The real question: Are you a member?</p>
        <p>London's hottest bars and clubs are for members only and that means being a celebrity, knowing one, or anteing up as much as $3,000 a year after being nominated by another member -- and seconded -- just to get your foot in the door.</p>
        <p>For the tourist passing through town, hitting the hottest spots can be a risky, though thrilling endeavor. And for those less adventurous, there are still a number of good places to try without the hassle of having to be or look like Claudia Schiffer.</p>
        <p>After dinner or the theater in the West End, a good place for a drink is Mezzo, a relatively low-key bar and restaurant in Soho. One of Sir Terrance Conran's ever-expanding number of overly designed bars and restaurants around town, Mezzo is a bit luxurious without a sense of arrogance. The expansive bar on the first floor has an eclectic mix, from 20-somethings in jeans to 60-year-olds in suits. It's easy to feel comfortable, unless you like dimmer lighting.</p>
        <p>For something a bit more exclusive, try  the Purple Bar inside Ian Schrager's newest London hotel, Sanderson. It will take a little work to talk your way in -- if you're not a hotel guest, get there really early -- because the bar is normally for members only.</p>
        <p>Once inside this small purple temple of chic arrogance, order a classic martini -- no fruit martinis -- or vodka, though everything is expensive ($10 or more a drink). With Frank Sinatra playing in the background, the Purple Bar is a great people-watching place, especially if you care which people you're watching. If you'd rather leave celebrity watching to the cable channel E!, go to Mezzo.</p>
        <p>For a bit of dancing while you drink, make your way to the Notting Hill Arts Club in the heart of Notting Hill. Catering to a distinctly younger set -- 20's and 30's -- the club has a steady stream of cool D.J.'s spinning house and garage music into the early morning, with a different theme each night. In a huge  basement, the club seems a bit grungy, but attracts a very attractive clientele. And it's not impossible to get past the bouncer.</p>
        <p>If your goal is to dance into the night, go to a club like China White, near Soho, or Heaven, north of Piccadilly Circus. It will be helpful to get on the guest list for either place, so creativity counts. You can try calling ahead and citing some business affiliation or a local connection you might have. A concierge at a trendy hotel can help, too.</p>
        <p>Both are multifloor extravaganzas, filled with thumping music that doesn't stop until the sun comes up. These clubs are great for getting sweaty with beautiful people, but don't expect meaningful conversation.</p>
        <p>A note about getting home: The subway stops running at midnight. Your only choices after that, until about 5:30 a.m,, when it resumes service, are a bus or taxi. Both are extremely hard to come by in the early morning hours, and gypsy cabs are not a good idea.</p>
        <p>The easiest way to ensure a ride home is to take the telephone number of an authorized radio taxi company with you. And yes, even the taxi company will ask when you call: Are you a member?</p>
        <p>Mezzo, 100 Wardour Street; (44-207) 314-4000. Reservations required. Cover, $7.25 for music downstairs, at $1.45 to the pound.</p>
        <p>Sanderson, 50 Berners Street; (44-207) 300-1444. Free admission.</p>
        <p>The Notting Hill Arts Club, 19 Notting Hill Gate, (44-207) 460-4459. Admission, $4.35 before 8 p.m., $7.25 after.</p>
        <p>China White, 6 Air Street, (44-207) 343-0040. Closed Sunday. Admission, $21.75.</p>
        <p>Heaven, Under the Arches off Villiard Street, near Charing Cross Station; (44-207) 930-2020. Closed Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday. Admission, $1.50 to $17.50.</p>
