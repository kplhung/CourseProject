        <p>The Commack Cougars pulled off the first upset of the Long Island season yesterday, upending Brentwood, the defending Class I champion, 29-14.</p>
        <p>The visiting Cougars (1-0), who missed the playoffs last year with a 2-6 record, were led by Mike Prahalis, the senior quarterback, and Bryan Tornee, the senior wide receiver, who have been teammates since they played together in the Police Athletic League as fifth graders. Prahalis threw three touchdown passes to Tornee and four over all.</p>
        <p>The game turned on a late defensive stop by Commack. With 3 minutes 18 seconds remaining, Brentwood trailed by 21-14 and faced fourth-and-2. Tom Blumenauer, Brentwood's junior quarterback, fumbled the snap, recovered it and got tackled behind the line of scrimmage.</p>
        <p>On Commack's ensuing drive, Prahalis found Tornee in the end zone for the third time and then again on a 2-point conversion to secure the victory and snap Brentwood's 11-game winning streak.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, three runners rushed for 100 yards as Great Neck North (1-0) defeated Roslyn (0-1), 42-0. Joel Sussmanran, the senior quarterback, rushed for 160 yards and 2 touchdowns and added 15 tackles on defense for the victor.</p>
        <p>Bellport (1-0), the top-rated team in Division 2 in Suffolk County, flexed its muscles and pummeled Copiague (0-1), 69-18. Five turnovers and a blocked punt helped stake the Clippers to a 55-6 halftime advantage. Desmond Dent, a touted senior tailback, rushed for four short-yardage touchdowns in the first half.</p>
        <p>In Sachem's 33-14 opening-day victory over Central Islip, the Flaming Arrows received big performances from Jason Kling (18 carries for 72 yards and one touchdown), Matt Rickert (12 carries for 109 yards) and quarterback Joe Guilliano (12 of 21 for 121 yards and one touchdown).</p>
        <p>Onyi Momah rushed 15 times for 180 yards and 3 touchdowns as John Glenn (1-0) posted a 34-18 victory over South Hampton (0-1).</p>
        <p>Vinny Valente and Chris Bretton scored two touchdowns apiece as Bethpage (1-0) routed Seaford (0-1), 51-0.</p>
        <p>P.S.A.L.</p>
        <p>The Lincoln Railsplitters (2-0), led by Mike Pierre and Kamar Cousins on offense and Dan Primus and Keith Williams on defense, cruised to a 28-0 victory over Jefferson (0-2). Cousins, a junior tailback, rushed for 155 yards and 2 touchdowns on 17 carries. Pierre, a senior quarterback, completed 4 of 6 passes for 102 yards and was responsible for two touchdowns and a pair of 2-point conversions.</p>
        <p>Primus, a 6-foot-4-inch, 330-pound defensive tackle who is being recruited by Syracuse, Michigan State and Penn State, recorded 18 tackles, and Williams, a defensive end, had 10 tackles and 5 sacks.</p>
        <p>Nazareth (1-1) scored all of its points on defensive plays in an 18-0 victory over Far Rockaway. Collymore Samuel, a senior defensive tackle, registered a safety in the second quarter; Anthony Prescott, a senior linebacker, returned a blocked field-goal attempt 70 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter; and Keith Murray returned an interception 40 yards for Nazareth's final score in the fourth.</p>
        <p>John Jay (1-0) broke a 6-6 tie with 2:37 left when quarterback Jerole Wilson connected with O'Neil Russel for a 70-yard score to secure a 12-6 victory over Midwood (1-1).</p>
        <p>C.H.S.F.L.</p>
        <p>Holy Cross (2-0), behind a strong ground game, defeated Holy Trinity (1-1), the defending AA champion, 34-13. Holy Cross's attack was keyed by the junior running back Woody Aimee (18 carries for 121 yards and 3 touchdowns) and Dwayne Franklin (12 carries for 130 yards).</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>Mike Weber booted what proved to be the game-winning extra point with 8:48 remaining to propel Cedar Grove (1-0) to a 7-6 victory over Mountain Lakes (0-1). Cedar Grove's Mark Zambrano (14 carries for 85 yards) provided the game-tying score by diving into the end zone from 1 yard.</p>
        <p>New Providence (1-0) capitalized on four special-teams miscues and a turnover in its 55-0 rout of Jonathan Dayton. Stewart Clyde's two touchdowns were set up by Dayton mistakes.</p>
        <p>Rikki Cook, who has orally committed to attend Virginia, rushed for 112 yards and 4 touchdowns on 25 carries as Montclair (1-1) crushed Barringer (0-2), 34-7.</p>
        <p>Delbarton (2-0), led by the junior tailback Mike Defazio (two touchdowns) and the senior linebacker Joe Albarelli (nine tackles and a forced fumble), defeated Clifford Scott (1-1), 35-0.</p>
        <p>WESTCHESTER</p>
        <p>Matt Bernstein, a Wisconsin-bound fullback, rushed for 178 yards and 2 touchdowns on 20 carries as Edgemont (2-0) beat Briarcliff (1-1), 50-7.</p>
        <p>PREPS</p>
        <p>Hackley (2-0), sparked by the strong play of Patrick McDermott, Darrel Swann and Casey Hilpert, made easy work of Brunswick of Greenwich, Conn., 31-0. McDermott, a senior quarterback, completed 11 of 22 passes for 184 yards, including a 26-yard scoring strike to Swann, the team's leading ground gainer (11 carries for 103 yards). Hilpert rushed for two scores.</p>
