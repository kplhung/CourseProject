        <p>IN the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, the ancient Greek epic of the Trojan War is being played out in all its gore and anguish. On an open stage littered with dirt and debris, against a background of hand-painted slide projections of smoke, rain and wind, ancient passions are coming to life. Chilling scenes of murder, capture and enslavement take place on an immense disc covered with sand and surrounded by reflective black walls. Rocks and driftwood are scattered about, along with statuary: the eyes of Zeus and the broken head of Apollo. And in one climactic scene Troy burns and the surviving women, screaming with pain, are branded before our eyes, while Hecuba, the defeated Trojan queen, ferociously buries her murdered son with her bare hands.</p>
        <p>These images of the Trojan War and its aftermath are seen in ''Tantalus,'' a 10 1/2-hour cycle of plays, with music and dance, that is having its premiere here on Oct. 21. Adapted from an original text in verse by John Barton, a leading British theater scholar and teacher, ''Tantalus'' is being staged by the distinguished British director Sir Peter Hall.</p>
        <p>Sir Peter is a man who relishes challenges. He has directed hundreds of productions all over the world, including operas and Greek and Shakespearean drama cycles. Now, at age 70, he is undertaking another bold venture, one that follows the trend in recent decades of marathon productions by master directors. If the theatergoing public's response to such lengthy, and inventive, presentations is any indication -- witness the enthusiasm for Peter Stein's 18-hour version of Goethe's ''Faust,'' Peter Brook's ''Mahabharata,'' Shi-Zheng Chen's ''Peony Pavilion,'' Ariane Mnouchkine's ''Atrides'' and the works of Robert Wilson -- ''Tantalus'' is bound to provoke a good deal of interest, especially since it offers a new take on a venerable myth.</p>
        <p>In tackling this enterprise, Sir Peter has assembled a cast of 18 American and 4 British actors; a Greek stage and mask designer (Dionyssis Fotopoulos); a Japanese lighting designer (Sumio Yoshii); an Irish composer (Mick Sands) and an African-American choreographer (Donald McKayle). Edward Hall, his son, is co-director. By mid-summer, preparations for the opening were well under way, and Sir Peter and the cast, who had been rehearsing nine hours a day for four months, were deep into the work.</p>
        <p>After a rehearsal, Sir Peter, still full of energy, retired to his office for an interview. ''The Greeks and their philosophy have always fascinated me,'' he said. ''I like them because they've always asked a lot of questions and had the temerity not to give many answers. And I love that. They are about ambiguity and contradiction. That's why I like their invention of many gods. If one isn't working for you, you try another one.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''The thing is to endure with a certain amount of nobility, a certain stoicism, and a certain amount of charity. And I think these are still pretty good values. Greek myths are rattling good stories, and they are absolutely at the center of our political and psychological thinking, our ideas about family and power, men and women, war and peace.''</p>
        <p>Sponsored by the Denver Center for the Performing Arts in association with the Royal Shakespeare Company, ''Tantalus'' runs here through Dec. 2 and will tour England beginning in January, ending at the Royal Shakespeare's Barbican Theater in London. The opening performance, as well as three others during the Denver run, will be one-day marathons; the others will take place over two consecutive days. To accompany the performances, the Denver Center will mount a multimedia exhibition on the history of classical Greek theater; there will also be a symposium featuring specialists on ancient Greek culture.</p>
        <p>The Denver Center became the venue for ''Tantalus'' because of the determination of its founder and executive director, Donald R. Seawell, a longtime admirer of Sir Peter. The center, a nonprofit organization with a substantial endowment, was among the original group of producers of ''Tantalus.'' When that original collaboration broke up, Mr. Seawell, convinced that ''Tantalus'' was a ''great work of theater,'' stepped in.</p>
        <p>''When Don Seawell offered me the deal,'' Sir Peter said, ''I told him he couldn't do it because it would cost about $8 million, and he said, 'That's fine.' '' It was an offer Sir Peter could not refuse. The center is one of the world's largest performing arts complexes, occupying four city blocks, with ample rehearsal space, a mask room, a designer's workshop, apartments to house actors, a large theater and a willing and experienced staff. ''What Don has done,'' Sir Peter said, ''is given me the facilities to do something crazy. Of course it's crazy. But 'Tantalus' is something totally different. These stories could be richer than anything I ever worked on.''</p>
        <p>''Tantalus'' is a fresh version of the Trojan War and its origins. Instead of working from Homer's ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey,'' Mr. Barton has dealt largely with surviving summaries of a lost ancient Greek work known as the ''Epic Cycle,'' a saga of Troy and of Agamemnon's family, written before the age of classical Greek drama. Basing his project on this and other ancient sources and mythic traditions, Mr. Barton offered his own view of the most intriguing legend in Western culture, one that has permeated plays, operas, dance and literature through the ages.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barton does take the ''Iliad'' as his starting point, but travels a different path. The ''Iliad'' begins during the war, with the Greeks camped before Troy; their aim is to avenge the abduction of Helen, wife of the Spartan King Menelaus, by Paris, son of the Trojan King Priam. Homer concentrates on the great quarrel between the Greek hero Achilles and the Greek general Agamemnon, the horrific battles, and the combat between the Trojan prince Hector and Achilles. He ends with the funeral of Hector.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barton's version (which has additional text by Colin Teevan) goes further, dramatizing events before, during and after the war. The story begins and ends in our own time. In a prologue, a group of contemporary young women on a beach in Greece meet a storyteller who recounts the Trojan War. The women enter into the tale, acting as the chorus, and the ancient drama begins. In an epilogue, the young women reappear to interpret the war's outcome. The saga is divided into three parts, the Outbreak of the War, the War and the Homecomings, each of which contains three short plays; a final play brings the total to 10. Each deals with a different central character.</p>
        <p>The main focus is on the characters' psychological and philosophical attitudes, their complex motivations. Against the common legend, Agamemnon is depicted as a humanist who never wanted to fight the war; his daughter Iphigenia, anxious to obey the goddess Artemis's demand that Agamemnon sacrifice her, asks for her death. Hector's wife, Andromache, falls in love with her vicious captor, Neoptolemus, and she has a long discussion about love and marriage with Hermione, his wife. Odysseus, the wily general, favors the war and is primarily interested in capturing the Trojan gold, though he is kind to the vanquished Queen Hecuba and the other Trojan women; Cassandra gives herself to Agamemnon in a compelling, sexy scene; and whether Helen was ever in Troy or whether Iphigenia was really Agamemnon's daughter are left open to question.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Barton, who has attempted to modernize the characters and make them more accessible to us, most of them are neither heroes nor villains. Some are merely killers; others try to avert the war and then regret the bloodbath that follows; still others view the entire war with wit and irony. Ultimately, however, the fatal outcome is the same for all.</p>
        <p>''I do not vouch for John's accuracy with the facts,'' Sir Peter said. ''You can argue with him about it. You can say you don't believe Agamemnon was a liberal, a humanist, and tried not to kill people. But the Greeks have always been reinterpreted by others. Plays have been written based on Homer and other myths, and there have been many disagreements, even among the Greeks themselves. Look at Aeschylus and Euripides. In the end, the audience will make up its own mind.''</p>
        <p>What is important for Sir Peter and Mr. Barton are the contemporary ramifications of the story -- the corruption of power and politics. The Agamemnon-Odysseus argument for and against the war is about how to justify war and whether one should behave like a criminal in order to win. Embedded in the text are eternal questions: Why do men lust for power? What causes jealousy and hate? What is the relationship between slave and master, between destiny and choice, between the demands of the military code of honor and the instincts of ferocity and greed? Yet, doubts and contradictions notwithstanding, the war and its brutality could not be avoided. The tragedy of the conflict remains.</p>
        <p>Sir Peter's staging emphasizes that tragedy and horror. Dead children are dragged on stage; there will be severed heads mounted on spikes and a forest of bloody spears. Before battle the soldiers perform a grim war dance; the wheels of the famous horse that doomed the Trojans loom in the background. Iphigenia, a solitary, fragile figure, goes to her death as the chorus sings a lament. At the end, Helen, on trial for her ''crimes,'' stands high on a pedestal, in a gown with a 40-foot train. Against the protests of the chorus, the gods exonerate her and she ascends to the heavens.</p>
        <p>Tantalus, the son of Zeus who is punished for stealing the gods' secrets, and for killing his own son and serving him up to them at a feast, will not be seen. But his presence will be felt. He is cursed, as are his descendants in Agamemnon's family, the house of Atreus, and he will be forever reaching for food and water always beyond his grasp.</p>
        <p>Sir Peter's challenge has been to distill and simplify the lengthy text and present a cohesive, driving narrative. Through trial and error he decided, harking back to ancient Greek practice, to use masks as a way to propel the story and to suggest the ambiguity and mystery of the characters. The masks, which in rehearsal were neutral, molded in grayish clay to each actor's face (some would later be made more elaborate), established a mood, a tone, a look. In themselves the masks bear no expression, but they allow emotions to come through. The masks' simplicity and seeming transparency add a certain indefinable beauty to the mise en scene and give the characters a kind of grandeur. The American actress Mia Yoo, who has worked in Ellen Stewart's La Mama company and here plays Iphigenia, said that the masks had forced her ''to find a new way of speaking.''</p>
        <p>''I had to say 'yes' to the mask and make it mine,'' Ms. Yoo said. ''Now the important thing is that we have found our way; it has been rough, but also wonderful.''</p>
        <p>The chorus, on stage for the entire 10 hours, responded to the freedom the masks gave them with stylized body positions and delicate hand movements, resembling at times Noh performers. Each movement is specific and distinct, but together they form stunning patterns. ''The masks have released the chorus physically,'' Sir Peter said. ''So all those patterns you see in rehearsal are not my going around saying do this, do that, but my saying, this is what you are perhaps feeling, what your gut instinct is, and relate it to the mask and see what it does to your body.'' Mr. McKayle, the choreographer, worked with the entire company, instructing them in what he calls the ''movement vocabulary.'' There are no set pieces, he said. ''My purpose is not using movement for itself, but as a means to push the text forward.''</p>
        <p>Sir Peter focuses intensely on language. He pays strict attention to every word, every line, its vowels and consonants, its meter and rhythms, and particularly to what he calls the sanctity of the line. Since ''Tantalus'' is written in verse, the actor must give clarity to the line and make it sound simple and colloquial. ''The whole thing is like learning a dance or a musical number,'' Sir Peter said. ''You learn the notes, you learn the steps, you learn the shapes, and then one has to make it one's own and act it.'' He gives line readings: he tells the actors when to breathe, how to note the end of the line, where the weight is. ''Of course I give line readings,'' he said. ''I always have done so and I always will. When I work with actors, I tell them this is the way I work and it is not negotiable. I do this with all modern plays as well, like Pinter, Tennessee Williams and Beckett. American actors tend to break up the line in an effort to be what they think is 'real.' ''</p>
        <p>The actors in ''Tantalus'' appreciate Sir Peter's approach. ''Peter works like a conductor,'' said the British actor Ann Mitchell, who plays Hecuba. ''He listens to the language as though it were music. At first I found his instructions very difficult, but in the end it is more liberating.  He has a structure, but you must have your own inner motivations within the form he sets.''</p>
        <p>Sir Peter acknowledges that mounting such a large, complicated production is risky. ''Yes, this is dangerous theater,'' he said. ''It could be put in the Guinness book of records as the biggest flop in history. This has been a tremendous gamble. After all, I am 70 and I love working, but I can't have as long a time as I would like, can I? It is a huge investment of time, it's a huge investment of energy, and if it doesn't succeed, it will fail, won't it? I hope it will be successful, but I have no means of knowing except by just getting on with my work. You can't worry about those other things.''</p>
