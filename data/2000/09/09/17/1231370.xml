        <p>After the Buffalo debate Wednesday night, a woman in the audience came up to Tim Russert, the moderator. She said she had liked Rick Lazio until he stalked Hillary Clinton, pestering her to sign his soft-money pledge.</p>
        <p>At that moment, she confided, the Long Island congressman suddenly conjured up the image of her husband, waving a credit card receipt in her face, yelling at her that she had overcharged, his eyes bulging, his veins popping, screaming at her to return everything to the store.</p>
        <p>George Bush senior reminded every woman of her first husband. Steve Forbes reminded every woman of her first husband's accountant. And now Little Ricky reminds every woman of her husband on a peevish tear about expenses, just like those classic scenes from ''I Love Lucy,'' when Big Ricky's eyes would pop and veins would bulge as he waved a bill at Lucy and ordered her to stop spending the household money on hats.</p>
        <p>Hillary got into the New York race because of one badly behaved man. Now she may win it because of another badly behaved man.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also failed to act like a gentleman to the first lady after she was grilled by Mr. Russert about blaming a vast right-wing conspiracy for her husband's vast sexual conspiracy. Snapping and yapping, Mr. Lazio piled on about character and trust and responsibility.</p>
        <p>Now the Democratic candidate could sink comfortably back into the role that got her to Buffalo in the first place: Wronged Woman.</p>
        <p>Hillary can move up only when she is pushed down.</p>
        <p>Because of her air of sanctimony, entitlement and the sense that the rules do not apply to her because she is there to Do Good, people want to see her Put in her Place before they can like her.</p>
        <p>Many New York women who had recoiled at the presumption underlying Hillary's race, that she was owed something because of whom she married and how he treated her, suddenly felt sorry to see her put on the spot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russert may have done Mrs. Clinton a favor by raising the Monica scandal. Mr. Lazio did her the favor of acting sanctimonious, giving her a chance to act sad and vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Her advisers were pleased with her halting language, after Mr. Russert showed the January 1998 ''Today'' tape where, glassy and puffy, she defended her husband. They felt that this gave her a chance to show authenticity and credibility.</p>
        <p>It's remarkable. Hillary can best convey her credibility by talking about her husband's lack of it? She grows stronger only when she seems weaker?</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton blanched when Mr. Russert evoked Monica. But she surely knew she would be asked about her role as field general in the wars against her husband's accusers. Her Senate campaign was born in the crucible of impeachment.</p>
        <p>As David Gergen, a former Clinton White House aide, notes in his new book, the Clinton partnership ''operates like a see-saw. If he goes down in the relationship, she goes up, and vice versa.''</p>
        <p>When New York Democrats first cast Mrs. Clinton as a star, she was a martyr in the midst of the impeachment frenzy, campaigning for Charles Schumer to defeat Clinton-basher Al D'Amato. She held her first Senate campaign strategy session with Harold Ickes the very morning of the Senate vote to acquit her husband.</p>
        <p>Even as Mrs. Clinton talks in the debate about ''the very painful time'' her husband put her through, she relies more on his political advice and fund-raising cachet, adopting more of his machinations. She has set up her own war room and gobbled up soft money. She has been treating donors to state dinners and nights in the Lincoln bedroom.</p>
        <p>Like Al Gore, Hillary Clinton may not be the warmest candidate, but both do their homework. Like the vice president, she's been blessed with an opponent who seems immature, lazy and susceptible to clumsy moments. On Friday, Mr. Lazio misstated the legal voting age as 21 while visiting an elementary school in Riverhead.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton must be be careful to balance her ambition and cold calculation with periodic bouts of victimhood.</p>
        <p>The Whitewater report of Robert Ray, who eagerly stepped into Ken Starr's Torquemada slippers, is due out soon. Who knows? If Hillary's luck holds, it will be the October surprise she needs to cinch the women's vote.</p>
        <p>One more brute slapping her around and she may be home free.</p>
