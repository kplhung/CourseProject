        <p>FLIPPING through late-night talk shows, glancing at advertising billboards or even walking the streets in Midtown Manhattan, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the nation is witnessing an epidemic of buxomness.</p>
        <p>Empirically, women's breasts have been getting bigger for almost a decade (as the news media never tires of gleefully reporting). In 1991, the most frequently purchased bra size in America switched from 34B to 36B, according to NPD, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y., that collects data for the largest bra manufacturers. In the last 12 months, NPD has recorded another jump in the most popular size, this time to 36C.</p>
        <p>Natural growth accounts for only a portion of the visibly more ample curves swelling out of sweaters and stretchy T-shirts these days. Sales of bras that pad and lift and surgical breast implants have also reached record levels. When the Miracle Bra and Wonderbra were introduced separately in 1994, padded and push-up lingerie accounted for less than 3 percent of the United States bra market. In the first five months of this year, however, they accounted for 10 percent of all bra sales at department stores, according to NPD, and 15 percent of sales at Victoria's Secret.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, now that silicone implants are no longer thought to cause auto-immune disease, surgical breast augmentation is more popular than ever. Last year, 191,583 American women chose to have implants, according to the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. That's a 51 percent increase from the previous year.</p>
        <p>Not all societies are enchanted by Rubenesque figures. In Japan, for example, the nape of the neck is far more erotic territory, while in Brazil, where reduction surgery is very popular, an overly ample bosom is seen as low-class, a libido killer, according to ''A History of the Breast,'' by Marilyn Yalom (Ballantine, 1997). But in Western society (and America in particular), large breasts have been in vogue almost continually since Jane Russell defined the pronounced but girdled silhouette in the 1940's.</p>
        <p>Bra company executives chalk up the recent surge in breast size to too many double-cheese Whoppers and super-size fries. A generally aging population seems to be making its mark, since women tend to enlarge with age -- but even bra styles aimed at younger buyers have seen an increase in average size. And even if obesity goes a long way toward explaining the gains, it says nothing about the frenzy for artificial products. Not only are more and more women getting implants for cosmetic reasons, the size of the average implant has grown at least half a size, said Dr. James L. Baker Jr., chairman of the breast committee for the aesthetic plastic surgery association.</p>
        <p>Part of the increase can be traced to the healthy economy, Dr. Baker said. The average breast enlargement operation runs $4,000 to $6,000 -- and that's not including the implants themselves, which cost $1,000 a pair and are guaranteed for life.</p>
        <p>Some students of cleavage think women are simply using new technology to accomplish an end that has been important for generations. In 17th-century France, for example, some court ladies used whale-bone stays under their clothing to help them burst out of the fashionable decolletage. ''We used bobby socks,'' said Helen Gurley Brown, the former editor of Cosmopolitan, explaining how she gave her waif-thin models the full-bosomed look for her magazine's covers in the 1970's. ''Or whatever it took.''</p>
        <p>But changing cultural norms surely play into the decision to augment as well. Studies have shown that most women who opt for surgery say they don't want to look like bombshells, they just ask to look ''normal.'' But what is normal? ''Women say, 'I want a better body image,' '' Dr. Baker said. '' 'I want to buy a bathing suit whose top and bottom are the same size.' ''</p>
        <p>It is hard to make the case that Mother Nature considers such symmetry the baseline, particularly among women over 30 who have borne two children and eat a typical American diet (a major group of implant clients), but there it is. And as average size is defined upwards, in part by more implants, the number of women who need them to meet the new standards for ''normal'' also rises, and so the circle goes.</p>
        <p>Another theory for the recent reshaping of feminine physiques is that the breast in general, and breast tinkering in particular, has become less of a taboo. ''We are at this moment,'' Ms. Yalom said, ''where breasts are in the public eye in a way they never were before.'' Ms. Yalom added that efforts to raise awareness about breast cancer may be partly responsible for women's new willingness to speak openly about their bodies.</p>
        <p>Whatever the catalyst, there is little doubt that bare -- and barely covered -- breasts have become a more common sight everywhere from fashion runways to city sidewalks. When ABC broadcast naked breasts for the first time intentionally during the miniseries ''Roots'' in 1977, it prompted  national soul-searching about sexual mores. In July, when a woman casually flashed her front as the camera panned the live outdoor audience for the ''Today Show,'' the hosts, Katie Couric and Matt Lauer, laughed it off.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, the more relaxed attitude toward breast exposure has not led many women to become more comfortable with the breasts they have, but rather, less embarrassed to pursue the perfect hourglass figures they always desired.</p>
        <p>If there is one comfort for the 34B-crowd, it is that the trend toward larger breasts may be slowing. The female sex icons Demi Moore, Pamela Anderson Lee and Jenny McCarthy, for example, each of whom propelled their careers in part on the size of their artificially enhanced busts, have each opted to have their implants removed recently -- and not for health reasons. Ms. Anderson said she desired to return to her ''natural state,'' the actress's spokesperson told People magazine at the time.</p>
        <p>And as the ''perfect'' Stepford Wife 36C becomes more easily available, ideas about ''normal'' are bound to shift again. ''Whatever your beauty ideal, it is going to be something that only a small number of women can achieve,'' said Valerie Steele, chief curator of the museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. ''Once the technology makes it possible to get closer to that ideal, standards are raised. We will up the ante. It won't be just size, it will be perkiness or the perfect nipple.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 24, 2000, Sunday  An Ideas &amp; Trends article last Sunday about a trend toward increasing size of women's breasts referred incorrectly to the actress Demi Moore. She underwent breast augmentation surgery, but has not had the implants removed.</p>
