        <p>The marquee and the facade of the John Harms Center for the Arts in Englewood has a new look -- and the people who paid for it had their names up in lights for an afternoon.</p>
        <p>The marquee was unveiled on Wednesday starring Citibank, which contributed $100,000 for the state-of-the-art electronic marquee; Bergen County, which contributed $170,000 through the community development block program for renovations to the facade, and Lincoln, the automobile company, the official sponsor of the 2000-2001 season.</p>
        <p>There were also electronic fireworks on the new marquee of the 1,400-seat theater, which first opened in 1926 as the Plaza, a silent movie and vaudeville theater.</p>
        <p>Frank De Micco, president of the John Harms Board of Trustees, said the current renovation ''celebrates the spirit of cooperation between the public, private and not-for-profit sectors.''</p>
