        <p>Was that the Horse of the Year flying through the homestretch at Belmont Park yesterday to wrest the Woodward from Behrens by the length of his head?</p>
        <p>Whatever honors may be waiting, it was Lemon Drop Kid winning his fourth straight stakes and his fifth race in seven starts this year, and pushing his career earnings above $3 million.</p>
        <p>In the last three months, he has outrun some of America's best horses in the Brooklyn Handicap, the Suburban, the Whitney and now the Woodward. And in his final two performances of the year, he will contest the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup and the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic.</p>
        <p>Lemon Drop Kid, a 4-year-old son of Kingmambo owned by Jeanne Vance and trained by Scotty Schulhofer, reached this commanding position by running down all four of his rivals in the Woodward and then matching Behrens in a sizzling duel down the stretch.</p>
        <p>It was a familiar scenario, with a familiar ending: they had dueled it out in the Suburban in July and in the Whitney in August and now, in the sunny cool of September, there they were again.</p>
        <p>''Once he gets his head in front,'' Schulhofer said of Lemon Drop Kid, ''you're going to have a hard time getting by him. This horse does everything he has to in order to win.''</p>
        <p>Schulhofer considered his horse's future and added: ''In my mind, he's the Horse of the Year, and he'll do whatever it takes to get it. If he's got to win two more races, he will.''</p>
        <p>Edgar Prado, who has ridden the Kid in his last five races, said he had no illusions about the 6-year-old Behrens and his jockey, Jerry Bailey.</p>
        <p>''I've got to give credit to Behrens,'' he said. ''He was real tough to get by, and he's an old warrior. My horse just won't let anyone pass, once he gets in front.''</p>
        <p>Schulhofer once more credited two changes for the recent success of Lemon Drop Kid, who has not lost since he added blinkers for the Brooklyn Handicap on June 11. That was a month after Schulhofer switched to Prado as Lemon Drop Kid's rider. The result: four straight trips to the winner's circle.</p>
        <p>''It's been a combination of maturity, blinkers and Edgar Prado,'' Schulhofer, 74, said. ''Once he got his head in front, I knew he would win the photo because I've sat in my seat for a long, long time and have seen so many races. He's a real racehorse, and he knows what it's all about.''</p>
        <p>Lemon Drop Kid ran the mile and an eighth in 1:502/5 , paid $3.40 for a $2 bet to win and earned $300,000. Gander finished three-quarters of a length back in third place, with Skimming fourth and Ecton Park fifth.</p>
        <p>But the race was tightly contested from the start. Gander took the early lead before losing it to the West Coast star Skimming, winner of the Pacific Classic. Then it was Behrens moving into the lead after half a mile, run in 46/1 5  seconds, with Lemon Drop Kid hooking him after three-quarters.</p>
        <p>''I had to move inside down the backstretch,'' Bailey said, recounting his adventure aboard Behrens. ''It was either go up the fence or risk taking back and getting caught in traffic. My horse ran a huge race. He had to fight the whole way and never had a breather. Lemon Drop Kid just got the head bob.''</p>
        <p>While the Woodward ended in a classic match, the $250,000 Ruffian Stakes ended in a runaway for Riboletta, a 5-year-old mare from the West Coast, who won by seven and a half lengths over Gourmet Girl, with Country Hideaway third. Riboletta won her fifth straight and moved into contention for the older filly championship with Beautiful Pleasure and Heritage of Gold.</p>
        <p>The chances that they will meet in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, though, were not certain. Riboletta, who was foaled in Brazil, would have to pay a supplemental fee of $400,000 to compete because her sire, Roi Normand, was not registered for the Breeders' Cup. Her trainer, Eduardo Inda, said he would talk to the owners, Marie and Aaron Jones, before a decision was made.</p>
        <p>Riboletta ran the mile and a sixteenth in a snappy 1:401/5  under Chris McCarron, returned $4.10 for a $2 bet to win and went home with $150,000. She buried Finder's Fee, who finished fifth, and Lu Ravi, the second choice, who ran sixth.</p>
        <p>''She had some questions to answer today, and she did it rather easily,'' McCarron said. ''Every time I ride this mare, I look forward to taking on Beautiful Pleasure and Heritage of Gold.''</p>
        <p>The day's third stakes race, the $200,000 Belmont Breeders' Cup Handicap, was won by the longest shot in the field of six, Forbidden Apple.</p>
        <p>He paid $45 for a $2 bet to win after outrunning the 8-year-old Val's Prince by a length and a quarter, with Altibr third.</p>
