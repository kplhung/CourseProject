        <p>At the three-day Asia-Pacific Economic Summit in Melbourne, Australia, last week, Thomas Russo, vice chairman of Lehman Brothers, learned something about international diplomacy when he confronted a lively group of demonstrators. And the protesters learned not to mess with a New Yorker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russo left the summit a little early on the second day, hoping to avoid the scores of protesters trying to disrupt the gathering. His plan failed when about a dozen people in tattered jeans and camouflage fatigues converged on him, pushing, shoving and yelling insults. ''I started to walk back to my hotel, and they were following me,'' he said in a phone interview.</p>

        <p>Mr. Russo left the summit a little early on the second day, hoping to avoid the scores of protesters trying to disrupt the gathering. His plan failed when about a dozen people in tattered jeans and camouflage fatigues converged on him, pushing, shoving and yelling insults. ''I started to walk back to my hotel, and they were following me,'' he said in a phone interview.</p>
        <p>Sympathetically recalling his college days at Cornell during 1960's antiwar protests, Mr. Russo said he kept his cool and stood his ground. ''I decided the best thing to do was to talk it through, so I just stopped and started chatting with them about global world trade, the right to demonstrate and the right to free speech, for about 20 minutes.''</p>
        <p>The crowd eventually dispersed. ''I would have talked to them for another half an hour, but they sort of got bored, I think. I'm a New Yorker, and I won't be shoved around.''</p>
