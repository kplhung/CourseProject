        <p>AN invasive vine that came to this country more than a century ago is threatening trees lining Westchester's scenic highways.</p>
        <p>Hickories, oaks and sugar maples have begun to disappear beneath a carpet of vines, so imperceptibly that one would be hard put to say when it all began.</p>
        <p>The culprit, commonly known as Asiatic bittersweet, is among the most prevalent of the invasive vines in the Northeast. Along with others like porcelain berry, garlic mustard and Japanese barberry, it has laid waste to the periphery of the county's highways and byways.</p>
        <p>A ride along the Saw Mill River Parkway reveals how aggressive these vines have become. There are long stretches, as in the several miles from Hastings-on-Hudson to Tarrytown or north of the Hawthorne Circle, where the landscape is carpeted, overgrowing low shrubs and blanketing tall trees.</p>
        <p>Ted Kozlowski, the county forester, said that the outcome is inevitable. Once covered, the trees cannot survive: they will slowly die from lack of sunshine. But their death does not kill the invader. It survives, still clinging to its host.</p>
        <p>In the fall and winter, the full extent of the damage can be seen. Vines, as much as six inches thick, encircle the tree trunks in a vise-like grip. Higher up they hang like tangled webs from the uppermost branches.</p>
        <p>Invasive vines attack both deciduous and evergreen trees. Nor is the Saw Mill the only roadway involved. The Hutchinson River Parkway has large expanses of overtaken areas, including the southbound side where it joins the Cross County. Northward into Connecticut and continuing onto the Merritt Parkway, mile-long stretches of the road are affected.</p>
        <p>The Bronx River Parkway and the New York Thruway have not escaped, for along them and secondary roads native trees are disappearing beneath a sea of alien plants.</p>
        <p>The Greenburgh town supervisor, Paul J. Feiner, has been writing to the State Department of Transportation about the problem for more than 10 years.</p>
        <p>''I think these vines are smothering the trees,'' he said. ''I've written to state legislators and county legislators about this, and it's been frustrating. They complain that they don't have the budget resources available.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Feiner believes that one way to attack the problem is to use Workfare recipients to cut away the vines.</p>
        <p>''It seems like the easiest way of doing it,'' he said. ''It's a project that's worthwhile, and it's a good use of Workfare recipients' time.''</p>
        <p>Volunteers and Scout troops might also be used, he said, adding that by ignoring the problem, ''It seems to me that we're being penny-wise and pound-foolish, since obviously all these trees are going to die, and it will be much more costly to replace them.''</p>
        <p>Glenn Dreyer of the Connecticut Arboretum traces the introduction of Asiatic bittersweet back to 1860, when it was imported from eastern Asia for use as an ornamental vine. It was then cultivated by arboretums and botanical gardens here.</p>
        <p>Bittersweet's handsome foliage and colorful berries made it a good choice for garden borders. In fact, homeowners used the branches in decorative flower arrangements, discarding them later as they dried. It didn't take long for its seed to be borne by the wind and migratory birds to the open spaces -- including the roads of Westchester and Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kozlowski described how, characteristically, these vines grow at the edge of forests, where there is ample room to spread and enough sunshine to thrive. The phenomenon, known as the edge effect, is less severe deeper in the forest, with its darker, shadier canopy.</p>
        <p>Road borders, with their sunlit open spaces, are the perfect setting for the vines to proliferate. He said that the County Parks Department, which oversees the parkland along the Bronx River, sends workers out when time permits to cut away the vines.</p>
        <p>In addition, a private nonprofit group, the Bronx River Parkway Reservation Conservancy, has applied to the Westchester Community Foundation for a grant to reclaim the Bronx River's natural habitat.</p>
        <p>Betsy Dolan, a conservancy member, said the organization hopes to work with the county on a pilot project ''to remove invasive vegetation along the Bronx River Reservation, replant desirable native species and preserve the biodiversity that exists.''</p>
        <p>Help is coming from other sources, as well.</p>
        <p>The Native Plant Center at Westchester Community College, an affiliate of the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, sponsors lectures and conferences on how to recognize and avoid invasive species and promotes the planting of native wildflowers in gardens and in the open spaces along roadways. Its next conference, ''Managing Roadsides Naturally,'' will take place on Nov. 3 at Westchester Community College;  (914) 785-7870.</p>
        <p>The county's other parkways, including the Saw Mill, Hutchinson, Sprain, Taconic and Cross County, are maintained by New York State. A spokesman for the Department of Transportation said that clearing the vines would be difficult. When the state has a construction project, it sometimes clears a site, but the state lacks funds for full-scale removal.</p>
        <p>President Clinton last year called on the Interior Department to prevent the spread of invasive species, and the Federal Highway Administration has provided funds to each state for control measures. The National Park Service also recognizes Asiatic bittersweet and porcelain berry as threats and has authorized development of a strategy for their control.</p>
