        <p>Seana Lee Wyman, the daughter of Rosemarie A. Wyman of Brooklyn and Henry E. Wyman of Buffalo, was married in New York yesterday to Frank Nelson Bradley, a son of Noel and William J. Bradley, also of Buffalo. Michael Gage, a former administrative judge of the New York City Family Court, officiated.</p>
        <p>The bride and bridegroom, both 30, work at Ernst &amp; Young, the accounting firm in New York. She is an office manager, and he is a database manager. The bride, who is also an actress, and the bridegroom, also a playwright, worked together in ''Black Mask,'' a homage to 1930's and 40's detective fiction, written by Mr. Bradley and staged in 1998 by the Ontological-Hysteric Theater, Off Off Broadway.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wyman, who is keeping her name, graduated from St. Bonaventure University in Olean, N.Y. Her mother is a supervising court attorney in Manhattan Criminal Court. Her father manages three restaurants in Buffalo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley graduated from the State University at Buffalo. His mother is the office manager of Nelson, Heinz &amp; Shookus, manufacturers' representatives in Buffalo. His father retired as a painter for Buffalo General Hospital. The bridegroom is a grandson of Gen. Creighton W. Abrams, the Army commander in Vietnam from 1968 to 1972 and then the Army's chief of staff.</p>
        <p>The couple met in September 1992, attending classes at SUNY's Buffalo campus. They performed together in Lanford Wilson's ''Hot l Baltimore.'' They were dating others at the time and would occasionally double date.</p>
        <p>''After knowing Frank for eight or nine months, I found that I had more fun talking to him than my date,'' Ms. Wyman said, explaining what changed the status quo.</p>
        <p>They moved to New York City in November 1993, finding day jobs and continuing to perform together.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bradley was ready to propose marriage, he chose when and where he wanted to play the scene, but it did not go as planned. A few days before then, they were having lunch in Midtown Manhattan. He had just picked up the engagement ring. As they sat at the table, he told her a joke. She laughed and smacked his leg playfully. It was then that she felt the box in his pocket.</p>
        <p>''Is that a ring?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>''I had no choice but to tell her in the Le Croissant shop,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''I'm a terrible liar, so I had to tell the truth.''</p>
