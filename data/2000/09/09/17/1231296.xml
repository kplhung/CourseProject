        <p>THE museums could wait.</p>
        <p>When the French artists known as Pierre et Gilles arrived in New York last week, there were two places they wanted to go first: F. A. O. Schwarz and the Gaiety Theater. For these quirky Parisian collaborators, a photographer and a painter whose Pop Art sensibilities lie somewhere between Teletubbies and Tom of Finland, the itinerary made perfect sense. Where better to shop for inspiration than a toy store and an all-male burlesque?</p>
        <p>Creators of one-of-a-kind painted and glazed photographs, exuberantly camp portraits that fetch an average of $25,000 apiece, Pierre et Gilles combine the candy-colored wonder of childhood fantasies and the provocative glamour of more adult ones. Their fantastical work often depicts shopkeepers as saints, singers as sinners and themselves as pistol-packing Elvis impersonators or astronauts lost in a sea of plastic flowers.</p>
        <p>The artists -- both in the vicinity of 50 and neither proffering a surname -- visited Manhattan to help install 56 photo-paintings in their first American retrospective, which opened Thursday at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo. Dan Cameron, the museum's senior curator, chose the works to make the case that Pierre et Gilles, long favorites in the fashion and gay worlds, deserve more exposure and acceptance in the American art world. He jokingly referred to their work as ''gay Norman Rockwell.'' Like that more mainstream painter, Pierre et Gilles have gained their widest audience through magazine and commercial work, producing fashion show invitations for Thierry Mugler, portfolios for the trendy British magazine The Face and album cover art for performers like Erasure, Deee-Lite, and Marc Almond. Reviewing the show in The New York Times, Roberta Smith called it ''a must-see for anyone interested in the intertwining histories of postmodern (especially set-up) photography, fashion photography, commercial illustration, the male nude in art and the emergence of a gay sensibility.''</p>
        <p>In 25 years of living and working together, Pierre et Gilles have imagined Catherine Deneuve as a queen surrounded by clouds, the German punk rocker Nina Hagen as a rubber-clad housewife tied to a kitchen chair and Siouxsie Sioux, the new wave singer, as a glamorous vulture. They manage to find smoldering sex appeal in a snake-headed Medusa and vulnerability in a teary-eyed Communist soldier. Among their best-known portraits are Jean-Paul Gaultier surrounded by daisies, Madonna as a Far Eastern princess, Boy George as Krishna and Aiden Shaw, a porn star, nude except for a cowboy hat, a bandanna and boots, on a pile of stuffed animals.</p>
        <p>Some critics deride Pierre et Gilles as mere purveyors of kitsch. The September issue of Out magazine, for instance, warns that ''taking these guys too seriously is as dangerous as elevating Madonna's music videos to the realm of art and social commentary.'' But the New Museum show ranks Pierre et Gilles with such better-known American artists as Jeff Koons and Cindy Sherman.</p>
        <p>''They're not as famous,'' Mr. Cameron said. ''But I think they will be.''</p>
        <p>It is the kind of imprimatur that has long escaped the two artists in this country. Ensconced for a week's stay in an appealingly dilapidated chartreuse suite at the Chelsea Hotel, Pierre and Gilles -- partners in life, art and cigarettes since they met at party given by the fashion designer Kenzo in 1976 -- were not reflecting on the impact that American exposure could have on their careers and their prices.</p>
        <p>Instead, dressed in T-shirts, jeans and a lifetime of tattoos and speaking through an interpreter as MTV blared in the background, the artists saw the retrospective as an opportunity to reminisce. ''When we look at our work from the last 25 years, it's like a photo album of our lives and our friends,'' Pierre said.</p>
        <p>If that photo album has a theme, Mr. Cameron said, it is ''gay life as an enchanted existence.'' Their vocabulary, he said, reflects their interests and background -- Roman Catholic saints, glamour queens, muscle boys, street urchins, exotic Asian vacations, the sea. ''It's fascinating how they keep unraveling this visual world that they've created,'' Mr. Cameron said.</p>
        <p>Still, he added, ''people have a hard time dealing with the fact that Pierre et Gilles are dead serious about what they're doing.'' Without becoming household names, they have had an impact.</p>
        <p>''They've been absolutely influential across fashion, advertising, photography, publishing and the arts -- really informing late 80's and 90's visual culture,'' said Hugh Merrell, whose company, Merrell Publishers, is issuing a companion volume to the exhibition. ''How many times have you seen airbrushed people surrounded by garlands of flowers?''</p>
        <p>The 1993 music video for the R.E.M. song ''Losing My Religion'' freely borrowed from Pierre et Gilles's saintly portraits. Advertising images for Jean-Paul Gaultier's men's fragrance are so reminiscent of their art that few who know their work realize that they didn't produce the ads. And recently, Pierre et Gilles fans have suggested that certain shots of the recent Jennifer Lopez movie ''The Cell'' call to mind their images.</p>
        <p>''In a way, it's flattery,'' Gilles said.</p>
        <p>''But in a way,'' Pierre added, ''we feel robbed.''</p>
        <p>In an era of computer-generated effects, Pierre and Gilles still spend an average of 12 days on one work. They build all their own sets, furnish the props and light them. Pierre, the photographer, shoots 50 to 80 frames, and then chooses a single print for Gilles to paint. ''It's more interesting for us to work with our hands,'' Pierre said.</p>
        <p>''The image is more alive because it's part of this organic artisanal process,'' Gilles added.</p>
        <p>They make their art on the lower level of a converted factory in which they live in Le Pre-St.-Gervais, a quiet northern suburb of Paris. Their home, on a tiny street, is as intricately designed as their photographs and filled with as much kitsch.</p>
        <p>''You go into a door and you're inside this Pierre et Gilles universe,'' said Mr. Merrell, who visited the artists last year to discuss the book he would publish. ''Their kitchen and dining room is covered with trinkets. It's like Aladdin's cave. They've got nine small screens showing at all times.'' In contrast, their studio is more organized. ''You go down this tiny spiral staircase to where they shoot the photographs, and they've got these immaculately organized boxes of plastic angel wings and skulls stacked up in a corner and all these beautiful labels,'' Mr. Merrell said. ''It's almost like an artwork in itself.''</p>
        <p>Among their influences, Pierre and Gilles count the filmmaker Kenneth Anger, whose ''Scorpio Rising'' married biblical-epic footage with a soundtrack of Little Peggy March's ''I Will Follow Him,'' and James Bidgood, who filmed his homoerotic dream ''Pink Narcissus'' on sets he built in his Midtown apartment. Andy Warhol, not surprisingly, was a big influence, too.</p>
        <p>Over the years the tone of the photographs has become darker and more complex. Initially, Mr. Cameron noted, ''the decision to work together came from the fact that they were young, handsome men in Paris.'' But, as Pierre said, ''we're different people than we were when we were 20.''</p>
        <p>Whether as a reaction to the AIDS crisis or simply to aging, the work has become more somber. This is most evident in their self-portraits. Earlier in their careers they posed as a married couple, with Gilles in a white wedding dress. In more recent images, they've worn black suits and stood surrounded by clear plastic masks, and appeared as faceless motorcyclists surrounded by plastic skulls. The exhibition at the New Museum, the artists said, does not dwell on the brooding side of Pierre et Gilles's work.</p>
        <p>''It's the first time we didn't totally control the show,'' Pierre said. ''We put our confidence in Dan Cameron. It's his vision of us.'' Mr. Cameron, who has become their most vocal supporter in America, said the show is ''pleasure-full.''</p>
        <p>Pierre and Gilles have no real plan for capitalizing on the notoriety the show might bring them in America. ''The most important thing for us is the next image, and that's what moves us on,'' Gilles said. Pierre added, ''We like surprises.'' With that in mind, they changed into metallic suits with matching Adidas sneakers -- gold for Pierre, silver for Gilles -- and made plans to return to F. A. O. Schwarz before leaving town. You never know what new stuffed animals might have hit the shelves in the last few days.</p>
