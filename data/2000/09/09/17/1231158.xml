        <p>LAST weekend I spent about $700, flew six hours, spent three additional hours in airports waiting for late planes and slept on a fold-out sofa, all so I could go grocery shopping for my mother, buy her a stack of novels and take her out to dinner.</p>
        <p>My mother now has the 1.56 gallon jug of laundry detergent that she cannot lift from the supermarket shelf with her arthritic hands. She has a 12-pack of toilet paper and a 4-pack of paper towels too unwieldy to carry from the van to her apartment at an assisted living community in Florida. She has the brand of artificial sweetener she prefers, which requires a trip to a second store she can't get to since she no longer drives.</p>

        <p>LAST weekend I spent about $700, flew six hours, spent three additional hours in airports waiting for late planes and slept on a fold-out sofa, all so I could go grocery shopping for my mother, buy her a stack of novels and take her out to dinner.</p>
        <p>My mother now has the 1.56 gallon jug of laundry detergent that she cannot lift from the supermarket shelf with her arthritic hands. She has a 12-pack of toilet paper and a 4-pack of paper towels too unwieldy to carry from the van to her apartment at an assisted living community in Florida. She has the brand of artificial sweetener she prefers, which requires a trip to a second store she can't get to since she no longer drives.</p>
        <p>The night table in her pleasant apartment is piled with new books: ''Mrs. Dalloway'' by Virginia Woolf and its contemporary takeoff, ''The Hours'' by Michael Cunningham, ''Evening'' by Susan Minot, ''Plainsong'' by Kent Haruf and the latest Sue Miller novel. Best of all, given her love of good food, we ate fresh fish within sight of the Atlantic Ocean at one of her favorite restaurants, impossible except when my brother or I visit. I'd hoped we could squeeze in a movie, something else she misses, but we ran out of time.</p>
        <p>All told, I was there for 28 hours. Sounds stingy, and no doubt her bridge partners are whispering about my failings as a daughter. Or I think they are because of my guilt. But both my mother and I are a little nutty about our privacy, the quarters are close and long visits a strain. How nice it would be, we both agree, if she could move to a comparable residence in Westchester, where I could pop in for a cup of coffee -- and pop right out again.</p>
        <p>She is on the waiting list at two proposed assisted living communities here, and we have been researching others. The few in the county that are already built are expensive or shabby compared to where she is. Others, not cheap but conceivable if my brother and I reach deep to help, are on the drawing board, including one in Hastings-on-Hudson with sweeping river views.</p>
        <p>But this is the county where Nimby rules. Every building project prompts an angry swell of protest and either an outright rejection by the local zoning authorities or interminable delays. The objections vary. Some, detractors say, are out of character with the neighborhood. Others would require precedent-setting zoning variances. What about traffic? And old people who might vote down school budgets?</p>
        <p>I find the objections specious and shortsighted. Do the opponents have elderly parents, and where are they living? Are they old enough themselves to wonder how and where they will spend what my mother calls the not-so-golden years? The only letter to the editor I have ever written was on this subject, and I was excoriated by neighbors, some of whom called to berate me at home on a Saturday morning.</p>
        <p>But I also heard from an elderly widow, stuck in a big house she can barely manage alone, which would fetch $750,000 in this over-heated real estate market. She does not want to leave the village where she has lived for 50 years. The profits from her home would more than pay her expenses at the stalled project on the banks of the Hudson River. There, she could be near her friends, her activities and the familiar landmarks of her life.</p>
        <p>My mother has no such ties here. But she would be close to her children, able to see them frequently without the emotional strain, cost and inconvenience of weekend visits. She does not want to live with either of us, nor do we want her to, harsh as that may sound. But when she falls in the bathroom or is having out-patient cataract surgery, it would be nice to be there. And it would be nice to come home afterward and go to work the next day.</p>
        <p>The widow in my neighborhood and my mother in Florida seem to be in good company in wanting their lives to wind down in a safe place in Westchester County. The assisted living community planned for Sleepy Hollow, for instance, has more than 400 deposits for 225 apartments. In Hastings, 325 people have put their names on a list for 201 units, 217 of them already county residents.</p>
        <p>Let's assume they eventually break ground in Hastings, Sleepy Hollow, Somers, Ardsley, Pelham or any of the other villages considering assisted living communities. Under the best set of circumstances, a new home for my mother would be two years away. She is 85, and so time casts a shadow. The Hudson River sunsets are magical. I'd like her to see them.</p>
