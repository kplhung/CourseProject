        <p>VALUE stocks have been struggling back after nearly two years in the dumps, and Jerome J. Heppelmann, manager of the $116.6 million PBHG Mid-Cap Value fund, thinks he knows why. ''Deep value hasn't worked because there haven't been any positive catalysts to get investors interested in the cheapest of the cheap names,'' Mr. Heppelmann said. ''I look for companies with good near-term business dynamics, like rising earnings, new products or stock buybacks. That gives the buyer good news, which hopefully will attract other buyers.''</p>
        <p>Such catalysts have added value for the fund's shareholders. PBHG Mid-Cap Value returned 26.7 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Sept. 14 versus 10.6 percent for its mid-cap blend peers, according to Morningstar Inc.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heppelmann, 29, started as an analyst for the fund in the fall of 1997 and took over in June 1999. He also runs the Small Cap Value and Focused Value funds as well as the value portion of the Strategic Small Company fund for PBHG, a unit of United Asset Management based in Wayne, Pa.</p>
        <p>Many value managers, he said, have drifted away from the teachings of Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd, the authors of the 1934 value investing bible ''Security Analysis.'' Today, Mr. Heppelmann said, ''people buy companies just on valuation, rather than taking into account the company's potential growth rate and the interest rate environment.''</p>
        <p>In his quest for 100 or so investment prospects among companies with market valuations of $1 billion to $8 billion, he factors in these elements, using a Graham-and-Dodd matrix that prices companies based on their price-to-earnings multiples. The two axes of the matrix are current long-term interest rates and the company's estimated five-year earnings growth rate. When the 30-year Treasury bond pays about 6 percent interest -- as it does now -- the matrix suggests that he pay up to 35.6 times earnings for a company with an estimated five-year growth rate of 20 percent a year.</p>
        <p>Besides valuation, he looks at long-term growth and near-term business dynamics. He measures the three factors several ways, and, he said,  ''if two of the three legs are strong, I'm willing to take a little less on the third leg.''</p>
        <p>Generally, he wants historical and expected revenue growth averaging 6 to 8 percent a year and earnings growth of 10 to 12 percent. ''I don't want earnings growth from cost-cutting,'' he said. ''The mark of a healthy company is top-line revenue growth that drives earnings.''</p>
        <p>He measures near-term business dynamics by looking for expanding margins and revised earnings estimates. He also watches for things like product introductions and insider buying.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heppelmann uses a variety of valuation measures, depending on the industry. For energy companies and casinos, he generally wants an enterprise value -- market capitalization plus debt -- of five or six times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. For cable companies, he figures on at least $4,000 of market capitalization per subscriber. For finance companies, he wants multiples of 10 times cash flow.</p>
        <p>He tends to trade around his positions, buying into weakness and trimming 10 or 20 percent off them as prices rise. In volatile times like these, he conceded, that strategy means a lot of turnover. For the fiscal year ended in March, the rate was 733 percent, partly a result of a much smaller asset base. He expects future turnover to average 150 percent, still high.</p>
        <p>THE fund's biggest holding is Devon Energy, an oil and gas exploration and production company in Oklahoma City. Mr. Heppelmann is bullish on natural gas because of growing domestic energy needs. And a natural-gas shortage is  the near-term business dynamic. ''As we head into winter, we are running 20 percent below the five-year average and last year's storage levels, coming off one of the warmest winters on record,'' he said. Even so, the stock is cheap, trading at less than five times Ebitda, he said, ''because people think it's a cyclical industry and it's peaked.''</p>
        <p>He bought shares in August 1999 at $38.49. They are now at $62, or around 14 times consensus Ebitda estimates of $4.45 a share this year.</p>
        <p>Another favorite is Cablevision, the cable TV company in Bethpage, N.Y., which has holdings that include the New York Knicks and the Wiz, and a controlling interest in Madison Square Garden. Long-term demand for the company's services is clear, Mr. Heppelmann said, because ''more and more services like telephone, data and Internet access are coming across cable TV lines.''</p>
        <p>In the near term, he added, Cablevision is a top player in a consolidating industry and in a region with a highly concentrated population. Not including the value of its entertainment and programming unit, Rainbow Media Holdings, for which a tracking stock is planned, the company sells for less than $3,000 a subscriber -- a bargain, he said.</p>
        <p>He bought shares in April at $63.88, adjusted for splits. They now trade at $68.38, or about 12 times Wall Street's Ebitda estimates of $5.87 a share.</p>
        <p>He also likes Harrah's Entertainment, the casino company that has pioneered a frequent-gambler program intended to promote customer loyalty. The outlook for casinos is strong, he said, because of the economic boom.</p>
        <p>Harrah's stock trades at six times Ebitda, fairly cheap, Mr. Heppelmann said, because investors worried that the market break last spring would grow into a recession. In January, he bought shares at $24.34. They closed on Friday at $27.44, or around 17 times Wall Street's 2000 earnings forecast of $1.65 a share.</p>
