        <p>Horace Greeley, the 19th-century journalist and presidential candidate, has long been Chappaqua's favorite son. The high school and the main street are named for him, and an imposing statue of Greeley clutching a newspaper overlooks his former land holdings.</p>
        <p>Whether he will remain the hamlet's most famous resident is up for debate. But the historical significance of Greeley's home on King Street here cannot be denied, members of the New Castle Historical Society say. After living elsewhere in town, Greeley and his family spent summers in the house from 1864 until 1872, and it is one of the few 19th-century buildings remaining in town.</p>

        <p>The Historical Society bought the house two years ago, after learning it was to be divided into luxury apartments. This week they unveiled the restoration of the stately columned home. It will now be used as the Society's headquarters, a museum, and open for public tours.</p>
