        <p>After aggravating an injury to his left knee on a slide at home plate on Friday night, Mets right fielder Derek Bell was a late scratch from the lineup tonight and does not expect to play again until Monday in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Bell tagged up at third base on Mike Piazza's pop-up to shallow center field and was thrown out by Montreal Expos shortstop Orlando Cabrera. Bell bruised the knee on his slide, but the pain subsided until he woke up this morning.</p>
        <p>His kneecap was swollen, and with six of the Mets' next 12 games against the Braves, Bell felt he needed a rest.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to make sure I'm ready for Monday, because I don't want to mess it up for those games,'' Bell said. ''The six games we've got left with them, I want to be ready for those games.''</p>
        <p>Darryl Hamilton, whose arthritic left big toe will limit him late in games, took Bell's place, giving him starts on consecutive days for the first time this month.</p>
        <p>Bell, who missed five games after banging his knee against a wall while chasing a foul ball on Aug. 29, said he was not too concerned. ''It's just a bruise on the kneecap,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Bell is not the only regular who will use this series to rest for the games against the Braves. Manager Bobby Valentine will give second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo and catcher Piazza one day off this series, with Piazza taking tonight off and Alfonzo resting on Sunday. Third baseman Robin Ventura may also get a break from Olympic Stadium's artificial turf with a day off Sunday.</p>
        <p>Valentine said artificial turf had ''played havoc'' on Alfonzo throughout his career. He has been bothered this year by groin and hip problems that need constant attention.</p>
        <p>''Mentally and physically, you have to work to refresh yourself and keep strong,'' said Alfonzo, who receives treatment two or three days a week. ''I'm doing a little work here and there and sometimes a little rest. We'll see what's going to happen. So far, so good.''</p>
        <p>His health down the stretch will partly determine whether Alfonzo takes part in winter ball.</p>
        <p>Back in the Mix</p>
        <p>After not starting for almost three weeks, shortstop Kurt Abbott has been in the lineup for four of the Mets' last 10 games. Abbott is batting .218 and has been frustrated with his hitting all year, but he closed his stance recently and said it has made a difference.</p>
        <p>Abbott is among the mix of players whose status on a potential playoff roster is uncertain. The Mets have discussed only one kind of alignment -- 14 position players and 11 pitchers -- but they will not begin serious discussions about the roster for about 10 days.</p>
        <p>Only Todd Pratt and Lenny Harris are certain to have bench spots, but Abbott has spent more days with the Mets this year than any of the remaining reserves and said he would be surprised if he were left out. ''Oh, yeah,'' he said. ''But if not, I'll be there for my teammates.''</p>
        <p>None of the other top reserves -- Matt Franco, Darryl Hamilton, Joe McEwing, Timoniel Perez and Bubba Trammell -- have as much experience as a backup second baseman and shortstop as Abbott.</p>
