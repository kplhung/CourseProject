        <p>Personnel men are saying the Giants' Ron Stone is playing as well, if not better, than any guard in football.</p>
        <p>Then why did his offensive-line teammates recently fine him?</p>
        <p>It was actually a fine that Stone did probably not mind paying, as well as an indication of the closeness developing between the linemen, who are playing at an extremely high level. To reaffirm their bond, the linemen have developed a system that fines a colleague who, when interviewed by the news media, speaks of his individual accomplishments instead of those of the line as a whole.</p>
        <p>Stone's supposed crime was that he was asked by the news media about being named one of the team captains. Stone had no choice but to talk about himself. He received no mercy from the players' court and was fined.</p>
        <p>The amount of the fine can be from $2 to $50 or slightly more. Of course, to millionaire players that is the equivalent of change for a cup of coffee.</p>
        <p>It seems silly that a fine system would bring the line closer together, but it does. It simply gets the players talking about being one unit -- not individuals. Stone is one of the least selfish players on the Giants. (Hopefully, his name being mentioned here won't lead to further lightening of his wallet. If it does, he can appeal the fine to the news media court, where any sentence levied by his teammates would be overturned.)</p>
        <p>The Giants linemen aren't the only ones using fines to bring them closer together.</p>
        <p>With the Jets, both the offensive and defensive linemen are part of the fine system. Like the Giants, any Jets lineman who promotes himself over his linemates is nabbed.</p>
        <p>But the Jets have more fun with the fines than the Giants. If a lineman's photo appears in the newspaper? Fine. Show up on a television interview? Busted. Show up on a television interview without a shirt on? Busted even more.</p>
        <p>The entire Jets line was fined once for taking a group photo that hangs on the wall of a local restaurant.</p>
        <p>Again, the point is unity, and both Jets' lines play hard and together. The defensive line last year had only 26 sacks. After two games this season the line already has seven.</p>
        <p>The Jets' offensive line, as it has for years, is playing extremely well. They have allowed only two sacks, which, excluding teams without byes in the first two weeks, is tied for second-lowest with Cleveland. Washington's line is tied for first allowing only one sack.</p>
        <p>The team with which the Redskins are tied?</p>
        <p>Stone's Giants.</p>
        <p>The Cloud Rolls Ahead</p>
        <p>Lost in the splendid season of Giants running back Tiki Barber, one of the true nice guys in football, and the solid showing of the rookie Ron Dayne is the man blocking for them, fullback Greg Comella. Now, like Barber and Dayne, Comella has a nickname.</p>
        <p>The plowing Dayne and the speedy Barber are called Thunder and Lightning. Comella's nickname? The Cloud.</p>
        <p>As in, before there is thunder and lightning there first has to be a cloud.</p>
        <p>Ron Stone gave the nickname to Comella, and actually Comella's blocking style is anything but soft and puffy like a cloud. The 6-foot-1-inch, 248-pound Comella is the next Mike Alstott, the punishing Pro Bowl blocking back with Tampa Bay; only Comella might be quicker.</p>
