        <p>That fall I started commuting, two hours each way, from suburban New Jersey to a Jesuit high school on the Upper East Side. I would emerge every morning at 8 from the PATH station, the old Hudson Terminal, where construction was just beginning on the World Trade Center, and walk down John Street to the Lexington Avenue IRT, which I would ride up to 86th. I wore a coat and tie and carried a briefcase. I was 14 years old.</p>
        <p>It did not take me long, however, to realize that I was a sailor on shore leave in the greatest brawling port of the seven seas, a starveling in a giant pantry, a pond carp released into the River Alph. It started with the subway. First I discovered that if I had homework not yet done in the morning, I could effect a complicated relay via the BMT, whose ancient cars, with their rattan seats and ceiling fans, moved slowly enough that I could write without my pen jumping very much. Then I started getting off at random stations. I'd hang around the great Latin record shop in the Times Square station, the derelict snack bar in the passage from Grand Central to the shuttle, the arcade of dim and grimy shops at Union Square.</p>

        <p>It did not take me long, however, to realize that I was a sailor on shore leave in the greatest brawling port of the seven seas, a starveling in a giant pantry, a pond carp released into the River Alph. It started with the subway. First I discovered that if I had homework not yet done in the morning, I could effect a complicated relay via the BMT, whose ancient cars, with their rattan seats and ceiling fans, moved slowly enough that I could write without my pen jumping very much. Then I started getting off at random stations. I'd hang around the great Latin record shop in the Times Square station, the derelict snack bar in the passage from Grand Central to the shuttle, the arcade of dim and grimy shops at Union Square.</p>
        <p>I started hanging out in the automats, especially the landmark on 57th, as well as the Garment District cafeterias. I'd buy some mimeographed poetry rag at the Gotham Book Mart and repair to a table in a far corner of a cafeteria. I'd find obscure movie theaters, neighborhood houses on their last legs, and always sit in the balcony, where I could smoke. I spent a lot of time staring at the displays outside the 42nd Street movie houses. I loved the edges of things: the remaining industrial and truck and warehouse zones in the middle West Side, where I could wander for hours and then buy myself a cup of coffee in the saddest-looking luncheonette around.</p>
        <p>Eventually I found my way downtown, to the modern world on St. Marks Place, where I was sold little bags of oregano once or twice before I got hep. I'd sidle into incense-and-patchouli boutiques, looking for I don't know what, and always leave disappointed. I searched everywhere for the famous Peace Eye Bookstore, but never found it, because I had no idea there could be any avenues east of First. Mostly I spent hours in the Eighth Street Bookshop and East Side Books and the Phoenix, reading everything, high and low.</p>
        <p>Did I mention school? Well, eventually the authorities figured out I wasn't spending a lot of time there, and kicked me out midway through junior year. I moved to the city a year and a half later, apparently for good.</p>
