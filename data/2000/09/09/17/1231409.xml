        <p>A long and fruitless afternoon for the Rutgers football team ended with its top player, quarterback Mike McMahon, hunkered somberly on the bench. He had pulled the hood of his black jacket over his head, and his valuable right arm was in a sling once again.</p>
        <p>Eighth-ranked Virginia Tech, with four touchdown runs from Lee Suggs and a brief but spectacular performance from Michael Vick, its redshirt sophomore quarterback, humiliated the Scarlet Knights today, 49-0, in the Big East opener for both teams.</p>
        <p>McMahon, who threw three interceptions and completed just 12 of 36 passes, left the game in the third quarter after straining his right shoulder while throwing on the run. It is the same shoulder McMahon had season-ending surgery on after the Virginia Tech game last year.</p>
        <p>An hour after the game, he was still wearing a sling. But he said that he could have returned had Rutgers not been trailing by six touchdowns, and that he was confident he would return for next Saturday's game at Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Coach Terry Shea said, ''We don't sense that there's anything serious.''</p>
        <p>The injury, coupled with the Knights' poor performance against the powerful Hokies (3-0), did more than erase the giddiness over Rutgers's 2-0 start, its best since 1994.</p>
        <p>Down by 21-0 after the first quarter and by 35-0 at the half, Rutgers was not even competitive. It surrendered 348 rushing yards and amassed just 57 on the ground. The punt team had two breakdowns against a ravenous Tech team that has become famous for its special teams.</p>
        <p>Asked how he would deal with the loss, McMahon said, ''Have a short-term memory.''</p>
        <p>''We just have to keep on going,'' the junior fullback Dennis Thomas said. ''We don't have to stop here.''</p>
        <p>After Vick, who finished with 104 yards rushing and 120 yards passing in less than three quarters, reeled off a 45-yard run, he walked over to apologize to Rutgers cornerback Brandon Haw for inadvertently sticking his hand in Haw's face mask. Vick thought Haw was injured. Haw thought Vick had come over to taunt him, and the two argued briefly.</p>
        <p>''They were trying to talk to get to me, and it takes a lot to get to me,'' Vick said.</p>
        <p>Tech boosted its lead to 21-0 on the next play, and any hope Rutgers had of matching strides with the Hokies was gone. The Knights essentially handed Virginia Tech its second touchdown when punter Mike Barr was tackled at the Rutgers 14 after a bad snap by Brian Hohmann, a true freshman.</p>
        <p>''We appreciated who Virginia Tech is, and we knew about their special teams, but we just didn't get it done,'' Shea said.</p>
        <p>The Tech defense, using blitzes that McMahon had not seen on film, baffled the passer, who threw 10 touchdown passes in Rutgers's first two games. The quarterback is asked to get rid of the ball in a hurry in Shea's new offense, but McMahon often threw the ball before his receivers had a chance to face him.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he expected our defense to come out and hit him as hard as we did,'' said Eric Green, a freshman cornerback for Tech. ''I think we shook him up.''</p>
        <p>The Knights did not fluster anyone in a maroon jersey today, least of all Vick, who did a somersault over Rutgers defensive back Shahib White on his 8-yard touchdown run in the second quarter, which made it 28-0.</p>
        <p>''It scared me a little bit,'' Tech Coach Frank Beamer said.</p>
        <p>That was Tech's only scare of the day.</p>
