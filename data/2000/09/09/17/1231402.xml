        <p>Sano Halo, 90, her shock of thick white hair barely poking above the lectern, pulled the microphone down to her level and began reciting the Lord's Prayer in Greek.</p>
        <p>A hush fell over the hall in the Stathakion Center in Astoria, Queens, on Friday evening. The 200 Greek-Americans there stood and bowed their heads. When Mrs. Halo finished, they applauded.</p>
        <p>''My grandfather used to make us stand by the fire and recite it,'' she said later, ''and I have repeated it to myself over and over in all the years since.''</p>
        <p>For 80 years, Mrs. Halo, who was born into one of the villages of Pontic Greeks that were sprinkled along the Black Sea in northern Turkey, had barely spoken her native tongue, having largely lost her first language to a hard life in one of history's ugly chapters of ethnic conflict.</p>
        <p>But the recovery of her childhood language is only one of many satisfactions for Mrs. Halo today. Spry and outspoken, she has become something of a celebrity for many Greeks. Her daughter Thea, after taking Mrs. Halo to Turkey in 1989 to try to find the village of her mother's birth, decided to formally chronicle her mother's life.</p>
        <p>The resulting book, ''Not Even My Name,'' is the story of religious and ethnic conflict between the Turks and Pontic Greeks, of personal strength and the great triumph of mere survival. One of the rare accounts in English, it has become one of the best-selling books in Astoria, home to about 40,000 Pontic Greeks.</p>
        <p>On this night, Thea Halo read from her book, her mother nearby, the audience's silence full of memory and meaning. The trip to Turkey with her mother had convinced her that her mother's life could allow her to tell of ''my land, my people and my stories.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Halo's life story, set against years of fighting with the Turks, mirrors the more recent religious and ethnic conflicts that have torn Bosnia, Rwanda and East Timor. Not only were the Greeks driven from their land, but their culture, language and religious monuments were obliterated, along with many of their villages.</p>
        <p>Nearly a century later, the memories left behind still color the world of the survivors and their children.</p>
        <p>''It is a constant struggle to make people aware of us and the genocide we suffered,'' said Peter Stavrianidis, the head of the Pan American Committee for the Recognition of the Greek Pontian Genocide. ''We ask that it be acknowledged.''</p>
        <p>The Pontic Greeks had lived in Turkey for three millennia. During the Greco-Turkish war from 1919 to 1923, the Turks singled out the Pontic community, along with Armenians and Assyrians, when invading Greek forces tried to seize the coastline.  There were some 700,000 Pontic Greeks when the war began; by its end, an estimated 300,000 had died and the remainder had been forced into exile, according to accounts from the survivors.</p>
        <p>In 1920, at the age of 10, Mrs. Halo was among thousands of Pontic Greeks who were marched across the Anatolian plains to the Syrian border and left to die. Mrs. Halo saw two of her sisters perish on the long march toward southern Turkey.</p>
        <p>Her parents, reduced to begging for food, finally left her with an Arabic-speaking Assyrian family. The mother of that family changed the child's name from Themia to Sano.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Halo's father appeared briefly to tell her that her mother had died. ''It was months before I could cry,'' she said. ''And then my brother came to see to me, to beg for food, and left.'' Mrs. Halo never again heard from her father and brother, the two remaining members of her family.</p>
        <p>She eventually fled from the Assyrian household and was taken in by an Armenian family in Diyarbakir, Turkey. When she was 15, the family accepted $100 in gold from an Assyrian man three times her age, and Mrs. Salo was soon married to him. She arrived with him at Ellis Island in 1925. She and her husband spoke in Arabic, the language of the Assyrians in southern Turkey. She gradually forgot her Greek as she set about raising 10 children.</p>
        <p>The last traces of the Pontic dialect, a mixture of ancient and modern Greek, is swiftly fading in the large Greek communities in Astoria and Toronto, and in the parts of northern Greece where those who were expelled settled.</p>
        <p>''The first generation of Pontic Greeks that left the country were farmers,'' said Anna Stefanidis, who lives in Little Neck, N.Y. ''The educated were all killed. We had to wait for our second generation, who did get an education, to write our story.''</p>
