        <p>Dark Horses and Black Beauties</p>
        <p>Animals, Women, a Passion.</p>
        <p>By Melissa Holbrook Pierson.</p>
        <p>Norton, $22.95.</p>
        <p>Melissa Holbrook Pierson, a lifelong horse lover, is sick of hearing the same old remarks about Catherine the Great. ''Dark Horses, Black Beauties'' is a meditation intended to dispel those tiresome Freudian theories aimed at the universal fascination women seem to have with horses. The book approaches horses in the same way Pierson's previous book, ''The Perfect Vehicle,'' examined motorcycles -- tangentially weaving art, history and sociopolitical commentary to give a broad backdrop to her personal musings. A chapter is devoted to selections from children's equestrian literature, while another quotes everyday horsewomen on the fervor of their devotion. Except for occasional negative generalizations about men (they lack patience, they're afraid of horses), Pierson does not offer much of an explanation for their absence in the barn. Instead, she writes powerfully about the abuses horses suffer at the hands of humans -- the Germans lost 52,000 in the Battle of Stalingrad alone -- and in doing so she exposes the hypocrisy with which man claims to love beast. In excruciating detail, Pierson tells of the terrible deaths horses can experience in slaughterhouses where as many as three-fourths of all racehorses spend their final days. She bluntly uncovers the commonplace cruelty horses experience under abusive trainers and ignorant owners, brutality that often goes unnoticed and unpunished. As she attempts to become an adult equestrian, Pierson struggles to reconcile her desire to relate to the horse as an equal with the unavoidable fact that it does not choose the alliance. Most of this has little to do with girls and horses, which is fine, for Pierson's prose, which can be sentimental and melodramatic at times, requires weightier content.</p>
