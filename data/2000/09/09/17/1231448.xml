        <p>TALK about market watchers. She is at the New York Stock exchange by 7 a.m. every weekday for ''Squawk Box,'' her early report. By 10 a.m., she has already broadcast 15 updates for CNBC as well as affiliates in the United States and Asia. At 2 p.m., she becomes the anchor of ''Street Signs'' from the CNBC Fort Lee, N.J., studio; at 4 p.m., ''Market Wrap.'' And on Fridays, she heads back to the exchange for a look ahead on ''Market Week,'' her newest show (which returns to its 7:30 p.m. slot after CNBC's Olympic coverage had ended).</p>
        <p>A banner at the exchange reads, ''NYSE: The World Puts Its Stock in Us.'' But maybe the world is really putting its stock in Maria Bartiromo - or at least in what she says.</p>
        <p>''It's all about making money,'' said Ms. Bartiromo in an interview on the floor of the exchange a few weeks ago. ''I try to find interesting situations where an investor can have an opportunity, a leg up.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bartiromo, 32, spends her days reporting on market trends, publicly traded companies, the people who head those companies and the people who analyze them. After starting as an intern at CNN in 1988, she was offered a job in business news. She worked her way up from writer to associate producer and then assignment editor.</p>
        <p>''That's where I really started developing a niche for the markets and I started developing a great network of sources,'' said Ms. Bartiromo. ''I remember when I left they said, 'We hate to see you leave because you're bringing your Rolodex.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bartiromo prides herself on her contacts. Guests like Louis Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive at I.B.M., she says, distinguish ''Market Week With Maria Bartiromo'' from other business news shows and prove its success more than the ratings do.</p>
        <p>But the ratings have done their share. In the last quarter, according to CNBC, household viewership for ''Market Week'' was up 60 percent from the same time period in 1999.</p>
        <p>''There's no accident to her success,'' said Bruno Cohen, senior vice president for business news at CNBC. He cited her jounralistic skills, sources, aggressiveness, command and knowledge of the industry, and experience as a producer.</p>
        <p>Nicknamed the Money Honey, Ms. Bartiromo certainly seems to have found her focus. '' 'How do I make money from this situation?' is always the question that I'll ask, with any show or segement,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Two years after starting to report for CNBC in 1993, she became the first journalist to broadcast with a camera on the exchange floor. At first, she was jostled by bustling traders wondering what a reporter was doing on the floor; now she's approached by clerks asking for her autograph and traders requesting information from her last report.</p>
        <p>''Maria's crossed over,'' said Mr. Cohen, ''and become a bit of a pop culture celebrity.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bartiromo says she tries to speak to a variety of groups. ''I feel that at times traditional media has a tendency to feel like the individual out there is not equipped to handle his or her own finances,'' she said. ''I disagree. I feel that the individual out there is savvy; he or she understands this market.''</p>
        <p>''They're not,'' she added, ''throwing dollars at the market not knowing what they're doing.''</p>
