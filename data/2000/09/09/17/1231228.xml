        <p>RED bell peppers, now at their peak season, have a thick flesh and sweet mild taste. But they aren't at their best eaten raw. They should be toasted over wood or charcoal or charred under a broiler until their skins blacken. Then they should be put in a paper or plastic bag where they steam in their own heat for a few minutes. This loosens their skins and makes them juicy and easy to peel.</p>
        <p>Peppers marinated in oil and vinegar brighten a platter of Italian hors d'oeuvres, served perhaps with a chunk of Parmesan and some prosciutto, olives and anchovies. For a party, peppers are good on croutons spread with brandade, a mixture of salt cod and mashed potatoes. And cooked with onions, they are a classic accompaniment to Italian hot and sweet sausage.</p>

        <p>RED bell peppers, now at their peak season, have a thick flesh and sweet mild taste. But they aren't at their best eaten raw. They should be toasted over wood or charcoal or charred under a broiler until their skins blacken. Then they should be put in a paper or plastic bag where they steam in their own heat for a few minutes. This loosens their skins and makes them juicy and easy to peel.</p>
        <p>Peppers marinated in oil and vinegar brighten a platter of Italian hors d'oeuvres, served perhaps with a chunk of Parmesan and some prosciutto, olives and anchovies. For a party, peppers are good on croutons spread with brandade, a mixture of salt cod and mashed potatoes. And cooked with onions, they are a classic accompaniment to Italian hot and sweet sausage.</p>
        <p>If you like anchovies, they can be served on top of a dish of marinated peppers, as in the recipe below. I like to use salted ones, soaking them first.</p>
        <p>Marinated Red Peppers</p>
        <p>Total time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>6 red bell peppers (or 3 red, 3 yellow)</p>
        <p>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil  2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (or more to taste)  1 clove garlic, minced, (green part removed)  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1/2 cup basil leaves, snipped.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat grill or broiler. Cut the peppers into quarters, removing the stems and seeds. Char the skins over coals or under the broiler. Put the peppers in a paper bag and close the opening. Leave them to cool slightly, then peel off the skins.</p>
        <p>2. Arrange the peppers on a plate. Combine the oil, vinegar and garlic. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper. Pour the mixture over the peppers and toss. Sprinkle with basil and serve at room temperature.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Croutons of Red Peppers And Brandade  Total time: overnight soaking plus 30 minutes hands on</p>
        <p>1 pound salt cod, cut into large pieces  4 ripe bell peppers</p>
        <p>1/2 pound potatoes, peeled  2 cloves garlic, minced (green part removed)</p>
        <p>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1/2 cup hot milk  Freshly ground white pepper to taste  1 long baguette, sliced and  toasted in the oven  3 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Soak the cod overnight in cold water to cover, changing the water several times. Drain and rinse thoroughly. Simmer the cod in fresh cold water to cover for 20 minutes. Drain, rinse and remove any pieces of skin and bone.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, preheat grill or broiler. Cut the peppers into quarters, removing the stems and seeds. Char the skins over coals or under the broiler. Put the peppers in a paper bag and close the opening. Leave them to cool slightly, then peel off the skins. Slice the peppers.</p>
        <p>3. Boil the potatoes until tender, drain and mash them in a large bowl with the flaked salt cod. Add the garlic and slowly beat in the olive oil and the milk to make a creamy consistency. Season to taste with white pepper.</p>
        <p>4. Spread the brandade on the croutons and top each one with slices of red pepper. Sprinkle with parsley and serve at room temperature.  Yield: About 30 croutons.</p>
        <p>Sausages With Red Peppers And Onions  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>4 red peppers  2 Spanish onions, sliced</p>
        <p>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil  2 tablespoons fresh oregano  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper  2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (or more to taste)  4 hot Italian sausages  4 sweet Italian sausages.</p>
        <p>1. Cut the peppers into quarters, removing the stems and seeds. In a large skillet, soften onions in the olive oil. Add the peppers and oregano and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, over moderate heat. After 10 minutes, add the vinegar and continue cooking until the peppers are soft (about 30 minutes).</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, put the sausages in a separate skillet in one layer, in an inch of water. Bring to a boil and continue to cook, turning frequently, until the water has evaporated and the sausages are browned on all sides in their own fat (about 15 minutes). Serve on a platter with the peppers or on individual plates.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
