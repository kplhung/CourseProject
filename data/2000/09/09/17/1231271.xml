        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A Sept. 10 news article reported the controversy in Israel over shmita, the sabbatical year when land lies fallow. As you say, in the past a social agreement allowed farmers to continue working the land provided that they ''sold'' it to a non-Jew, but this year, the Orthodox rabbis did not think the arrangement could be justified.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A Sept. 10 news article reported the controversy in Israel over shmita, the sabbatical year when land lies fallow. As you say, in the past a social agreement allowed farmers to continue working the land provided that they ''sold'' it to a non-Jew, but this year, the Orthodox rabbis did not think the arrangement could be justified.</p>
        <p>Yet while explaining the controversy, you overlooked shmita's moral lesson. Shmita allows the poor to take food from the land. It requires the nullification of personal loans. And it calls for the year to be used for study.</p>
        <p>Shmita is about rebalancing inequalities in social status, wealth and education. Perhaps if the rabbis in Israel looked as much to the meaning behind the law as to its intricacies, they could find better direct solutions for allowing the land to lie fallow than resorting to legal fictions.</p>
