        <p>With more than 300 Cezannes, Renoirs and Matisses glowing pricelessly from its gallery walls, the news is stunning to the tightly controlled stream of visitors: the Barnes Foundation is broke.</p>
        <p>''People don't believe it when I say we don't have any more money,'' said Kimberly Camp, executive director of the Barnes, one of the world's premier private art collections, which dazzled museumgoers in a touring exhibit six years ago after decades in seclusion.</p>
        <p>''They ask about the endowment and I have to tell them it's gone,'' Ms. Camp said of the Barnes's depleted $10 million legacy. The fund has proved inadequate for the care and cataloging of a revered collection of more than 2,000 pieces, valued in excess of $6 billion.</p>
        <p>Unprepared for popular success, the 78-year-old collection is still lacking a complete catalog of its works as a staff of newcomers tries to steer it into the world of modern museumgoing. The Barnes's depth continues to surprise specialists with fresh treasures like a series of Rembrandt etchings, unseen for decades and recently found in attic storage. Also largely unplumbed is an archive of 400,000 documents, featuring voluminous correspondence between the collection's founder, Dr. Albert C. Barnes, and artists ranging from Renoir to Georgia O'Keeffe and intellectuals from Bertrand Russell to Albert Einstein.</p>
        <p>Sinking into deficit, Barnes administrators are scrambling for $85 million in new endowments to maintain the collection, along with the Barnes art school and arboretum and Ker-Feal, a 137-acre farm-museum in Chester Hills stocked with 18th-century furniture and art pieces.</p>
        <p>Ms. Camp, a specialist in museum management, describes the financial crisis at the Barnes as a tale of ever more costly operating expenses, past court fights that sapped the endowment, deficit-deepening restrictions on ticket prices and public access, and some unintended straits imposed on posterity by the wishes of Dr. Barnes, who died in 1951.</p>
        <p>A physician and a passionate, idiosyncratic collector, Dr. Barnes personally arranged his trove of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings at his gallery and residence here. It remains the centerpiece of his conviction that art appreciation must be extended to ordinary working-class people as a transformative power in their lives.</p>
        <p>But paradoxically, the Barnes, founded in 1922, evolved through a series of court rulings and legacy interpretations into one of the nation's most restrictive museums. As a result, public access is limited to three days and 1,200 visitors per week, with ticket prices fixed at $5.</p>
        <p>The restrictions were underlined during the recent Republican National Convention in nearby Philadelphia when a special visit of 75 foreign dignitaries was arranged. Watchful neighbors near the Barnes's 13-acre suburban setting complained that the tour would push the number of visitors over the zoning limit of 400, and local authorities sent a warning.</p>
        <p>''In a way, we are being punished for our own success,'' said Anthony C. Ng, the Barnes's new development director. He noted that the discovery of the Barnes by millions of enthusiasts during the international tour of 81 masterworks in the mid-90's compounded fundamental problems rather than solving them.</p>
        <p>The tour raised $17 million. Most of that money was spent to renovate the badly dilapidated gallery and to finally install the climate-control system long needed to protect its treasures. But the Barnes's strictures mandate that none of the money can be used for operating expenses, or even for the newly built parking lot needed for visitors. Ms. Camp estimates that each gallery visitor costs $60 while paying only the $5 set by a court ruling.</p>
        <p>Ms. Camp, who arrived two years ago, has replaced most of the Barnes's 23-member staff, hiring what she describes as its first experienced fund-raising and museum professionals. She has been making regular visits to major foundations and finance sources in pleading for help. There is a $500,000 deficit for the current $3.34 million budget, with an estimated $15 million needed to stay operational for the next five years, she said. Additional millions are needed to assess and stabilize the collection and to archive and develop it as a cash-producing resource.</p>
        <p>Under the Barnes legacy, the paintings cannot be sold off -- something Ms. Camp says would never be considered in any case. She maintains that she is convinced the art-loving public and institutions will respond to the Barnes's fresh resolve.</p>
        <p>''We must show people we can sustain what we're doing,'' she said of a long-range management plan being prepared with financial specialists from Deloitte &amp; Touche. ''We're worth sustaining because we're a national treasure.''</p>
        <p>Visitors who manage to buy a ticket can wander a grand aesthetic bargain, 23 galleries chockablock with Dr. Barnes's eclectically arranged ''ensembles'': an El Greco by a Milton Avery by a Rubens. Bosch by Cezanne by Goya, with Corot, Gauguin and van Gogh waiting nearby in a serendipitous whirl.</p>
        <p>Dr. Barnes believed in shocking people into fresh perceptions by avoiding traditional categorical and chronological juxtapositions. Matisse's bright and sprawling ''Joy of Life'' hangs in a mundane stairwell, and visitors coming upon it wheel in surprise as they ascend, gape and exclaim. Similarly, Dr. Barnes used Pennsylvania Dutch and ancient Egyptian pieces to prod untoward ideas about color or line or space in a room full of Impressionists.</p>
        <p>Beyond the galleries, the Barnes's staff members, while unsure about their next budget projections, enjoy benefits by the wallful in offices vibrant with Daumier and Klee, Titian and Courbet, Sloan and Delacroix.</p>
        <p>Similarly immersed, the Barnes art school of 200 students, who pay a set tuition of $550 a year, is run by a faculty of 35 directly amid the gallery's masterpieces. The collection reflects Dr. Barnes's home-grown aesthetics: for example, treating African art as fine art, not anthropology, so that oval tribal masks complement Modigliani's gazing portraits.</p>
        <p>Born poor and educated in Philadelphia public schools, Dr. Barnes made a fortune after inventing an eye care treatment. A dedicated progressive, he hired John Dewey as the foundation's first education director. He corresponded with Booker T. Washington and opposed racial segregation in pursuit of a democratic approach to the power of art.</p>
        <p>In years past, repeated conflicts between Barnes executives and local authorities cost the foundation more than $5 million of its legacy. One result is a fresh emphasis on cooperation that Ms. Camp sees as a prerequisite for the stability required by donors. The limit of 1,200 visitors a week, she gratefully notes, marks an improvement worked out with local officials over the old limit of 500. But the neighborhood, which is near a busy prep school and college, remains watchful that no flood of tourists begins.</p>
        <p>Ms. Camp agrees that the ''intimate scale'' of the Barnes must be protected. This leads her to conclude that a new endowment worthy of the collection is the needed solution, along with creative uses of the archives and collection to raise money and educate a larger public.</p>
        <p>''Maybe the Barnes's past troubles happened because people loved it so and it became more and more of a closed circle,'' she said. ''The future of the foundation lies in our ability to truly embrace the issue of educating everyday working-class people, our original mission and mandate.''</p>
