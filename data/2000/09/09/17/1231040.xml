        <p>WANT a big theatrical success? Hire yourself a celebrity, preferably a film star. This blunt wisdom has recently brought Kevin Spacey, Cate Blanchett,  Nicole Kidman and others to London,  and, with Jerry Hall replacing Kathleen Turner as the seductive Mrs. Robinson,  is currently ensuring that a none-too-brilliant adaptation of ''The Graduate'' is  packing the Gielgud Theater. And the trend is set to continue this fall.</p>
        <p>Daryl Hannah, a lovelorn mermaid in the  1984 movie ''Splash,'' plays the human siren in George Axelrod's ''Seven Year Itch'' (Queen's, Oct. 9), a role made famous on screen by Marilyn Monroe and her billowing white dress. Then it's the turn of Macaulay Culkin, who opens at the Vaudeville in mid-October in ''Madame Melville,'' a play about a teenager sexually involved with a French teacher played by Irene Jacob, who won Best Actress at Cannes in 1991 for the film ''The Double Life of Veronique.'' Some will suspect this is merely an excuse for the baby-faced actor to kick-start a stalled career; but the author is Richard Nelson, the American dramatist who has had no fewer than eight plays performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company, last year winning an Olivier Award for his ''Goodnight Children Everywhere.'' The omens are better than cynics might think.</p>

And the trend is set to continue this fall.</p>
        <p>Daryl Hannah, a lovelorn mermaid in the  1984 movie ''Splash,'' plays the human siren in George Axelrod's ''Seven Year Itch'' (Queen's, Oct. 9), a role made famous on screen by Marilyn Monroe and her billowing white dress. Then it's the turn of Macaulay Culkin, who opens at the Vaudeville in mid-October in ''Madame Melville,'' a play about a teenager sexually involved with a French teacher played by Irene Jacob, who won Best Actress at Cannes in 1991 for the film ''The Double Life of Veronique.'' Some will suspect this is merely an excuse for the baby-faced actor to kick-start a stalled career; but the author is Richard Nelson, the American dramatist who has had no fewer than eight plays performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company, last year winning an Olivier Award for his ''Goodnight Children Everywhere.'' The omens are better than cynics might think.</p>
        <p>Nor is the Hollywood influx finished. Nobody would be likely to revive O'Neill's intense and grueling ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' in the West End these days with a mere theatrical dame as the morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone; but with Jessica Lange in the role the play is deemed worth the risk and will open at the Lyric on Nov. 21. The presence of Charles Dance as Mary's husband, James, a lightly disguised version of the famous actor who was O'Neill's father, won't harm the production's chances, either.</p>
        <p>But don't worry. Not all major stage performers are in hibernation this fall. Simon Callow is now at the Comedy, offering a lively portrait of the great Victorian in Peter Ackroyd's ''Mystery of Charles Dickens.'' Opening at the same theater on Nov. 15, Michael Gambon is to play the foul old tramp Davies alongside Rupert Graves in a revival of ''The Caretaker'' by Harold Pinter. That superb actress Janet Suzman is the wife whose fidelity is interminably tested by her actor-husband in Molnar's ''Guardsman,'' which is at the Albery from Oct. 11. Felicity Kendal and Frances de la Tour open at the Apollo on Oct. 25 in Noel Coward's gorgeously flippant tale of frivolous women, ''Fallen Angels.'' Derek Jacobi is scheduled for a yet unnamed theater in November in ''God Only Knows'' by Hugh Whitemore, in whose ''Breaking the Code'' he had a huge success in the West End and on Broadway 14 years ago. And before then, on Sept. 21, the Redgrave siblings, Vanessa and Corin, will have opened at the National in Trevor Nunn's revival of Chekhov's ''Cherry Orchard.''</p>
        <p>The National is pretty busy this fall,  and certainly busier than the R.S.C.,  whose openings at the Barbican are a  small-scale ''Tempest'' and ''Duchess of Malfi,'' with the exciting young Aisling O'Sullivan as Webster's doomed heroine. But the National has already launched its new season by presenting Simon Russell Beale's brilliantly fresh Hamlet, and is following up this critical triumph with revivals of ''Romeo and Juliet,'' Ibsen's ''Peer Gynt'' and Michael Frayn's preposterously funny ''Noises Off,'' as well as Pinter's stage version of the film script he constructed from Proust's ''Remembrance of Things Past'' and a play by the unknown Zinnie Harris, which I much admired at this year's Edinburgh Festival. ''Further than the Furthest Thing,'' as it's called, involves islanders based on those who were forced by a volcano to abandon their primitive life on Tristan da Cunha in the 1960's and find sanctuary in England.</p>
        <p>The fall also brings London two major musicals. One is Andrew Lloyd Webber and Ben Elton's ''Beautiful Game'' (Cambridge, Sept. 26), about a football team in religion-riven Ulster, and the other the latest of a series of shows that, for no clear reason, involve French subjects. ''Lautrec,'' a musical about the painter, was an early summer flop at the Shaftesbury. Quasimodo is still flaunting his hump in ''Notre Dame de Paris'' at the Dominion, a show that has impressed the public more than it has the critics. And on Oct. 17 the Shaftesbury plays host to ''Napoleon,'' a musical by Timothy Williams and Andrew Sabiston that rumor says is more likely than either to match the success of ''Les Miserables'' and ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' both of which still illumine the West End.</p>
        <p>There are also intriguing prospects for those venturing beyond mainstream Shaftesbury Avenue and the big national companies. I myself can vouch for the quality of Gary Mitchell's ''Force of Change,'' a highly topical tale of police corruption in Ulster that follows David Hare's new ''My Zinc Bed'' into the Royal Court on Nov. 8. I liked ''Howie the Rookie,'' Mark O'Rowe's play about near-Homeric violence in Dublin that returns to London's outstanding pub theater, the Bush, on Oct. 27. I enjoyed a young actor called Jason Watkins, who reprises a hilarious performance as a harlequin in Goldoni's ''Servant to Two Masters'' at the New Ambassadors on Dec. 14. But I'm also hoping for a bit of stimulus from the work opening, sight unseen, at the three most fashionable of London's small theaters, the Donmar in Covent Garden, the Almeida in Islington and the Royal Court's studio playhouse, the Theater Upstairs.</p>
        <p>Sam Mendes may have established himself as a successful moviemaker with his Oscar-winning ''American Beauty,'' but he's still the artistic director of the Donmar, and marks his return to the theater  staging a play by a completely unknown dramatist. Nick Whitby's ''To the Green Fields Beyond,'' about a tank crew in World War I, opens on Sept. 25, and will be followed on Dec. 11 by a pocket revival of Sondheim's ''Merrily We Go Along.'' Meanwhile Mendes's contemporary Stephen Daldry, whose extraordinary production of ''An Inspector Calls'' by J. B. Priestley is in its fifth year in the West End, directs a new play by Britain's leading female dramatist, Caryl Churchill. Her ''Far Away,'' about strange doings in a weird old mansion, opens in its attic theater on Nov. 30.</p>
        <p>And what follows the darkly comic ''Conversations After a Burial,'' the latest play by Yasmina Reza, author of ''Art,'' into the ever enterprising Almeida on Oct. 31? The answer is ''Light,'' an adaptation of a novel about a man who leaves his village in search of love, and returns bearing death in the form of a plague-ridden rabbit, by the Swedish writer Torgny Lindgren. What gives this play special interest is that the company responsible is Theatre de Complicite, despite its name the most highly regarded of English troupes specializing in physical theater. Would most British critics rather see this odd-sounding piece than yet another Hollywood star in yet another revival? You bet.</p>
