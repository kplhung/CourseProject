        <p>From Herzl to Rabin</p>
        <p>The Changing Image of Zionism.</p>
        <p>By Amnon Rubinstein.</p>
        <p>283 pp. New York:</p>

        <p>As a source of surprise and paradox, Zionism seems to stand without parallel in world history. Its very name evokes an end-of-days messianism, a culmination to centuries of exile and struggle, yet its key promulgators were antireligious hotheads who cut themselves off emotionally and historically from their forebears. They co-opted the ''chosenness'' of religious Jews -- the idea that God had selected his people to serve as a ''light unto nations'' by giving them the Torah -- and recast it, saying that they would serve as a model of an enlightened, collectivist society. This would be accomplished by replacing the pale, black-coated ghetto dweller with a sinewy, earthy, half-naked soldier-farmer. In other words, the new Jew would achieve his uniqueness by aping the gentile. The historian Arthur Hertzberg pointed out more than 40 years ago in his classic essay ''The Zionist Idea'' that all other 19th-century nationalisms based their efforts on an already existing national land or language, usually both. Zionism had neither. As David Ben-Gurion said, while most revolts are uprisings against a system, Zionism was really a revolt against destiny.</p>
        <p>The surprises only get more interesting once Israel is founded. While Zion is a biblical term for Jerusalem, the holy city was not the movement's focus. The true expression of Zionism was thought to lie in the creation of Tel Aviv, the first Hebrew city, with its Bauhaus functionalism and historical blank slate. In fact, when the war broke out in 1967 and it became clear that Israel could seize Jordanian-held East Jerusalem with its Western Wall and other holy sites, many in the government, including the two religious ministers, spoke out firmly against doing so. Yet today, Jerusalem is unambiguously at the heart of Zionism, particularly of religious Zionism.</p>
        <p>Amnon Rubinstein, a moderate member of the Israeli Parliament for the past quarter-century, a former government minister and dean of the Tel Aviv University Law School, and one of the more intelligent and decent public figures in Israel, has written a book that reflects on some of these surprises. ''From Herzl to Rabin'' has vigor and depth. But it is a manifestation of Rubinstein's double role. While the book is, in part, a sober account of the movement in which he has played a vital role, it is also a Savonarola-like screed against those he fears are hijacking Zionism -- the religious right and the post-Zionist left. Both his scholarship and his argument are interesting. But they are not of equal quality.</p>
        <p>Rubinstein is at his best when examining the fascinating byways of Zionist history. The book's most original and thoughtful chapter, ''No More Sabras,'' focuses on the role the sabra, a native-born Israeli, has played in Zionist consciousness. The term is taken from the local cactus fruit, a prickly pear that, if you manage to cut through the thorns, has a sweet heart. Drawing on poems, novels and essays of the day, Rubinstein captures the ''Lord of the Flies'' atmosphere of the early settlers, their rejection of parents and family, their eternal adolescence.</p>
        <p>Rubinstein is also eloquent on the gap between the secular values of Zionism and the religious symbols it has ultimately embraced. He illustrates how that tension has made many an Israeli ambivalent: ''His head reaches to the heights of secular modernity: the attraction of the sciences and the arts, the pleasures and discontents of 20th-century civilization. Yet his legs straddle a land subject to an ancient dispute. His heart is torn between the obvious need to defend his home, private as well as national, and the dark suspicion that this battle is acquiring, in spite of himself, the character of a religious war. Had he been fanatically religious . . . it would all have been much simpler. But his universal-secular upbringing makes it far from simple.''</p>
        <p>Rubinstein has been a key advocate for human rights in Israel and is leading an effort to write the country's first constitution. He therefore has nothing but disdain for those who claim that their access to a higher law -- the religious right -- gives them the right to violate the laws of the state. His attack on the extremist rabbis who, he says, created the conditions that led to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish law student is not particularly original, but it is powerful and well argued.</p>
        <p>Where Rubinstein does become original -- but, in my view, less persuasive -- is in the link he sees between these religious extremists and post-Zionist leftists teaching at Israeli universities. He goes so far as to call this a ''partnership'' and argues that both seek to libel and destroy the humane Zionism to which he has devoted his life. He spends nearly 100 pages caricaturing the new historians of Israel as a bunch of postmodernists who believe there are no objective facts, who want to destroy the Jewish nature of Israel and who care not a whit for truth or evidence that runs counter to their political agenda.</p>
        <p>This is a pity. There are certainly leftist Israeli academics who fit this description. But others have clearly added to our understanding of the nation's history through the careful use of previously classified documents. Rubinstein says the critics ''make the mistake of considering Zionism a monolithic movement lacking any internal heterogeneity.'' But that is precisely the mistake he makes in attacking the revisionist scholars. This makes for a strange disconnect. Rubinstein not only accepts but thoughtfully promotes the idea that the Zionists and their cause were noble but flawed. But when others point to the dark side -- when, for example, they unearth what appear to have been rough Zionist tactics inside the displaced person camps of postwar Europe -- he is offended. He wants to frame the discussion in his own terms. When he quotes a new historian on Zionist shortcomings, he quickly dismisses the evidence by saying that national movements usually involve cruelty and tunnel vision. This is true. But revisionist historians usually overstate their case. Why be forgiving of one and harsh with the second?</p>
        <p>Rubinstein ends this book with the hope that the ''authentic'' Zionism of Israel's founders can be recaptured. It is, he says, the only movement that can properly lead the Jewish people and attain peace with its neighbors. Perhaps. But his own unwillingness to discern shadings among those with whom he disagrees suggests that ''authentic'' Zionism lies in the eye of the beholder.</p>
