        <p>To the Editor: Many thanks to Catharine Reynolds for her article about new Sicilian hotels among the island's glorious historic locales (''Modern Comfort, Ancient Sites,'' Sept. 3).</p>
        <p>I share Ms. Reynolds's fondness for Sicily, from where my maternal grandparents emigrated. And I'm glad that she and her husband were so fortunate with their hotels.</p>
        <p>But for gay couples, getting a hotel room in Sicily can be awkward, as my partner and I found out during a visit this summer.</p>
        <p>We were sightseeing with two Sicilian friends, also a gay couple. We made reservations at a seaside hotel in Selinunte, on the west coast. But when we checked in, the clerk did not want to honor our request for two matrimoniali, i.e., rooms with double beds. He insisted that we take rooms with single beds. One Sicilian friend argued with the clerk, attracting the attention of the boss. ''Let them have what they want,'' he said sternly.</p>
        <p>We enjoyed our brief stay, and  we'd like to think that the next gay or lesbian couple to stop there will be able to check into a matrimoniale with no questions asked.</p>
