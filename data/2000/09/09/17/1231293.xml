        <p>Sam Ulano hates wooden drumsticks. They are too light, he says, too easy on the arms. He always plays with metal ones. Except there he was at his 80th birthday party at the Red Blazer Hideaway on West 37th Street last month, rapping away on ''South Rampart Street Parade'' with a pair of wooden sticks.</p>
        <p>''You look beautiful!'' he called out to the bald men dancing with not-so-natural redheads. He himself was an impish Burl Ives in a red bow tie. ''It's so nice to be 80 and still see people having fun. Me, too.''</p>

        <p>Sam Ulano hates wooden drumsticks. They are too light, he says, too easy on the arms. He always plays with metal ones. Except there he was at his 80th birthday party at the Red Blazer Hideaway on West 37th Street last month, rapping away on ''South Rampart Street Parade'' with a pair of wooden sticks.</p>
        <p>''You look beautiful!'' he called out to the bald men dancing with not-so-natural redheads. He himself was an impish Burl Ives in a red bow tie. ''It's so nice to be 80 and still see people having fun. Me, too.''</p>
        <p>And the stick switch? Someone suggested that for one night he use sticks stamped with the names of his heroes, Gene Krupa and Glenn Miller. He went along because he has learned a few things in his 65 years in New York's jazziest clubs and teaching thousands of drummers.</p>
        <p>Be tough on yourself, for example, but be easy on others. Follow a strict personal regimen -- from marathon practice sessions to arm muscle workouts -- but always charm the crowd. Mr. Ulano bubbles with exuberance on stage because he is maniacal about excellence when alone. It is the reason he excels, and drummers love him for it.</p>
        <p>John Sarracco, a Rainbow Room regular and a longtime student, said, ''You want to call him an uncle, a guru, a mentor, and you do, because he can still just knock you out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ulano was born in Manhattan, one of 10 children and the son of a Russian-Jewish shirt presser who changed Ulanovsky to Ulano. Young Sam discovered the drums at 13.</p>
        <p>''I was fascinated about how two hands, two feet and the brain do this thing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>By 14, he was charging friends 50 cents for lessons; by 15, he was playing at Catskills resorts and later backing up Bob Hope and the U.S.O. while in the Army.</p>
        <p>He could have found fame on the big band circuit. He chose the clubs of New York instead. People here still remember when he played with Tony Parenti, the clarinetist, at the Metropole Cafe in the 1960's and later at the Gaslight Club. He has been at the Red Blazer since 1983.</p>
        <p>He has also recorded a few albums, but he prefers teaching. He has written more than 2,000 instructional books. For decades, drummers like Russ Moy and Marvin Smith of Jay Leno's ''Tonight'' show band have pounded on the rubber board in his West 53rd Street studio.</p>
        <p>Jim Chapin, a fellow drum instructor,  said Mr. Ulano's legacy was his students. ''He played a big part in bringing drummers together,'' Mr. Chapin said. ''He loves that brotherhood.''</p>
        <p>After teaching every day, Mr. Ulano practices for four hours before heading to the Red Blazer to play favorites like ''What a Wonderful World.'' Tourists always request it, and he always obliges. ''I love what I do, and that's the main thing,'' he said. ''I still feel like I'm 30 years younger, like I'm just starting out and learning to play this instrument that I love.''</p>
