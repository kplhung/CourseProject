        <p>The country's most popular singer nowadays is also the first victim of censorship by the country's military rulers since they grabbed power last Dec. 25. It happened a few weeks ago after Tiken Jah Fakoly, a young reggae star who sings in French and in the languages of this troubled West African nation, came out with a recording called ''Chameleon.''</p>
        <p>''Like a chameleon that changes colors,'' he wrote on the cover of the recording, not bothering to name names since they were clear to all, ''our chameleon does not keep his word.''</p>
        <p>Things are getting worse and worse over here in Ivory Coast, he sings in his lament for the country, titled ''Le Pays Va Mal'' (''Things Are Going Bad''). The army is divided, society is divided, students are divided, Christians and Muslims are divided, even market women are divided.</p>
        <p>''Keep your honor,'' he tells the chameleon. ''Sweep the house clean and return to your village, just as you promised. You promised us. Remember.''</p>
        <p>The chameleon is no less a person than Gen. Robert Guei, the junta leader. After leading a putsch that toppled an unpopular government in December, he said all the right things expected of modern-day coup leaders: he was not really interested in power but had simply come to ''sweep the house clean.''</p>
        <p>''Once we know that the house is clean and politicians can dance without slipping,'' the general had said, ''we will withdraw, after holding transparent elections.''</p>
        <p>Over the months, though, the general has appeared less and less interested in giving up power. He has maneuvered to eliminate his political and military rivals. One of the major political parties pointedly rejected him as its candidate for a presidential election scheduled for Oct. 22, but the general has declared himself a candidate ''of the people'' and ''above the parties.''</p>
        <p>After billboards went up across Abidjan last month, with portraits of the general announcing his candidacy, some were torn down almost immediately. Others were spray-painted in big black letters, ''Demissionne,'' or ''Step down.'' And six corporals who had been assigned to protect the general were arrested on suspicion of plotting a takeover.</p>
        <p>Still, it was perhaps the appearance of ''Chameleon'' that signaled the clearest change in public opinion against the military government. In a country where national television reports news with Soviet-style efficiency and the newspapers are tied to politicians, many Ivoirians look to musicians to express truths unavailable elsewhere. Reggae especially reflects and shapes public opinion.</p>
        <p>The initially popular coup led several of the country's reggae stars to write songs supporting General Guei. One of the best-known singers, Serge Kassy, thanked the soldiers ''who liberated the country'' in ''Liberty.'' In ''My General,'' he thanked General Guei for coming to ''sweep the Ivoirian house clean.'' The general had entered the history books, he said.</p>
        <p>But then the general's popularity began to slide. The toppled president, Henri Konan Bedie, had picked clean the country's coffers, the general  said. But soon his own wife was spotted on shopping trips to Paris.</p>
        <p>The uncertain political situation and the postponement of the election, originally scheduled for this month, have paralyzed the country. The start of the school year has been pushed back to October, and it may be delayed even further. Meanwhile, the children of the Ivoirian elite, returning to schools abroad, have the flights to Europe booked solid through mid-September.</p>
        <p>In the region, the troubles of Ivory Coast, once the most stable country in West Africa, have been greeted with a noticeable lack of sympathy. For decades, Ivoirians regarded  their neighbors, most of whom had lived through several wars and coups, with smugness. Nowadays, Nigerians, their longtime rivals in West Africa, compare General Guei, with a mixture of exaggeration and glee, to Gen. Sani Abacha, whose misrule nearly destroyed Nigeria.</p>
        <p>Whether or not the Ivoirian general could actually become another General Abacha, Ivoirians clearly do not want to take the chance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fakoly stunned many Ivoirians by the bluntness of his message to General Guei. Not only was he ordering the chameleon to return to his village, he also did so using the familiar ''tu.'' In French Africa, where politicians are fawned over with an endless string of honorifics, the absence of the ''vous'' in the song could not have been more insulting.</p>
        <p>''It shocked me,'' said Patrick Pinasseaux, 24, a singer who was listening to music at the house of a friend and fellow musician, Hamed Fall, 26, in the working-class neighborhood of Treichville. ''When I first heard his music, it dumbfounded me. I know we live in a democracy. . . .''</p>
        <p>''Pseudodemocracy,'' Mr. Fall chimed in.</p>
        <p>''Yes, thank you. Pseudodemocracy. But I was shocked at what he was telling Guei. Ordering him to step down from power. You just don't say these things to an African head of state.''</p>
        <p>But, said Mr. Fall, a reggae singer with dreadlocks whose room is covered with posters of Bob Marley, ''it was necessary.'' adding, ''You can't just make music to make people dance.''</p>
        <p>The young men said they believed Ivoirian music had become radicalized under military rule. They look up to singers like Tiken Jah Fakoly, not the more famous and older reggae singer, Alpha Blondy. They, like many younger musicians, said Mr. Blondy had compromised himself by supporting Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who led Ivory Coast with a paternalistic but firm grip for three decades until he died in 1993 and was succeeded by Mr. Bedie.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Houphouet-Boigny and the French, who kept a close watch on their former colony, Ivoirians have generally tended to yield before their leaders. They still look up to the French in a way that, say, Nigerians never would to the British.</p>
        <p>''We have been politically asleep for too long,'' Mr. Fall said. ''Look at our universities -- they don't even have political science departments.''</p>
        <p>''Singers like Fela were making radical music in the 70's,'' he said, referring to Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, a  Nigerian musician who, until his death three years ago, was a fierce critic of his country's military rulers. ''We are only starting now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pinasseaux added: ''That's why they censored Tiken Jah. You don't censor just anybody or just anything.''</p>
        <p>Although the military yanked ''Chameleon'' from the airwaves, it has not cracked down on sales, betting perhaps that few Ivoirians could afford the $5 to buy it. Still, the album was the top seller in record stores in Treichville. At Oke Records, Salaou Nadjim, 17, said from behind the counter that he was selling about 30 cassettes or CD's of ''Chameleon'' a day.</p>
        <p>If the authorities try to prevent record stores from selling it, Mr. Nadjim said, it will find its way to the city's black markets.</p>
        <p>''He told the truth in it,'' Mr. Nadjim said. ''No one can stop it now.''</p>
