        <p>BY this weekend, Eric Schlakman will have $4,500 in the bank. The last paycheck from his six-day-a-week lifeguard job will have cleared, and the stage will be set for something he says he has anticipated for virtually all of his 16 years: buying his own car.</p>
        <p>This landmark was preceded by an even larger life event: getting a driver's license.</p>
        <p>Looking back, Eric said his days on earth might well be divided into before and after. Like countless teenagers with sudden access to a car, Eric is now tasting that first intoxicating sip of transportation freedom, that heady feeling that comes from no longer having to ask, ''Mom, can you give me a ride?''</p>
        <p>''I've been waiting my whole life for this,'' he said in his home in a residential neighborhood a few blocks west of bustling Central Avenue. ''Finally, I'm in control. If I want to go somewhere to see a friend, I pick up the keys and I go.'' He paused. ''Of course, I still have to ask mom if I can drive her car, but when I buy my own . . . ''</p>
        <p>The statement about waiting a lifetime is no exaggeration. Eric's mother, Michelle Beil, confirmed it. An ebullient nurse, she recalled giving him a toy vehicle as soon as he was old enough to know what it was. ''We even gave him a fake gas pump and an expired credit card so he could pretend he was filling up the tank.''</p>
        <p>Eric, now a lanky 5 foot 10 with a perfect toothpaste-ad smile and a penchant for running, concurred: ''That's right. My very favorite toy was this bright orange plastic car that I'd sit in and pedal with my feet.''</p>
        <p>Next came video games in which he honed his future driving skills. At Nathan's and other places, Eric played ''Cruisin' U.S.A.'' and ''California Rush,'' navigating virtual highways, ''driving at insane speeds, racing against your friends.''</p>
        <p>That, of course, is not how Eric drives on real highways. Taking a visitor for a Friday night cruise down Underhill Road and along Central Avenue, checking the parking lots of favorite Edgemont High School hangouts like the Candlelight Inn and Pizza &amp; Brew, he was a blend of confident and cautious. The only touch of whimsy was the pair of red fuzzy dice hanging from the rear-view mirror in the family's 1993 Honda Civic.</p>
        <p>Eric has great respect for the road, for the power of the vehicles on it and the rules intended to keep everyone safe. He pored over the learner's permit manual. On his 16th birthday, he took the written test at the state's Department of Motor Vehicles office. Told on the spot that he had passed, he celebrated with his mother by driving on back-country roads the rest of the day.</p>
        <p>Then came the two months between learner's permit and license. With a learner's permit, one is allowed to drive only with a licensed adult in the car. Ms. Beil took him out to practice every day. (Now, on days that she gives Eric the car, she rides her bicycle six miles to work at White Plains Hospital.) They practiced straight-ahead driving, U-turns and parallel parking.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to find places to get good at parallel parking between two cars in our neighborhood, because we know all of our neighbors and didn't want to risk fender benders,'' she said. Eric's father, David Schlakman, a senior vice president of a car dealership, also put in driving time, as did his stepfather, Marshall Beil, a lawyer.</p>
        <p>The most important thing was getting the feel of the car, Eric said. ''You're used to being a passenger, sitting on the right side, and now here you are on the driver's side, and you have to realize how wide this car is, and where it is in relationship to the other cars on the road.''</p>
        <p>And then there were the real-life situations that no manual could cover. ''One time I was on Post Road, and some lady darted out from nowhere,'' he said. ''I slammed on my brakes, she slammed on hers, and we just stared at each other for a minute.''</p>
        <p>His mother added, ''He realized then, it's different from a video game.''</p>
        <p>Eric also polished his skills with an instructor from a private school, Center for Driving in White Plains. It was this genial man -- ''he was so nice and encouraging'' -- who took him to the main event, the road test, administered by the Department of Motor Vehicles, which seemed at the time to be the most crucial seven minutes of his life.</p>
        <p>''When it was over, this woman inspector just looked at me and said, 'Passed,' '' Eric recalled. ''She showed no emotion. It was nothing to her, but it was everything to me.''</p>
        <p>Now Eric has his junior license. That means he can drive alone from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. and with a licensed driver 18 or older from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. When he turns 17 next February, he will get his senior license because this summer he took a six-week official New York State driver's education course. (Without the course, senior licenses are given at 18.)</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, he drives to school, to track and cross country practice and just about everywhere else. ''I can just go to a friend's house, and it's great,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He does not take for granted such simple pleasures as getting behind the wheel and driving off to get a slice of pizza. He also indulges in that time-honored pastime of suburban teenagers: picking up a few friends, cruising around, going nowhere in particular, just savoring one another's company and the open road.</p>
        <p>The driver's education course also entitled him to a 10 percent reduction in car insurance. That savings, plus the $4,500 he has amassed from his summer job, will soon get him, if not the new car of his dreams, a used one that will be perfectly acceptable.</p>
        <p>''I'd like a 2002 Dodge Viper GTS-R, bright red, convertible top, black leather interior,'' he said. ''That's not what I'll be getting. And you know what? Whatever I get will be fine. I love driving so much, love the feeling of motion. Remember, I'm a runner. I like movement. So just about any car that I choose, any car that is all mine, I will love. I swear, I will wax it with a diaper every day.''</p>
