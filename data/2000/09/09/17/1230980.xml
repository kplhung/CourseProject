        <p>I lived that first year in a cheap, unheated loft on Water Street, literally in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, with my friends Francis O'Shea and Darrah Cloud. This was 20 years ago, before the South Street Seaport, when Water Street looked like the set of a movie about postwar Berlin, when at most hours its only visible inhabitants were a tribe of scrappy but prosperous cats.</p>
        <p>Our landlord -- the same one who neglected to mention that our loft was unheated -- habitually assured new tenants that the six-story building had a freight elevator that opened onto each loft. He didn't tell them it had not worked in at least 50 years. Newcomers would arrive with vans full of furniture, ring for the elevator and wait. And wait.</p>

        <p>I lived that first year in a cheap, unheated loft on Water Street, literally in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, with my friends Francis O'Shea and Darrah Cloud. This was 20 years ago, before the South Street Seaport, when Water Street looked like the set of a movie about postwar Berlin, when at most hours its only visible inhabitants were a tribe of scrappy but prosperous cats.</p>
        <p>Our landlord -- the same one who neglected to mention that our loft was unheated -- habitually assured new tenants that the six-story building had a freight elevator that opened onto each loft. He didn't tell them it had not worked in at least 50 years. Newcomers would arrive with vans full of furniture, ring for the elevator and wait. And wait.</p>
        <p>Confronted, the landlord would rig up a pulley system, open the trapdoors that closed the shaft on each floor and help them haul their possessions up by means of an ancient hydraulic winch. So every now and then we moved Francis's bed out of the elevator shaft, opened the trapdoors, made cocktails and watched as someone's earthly goods gradually ascended past our floor to an upper one.</p>
        <p>Here came a great green dowager of a sofa, then a pine table, then a queen-size bed with cherubs carved on its headboard. On moving days, with all six trapdoors open, you could look some 90 feet straight up and see, all along the brick walls, pictures hanging in gilt frames, candles in niches, hat racks with hats on them, exactly like the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland.</p>
        <p>Above us lived an ordinary-looking middle-aged man and woman. They were robust, vaguely suburban; he prone to chinos and polo shirts, she to sheath dresses and nylons. They were neither friendly nor hostile; their only visible mystery was the fact that they lived in this neighborhood at all, stepping complacently each morning over the weedy sidewalks and broken cobbles in their sensible shoes. Every night, however, they stomped around on the floorboards over our heads as if they were marching to an especially rousing Sousa selection, and often, at least three or four times a night, they dropped the Object.</p>
        <p>The Object fell, always, with a thud decisive enough to rattle the light bulb over our kitchen table. It seemed to be about the size and weight of an ottoman, with a solid/soft quality, like a medicine ball. It fell every night, at unpredictable intervals. It became impossible not to wait for it. It was equally impossible to ask them about it -- they were as self-contained as manatees, and about that approachable. We decided that they had a curse on them: they were permitted to live obscurely, incognito, unpunished for their crimes, but whenever they were at home one or the other of them had, at all times, to be carrying the Object, which we came to imagine as a giant potato, tufted here and there with hair, teeth and eyes. Naturally they dropped it every now and then.</p>
        <p>Approximately once a month a huge bin, the size of six conventional Dumpsters, appeared in front of the warehouse down the block, overflowing with shoes. They were variously women's, men's and children's shoes; some were new and some used. Passers-by made arrangements of them. During the days of the shoes we'd come home to find 10 or more pairs of spike heels, or cowboy boots, or wingtips, sometimes in a straight line down the middle of the street, sometimes in more elaborate formations. Once we found a phantom choir of little girls' patent-leather party shoes in prim lines on the stairs to our building.</p>
        <p>After two or three days the shoes were gone again, though we never saw anyone take them away. The arranged pairs were always left behind, along with miscellaneous spillage: a brand-new platform shoe might lie on its side in a puddle; a well-worn hiking boot might still stand, stalwart as an old dog, on the shattered sidewalk.</p>
