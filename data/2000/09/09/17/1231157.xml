        <p>IN the spring of 1997, when Sue Morrow Flanagan first saw what is now the Kitchawan Institute here, it did not look promising. A storm had strewn tree limbs all over the property. The main building had been abandoned six years earlier by its previous owner, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Field Research Station. Inside, there were so many leaks that water could be heard trickling all over the building.</p>
        <p>''It was a disaster,'' Ms. Flanagan said.</p>
        <p>To some people, the notion of spending a large chunk of the family fortune to buy the property and transform it into a site for promoting sustainable development and international human rights might seem risky, to say the least.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Flanagan did more than that: she insisted that the Kitchawan Institute be a ''green building,'' demonstrating some of the environmental technologies she hopes to foster in her education programs.</p>
        <p>The result will be unveiled to the public on Sept. 27, when the institute officially opens its doors. Built on 14.7 acres and surrounded by 200 acres of woodland owned by Westchester County, the institute is a nonprofit organization that will be the host for educational workshops and business meetings.</p>
        <p>In a sense, the institute's unusual mission reflects Ms. Flanagan's own quirky life history. She spent several early years in Nepal, where her first husband was posted as a diplomat, working as a photojournalist for The Financial Times of London and other newspapers. She became interested in human rights, documenting atrocities in the region, and, according to her resume, played a role in the struggle to free the kidnapped daughter of a British tourist from Sardinian bandits.</p>
        <p>She moved to Westchester in 1982, where she worked in public relations and from 1989 to 1993 published Water Ways: New York's Waterfront News, a monthly newspaper covering development, the environment and issues affecting rivers, lakes and canals throughout the state.</p>
        <p>Ms. Flanagan, 48, has been married and divorced twice and has two adult children. She lives in Ossining about a mile from the institute.</p>
        <p>After buying the building and grounds for $600,000 in 1997, Ms. Flanagan spent another $2 million renovating it. Most of the money was contributed by her grandmother, Emma Weston, 97, who lives in a nursing home in Croton-on-Hudson. Ms. Weston gave to a number of causes during her life, and her fortune is now largely spent.</p>
        <p>''She didn't want to leave money that people would fight about,'' said Ms. Flanagan, who contributed $250,000 of her own.''</p>
        <p>The institute also received two grants totaling $10,000 from the county and the state.</p>
        <p>Ms. Flanagan, who will serve as the institute's president and preside over a staff of eight, sometimes talks like a New Age guru. ''Because of the beauty of the place, the magic of the place, I believe it will make communication breakthroughs happen,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But she is very serious about making the institute support itself by renting the building for corporate meetings and retreats. The space includes two main rooms, which seat 50 and 75 people, and a leafy interior courtyard, which can be covered by a tent.</p>
        <p>The institute's main competition will come from area hotels, said Clare Pennino, the director of business and applied programs in the continuing education division at Purchase College. But she said there was a growing demand for off-site meetings and training sessions and Kitchawan's unusual setting was a strong advantage.</p>
        <p>''When many executives go to meetings,'' she said, ''one of the things they attempt to look at or will appreciate is an environment that is different from their normal routine.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Flanagan's environmental enthusiasm is apparent to anyone entering the columned green porch of the institute, which leads into a large room where a cedar trunk appears to prop up the ceiling. Above it, on a ceiling painted sky blue, tiny fiber-optic lights glint like stars. Glass doors give a view of the trees and gardens outside, and painted ivy on the walls extends from actual ivy on the outdoor walls beyond, in a trompe l'oeil effect.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to bring the outside inside,'' Ms. Flanagan said of the building's airy architecture, which was designed jointly by Peter Helmes of Katonah and Lucio DiLeo of Studio RAI in Pleasantville.</p>
        <p>But what really makes the institute a ''green building'' is its geothermal heating system, which uses the earth's constant temperature beneath the surface to help heat the building in winter and cool it in summer. The institute received a $40,000 grant from the State Energy Research and Development Authority to help develop the project.</p>
        <p>Ms. Flanagan relishes taking visitors to the basement to see the two pumps that send water up from a 300-foot well and around the house, constantly monitoring the temperature. ''I call them Sylvester and Tweety Bird,'' she said, smiling admiringly at the deep blue pumps. The system does not supply all the building's heating needs, so there is a standard oil furnace as well -- ''the dinosaur,'' as Ms. Flanagan puts it.</p>
        <p>The geothermal system will save Kitchawan $7,000 a year in energy expenses, and by reducing its reliance on fuel oil, cuts its emissions of pollutants, according to the authority's consultants, Steven Winter Associates.</p>
        <p>''We're not just pulling people together to talk about green technology, we want to be a demo site as well,'' Ms. Flanagan said.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, she hopes the site will draw environmental engineers and inspire them to innovate.</p>
        <p>''I want the top minds in green buildings here,'' she said. ''When we've got them all together, we'll have taken a whole bundle of fuses, and they'll walk out and you'll see a whole bunch of fireworks, and who knows what will come of it.''</p>
        <p>In addition to environmental programs, the institute will present speakers on international human rights law from several universities and the Westchester Commission on Human Rights. The institute will also grant fellowships to lawyers for summer study at the International Human Rights Law program at Oxford University.</p>
        <p>''People used to say 'think globally, act locally,' but that's no longer possible,'' she said. ''It's irrelevant to focus entirely on the metropolitan community without understanding that we are an international community, and what we can do about it.''</p>
