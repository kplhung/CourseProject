        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his review of ''The Presidential Difference,'' by Fred I. Greenstein (Aug. 27), Phil Gailey maintains that the four modern presidents who ''would make most people's lists of the 20th century's dominant chief executives'' were ''except for Truman, all great communicators.'' Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan each contributed techniques and tropes that influenced their successors' rhetorical styles and strategies. But Gailey's failure to acknowledge Truman's equally significant contributions to presidential rhetoric betrays an unfamiliarity with both Truman and the characteristics of good communication.</p>
        <p>Many recent presidents have tried to mimic the demotic style of Roosevelt's fireside chats, the wit and flair of Kennedy's news conferences and the anecdotal power of Reagan's speeches. But Truman's straight talk has had an equal if not larger influence on presidents' communication strategies. Al Gore's pledge in his speech at the Democratic National Convention ''to stand up'' for working families by waging the ''day-by-day fight'' against the ''powerful forces and powerful interests that stand'' in their way could have been delivered by Truman. And Gore's postconvention rise in the polls suggests that Trumanesque clarity and empathy can still galvanize the public.</p>
