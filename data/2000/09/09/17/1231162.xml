        <p>THE last time someone resigned from the Putnam County Legislature more than a decade ago, it was after angry civic debate concerning issues of welfare and housing.</p>
        <p>But this month, when Anthony Listrom, who represented about 10,000 constituents in the woodsy town of Kent, resigned there were no political discussions, no ethical debates, no governmental quandaries. Instead, there was mystery.</p>
        <p>Over Labor Day weekend, Mr. Listrom just disappeared. One day, he was a lawyer and accountant with offices in New York City and Carmel. The next day his offices were closed and his phones were disconnected or unanswered, and his political colleagues were wondering if they would see him again.</p>
        <p>The one-line letter in which he resigned from the seat he had been elected to in November, cited ''personal reasons.'' It was faxed in, the Putnam County Clerk said, on Sept. 5 from somewhere south of the Mason-Dixon line.</p>
        <p>''Look, I'm going through the final stages of a divorce,'' said Mr. Listrom, who returned a reporter's cell phone message, saying he was somewhere in Florida but declining to be more specific. ''Basically, I got an offer down here that is too good to pass up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Listrom, a Democrat, said he was proud of his record in office.</p>
        <p>''I accomplished more in nine months than many of those people have accomplished in years on the Legislature,'' Mr. Listrom, 41, said. ''I got elected fair and square, and I served the people. I initiated what I promised. In the course of life there comes a time when you have to make a decision.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone agrees. In fact, Mr. Listrom's harshest critics come from within his own party.</p>
        <p>''There were signs of his lack of enthusiasm even during his campaign,'' said Sam Oliverio Jr., the sole remaining Democrat on the Putnam County Legislature. ''He was a half-hour late for his own swearing-in ceremony. He had a pathetic attendance record. He had pathetic input.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Oliverio continued: ''The Democratic Party struggles in Putnam County. Our credibility is on the line constantly here. And now this.''</p>
        <p>On Sept. 6, Terry N. Intrary, a Republican, who lost to Mr. Listrom by 22 votes, was sworn in to take Mr. Listrom's place in the Legislature for the remainder of the year. In November, there will be an election to fill the seat.</p>
        <p>Stephen Rosario, the chairman of the Putnam Democratic Party, said he was interviewing people to run for the seat.</p>
        <p>But even Mr. Oliverio says that Mr. Intrary, a retired Carmel police detective and salesman for an asphalt distributor, is a good man for the job and far more dedicated than Mr. Listrom ever was.</p>
        <p>Tony Hay, a Republican legislator from the town of Southeast who encountered his own public relations debacle when he called for the Immigration and Naturalization Service to investigate Hispanic immigrants in the village of Brewster, said the rumors have been circulating nonstop about Mr. Listrom's departure.</p>
        <p>People who saw him carting boxes out of his office in Carmel over the Labor Day weekend were told: ''He was closing his office in Carmel and moving his office to New York City,''  Mr. Hay said. ''People said, 'O.K., that's not unusual.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hay continued: ''Of course, what he didn't tell them was that then he would keep going south on I-95. There's nothing wrong with resigning. It's just the way he resigned that bothers me. To leave under the cloak of darkness. It's just weird.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Listrom, of course, doesn't see it that way. If there is any lesson to be garnered from his tenure in the Legislature, it is a lesson of hope, he said.</p>
        <p>''Democrats now know it's possible that a Democrat can be elected in Putnam County,'' he said. ''They have to remember that.''</p>
