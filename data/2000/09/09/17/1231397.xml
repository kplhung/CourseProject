        <p>Dave Rich, an old-fashioned dairy farmer who long ago perfected his thousand-yard stare, has a simple explanation for why he hasn't sold his 100-plus green acres to developers.</p>
        <p>''Too stupid,'' he said. Silence. Off in the distance, crows cawed. A minivan motored by. The sun dipped. After a while in Mr. Rich's company, visitors come to understand that this is his way of sharing a laugh.</p>
        <p>''They offer a million for this piece or that piece,'' he added, eventually. ''One guy said, 'I'll give you $4 million for the road frontage,' '' about five acres along Route 67. ''I go, 'Nope, not for sale.' They say, 'But . . . ' and I say 'Nope!' and that's it.</p>
        <p>''I'm not really polite,'' said Mr. Rich, 44, rubbing his bearded chin with the back of a mallet-size fist. ''But I don't swear at them.''</p>
        <p>Pardon his visceral reaction. But dairy farms like Mr. Rich's, which he runs with his brother, Don, are fading into Connecticut's past faster than ever. Since 1990, 126 dairy farms have disappeared from the state's landscape -- there are none left in Fairfield County, according to state records. About 230 remain scattered throughout the rest of the state.</p>
        <p>In an age of enduring economic prosperity and high-tech solutions to just about everything, making milk has only grown more difficult, and the difference between turning a profit and turning the farm into a subdivision, any dairy farmer will tell you, remains perilously small.</p>
        <p>''We've lost 10 farms this year,'' said Gabe Moquin, an assistant director in the State Department of Agriculture. ''We'll probably lose a dozen or so by the end of the year.''</p>
        <p>To keep Rich Farm, with its 1950's wood barn and twin grain silos, from becoming an eponym for yet another condominium complex, the Rich brothers did what a number of their colleagues around the state have done in recent years. They built a sturdy shack opposite the cow barn, put up a sign along Route 67, cleared room for a parking lot and started making ice cream, in 25 flavors.</p>
        <p>''Don't want to give up,'' said Mr. Rich, in a relatively long-winded explanation, on one recent Sunday evening as he milked Blue Collar Cow, one of about 70 eccentrically named Holsteins lined up in stalls like tractor trailers parked for unloading. The more he is asked about not giving up, the more bitterly he recalls how other farmers in southwestern Connecticut have been persuaded to sell land to developers.</p>
        <p>''They work clearing land, building stone fences, ruin their bodies in the process,'' Mr. Rich said. Then hard times hit, the developers come in and buy the farmer's land and sell it for a huge profit, he said, pouring several gallons of Blue Collar's milk into a vat, to be pumped it into a stainless steel cooler for pasteurizing.</p>
        <p>''Overnight they make twice what the guy did in 60 years,'' he said. ''That's what really drives me crazy. Why do those guys have to make so much money for doing so little?''</p>
        <p>Since Rich Farm's Ice Cream Shop opened in 1994, it has turned into a financial success. Mr. Rich declines -- cordially, sort of -- to discuss money. But on just about every rain-free Sunday between March and November, the creamery turns the farm into a well-populated Norman Rockwell portrait. On a recent well-chilled Sunday evening, 45 grown-ups stood, goose-pimpled, in a 20-minute line for ice cream, overlooking the Naugatuck River valley.</p>
        <p>Standing in line, one need not tune out noise from bleeping pagers and cell phones because there isn't any, only the caw of crows, polite adult conversation and the warble of children's voices. And an occasional moo from the barn.</p>
        <p>''It's like old-time America, just where you grew up,'' said Guido Dadamo, 72, of Phoenix, sitting down in a plastic lawn chair near the barn to feast on two big scoops of chocolate.</p>
        <p>Many loyal customers, like Lucretia Sveda from nearby Middlebury, come back to the farm every summer, and familiar faces routinely find one another during the wait in line. ''This is the best place for ice cream,'' said Ms. Sveda, 47. ''It's just the whole atmosphere, with the corn and the cows and the smell,'' she said, glancing at the barn, from which the dueling aromas of sweet cream and manure wafted.</p>
        <p>To many people in this rolling, picturesque patch of Connecticut, the Rich Farm has become a tourist destination. ''Whenever we have guests come in from out of town, we say, 'We've got to go to the farm,' '' said Beverly Cervino of Southbury.</p>
        <p>There is no shortage of premium-grade ice cream in this state. The University of Connecticut's Dairy Bar, on its campus in Storrs, is perhaps the best known. But the private sector is growing; in the last decade, a half-dozen dairy farms around Connecticut, including Rich Farm, have started creameries as a way of staving off developers.</p>
        <p>Dave Rich said he hopes to pass the farm onto his three children, the same way his grandfather Tom Ajello, an Italian immigrant, passed the land to Mr. Rich's father, who worked it until Mr. Rich and his brother were old enough to take over.</p>
        <p>To keep the crowds coming, the Riches even engage some basic marketing formulas, churning out new flavors like Cookie Monster and, in a nod to autumn, pumpkin. Dave Rich, of course, prefers eating ''chocolate, basic chocolate,'' which he does three times a day.</p>
        <p>Whatever it takes to keep the developers away.</p>
        <p>''They probably think we're just a couple of dumb hillbillies,'' Mr. Rich said, his hands firmly on the teats of a cow named Whitey, whose swishing tail repeatedly whopped Mr. Rich in the face. ''But they just put their head down and leave.''</p>
