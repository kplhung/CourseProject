        <p>THE recent arrival of two new Australian carriers, Impulse Airlines and Virgin Blue, ending the longtime duopoly of Ansett and Qantas, has dramatically cut domestic air fares in the country. On a one-way flight between Sydney and Melbourne, the regular economy fare is $184, at 1.74 Australian dollars to the United States dollar; in recent weeks, seats on that route have been selling for as little as $38.</p>
        <p>Besides government deregulation, the Sydney Olympic Games can also take a little credit for reducing the cost of flights.

        <p>THE recent arrival of two new Australian carriers, Impulse Airlines and Virgin Blue, ending the longtime duopoly of Ansett and Qantas, has dramatically cut domestic air fares in the country. On a one-way flight between Sydney and Melbourne, the regular economy fare is $184, at 1.74 Australian dollars to the United States dollar; in recent weeks, seats on that route have been selling for as little as $38.</p>
        <p>Besides government deregulation, the Sydney Olympic Games can also take a little credit for reducing the cost of flights. All four carriers advertised specials because business travel, the airlines' staple, was expected to dry up during the Games, which opened Friday and will close Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>Until Oct. 8, the one-way fare between Sydney and Brisbane (as well as Sydney and Melbourne) can be as low as $38; and between Melbourne and Brisbane, $57, with no advance purchase and no round trip required. Those are far lower than the round-trip 14-day advance purchase fares of $173 between Sydney and Melbourne or $282 between Melbourne and Brisbane, both of which require a Saturday-night stay. Compared with regular economy fares, they are cheaper still.</p>
        <p>Impulse Airlines has flown regional routes in New South Wales for seven years, but entered the major interstate routes only in June. Virgin Blue, a subsidiary of the Virgin Company, created by Richard Branson, started flights Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>While the two newcomers have a range of fare schedules akin to those of Qantas and Ansett (all the lines use the same airports), they are also promoting some exceptional deals. Impulse set off the price war last month when it introduced its $38 one-way fare between Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
        <p>Impulse has 11 daily round-trip flights between Sydney and Melbourne (fares range from $38 to $88 one way) and eight daily round-trip flights between Sydney and Brisbane ($38 to $94.50) on its five Boeing 717-200 jets. Tickets can be booked on www.impulseairlines.com.au, by telephone within Australia (13-1381) and through Flight Center's 500 retail travel agent outlets in Australia (13-1600).</p>
        <p>While tickets on the company's regular fares are fully changeable and even transferable, the deeply discounted fares of $38 are nonrefundable and nonchangeable and can only be booked on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Virgin Blue is starting with four daily round-trip Boeing 737 flights between Sydney and Brisbane (increasing to seven by Oct. 1), with at least half the seats available at the launch price of $57 one way. Its Melbourne-Brisbane route has three daily flights in each direction at $80 one way. Tickets at www.virginblue.com.au, by phone within Australia (13-6789) or with travel agents.</p>
        <p>Qantas and Ansett both responded rapidly to the deep discounting by Impulse and Virgin Blue, matching the $38 fares between Sydney and Melbourne. Qantas and Ansett also took Impulse's Sydney-Brisbane fare and extended it until Oct. 28. Qantas tickets can be bought at www.qantas.com.au, at (800) 227-4500 or from travel agents. Ansett tickets are available at www.ansett.com.au, by phone within Australia (13-1300) or through travel agents.</p>
