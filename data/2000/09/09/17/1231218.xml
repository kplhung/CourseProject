        <p>New Jersey parents are less likely to leave their young children at home alone after school than working parents in the 11 other states studied by the Urban Institute, according to a survey released last week. Nationally, 21 percent of children aged 6 to 12 whose parents work are left alone after school,the institute said, compared with 14 percent in New Jersey. ''We think more children in New Jersey are left with relatives, partially because of the density of the population and partially because of the large immigrant population that keeps close family ties,'' said Jeannette Russo, fiscal policy analyst for the Association for Children of New Jersey.</p>
