        <p>On New Year's Day in 1967, seeking an advantage against Georgia Tech at the Orange Bowl in Miami, the University of Florida football team started quaffing a flavored drink filled with replacement salts that had been developed by researchers at the university.</p>
        <p>As the game wore on, the Georgia Tech players wore down, but not the young men from Florida. The team ended up winning, 27-12, in a second-half flurry of great plays. When the Georgia Tech coach was asked what turned the tide, he replied: ''We didn't have Gatorade. That was the difference.''</p>
        <p>By the next season, Gatorade was practically being inhaled along sidelines across America. That was the 1960's, and while  players still slosh down Gatorade, coaches continue to look for every advantage.</p>
        <p>When the Philadelphia Eagles surprisingly routed the Dallas Cowboys in their National Football League season opener a couple of weeks ago, a new salt-replacement fluid -- pickle juice -- made its N.F.L. debut. Half of the Eagles downed two-ounce cups of the brine before and during the game, which was played in 109-degree heat in Dallas.</p>
        <p>Relishing all of this was the nation's largest pickle maker, Vlasic International, with headquarters in this Camden County township. Last week, Vlasic paid a low five-figure sum to become the official pickle supplier for the Eagles.</p>
        <p>''Let's face it,'' said Vlasic's vice president of marketing, Steve Young. ''if the Eagles won eating applesauce, no one would have cared. People thought the pickle juice was quirky and funny. They got excited about it very easily. And from our standpoint, anything that creates excitement about pickles is good for us.''</p>
        <p>Before last week's game against the Giants, Vlasic sponsored a pickle-juice dunk tank at Fan Fest, the pregame festival for fans outside Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. People threw a football at a target and, if they hit it, a man dressed in a Giants uniform dropped into a tank full of pickle juice. Nearby, Vlasic had a pickle-tasting booth. And before the game on the field, the Vlasic stork flew in on a guide wire from the top of the stadium. Pickle Power T-shirts were selling briskly for $15. And a fan in the stands won a year's supply of Vlasic pickles.</p>
        <p>Despite the pickle juice, or because of it, the New York Giants -- with Gatorade on their sideline -- beat the Eagles, 33-18.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Vlasic is not to be denied. The company's Wisconsin brand, Milwaukee Pickles, has long been a sponsor of the Green Bay Packers. And fortuitously for Vlasic, the Eagles will be playing the Packers in Green Bay today.</p>
        <p>''We're calling it the Pickle Bowl,'' said Mr. Young. ''We are winners either way.''</p>
        <p>And Vlasic plans to do more than just pregame events now that the pickle juice is flowing. There are plans for a national marketing campaign, and Mr. Young and his team are looking into Pickle Heads, much like the Swisscheese hats that have become popular in Green Bay. And although commercial pickle juice drinks are probably not on the Vlasic agenda, Mr. Young will not be above promoting all kinds of uses for pickles and their brine.</p>
        <p>''Drinking pickle juice was certainly a behavior we knew about,'' said Mr. Young. ''There is no scientific data that it is an elixir, but people drink it to feel healthy, even when they aren't playing football. And we get letters all the time from gardeners. It seems particularly good to pour pickle juice on azaleas and petunias.''</p>
        <p>The Gatorade people are keeping silent. But the Professional Athletic Trainers Society has pooh-poohed pickle juice, saying that it is not necessarily better than anything else in replacing sodium during athletics.</p>
        <p>''Let's put it this way,'' said the Vlasic spokesman, ''Gatorade is a sponsor of the National Football League, which employs members of the trainers organization, who decided to put out such an announcement. We think that's an overreaction. We're selling pickles. And fun.''</p>
