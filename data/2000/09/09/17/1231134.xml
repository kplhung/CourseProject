        <p>HE doesn't go around talking about it, but Bill Van Orman went swing for swing with Tiger Woods at the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach in June.</p>
        <p>Van Orman, an assistant pro at Sleepy Hollow Country Club, qualified for the Open the week before and flew out in time for Monday's practice round. Afterward, he wound up on the practice tee hitting balls alongside Woods.</p>
        <p>Woods, his back to Van Orman, was hitting short irons and working his way up to longer clubs, so Van Orman winked at his father and began doing the same. As he continued to match Woods's incredible distance, iron after iron, murmurs began to ripple through Woods's large gallery.</p>
        <p>There was a net about 250 yards out, and none of the golfers -- not Fred Couples nor Davis Love III, both practicing nearby -- could clear it. Woods began hitting 3-woods over it, and so did Van Orman. The gallery started to hoot, and Woods and his teacher, Butch Harmon, both turned to see who the big-hitting newcomer was.</p>
        <p>''Tiger was in a long-drive contest he didn't even know about,'' Van Orman recalled in the dilapidated teaching shack at Sleepy Hollow Country Club here. It was hot and muggy and there were mosquitoes. He wasn't at Pebble Beach anymore. He was back at work and it looked like rain. His last student had canceled, and he was telling stories to kill time before running an evening golf clinic for members' children.</p>
        <p>No one else at the Open really challenged Woods, who went on to win by a record 15 strokes. Van Orman played a bit jittery over the first two rounds and missed qualifying for the two final rounds by two strokes.</p>
        <p>Of course, just to play in the U.S. Open is a dream come true for most club pros, and matching shots with Tiger Woods just plain fantasy.</p>
        <p>But Van Orman was disappointed with his play, and as far as fantasy, he has no time for that. He has been trying to become a P.G.A. touring pro since graduating from college 15 years ago, and he is running out of time.</p>
        <p>Bill Van Orman has never had a job outside golf. He was an all-American in high school and played in the 1985 U.S. Open at 21. (Tiger was in fourth grade.) A young P.G.A. Tour hopeful after graduation, Van Orman got his father to back him financially, but that ended after three unprofitable years.</p>
        <p>Van Orman has repeatedly turned down comfortable positions as head pro at prominent Westchester clubs to keep up a rigorous playing schedule. He has played in the P.G.A. Tour's annual qualifying school 10 times and supports his quest by working at the club teeing up practice balls for club members and fixing slices, tallying scores at member-guest outings and cheerfully playing with strangers at pro-ams.</p>
        <p>''If you would've told me getting out of college that I'd be still knocking around at this age and still not have my Tour card, I would've told you you're crazy,'' he said. ''But I feel like I'm getting better, and as long as I'm improving, I'm going to keep at it. It's always been my dream, and I feel I'm inching toward it.''</p>
        <p>But he is 36 now, and in an era when golf is dominated by younger players, that is considered twilight time on the Tour.</p>
        <p>Van Orman and his wife, Kim, have spent every winter apart since their 1994 marriage, since he plays a rigorous tournament schedule from November to March in Florida and abroad. She does not see him all that much up here, either. She is 31, too young to be a golf widow, especially since they both want children.</p>
        <p>''I want him to take this as far as he can,'' she said. ''I don't want to trap him or slow him down. We're playing it by ear. He's doing well, and that's what's important right now.''</p>
        <p>Van Orman admits he is on the back nine of his Tour quest, with only a few seasons left to see his dream either plunk into the cup or spin out. The result will determine whether he spends his Sunday afternoons being watched on television in the Sleepy Hollow clubhouse or straightening swings down at the practice area.</p>
        <p>Many local professionals call him the most talented player in the metropolitan area, one who could make the Tour if only he played up to his potential.</p>
        <p>Now he is finally starting to do that, winning four tournaments in the last two years and $50,000 in prize money since November. Last winter, his most lucrative, he finished second on the money list in the competitive P.G.A. Tournament Series and first in scoring, with a 71.15 average.</p>
        <p>''Billy probably has as much potential as any great player in the world,'' said Darrell Kestner, the head pro at Deepdale Golf Club on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Kestner is helping Van Orman streamline his swing by reducing the ''moving parts, funny angles and unnecessary motion.'' Now it is more level with less of a dip in the backswing.</p>
        <p>''His ability and capability is unlimited; tapping that is a different story,'' Kestner said. ''He has all the game you can imagine a great golfer having, but there's a lot more to the game than that.''</p>
        <p>''His length is so dramatic,'' he said. ''He has the club speed of Tiger Woods. He's the longest ball striker in the metropolitan area, but the longer you hit the straighter you have to be.''</p>
        <p>''In golf, people mature at different times and for different reasons,'' he added. ''Some guys break through earlier, some guys later. I feel that if he ever got through Tour school and gets out and gets settled, he'd do well.''</p>
        <p>Tour school is actually a series of tournaments in the fall in which 1,200 of the country's best pros compete for 35 open spots on the P.G.A. Tour.</p>
        <p>To the roughly 25,000 P.G.A. professionals in the country and the many more aspiring amateur golfers, the P.G.A. Tour card is the Holy Grail of golf. It allows automatic entry to Tour tournaments for a year, and almost every golfer who has ever made a birdie has dreamed of trying for one.</p>
        <p>But there are only about 200 Tour cards, and most pros, once they see how difficult it is to get (not to mention the school's $4,000 entry fee), usually settle for the comfort and stability of being a club pro and playing tournaments here and there.</p>
        <p>First-place prize money on Tour is usually more than $500,000 and the top 35 players all make well over $1 million. Aplayer can remain on the Tour for several years by winning one tournament.</p>
        <p>Van Orman insists he is playing his best golf ever, but he's aware that few golfers have begun Tour careers in their late 30's.</p>
        <p>A player like Tom Lehman, who went from the mini-tour to the pro tour at 32, is considered a late bloomer. Ben Hogan did not win a major tournament until he was 34, but he played the pro tour in his 20's. Even Jack Nicklaus's son Gary took 10 years to qualify for the Tour, and in his first season, last year, he earned $389,974. But then he's only 31.</p>
        <p>The fact is that even for most talented golfers the P.G.A. Tour is just not a realistic ambition. And Van Orman himself is the first to admit that his may not be the most sensible career choice.</p>
        <p>But it is, for better or worse, an addiction, he said. And once you have won a tournament or two, it is that much harder to kick.</p>
        <p>Last winter, for example, Van Orman broke a three-way tie by making birdie on the 72nd hole of a tournament in Chile in front of television cameras and thousands of cheering spectators.</p>
        <p>''There's no better feeling,'' he said. ''You're like a junkie, and that's what you keep chasing. It's not so much the golf, but the competition. If I became a salesman, I might not even play golf on the weekends.''</p>
        <p>He also likes to play golf for money. He speaks of the Tour the way Willie Sutton spoke of banks.</p>
        <p>''The money is so great on the Tour today, God knows how much I could make,'' he said, watching two children with matching outfits swing cut-down 5-irons on the club practice tee. ''It's an unlimited income. You could get out there for a few years and make enough to live for the rest of your life. Then</p>
        <p>Van Orman is 6-foot-2 and about 225 pounds. He can drive the ball 300 yards and hits his 8-iron 175 yards.</p>
        <p>Twice he was among 35 players to qualify for the National Long Driving Competition finals in Aruba, and he hit the fifth longest drive, 357 yards in 1995. He is also a fine putter, winning $7,000 for finishing 22nd in the 1996 Dave Pelz World Putting Championship in Florida in 1996, alongside Payne Stewart and Brad Faxon.</p>
        <p>Somewhere in between, though, there are a few weaknesses in his game. He can get wild off the tee. He swings hard at the ball, and his hands sometimes lag behind, sending shots off to the right. Also, his short irons need work.</p>
        <p>And then there's his head. He has often botched a string of low scores at a tournament by shooting one poor round. At the Met Open Championship in August in West Caldwell, N.J., it was a 77. At the State Open in Bethpage, N.Y., it was a 76. In June, he failed to qualify for the Buick Classic, and the next day he qualified for the U.S. Open.</p>
        <p>Van Orman learned golf as a boy from Clarence Fogal, who was the head pro at Salem Country Club, the Van Ormans' club. At 13, Bill was still a bit scrawny and used women's clubs, which were light and whippy. But he hit the ball hard, recalled Fogal, and ''was never satisfied with mediocre shots.''</p>
        <p>Fogal now runs Sedgewood Country Club, a private nine-hole course on a mountain in Carmel. He drives the tractor, mows the grass, keeps the books and gives the occasional lesson to a member. But he is still Van Orman's guru.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fogal took a pragmatic approach to golf. He taught Van Orman that there is only one ''moment of truth'' in the swing: impact -- when club meets ball. He calls it ''the answer'' and makes his students build their swing around it. He scoffs at ''all this graceful stuff in golf swings'' he sees in the new generation of golfers. ''You don't hit a golf ball with the back swing.''</p>
        <p>He taught Van Orman to play by feel. While most of today's players vary their shots by making systematic adjustments to their alignment and grip, Van Orman shapes his simply by visualizing them before hitting.</p>
        <p>In fact, Van Orman is really of a different era from young players today. Growing up, his heroes were golfers like Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson and Johnny Miller, who many young golfers today regard as historical figures.</p>
        <p>Van Orman gets his tremendous length from a ''deep set,'' the sharp cocking of the wrists before impact. His hands explode through the ball.</p>
        <p>''When he's playing his A-game, I don't know who the hell could stay with him,'' Fogal said. ''He's awesome. He's longer than Woods off the tee. If he stops pushing the ball, that's a mean game he's got there. With his length, there are no par 5's on the golf course for him. He chews up a golf course and turns into a pitch and putt.''</p>
        <p>In high school in Ridgefield, Conn., Van Orman became an All-American golfer and won the state championship in 1981. At the University of Alabama he made the golf team as a walk-on when its top three players were Steve Lowrey, Lee Rinker and Tom Garner, all of whom made it to the Tour.</p>
        <p>By his junior year, Van Orman earned a full scholarship and then qualified as an amateur for the 1985 U.S. Open at Oakland Hills, becoming the first golfer at the university to play in the Open while still in college.</p>
        <p>He missed the cut there, but turned pro after college and began playing mini-tour events. His father agreed to support his effort, but three years later told Bill he'd have to make it on his own.</p>
        <p>Van Orman took a teaching pro job at Salem Country Club, going south in the winter to keep trying for the Tour. When he turned 30, Salem offered him a job as the head pro, but Van Orman declined because it would have hampered his tournament schedule.</p>
        <p>He married Kim in 1994 and moved into her three-story town house in Carmel. Then he took several different jobs at Westchester clubs as a teaching pro before coming last year to Sleepy Hollow, an exclusive club on a former Rockefeller estate whose member list includes several Rockefeller families. Van Orman teaches the children of the actor Bill Murray, also a member.</p>
        <p>He spends most of his day around the teaching area, in a wooded corner of the club's property. The teaching shack is in disrepair, with a crumbling ceiling and various teaching aids scattered around.</p>
        <p>It's a lazy place, and seeing a prodigious golfer like Van Orman hanging around is like something out of the movie ''Tin Cup,'' in which Kevin Costner plays a talented golfer whiling away the days on a dusty Texas driving range, waiting for his big break on the pro tour.</p>
        <p>The club keeps his lesson load light enough to practice and play tournaments. The members enjoy having a successful club pro -- Van Orman compares it to ''owning a racehorse'' -- because he consistently gets the club name high on the local tournament leader boards. And what could be better than their own pro walking up the 18th fairway on national television on Sunday afternoon?</p>
        <p>At the club, Van Orman always has a good word for the members. He is charming to the women and disarmingly self-deprecating to the men. He is quick to chat about members' games and always calls them ''Mr.'' or ''Mrs.''</p>
        <p>But those who know him say that the more tournament success he enjoys, the harder it is to resume his cheery assistant pro job. In June, he was the club's U.S. Open hero. Members jammed the clubhouse to watch for him on television. The next Monday, they were congratulating him as he headed back to the range to give lessons.</p>
        <p>Kim Van Orman recalls that on the plane home from the Open, after playing better golf than some of the world's best players, he groused for a moment about playing poorly.</p>
        <p>''And now tomorrow I'm back to giving lessons again,'' she recalled his saying.</p>
        <p>When the two met 12 years ago, she was working in the pro shop at Salem Country Club and thought golf was ''this geek game'' for silver-spoon kids.</p>
        <p>But that was not Van Orman, who was squeezing in practice time between work shifts in the pro shop. He shared an apartment in Connecticut with a friend and was just scraping by.</p>
        <p>''When I met him, he was fishing in his car seat for dimes and quarters to pay tolls,'' she said. ''To be there and still trying to make it playing golf, that's hunger.''</p>
        <p>Life with a struggling golf pro, she said, has been ''a lot of ups and a lot of downs.''</p>
        <p>She typically learns of his tournament victories when he phones her from another state or country. The other months, they see each other late nights and early mornings. He works seven long days a week and never takes a day off.</p>
        <p>''I knew what I was getting into,'' said Kim Van Orman, who works long hours as an administrator at Reader's Digest. ''I spend a lot of time alone, even when he's up here. It's good that I have a job I love and work long hours at.</p>
        <p>''This is his dream; this is what he's living for, and I can't take that away from him.''</p>
        <p>Van Orman insists it is not an impossible dream.</p>
        <p>''If I do play my game,'' he said, ''I can play with anybody out there. I know I'm physically good enough, and I've known that since college. It's just a question of doing it consistently under pressure.''</p>
