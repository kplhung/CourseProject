        <p>Apple Computer released a work-in-progress version of its new operating system -- Mac OS X -- which had Macintosh addicts and computer-industry analysts buzzing. The beta software, publicly available from Apple's Web site for $29.95, is the first look at a complete overhaul of the system that was first released in 1984 with the original Macintosh. Mac OS X combines an intuitive user interface on top of a robust infrastructure based on the Unix operating system. The final version is scheduled for release in 2001, when it may help restore Apple's shine as an industry innovator in a marketplace dominated by Microsoft Windows.</p>
