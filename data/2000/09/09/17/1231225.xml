        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Soapbox ''Mmm, Mmm, Genetically Engineered'' (Aug. 27) by Jerry Flanagan assures us that yellow journalism is alive and well in New Jersey. Are we to believe that, as this patchwork of innuendo and less-than-half-truths implies, that Cambell Soups are harmful, in spite of their certification for soundness by both the Federal Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration?</p>
        <p>The essay mentioned a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that found that when a Brazil nut's gene was engineered into soybeans, people with nut allergies would have react badly to the beans. To raise this issue disregards the facts.</p>
        <p>Well before the soybean with the Brazil nut gene was ready for marketing, the seed company, Pioneer Hi-Bred, brought the new beans to the University of Nebraska to evaluate allergic potential. The results showed that the beans could induce an allergic reaction. Knowing that allergic reactions to Brazil nuts were on the order of one in 100,000 and that the number of potential deaths from eating the beans would be less than two a year, the company canceled its soy bean program. That's what Mr. Flanagan should have told us. If Campbell's vegetables contain Brazil nut genes, fish genes or antibiotic marker genes, he should say so. Innuendo is uncalled for.</p>
