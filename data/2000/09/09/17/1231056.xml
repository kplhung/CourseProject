        <p>AS Charles Wright sees it, one of the greatest disparities between men and women has to do with touch. ''Women have the freedom to touch in public, and men don't,'' Mr. Wright, the artistic director of the downtown school Dance Space Center, says. ''Words like brotherhood are a little corny, but men do need a forum to be able express whatever they want.''</p>
        <p>His solution, In the Company of Men, is a series devoted to the theme of men. Now in its fifth season, the program, organized by Mr. Wright and presented at the Pace Downtown Theater Thursday through Sunday, is a celebration of the dynamic of men dancing together, in both joyous and virtuosic terms.</p>
        <p>The AIDS epidemic provided the impetus for Mr. Wright, who started In the Company of Men in 1994 as a way to honor male dancers, both living and dead. ''But if you took AIDS out of the picture, young boys are still not entering the dance force,'' Mr. Wright says. ''I always thought that the feminist movement would have a trickle-down effect; that it would suddenly be acceptable for men to be nurses, women to be doctors and boys to be dancers. But it hasn't happened. So part of the genesis of In the Company of Men is to do my part and say, 'This is a great profession.' ''</p>
        <p>With Jerome Foundation support, the series has transformed itself from a pickup group presenting existing pieces into a diverse, powerful forum for new work. This season, premieres are offered by eight choreographers. While Nathan Trice delves into mythology in ''Prophet and Betrayer,'' Andrew Asnes and John Selya -- former members of the Paul Taylor Dance Company and Ballet Theater, respectively -- present a hilarious number set to music by Duke Ellington and Coleman Hawkins.</p>
        <p>In ''Synch or Swim,'' Mr. Asnes and Mr. Selya tap effortlessly in an elegant soft-shoe routine and soar through the air in astonishing leaps and turns -- not wearing soft ballet slippers or jazz shoes but flippers. ''Dancing is hard enough,'' says Mr. Selya, who also performs with Twyla Tharp's new group. ''You know those people who run with ankle weights? When they take them off, they're winged gods. Well, if I can do an entrechat-huit in flippers, after I shed them?'' -- he raises an eyebrow dramatically -- ''Nijinsky!''</p>
        <p>There is an ecological message running throughout this riotous yet challenging piece. At the start, Mr. Selya sits on the side of a boat. He drinks a can of soda, crushes it and throws it into an imaginary ocean. Then the two dancers, in unison, explode in jumps and faux-swimming antics on the floor -- in one, they glide across the stage on their stomachs like acrobatic worms -- as sickly fish and garbage float by, pulled by strings.</p>
        <p>''We're funny by nature, but this is a serious eco-statement,'' Mr. Selya, an avid surfer, explains. ''So we put that message out against our little dance, and it's a nice juxtaposition.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Asnes, who retired from Mr. Taylor's company in August and danced briefly with Ms. Tharp, it is also an opportunity to have some fun. ''I didn't want to worry about making anything extraordinary,'' he says. ''The pressure when you leave a company like Paul's and choreograph is that everybody's looking to see what you can do. We just wanted to make something that we'd enjoy.''</p>
        <p>MATT JENSEN, an emerging choreographer based in Minneapolis, takes a more sober approach in ''Herakles and Ganymede,'' a duet inspired by Greek sculptures that depict men engaged in battle or desire. ''I wanted to see if I could diffuse the conflict and the sex of the images,'' he says. ''To see if there is another way for men to touch that doesn't have to do with fighting or sex.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jensen's ''Herakles'' directly addresses the stereotypes that Mr. Wright believes hamper male dancing -- that it deals only with issues of homoeroticism or aggression. But there is more at stake for Mr. Jensen: ''I like the idea that, for once, I won't have the dressing room all to myself.'' He laughs. ''I always felt left out. I missed out on all the gossip! This will be the one time when I get to be part of the crowd.''</p>
