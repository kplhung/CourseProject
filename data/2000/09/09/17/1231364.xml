        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Coping column ''A Patient Life of Sacrifice, Touching Many'' by Andrew Jacobs (Aug. 27) was a wonderful tribute to my late father, Peter Chow.</p>
        <p>But I want to make it clear that we did not close our laundry for a few days right after his death. Although my father died on a Sunday morning, we closed the business only on the following Friday and Saturday to attend his wake and funeral. My mother felt it would be too disruptive to close the next day, when our neighbors would depend on us for their laundry and dry cleaning needs. We gave advanced notice of the closing instead.</p>
