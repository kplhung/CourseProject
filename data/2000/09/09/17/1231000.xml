        <p>EYEWITNESS TO POWER</p>
        <p>The Essence of Leadership: Nixon to Clinton.</p>
        <p>By David Gergen.</p>
        <p>382 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster. $26.</p>
        <p>DAVID GERGEN is a resolutely unfashionable fellow. He assumes not only that the United States government remains indispensable, but that the president is the most important person in that government and -- most retrograde of all -- that no president can succeed without the consent of Washington's oft-maligned ''inside-the-Beltway'' elites. A cynic might note that as a member of one of those elites as well as a senior adviser to presidents, Gergen (full disclosure: with whom I am very slightly acquainted) is making a case for his own significance. Considering that in some circles he was as renowned for selectively leaking information as for providing Ronald Reagan with the immortal words, ''Are you better off today than you were four years ago?,'' the cynicism might be warranted. Nor does ''Eyewitness to Power'' completely dispel it. The subtitle is ''The Essence of Leadership: Nixon to Clinton.'' For which one might read: ''Dr. Gergen's prescriptions for running the country.''</p>
        <p>But hold the cynicism. Both while at the White House and as a commentator on public television's ''NewsHour With Jim Lehrer,'' Gergen was known for his civility, his devotion to the national interest and his appreciation that there is something more important than tomorrow's headline, qualities on display in this blend of professional memoir and governmental how-to manual. Besides, Gergen's prescriptions are valuable, even though -- or perhaps because -- they boil down to plain common sense. He never quite instructs presidents-to-be to eat their spinach. But he does tell them to get enough sleep, advice that might seem obvious but apparently was not to President-elect Bill Clinton, who seemed ''worn out, puffy and hyper'' after the 1992 election. As Gergen points out, that was hardly the only reason Clinton had an awful first year in office. He also ignored several of Gergen's other basic remedies, including the one about having clear divisions of responsibility on the White House staff. But planning a new administration in a fog probably didn't help.</p>
        <p>Perhaps nothing distinguishes Gergen's book from other White House memoirs more than the fundamental sympathy and respect he shows toward all the presidents he served. His criticisms are severe, but always seem to bear in mind his warning that ''our culture is too quick to tear down our presidents,'' all of whom, he said, were ''patriots who cared deeply about the fate of the country.'' While Gergen promises no ''tidbits of gossip,'' he does report that at one White House meeting Clinton and his wife got into a rip-roaring row that began as a policy dispute but quickly got personal while the senior staff ''sat in embarrassed silence.''</p>
        <p>Gergen makes no effort to hide his Republican loyalties, but there is no obvious partisanship here. Republicans hoping for a well-timed attack on Vice President Gore will be disappointed; Gergen says Gore ''often gave the president some of his shrewdest advice.'' Richard Nixon's Republicanism does not keep Gergen from attributing his downfall to ''demons within.'' Even Gergen's excessively generous treatment of Ronald Reagan owes less to political loyalty than to an appreciation of Reagan's demeanor and attitude, including his willingness to conciliate those Washington elites rather than go to war with them as Nixon and, later, Clinton did.</p>
        <p>Gergen's description of Reagan's strengths and successes are on the mark. But he underrates the debit side of the ledger. The Iran-contra scandal is mentioned but not examined. Gergen credits Reagan with using stories as ''a form of moral instruction'' that influenced policy. Only in a short ''postscript'' does he acknowledge that ''some of Reagan's stories weren't quite true,'' without considering the folly of basing policy on inaccuracy.</p>
        <p>Nor does he equate Nixon's systematic effort to undermine constitutional government with a few incidents of mifky-pifky in Clinton's Oval Office. But it is not entirely clear whether Nixon lying about Watergate is more distasteful to him than Clinton lying about Monica. Gergen appreciates the political thicket in which Clinton found himself. His opponents did not simply fight him, Gergen noted, ''many denied him legitimacy from his first day in office.''</p>
        <p>A future historian will have to deal with the predicament of the first modern president confronted by a well-placed, well-financed segment of the political community that refused to recognize his bona fides and was determined to drive him from office. As Gergen notes, this made it an act of ''extreme stupidity'' for Clinton to have handed them so much ammunition. Even without the Monica mess, it is clear to see why Gergen would be so exasperated with Clinton, who early on broke several of Gergen's fundamental rules: appoint a strong chief of staff, find a clear message, be consistent and decisive.</p>
        <p>Worse yet, Clinton diffused presidential authority by installing his wife in a West Wing office outside the White House chain of command, making her an independent power center. Like others, Gergen assumes that this arrangement flowed from the intricacies of the Clinton marriage. But he does not join the simplistic conservatives who proclaim that marriage a political facade. Clinton ''needed the emotional approval of his wife on a daily basis,'' he writes.</p>
        <p>Gergen's reputation for civility has been sustained by his insistence on remaining soft-spoken, even after shouting replaced drinking as establishment Washington's recreation of choice. Blandness can be an advantage on the White House staff, and it seems to be an absolute job requirement, from which only Mark Shields is exempt, for being a male regular on ''The NewsHour.''</p>
        <p>Alas, it is less salutary in writing. Gergen writes clearly, but without style. Speeches need no style; 382-page books do, and its absence makes for slow going toward the end. Gergen's audience, then, will probably be limited to journalists and policy wonks. Here's hoping for one particular future reader. In the 73 days between Election Day and Inauguration Day, the president-elect ought to take this book over to a quiet corner for a few hours. Following its advice might do him, and the rest of us, some good.</p>
