        <p>The MetroStars kept reminding themselves the last few days how their top players -- Lothar Matthaus, Adolfo Valencia, Clint Mathis and Tab Ramos, to name a few -- had to raise their level in the playoffs after the team's dismal finish in the Major League Soccer regular season. No one spoke about Paul Grafer, the goalkeeper who joined the team with two games left in the regular season because of a season-ending injury to Mike Ammann and the absence of Tim Howard, on duty with the United States Olympic team in Australia.</p>
        <p>Valencia and Mathis came through Friday night, scoring the goals in the 2-1 overtime victory over the Dallas Burn at Giants Stadium in the opening game of their playoff series. Matthaus was a tower of strength on defense and Ramos linked the defense and the attack with intelligent plays. But it was Grafer who made perhaps the biggest contribution in the MetroStars' first playoff victory since 1996, when the league came into existence.</p>
        <p>Grafer saved a penalty kick to preserve the lead after Mathis had given the MetroStars the lead in the 34th minute with his first goal in five games. The crucial save came at a time when Dallas was pressing for the equalizer and gave the MetroStars a huge psychological boost because Grafer had allowed seven goals in his previous two games.</p>
        <p>Grafer saved Oscar Pareja's penalty kick by plunging to his right to gather the ball. The moment he made the save, he was mobbed by his teammates and the crowd of 14,868, the largest to attend a playoff game at Giants Stadium, erupted.</p>
        <p>''I finally feel I'm part of the team,'' Grafer said outside the dressing room after the game. ''It was a guess and an intuition,'' he said of the biggest save in his three starts for the MetroStars. He is now 1-2 as an M.L.S. goaltender, having moved up from the Long Island Rough Riders after they were eliminated from the A-League playoffs 10 days ago. His rocky start for the MetroStars included the 3-2 loss to Miami in the semifinals of the United States Open Cup last Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''To be successful in this league, you need the goalkeeper to make the big save,'' Coach Octavio Zambrano said. ''Paul made a huge save for us and lifted the rest of the guys.''</p>
        <p>Phil Wheddon, the MetroStars goalkeeping coach, spent extra time with Grafer practicing penalty kicks last Monday, and it paid off handsomely in Grafer's first appearance in an M.L.S. playoff game.</p>
        <p>Grafer's penalty-kick save preserved the MetroStars' lead until Dallas forward Bobby Rhine tied it in the 67th minute. The game remained deadlocked at the end of regulation and went into sudden-death overtime.</p>
        <p>Just when it appeared the game would end in a tie, Valencia did what he had done for years for the national team of Colombia, for Atletico Madrid and for Bayern Munich.</p>
        <p>Valencia and Mathis, his fellow striker, who scored his 17th goal, had difficulty displaying rapport for most of the night, but they connected perfectly at the last moment.</p>
        <p>Taking a pass from Mathis at the top of the penalty area, Valencia, the man nicknamed the Train for having the strength of a locomotive, turned quickly to his left, avoided two defenders and beat Matt Jordan with a left-footed shot for his 17th goal of the season. It was a move reminiscent of Giorgio Chinaglia in the glory days of the Cosmos two decades ago, when he regularly scored goals late in tied games.</p>
        <p>Valencia's goal came with 10 seconds left to put the MetroStars in a position to clinch the series with a victory at Dallas on Wednesday night. If a third game is necessary, it will be staged Saturday afternoon at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>''This goal is not for me,'' Valencia said. ''This is for the fans of the MetroStars. I knew there was less than a minute left when I got the ball and I thought of the fans.''</p>
        <p>From Zambrano to all the players in the dressing room, the MetroStars raved about the penalty-kick save by Grafer and Valencia's move on the winning goal. Ramos, who had another inspiring performance as the team's midfield general, was in awe of Valencia's move.</p>
        <p>''I came into the dressing and I told him it wasn't fair to come up with such a brilliant move,'' Ramos said. ''He's a striker a level above everyone else.''</p>
