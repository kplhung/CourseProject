        <p>TO be all things to all diners: such ambition has doomed many a restaurant. City Limits, however, that protean eatery in the hub of White Plains (a branch by the same name has opened in The Westchester), seems to accomplish the impossible with ease and panache. In terms of clientele and menu, this is, perhaps, the most diverse restaurant in the county -- the ne plus ultra diner. Lawyers lunch on poached salmon and salad alongside squirming children eating franks and ice cream sundaes. The place always seems to be hopping.</p>
        <p>City Limits is one of a handful of restaurants owned by the Livanos Family. The others -- Cafe Meze in Hartsdale and Oceana and Molyvos, both in Manhattan -- are more formal and prestigious, but they all work well within their genre. The resulting dishes, from short-order plain to white-frill fancy, remain as consistent as the chefs in charge. In an industry where kitchen turnover can be quarterly, these chefs have remained in Livanoses' kitchens for years -- a tribute to the owners.</p>

        <p>TO be all things to all diners: such ambition has doomed many a restaurant. City Limits, however, that protean eatery in the hub of White Plains (a branch by the same name has opened in The Westchester), seems to accomplish the impossible with ease and panache. In terms of clientele and menu, this is, perhaps, the most diverse restaurant in the county -- the ne plus ultra diner. Lawyers lunch on poached salmon and salad alongside squirming children eating franks and ice cream sundaes. The place always seems to be hopping.</p>
        <p>City Limits is one of a handful of restaurants owned by the Livanos Family. The others -- Cafe Meze in Hartsdale and Oceana and Molyvos, both in Manhattan -- are more formal and prestigious, but they all work well within their genre. The resulting dishes, from short-order plain to white-frill fancy, remain as consistent as the chefs in charge. In an industry where kitchen turnover can be quarterly, these chefs have remained in Livanoses' kitchens for years -- a tribute to the owners.</p>
        <p>We held off on the basket of terrific breads to do justice to the Middle Eastern vegetarian appetizer. Share this platter of assorted mashed vegetable and grain mixtures -- hummus, tabbouleh, baba gannoluj and particularly delectable tsatsiki (cucumber, yogurt and garlic) -- all to be scooped up on warm pita triangles. Or have a bamboo steamer holding five dumplings -- a charming presentation. Now a cliche, but a tasty one, butterflied coconut shrimp proved properly crisped; skip mango chili dipping sauce, an off note. While hearty chicken minestrone pistou had the requisite vegetables, the soup needed the kick of more garlic paste to take it out of the ordinary. Supposedly barbecued pork ribs were mealy, overly boiled and bland.</p>
        <p>Some salads were entree size. A spicy remoulade dotted the plate edge of seared tuna atop lovely greens tossed with ginger vinaigrette. Based on this success, we would try other salads, like five-spice roasted duck and scallops and shrimp.</p>
        <p>From the short list of pastas, homemade ravioli with simple tomato sauce was nicely turned out. But double saltings spoiled a dish of rigatoni with broccoli rape and good Italian sausage.</p>
        <p>A huge serving of free-range chicken, moist and good as it was, proved daunting. Based on the City Limits' fine breads, the light stuffing was a plus. Cut a tad too thin to be juicy, grilled, slightly smoky hanger steak was nonetheless flavorful.</p>
        <p>Scattered with shrimp and rings of calamari, a thick slab of roasted cod arrived glossy and succulent, and a bed of polenta made a perfect match in texture and taste. A mere brush with chive oil was all that was needed to bring out the goodness of salmon in a seared ginger crust. Skate (a special) was as deliciously fibrous, white and moist as this exquisite fish can be, and it deserved a pairing that would be classier than somewhat oily shrimp corn hash.</p>
        <p>Try one of the overstuffed wraps or sandwiches: grilled steak with Cheddar, curried egg with smoked salmon, grilled shrimp wrap with tsatsiki -- to name a few of the innovative yet compatible combinations.</p>
        <p>Of desserts, chocolate hazelnut crunch, rice pudding with rum-soaked raisins and summer fruit (berry) pudding were delightful and not overly sweet.</p>
        <p>From a broad price range, a three-course dinner with a hot entree averages $25 without drinks, tax and tip. The restaurant is opposite the County Center at Routes 119 and 100.</p>
        <p>City Limits Diner  200 Central Avenue,  White Plains. (914) 686-9000.</p>
