        <p>THE debate between Gov. George W. Bush and Al Gore is almost a side issue in the presidential race around here compared to the fireworks over how the Senate seat of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman should be filled should he be elected vice president.</p>
        <p>The Republicans want to stick to the law, which clearly states that the Republican Governor, John G. Rowland, gets to pick someone to fill the seat. But many of the state's Democrats, most notably Mr. Lieberman himself, say they have a better idea. Why not pass a law that would allow for a special election so the state's voters can make the choice? That, of course, would give a Democrat a chance for the seat, and that, of course, would be a law that might not survive a veto by Mr. Rowland.</p>
        <p>Democratic Party Chairman Edward Marcus said the governor wouldn't dare veto such a bill.</p>
        <p>''Then you would have the governor, with his one vote, take precedence over the state's voters.'' Mr. Marcus said, and the governor would face voter backlash. ''He would oppose it, but once it passed, he would accept it. If he didn't, that would be the end of John Rowland's political career.''</p>
        <p>Governor Rowland's spokesman, Dean Pagani, bristled at such a suggestion.</p>
        <p>''Voter backlash? The Democrats might suffer voter backlash once the debate gets going and voters realize this is really driven by partisanship and their desire to control the Senate seat,'' he said, adding that the governor wouldn't hesitate to veto the legislation.</p>
        <p>He also said the Democrats want it both ways. ''If the current governor were a Democrat, would Democrats be calling for a special election next year? No,'' Mr. Pagani said. ''They want Senator Lieberman to run for both offices; they don't want Governor Rowland to appoint his replacement.''</p>
        <p>These kind of situations used to be a lot simpler in the state. Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz said that prior to 1947, the law treated vacancies in congressional districts and for the Senate the same: it required a special election to take place within 90 days of the vacancy. But that year a GOP-controlled legislature changed the law to allow the governor to appoint someone to a Senate seat should one become vacant. That happened in 1949 when William Benton, a Democrat, was named to fill the vacant Senate seat of Raymond E. Baldwin, who had resigned for a judicial appointment, and in 1952 when William A. Purtell, a Republican, was named to the Senate after Senator Brien McMahon died in office. It hasn't happened since.</p>
        <p>Democrats, even with the uncertainty over the Senate seat, are thrilled with the dual candidacy of Mr. Lieberman, who has until Oct. 27 -- less than two weeks before the election -- to drop out of the Senate race. Political observers said Mr. Lieberman's popularity and his name on two different lines on the ballot will help elect Democrats across the state, especially those in close races. The Democrats who support Mr. Lieberman's running for two offices said news of Mr. Gore's selection didn't leave time for any contenders for the seat to hold a primary even if Mr. Lieberman had quit as senator immediately. The 72 members of the Democratic Central Committee, not the electorate, would have chosen the Senate candidate.</p>
        <p>State Representative Alex Knopp, a Democrat of Norwalk and chairman of the Joint Committee on Government Administration and Elections, said he wants to go back to holding a special election, which would be held a few months after the vacancy occurs, and plans to file such a proposal when the legislative session opens in January.</p>
        <p>But not all Democrats like the idea. Actually, it's Democratic leaders who are shying away from the plan. They see little point in trying to change the law because of the threatened veto by Mr. Rowland.</p>
        <p>Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin B. Sullivan, a Democrat of West Hartford, called the proposal to alter the law ''a politically motivated idea to embarrass the governor,'' and said, ''we have better things to work on during the session than that.''</p>
        <p>Democrats control the House of Representatives by a comfortable majority, but their control of the Senate is a far more slender 19 to 17. Both houses of the legislature would need a two-thirds vote to override a veto. Mr. Sullivan said the Senate is unlikely in November to pick up additional votes needed for such a margin. ''Such a bill is, at best, a long shot,'' he said. ''The governor will veto the legislation. The question then becomes, what is the point?''</p>
        <p>House Majority Leader Moira Lyons, a Democrat of Stamford, said that she would try to have an open mind on the issue, but added that a bill calling for a Senate election next year would lead to a contentious debate with no positive end result. ''I don't usually do things that way,'' she said. ''The mission of what we do has to be less political,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lyons said she would be reticent to support such a bill if the governor said he'd veto it. She said she would favor a proposal that would change the law for any future opening, but not a Lieberman vacancy. Governor Rowland has refused to speculate on who he would appoint to replace Mr. Lieberman. Neither would the Democrats, although the attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said he would run if the seat becomes vacant.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that Dick Blumenthal is the front-runner,'' Mr. Marcus, the party chairman, said. ''I wouldn't be surprised if one or more of our congressional candidates are interested. But it's an open process.''</p>
        <p>The man at the center of the controversy, Mr. Lieberman, said that principle, not political manipulation, is at the heart of his decision to run for two offices at the same time. ''The seat is too important and too valuable to pick the next senator for the next six years on the fly,'' said Dan Gerstein, a spokesman for Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>Will the senator stay in the race, or is there a possibility that he will drop out at the last minute?</p>
        <p>''He isn't a guy who believes in absolutes, Mr. Gerstein said. ''But he has said emphatically that he fully in tends to run for both offices.''</p>
