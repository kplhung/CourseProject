        <p>Justice Joseph K. West of State Supreme Court in White Plains has stayed Leonard Buddington's sentence of 40 hours of community service for disorderly conduct, pending the determination of his appeal. Mr. Buddington, a lawyer and the president of the Yonkers branch of the N.A.A.C.P., was sentenced by Judge Edmund Fitzgerald of Yonkers City Court last month for his role in a prayer demonstration at a school board meeting in June. On June 16, Mr. Buddington and other members of the Yonkers 13 group protested the firing of Yonkers' first black superintendent of schools. Randolph Scott-McLaughlin, a civil rights lawyer and the director of the Social Justice Center at Pace University, said the city was better served by Mr. Buddington's being allowed to work as a lawyer and president of the N.A.A.C.P. chapter.</p>
