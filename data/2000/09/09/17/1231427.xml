        <p>The city's largest union of librarians is angry that the New York Public Library has withdrawn a proposal that would have raised their salaries by 15 percent and greatly narrowed the pay gap with the suburbs.</p>
        <p>In August, library officials proposed the salary increase to satisfy the union's demands and to slow the exodus of librarians to the suburbs, where libraries often pay 20 percent more than the city's public libraries.</p>
        <p>But the New York Public Library, which runs libraries in Manhattan, the Bronx and on Staten Island,  scrapped its offer after City Hall objected to it, on the grounds that it did not provide for an increase in productivity.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration, recognizing that the library talks could set a precedent for citywide negotiations involving 300,000 municipal workers, said the 15 percent raise should be contingent on a longer workweek for the librarians. Specifically, City Hall called for a two-and-a-half-hour increase in the librarians' 35-hour workweek.</p>
        <p>Union leaders voiced outrage, saying that the city's librarians were already underpaid and pointing out that the city was projecting a $3 billion surplus.</p>
        <p>''Librarians simply cannot live on their salaries,'' said Ray Markey, president of the union local representing 1,800 librarians and library aides in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island. ''They're leaving the libraries in record numbers. And to say we have to increase productivity is outrageous given the fact that, with the loss of many librarians, those who remain are already overworked.''</p>
        <p>The starting salary for the city's librarians, who are required to have master's degrees, is $31,296, and the median salary is $39,000.</p>
        <p>Union leaders say City Hall's approach to the talks reflects the mayor's goal for the municipal labor negotiations -- to squeeze more productivity out of city workers.</p>
        <p>''They wanted us to break the 35-hour workweek for the rest of the city workers,'' Mr. Markey said. ''If they could get us to do it, they would use it as a bargaining chip. We refused to play that role.''</p>
        <p>Because the librarians' union is part of District Council 37, the giant municipal union, the 15 percent raise proposed by the library would be in addition to any annual raises that the district council negotiates for librarians and other municipal workers.</p>
        <p>Library executives acknowledge that the city's libraries are nearing a staffing crisis because the salaries have made it hard to attract new librarians. Many city librarians have left for higher paying jobs in the suburbs, private industry and the city's public schools.</p>
        <p>The situation is so bad, library officials say, that one-third of the branch libraries in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island no longer have a children's librarian.</p>
        <p>''We do not view the library as being in a crisis mode, but if the current trend continues we can get there,'' said Michael Zavelle, senior vice president for administration at the New York Public Library.</p>
        <p>For three years, the library and Mr. Markey's union have discussed ways to increase salaries, with library management taking the unusual step of saying its workers needed a 15 percent catch-up raise.</p>
        <p>An elaborate proposal that the public library and union officials agreed to in mid-summer called for an immediate 15 percent raise and for giving many librarians promotions and added responsibilities. To help finance that deal, the library also proposed cutting its 522 librarian positions by about 70 and and also cutting $600,000 from the book-buying budget for its research libraries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zavelle said, ''We made it clear to the union that this proposal depended on nonobjection from the city,'' which provides most of the library's budget.</p>
        <p>But City Hall officials did object. Union and library officials said the Giuliani administration disliked the proposed cuts in staffing and book buying because those moves would hurt service. Indeed, the city offered the library money to prevent any such cuts. In addition, city officials demanded productivity increases.</p>
        <p>So the New York Public Library withdrew its proposal to the librarians, thereby angering the union.</p>
        <p>''The library should stick to its guns and make good on this offer,'' said Christine Karatnytsky, who earns $39,000 after working 16 years as a librarian at the Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.  But Mr. Zavelle said the union should seriously consider the proposed two-and-a-half-hour increase in the workweek.</p>
        <p>''It's a uniquely New York situation'' he said. ''Every other library system in the country, except Boston, works 37.5- or 40-hour weeks.''</p>
        <p>Hoping to resolve the dispute, James F. Hanley, the city's labor commissioner, is scheduled to meet with officials from the librarians' union and the New York City Public Library late this month. Mr. Hanley did not return several telephone calls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zavelle said the New York Public Library deserved credit for backing the union's demand for a raise. ''Much to everyone's surprise, we achieved after three years something the union has never done,'' he said. ''We managed to put on the table real money, a real increase. It's an unusual situation because you have both management and the union fighting for a 15 percent increase.''</p>
