The activities will be repeated from noon to 5 p.m. next Sunday. (631) 765-1766.</p>
        <p>The emphasis will be on growing things at the Bayard Cutting Arboretum Horticultural Society's Fall Flower and Harvest Show in Oakdale from noon to 4 p.m. and again from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. next Sunday. On Saturday, Bill Fix will talk about wild creatures at 1 p.m., and at 3 p.m.  mushrooms will be Brian Feil's topic. Master gardeners will be on hand to answer questions. (631) 581-1002.</p>

        <p>From Weill to the Baroque</p>
        <p>Three music series will resume this week. On Tuesday, the Joseph G. Astman International Concert Series will get under way at Hofstra University with ''Celebrating the Kurt Weill Centenary.''

        <p>'Celtic Rock'</p>
        <p>Geography can be deceiving. Take Seven Nations, for example. The five members of this pop group are from Florida. But that doesn't stop them from producing what they call ''Celtic rock.'' While committed to Scottish roots, the quintet, complete with bagpipes and fiddle, plays American pop and rock, producing a hybrid sound that fuses the two genres. Seven Nations will make its Long Island debut on Friday at 8:30 p.m. at the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center on Main Street. (631) 288-1500.</p>
        <p>A Singing Nun</p>

Sister Mary, a member of the Community of the Sisters of Mercy, based in Rockville Centre, has been a professional performer for some 20 years. She will be joined by her band, the Reflections, and performers from the Mulvihill Lynch School of Irish Dance in Centereach. (631) 283-9140.</p>
        <p>Talk Shows</p>
        <p>Among the lectures that dot the schedule this week, two stand out. Tomorrow, Rex Reed, the film critic and raconteur, will talk with Shirley Romaine, the host of Cablevision's ''Art Scene on Long Island,'' about his life in show business and what's hot and what's not among the fall movies at 7:30 p.m. at the Cinema Arts Center on Park Avenue in Huntington. (631) 423-7610.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Dr. Phyllis Tortora, a retired professor of costumes and textiles at Queens College, will discuss''Underwear of Yesteryear,'' using slides and vintage designs from the Huntington Historical Society's extensive collection to make her points. Her talk will be at 7:30 p.m. at the Conklin Farmhouse Museum on High Street in Huntington. (631) 427-7045.</p>
        <p>'Family Fun Day'</p>
        <p>Today at 5 p.m., a concert by Tom Paxton, the folk singer, will conclude what's billed as Family Fun Day at Old Westbury Gardens Children's activities including face painting, bubble blowing and an old-fashioned hay toss, will begin at 3 p.m. In case this isn't enough for one day, the gardens will also be the host for a BMW, Ferrari and Porsche car show from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (516) 333-0048.</p>
        <p>Free Choices  TODAY  Library concerts are back after a summer hiatus.

TOMORROW  Richard Hamm, a history professor at the State University at Albany, will present ''The Prosecutor and the Showgirl: A New York Story,'' a discussion of the Harry Thaw-Stanford White-Evelyn Nesbitt scandal, at a meeting of the Three Village Historical Society at 7:30 p.m. at Neighborhood House on Main Street in Setauket. (631) 751-3730.</p>
        <p>TUESDAY  The Hillwood Art Museum on the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University in Brookville is beginning a weekly series of Tuesday art lectures, which will continue through Oct. 17. For the first lecture, Peter Moriarity, a member of the Post art department faculty, will talk about important photographs of the 20th century at 7 p.m. at the museum in Hillwood Commons.

Not by coincidence, Mr. Friedman will give a concert on Saturday at the Stephen Talkhouse in Amagansett. But that appearance isn't free. (631) 267-3117.</p>
        <p>SATURDAY  ''Memories of Jewish Lithuania,'' two groups of photographs -- one taken by George Birman in Lithuana before, during and after World War II, and the second from Antanis Sutkus's album of survivors of the Kaunas (Kovno) ghetto -- can be seen through Oct. 22 at the Great Neck Library on Bayview Avenue.
