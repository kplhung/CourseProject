        <p>At the heart of the recently settled strike between Verizon Communications and its telecommunications workers were the high stress levels experienced by service representatives. One possible culprit -- and something not explicitly addressed by the settlement -- was the fact that a companywide values statement clashed with reality in the area of customer service.</p>
        <p>The conundrum is common in business:  How can a company ensure that a stated set of values, put into place to help drive it forward, does not conflict with that goal or with how employees are treated?</p>
        <p>The core values in Verizon's statement, recently published on one page of the company's newsletter, are integrity, respect, imagination, passion and service. But one stark example of the disconnection at Verizon was the company's request that customer service representatives end each call with the scripted question, ''Did I provide you with outstanding service today?'' Having just calmed an irate customer, a representative offering such a response -- clearly tied to Verizon's core value of service -- could set him off again. The request was cited by strikers as one cause of stress.</p>
        <p>The problem with scripts is that they ''don't sound natural, and you wouldn't believe that I was even concerned about you, '' said Melissa Morin, the president of local 1400 of the Communications Workers of America, based in Portsmouth, N.H., and a customer service representative for Verizon and its predecessors since 1977.</p>
        <p>More troubling, scripts, even if intended to promote better and more measurable service and sales, may fly in the face of Verizon's other stated values. What kind of imagination does a company value, for example, if it is asking service representatives to stick close to a script? What kind of respect does it show for their abilities?</p>
        <p>In the notes accompanying its values statement, Verizon said it had relied on the framework set forth in the best-selling book, ''Built to Last'' (HarperCollins, 1994), which said visionary companies have core values and a core purpose. But James C. Collins, its  co-author with Jerry I. Porras, said those values were not enough in themselves. The key ''is to preserve the core values and purpose, and stimulate change, improvement, innovation and renewal -- at the same time, all the time,'' Mr. Collins said in an interview.</p>
        <p>''Part of stimulating progress is giving people a lot of freedom to adapt to specific situations in the best, most progressive way,'' he added. ''It sounds like the scripts were a very well-intentioned step, but a step that took away the freedom that's needed to truly live the values.''</p>
        <p>James A. Smith, a Verizon spokesman, said that customer service representatives ''don't have to do anything by script,'' and that the scripts were just a ''management tool of measurement.''</p>
        <p>''Service representatives are taught to analyze the caller,'' he added, ''and then lay against him a script that works to promote a specific product.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Smith pointed out, their compensation is tied not only to whatever product is sold but also to how well customers, in later surveys, rate the service provided.</p>
        <p>So the service representatives may be getting a mixed message about what the company really values. ''When there's such a strong incentive to meet a production number, in some sense you can be tacitly encouraging shortcuts,'' said David Gebler, president of Working Values, an ethics training firm based in Boston.</p>
        <p>At Verizon, the conflict of such demands  with stated values is not lost on employees -- and has wide implications. ''Employees understand the values statement,'' Ms. Morin said. ''But I don't know that they believe the company is following its own words. They went into this micromanaging period where they started timing everything, picking every single word apart. People sort of just look at the values statement and go, 'yeah, right.' It's just a piece of paper.''</p>
        <p>Values statements that do not reflect reality can do more harm than good, by fostering cynicism and anger. Rather than creating a statement just because great businesses do so, a company's managers may better spend their time finding what values exist within the company, and determining whether those values foster the type of company they want. If the answer is no, the managers should figure out how to respond.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a big fan of the 'right statement' model of the world,'' Mr. Collins said. ''I'm more a fan of the 'get clear, skip the statement' part.''</p>
