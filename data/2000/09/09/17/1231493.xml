        <p>Though voters in Oregon and Washington State rejected Mr. Bush's  father in both 1988 and 1992 and gave President Clinton a wide margin of victory four years ago, the Texas governor has repeatedly said he expects the Pacific Northwest to be highly competitive.</p>
        <p>The latest polls agree, showing Mr. Bush barely behind Mr. Gore in Washington and essentially even with him in Oregon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has made repeated visits to the Northwest, most recently last week, in which he criticized Mr. Gore's environmental record but also reiterated his staunch opposition to proposals to help salmon runs by breaching dams in eastern Washington. Such proposals are favored by many environmentalists but are anathema in many communities in the affected region.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush could be helped by a variety of factors, one of which is the strong popularity in some Northwestern cities of Mr. Nader, who drew 10,000 people to a rally in Portland, Ore., recently and who, most analysts say, draws many more left-leaning voters from Mr. Gore than he does from Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>In Washington State, Mr. Bush could be helped by a strong turnout for Mr. Nader, by his stand on dams that could energize a vote in parts of eastern Washington, and perhaps even by lingering resentment in the home state of Microsoft to the federal government's antitrust case against the software giant.</p>
        <p>A poll of 500 Washington voters taken for KING-TV in Seattle last week indicated that Mr. Gore was at 45 percent, Mr. Bush at 41 percent, Mr. Nader at 5 percent and Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party at 1 percent, with the rest undecided. The survey had a margin of sampling error of 4 percentage points.</p>
        <p>A separate Washington State survey by Moore Information of Portland, which has polled for many Republican candidates in the region, found Mr. Gore at 44 percent, Mr. Bush at 43 percent and Mr. Nader at 4 percent.</p>
        <p>That poll also was of 500 voters, with a margin of sampling error of 4 percentage points. But a Democratic pollster, Mark Mellman, conducting a regular tracking survey of 200 voters for an upcoming United States  Senate primary, found Mr. Gore in the lead by roughly 10 points.</p>
        <p>In Oregon, a poll taken this week for The Oregonian and KATU-TV  showed Mr. Nader at 8 percent, leaving Mr. Gore with 42 percent, virtually tied with Mr. Bush at 41 percent. About 8 percent of those surveyed were undecided, and the support for  Mr. Buchanan was negligible.</p>
