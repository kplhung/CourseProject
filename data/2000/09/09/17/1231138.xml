        <p>Samuel G. Freedman's article ''Where the Arts Still Sustain the Social Compact'' [Sept. 3] presents a wealth of information and insight on the connections between the labor movement and New York's cultural life during the 1930's and 40's. However, missing from the survey is any mention of the modern dance scene of that era. Several dance groups formed the Workers Dance League, and they always participated in the massive May Day Parade, doing their socially minded dances on the long march down Fifth Avenue to Union Square. The Federal Theatre Project's dance wing gave many budding choreographers teaching and performing work. Those who developed both their artistry and their social consciousness during those times include Anna Sokolow, Jane Dudley, Sophie Maslow, Helen Tamiris and Edith Segal, with the artistic giants Martha Graham and Doris Humphrey occasionally involved. They contributed to the growing cultural labor movement that Mr. Freedman discusses by going to offices and factories to give dance classes to the workers, and by choosing themes for their dances like labor strikes, solidarity between black and white workers, and the Spanish Civil War.</p>

        <p>Ellen Graff's excellent account of the period, ''Stepping Left: Dance and Politics in New York City, 1928-1942'' (Duke University Press, 1997) shows the richness of this often-forgotten period in American modern dance.</p>
