        <p>Two scientists whose work helped virtually eliminate the risk of transmitting viruses that cause hepatitis through blood transfusions were among six winners of this year's Albert Lasker medical research awards being announced today.</p>
        <p>The two winners of the Lasker clinical research award are Dr. Harvey Alter of the National Institutes of Health and Dr. Michael Houghton of the Chiron Corporation in Emeryville, Calif. Dr. Alter leads a project that N.I.H. created many years ago to discover the causes of hepatitis that followed transfusions. Dr.  Houghton led a team that discovered the hepatitis C virus in 1989.</p>
        <p>The winner of a special achievement award is Sydney Brenner of the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley, Calif., who was honored for his creativity and for discoveries that opened research in the genetic code and several other major fields over the last 50 years.</p>
        <p>For example, Dr. Brenner's team studied the roundworm, C. elegans, to trace the birth and death of every cell in a living animal. The scientists cut the worms into thousands of thin slices and took pictures through an electron microscope to track the connection of all nerve cells with one another. That provided a detailed picture of the wiring of the nervous system in the entire animal.</p>
        <p>The Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation said it also was honoring Dr. Brenner for his trenchant wit, his rational voice in allaying fears that research on genetic engineering would create dangerous microbes and for his role in ending a moratorium on such research in 1974.</p>
        <p>In that effort, Dr. Brenner drank genetically weakened bacteria in a self-experiment. He showed that such bacteria survived very poorly compared with bacteria that normally came through his intestines and thus would not survive well outside the laboratory.</p>
        <p>Genetic engineering techniques of transferring genes from a dangerous organism to a safer one now allow scientists to work with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and other lethal microbes.</p>
        <p>The basic medical research award went to three scientists: Aaron Ciechanover and Avram Hershko of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel, and Alexander Varshavsky of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.</p>
        <p>They were honored for discovering  the broad significance of the body's method of destroying proteins. That process helps regulate cell growth and division and the role of cells in immunity, inflammation and cancer. The process is named after a small protein known as ubiquitin.</p>
        <p>In announcing this award, the foundation said that after scientists cracked the genetic code in the early 1960's, they focused on protein production and lost almost all interest in protein destruction.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hershko and Dr. Ciechanover learned that cells eliminate proteins with the same degree of sophistication that they manufacture them.</p>
        <p>Malfunctions in the ubiquitin system can cause disease. One example is cancer of the cervix, caused by the papilloma virus, which produces a protein that attaches to another protein, p53, that usually stops uncontrolled cell division. But the binding leads the cell to react as if normal p53 is defective and should be destroyed. Ubiquitin also is involved in a rare inherited condition known as Angelman syndrome, which leads to mental retardation and movement  problems. Scientists are investigating whether the ubiquitin system contributes to autoimmune disorders like lupus.</p>
        <p>At the institutes of health, Dr. Alter found that about 30 percent of people who received blood transfusions 30 years ago developed hepatitis, chiefly from blood collected from paid donors. He also participated in the discovery of the hepatitis B virus. The findings led the United States to change to an all-volunteer blood-donation system and to require tests to remove hepatitis B-contaminated blood from the supply.</p>
        <p>Still, post-transfusion hepatitis continued, and Dr. Alter's team showed that such cases did not result from the two hepatitis viruses known at the time, A and B. So they called it non-A, non-B hepatitis.</p>
        <p>By injecting blood from people with non-A, non-B hepatitis, the scientists produced hepatitis in chimpanzees, proving that a transmissible agent was involved. Dr. Alter coded samples of blood from non-A,  non-B hepatitis patients. Over the years, about 20 research teams thought they had discovered the virus causing non-A, non-B hepatitis. But each time, Dr. Alter broke the code, showing that the scientists did not have the culprit.</p>
        <p>In 1982, Dr. Houghton's team began hunting for the missing hepatitis virus by using genetic engineering techniques to study DNA and RNA from infected non-A, non-B hepatitis cases. After further research, on tens of millions of bacteria, the team's members used Dr. Alter's coded samples to prove they had identified the hepatitis C virus.</p>
