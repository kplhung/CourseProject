        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As much as I enjoyed Mr. Conget's reminiscences, I was more than slightly horrified to note how very normal the fact of homelessness has become. Clearly, it's as much a part of living in New York as seeing famous actors on the street. Doesn't anyone else find this appalling?</p>
        <p>In Mr. Conget's beautiful remembrances, not one but two homeless people figured prominently.</p>

        <p>As much as I enjoyed Mr. Conget's reminiscences, I was more than slightly horrified to note how very normal the fact of homelessness has become. Clearly, it's as much a part of living in New York as seeing famous actors on the street. Doesn't anyone else find this appalling?</p>
        <p>In Mr. Conget's beautiful remembrances, not one but two homeless people figured prominently.</p>
        <p>As a communications director for a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending chronic homelessness, I'm supposed to be glad for newspaper coverage but I'm not. Homelessness is a relatively new, bad development but it need not be permanent. Let's invest our time and resources now in finally doing away with this scourge, while prosperity is here. The alternative is that homelessness becomes as identifiable a part of the New York experience as our magnificent skyline.</p>
