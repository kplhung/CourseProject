        <p>Bill Geist Op-Ed column says cheerleading is no more unsuitable for inclusion in Olympics than some of the events that will be held this year in Sydney (M)</p>

        <p>There is news this week that cheerleaders want to be included in the Olympics, and to that I say: ''California oranges, Arizona cactus, we play Kuala Lumpur just for practice!''</p>
        <p>Let 'em in! We could use some more school spirit, nationwise, around here. Except, apparently the cheerleaders don't want to stand on the sidelines anymore; they want to compete.</p>

        <p>There is news this week that cheerleaders want to be included in the Olympics, and to that I say: ''California oranges, Arizona cactus, we play Kuala Lumpur just for practice!''</p>
        <p>Let 'em in! We could use some more school spirit, nationwise, around here. Except, apparently the cheerleaders don't want to stand on the sidelines anymore; they want to compete.</p>
        <p>It's not that far-fetched. Cheerleaders swear they don't lead cheers anymore, that they train and practice and jump and tumble and receive scholarships in their sport and even turn pro (although some pro cheerleaders do appear to have lap-dancing backgrounds).</p>
        <p>So, why not? The Greeks started the Olympics, and if the little blue drawings on my usually reliable carry-out coffee cups are historically accurate, their warriors wore short little cheerleader's skirts: ''V-I-C-T-O-R-Y, that's the Spartans' battle cry!''</p>
        <p>Oh sure, traditionalists who hold to the ''Faster-Higher-Stronger'' Olympic credo will argue that cheerleading does not require the speed of the sprinter, the spring of the high jumper, the strength of the discus thrower or the overall wrist pronation skills of the Ping-Pong player, the essential shuttlecock savvy of the badmintner or the waterproof makeup talents of the synchronized swimmer.</p>
        <p>The pantheon of Olympic sports has become a bit more of a fleamarketheon under the leadership of Juan Antonio (''Which way to the complimentary I.O.C. buffet?'') Samaranch, during whose tenure the Games have added almost everything human beings do (walking) and would otherwise not do (swim in synchrony).</p>
        <p>Mr. Samaranch and the others seem to like sports that look good on TV, such as the new Olympic sport of women's beach volleyball. I think he wanted Lingerie Modeling, but international diplomacy does involve compromise.</p>
        <p>Where in the ancient Olympics there were just a few foot races, there are now more than 10,000 athletes competing in about 300 events, many of which are enjoyed only at the Olympics, in family rec rooms and at backyard barbecues. If badminton and trampoline, why not other picnic competitions such as croquet, Jarts and pie eating?</p>
        <p>New this time are tae kwon do (Jackie Chan, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Mr. Miyagi are favored) and synchronized diving (although that sounds absurd, so maybe they said synchronized ''dining,'' mirror-image couples' eating). For gender equity, women may now throw the hammer -- although wouldn't this have been a great opportunity to just ask men to stop? And there's the triathalon, which combines swimming, running and biking. The Olympics loves odd combinations. The biathalon comprises shooting while skiing, so why not archery and trampoline?</p>
        <p>And how about that two-man luge, where one guy lies on top of another and they go down the hill on a sled? I'll bet I.O.C. members came up with that one when they had a few at a party: ''No, no, no . . . Juan Antonio . . . how about three guys on a luge holding a bowl of goldfish?''</p>
        <p>There is curling, of course, which is shuffleboard on ice that incorporates a strong element of housekeeping. And one that's trying to get in: ballet dancing on skis, which is akin to performing a Chopin piano recital with canned hams strapped to your hands.</p>
        <p>Scores of sports are pushing for admission, such as Frisbee (although yet to be ironed out is who gets the medal, the guy or the dog?) and alpinism, which had its application red-flagged when it was mistaken for a chafing condition caused by lederhosen.</p>
        <p>So, why not cheerleading? ''Bring It On,'' a movie about cheerleading, is a smash box-office hit. Cheerleading competitions are shown on ESPN. George W. Bush was a cheerleader. It would be beautiful: the rare sport in the summer Olympics in which men and women compete together. (They need men for pedestals.) And none of that unpleasant gender testing. The waiting room over at Gender Verification isn't pretty, let me tell you.</p>
        <p>A problem area might be that no one else does it. Cheerleading is an almost uniquely, or peculiarly, American phenomenon. Olympic officials say that to get in, a sport should be widely practiced in 75 countries on four continents. Yeah, right. Like rhythmic gymnastics, the Olympic sport where people in leotards run around with streamers. See it everywhere you go.</p>
        <p>Contract bridge made a strong bid to get into the Sydney Games. Yes, really, which would have made it the first Olympic sport to have bowls of mixed nuts on the field of play. And brace yourself, purists, the odds are that ballroom dancing will be in by 2004 or 2008. I like a sport where you can smoke and drink and train in nightclubs. Will there be mandatory blood testing for the presence of cosmopolitans?</p>
        <p>So why not cheerleading? Sooner a gold medal in Splits Waving Two Pompoms than one in Merengue.</p>
