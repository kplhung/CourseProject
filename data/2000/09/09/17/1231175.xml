        <p>In this seaside town of 2,600 people  which swells to 30,000 in the summer, where Joe Pesci bought a house for his mother and where the mayor strolls around in shorts -- you wouldn't expect a dispute over what a sidewalk is.</p>
        <p>Even more peculiar, the disagreement is setting the borough government against its 13-member police department. And resolving the rift over something so seemingly trivial appears headed for the courts at added expense to the taxpayers.</p>
        <p>Don't judge a book by its cover or a resort by its surf. Here, for instance, where charming houses line 1.5 miles of oceanfront, the police chief often sports a short-sleeved shirt with a department logo instead of a uniform. On the bay side, where Mr. Pesci bought his mother's house, newer homes sell for as much as a million dollars. Then there's the issue of the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>It started on Aug. 8 when a police officer ticketed the fire chief's car for being parked on the sidewalk in front of fire headquarters. Borough officials were at once surprised and angered, contending that there was no sidewalk there to begin with.</p>
        <p>''We've looked into it, and our opinion is it's an illegal ticket and therefore obviously he can't give it because this is not a sidewalk,'' Mayor Thomas Walls said at the site where the incident occurred.</p>
        <p>And a study of the ground at his feet did indeed seem to show no discernible sidewalk, but rather a continuous asphalt parking lot stretching from the firehouse to the curb about 200 feet away.</p>
        <p>Two feet from -- and parallel to -- the curb is a painted line. Going back obliquely from the line toward the firehouse are other painted lines creating spaces for eight cars to park. To the police, that is the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>Sitting in his office, Police Chief Frederick H. Swearingen, Jr. opened the New Jersey Police Manual, which included the state's motor vehicle laws, put it on his desk near some photos of the ''146 big eye'' he recently caught and pointed to Section 39:1-1 highlighted with magic marker.</p>
        <p>The manual read: ''Sidewalk means that portion of highway intended for the use of pedestrians between the curb line of the lateral line of a shoulder, or, if none, the lateral line of the roadway in the adjacent right of way line.''</p>
        <p>The chief said public safety was involved, especially when people had to walk in the street after concerts in a nearby park.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mayor Walls, 48, who owns three restaurants and a hotel, insisted that 60 percent of town had no sidewalks. ''If this is a sidewalk, there are 500 other places in town with the same situation,'' he said. ''Why single out the fire chief of all people?''</p>
        <p>Accounts differ.</p>
        <p>Mayor Walls put it this way: The lot had recently been paved and, on Aug. 8, the borough's Department of Public Works was painting parking lines. A worker wanted the fire chief's official car moved from near the firehouse so lines could be painted there. A councilman, James Borowski, who is also a volunteer firemen, moved it into one of the newly painted spaces near the curb. At 11 a.m. an officer, Raymond Toscano, ticketed the car. Aside from questioning the legality of the ticket, Mayor Walls said he felt professional courtesy was breached.</p>
        <p>''The police and fire departments should be brothers-in-law,'' he said. ''I can understand not getting along with your employer, the governing body. We're trying to work through that. What bothers me is giving a ticket to one of their own.''</p>
        <p>But Chief Swearingen had his own take on professional courtesy: About 7:30 a.m on Aug. 8, he received a call from Officer Toscano, who saw chalk lines near the curb for parking spaces that would block the right of way. The chief then asked the workmen to delay painting the lines until he could file a memorandum with the town administrator saying the spaces were in violation of state law.</p>
        <p>But as the chief was writing his memo, the workers had painted the lines.</p>
        <p>To Mayor Walls the ticket was just another example of bitterness arising from contentious contract negotiations with the police over the last three years, though the police denied there was a hidden agenda.</p>
        <p>Then why, Mayor Walls asked rhetorically, had he received 12 tickets in the last three years when in the previous 10 years he had never received any?</p>
        <p>Officer Walter G. LaCicero, president of Local 372 of the Patrolman's Benevolent Association -- noting that Willie Sutton  robbed banks because that's where the money was -- said: ''Maybe the mayor's getting tickets because that's where the violations are.''</p>
        <p>Officer LaCicero, who also happens to be Mayor Wall's next door neighbor, was the one who gave the mayor his first ticket -- for putting out his trash too early.</p>
        <p>Mayor Walls said this occurred soon after he had voted to suspend tuition payments to police officers taking college courses not directly related to police work. Officer LaCicero, who is a lawyer, was attending law school at the time.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Officer LaCicero said there was no personal animosity and that a neighbor had complained about the trash. ''I was the officer on duty,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, their relationship has become more coolly professional and less neighborly, although their wives continue to be good friends and one of the Walls children baby-sits for the LaCiceros.</p>
        <p>''We tried in good faith to perform our duty to look out for public safety,'' Officer LaCicero said about ticketing the fire chief. ''If we hadn't done something here and someone had been injured. they would have asked us why we hadn't done anything.''</p>
        <p>Since then, the department has issued a half-dozen more tickets, all to people taking part in a lunch program for the elderly. ''If you were to pull up here you would think this is a place to park,'' said Mayor Walls.</p>
        <p>Chief Swearingen agreed, but he added, ''We get paid by the town to enforce ordinances and state laws, and they can't really pick and choose the laws they want to enforce.''</p>
        <p>For now, it appears the case will go to court with an independent judge and independent prosecutor. A $44 ticket will cost thousands of dollars adjudicate.</p>
        <p>''These are the kinds of issues that affect a small town,'' Mayor Walls said, ''the sort of things that can win and lose elections.''</p>
