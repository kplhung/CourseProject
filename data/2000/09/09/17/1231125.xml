        <p>The Finger Lakes' sweep of the top five prizes -- best sparkling, white, red, blush and dessert wines -- in this year's New York Wine and Food Classic, the most important contest devoted exclusively to the state's wines, sends Long Island a message.</p>
        <p>True, only 70 of 140 wineries entered the competition, sponsored by the New York Wine and Grape Foundation, a trade organization. True, the outcome, while an index of statewide quality, achievement and direction, falls short of the ideal full picture. True, Finger Lakes entries outnumbered Long Island's four to one. Still, it's the best contest around.</p>
        <p>East End wines, even with steady improvements in quality and with the multimillion-dollar sales of a few wineries, remain largely a hard sell in New York City stores and restaurants. One reason is that producers face an apparently entrenched perception, fed by comparative shopping, that some of their wines are overpriced.</p>
        <p>For example, Paumanok charges $15 for its '98 dry riesling. But the '98 Seneca Lake dry riesling from Hermann J. Wiemer, who is arguably one of nation's leading riesling makers and which won a double-gold medal in the classic, costs $9, making it (discounts aside) $72 a case cheaper than Paumanok's. The '99 Seneca Lake dry riesling from Chateau Lafayette Reneau, which won the Governor's Cup as the state's best wine, costs $11 -- a $48 savings.</p>
        <p>Wiemer's '98 blanc de blanc, which won a double-gold medal and was voted best sparkling wine, costs a plausible $18 ($216 a case). On the Island, Wolffer Estate's '96 Cuvee Brut, which took a silver medal, is $29 ($348 a case), and Pindar's '94 Cuvee Rare, a silver-medal winner, is $28 ($336); at this level, French Champagne qualifies as a better deal.</p>
        <p>Some award winners will be sold at Vintage New York, a store that opened in SoHo in July and that specializes in New York wines. It is introducing a range of 150 from the Finger Lakes, Hudson Valley, Lake Erie and Long Island that downstaters have rarely if ever seen.</p>
        <p>At Vintage New York, which is open seven days because it is a satellite salesroom of a Hudson Valley farm winery, Rivendell, all the wines can be tasted. Robert Ransom, an owner, said that ''when the store succeeds'' he might open another, possibly on the East Side.</p>
        <p>If city residents awaken to the virtues of good Finger Lakes wines (especially rieslings, the nation's best), which routinely sell out at moderate prices far upstate, Long Island may well find even its weak handle on the New York wine franchise in the city whittled down.</p>
