        <p>Bassoonist Turned Jazz Artist</p>
        <p>Janet Grice of Ardsley took up the bassoon in seventh grade for a practical reason.  ''My school wanted someone to play it, and I had the longest fingers,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The musician excelled at the instrument, going on to study at the New England Conservatory of Music, but then she veered off the classical path. Instead of joining a symphony orchestra like most bassoonists, she  turned to jazz. Now besides teaching and playing in contemporary music ensembles, Ms. Grice plays and records jazz with the Janet Grice Quartet.</p>
        <p>Picture a double-reed wind instrument that is about four feet long (''about as tall as a fourth grader,'' Ms. Grice said) and is played either seated or standing. Spanning three octaves, the bassoon has a range similar to that of a cello. It has a deep, mellow voice whether the music is Berlioz or Brazilian acoustic jazz, which is the Grice specialty. ''Quite a few people have played jazz on the bassoon, but the violin and cello have had more recognition'' as crossover instruments, Ms. Grice said.</p>
        <p>She released her new CD, ''Dream Travels,'' this year with a quartet with drums, piano and bass and Ms. Grice on the recorder. She composed four of the nine pieces on the disc, available for $15 from jangrice@yahoo.com. The bassoonist and her trio will play on Oct. 15 at 3 p.m. at Greenburgh Town Court for the inauguration of a new art gallery in the courtroom.</p>
        <p>Teaching the Poetry of Writing</p>
        <p>Why teach writing? Some say it is to train students how to think.</p>
        <p>But the poet Ron Price, who teaches in the literary arts program of the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts in Mount Kisco, takes the opposite view. ''I don't understand what I think until I've gotten something clarified in words,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Not just any words, however. Mr. Price, who speaks as poetically as he writes, understands that straightforward writing can fall short. ''Some people can't express themselves adequately in analytic prose,'' he says. Enter poetry, where imagery puts a fine point on feeling. ''We tend to think of imagery as something visual, but an image is anything that appeals to the senses,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When teaching musicians at the Juilliard School in Manhattan, Mr. Price stresses sound and rhythm. ''The difference between analytic prose and music is the realm where lyric poetry hovers,'' he said. Meaning comes tumbling after poetic experience but is not unimportant. ''Not even Emily Dickinson didn't care about people not understanding her,'' he said (sounding as oblique as Dickinson's ''certain slant of light'').</p>
        <p>Mr. Price will offer 12 Wednesday workshops from 12 to 3 p.m. at the center beginning Sept. 27. (The fee: $414; information: 914)-241-6922.)</p>
        <p>A Harvest Celebration</p>
        <p>Liberal extremists or the conscience of Westchester? Wespac of White Plains has been called both, and there are few groups like it in the county. ''We are multi-multi-issue,'' said Joe Chamberlin, a longtime volunteer. ''Anti-nuclear, pro-choice, pro-family, equal rights, basic equality and justice. We also would like to free Mordechai Vanunu -- the nuclear whistle-blower in Israel -- and the Berenson woman in Peru.''</p>
        <p>Wespac holds its annual harvest celebration today from noon to dusk at 116 Hawkes Avenue in Ossining, where folk music artists like Stone Soup, James Durst and Alison Hartwell, pictured below left, will perform ($8, $2 for children). For directions, the number to call is (914) 941-2689.</p>
        <p>A Window on Mini-Galleries</p>
        <p>The Westchester Arts Council wants its funky old bank building to be a bastion of the cutting edge in downtown White Plains. For now, however, the council has closed off its first floor while construction of two bathrooms (accessible to the handicapped) is under way. To stay connected to passers-by, the council is turning its tall front windows into mini-galleries.</p>
        <p>''The windows will be a sign to the community of what's to come,'' said Janet T. Langsam, executive director of the council. ''Nothing says it better than the work of artists.'</p>
        <p>For information about submitting work, the number to call is (914) 428-4220, extension 241.</p>
