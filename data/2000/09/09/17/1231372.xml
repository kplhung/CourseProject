        <p>When employees quit or retire, their companies may lose more than valued workers. In some instances, the turnover can mean sharp declines in profits and market value, according to Sibson &amp; Company, a management consulting firm in Lexington, Mass.</p>
        <p>Sibson, a unit of Nextera Enterprises, recently studied four industries in which employee turnover was especially high -- specialty retail, call-center services, fast food and high technology -- and concluded that employee replacement costs reduced corporate earnings and stock prices by 38 percent, on average.</p>

        <p>When employees quit or retire, their companies may lose more than valued workers. In some instances, the turnover can mean sharp declines in profits and market value, according to Sibson &amp; Company, a management consulting firm in Lexington, Mass.</p>
        <p>Sibson, a unit of Nextera Enterprises, recently studied four industries in which employee turnover was especially high -- specialty retail, call-center services, fast food and high technology -- and concluded that employee replacement costs reduced corporate earnings and stock prices by 38 percent, on average.</p>
        <p>Over all, more than 6.5 million workers leave those industries each year, resulting in more than $75 billion in replacement costs alone.</p>
        <p>''Employee turnover has a significant effect on companies' bottom lines,'' said Seymour Burchman, a principal of Sibson. ''There's the direct cost of recruiting, training and orienting new employees. But it can also affect companies' ability to keep customers and acquire new ones, and affect productivity and growth.''</p>
        <p>Sibson's research, conducted over the summer, was based on several sources, including statistics from the Labor Department and the Census Bureau, as well as industry reports. The results were released last month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burchman said the specialty retail industry had an annual turnover rate of 97 percent, versus 15 percent for all American industries. ''That means that retail stores lose basically all their sales clerks every year,'' he said.</p>
