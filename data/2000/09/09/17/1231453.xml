        <p>Bicyclists have three more Sundays this season to pedal or skate -- without the interference of motor traffic -- on the Bronx River Parkway. Besides today from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., the other dates are Sept. 24 and Oct. 1. Under New York State law, bicyclists and skaters under 14 must wear a helmet approved by the American National Standard Institute, and children who are under 1 are not allowed on bicycles or separate seats attached to bicycles. The Bronx River Parkway from the County Center south to Scarsdale Road is set aside for bikes; north from the County Center to Fisher Lane is for skating.</p>
