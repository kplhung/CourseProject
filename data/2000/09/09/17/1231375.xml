        <p>Since man proposes and Nature disposes, buying bottles and cases of wine, and futures, is always a gamble. But the globalization of cutting-edge grape-growing and winemaking methods, with Bordeaux out front, has so diminished the chances of unacceptable wines that vintage chart generalizations are losing value.</p>
        <p>Although early tastings of Bordeaux's 99's suggest that many are iffy and lack depth, potentially rewarding wines are findable, as in troubled vintages everywhere. Good values have resulted from the vintage's early reputation, producers' reduced prices and the dollar's strength against the franc.</p>
        <p>Sherry-Lehmann, 679 Madison Avenue (61st Street), Manhattan, whose chairman, Michael Aaron, since 1959 has sold Bordeaux from good, poor and middling vintages, offers attractive '99 futures for $240 a case ($20 a bottle) and under. Supplies are limited, and prices are subject to change; you pay in full now and get the wine in 2002 (remember, potential income forgone from alternative investments adds to the price).</p>
        <p>The following '99 reds, listed by appellations, chateaus and prices -- first by standard-size bottle, second by case -- deserve attention (though the bottle prices of some exceed $20, the case prices meet that ceiling):</p>
        <p>Margaux Cantenac-Brown ($21, $235); Giscours ($21.25, $240, a good buy).</p>
        <p>Pauillac Grand Puy Ducasse ($18, $210); Haut-Batailley ($19.50, $220, a good buy).</p>
        <p>St.-Julien Branaire ($21.25, $240); Les Fiefs de Lagrange, second label of Chateau Lagrange ($13.50, $155, a best buy); Gloria ($19, $215).</p>
        <p>St.-Est'ephe Lafon-Rochet ($21, $235); Les Ormes de Pez ($16.65, $195).</p>
        <p>Graves La Louvi'ere ($16.50, $190, a good buy); Olivier ($17, $195, a good buy).</p>
        <p>Pomerol De Sales ($18, $210).</p>
        <p>St.-'Emilion Faug'eres ($18, $210, a good buy).</p>
        <p>Haut-M'edoc Camensac ($16, $180); Cantemerle ($16, $180, marginal).</p>
        <p>Moulis Chasse-Spleen ($16.65, $195, a best buy).</p>
