        <p>IT is essential to prune the shade trees around your house at least once a year. Sometimes the reasons for pruning are obvious. A severe storm can break limbs and leave them dangling from the trunk. Trees near the house with long limbs that hang over the roof offer a path into your home for squirrels and raccoons. Also, leaves falling from these limbs can collect in the gutters and clog the downspouts. Even if these conditions do not exist, careful pruning of diseased or dead limbs can produce healthier, fuller shade trees.</p>
        <p>The best time to prune trees is during the winter into the early spring when trees are dormant. The pruning will stimulate growth in the later spring and as the trees come to life and start growing, the pruning cuts will heal. Some deciduous trees, like maple, birch, elm and walnut, may ooze sap when pruned in the winter. While this is not a serious condition, it can be minimized by pruning them earlier in the fall.</p>

        <p>IT is essential to prune the shade trees around your house at least once a year. Sometimes the reasons for pruning are obvious. A severe storm can break limbs and leave them dangling from the trunk. Trees near the house with long limbs that hang over the roof offer a path into your home for squirrels and raccoons. Also, leaves falling from these limbs can collect in the gutters and clog the downspouts. Even if these conditions do not exist, careful pruning of diseased or dead limbs can produce healthier, fuller shade trees.</p>
        <p>The best time to prune trees is during the winter into the early spring when trees are dormant. The pruning will stimulate growth in the later spring and as the trees come to life and start growing, the pruning cuts will heal. Some deciduous trees, like maple, birch, elm and walnut, may ooze sap when pruned in the winter. While this is not a serious condition, it can be minimized by pruning them earlier in the fall.</p>
        <p>Naturally, you will need tools for pruning. Start with a simple hand pruner. These plier-like tools are good for trimming branches up to  3/4 of an inch in diameter. For thicker branches of up to 1 1/2 inches in diameter, invest in lopping shears. These have scissor jaws like the pruning shears but longer handles that give you more cutting power.</p>
        <p>Shears like pruners or loppers have two types of blade configurations: anvil or scissor. Shears with an anvil configuration have one sharp blade. The other blade is thicker and has no edge. This type of tool is useful for cutting back shrubs with a lot of dead seasonal branches. Anvil shears, however, actually crush and break the branches rather than cutting through them. Scissor shears have two sharp blades that bypass each other to make clean close cuts through the branch. These are the better choice for careful pruning tasks.</p>
        <p>For large branches, you will need a pruning saw. There are two types: the bow saw and the curved pruning saw. The bow saw has a straight flat blade secured in a rigid aluminum frame. The saw is lightweight and easy to handle, but the frame can be difficult to maneuver in close quarters.</p>
        <p>The curved pruning saw has a thicker curved blade mounted in a handle. Some curved saws have sockets in the handle that accept extension handles. These enable you to cut high branches without a ladder. Pruning trees is relatively safe work, but it's still a good idea to don safety gear like heavy-duty gloves, goggles and even a hard hat when you have to cut heavy overhead branches.</p>
        <p>Before doing any cutting, step back and survey the entire branch structure of the tree. Look for branches that may be broken and hanging. These pose a safety hazard and should be cut away first. Next, look for dead or diseased branches. These should be cut because they can spread their blight into the tree. When pruning dead branches, always cut back to healthy wood.</p>
        <p>Also look for stubs jutting from the trunk. Stubs are short projections resulting from bad pruning or a broken branch. Since the stubs bear no leaves, they quickly die and turn into dead wood. They should be cut from the trunk before they spread decay to the interior of the tree.</p>
        <p>Look for branches that cross and rub against each other. At least one of these branches should be cut off before it gets too big and weakens the overall structure of the tree. Finally, look at the base of the tree for suckers. These are short sprouts that grow vertically from the roots. They rob the tree of water and nutrients, yet add nothing to its structure.</p>
        <p>When cutting a branch, do not cut it flush with the trunk; this will create a wide wound that will take longer to heal. Instead, cut the branch back to the growth collar, the swollen trunk area at the base of the branch. Do not try to saw a branch through with one cut because the weight of the branch will cause it to fall away and tear a strip of bark from the trunk.</p>
        <p>Remove the limb by making three cuts. The first cut should be made below the branch about four inches from the trunk. Cut to a depth of about one-third of the branch diameter. Make the second cut by sawing down from the top of the branch into the bottom cut. This will sever the branch and leave a short stub. Saw the stub off at the growth collar.</p>
        <p>Until recently, it was the standard practice to coat a pruning wound with either asphalt, paint or shellac, but today most experts feel that this practice serves no purpose. In fact, it may possibly damage the tree by sealing in moisture that could cause rot and decay.</p>
