        <p>FRIENDS say it is nearly impossible to discourage Maggie McGuire. She could read the darkest novel while rain poured outside and still not lose hope or humor.</p>
        <p>''She's so approachable and open and fun,'' said Stacey Savage Constas, a college friend. ''People love to be around her. We used to say, 'Maggie McGuire, girl on fire.' ''</p>
        <p>After graduating from Boston College, she moved to New York and eventually settled into an apartment in Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn, often chatting with neighbors or with strangers on the F train, which she rode to work each day. In her personal life, she never turned down blind dates. ''I dated all sorts of men, just the gamut, long hair, short hair, goatees, berets,'' said Ms. McGuire, now 33 and a manager for production and development of home video products for the Nickelodeon Networks in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>She had recently broken up with a boyfriend when one Monday morning in August 1996, she boarded the F train at the Carroll Gardens stop with one of her best girlfriends from college. Kurt Wallace, a graphic artist who also lived in Carroll Gardens, noticed Ms. McGuire as he boarded the train and started eavesdropping.</p>
        <p>''She was talking, and it really seemed like she was very, very happy, very energetic,'' recalled Mr. Wallace, now 43 and a computer systems analyst at Frierson Mee &amp; Kraft, a Manhattan advertising concern. ''She glowed. I won't say it was love at first sight, but it was an incredible energetic jolt.'' By the time she got off at 34th Street, he had not spoken to her but had decided she was ''the ideal vision of the person I wanted to be with.''</p>
        <p>Determined to find her again, he got up extra early the next several mornings and waited at the Carroll Gardens stop, hoping to spot her. ''For a good solid week, I was down in the subway, being crazy,'' Mr. Wallace said. That Friday after work, he boarded the F train in Midtown and was shocked when Ms. McGuire stepped onto the car a few stops later. He refers to it as ''the day she reappeared.''</p>
        <p>Unaware of him, she found a seat and dozed off. ''I jarred awake and straight ahead of me in the thick of the crowd was this guy standing by the door, looking at me,'' she recalled. ''I was trying to figure out if I knew him -- did I meet him at a party?''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile he was figuring out how to introduce himself without scaring her away. When she left the train, he followed her up the stairs and tapped her on the shoulder.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'I saw you on the subway when you got on the train with your friend,' '' Ms. McGuire remembered. ''Then he pulled out a calendar and said, 'Look!' He'd written down the time of my train in his calendar. It was charming but at the same time I was thinking, 'stalker.' ''</p>
        <p>He gave her his business card, saying he was drawn to her ''energy,'' and would love to meet for a drink sometime.</p>
        <p>An optimist about everything from flea markets to human nature (and a romantic who had always dreamed of being swept off her feet by an unexpected stranger), she called him. A few evenings later they headed to a bar. ''We just started gabbing,'' she said. ''It was the easiest thing in the world. He's very calm and consistent, and I'm rather animated. I didn't let him walk me home, though. We walked to a certain point, then I said, 'I'll take it from here.' ''</p>
        <p>They soon learned they were uncannily alike -- even their apartment decors matched. Both love mustard-colored rooms, Turkish tapestries and flea market finds. ''At first, I think it was a little scary for her how much she had in common with this stranger who lived a few blocks away,'' said Anne James-Noonan, a friend of the bride.</p>
        <p>After a Sept. 9 wedding at St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan, friends said the F train's nickname, ''the forever train,'' held new meaning. Guests discussed the subway meeting, whether it was luck, a statistical blip or something more mystical. ''They are so perfect for each other, I can't believe it was random,'' Ms. Constas said. ''There has to be something bigger going on.''</p>
