        <p>More than 10,000 angry peasants converged on the two-story, white-tiled town hall here in August, demanding relief from high taxes and administrative fees that eat up any profit from farming.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't political,'' said a young man at a bicycle repair shop here who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals. ''We're just farmers who want to survive.''</p>
        <p>According to residents, terrified town officials barricaded themselves inside the building on Aug. 17 before 30 truckloads of armed policemen arrived to disperse the crowd. At least one farmer was severely beaten in the melee, and more than a dozen others were carted away.</p>
        <p>When word of the Yuandu protest spread, thousands more angry farmers rampaged through neighboring towns in this impoverished region of south-central China's Jiangxi Province, breaking windows and even attacking the homes of some officials. Farmers say the police are still searching for leaders of the protests.</p>
        <p>Such disturbances are increasingly common across this vast agrarian country, where as many as 900 million people still depend on the land for their livelihood. The peasant class, whose dissatisfaction has driven governments from power throughout China's history, is growing restive again, swelling the ranks of the country's disaffected along with laid-off workers, struggling pensioners and the millions of Chinese who have migrated from the countryside to cities where they eke out a tenuous existence.</p>
        <p>Farmers in central Anhui Province complain that they cannot survive because of high taxes, and farmers in Shandong Province in the east report that the police beat those who refuse to pay their fees.</p>
        <p>In northern Shaanxi Province, tens of thousands of farmers are lobbying for relief, and their lawyer has been jailed for allegedly inciting the peasantry to revolt.</p>
        <p>Despite Marxism's promise of abolishing class distinctions, the old feudal pattern is back in force, this time with local Communist Party bosses playing the role of oppressor.</p>
        <p>Beijing hopes to stop the scattered unrest before it spreads into something more threatening by raising farm incomes, cutting local government bureaucracies and reforming the tax system.</p>
        <p>But the most fundamental cause of the problem cuts to the heart of the country's sacred one-party rule: The farmers have no political power.</p>
        <p>Despite publicity about village council elections, local party officials wield the real power, and they are still appointed from above rather than elected from below.</p>
        <p>''It's the cadre system,'' said Yu Hong, a Shanghai-based sociologist who has spent her career studying the plight of China's farmers. ''They say the cadres are selected by vote, but they are actually selected by higher officials and are evaluated according to what they achieve.''</p>
        <p>And because the most important achievements are those their superiors can see, local officials tend to build as much as possible with money raised from the peasants.</p>
        <p>Like imperial tax collectors of old, they charge fees for every building standing, every pig slaughtered and every child who goes to school.</p>
        <p>Much of that money ends up in the pockets of local officials' families  and friends, or is otherwise spent on supporting the cadres, or party officials, whose power rests in part on being able to show off the trappings that come with it.</p>
        <p>A result is growing resentment among the peasants who were once the party's strongest supporters.</p>
        <p>This region gave its sons to the Communists 70 years ago, when Mao Zedong founded the Aug. 1 Army in nearby Nanchang.</p>
        <p>And promises to emancipate the peasants from high taxes and rents helped sweep the Communists to power in 1949. Droves of former tax collectors and landowners were executed after the Communist victory.</p>
        <p>But the peasants were never given direct ownership of the land. And like other rulers before them, the Communists depend for funds on increasingly heavy levies exacted from people like Qiu Mingbao.</p>
        <p>Mr. Qiu's ancestors have farmed here for centuries, but his family still owns little more than a buffalo, a building and a few farm tools. The seat of his pants is marked by patches, and his sandals are made from inner tubes and twisted-straw twine.</p>
        <p>A question about taxes erased 63-year-old Mr. Qiu's crooked smile, lopsided because dentistry on his rung of the economic ladder is about taking teeth out, not keeping them in.</p>
        <p>''No one wants to work the land anymore,'' he shouted, gesticulating wildly over an unplanted rice paddy not far from Yuandu. ''We can't make any money from the land,'' he complained, saying that what's left after various taxes and fees is not enough to feed his family.</p>
        <p>Mao abolished private property and grouped the peasants into communes. Deng Xiaoping later converted the communes into townships and allowed the peasants to sign long-term leases on plots of land.</p>
        <p>But ownership of the land remained in the hands of the state. And without the communes' collective income to pay for roads and schools, local governments began levying fees directly on the farmers in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>It worked at first. City folk watched jealously while peasant incomes rose as farmers sold excess produce on the country's new ''free markets.'' Two-story concrete houses sprouted in villages across the country, replacing single-story mud-brick homes.</p>
        <p>But as the peasants grew richer, so did the bureaucracy. In Qipan township, a former commune in Hebei Province in central China, the number of officials tripled over the last decade to 340, according to Li Changping, the town's party secretary.</p>
        <p>''When will the ranks of cadres stop swelling? How can the farmers stand it?'' he wrote in an emotional appeal to China's cabinet, the State Council. His letter was published in Southern Weekend, a progressive party-controlled newspaper.</p>
        <p>Imported foreign produce will squeeze Chinese farmers yet further when China joins the World Trade Organization. Even now, some subsidize their family plots with money earned working in factories and on construction sites. Mr. Li said about 80 percent of the farmers who remain in his town were losing money.</p>
        <p>With financial burdens growing and the price of grain and other agricultural products falling, millions of farmers are abandoning their fields. About 233,450 acres of land has been abandoned in Qipan alone this year, or about 65 percent of the town's total, Mr. Li said. While the town government is trying to subcontract the land to other farmers, he said that at least 133,400 acres would remain unplanted this year.</p>
        <p>Under the long-term contracts that farmers signed when the communes were dismantled in the late 1970's, many of which were renewed in the last two years, farmers remain liable for taxes even if they leave the land behind. Many continue farming simply to defray the taxes due, even though their crops fail to cover expenses.</p>
        <p>In Feixi, a village in Anhui province, Liu Guangyue says the combined taxes and fees on his farmland are about equal to the amount he can earn from grain. The money for seed and fertilizer he earns in construction. And though his rice crop failed this year because of a drought, local government still insists he pay the levies.</p>
        <p>Near his land, farmers line the road to Anhui's provincial capital, Hefei, trying to hop onto passing trucks filled with sand. They race, some in bare feet, to climb onto the trucks so they can earn 8 yuan, about 90 cents, unloading the sand at a construction site in the city. If more than one man clambers aboard, they share the pay.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is that China has far more farmers than it needs. More than 400 million people actively work the land, but Ms. Yu, the sociologist, estimates that China needs only about 250 million farmers to feed the country. With the land divided among so many people, farmers lack the economies of scale that would make them competitive by world standards. Their production costs actually exceed those of farmers in industrialized countries.</p>
        <p>Adding to the farmers' woes, China's state granaries are already filled to capacity from three years of bumper harvests. The state buys some grain at subsidized prices, but cannot afford to buy all that farmers want to sell.</p>
        <p>Farmers in remote areas often cannot sell their grain at all.</p>
        <p>This year's harvest is expected to be much slimmer thanks to a severe  drought. And the central government is urging China's state grain bureaus to raise their purchasing price by 10 percent, accordingly.</p>
        <p>But with the country already sitting on huge surpluses, it is unlikely that local grain bureaus will be willing to pay more for grain they don't need.</p>
        <p>The government is also tinkering with tax reforms that would recentralize tax collection and require local governments to live off subsidies from the state, rather than levy taxes on farmers and local industry. A pilot project in Anhui has replaced local government fees with a single agricultural tax, for example. But local governments are resisting the plan, which will deprive them of revenues free from the scrutiny of the  central government.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Zhu Rongji has vowed to cut the number of township officials by 70 percent as part of an overall effort to shrink China's bloated bureaucracy. But this would probably take years, if it happens at all.</p>
        <p>So severe is the crisis that Deputy Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, the senior government official responsible for agriculture, held a national teleconference with provincial leaders to help placate the peasantry.</p>
        <p>With his live image projected on screens in conference rooms across the country, Mr. Wen told regional officials that the crisis is the biggest challenge to face Chinese agriculture since the break up of the communes 20 years ago. He said money raised from farmers should not surpass the officially budgeted levels of 1997 or exceed 5 percent of the total farm incomes in any province.</p>
        <p>But that is difficult to enforce in a place like Yuandu, where about 1,000 officials live off the fees collected from the town's 4,000 farmers. The income gap between the two is evident from a lone Nissan S.U.V. parked on the road where occasional horse-drawn carts pull loads of green and purple beans to market past mounds of smoldering rice husks.</p>
        <p>A handwritten poster on a public notice board only hints at the growing tensions. ''To Our Farmer Friends,'' the poster begins, urging restraint among the rural population. The poster promises that ''unreasonable'' fees will be abolished, and local farmers say this year's school fees have already been cut to 70 yuan per student from the 260 yuan charged last year.</p>
        <p>Another poster on the notice board calls for vigilance against agitators, asking that people report to the police anyone who is planning further demonstrations.</p>
