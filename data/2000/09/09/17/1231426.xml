        <p>TIGER WOODS is not just the world's best golfer; he's also the world's best conglomerate.</p>
        <p>Even before his new five-year, $85 million Nike contract that will more than double his current five-year, $40 million Nike deal, which expires next September, his 11 endorsement contracts were 2 more than his 9 tournament victories this year.</p>
        <p>If you add up those 11 contracts that his International Management Group gurus have negotiated, his endorsement income this year will surpass $50 million, plus at least $12 million this year in worldwide prize money and appearance fees.</p>
        <p>His endorsement total of more than $50 million will be significantly more than Michael Jordan's reported endorsement high of $35 million a year when he was soaring through National Basketball Association arenas.</p>
        <p>And for all the millions that those 11 companies are paying the 24-year-old Woods as their ambassador, he's a bargain. He's now what Pele, Muhammad Ali and Jordan were in other years -- the most recognizable sports figure on the planet. And when it's time to renegotiate the contracts, all those companies will find, as Nike did, that he'll be more expensive next time. Much more expensive.</p>
        <p>In addition to his Nike deal, he has contracts with American Express, Buick, Wheaties, Rolex, Titleist golf equipment, Golf Digest magazine, Electronic Arts video games, TLC Laser Eye Centers, CBS SportsLine and Asahi coffee in Japan.</p>
        <p>In a way, those 11 contracts represent a career grand slam in endorsements that matches the career Grand Slam in golf that he completed this year by adding the United States Open and the British Open to his 1997 Masters and 1999 Professional Golfers Association victory while winning seven other tournaments, including a second P.G.A. title.</p>
        <p>But there's a controversial connection to his contracts with Nike and Titleist that developed from the Nike commercial in which he keeps bouncing a golf ball on a club, then hits the ball with the club as if with a fungo bat.</p>
        <p>That commercial developed accidentally during the shooting of another Nike commercial when Woods, between takes, was noticed bouncing a golf ball on a club just for the fun of it. With the cameras rolling, Woods did it on the fourth take.</p>
        <p>At the time, Titleist, which was paying Woods to play and endorse its golf ball and clubs, objected because the commercial made it appear that he was using a Nike ball. In his renegotiated Titleist contract, he is still being paid to use their clubs, but Titleist is not allowed to use his name or likeness in its advertising.</p>
        <p>Nike, meanwhile, was developing the golf ball that Woods has used since May -- the ball with a reported harder inner core than that in the Nike ball being sold in golf shops, the ball that he hits so far that some people were wondering if maybe it was a ''hot'' ball.</p>
        <p>''It's a legal ball,'' said Dick Rugge, the senior technical director at the United States Golf Association in Far Hills, N.J., where clubs and balls are subjected to tests for distance, initial velocity, diameter, weight and symmetry. ''Nike submitted 14 different versions of that ball to us last December. The one that Tiger liked and uses, other pros tried that particular ball too, but chose not to use it.''</p>
        <p>All golf balls may look identical, but they vary with the hardness of the material, the thickness of the cover, the size of the core.</p>
        <p>''Tiger isn't winning all these tournaments because of that Nike ball,'' Rugge said. ''He's winning because he's a different breed of cat.''</p>
        <p>Until another golfer rises to that different cat's level, about the only threat to Woods is Woods himself. He's so skilled and so strong, he doesn't hesitate to hit a ball from a lie that could be hazardous to his health, especially the health of his hands and wrists. He's hit the ball off small rocks. He's hit the ball from so close behind a tree, his follow-through jammed the clubhead into the trunk. At the Buick Open the week before the recent P.G.A. Championship, he hit a ball off a tree root and winced from the pain in his hand and wrist.</p>
        <p>''It was just a stinger,'' he said later. ''I hit the root and it hurt quite a bit initially, then as I was walking to my ball, it all went away. But I took out that root pretty good.''</p>
        <p>If he persists in risking his hands and wrist, sooner or later a root or a rock is going to be stronger than even Tiger Woods is. Sooner or later, a root or a rock could take him out pretty good, too; out of the PGA Tour until that injury heals. That could disrupt the dominance of both the world's best golfer and the world's best conglomerate.</p>
