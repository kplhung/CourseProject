        <p>PSYCHOLOGISTS call it projection -- attributing to others the behavior that we refuse to recognize in ourselves. And the practice is widespread on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Consider the longstanding concern on Wall Street that naive investors will be quick to dump their stocks during market corrections, thereby exaggerating declines and increasing the probability of a crash.</p>
        <p>New research by two finance professors, Patrick J. Dennis of the University of Virginia and Deon Strickland of Ohio State University, shows that a far bigger worry is the behavior of Wall Street's institutional investors -- defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as those who manage more than $100 million.</p>
        <p>Before the study -- called ''Who Blinks in Volatile Markets, Individuals or Institutions?'' -- the connection between institutional investors and market volatility was hidden. Because the S.E.C. requires such investors to report their holdings only quarterly, it is difficult to know how these large investors were behaving during short periods of volatility. But the two professors devised an ingenious solution: they focused instead on the percentage of each stock's shares owned by institutional investors.</p>
        <p>That focus let them test Wall Street's stereotype of the individual investor as fickle and erratic, vulnerable to whichever way the wind is blowing. If, in fact, individual investors are more likely than institutional investors to dump stocks during a correction, then the stocks with the lowest levels of institutional ownership will fall the most.</p>
        <p>But the reality was just the opposite.</p>
        <p>The professors studied all the trading days from 1988 to 1996 on which the stock market dropped more than 2 percent. The stocks that fell the most were those most owned by institutions. Conversely, the stocks that fell the least were those with the lowest levels of such ownership. The results of the study can be found at http://gates .comm.virginia.edu/pjd9v/research.htm.</p>
        <p>So what leads Wall Street's largest investors into behavior that they are so ready to criticize in others? I think the answer lies in the odd incentive system under which they operate -- they constantly feel obliged to do things that they believe will reduce their long-term performance.</p>
        <p>Institutional investors are much more afraid of being alone at the bottom of the rankings than they are eager to be at the top. After all, a dead-last finish could well result in firing. Running somewhere in the pack -- even if lagging behind the market -- is unlikely to draw much attention.</p>
        <p>That, of course, means herdlike behavior, even when it is foolish. An institutional investor who makes a bad decision needn't worry much about his reputation if others make that decision, too. So these investors will sell into market declines, even when they think the stocks they are selling are undervalued. They reason that the decline might be the start of something worse, and though they may think that unlikely, they cannot afford to be both alone and wrong.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, these perverse incentives create opportunities for the rest of us. How we exploit them depends on our risk tolerance.</p>
        <p>If you want to avoid the most volatile stocks, you might seek stocks with the lowest levels of institutional ownership. (You can learn how much of a company's stock is owned by institutions through Web sites like Yahoo's.) To whittle down the universe, you might first look for companies with less than 20 percent of their shares in institutional hands; that eliminates about half of all stocks, according to the professors. To draw an even deeper line in the sand, focus only on stocks with less than 10 percent institutional ownership. That knocks out an additional quarter of the market.</p>
        <p>If you are an aggressive investor, however, you can view institutionally dominated stocks as trading vehicles. If you are bearish on the overall market, for example, your list of short-sale candidates should include such stocks. For a stock to be among the quarter of the market that is most dominated by institutions, according to Professor Dennis, they must own more than around 40 percent of it.</p>
