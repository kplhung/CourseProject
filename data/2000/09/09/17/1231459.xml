        <p>The Pittsburgh Panthers are 3-0 in nonconference games, impressive as they approach their Big East schedule.

        <p>The Pittsburgh Panthers are 3-0 in nonconference games, impressive as they approach their Big East schedule. ''Our football team exorcised a lot of demons today,'' Coach Walt Harris said after a 12-0 victory over Penn State at Three Rivers Stadium, which was full and giddy. ''A sleeping giant is starting to wake up again. We're thrilled.''</p>
        <p>One of many impressive Panthers was Rod Rutherford, a freshman who ran slippery option plays as a backup quarterback and who scored a touchdown on a 62-yard play when he lined up as a receiver.</p>
        <p>''I can do a lot of things,'' said Rutherford, who ran 6 times for 32 yards. Referring to Penn State defenders, he said: ''I think they knew what they were about to get. It's just: How are you going to stop it?''</p>
        <p>But most postgame conversations outside of Western Pennsylvania will be about the losing team, the Nittany Lions of Joe Paterno. Almost always a national power, Paterno's team fell to 1-3 as it begins its eight-game Big Ten schedule. The Lions have lost six of their last seven regular-season games.</p>
        <p>Their starting quarterback, Rashard Casey, could not move the offense consistently (the Lions had 225 yards). Their defense allowed too many Panthers to break too many tackles. And the Lions hurt themselves with penalties.</p>
        <p>Paterno began this 35th season as head coach needing seven victories to break Bear Bryant's career record for Division I-A coaches of 323 victories. With eight games remaining, Paterno still needs five to tie Bryant and six to surpass him.</p>
        <p>''When bad things happen to this team, they don't seem to know how to pick it up,'' Paterno said. ''I've got to sit back when things are as bad as they are. I've got to start looking at myself and see if I've given these kids the best opportunity to win. Maybe I've got better players who aren't playing.''</p>
        <p>One player he may re-evaluate is Casey, who has been charged with assaulting an off-duty police officer in Hoboken, N.J., last May. Casey completed 17 of 34 passes for 159 yards and an interception. Paterno replaced him with Matt Senneca for one series of downs.</p>
        <p>''I think Casey's looking over his shoulder,'' Paterno said. ''There's no question we need some leadership. I've got to find out if Casey is the one who can bring us back.''</p>
        <p>Casey seemed baffled by events and by his coach. ''I'm just as confused as everyone else,'' Casey said. ''I don't understand it.''</p>
        <p>Rutherford's game-breaking play, on a short pass from quarterback John Turman, came early in the third quarter when Pitt had a 3-0 lead. He caught the ball on the Panther logo at midfield, then ran to the left sideline before cutting back diagonally to the right and sprinting. He improvised the route before he caught the ball, his coach said.</p>
        <p>For an early-season matchup, there was a sense of finality about this game.</p>
        <p>Although it was the 96th meeting between the schools, no more have been scheduled. Penn State had won the previous seven games, including last year's by 20-17, and holds a 50-42-4 lead in the series, which began in 1893.</p>
        <p>And it was the last time they will meet at the 30-year-old Three Rivers Stadium, which is scheduled to be torn down after this season.</p>
        <p>Pitt defensive end Bryan Knight said players had much to talk about.</p>
        <p>''There wasn't much respect out there, I've got to be honest with you,'' Knight said. ''There was a lot of trash-talking and some extra cheap shots. That's what makes football fun sometimes.''</p>
