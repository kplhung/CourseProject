        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>New legislation easing land-use rules for religious groups [''God, Caesar and Zoning,'' Aug. 27] also alarms residential homeowners and civic groups. The concern was best voiced by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani: ''Facilities built and developed by religious institutions can produce the same kind of noise, traffic, visual and other impacts common to other uses which affect the quality of life.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>New legislation easing land-use rules for religious groups [''God, Caesar and Zoning,'' Aug. 27] also alarms residential homeowners and civic groups. The concern was best voiced by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani: ''Facilities built and developed by religious institutions can produce the same kind of noise, traffic, visual and other impacts common to other uses which affect the quality of life.''</p>
        <p>Federal legislation is designed to ensure constitutional protection for religious liberty. At the same time, local land-use laws are necessarily enacted to enhance public safety and long-term neighborhood stability. These laws are not written to restrict religious exercise. Developers of religious facilities who claim such restriction are, at best, confusing the issue and, at worst, fomenting divisiveness.</p>
        <p>For the sake and integrity of residential neighborhoods, public officials responsible for enacting, amending and enforcing land-use laws must not let the discussion become obscured with issues not directly relevant to land use.</p>
        <p>JOHN C. LIU  President  North Flushing Civic Association</p>
