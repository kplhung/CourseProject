        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A Sept. 10 Week in Review article reports that companies are ''abandoning H.M.O.'s for preferred provider organizations -- doctor networks that agree to reduced rates for their services.'' It also quotes Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, as saying, ''Don't be surprised if this bubble pops, too.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A Sept. 10 Week in Review article reports that companies are ''abandoning H.M.O.'s for preferred provider organizations -- doctor networks that agree to reduced rates for their services.'' It also quotes Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, as saying, ''Don't be surprised if this bubble pops, too.''</p>
        <p>I expect that this bubble will burst and believe there are no cures for health care's ills on the horizon. In 30 years as an internist, I have never seen the morale of my fellow doctors as low as it is today.</p>
        <p>Because of heavily discounted payments from managed care companies or plans, doctors must see a large number of patients to stay afloat financially. They must also work at a speed that makes it difficult to care for those patients.</p>
