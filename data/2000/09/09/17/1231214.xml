        <p>The State Police may not have plans to turn out a crop of  Dudley Do-Rights, but the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have been called in to develop training that has begun at the State Police Training Academy in Sea Girt. Members of the mounted police, noted for their training methods, were in New Jersey this summer to instruct academy teachers. Class sizes were reduced from more than 100 to 30 and  training was extended from 21 to 26 weeks.</p>
