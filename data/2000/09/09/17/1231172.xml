        <p>Photo essay on high-end furniture conservator Dean Squires of West Caldwell, NJ, whose work is prominently featured in Newark Museum (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>ALTHOUGH he is not a painter or sculptor, Dean Squires is an artist whose work is prominently featured in the Newark Museum. Mr. Squires, 48, is one of the few high-end furniture conservators in the state, and the one the museum's decorative arts curator, Ulysses Dietz, trusts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Squires, a former history major and rock 'n' roll musician from Boston, became interested in furniture restoration in 1978, when he began apprenticing with an antiques dealer and furniture restorer. ''I always liked things that had a lot of age to them,'' said Mr. Squires (plaid shirt), whose studio is in West Caldwell.</p>
        <p>His first jobs were in ''dip and strip'' companies -- furniture refinishing factories that he called ''the lowest job on the furniture-world totem pole.''</p>
        <p>The first important piece he worked on was a 230-year-old walnut desk with floral marquetry. ''I was scared to death,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some of the furniture Mr. Squires restores needs to reflect its history through the wear of the furniture. ''As much of the original surface should show as possible,'' he said. But he is also asked to make old furniture look new.</p>
        <p>Many historical groups run on small budgets, and Mr. Squires sometimes offers a break. In the case of Newark Museum, much of what needs to be restored remains in storage awaiting money.</p>
        <p>''Dean is a sensitive and thoughtful conservator,'' said Mr. Dietz (tan vest), for whom Mr. Squires restored items ranging from an 18th-century lowboy to a 1949 Motorola television cabinet. ''He brings an understanding of how they were made originally and how he can make them look their best without altering them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Squires said: ''Most of the work is about stepping back and trying to figure out what's in front of you. There's lots of layers. It's not brain surgery, but you can wreck it real easily.''</p>
