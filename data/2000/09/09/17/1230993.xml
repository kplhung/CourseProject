        <p>Ghostwritten</p>
        <p>By David Mitchell.</p>
        <p>426 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Random House. $24.95.</p>
        <p>Like Owen Glendower, David Mitchell calls up supernatural spirits; like Glendower's, they fail to come. ''Ghostwritten,'' which is billed as a novel, consists of 10 separate tales linked by supernaturals and a clutch of coincidence. Mitchell's spirit-summoning seeks to assert unity, but the best segments are true gems in a ponderously worked necklace. For the most part, they would do better unstrung.</p>
        <p>''Ghostwritten'' sights its stories through an eschatological eye, as if gods and ghosts were observing present-day humanity and contending over what should be done with it. Nothing good, it seems. In ''Night Train,'' one of the later segments, a worn-down deity, exhausted in the effort to keep civilization from self-destruction (it calls itself Zookeeper, and its charges are plainly out of control), breaks into an all-night radio talk show to ask advice.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere an itchy angel/demon, at once nasty-minded and high-minded, hops through the stories like a transcendental flea, jumping the characters at climactic moments and twitching them off course. Itchy (Mitchell won't give it a name) has no corporeal existence of its own; instead, it skids from host to host. In ''Mongolia,'' the weakest and gassiest segment, it pursues its person-to-person wanderings in search of a shamanic identity suggested by a series of pretentious parables. In other stories it is variously a child-spirit that prevents a wife from conceiving, the familiar of a brilliant woman physicist, a tree ghost guiding an old Chinese tea seller through a difficult life and an unwelcome would-be collaborator with God the Zookeeper.</p>
        <p>Mitchell's supernatural jiggling makes too much of stories that are able to make quite a bit of themselves without it. ''Okinawa,'' the first, is a mournful and comic fictional portrait of a member of the Aum Shinrikyo sect who fled Japan after detonating nerve gas in a Tokyo subway.</p>
        <p>Quasar, as he calls himself, wanders about like a Martian waiting for signals from the mother ship. He is pitifully alone, scorning the friendly Okinawans as ''unclean.'' Purity lies only in his own doomsday sect. A comet is approaching that will kill all but the elect and their master, Serendipity. Word comes of arrests back home: Quasar interrogates spiders as possible Serendipity messengers; also a dog who counsels him to eat eggs and orange Popsicles (for vitamin C).</p>
        <p>Quasar appears later as a caller on ''Night Train,'' and again in the last segment: a description of his panicky struggle to get out of the crowded subway before his bomb goes off. In ''Tokyo,'' he pops up for a second or two as the voice of a phone caller who has misdialed. Otherwise, this is a charming story about Satoru, a misfit boy, half-Japanese, half-Filipino, whose passion for jazz gets him a spot in an amateur band and a job in a music store.</p>
        <p>The people of Tokyo, Satoru reflects, are so jammed together that their only freedom is inward: calisthenics, TV, the Internet, jazz or (another Quasar link) doomsday cults. Mitchell sweetly renders Satoru's voice as he recounts his life in terms of the great jazz singers and his romance with Tomoyo, a Chinese-Japanese girl from Hong Kong whose wealthy father gets him a job there.</p>
        <p>The lovers flash through briefly as a symbol of innocence in ''Hong Kong,'' a taut, brilliantly layered story about a doomed British currency trader. Young and after a fortune, Neal becomes the scapegoat in a money-laundering scheme devised by his boss in London. The beneficiary is a member of the Russian mafia who appears later in ''Petersburg,'' a jokily cheesy noir about art forgery and theft.</p>
        <p>Deftly chaotic, ''Hong Kong'' tells of a man rent by centrifugal pressures that cost him his wife -- Itchy appears as a ghost child who prevents her from conceiving -- and, after a fugue-like breakdown, his life. There could be no more grimly comic account of a mortally stressed morning: hangover, panicky rush, anguish over wife, guilt over sex with a predatory maid, fear of arrest, incinerated breakfast, coffee flooding the floor from a carelessly doubled filter.</p>
        <p>A doubled filter also figures in ''London,'' one of the best and least ghost-ridden segments. It spews coffee in the kitchen of an elderly gay couple distantly connected to the Petersburg story. They are one stop along a minor Bloomsday-like ramble taken through London by Marco, an aimless rock-band player and writer.</p>
        <p>Aimless and a man of touching good will, as we see in a series of difficult adventures with a curiously peaceful ending. The stops include lovemaking with Neal's estranged wife, large malt whiskeys with a stereotypically sybaritic British publisher (why can't American publishers have as much fun?) and helping a woman hit by a cab.</p>
        <p>She turns out to be Mo, the protagonist of ''Clear Island,'' a sinfully extravagant thriller with a rickety, enjoyable ending. Mo is a genius physicist who has fled a top-secret project after learning that her findings are being used for military rocketry. Pursued by NATO and Pentagon agents, she travels clandestinely around the world; her journey includes a stay with a Hong Kong friend who happens to be a financial sleuth on Neal's trail, and a trip on the Trans-Siberian Railroad, where she meets Itchy, residing for the moment in a Danish tourist.</p>
        <p>Itchy, fortunately, plays no real part at this point. Instead, ''Clear Island'' tells of Mo sneaking back to her beloved farm in the Aran Islands to rejoin her blind poet husband, her son and her neighbors. They try to protect her when the agents arrive to seize her Einstein-sized discovery, jotted down in a notebook on the round-the-world flight. It involves ''quantum cognition'' or -- here come the spirits again -- a scientific way of reaching God. What God, or Zookeeper, does about it we discover on the ''Night Train'' talk show.</p>
        <p>Links everywhere; some agreeably pointless, others -- particularly the ghostly ones -- an insistent jostle. Perhaps they reflect a doubt about the power of story itself -- akin to a postmodern cuisine that distrusts the witchery of ingredients and drowns out dinner with baroque seasonings and fancy plates. Thomas Aquinas cautioned against resorting to supernatural proofs when natural ones could be found. Mitchell, an Englishman living in Japan, has a gift for fiction's natural pleasures -- intricate surprises, insidiously woven narratives, ingenious voices -- but he seems unsure that they can find the way on their own.</p>
