        <p>Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton clashed yesterday over the use of so-called soft-money contributions in their campaigns, even as the state Conservative Party prepared to broadcast a new commercial today, financed with soft money, that for the first time attacks Mrs. Clinton's failed attempt to create a national health care system.</p>
        <p>Against a backdrop of buzzes and cartoon music, the ad shows someone playing the children's game Operation as an announcer belittles Mrs. Clinton's most high-profile venture into public policy: her effort in 1994 to persuade Congress to adopt the health care proposal President Clinton advocated when he ran for president. The commercial asserts that if it had been adopted by Congress, the plan would have led to cuts in medical care and less consumer choice, and it recalls Mrs. Clinton's attempt to draft the plan in secret.</p>
        <p>''She worked in secret and had to be sued to disclose the details,'' the announcer says sarcastically. ''So if you trust Hillary Clinton, maybe you should see your doctor. While you still can.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio is running for Senate as the candidate of the Republican Party and the Conservative Party. Michael P. Long, the chairman of the Conservative Party, said he got the idea for the ad from watching Tim Russert, the host of NBC's ''Meet The Press,'' aggressively question Mrs. Clinton on her 1994 health care proposal at the two candidates' debate in Buffalo on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Long and Michael Marr, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio's campaign, both said yesterday that the Conservative Party did not coordinate the ad with Mr. Lazio, and Mr. Marr said he first learned of the commercial from a reporter. Nonetheless, the ad previews a line of attack that Mr. Lazio have been planning to use against Mrs. Clinton over the next few weeks.</p>
        <p>The Lazio campaign has been preparing a choreographed line of attacks, focusing almost day to day on different facets of the 1994 Clinton health care plan, and how they might have affected New York -- for example, by cutting reimbursements to teaching hospitals. One of Mr. Lazio's aides said the candidate would seek to use the plan to paint Mrs. Clinton as an advocate of large government, as well as to raise questions about her competence and credibility.</p>
        <p>Nelson Warfield, the political consultant who made the ad for the Conservative Party, said yesterday that health care ''is a real vulnerability for her.</p>
        <p>''On health care,'' he said, ''Hillary Clinton has proved that neither her judgment nor her candor can be trusted.''</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Mr. Lazio has repeatedly assailed Mrs. Clinton as untrustworthy. The advertisement echoes that line of attack, with the word ''trusted'' appearing on the screen, underlined, as the announcer proclaims it.</p>
        <p>The advertisement is being financed with soft money, or largely unlimited campaign contributions to party organizations, that can be used for party building but not advocacy of a particular candidate. The ad was released after a week in which Mr. Lazio has been attacking Mrs. Clinton for collecting such funds to finance her own campaign.</p>
        <p>At the debate on Wednesday, Mr. Lazio demanded that Mrs. Clinton sign a pledge promising to renounce the use of soft money. Mrs. Clinton, who has been vigorously raising soft money to finance her campaign, said she would sign it only if Mr. Lazio persuaded political committees and outside groups that have been running ads attacking her to agree in writing to stay out of the race.</p>
        <p>That the Conservative Party, which is one of Mr. Lazio's main promoters in the state, is using soft-money advertisements on his behalf -- and on a day that Mr. Lazio attacked Mrs. Clinton again for the practice -- is the latest evidence,  many analysts say, that neither side has any genuine interest in changing its campaign finance practices, and that both are using the issue for political advantage.</p>
        <p>''Can I ask you a question?'' said Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, when called for comment on the Conservative ad. ''Is this a soft money ad?'' Told that it was, he laughed and said: ''Wow.''</p>
        <p>''This is just another example of Mr. Lazio's soft-money hypocrisy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As to the charges in the ad, Mr. Wolfson described them as ''patently false and soft-money fakery.'' He said that Mrs. Clinton's commitment to expanding health care was well established.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Lazio's campaign, Mr. Marr said there was no inconsistency between what Mr. Lazio was saying and doing. ''Mrs. Clinton and her own campaign have only raised the issue of advertising done on this campaign's behalf -- and ignored the fact that Mrs. Clinton's left-wing allies have aired TV commercials on her behalf,'' he said. ''Her hypocrisy is stunning.''</p>
        <p>The exchanges came as both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio squabbled over the issue as they campaigned through Westchester. Mr. Lazio also campaigned in Manhattan, where he marched in the German-American Steuben Day Parade up Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said that if Mrs. Clinton signed his form, he would call on outside groups to stop spending money on his behalf, ''and if anybody was to resist our call, I am prepared to repudiate them.</p>
        <p>In Chappaqua, Mrs. Clinton, who had flown in from Washington to attend a fair in her new hometown, described Mr. Lazio's demand as a  ''a stunt'' and attacked his credibility on the question of soft money.</p>
