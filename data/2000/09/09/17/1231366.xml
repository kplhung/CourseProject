        <p>I'm sure all of us that had the fortune of knowing Peter Chow are thankful you wrote about what a wonderful person he was. The saddest part is that many of us did not know that he suffered from asthma. He always had a kind word for his customers and would never mention his troubles.</p>

        <p>As an asthma sufferer myself, I was particularly saddened because perhaps his death could have been prevented. If only the Chows did  have health insurance and if only all of us that knew and appreciated him as a special person in our daily routines had known about his illness. We would have been able to help.</p>
