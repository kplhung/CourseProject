        <p>In Robert Altman's new movie,  ''Dr. T and the Women,'' which opens Oct. 6, Richard Gere plays Dr. T, a Dallas gynecologist whose women (family and patients) are so merrily overdressed that one patient lies on the examining table for a Pap test still in her pheasant-feather hat. The look in the film seems like a timely sendup of the ladylike styles that are the rage this fall. The women, played by Laura Dern, Janine Turner and Tara Reid, among others, wear suits -- but in red stamped leather and leopard print or edged in zebra. They wrap their necks with cascades of fox tails and blow-in-the-wind curly lamb boas, and their heads in saucer-shaped hats trimmed with iridescent coq feathers. They carry gloves.</p>

        <p>In Robert Altman's new movie,  ''Dr. T and the Women,'' which opens Oct. 6, Richard Gere plays Dr. T, a Dallas gynecologist whose women (family and patients) are so merrily overdressed that one patient lies on the examining table for a Pap test still in her pheasant-feather hat.

        <p>''By having the animal patterns, it gave some of the characters a soft predatory feeling,'' said Dona Granata, the film's costume designer. ''The male of the animal kingdom always gets to be the showoff, but in Texas, the women show off.'' Ms. Granata smothered the film's characters in labels like Gucci, Dior and Escada. ''Minimalism,'' she said, ''is not in order.''</p>
        <p>So when Farrah Fawcett, as Dr. T's wife, has a nervous breakdown, it seems logical that she asks for attention by dancing in a mall water fountain and taking off all her clothes.</p>
