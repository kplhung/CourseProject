        <p>In the unsettling early stages of the competition, America's tattooed star Blaine Wilson had morphed into an invisible-ink creation while a disastrous floor exercise by the team had left its spirits frayed.</p>
        <p>On the verge of an Olympic collapse in the men's preliminaries tonight, the United States gymnastics team needed someone to point it in the right direction. The crooked index finger of John Roethlisberger was good enough. During a warm-up before the pommel horse event, Roethlisberger whacked his right hand, leaving his finger shaped like a hook.</p>
        <p>Inside the still air of the Super Dome, Roethlisberger was overheard calling out to team trainer, Rigo Carbajal. In an instant, Carbajal yanked the gymnast's finger back into place, and Roethlisberger was ready to compete. Ignoring the pain, he worked his way around the pommel horse and punctuated his performance with a 360-degree turn on a handstand, spinning like a helicopter blade as he launched into a flawless dismount.</p>
        <p>''When I saw John's finger, I thought it was over,'' said United States Coach Peter Kormann. ''I've never seen anything like this in 25 years of coaching.''</p>
        <p>Roethlisberger scored a motivational 9.6 on the pommel horse. At that moment, a team that was teetering at seventh place began working its way up through the standings. By the end of the night, the United States had finished a surprising fourth, and was safely among the top six to qualify for Monday's team medal competition.</p>
        <p>With Roethlisberger's act of inspiration, Kormann's strategy behind assembling the United States team began to unfold. At the Olympic trials a month ago, the 30-year-old Roethlisberger and 17-year-old Morgan Hamm finished behind the fifth-place Jamie Natalie.</p>
        <p>In a controversial move, Kormann selected the veteran over Natalie because of his power to motivate, a decision not even Roethlisberger's coach and father, Fred, understood at the time. Kormann placed Hamm on the six-man team, as well, trusting that the freckled-faced redhead had the potential to reach the same elite level as his twin, Paul.</p>
        <p>Tonight, both decisions proved clairvoyant. Although no one could have foreseen the trouble the team's marquee pinup, Wilson, would endure, Kormann was right to rely on the calm Hamm brothers. Emerging as a phenom tonight, Paul Hamm finished sixth over all, easily among the top 36 individuals to qualify for the all-around competition later this week.</p>
        <p>''You became a man tonight,'' Roethlisberger yelled to Hamm as he passed him in a hallway after the meet.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Morgan Hamm grew up, too. He provided a safety net for Wilson's problems. At the end of apparatus event, teams are allowed to drop the lowest score of the five posted. Twice, Wilson had the low score for the team. ''It was a bad, bad meet for me,'' said Wilson, a five-time national champion. ''I can't explain it.''</p>
        <p>The bewildered Wilson came up with enough strong scores to finish 10th over all in the individual scoring, while Stephen McCain squeezed into the all-around medal competition at No. 36. But the young, untested Hamm twins were the talk of the team.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen two 17-year-old guys exhibit the kind of calm the twins from Wisconsin did,'' Wilson said. ''Must be the cheese.''</p>
        <p>Or warm milk. Soothing with their presence, the Hamm twins simply followed Roethlisberger's lead tonight.</p>
        <p>''I had to keep my head together,'' Roethlisberger said. ''I didn't know what my finger was going to feel like on the horse. I couldn't wait and see. I just had to be aggressive.''</p>
        <p>Just after Roethlisberger flaunted his pain threshold on the second apparatus of the night, the pommel horse, Paul Hamm followed that up with a 9.7 on the vault. But there was still a potential minefield ahead. With his finger swelling by the minute, Roethlisberger could only do so much. Without a firm grip, he could not compete on the parallel bars. That's where Morgan Hamm stepped in as a last-minute substitute. Instead of buckling under the pressure, Hamm posted a respectable 9.475, a score the team kept after Wilson bobbled his way to a 9.312.</p>
        <p>''I think the momentum turned when John was on the horse, and then when Paul stuck that vault,'' McCain said. ''Everyone got caught up in it.''</p>
        <p>That's what Roethlisberger does for a team. He lifts those around him. As the resident three-time Olympian, Roethlisberger is known for motivational speeches that move his teammates to tears. Tonight, he gave them spiritual guidance with a dislocated finger.</p>
        <p>''This just goes to show that what that guy talks about is real,'' McCain said. ''He has this never-give-up attitude. He talks about that all the time. When he did what he did on the horse, it's like, whoa. You know that everything he says, it's for real.''</p>
        <p>DISMOUNTS</p>
        <p>JOHN ROETHLISBERGER's dislocated right index finger was wrapped in ice after preliminaries tonight. In Monday's team competition, Roethlisberger said he thought he would be able to compete in at least three events: the pommel horse, vault and still rings. . . . Russia's ALEXEI NEMOV finished first in the all-around preliminaries. . . . The Russians finished first in the team preliminaries, followed by China and the Ukraine. The United States, Japan and Romania rounded out the top six teams. South Korea and Belarus -- both expected to be medal contenders -- failed to qualify for the team competition.</p>
