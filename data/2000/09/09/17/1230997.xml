        <p>Change Me Into</p>
        <p>Zeus's Daughter</p>
        <p>A Memoir.</p>
        <p>By Barbara Robinette Moss.</p>
        <p>319 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Scribner. $24.</p>
        <p>THIS divinely titled memoir is Barbara Robinette Moss's all-too-mortal account of enduring bare cupboards and Daddy's fists in low-rent Alabama. Set during the 1960's as Moss, one of eight siblings, grows up hungry and sickly in a succession of ramshackle houses, the book is a Deep South cousin to Frank McCourt's ''Angela's Ashes.'' The age-old Irish woes, as McCourt listed them at the outset of his book, encapsulate this story of a Southern family with Irish roots: ''the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire.''</p>
        <p>Unlike McCourt, Moss is no dark humorist, and her grueling tale offers little comic relief. As a child, she's offered such poor nutrition that the bones in her face ''grew like a thin pine tree.'' Without dental care, her crooked teeth ''protruded so badly it was hard to swallow.'' Turning her ''unsightly, tangled face'' from strangers, she seeks refuge in her family, a turbulent clan walled off from the larger world -- until creditors come pounding at the door. Like Rick Bragg, who wrote eloquently of his own ''dirt poor'' upbringing in Alabama, Moss looks to her beleaguered mother for hope and strategies for survival.</p>
        <p>It is Moss's yearning to be pretty and to lose herself in nature's loveliness that provides the memoir's gloomy charm: ''I breathed in the sweet fragrance of mimosa blossoms and kept my head turned away from the faint stink of the outhouse.'' On one of those crystalline nights when stars fall on Alabama, she gazes at Venus and wishes to be the ''goddess of beauty, much-loved daughter of Zeus.''</p>
        <p>Whether her wish comes true, once she becomes an adult, is best left to the reader to discover. Suffice it to say that the ordeal she must undergo in offering her ''Silly Putty-stretched'' face for experimental surgery would make the squeamish among us, given the choice, opt for a fishing trip into the Perfect Storm.</p>
        <p>The questions become more urgent with every passing chapter: Why is this family so destitute? Why are this young girl's basic needs so resolutely ignored?</p>
        <p>Dorris Robinette and Stewart Karl Moss, called S. K., meet when they are both in the Marines. Dorris has studied art at Birmingham Southern, a private university, and after her marriage she works as a secretary. S. K. has no definable trade but is resourceful enough to try one get-rich scheme after another, from running moonshine to raising chickens under the house. Being white Southerners, nomadic small-town dwellers, they are held back neither by race nor by the failure of crops. Even with eight children, surely they could dependably scare up food for the table, could seek out a public clinic for their daughter.</p>
        <p>Moss's father is the sad cause of their plight. A hapless tyrant, S. K. is a sadist who inflicts pain ''recreationally, both physical and emotional.'' ''You belong to me,'' he tells his children, ''and I'll do with you what I want.'' As Moss explains, ''You didn't have to do anything -- anything at all -- to get pinched, poked, shoved or hit, just be where he could reach you when he was drunk.'' He slaps and kicks his eldest daughter to the floor, knocks his wife unconscious. A ne'er-do-well who guzzles his sporadic wages, he drives by black families in a civil rights march and yells, ''Get a goddamned job!''</p>
        <p>Some readers may put this book down during one of S. K.'s tirades, convinced he needs not a literary portrait but a restraining order. Memoir, in this case, has its limitations. The child's point of view stops when the parents' door is shut, and this child hasn't figured out how to penetrate the mysteries behind it. Had Moss chosen to write an autobiographical novel -- or got her parents to divulge more of what was going on in their hearts back then -- we might have gained better access to the tangle of emotions that drove her father to be so brutal and her mother so sheepishly deferential.</p>
        <p>A few scenes feel stage-managed, too, as though Moss, in an effort to unburden herself of this heavy legacy, has tidied ragged life into neat drama. When the memoir form serves her well, though -- as in the heartbreaking, naturally unfolding first chapter -- she takes us right in. At those times we can't help being moved by the image of a damaged little girl looking up at the sky, trying to make sense of a world turned to shambles by the big folks.</p>
