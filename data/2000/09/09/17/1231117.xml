        <p>TO pass through the door of littlethings, a 22-year-old store on Main Street here, is to enter a living, breathing land of Lilliputians.</p>
        <p>Along with several dozen doll houses for sale, there are more than 100,000 items that go inside them, all the size of fingernails: hat racks, bar stools, saws, latticework, soccer balls, cedar shingles, a watering can and even U.P.S. envelopes.</p>
        <p>There are also more than 500 varieties of doll house rugs, and an equal number of inch-high ''doll house dolls,'' with little porcelain faces and hands, held together by wire bodies. The inventory harkens back to a time when interactive play meant picking up two figurines and making them talk.</p>
        <p>The store is owned by Carroll O'Connor, an Irvington resident who looks as if she shares Judi Dench's genetic code. Mrs. O'Connor's interest in dolls grew out of a lifetime love of crafts. She has, in the past quarter century, seen it all in the world of doll houses, including one decorated as a 1960's psychedelic pad, including an ash tray complete with micro-size roach clips and marijuana cigarettes.</p>
        <p>Many who come into the store are charmed. ''People think it's a fantasy land,''  Mrs. O'Connor said with a smile that says the reality is more complicated. ''They come in and say what a great place to work.  They don't realize I have to do the books and pay bills'' and deal with other less than enchanting realities of running a business.</p>
        <p>On a recent day, Mrs. O'Connor had to put a conversation on hold while she haggled with a delivery man over whether a batch of miniature wallpaper should have come rolled up or not.</p>
        <p>Mrs. O'Connor's five-year goal for her store is at once very modest and wildly ambitious. She wants it to survive.</p>
        <p>Staying in business, after all, is very much an open question for any retail store in this sharp-elbowed retail environment. There is margin-pinching competition from chains, discounters and e-commerce, all nipping at their heels.</p>
        <p>Some of littlethings' competition sells cut-rate doll houses. Some of these even come predecorated, though that practice earns Mrs. O'Connor's contempt because of her feeling that doll houses, above all else, must be a personalized expression of self. The least expensive doll house in her store is $75, but a doll house kit, which comes with accessories, can run as high as $1,200. If a customer chooses to customize a doll house, it can climb into the thousands of dollars.</p>
        <p>Though only 20 percent of revenues and less of profits, doll houses are a big part of Mrs. O'Connor's business. They serve as a loss leader, something sold at a small profit in order to sell higher-margin items later. ''Sometimes people buy a doll house and nothing else, but you hope they'll eventually electrify, furnish, wallpaper, accessorize.''</p>
        <p>Competition isn't her only challenge. Her real unlucky number is the computer.</p>
        <p>''It used to be only nerdy boys with glasses that were in love with them,'' Mrs. O'Connor said. ''Now many girls are enamored too.'' This has cut into her business, because girls between 9 and 14 are her best customers. That there is a serious rival to their attention shows in the numbers. For her first 15 years of operation, sales growth increased every year, but the growth curve flattened out five years ago. Though no longer growing, littlethings continues to do good business, with revenue in the low six figures, Mrs. O'Connor said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. O'Connor has the advantage of what she describes as a market rate, though fair, rent. Because of the lack of parking in Irvington and the steep tilt of Main Street, which, while aesthetically pleasing, is not conducive to carrying shopping bags, rents are held in check.</p>
        <p>There is also her biggest hidden asset, and it's not one that can be found in a business textbook: the timeless attraction of the doll house. Though its popularity may have been hurt by the microchip, it hasn't been quashed.</p>
        <p>For an adult, Mrs. O'Connor said, a doll house can ''bring them outside themselves'' in a wholly controllable situation. The compact tidiness of a doll house can be a comfort to those whose lives may be otherwise chaotic. And even for those who don't have serious worries, doll houses can be useful.</p>
        <p>With a doll house, the urge to change, to redecorate a room, can be indulged because it's so manageable timewise and economically. ''You don't have to go to Ethan Allen, pay thousands, then wait 10 weeks for a sofa,'' Mrs. O'Connor said.</p>
        <p>Customers are so loyal to littlethings that  they will occasionally help out around the store, something the local dry cleaner can't rely on. Several years ago, an Irvington woman and doll house aficionado had a difficult mother-in-law living with her. The woman would leave her home and mother-in-law to spend hours in the store setting up displays. She never even asked to be paid.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. O'Connor's best -- and favorite -- customers are the girls.</p>
        <p>Childhood is so scheduled and fast paced today that, despite the temptations of computer games and e-mail, Mrs. O'Connor still gets girls who want something different. If they come in, they often get hooked because they get to experiment with putting something together in an artistic fashion. Also, through fantasy play with the house, they can master interactions and work through problems. That's why psychotherapists who treat children are also consistent customers, coming into the store to buy equipment for their offices.</p>
        <p>''They are always concerned with the bathrooms,'' Mrs. O'Connor said, because so much in therapy with young children involves play acting over potty training issues.</p>
        <p>On a recent day, a first-time customer came in, looked around what looked like an entire world left in a clothes dryer one cycle too long, and nearly screamed. ''Oh, my God,'' the woman finally said, ''how do you dust all of it?''</p>
        <p>''Hopefully,'' Mrs. O'Connor replied with a laugh, ''people will buy it and take it away before it gets dusty.''</p>
