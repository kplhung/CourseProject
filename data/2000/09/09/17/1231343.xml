        <p>ONCE, there was the smoke-filled room. These days, unsavory  politics is epitomized  with the phrase soft money.</p>
        <p>So far, much more hard money has been spent on the New York Senate race than soft money. But  at their first debate last week, Representative Rick A. Lazio  strode over to Hillary Rodham  Clinton's lectern and asked her to sign a pledge against taking soft money. She demurred, calling him  the real soft-money scofflaw.</p>
        <p>Soft money is a contribution to political parties, rather than to the candidates themselves. It is supposed to pay only for party activities, like voter drives. But the parties have found ways to channel the money to help candidates, usually by buying commercials. (Some definitions also consider spending by outside groups unconnected to the parties as soft money.) There is no ceiling on soft money donations. Moreover,  unions and corporations, which are barred from donating hard dollars in federal elections, can give soft ones.</p>
        <p>The term may have been invented to contrast with hard dollars that candidates collect directly, though some advocates of campaign finance reform think the term doesn't sound nefarious enough.</p>
