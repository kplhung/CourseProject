        <p>Chase Manhattan Bank, yielding to pressure from residents, decides to keep only bank branch on New York City's Roosevelt Island open two days a week until its lease runs out in July 2001; photos (M)</p>

        <p>Roosevelt Island has one pharmacy, one pizzeria, one video store, one deli, one of just about everything. This allows the 9,000 people who live or work on this sliver of land in the East River to do errands without taking the subway to Queens or the tram to Manhattan. So when Chase Manhattan announced in July that the one bank branch would close on Oct. 20, residents and merchants were upset.</p>
        <p>Maria Stoica, 55, who manages Island Flowers and Gifts, wondered what she would do, because she does not drive and the nearest Chase branch was across the bridge in Long Island City. Kaie Raza, 51, the  owner of Trellis, the island's one diner, worried about getting the $300 or $400 of loose change each week that his customers need to do their laundry or take the 25-cent Roosevelt Island shuttle bus. Carol Brown, a home attendant from Brooklyn, feared she would have to take days off to visit her home branch in Bedford-Stuyvesant during work hours.</p>

        <p>Roosevelt Island has one pharmacy, one pizzeria, one video store, one deli, one of just about everything. This allows the 9,000 people who live or work on this sliver of land in the East River to do errands without taking the subway to Queens or the tram to Manhattan. So when Chase Manhattan announced in July that the one bank branch would close on Oct. 20, residents and merchants were upset.</p>
        <p>Maria Stoica, 55, who manages Island Flowers and Gifts, wondered what she would do, because she does not drive and the nearest Chase branch was across the bridge in Long Island City. Kaie Raza, 51, the  owner of Trellis, the island's one diner, worried about getting the $300 or $400 of loose change each week that his customers need to do their laundry or take the 25-cent Roosevelt Island shuttle bus. Carol Brown, a home attendant from Brooklyn, feared she would have to take days off to visit her home branch in Bedford-Stuyvesant during work hours.</p>
        <p>The predicament was worse for the many elderly and disabled who live on the island, many of whom are residents at Coler-Goldwater Hospital, which offers rehabilitation care.</p>
        <p>Then Chase informed island officials last week that the branch would remain open two days a week until its lease ran out in July 2001.</p>
        <p>''The community has asked us to continue to serve them, and we have decided to stay,'' said Judy Miller, a Chase spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>The extra time will allow the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, a state-run organization that operates the island under a lease from the city, more time to search for a replacement. Robert Ryan, the corporation's president, said letters had been sent to 99 banks in the region, 5 of which had expressed interest.</p>
        <p>Islanders had mixed reactions to the change. ''In a way it's good news,'' Ms. Stoica said. ''But then what happens after 10 months?''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, customers who want a local bank must decide whether to stick with Chase's limited hours or open an account with the Montauk Credit Union, which has operated one of its two branches on Roosevelt Island since 1997.</p>
        <p>The credit union has reported a slight increase in new accounts since Chase first notified the public they were leaving, but some residents are hesitant to leave a commercial bank that has branches all over the city.</p>
