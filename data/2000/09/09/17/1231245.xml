        <p>Having been a visitor to the town of Thornwood recently (and several times before), I found the article  regarding the problem of blaring fire sirens in Westchester (and apparently elsewhere) quite interesting [''Fight Over Fire Siren in Thornwood,'' Sept. 3].</p>
        <p>I have witnessed the sound of that siren at noon (which I understand is each and every day) -- it is absolutely nerve-racking; it makes you skip a heartbeat and leaves you literally shaking. You really think World War III has just started.</p>

        <p>Having been a visitor to the town of Thornwood recently (and several times before), I found the article  regarding the problem of blaring fire sirens in Westchester (and apparently elsewhere) quite interesting [''Fight Over Fire Siren in Thornwood,'' Sept. 3].</p>
        <p>I have witnessed the sound of that siren at noon (which I understand is each and every day) -- it is absolutely nerve-racking; it makes you skip a heartbeat and leaves you literally shaking. You really think World War III has just started.</p>
        <p>What struck me most was the uncaring response of Commissioner Richard Benkwitt when he referred to the concerns of residents of Thornwood and making light of those concerns by stating: ''They're worrying about a siren and talking about being up for an hour.''</p>
        <p>But then, when reference was made to his using a beeper (as most communities across the country do), he stated: ''If I take a beeper into my bedroom it wakes up my whole family . . . it's like being a criminal.''</p>
        <p>It is quite obvious that Commissioner Benkwitt needs the siren in front of his house in order for him to get the full feeling of the siren's effect on the residents of Thornwood.</p>
        <p>He should be concerned for the residents and children of any neighborhood that has to deal with this type of pollution.</p>
