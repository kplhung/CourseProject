        <p>HIS confidence is no trick. Few choreographers today have the same fiery belief in the power and the possibilities of ballet to function as a grown-up form of entertainment. At 43, David Bintley has already created eight full-evening story ballets. The ninth is in rehearsal, and he is plotting his tenth.</p>
        <p>''It's what I do,'' says Mr. Bintley, the artistic director of the Birmingham Royal Ballet. ''For better or worse. I am fatally attracted to that form. I can't leave it alone. The field is just so wide open to do the exciting, the different, the new.''</p>

        <p>HIS confidence is no trick. Few choreographers today have the same fiery belief in the power and the possibilities of ballet to function as a grown-up form of entertainment. At 43, David Bintley has already created eight full-evening story ballets. The ninth is in rehearsal, and he is plotting his tenth.</p>
        <p>''It's what I do,'' says Mr. Bintley, the artistic director of the Birmingham Royal Ballet. ''For better or worse. I am fatally attracted to that form. I can't leave it alone. The field is just so wide open to do the exciting, the different, the new.''</p>
        <p>One of his creations, ''Edward II,'' based on the Marlowe play, will lead off the Birmingham company's Manhattan debut, a 10-day season that starts on Thursday at City Center. ''Edward II'' will be followed by something completely different, an evening of three ballets to jazz scores by Duke Ellington and Richard Rodgers. The two Ellington pieces are Mr. Bintley's choreography (in addition to his full-evening ballets, he has some 35 one-act creations to his credit). The Rodgers is George Balanchine's ''Slaughter on Tenth Avenue,'' redesigned for the Birmingham company last season.</p>
        <p>Birmingham is England's second city, and the company is its second Royal Ballet, but Mr. Bintley plays that position to advantage. ''I like being part of a company which -- how should I put this? -- which is never thought of as being the best, because we are not the 'real' Royal Ballet at home in Covent Garden. So we have the fun of coming from behind. I like the excitement, the spirit of creative pioneering. We still have lots of areas to explore, lots of places to go. We aren't chasing a reputation that was made a long, long time ago.''</p>
        <p>Birmingham's longtime reputation was as an industrial overachiever, neither pretty nor a tourist destination, a city dominated by concrete monoliths built after World War II. In the last 20 years, the city fathers have begun to spruce up the image, and large swaths of Birmingham have been upgraded. Now it is home to boutiques, trendy restaurants, even warehouse loft apartments. There are also theaters, hotels, shopping malls and pedestrian precincts dotted with as much new public sculpture as there is in Paris (and far more than in London).</p>
        <p>The city's artistic flagship has been the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra under Simon Rattle. In the beginning, Sir Simon and the city took a creative gamble on each other: he was a young whiz-kid when he arrived in 1980 (he is just two years Mr. Bintley's senior). Today he is director-designate of the Berlin Philharmonic. Under Sir Simon, the orchestra climbed the ladder of international celebrity, taking the city's profile with it. By 1991, when the impressive new Symphony Hall opened in triumph, the city fathers' thirst for recognition had more than paid off.</p>
        <p>The Birmingham Royal Ballet's tour to New York and Chicago (America's own second city) is a next step in the search for civic glory. Mr. Bintley's approach fits right in. ''I'm interested in now,'' he says. This, of course, means there is a price to be paid. No choreographer has a 100 percent track record, and Mr. Bintley's experiments with story ballets strike his critics as over the top, to say nothing of top-heavy. Some view them as spectacles for the sake of spectacle (his update of ''Sylvia''), or misguided from the outset (his stagings culled from the pages of English literature: ''Hobson's Choice,'' ''Far From the Madding Crowd'' and ''Edward II'').</p>
        <p>And then there is the biggest Bintley ballet of them all: ''Arthur.'' By the time this saga of the Knights of the Round Table is finished, it will take up two full evenings. Part 1 had its premiere in January, just before the company's home, the Birmingham Hippodrome, was closed for a substantial face lift. ''Arthur, Part 2'' is to open the refurbished premises early next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bintley's company does perform the great 19th-century classics, and he is appreciated for tending the legacy of English geniuses like Frederick Ashton, but he goes way beyond preserving the glories of the past. ''I'm not interested in some archaic idea of how 'things used to be,' '' he says. ''I am interested in the English style as it pertains to now''</p>
        <p>With ''Edward II'' he has created a ballet without an ounce of historical nostalgia. His gory parable of corruption is a bold attempt to coax ballet into a realm where adult themes sit side by side with classical dancing. What makes the tragedy of ''Edward II'' particularly watchable is the cogent clarity of its storytelling conveyed through deftly varied, virtually nonstop choreography.</p>
        <p>A gut-wrenching, emotional roller coaster, it has all the pageantry and sweep of a cinema epic, but its tale of dynastic power struggles and regicide happen to be true. Some 800 years ago, England was plunged into a devastating civil war that culminated in one of the most fearsome royal murders in all of history.</p>
        <p>Both sexually explicit and frighteningly brutal, the ballet is not for the squeamish. ''I'm not pulling any punches,'' says Mr. Bintley. ''Besides, you don't need to sensationalize an already sensational story. There is nothing in my ballet that didn't happen in history.'' And when it comes to dreaming up particularly nasty ways of destroying your enemies, these feuding feudal lords could teach even Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie a trick or two.</p>
        <p>After the horrific events of ''Edward II,'' the jazz ballets are a carnival fun house, not least because of the rollicking pit band known as Echoes of Ellington. Make sure you spend most of the intermission at the edge of the orchestra pit, to cheer, clap and even dance in the aisles as the band cuts loose in jam sessions bubbling over with infectious enthusiasm. Talk about ''in the mood''; by the time the curtain goes up, the audience is primed for an intense dance experience.</p>
        <p>''The Nutcracker Sweeties,'' to Ellington, is goofy fun, a sly, wry take on Tchaikovsky. Mr. Bintley gives it a 1940's tinge. The Sugar Plum Fairy, named by Ellington the Sugar Rum Cherry, is transformed into a Rita Hayworth femme fatale in a slinky red evening gown. There's a Chinatown episode in which a sailor on shore leave is seduced by a woman from the mysterious East. A giant camel, a cut-out blown up from the cigarette pack, takes the stage for the Arabian dance, and the all-American red, white and blue finale is a giddy mix of flashing neon and wholesome high jinks. The clever costumes come from the British fashion designer Jasper Conran.</p>
        <p>''The Shakespeare Suite'' is mostly from ''Such Sweet Thunder,'' Ellington's evocation of the Bard's heroes and heroines. It opens with a powerhouse solo for Hamlet that would be a show stopper in any Broadway musical. There's comedy for Kate and Petruchio, punk kilts for the Macbeths, sneakers, bubble gum and other contemporary touches that bounce along on the surface of Ellington's rich rhythms.</p>
        <p>Technically, the Birmingham Royal Ballet is only a decade old. Until 1990, it was the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet, which was established in the 1930's, but it moved out of London when Birmingham made the company an offer it couldn't refuse. The city not only pumped millions into the transfer; it also gave the company money to build expansive studios right behind the theater and guaranteed an annual infusion into the company's coffers. A decade later, like Pina Bausch in Wuppertal or Helgi Tomasson in San Francisco -- the Birmingham Royal Ballet is in the enviable position of having the world come to it.</p>
        <p>T HERE are 60 dancers in the company, and Mr. Bintley says the size is ideal: ''Everybody gets the chance to dance all the time, and I can stay in touch with all of them. If you're talking 80 to 90 dancers, you can't satisfy them all, can't give them all time on the stage. More importantly, you can't have a personal relationship with 90 people.</p>
        <p>''We have a family feeling here, and everybody is an individual. I don't hire anybody for the corps. I hire everybody for higher things. Some of them might not make it, but I don't hire people thinking they'd look nice standing in a row for a couple of hours.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bintley has been involved with this company all of his working life. He joined it as a dancer in 1976, made his first full-evening ballet in 1982 and has been artistic director since 1995. ''Now is absolutely the right time to go to New York'' he says. ''The company is ready, poised. We are able to say: 'Hey, here is another English company, and we're very different from what you've come to expect from a Royal Ballet.' ''</p>
        <p>But doesn't he consider it risky taking Balanchine to his home turf? ''Sure, of course I do,'' he says. ''But on the other hand, why not? The Balanchine Trust and the Robbins people know that if they give us a piece we're going to do better than our best. That's the reputation we've built with them and that's the reputation we seek to preserve in every aspect. They've been to Birmingham, they know what it's like.</p>
        <p>''I have a company that comes from all over the place but is a homogenous unit. We don't have half a dozen different styles in there, but we do have a company that is adept at appropriating any style. I don't want to say we've given 'Slaughter' a new lease on life, but I think we have. Again, we're not going to be saying, 'We can do it better,' but I thought: 'Let's take Balanchine to New York and show how we do it. Let's leap into the fire.' ''</p>
        <p>''Besides, I don't think America has seen a piece like 'Edward,' '' he continues. ''It's got this uncompromising profile. It's either: 'I hate it' or 'It's one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.' You can't be tepid or indifferent toward 'Edward,' but even if you do hate it, no one can deny that this is a company of fine dancers. I have some dancers who could work in any company in the world, but I don't want them to, so I have to keep their lives interesting. And what could be more interesting for a dancer than to appear in New York?''</p>
