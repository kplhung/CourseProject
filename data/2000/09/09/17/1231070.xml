        <p>YOU and I will not be having this discussion after Labor Day,'' Paul B. Guenther, the chairman of the New York Philharmonic, bravely declared last April.

        <p>YOU and I will not be having this discussion after Labor Day,'' Paul B. Guenther, the chairman of the New York Philharmonic, bravely declared last April. ''Either that or you'll be talking to my successor here.'' In effect, Mr. Guenther was promising that the orchestra would have named its next music director by now. But who's keeping track? (Probably no one on the Philharmonic's board; who would want to take over Mr. Guenther's position and its problems just now?)</p>
        <p>Mr. Guenther could hardly be blamed for feeling euphoric at the time; he had cast two lures, and a big fish was nibbling at each. In the end, the bigger one, Riccardo Muti, got away as music director. But Mr. Guenther landed the other one: Zarin Mehta took over as the orchestra's executive director just after Labor Day, replacing Deborah Borda, who decamped last December for a similar position with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. And with the kinds of difficulties American orchestras face today, Mr. Mehta may well prove the more important catch.</p>
        <p>At 61, he is considered a star in the small world of classical-music management. Mr. Guenther has said that every other candidate interviewed for the position suggested that Mr. Mehta would be the ideal choice if he were available but that the Philharmonic would never get him. Mr. Mehta, who was the managing director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra from 1981 to 1991, when he became executive director of the Ravinia Festival in Highland Park, Ill., the summer home of the Chicago Symphony, had just signed another five-year contract with Ravinia when the Philharmonic came calling.</p>
        <p>Even before arriving in New York, Mr. Mehta took a hand in the search for a new music director to replace Kurt Masur in 2002. In addition, Mr. Mehta seems to have wasted little time in papering over the Philharmonic's shattered relationship with Mr. Masur, who opens his 10th season on Wednesday at Avery Fisher Hall. Mr. Masur said in May that he had no dates scheduled with the orchestra after the end of his tenure.</p>
        <p>''Masur's going to guest conduct,'' Zarin Mehta said on Sept. 5, his first day on the job, looking instantly at home, sitting at a conference table before an outsize bust of Mahler in his spacious office at Avery Fisher Hall. ''He has three weeks already for the 2002-3 season. He and I go back many years, and I'm looking forward to working on his last two seasons with us and making sure that things are done properly for him. I'd like to do something special in his final summer, 2002.''</p>
        <p>As for the stalled search for Mr. Masur's successor, now more than two years old, Mr. Mehta said that it would go forward as soon as the orchestra returned from its vacation.</p>
        <p>''All the eggs were in one basket,'' he said of the Muti courtship.</p>
        <p>Word of a short list of candidates leaked from the Philharmonic last spring. Along with Mr. Muti, who broke off negotiations in July, the list named two people Mr. Mehta would probably find congenial: Mariss Jansons, the music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony and the associate principal conductor of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic in Russia, whose work Mr. Mehta is said to admire; and Christoph Eschenbach, until recently the music director of the Houston Symphony, whom Mr. Mehta hired to succeed James Levine as music director at Ravinia in 1995.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehta is also said to have discussed the Philharmonic vacancy in at least vague terms with Daniel Barenboim, the music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and of the Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin. But Mr. Mehta would not be drawn into a discussion of individual candidates.</p>
        <p>''I've seen the 'short list' of candidates people talk about, and it has names that could not possibly be involved with the Philharmonic for a variety of reasons,'' Mr. Mehta said. ''It wasn't a short list so much as a wish list. So we have to be practical, and you will find that I'm a very practical person.''</p>
        <p>Not that the search is starting again from scratch. Indeed, Mr. Mehta, undaunted by failed predictions like Mr. Guenther's, said he hopes to see a music director appointed by the end of the year. Nor does Mr. Guenther himself hesitate to crawl out on another limb.</p>
        <p>''It's not unreasonable to think that it could happen by the end of the year,'' Mr. Guenther echoed last week, citing Mr. Mehta's very presence and involvement as factors attractive to potential candidates.</p>
        <p>TIME is of the essence for Mr. Mehta. ''Even if the new conductor is not available for more than two weeks or six weeks or whatever in 2002-3, it is important that the person be named as music director between now and then,'' he said. ''I have no pretension of being music director. None at all. I'm a very opinionated person, but I keep my opinions to myself. I want to work with somebody. I've already started planning that season in terms of conductors, general layout, when a tour can take place. But soon I have to jump in with both feet.''</p>
        <p>To help develop a cohesive season with interesting programming, Mr. Mehta is trying to hire fewer guest conductors than usual, for periods longer than single weeks, a practice he would like to see continue when a music director arrives. The conductors he mentions for 2002-3 are unsurprising: Mr. Muti, Charles Dutoit and Sir Colin Davis in addition to Mr. Masur. (It would hardly be surprising or amiss if Zubin Mehta, Zarin's older brother, who was music director before Mr. Masur, were represented as well, though Zarin Mehta seems to go out of his way to avoid any appearance of favoritism.) Mr. Mehta is also brainstorming with established maestros like Pierre Boulez, Zubin Mehta's predecessor as music director of the Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>Yet for all his protestations of avoiding artistic interference, Zarin Mehta makes it clear that he will take a stronger hand in artistic administration than some of his peers, who delegate much of the responsibility. Welz Kauffman, the orchestra's last artistic administrator, followed Ms. Borda to Los Angeles in May and recently replaced Mr. Mehta at Ravinia, starting that job the same day Mr. Mehta began his. Mr. Mehta has just hired the less-experienced Jeremy Geffen from the Aspen Music Festival as artistic administrator.</p>
        <p>''He will be my right hand,'' Mr. Mehta said. ''But the only reason I'm in this business is because I like music. The thought of not being involved in the creation of what happens -- every cancellation to me is a challenge. As I say, I've sat down and looked at 2002-3. I have looked at the summers of 2001 and 2002, and Masur and I have already talked about a couple of ideas. I don't want anyone else to do that. If I was going to administer just anything, I would have taken a commercial job somewhere.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Mehta began his working life in a commercial position, with the accounting firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Montreal. Unlike Zubin Mehta, Zarin never had aspirations as a performer, though he developed a broad familiarity with music early. He was born in Bombay in 1938, a son of Mehli Mehta, a violinist and conductor, who founded the Bombay Symphony in 1935.</p>
        <p>''I guess it's osmosis,'' Zarin Mehta said. ''No, actually, it's more than that. We have four children, and they grew up in music even before I went to the Montreal Symphony in 1981. My wife is a singer. There was music in the house, because of teaching. Musicians were always there. But none of my children had the same interest in classical music that Zubin and I did from listening to music on 78's in India.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehta is married to Carmen Lasky and the father of two of her children, who are now in their 30's. The other two he calls his own were Ms. Lasky's from a previous marriage, to Zubin Mehta. (Bejun Mehta, who first made his name as a boy soprano and has recently established himself in New York as a countertenor, is a cousin of the Mehta brothers.)</p>
        <p>''The business of music is something quite different,'' Zarin Mehta said. ''That comes kind of naturally. My father ran his own concerts and chamber concerts, so it became kind of a business, and it was talked about at the dinner table. Zubin and I both went into nonmusical directions for a time. At that stage there was never any thought of our going into the profession, because in Bombay there really wasn't a profession.''</p>
        <p>Zubin Mehta eventually went to Vienna to join a cousin who was studying piano, and the rest is musical history. Zarin Mehta, still in his teens, went to study accounting in London, where he attended concerts often, usually in standing room. In 1962, he took up his job in Canada with his lively musical interest in tow.</p>
        <p>The Montreal Symphony's administration fell into disarray in the 1970's, when no suitable executive could be found (fluency in French being the major hurdle). From his position on the board, Mr. Mehta played a major role in the hiring of Mr. Dutoit as music director in 1976. And finally, with no end of the fruitless search for an executive in sight, Mr. Mehta took over the management of the orchestra himself, guiding it into an era of international acclaim that lasts to this day.</p>
        <p>At Ravinia, he produced a similar run of successes. In 1995, the year Mr. Eschenbach took over as music director, the festival also unveiled a $12 million renovation of its facilities. Mr. Mehta formed the Ravinia Festival Orchestra and instituted programs in jazz and contemporary music as well as forums for young performers. To those who knew him, he seemed as content with his situation as the board was with him, and it may never have occurred to either party that the new five-year contract signed last fall would be a problem.</p>
        <p>''Of course it was difficult,'' Mr. Mehta said of his premature departure. ''They were extremely disappointed. They tried to talk me out of it. At the same time, I think they realized that this was an opportunity that was right for me. That's all I can say.''</p>
        <p>He professes to find New York irresistibly appealing; and hardly less so, the sheer prospect of change.</p>
        <p>''It's something so different from what I've been doing, and it's nice to have fresh air every so often. Without ever planning it, it's just worked out that every 10 years I have a natural change of direction. I certainly didn't plan this. And in the last three months I've said: 'Well why? I'm in a very comfortable position in a lovely city. Why am I doing this?' But I think it's to wake up again.''</p>
        <p>Wakeup calls are sure to come, not only in Mr. Mehta's dealings with the Philharmonic players, though their reputation for obstreperousness seems happily to have faded in recent years, but also in his dealings with the unwieldy bureaucracy of Lincoln Center. Extensive renovation lies ahead at Avery Fisher Hall as at most of the other buildings in the center, and Mr. Mehta does not yet know exactly what to expect or when it may happen.</p>
        <p>''Of course I'd like to see Avery Fisher Hall sound better,'' he said. ''And look better.''</p>
        <p>Also problematic is the Lincoln Center Festival, in which the Philharmonic has served honorably over five years to relatively little reward.</p>
        <p>''The rest of the festival is extremely avant-garde,'' Mr. Mehta said. ''But we're the only constituent group that's performing regularly. I think it's wrong for the Philharmonic to play to one-third houses. I like to think we have a certain self-respect, and we shouldn't be doing that sort of thing.'' The Philharmonic will not participate next year for other reasons, and any future involvement, Mr. Mehta said, will hinge on programmatic interest, like, perhaps, that Masur tribute in 2002.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehta is clearly not a man to trifle with, a quality that should serve him well in New York, at Lincoln Center and with the feisty Philharmonic.</p>
