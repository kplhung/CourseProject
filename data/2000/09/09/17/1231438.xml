        <p>The Conservative Party of New York has begun broadcasting a 30-second spot on behalf of the Senate campaign of the Republican Rick A. Lazio.</p>
        <p>TITLE -- ''See Your Doctor''</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Warfield &amp; Company</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial, which has a sharply satiric tone, opens with an unflattering photograph of Hillary Rodham Clinton and text saying, ''Remember the last time we trusted Hillary Clinton with an important job in Washington?'' The word ''trust'' is highlighted. The advertisement discusses Mrs. Clinton's role in the effort to reshape the nation's health care system and cuts to a scene featuring the children's game Operation. An arm clearly meant to be Mrs. Clinton's uses a scalpel to poke parts of a cartoon character's body, repeatedly resulting in electric shocks as the narrator details what he suggests are the many damaging elements of her health care plan. The commercial closes with another image of Mrs. Clinton and says, ''If you trust Hillary Clinton, maybe you should see your doctor.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''Remember the last time we trusted Hillary Clinton with an important job in Washington? In 1993 she operated on health care. She proposed a government-run system. A bureaucratic plan of rationing. That destroyed your choice of doctors. A 27 percent tax increase, with two million jobs lost. She worked in secret and had to be sued to disclose the details. So if you trust Hillary Clinton, maybe you should see your doctor. While you still can.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mrs. Clinton led a presidential commission that in closed-door sessions devised the universal health care plan that President Clinton proposed in 1993. The bill would have required most Americans to get coverage through large regional purchasing groups and could have had the effect of limiting some people's choices of doctors. Employers would have been required to cover much of the cost, but an increase in the cigarette tax was also proposed. Suggestions that it would have required a 27 percent tax increase or result in the loss of two million jobs are most probably overstatements, but some Clinton administration officials agreed that the cost would have been very large.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The ad pokes fun at what many people think could be a major problem for Mrs. Clinton, the ill-fated health care campaign that raised questions about her competence, her view of government and management style.</p>
