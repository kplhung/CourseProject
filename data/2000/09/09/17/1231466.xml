        <p>There are powerful images that can be fleeting, and those that are unforgettable and real. One night after choreographing a utopian multiculturalism that smacked of fiction, the host Australians trotted out the real deal for the world to behold.</p>
        <p>Ian Thorpe lit a different kind of flame through water at the Olympic aquatic center tonight, the kind that ignites passion for sport, by winning gold in the 400-meter freestyle and the 4 x 100-freestyle relay. Both performances were world records. Success for the 17-year-old swimming prodigy with the size 17 feet was supposed to be as scripted as the overdone torch-lighting finale to Friday night's opening ceremony, but Thorpe reminded us why the great athlete is invariably more about improvisation than show.</p>
        <p>''He does amaze me,'' the Italian Massimiliano Rosolino said after finishing a distant second to Thorpe in the men's 400-meter freestyle final, which later became almost a footnote to Thorpe's last 50 meters of the 4x100 freestyle relay which brought the delighted Aussies another gold.</p>
        <p>''I think,'' Rosolino added, ''he was born to swim.''</p>
        <p>I understand that suspicions are typically raised in this sport right along with the performance bar, and not without good reason. Yet after watching young Mr. Thorpe churn powerfully through the pool, after seeing him smile and hearing him speak, here's wishing him a long career in which those drug tests come up squeaky clean.</p>
        <p>The kid's got a magnetic and Tiger-like presence, to go along with a 6-foot-5-inch, 210-pound body and a stroke that is nearly nine feet long. You don't have to be the type who memorizes split times to notice how smooth and relaxed and technically superior he is, compared even with the talented Olympians in the lanes all around him. So, hopefully, Thorpe is exactly what his coaches and countrymen have hailed him as, that picture of aquatic perfection who comes along once in a lifetime. And what wonderful luck for the Aussies that he's happened by, in time to put a transcendent local stamp on the Sydney Games.</p>
        <p>It is the rare Olympian who rises above the nationalistic prattle, who commands an international audience and holds it. From this American journalist's point of view, Katarina Witt comes to mind, as does the Norwegian speedskater Johann Olav Koss. Thus the size of the news media turnout for the first glimpse of Australia's ''Thorpedo'' told a story in itself, as did some of the familiar faces in the crowd.</p>
        <p>Chelsea Clinton was in the house. Monica Seles and Lindsay Davenport rushed by me on the way to their seats. Many of the top Australian Olympians secured poolside seating, as if summoned by the prime minister himself. And then there was the American gold medalist from the women's 4 x 100 freestyle relay team, Dara Torres, who rode a bus to the Center with Thorpe and took the opportunity to gawk.</p>
        <p>''I said to my coach, 'Oh my God, look at his hands,' '' Torres said. ''Then I had to see his feet and I said, 'He's not a boy; he's a man.' ''</p>
        <p>After setting an Olympic record in a morning heat of the 400-meter freestyle, Thorpe broke it in the evening final. After losing a lead he'd been given for the anchor leg of the 4 x 100 relay, he had enough of a kick to reclaim in the last 20 meters from the American Gary Hall Jr., giving Australia the gold in an Olympic event the United States had never lost.</p>
        <p>''An absolute blur to me,'' Thorpe called the last 20 meters, before describing the moment his hand touched the wall with an intuition beyond his years.</p>
        <p>He said he didn't see his teammates celebrating. He didn't hear the crowd. He didn't check the board.</p>
        <p>''At that stage,'' he said, ''I just had a feeling.''</p>
        <p>It was 24 hours of such titillation for Aussies, coast to coast. Swimming is their passion, and Thorpe had delivered. The indigenous Aborigines are their shame, yet the selection of Cathy Freeman to light the flame had been a stroke of telemarketing genius.</p>
        <p>Except, apparently, for those she represented most.</p>
        <p>''I'm not knocking Cathy -- I'm knocking the people who have used her,'' Isabell Coe, one of the organizers of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy inside Victoria Park, had said earlier in the day. ''It was just another token gesture.''</p>
        <p>Several people I spoke to in the park said that having their Aboriginal Olympian center stage wouldn't raise anyone's standard of living. None of the tent dwellers actually watched the opening ceremonies Friday night, but several said they would love to see Freeman run the 400 meters, which she is favored to win.</p>
        <p>''We've got hundreds of Cathy Freemans out there and they are never given a chance,'' Coe said. ''When she runs, that will send a real message to the world that she is fighting for us.''</p>
        <p>Freeman will get her chance, the way Thorpe did tonight. Pageantry is pretty, but it is contrived and wishful, an image that fades. We'll remember Ian Thorpe catching Gary Hall Jr., though, and that the true Olympic flame burns deep inside.</p>
