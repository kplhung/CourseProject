        <p>NIGHT LIGHTS. By Steven Schnur. Illustrated by Stacey Schuett. Frances Foster/Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $16. (Ages 3 and up) Here's a counting book in the form of a bedtime ritual as one little girl, Melinda, counts the lights each night, starting with her night light and moving out of her room into the world and the dark sky. Lush, dark illustrations.</p>
        <p>MILTON. Written and illustrated by Hayde Ardalan. Chronicle. $7.95. (All ages) An autobiographical celebration of an ''exceptional'' black-and-white cat named Milton, told in 110 words of text and simple, stylish illustrations. Milton is highly pleased with himself and very amusing.</p>
        <p>DARKNESS OVER DENMARK: The Danish Resistance and the Rescue of the Jews. By Ellen Levine. Holiday House. $18.95. (Ages 10 and up) There are several fine, widely read novels for young readers about the remarkable Danish resistance during World War II, so this well-researched nonfiction account, which includes interviews with participants Jewish and not, is particularly welcome. There's a chronology and an excellent bibliography.</p>
        <p>GERSHON'S MONSTER: A Story for the Jewish New Year. By Eric A. Kimmel. Illustrated by Jon J. Muth. Scholastic. $16.95. (Ages 5 to 9) Gershon, a wealthy but childless baker, pitches his rudeness and misdeeds into the cellar and each year, instead of repenting, tosses them into the sea. With the help of a wise rabbi, precious children are born, but under a spell. This Hasidic story of how the baker learns t'shuvah -- repentance -- is beautifully told and illustrated.</p>
        <p>THE DEMONS' MISTAKE: A Story From Chelm. By Francine Prose. Illustrated by Mark Podwal. Greenwillow. $15.95. (Ages 5 and up) The invisible demons of Chelm, that Polish town where the people are so simple, decide to go to America, where the streets are said to be paved with gold. The shrewdly imaginative story about what demons might do in today's New York City is illustrated with delicate, abstract pastels. Worth reading aloud.</p>
        <p>NIGHT HOOPS. By Carl Deuker. Houghton Mifflin. $15. (Ages 12 and up) The Abbotts and the Dawsons live across the street from each other, and both Nick Abbott and Trent Dawson play basketball. That's all they seem to have in common. But nothing is as it seems, except the actual basketball games. A taut psychological novel.</p>
        <p>COMES A WIND. By Linda Arms White. Illustrated by Tom Curry. Melanie Kroupa/DK Ink. $15.95. (Ages 4 to 8) Clement and Clyde promise Mama that for her birthday they will behave nicely. They sit on the porch boasting, cowboy style, till a real wind comes up and they have to cooperate to rescue their mother.</p>
        <p>BATTLE DRESS. By Amy Efaw. HarperCollins. $15.95. (Ages 12 and up) The author of this first novel graduated from West Point in 1989. The heroine, Andi Davis, is sure that because her home life has been so miserable, she will be able to survive the hazing and the discipline of the military academy. In fact, it's a terrible struggle. There's a glossary of cadet slang and military terms.</p>
        <p>NO DINNER! The Story of the Old Woman and the Pumpkin. Written and illustrated by Jessica Souhami. Marshall Cavendish. $15.95. (Ages 5 to 9) No Red Riding Hood, either. Instead, here's a skinny Indian granny who goes through the forest to visit her granddaughter and then returns. They are both very clever, outwitting the wild beasts who would attack the old woman.</p>
