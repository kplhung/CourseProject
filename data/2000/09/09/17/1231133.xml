        <p>CLINTON and Lazio. Gore and Bush. They may have the attention of most New York voters these days, but in Nassau County, the races to watch are more local, much more local.</p>
        <p>While virtually ignoring the headline-grabbing elections, the county's Republican Party has already poured $1 million into the campaigns for the six Town Council seats in Hempstead, which with 725,000 residents is home to one in four Long Islanders. The Democrats have scrambled for a strategy to counter the juggernaut of spending. And the reason for the two parties' laser focus on the town elections is simple: the fate of the Nassau County Republican Party, perhaps the nation's last great party machine, hinges on the outcome.</p>
        <p>Republicans and Democrats alike point to Hempstead Town as the soul of the county Republican Party, and they agree that if the Republican Party loses its hold on Hempstead politics, their vaunted political machine would collapse.</p>
        <p>''The political stakes are very high,'' said Herbert D. Rosenbaum, a professor emeritus of political science at Hofstra University. ''For the Republicans, the town is one of the anchors of the state system organizationally. It has always meant Republican predominance at the ballot box and in public office and that's a lot of power and patronage.''</p>
        <p>For decades, the Hempstead Republicans have provided Nassau County with a steady flow of party chairmen and county executives. All but one of the six county executives in Nassau's history were Republicans who began their political career in Hempstead. The Hempstead machine also supplied such statewide Republican fixtures as Joseph J. Carlino, the speaker of the State Assembly in the early 1960's, and Alfonse M. D'Amato, who had three terms in the United States Senate and a kingmaker role that included the selection of George E. Pataki as the Republican gubernatorial candidate in 1994.</p>
        <p>''The Republicans can't afford to lose Hempstead,'' said one longtime Republican political observer. ''If they lost that core, it would take several political generations to rebuild. As the Town of Hempstead goes, so go the future generations of the Nassau County Republican Party.''</p>
        <p>For the better part of a century, the Town of Hempstead had been the very definition of one-party rule. But last year, in the backlash against Nassau County's Republican leadership and the fiscal crisis it had wrought, voters gave control of the county Legislature to the Democrats for the first time in 83 years, and their anger spilled over into the town elections. Three Democrats were elected to the Hempstead Town Council, a place no Democrat had sat since 1905. Republicans maintained the thinnest majority, with Supervisor Richard J. Guardino wielding a tie-breaking seventh vote.</p>
        <p>This year, a special election was called for Nov. 7 after a 12-year-old voting rights lawsuit successfully challenged Hempstead's at-large voting system and created six local council districts.</p>
        <p>Democrats hope the voter rebellion will continue and maybe even help them capture the Republican redoubt. But since the beginning of the year, Republicans have methodically stressed the message that the county's mismanagement is not the fault of the town. The drumbeat got louder over the summer, and no doubt will continue right up until Election Day.</p>
        <p>The campaign to distinguish the county from the town began with fund-raising letters to the party faithful earlier this year from the county's powerful Republican chairman, Joseph N. Mondello, and from individual council members. The letters stressed that whatever the county's budget problems, ''Hempstead Town is one of the best managed municipalities in New York State.'' The letters went on to credit Hempstead Town Republicans for a $50 million budget surplus, the highest credit rating of any town on Long Island and only one town property tax increase in the last nine years.</p>
        <p>Distancing the town Republicans from county Republicans -- most notably the county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta -- was the goal, since the county's bond rating teeters on the verge of junk status and it is threatened with takeover by a state financial control board just days before the election.</p>
        <p>Over the summer, the party sent out five mailings in each of the council districts to tout the town's record and urge residents to vote Republican. Party officials said they expect to send a total of 12 mailings in each district before the election. Some candidates also sent out their own flyers and letters.</p>
        <p>More unusual, the local party aired three television commercials for 10 weeks during the summer.</p>
        <p>One commercial had a man holding up Newsday and saying, ''When you read what's happening in Nassau County, you appreciate what a great job Republicans have done in Hempstead Town.'' A mailing from Councilman Anthony J. Santino of East Rockaway said: ''Don't be confused. Hempstead is NOT Nassau County!! Hempstead Town has never been in better financial shape.''</p>
        <p>Other pleas have been more subtle, not naming the county, but touting the town's sound financial footing and the fiscal responsibility of town Republicans. The mantra in the television ads and in many of the political mailings is: ''Hempstead Republicans. Keeping the trust.''</p>
        <p>The Republicans plainly intend not only to hang on to the three seats it holds on the council but also hope to win back the three seats now held by Democrats. Mr. Santino said that many Republicans last year voted Democratic to send a message. ''We didn't do enough to counteract the daily pummeling of the county situation and explain that Hempstead is a very different story,'' he said. ''But we're certainly not going to let that happen again. We want to bring those people back home.''</p>
        <p>Democrats complain that Republican town officials have even used town resources to further their campaign, citing posters at parks and logos on town mailings that hammer on the same themes: ''Best Wall Street Bond Rating,'' ''Budget Surplus'' and ''Stable Taxes.''</p>
        <p>''They're going all out to say, 'We are not the county,' '' said Rita Kestenbaum of Bellmore, one of the three Democrats elected to the council last year. ''But that's false information because they're all the same people.''</p>
        <p>She and other Democrats note that despite a well-publicized rift between Mr. Mondello and Mr. Gulotta, the ties between town and county are many. Mr. Mondello, for example, is chairman of both the county and town Republican committees. Mr. Santino is the executive assistant to Mr. Mondello. Another councilman, Curtis E. Fisher of Baldwin, is a deputy to Mr. Gulotta.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kestenbaum said the minority status of the Democrats had been keenly felt, going back even before she and her colleagues took office when Supervisor Guardino tried to place the Democrats in offices on a different floor from him and the Republican council members.</p>
        <p>Even when it comes to something as mundane as a town certificate honoring a local businessman or community group, Ms. Kestenbaum said, the Democrats get short-changed. She said she frequently went to ribbon cuttings and store openings where she was told she cannot present a certificate, only to find a Republican council member arriving with a certificate in hand.</p>
        <p>''It's a very silly and petty thing,'' she said. ''But it's important to the job of being a councilwoman because it gets your name in the local paper and it gets you good will.''</p>
        <p>Such incidents are proof of the hazards of one-party rule, she said. But the council Republicans said  their Democratic colleagues just hadn't been around long enough to figure out how things work.</p>
        <p>''My sense is, my Democratic friends have a hard time understanding the process and understanding how to govern,'' said Joseph J. Kearney, a lawyer from Garden City who has been on the council since 1989.</p>
        <p>He said that while the two sides agreed on many issues, they clearly held different views on spending and the town budget. The Democrats, for example, tried unsuccessfully to give town dollars to some social service agencies that had lost their county funding.</p>
        <p>''It would have been fiscally irresponsible to do that in the middle of a budget year, and it would have put us headed into the same fiscal demise as the county's in,'' Mr. Kearney said.</p>
        <p>But Dorothy L. Goosby, a Democratic councilwoman from Hempstead and the lead plaintiff in the federal lawsuit that led to the new council districts, said she found all the talk of sound financial planning tiresome, especially in light of complaints from her minority constituents about poor service from the town.</p>
        <p>''They keep bragging on all the money the town has, thinking that'll get them re-elected,'' she said of her Republican colleagues. ''But people are not happy with the way things are. Parts of the town are more neglected than others, and you can see parks with no swings and equipment at the water plant that's obsolete. There's no long-range planning.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats will base their campaign on the need to end machine politics in Hempstead. Their chances would be slim based on party registration, as their votes are concentrated in Ms. Goosby's minority district and Republicans outnumber Democrats three to two in the five other districts.</p>
        <p>But this year, the Democrats can count on the county's fiscal problems staying in the public eye during prime campaign season as the state financial authority reviews Mr. Gulotta's efforts to find $143 million worth of budget cuts and tax increases for 2001. The authority will decide next month whether to step in and take over the county's finances.</p>
        <p>They are also buoyed by the fact that Democrats traditionally vote in higher numbers in a presidential election year and hope that a strong showing for Al Gore's will help Hempstead Democrats.</p>
        <p>The Democrats will obviously be far outspent in the campaign. The county Republican Party ended the last election season with $2 million in the bank and has since raised significantly more; party officials won't say how much. Nor will they say how much they have received from the state Republican organization.</p>
        <p>However heavy the party's coffers, Mr. Mondello has said he was willing to empty them to hang on to Hempstead Town. County Republican officials say they've spent $1 million already, far exceeding the $600,000 they spent all last year, when there were twice as many local races on the ballot as this year. The Democrats, on the other hand, spent less than $10,000 on all three Hempstead races last year and have virtually no money in their accounts.</p>
        <p>''We can't match them dollar for dollar,'' said Peter Ruffner, the Democratic town leader in Hempstead, ''but we'll beat them the old-fashioned way, going door-to-door, greeting people at train stations and supermarkets.'' He also said that while the state Democratic committee had said it could not offer financial help, it had promised to bring in Democratic notables like Hillary Clinton and Senator Charles E. Schumer to help the council candidates campaign. The town candidates will also get mentioned in mailings of candidates for the State Legislature.</p>
        <p>''Everything is not dollars and cents,'' Mr. Ruffner said. ''If it was, the Republicans wouldn't have gotten creamed last November.''</p>
        <p>Thomas P. DiNapoli of Thomaston, a state Assemblyman and Nassau Democratic Party chairman, said that while Democrats appeared to be finally getting a foothold in what was once rock-solid Republican territory, ''we're still very much the underdogs.''</p>
        <p>But he added that in some ways, the Republicans' campaigning might wind up helping the Democrats.</p>
        <p>''It lets people know there are local races, for one thing,'' he said. ''And for years, the Republicans taught people to vote the straight party ticket by saying we all work as a team, and now for them to say we're not a team really because we're not like them at the county, I don't think people are buying it.''</p>
        <p>After insisting that they not be identified, some Democratic leaders admit that they may not have the strongest field of candidates in Hempstead. Since Republicans have controlled local politics for so long, few Democrats have been able to establish themselves politically. There are the three one-year incumbents, Ms. Goosby, Ms. Kestenbaum and N. Scott Banks, a lawyer from West Hempstead who will run against Mr. Kearney, the 11-year Republican incumbent. The other Democratic candidates include Eleanor Sciglibaglio, a longtime Valley Stream school board member; Jerry Lamonica, a professional photographer and a past director of the Oceanside Chamber of Commerce; and Viki DeJong, a longtime Democratic activist from Westbury.</p>
        <p>On the Republican side, only two incumbents, Mr. Kearney and Mr. Santino, are running. Mr. Fisher lives in the same district as Mr. Santino and briefly considered moving and running in Ms. Goosby's district, where he is originally from. Ms. Goosby's opponent will be Gerald G. Wright, an attorney from Lakeview.</p>
        <p>As a sign of how serious the Republican Party is about the town, party officials persuaded James Darcy, a state Assemblyman from Valley Stream, to give up his state seat to run for the town position. If elected, his pay would be cut from the $79,500 he earned in Albany to the $47,500 the town council job pays.</p>
        <p>To run against Ms. Kestenbaum, the party chose Angelina M. Cullin, the town's elected tax collector, a position once held by Mr. D'Amato. Their final candidate is Gary A. Hudes, a former councilman who lost in last year's election, to run against Ms. DeJong.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rosenbaum, the political scientist from Hofstra, said the Republicans clearly felt they could not afford to lose Hempstead.</p>
        <p>''At the local level, leaders are simply protecting their turf because it's their only source of livelihood,'' he said. ''But the local and state organizations are of course also interested in bringing back the Republican rank and file voters who deserted last year, because without them the organization that has always delivered Republican votes for county, state and presidential elections ceases to exist. And they can't let that happen.''</p>
