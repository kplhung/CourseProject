        <p>THE critic Whitney Balliett once wrote that jazz is ''the sound of surprise.'' A performance by the jazz pianist Uri Caine and his ensemble at the recent San Sebastian Jazz Festival here bore out Mr. Balliett's point. The ensemble performed Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations, a work consisting of 30 inventive treatments of one theme for solo keyboard.  Mr. Caine used the piece as a jumping-off point, interspersing his own concoctions for horns, strings, a DJ and a choir with some of the original Bach variations.</p>
        <p>Throughout the concert, Coro Easo, a local boys choir, stood meekly behind the jazz players, singing cantatas and canons typical of Bach. Near the end of the performance, the sopranos in the choir suddenly raised their subdued voices into slurred, rowdy shouts, befitting a tavern sing-along. Mr. Caine was making explicit what Bach had implied. In his final variation, Bach had buried the melodies of two 18th-century drinking songs within his piano score. In Mr. Caine's ''interpretation,'' which he calls ''The Drinking Party,'' Bach's subtle reference became the boisterous sound of tipsy cherubs storming a concert hall with song.</p>
        <p>Surprise is at the core of Mr. Caine's aesthetic. ''The Drinking Party'' wasn't his only reimagining of the classical repertory. His performances at the festival included Mahler infused with klezmer and free jazz, Wagner scaled down to chamber settings and Schumann replete with spoken-word poetry. A man of ideas, Mr. Caine may be best described as an interpretive musicologist. He mines compositions for musical metaphors -- as was the case with ''The Drinking Party'' -- and for other glimmers of meaning from a composer's life and oeuvre. He then toys with those pieces of information as if they were part of a parlor game, and via a panoply of musical styles, he creates radically different readings.</p>
        <p>For example, on his recently released recording of the ''Goldberg'' Variations, dance forms used by Bach like the gigue become the tango or mambo that Mr. Caine hears on the streets near his apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Bach's Baroque religiosity is reinterpreted through the gospel stylings of the vocalist Barbara Walker. A chromatic piece by Bach is contrasted with textural electronics, including a sample by DJ Olive of a Tibetan singer soaring over the jagged and dense piano harmony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Caine, 45, uses the classical tradition as a springboard to improvisation. ''I'm coming at classical compositions from the jazz perspective, where you take a standard and somehow transform it in the way Charlie Parker would work with an Irving Berlin song,'' he said at his hotel in San Sebastian. ''As a composer I can choose a particular slant to a composition and then use improvisers for different strategies -- going against the original material or exaggerating the material or having material stand as something to be soloed against.''</p>
        <p>He is not the first jazz musician to explore the classical tradition. Duke Ellington's big band jazz from the 1930's was rich in classical motifs. The composer Gunther Schuller formalized the confluence of jazz and classical music when he coined the term ''third stream'' in 1957. For decades, institutions like the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston have been producing classically trained, jazz-savvy musicians. Today, such stylistic fluidity is a hallmark of the downtown scene, where Mr. Caine has worked extensively with the clarinetist Don Byron and the trumpeter Dave Douglas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Caine's reworkings are radically different from the kind of the cut-and-paste postmodernism that is prevalent among other avant-gardists. His classical adaptations build new works from seemingly minor details in the originals in the same way that the film director Peter Greenaway created ''Prospero's Books'' out of ''The Tempest.'' (Mr. Caine's recordings are called ''audio films'' by his label, the German-based Winter and Winter.)</p>
        <p>HE traces his eclecticism to his musical beginnings. He grew up in a broad-minded, intellectual family in Philadelphia: his father was a law professor at Temple and his mother was a poet and professor at Drexel. For four years while a teenager, Mr. Caine received lessons in jazz and classical piano from the French pianist Bernard Pfeiffer. And while studying composition and performance at the University of Pennnsylvania, he rounded out his jazz education playing in clubs in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>''My approach to music is something that's very natural to me because as a pianist I've had the chance to play all sorts of styles,'' he said. ''All this classical music that I'm playing now is music that I knew when I was 15 or 16. I might be naive in saying this, but I don't feel that I'm overwhelmed by that knowledge.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Caine moved to New York in the late 80's, he concentrated on jazz, as is apparent on his mid-90's recordings ''Sphere Music'' and ''Toys,'' dedicated to Thelonious Monk and Herbie Hancock respectively. But a piece based on Mahler's First Symphony on ''Toys'' portended his large-scale classical reworkings. The first of these came when the record producer Stefan Winter commissioned Mr. Caine to create a musical accompaniment for a documentary about Mahler's life. Mr. Caine spent a year poring over Mahler manuscripts and biographies, including the definitive ones by Henry-Louis de la Grange.</p>
        <p>In Mr. la Grange's writings, Mr. Caine read about Mahler's chance encounter and impromptu jam session with a cantor in Prague. ''I read something like that and know exactly what it would sound like as a musical idea,'' he said. On the 1997 recording ''Primal Light,'' Mr. Caine used the cantor Aaron Bensouusan and free jazz-tinged klezmer to bring out Mahler's struggle with his Jewish identity and conversion to Christianity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Caine cites Glenn Gould's 1955 recording of the ''Goldberg'' Variation as an inspiration for his reworkings of the piece. He likens the swinging, propulsive quality of the Gould interpretation to a jazz sensibility, and that similarity became apparent during a performance at San Sebasitan.</p>
        <p>Jazz groups usually begin a tune with a head, or melody, and gain momentum as they run that statement through intricate modifications. Mr. Caine's ensemble took the basic theme from the Bach work and  improvised far-flung variations on it, as naturally as a jazz band would solo over chord changes on a standard.</p>
        <p>Absorbing a Caine concert can be an exhausting if exhilarating experience. His stylistic breadth makes for challenging listening, but his command of wide-ranging styles and music history allow him to deftly translate classical compositions into modern settings. For example, Schumann's ''Dichterliebe'' (''A Poet's Love,'' Op. 48) called for more interaction between the vocalist and pianist than had previous song-cycles of its type. In his interpretation, ''Love's Fugue,'' Mr. Caine transferred the Schumann composition's vocal and piano dialogue to an exchange between his own piano and David Gilmore's softly inflected guitar. Their conversation recalled the subtle jazz duets of the guitarist Jim Hall and the pianist Bill Evans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Caine says the overwrought Romantic poetry of Heinrich Heine, which Schumann set to music, ''could sound like Hallmark poetry to a modern sensibility.''</p>
        <p>''So in many ways it might not have worked,'' he said. ''Instead I went for more of the feeling of the song-cycle, which is heartbreaking, but very erotic also. I was trying to go for the poet's love.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Caine puts Heine's poetry into plain English for a singer with lines like ''You know you want me'' or ''I hurt so deep.'' These lyrics, as interpreted by Mark Ledford, smack of today's pop songs. For more lofty yearnings, the poets Julie Patton, Mariko Takahashi and Shulamith Wechter Caine (Mr. Caine's mother) read their love poems with the music.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, both classical and jazz critics are recognizing Mr. Caine's work as ingenious. It is the kind of dubious distinction often meted out to a jazz musician trying to adapt a classical repertory. Such criticism ignores Mr. Caine's considerable talent as a musician. Ralph Peterson, a drummer who worked with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers and who plays in Mr. Caine's trio, points to the pianist's often overlooked versatility. ''A lot of people have not recognized Uri as a killer straightahead jazz player, which he was long before he did the Mahler and Bach projects,'' he said. Mr. Caine's solo set at the Museo de San Telmo cloister in San Sebastian encapsulated a history of jazz piano. He plowed through ragtime, stride, bebop and the free-jazz gospel of the pianist Don Pullen.</p>
        <p>BUT simply playing well isn't enough for today's avant-gardists to gain recognition.  They must also be conceptualists. Mr. Caine's supple playing and high-minded reinterpretations reflect Samuel Coleridge's assertion that ''genius of the highest kind'' involves the power to modify or transform an old work into something entirely new. On Mr. Caine's  ''Goldberg'' Variations recording, he follows up the closing aria with Danny Blume's ''Eternal Variation,'' an umbral, electronically processed rendition of the of the Bach work. Mr. Caine's unanticipated coda suggests a new possibility in the original: that the variations could be infinite.</p>
        <p>Backstage after the San Sebastian performance of Mr. Caine's Variations, one of the Coro Easo singers came over to me with a bottle of beer in hand, and asked, ''We got it right, the drinking song, didn't we?'' His anxiety about the performance, however, was entirely beside the point. The original full title of the ''Goldberg'' Variations was ''Keyboard Practice, Part IV. Composed for music lovers to refresh their spirits.'' As a jazz musician, Mr. Caine thrives on the practice of inspired variation.</p>
