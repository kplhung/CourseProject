        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>ROBERT KENNEDY: His Life, by Evan Thomas. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $28.) A fresh, judicious and thorough look at the subject by a Newsweek editor; among its conclusions are that Robert Kennedy did not have an affair with Marilyn Monroe, and that he knew about, if he did not personally order, C.I.A.-Mafia plots to kill Fidel Castro.</p>
        <p>AN OBEDIENT FATHER, by Akhil Sharma. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $23.) The main narrator in this novel by a New York investment banker is a low, corrupt functionary in the Delhi school system. It's easy to brand him despicable because he is, but his power to do ill is limited, his personality complex and his author compassionate.</p>
        <p>I LOVED YOU ALL, by Paula Sharp. (Hyperion, $23.95.) An old-fashioned storytelling novel about the escalating defiance of hard-line anti-abortionists in the 1970's; the leading character (on the side that is clearly not the author's) has the depth and energy to become indispensable to people whose lives or children are out of control.</p>
        <p>ROPE BURNS: Stories From the Corner, by F. X. Toole. (Ecco/ HarperCollins, $23.) Stories about boxing and boxers, mainly elegiac, mostly told with cool narrative and wild sentimentalism; the author is a 70-year-old former boxer, trainer and corner man who knows whereof.</p>
        <p>BLOOD OF THE LIBERALS, by George Packer. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $26.) Liberalism, under one or another definition, is the force that shaped and eventually failed the author's grandfather (a congressman from Alabama), his father (a legal scholar and student of procedure) and himself (once a Peace Corps volunteer, now a writer).</p>
        <p>FALSE PAPERS, by Andre Aciman. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $23.) A product of mystical cities -- Alexandria (Egypt), Paris, New York -- Aciman in this memoir attempts to explore and examine his own cast of mind in time and space, what he calls ''perpetual oscillation'' between wherever he is and somewhere else he would invariably rather be.</p>
        <p>ARMING AMERICA: The Origins of a National Gun Culture, by Michael A. Bellesiles. (Knopf, $30.) A historian finds that far from packing old Betsy everywhere to defend their freedoms, Americans before the Civil War were averse to gun ownership; guns cost more than they were worth.</p>
        <p>THE LILY THEATER: A Novel of Modern China, by Lulu Wang. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $25.) A sprawling, fictionalized account of the author's own childhood during China's Cultural Revolution; a daughter of professionals sent to be re-educated in Maoism, she acquired an honest schooling from other learned inmates of the camp.</p>
        <p>THE BLACKWATER LIGHTSHIP, by Colm Toibin. (Scribner, $24.) Three generations of an Irish family are summoned to a clash of old views with new in this novel whose immediate crisis concerns a gay man's death from AIDS but which looks back to some earlier Ireland in which gay consciousness and central heating were equally unknown.</p>
