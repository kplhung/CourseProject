        <p>IT seemed like a good idea at the time.</p>
        <p>After the death of John F. Kennedy Jr. last summer, the sculptor David Lewis felt that Mr. Kennedy should be honored along with his father. So in August, Mr. Lewis unveiled a proposed $300,000 sculpture of the two, to be placed in Hyannis, Mass.</p>
        <p>The town council of Barnstable, in which Hyannis is located, gave its approval. So did the Kennedy family. But last week, the project was put on hold. For although the president died when his son was barely 3 years old, the sculpture depicted them both as adults. It was a historical anachronism that many residents felt was in poor taste.</p>
        <p>Artistic merits aside, one never knows when public art is going to give offense.  Witness the current debate over the proposed statue of Frank Sinatra that may be installed amid the chaos of Times Square.  Objections have been raised to Eric Fischl's idealized nude representation of Arthur Ashe recently displayed at the National Tennis Center in Flushing, N.Y. A 35-foot-tall statue of Catherine of Braganza, wife of Charles II of England and the regal namesake of Queens County, N.Y., has yet to be erected in that borough thanks to charges that she had ties to the slave trade.</p>
        <p>Finally there was the director David Lynch's contribution to CowParade New York 2000, the herd of 500 decorated fiberglass cows that dotted the city this summer.  Mr. Lynch decapitated one of the synthetic cows, hollowed it out, filled it with simulated blood and intestines, impaled its haunches with knives and forks and scrawled ''Eat My Fear'' on its body. When the parade's organizers declined the offering, a minor cause celebre ensued.</p>
        <p>''It's extraordinarily difficult to put work up in a public sphere these days,'' said Erika Doss, author of ''Spirit Poles and Flying Pigs: Public Art and Cultural Democracy in American Communities'' (Smithsonian Institution Press, 1995). ''You have so many tensions among so many factions.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Doss cited the rancorous debate over whether the 1997 Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial in Washington should depict the president's physical infirmities and his trademark cigarette holder (He was eventually depicted with his wheelchair barely visible and without a cigarette). ''I see us at an impasse about understanding what a monument or a memorial is all about,'' she said. ''We've got road rage; now I think we have art rage.''</p>
        <p>That rage has been around for some time. Who can forget Richard Serra's ''Tilted Arc,'' which cut an oppressive 120-foot swath through Federal Plaza in downtown Manhattan in the 1980's? Or the statue of the actor Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa that graced the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art until popular outcry forced its relocation to a local sports complex?</p>
        <p>Even though many public art installations, including the Kennedy sculpture, are financed with private donations, ''As soon as you put anything outdoors, it doesn't matter if taxpayer dollars aren't involved,'' said Alex Baker, a former associate curator of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia. ''People will still argue on the basis of having to pass it every day.''</p>
        <p>Susan Freedman, president of the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit group in New York, also cites the fallout from last fall's ''Sensation'' exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, which featured a painting of the Virgin Mary decorated with balls of elephant dung. ''There's obviously a heightened suspicion,'' she said. ''There's a conservatism out there.''</p>
        <p>I N such an environment, sensitivities can easily outpace aesthetic concerns. Those who complain that the 14-foot Arthur Ashe statue does not look like its honoree might heed this statement from the Unites States Tennis Association: ''The sculpture is not a depiction of Arthur, it is a representation honoring his legacy and memory. We believe the sculpture embodies the qualities of Ashe, dignity, powerful determination and uncommon grace.''</p>
        <p>And according to Lynne Poyant, executive director of the Hyannis Area Chamber of Commerce, the Kennedy project was meant to be a poetic, not literal, homage to father and son. Ms. ''We would have had signage to indicate this does not represent the two in this time together,'' Ms. Poyant said.</p>
        <p>How, then, to separate the tacky from the tasteful?</p>
        <p>''It's a very iffy game,'' Ms. Doss said. ''Projects can fall apart at the last minute.'' In 1991, the artist John Ahearn installed life-size sculptures of three denizens of his devastated South Bronx community. The approval process among various municipal agencies had taken years. But the sculptures were removed only days after they went up after two city employees objected to what they felt were its renderings of racial stereotypes.</p>
        <p>But ''Cast the Sleeping Elephant,'' a gift from three African countries that was installed in the United Nations garden in 1998, succeeded despite potential disaster. When a red-faced U.N. official found that the four-ton bronze casting of an actual pachyderm was anatomically correct, ficus trees were ordered in to cover its nether regions.</p>
        <p>''They rolled out the trees on the day it was unveiled,'' recalled Myrna Baron, a publicist. ''The sculptor, Mihail, took it in good humor. He said this was an example of man trying to control nature.''</p>
