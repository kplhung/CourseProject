        <p>Columbia tailback Johnathan Reese rushed for 172 yards and 2 touchdowns and quarterback Jeff McCall threw for three scores and ran for another as the Lions defeated Fordham, 43-26, in their season opener last night at Wien Stadium. It was the most points for Columbia since a 44-0 victory over Fordham in 1972.</p>
        <p>Columbia outscored the Rams, 22-0, in the second half, as Reese and the offensive line dominated.</p>
        <p>Columbia put the game away midway through the fourth quarter. On fourth-and-3 from the Fordham 23, McCall hit flanker Jarel Cockburn on a perfect hitch-and-go pattern for the final touchdown.</p>
        <p>Columbia got off to a hot start in a wild first half. Using a mix of short passes to the wide receivers and Reese's bruising running, it took the opening kickoff and marched 54 yards for a touchdown on McCall's 5-yard scramble.</p>
        <p>Fordham (1-2) answered immediately, traveling 71 yards in eight plays to tie the score at 7-7. Alemayo Whyte dived in from the 1-yard line three plays after quarterback Mike Mucci connected with tight end Chris Harris for a 36-yard gain.</p>
        <p>After Columbia punted on its next possession, the Fordham offense went to work again, marching 50 yards in nine plays. Tailback Arthur Gaskin sprinted untouched up the middle for a 9-yard touchdown, making the score 14-7.</p>
        <p>The key play of the drive was a 10-yard run by Gaskin on third-and-1 on which he broke a tackle by Columbia's Kirby Mack in the backfield and scampered around right end to get the first down.</p>
        <p>Columbia came right back, however. McCall connected with wide receiver Doug Peck on a 23-yard touchdown pass, with Peck leaping over defensive back Justin Logan to make an acrobatic catch and tie the score at 14-14.</p>
        <p>Fordham fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and the Lions took advantage on the next play. McCall hit Cockburn on a wide receiver screen pass -- the Lions' fifth of the half -- and Cockburn took it 11 yards for a touchdown.</p>
        <p>But Fordham scored the last 12 points of the half. On the Rams' next possession, Kirwin Watson plunged off tackle for a 2-yard touchdown. Brian Colsant missed the extra-point kick but made up for it by connecting on field goals of 34 and 40 yards before halftime, giving Fordham a 26-21 lead.</p>
        <p>''I thought we moved the ball well all day, but we just couldn't stop anybody in the first half,'' Columbia Coach Ray Tellier said. ''In the second half, we got a couple of stops early on and we were able to continue what we were doing on offense as well.''</p>
        <p>Columbia scored on its first possession of the second half. Reese's 9-yard touchdown run culminated an 80-yard drive that gave the Lions a 29-26 lead after the 2-point conversion.</p>
        <p>The Lions struck again four minutes later. After an interception by free safety Phil Murray, Reese accounted for all 30 yards of Columbia's fifth touchdown march and scored on a 1-yard dive.</p>
