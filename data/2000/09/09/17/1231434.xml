        <p>The first season of the new millennium could go down in the history books as the season in which parity met disparity.</p>
        <p>Probably the most discussed and debated topic besides the baseball itself has been payroll disparity, how a handful of wealthy, big-spending teams have taken control of Major League Baseball and dominate the spots available for postseason play. Teams below the top 10 in payroll need not apply.</p>
        <p>When no one was looking, however, an intriguing development popped up. All 30 teams could finish this season closer together than ever. With two weeks left in the season, it's conceivable that all of the teams could finish with won-lost percentages under .600 and over .400. That kind of finish has never occurred.</p>
        <p>Lou Piniella, the Seattle manager, wasn't aware that history might be in the making a few weeks ago when he said: ''There seems to be more parity than before. There's a lot of parity in baseball; there really is. Teams can all beat you. I don't think there's a place you can go and find you can take a breather.''</p>
        <p>When the .400 to .600 possibility was brought to the attention of Commissioner Bud Selig, he said: ''There probably is greater parity. I would think it's due to the dilution factor because of the two expansions.''</p>
        <p>Every team right now is over .400, everyone under .600. The Chicago White Sox (.599) and the San Francisco Giants (.596 before their game last night) are at the top end, the Chicago Cubs (.405) at the low end.</p>
        <p>The major leagues came closest to the .400 to .600 range in 1958, when only the Washington Senators among the 16 teams finished out of that range. With a .396 percentage in the 154-game season, the Senators could have joined the other 15 teams if they had gained one additional victory, finishing with 62 instead of 61.</p>
        <p>Four other seasons ended with one team beyond the .400 to .600 range, the White Sox in 1959, the Detroit Tigers in '68 and '84, and the Oakland Athletics in '90.</p>
        <p>Last season's final records offered no previews of coming attractions. Two National League teams (Atlanta and Arizona) and one in the American (Yankees) finished with more than 97 victories (97-65 produces a .599 percentage) and one N.L. and two A.L. teams had sub-.400 records, or 64 victories or fewer.</p>
        <p>Doug Melvin, the Texas general manager, speculated on the development that has overtaken this season. The higher-paid teams, the ones that might be expected to play .600 or better, he said, might not be as well rounded as might be expected. ''If 20 percent of your roster makes 80 percent of your payroll, it still doesn't mean you're going to have a good team,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At the other end, he said, less-talented teams pick up players that wealthier teams aren't patient enough to keep, and they develop into productive players. He cited Kansas City as an example, mentioning the contributions Jermaine Dye, Joe Randa and Mac Suzuki have made to the Royals' rise from their closing .398 percentage last season.</p>
        <p>Allard Baird of the Royals was among the general managers who suggested that the shortage of competent pitching could be at the root of the development. Gerry Hunsicker of Houston also cited the shortage as a factor. Even contending teams, he said, have pitching problems.</p>
        <p>''Very few contenders don't have pitching problems,'' he said. ''Pitching is still the cornerstone of a successful baseball team. It's becoming more and more difficult to put together a good pitching staff. Part of it is a lack of talent and part is that the smaller ballparks favor hitters.''</p>
        <p>But Ron Schueler of the White Sox said he wasn't ready to subscribe to the parity theory.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure I buy that,'' he said. ''Look at Cleveland and New York. Both had at least a month where they weren't healthy. We definitely caught the Yankees at the right time, when they were thin. We caught Cleveland when they had injuries and were thin. I think it's getting closer, but I think this season injuries have played a greater role. The Yankees are definitely a .600 club. Cleveland would be right there, too. We wouldn't be looking at an eight-game lead.''</p>
        <p>Yet Schueler added: ''I think everybody in our division is getting better. Kansas City is a dangerous club. If they spend money on a couple starters, they could get better in a hurry.''</p>
        <p>If baseball has indeed reached parity, how does that mix with the payroll disparity the owners say has become the sport's biggest problem?</p>
        <p>''I think there's more parity,'' Selig said, ''but the power of the payroll is the primary factor. Payrolls in the end still take over.''</p>
        <p>In other words, even in the context of a shrinking range of won-lost records, the teams with the highest payrolls will still be at the upper end, the ones that reach the playoffs and are most likely to dominate them, Selig said.</p>
        <p>''Whether the Yankees and the Braves win 58 or 60 or 62 percent of their games is irrelevant,'' he said. ''I'm grateful for teams not being below 40 percent, but does that take away from what we're talking about? No. It's interesting and I can understand the parity matter, but I don't think that's the answer.''</p>
        <p>Although the trend in recent seasons has been for the highest-payroll teams to populate the playoffs, the final eight this season will feature the White Sox, No. 26 in salary at the start of the season, and possibly Oakland, No. 25. Four and possibly five or six of the top 10 won't be there.</p>
        <p>''There may be an aberration from time to time,'' Selig said.</p>
        <p>N.L. Central Is Up for Grabs</p>
        <p>As Gerry Hunsicker said, it's the best race left besides the one for the American League wild-card spot. It's the race for third place in the National League Central. ''And we're all playing each other down the stretch,'' said Hunsicker, the Houston general manager.</p>
        <p>Three games separated four teams when the weekend series began Thursday night, so the top spot in the rest of the division is ripe for claiming. Will it go to Houston, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh or Chicago?</p>
        <p>''It looks good to finish third,'' said Davey Lopes, the Brewers' rookie manager. ''Our goal is to finish as high as we possibly can and build that momentum going into the new ballpark.''</p>
        <p>While it sounds better to finish third than fourth, fifth or sixth, especially sixth in the only six-team division, Lopes acknowledged that the won-lost record won't impress anybody. All four teams are assured of a losing record.</p>
        <p>As an indication of the fluidity of the race, the standing this month alone has had the Astros, the Pirates and the Cubs each in third, fourth, fifth and sixth and the Brewers in third and fourth.</p>
        <p>Because Bud Selig operated the Brewers before he was commissioner, the team that finishes third should get as a trophy a pair of old shoes that Selig wore out pacing back and forth in the press box at County Stadium.</p>
        <p>Ex-Indians Are Thriving</p>
        <p>The Cleveland Indians are in New York this weekend, but Sean Casey is in Cincinnati, Brian Giles is in Houston with Pittsburgh and Richie Sexson is in Cincinnati with Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>They are the three young players the Indians have traded for pitching in the last two and a half years, and rare is the team that can afford to relinquish three of the better young hitters in the game.</p>
        <p>Giles is having his second outstanding season with the Pirates, going into last night's game with a .313 batting average, .431 on-base percentage (fourth in the National League), .598 slugging percentage (10th), 33 home runs and 117 runs batted in (fifth). Casey, who had an outstanding season with the Reds last year, started this season slowly but has recovered and is hitting .300.</p>
        <p>Sexson, new to the N.L. in this second half of the season, has dazzled everyone who has seen him for the first time. He is hitting .307 with 13 home runs and 39 R.B.I., averaging a home run every 12.8 at-bats and an R.B.I. every 4.3 at-bats.</p>
        <p>When the Indians traded Sexson to the Brewers in July, they were desperate for pitching. Bob Wickman has gained 10 saves in 12 chances as their closer, and Jason Bere and Steve Woodard became 40 percent of their starting rotation, joining Dave Burba, who was acquired for Casey in 1998.</p>
        <p>Bere has a 5-3 record and 6.17 earned run average after his loss to the Yankees yesterday. Woodard has struggled to a 1-3 record and has a 7.25 E.R.A. Burba, one of the healthy members of the Indians' injury-plagued starting rotation, has a 15-6 record and a 4.31 E.R.A. Ricardo Rincon, an effective reliever, has hardly represented equal value for Giles, even with his .172 opponents' batting average and record of allowing none of 19 inherited runners to score.</p>
        <p>White Sox Pitchers Ailing</p>
        <p>The White Sox face the possibility of playing in the playoffs without the pitchers who have been their best starters. Cal Eldred (10-2), who has a hairline fracture, had a screw placed in his right elbow 10 days ago. James Baldwin (14-5), who has tendinitis in his right shoulder, got a cortisone shot a week ago. General Manager Ron Schueler said he didn't know what to expect from either one.</p>
        <p>''Eldred is like a little kid who found a new toy,'' Schueler said. ''He was done for this year. But now I think he has an opportunity. He didn't have any pain when he threw the other day. But we don't know whether he'll be able to pitch.''</p>
        <p>Of Baldwin, Schueler said: ''We're not big on giving shots. He wanted one. We'll rest him, give him one more chance. If his arm responds, he'll pitch. If not, we'll go without him.''</p>
