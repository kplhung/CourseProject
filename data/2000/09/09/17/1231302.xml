        <p>For six years, readers from across the city went to Blackout Books at 50 Avenue B in search of volumes like ''Bakunin on Anarchism'' and zines like ''Black Flag'' and ''Slingshot.'' The small, cluttered store, on the ground floor of a walkup between East Third and East Fourth Streets, was also a place where neighbors gathered to post and read fliers or  talk over local issues.</p>
        <p>But this summer, according to members of the anarchist collective that runs Blackout Books, the store's landlord, Howard Lifshitz, said that in September the rent would rise from $1,125 to $1,500, more than the group could afford.

        <p>For six years, readers from across the city went to Blackout Books at 50 Avenue B in search of volumes like ''Bakunin on Anarchism'' and zines like ''Black Flag'' and ''Slingshot.'' The small, cluttered store, on the ground floor of a walkup between East Third and East Fourth Streets, was also a place where neighbors gathered to post and read fliers or  talk over local issues.</p>
        <p>But this summer, according to members of the anarchist collective that runs Blackout Books, the store's landlord, Howard Lifshitz, said that in September the rent would rise from $1,125 to $1,500, more than the group could afford. While the two dozen members of the collective began looking for a new space, they  started packing up their inventory.</p>
        <p>On the afternoon of Aug. 31, some of them met at the store to finish moving out and make way for the Hare Krishna branch that was expanding into the space.</p>
        <p>Earlier that week they had transferred most of the bookstore's contents to local spots like ABC No Rio, a cultural center on Rivington Street, and Soft Skull Shortwave, an independent bookstore on Norfolk Street, where Blackout Books was given a shelf. Collective members said they were saddened to be leaving Avenue B.</p>
        <p>''We made available books that were hard to get elsewhere,'' said Tanya Solomon, a longtime member. ''We supported small presses, and the people who worked here were like a family.''</p>
        <p>The conversations that took place in the shop were often political. Protests were planned there, and some local political  groups trace their origins to discussions that began casually in Blackout Books.</p>
        <p>After clearing the storefront, workers  swept the floor clean. All that remained was a placard taped to the window that read, ''Don't mourn, organize.'' This was a shortened version of what the the Wobbly  organizer Joe Hill wrote in 1915 just before his execution in Utah.</p>
        <p>A few hours after the cleanup, as the sun began to set, a crowd of several dozen gathered on Avenue B to pay their final respects. Some in the throng scattered bogus $10,000 bills, then ignited a cardboard replica of a dollar sign.</p>
        <p>Two men used bolt cutters to take down the wooden store sign hanging from the facade. As a man and a woman playing a trumpet and a horn struck up a dirge, several others hefted the long sign onto their shoulders. The rest of the crowd fell in behind.</p>
        <p>Then, without a backward glance, the procession began marching somberly down Avenue B.</p>
        <p>By Friday, Blackout still had not found a new store site, but promised to put updates on its Web site, www.panix.com/blackout/.</p>
