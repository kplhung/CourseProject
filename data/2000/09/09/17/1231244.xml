        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a suburban mother of two boys, I read with interest the short essay ''Encounter on the Subway'' by Herbert Hadad [Sept. 10]. It describes a few moments of people watching on the Lexington Avenue subway. The writer's focus was on the interactions of a 3-year-old son in a stroller (''a beautiful, black-eyed boy'' and a ''wonderful creature''), his doting mother (''a plain-looking woman''), his sister (a ''pretty, slender girl of 8 or so'') and a ''beautiful'' female executive in her 40's, who ''was either oblivious to the mother or too taken with her son to notice and continued to deliver to the boy a repertory of flirtation and reverence.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a suburban mother of two boys, I read with interest the short essay ''Encounter on the Subway'' by Herbert Hadad [Sept. 10]. It describes a few moments of people watching on the Lexington Avenue subway. The writer's focus was on the interactions of a 3-year-old son in a stroller (''a beautiful, black-eyed boy'' and a ''wonderful creature''), his doting mother (''a plain-looking woman''), his sister (a ''pretty, slender girl of 8 or so'') and a ''beautiful'' female executive in her 40's, who ''was either oblivious to the mother or too taken with her son to notice and continued to deliver to the boy a repertory of flirtation and reverence.''</p>
        <p>Most striking was the writer's report that, in the course of a few minutes, the boy had slapped his sister ''with the side of his fist'' at least three times and ''looked up at her for a reaction.'' The girl exhibited '' . . . forbearance and a kind of sweet magnanimity.'' No reaction was reported of the mother. The executive shook her head flirtatiously at the boy to indicate that something was not quite right, but went right on cooing. The writer then went on to express the main point, which was a hope that the executive can fulfill her secret wish to have a child.</p>
        <p>This story was billed as one of ''rarefied love.'' Am I missing something? To me, this story shows a need for people -- especially those of all ages in the sister's situation -- to learn respect for themselves and for others.</p>
