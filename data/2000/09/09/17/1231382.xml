        <p>Howell Raines Editorial Observer column on the surprisingly warm reception that Sen Joseph I Lieberman, Democratic vice presidential nominee, has received from Christians; says fundamentalist and evangelical Protestants and culturally conservative Catholics are more attracted by Lieberman's devoutness than they are put off by doctrinal differences between Christianity and Judaism</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore's selection of Senator Joseph Lieberman as his running mate has significantly undermined the conventional wisdom that vice-presidential candidates don't matter much. That is due in part to the fact that Mr. Lieberman has looked like a bundle of energy in comparison with the leaden presence of Dick Cheney, the former Secretary of Defense, on the Republican ticket.</p>
        <p>But the far more significant contribution by Mr. Lieberman is that he has given the Democratic ticket a kind of moral armor that the party has not enjoyed since Jimmy Carter's first campaign in 1976. With the advent of Ronald Reagan in 1980, religiously conservative Christians flocked to the Republican side and stayed there. Mr. Lieberman is pulling some of those voters back, confounding predictions that his Orthodox Jewish faith might arouse anti-Semitic feelings.</p>
        <p>What has happened instead is that many fundamentalist and evangelical Protestants and culturally conservative Catholics are more attracted by Mr. Lieberman's devoutness than they are put off by doctrinal differences between Christianity and Judaism. What this amounts to is a new Democratic purchase on that category of voters the strategists call ''people of faith.'' A Democratic pollster said that the party's tracking polls showed a gain of 15 percentage points among self-identified evangelical Christians following Mr. Lieberman's selection and the Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>Another party strategist noted that evangelicals and fundamentalists together make up about a third of likely Protestant voters, and that recent Democratic tickets have gotten a quarter to a third of this combined evangelical-fundamentalist group. In a close election, the difference between a quarter and a third can be critical. ''If a Democrat gets one-third of the evangelical-fundamentalist vote, he's hard to beat,'' this strategist noted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has a track record of pulling conservative Catholics, too. Most analysts agree that his one-point margin of victory over Senator Lowell Weicker in 1988 came from Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, a stronghold of the kind of ethnic Catholic voters who had been Reagan Democrats earlier in the decade. Since Mr. Lieberman joined the Democratic ticket, some of its biggest gains have been in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Louisiana -- states with significant populations of the same kinds of voters.</p>
        <p>No one attributes all of Mr. Gore's gains to Mr. Lieberman's presence. The vice president's convention speech, his success in putting Social Security and Medicare at the center of the debate, his growing aura of confidence and Mr. Bush's gaffes all play a role. But Mr. Lieberman has clearly given ethical, even theological ballast to Mr. Gore's effort to succeed a president widely perceived as, shall we say, situationally religious.</p>
        <p>One reason for Mr. Lieberman's appeal across religious lines is that the rhetoric of conviction employed by religiously conservative Jews and Christians is more similar than secular voters -- and commentators -- realize. In his book, ''In Praise of Public Life,'' Senator Lieberman refers approvingly to the ''great awakenings'' of the 18th and 19th centuries, which were essentially Protestant events, as watersheds in American history.</p>
        <p>The book's cultural commentary uses a vocabulary that would fit easily into a religious-right sermon. Mr. Lieberman, for example, speaks of his ''swelling sense that much of our culture has become toxic, that our standards of decency and civility are being significantly eroded by the entertainment industry's shameless and pervasive promotion of violence, sex and vulgarity, and that the traditional sources of values in our society -- such as faith, family and school -- are in a life and death struggle with the darker forces of immorality, inhumanity and greed.''</p>
        <p>For the time being, secular Democrats, including the big contributors in the entertainment industry, are willing to muffle their complaints about Mr. Lieberman's moralizing. The party is that hungry for victory. But they are worried, and with some reason. For the kind of faith-based cultural populism practiced by Senator Lieberman can veer toward divisiveness, even demagogy. I well remember the rally on Aug. 22, 1980, when Ronald Reagan promised 15,000 members of the Roundtable, a nondenominational evangelical group, that he would govern according to ''old time religion.'' Jimmy Carter, a much more active churchman than Mr. Reagan, never got those voters back.</p>
        <p>But that rally also turned out to be a pivotal event in establishing a two-decade reign of ideological rigidity in the national Republican Party. The religious right soon became so entrenched a force in the G.O.P. that it could dictate the party platform on divisive issues like abortion and school prayer. All that is to say there can be an upside at the polls in the religious appeals that Mr. Lieberman has brought into the Democratic presidential campaign. But there is also a downside risk of unleashing forces that can lead to coercive policies and censorship, alienating secularists and liberals whose votes, and dollars, are still important to the Democrats.</p>
