        <p>CALVIN TRILLIN, one of America's most entertaining humorists and a certified foodie who introduced the world to Kansas City barbecue, says he ''won't eat in any place that's over 100 feet off the ground.'' Generally one should accept Mr. Trillin's sage advice: the higher off the ground you eat, the worse the food.</p>
        <p>But some of London's newest restaurants give the lie to Mr. Trillin's usually accurate observations. Not only do they offer architecturally interesting city views unseen before by tourists or Londoners, but the food is also often quite good, and just as often quite pricey.</p>
        <p>Some of the most exciting vistas did not exist five years ago, about the time Londoners realized they had a beautiful underused river in their midst. What followed was a frenzy of riverside development, particularly on the south bank of the Thames. Today, much of that work is complete and what were once slum and factory warehouses have become thriving neighborhoods of  apartments carved out of former factory buildings, newly built residential spaces, trendy shops as well as restaurants with views. The south bank is also home to the Royal Festival Hall, the Royal National Theater and Shakespeare's Globe Theater. The last time that part of London was so busy Shakespeare was watching his plays performed at the original Globe.</p>
        <p>Redevelopment on the north side of the Thames, the side most visitors know, has also opened up some new vistas, making it possible to walk along the river from its source in Oxfordshire to its mouth.</p>
        <p>If the food served in these restaurants with views, while good, is not the best that London has to offer -- and London's restaurant scene is a hot, happening place these days -- it is more than made up for by the visual treats: the Thames sparkling with reflected city lights at the Blue Print Cafe on the south bank, the bird's eye views of 400 years of architecture from Twentyfour, in the heart of the old city.</p>
        <p>London is finally proud of the way it looks,  and these restaurants, with something interesting to see no matter where you turn, are filled with locals, not tourists.</p>
        <p>Blue Print Cafe</p>
        <p>There is a spectacular view of the Tower of London, one that none of its unfortunate residents ever saw, and of Tower Bridge, from the Blue Print Cafe on Butler's Wharf right above the Design Museum. With a little imagination you can also conjure up the once thriving Billingsgate Fish Market on the other side of the river. Charles II gave the Dutch permission to sail their barges up the Thames with their cargos of eels. The eels were kept alive by the seawater that flowed into the hold.</p>
        <p>So it seemed appropriate to try several traditional fish dishes to start the meal. One delicious salad of smoked eel, roasted potatoes with eggs, and pancetta was topped with a creamy dill and hot mustard sauce; another was a beautifully pickled herring and thinly sliced cucumber served with potatoes, capers and dill dressing. A thoroughly contemporary dish -- roasted eggplant with coriander chutney, much like a pesto -- was as well executed as the two fish appetizers.</p>
        <p>The chef, Jeremy Lee, also did well with monkfish, which was served with a soft  polenta redolent of cheese. He has a good sense of flavorings. And he produced a perfect dish of thinly sliced liver with sage, onions and a very rich red wine sauce.</p>
        <p>Cakes made with polenta have many fans, and I am one of them. The Blue Print Cafe version, with whipped heavy cream that was as thick as Devonshire cream, was very satisfying with its compote of apricots and raisins, all generously splashed with orange liqueur. For those who prefer fruit, the raspberry trifle was much more fruit than cake; the mascarpone was very light, and there wasn't a whiff of sherry to be tasted. Perfect for a warm summer night.</p>
        <p>All the while you are savoring this quite good food in a space that looks like a yacht club -- the only thing missing were the blue blazers and brass buttons -- your eyes can enjoy old London and new. At dusk on the boardwalk below, couples stroll arm in arm, dogs are out for their evening constitutionals. As dusk approaches, Tower Bridge suddenly lights up, and Canary Wharf, off in the opposite direction, is bathed in sunset glow.</p>
        <p>Twentyfour</p>
        <p>London's young lions, glued to their mobile phones and drinking strong cocktails, have taken over this restaurant at the top of the NatWest Tower in the heart of the the City of London, the square-mile financial district that has its own police force. History lies at the feet of the diners. This is where banking began, in the 18th-century coffeehouses. One of the best known was home to Lloyds of London.</p>
        <p>At Twentyfour there is a small but appealing menu of fresh, light cooking. The pea soup was gently suffused with the subtle flavor of the fresh peas and just a hint of mint. A couple of the dishes like the salmon and scallops were well executed but could have done with a bit of salt.</p>
        <p>A perfectly cooked piece of orange tilapia was served on a salad of truffled purple potatoes tied together with a well-balanced citrus vinaigrette. A dish of roast brill and celeriac, a vegetable that tastes a bit like celery and fennel, made an unusually successful pairing with coconut sauce.</p>
        <p>After dining out for five days straight in London, I became an expert on creme brulee, and this version was sublime -- just the right texture, not too soft and not too firm. A pineapple tarte Tatin was perfumed with a deliciously scented ginger ice cream. Even the molten chocolate cake managed to taste new and exciting with its rosemary ice cream.</p>
        <p>The restaurant is around the corner from Threadneedle Street and the Bank of England, and near the Museum of the City of London and the Barbican Arts Center, London home of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Perfect for tourists and for people who have business in the financial district, the heart of skyscraper land.</p>
        <p>Through floor-to-ceiling windows, the newly famous Dome, built for the Millennium, and Canary Wharf are visible from the dining room, and there is a splendid view of the Tower Bridge from the bar. The bar also overlooks the Thames. Not that any of the young lions gives the views more than a passing glance. They are more interested in the interior scene, filled with local masters of the universe.</p>
        <p>The quiet contemporary setting fits the patrons: sophisticated Art Deco design in grays and beiges with comfortable chairs. There is a lot of marble and much polished wood. This place gets 10 out of 10 for styling and has fine, professional service.</p>
        <p>Oxo Tower</p>
        <p>The Millennium Pedestrian Bridge, just completed, leads to the Tate Modern, the new museum on the south bank, and it offers London's only unobstructed view of St. Paul's Cathedral. Unfortunately the bridge had to be closed shortly after its grand opening in May and remains that way while it is re-engineered to reduce the sway. (No date has been set for reopening the bridge; the engineers' report is expected to be delivered in the next two weeks.)</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Oxo Tower, which occupies the rooftop of the Oxo Tower Wharf Building on the south bank, offers the best view of St. Paul's, Christopher Wren's masterpiece. The restaurant also affords marvelous views of Somerset House, once a royal palace and now an art gallery, and of the Savoy, one of the city's most  elegant hotels.</p>
        <p>The tower of the revamped building that houses the restaurant was built to circumvent rules that forbid illuminated advertising along the river. The gaps in the brickwork just happened to spell out Oxo, the name of Britain's well-known cubes of beef extract, and when the lights are turned on, it is clear what is being advertised. The restaurant itself, with its soaring louvered ceiling and blue neon lights, makes you feel as if you are dining in a posh tent. It really doesn't matter if the food doesn't soar like the architecture. It is quite good, if a bit pricey.</p>
        <p>Tender ravioli stuffed with langoustine and topped with ratatouille and deep-fried basil and a delightful pile of succulent fresh salmon with potato confit and avocado and caviar sauce were good starters.</p>
        <p>Poached wild Scottish salmon with fennel was cooked as requested, medium-rare, and was made even more delicious by the lovely light horseradish cream. An assertive roast loin of Welsh lamb played nicely off a creamy smooth polenta cake with just the right amount of Parmigiano-Reggiano and a nicely grilled assortment of vegetables.</p>
        <p>If the weather allows, ask to be served dessert outside. There is nothing as romantic as looking down on the Thames, sparkling with the lights of the bridges and the late Victorian street lights of the Embankment. But even inside, banana chocolate bread pudding with banana ice cream, a light but deeply flavored prune and Armagnac souffle and an unusual lemon rhubarb tart were delightful conclusions to the meal.</p>
        <p>You can easily walk to the restaurant after an evening at the Royal Festival Hall or the Royal National Theater.</p>
        <p>Seven</p>
        <p>If you are going to be in Leicester Square or if you are going to the  theater in the West End, a good place to be is several stories above the square teeming with tourists and performance artists. Seven is set atop a most unlikely looking building with an equally unlikely set of stairs leading to it, but you will be rewarded with what only the birds see when they look down on the square -- leafy green trees and an expanse of green lawn often covered with people hanging out.</p>
        <p>The more distant views offer some of London's best-known landmarks from a different perspective: the brand-new London Eye, the giant Ferris wheel that is the hottest attraction in the city, next to Westminster Bridge; the Houses of Parliament; Westminster Abbey; St. Martin's in the Field and St. Paul's.</p>
        <p>The food is straightforward with many touches of old England. One of the first courses a friend and I chose was salmon and prawns, the salmon served with a light chive cream-cheese mixture, the tiny poached shrimp in a lightly sweetened mayonnaise dressing. Another was a refreshing plate of thinly shaved vegetables with a nice fresh goat cheese, cilantro and a drizzle of olive oil.  Pumpkin risotto was expertly cooked, al dente and creamy, and streaked with the ruby red of balsamic vinegar and verdant green olive oil.</p>
        <p>Two different fish dishes were cooked by a pro: hake and lemon sole simply garnished, the former with beans, the latter with parsley potatoes and broccoli. A lusciously creamy panna cotta was suffused with vanilla and served with berries, and the brandy snap raspberry crisp was a fine mixture of crisp cookie and cold ice cream.</p>
        <p>Seven is an oasis for lunch or dinner, before or after the theater. And it is right on the edge of Regent Street shopping.</p>
        <p>The Bridge</p>
        <p>Before going in for dinner at this ground-level restaurant, have a drink outside on the elevated bar area. It provides a fine view of the river from the north bank that cannot be seen from the restaurant. And when the Millennium Bridge reopens, you will almost be able to see the faces of the pedestrians as they make their way across it.</p>
        <p>What you will see quite clearly is the Tate Modern, which took up residence in May in a former power plant on the south bank. The museum, which is the talk of the town, is now topped with a glass box, and when the Tate projects an occasional light show on the facade, the combination of the webbing of the bridge and the lights are definitely an introduction into cyberworld art.</p>
        <p>Two hundred years ago the area surrounding the restaurant with its maze of narrow little streets was the land of Fagin and Oliver Twist. It was also Jack the Ripper country. Centuries before, the Romans rowed up the Thames to this spot where they debarked because it was the first place they could do so without getting their feet wet.</p>
        <p>It is also an area that has known considerable destruction, both in the Fire of London in 1666 and during the Blitz of World War II. Today it is filled with very expensive apartments and offices with amazing views of London Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge.</p>
        <p>The restaurant with its floor-to-ceiling windows, stone floor and open kitchen is simple and understated. Nothing detracts from the views except some very nice food, like the arugula (called rocket here) and pistachio soup, the slight bitterness of the arugula contrasting with the sweetness of the nuts. Tender and flavorful dim sum are an equally good choice for a starter. There is also a delightful Caesar salad with a  twist of marinated fresh anchovies.</p>
        <p>A classic dish of tender calf's liver was nicely cooked, the bacon crisp, the mashed potatoes with sage butter creamy. Some might prefer a nicely cooked piece of salmon served with coriander and chive crust and flavored with sage butter.</p>
        <p>One of the best desserts I had in London was an elegant and very subtle elderflower-lemon tart served with raspberry sauce and creme fraiche. All the ice creams are good,  but the best is a wickedly creamy mascarpone.</p>
        <p>After lunch or dinner this is a  grand place for a stroll along  the Thames Walk. Go left and  you will run into Tower Bridge or London Bridge.</p>
        <p>Bill of fare</p>
        <p>Reservations are necessary at these restaurants, but many of them will not reserve tables with the finest views. The best way to ensure getting one is to go very early. When calling in London, you must dial zero before the 207 prefix.</p>
        <p>Price estimates are for a three-course meal for two, with a $60 bottle of wine (fine dining in London is expensive) and a service charge of 12.5 percent, at $1.50 to the pound. Menus change regularly. Smoking is permitted in all the restaurants; American Express, Visa and MasterCard are accepted by all, and Diners everywhere but the Bridge.</p>
