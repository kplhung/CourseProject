        <p>PIPERS AT THE GATES OF DAWN</p>
        <p>A Triptych.</p>
        <p>By Lynn Stegner.</p>
        <p>270 pp. Hanover, N.H.:</p>
        <p>University Press</p>
        <p>of New England. $24.95.</p>
        <p>There's something a little intimidating about the word ''triptych.'' Especially where books are concerned. I want to curl up on the couch this weekend with a good triptych? Maybe next time.</p>
        <p>Still, no one can blame Lynn Stegner for choosing this subtitle for ''Pipers at the Gates of Dawn,'' her collection of interlocking novellas set in and around the fictional town of Harrow, Vt. -- a chunk of New England that is somehow reminiscent of both ''Ethan Frome'' and ''On Golden Pond.'' Harrow can be a stark place or a magnificently sun-dappled one, depending on the season, and its citizens display the trademark New England reserve.</p>
        <p>The first such citizen whom we meet is Ray Rinaldi, a moody 17-year-old who's been forced into running his family's dairy farm. Ray's father is an alcoholic who often passes out before he makes it home; Ray's mother, already struggling to raise his six younger brothers and sisters, is pregnant yet again. To help out with the chores, Ray hires a stranger named Sam Chase, but Chase's presence among the Rinaldis -- though fleeting and impersonal -- seems only to worsen their lot.</p>
        <p>In the second novella, Chase goes to work for Dru and Fletcher Hammond III, wealthy summer residents whose dock needs fixing. The Hammonds' marriage, it turns out, is in need of some repair as well, and Dru, a pretty mother of two boys, finds herself increasingly unsettled by this good-looking stranger. Chase also has a disturbing effect on the dying old man in the third (and most forced) of the novellas, a reclusive eccentric who tells his nephew the story of his life and why, while out cutting wood with Chase, he failed to warn him that a chain saw was about to kick back in his face.</p>
        <p>Chase gets around a good deal, but we're told very little about him -- other than that he's well educated, chameleon-like and bears a certain resemblance to Peter Fonda. As Stegner explains in an author's note at the close of the book, this hired man represents ''what I call in-migrants from the global village'' -- another way of saying that he's like a growing number of us who, armed with iMacs and fax machines, can make a home anywhere there's an electrical socket.</p>
        <p>In the same note, Stegner (who is the author of two previous novels) tells us that she's ''interested in community'' and the way it's threatened by technology. But her agenda can get in the way of her storytelling, and Chase is such a flat character that he infects some of the book with his own one-dimensionality. ''You don't belong anywhere,'' Dru Hammond tells him in a fit of fury that, were he not quite such a cardboard figure, would probably make him laugh. ''You have no feelings for humanity,'' she adds. ''You are a cipher, a cosmic goose egg.''</p>
        <p>This same sort of unconvincing talk shows up in other places. When Dru and her husband argue about their marital problems, she quotes Updike (''The expected gift isn't worth giving'') and makes statements like ''Your hostility was palpable last night.'' He comes back at her with huffy verbiage of his own. ''You've got criteria I'm not inclined to meet,'' he tells her during one heated argument. During another, he announces, ''I perseverate.'' I'll say.</p>
        <p>Stegner can be a frustratingly gifted writer, as likely to express an elegant idea as an overly ornate one: Dru ''was thinking about the big easy splendor of meeting and falling in love, and then about the small quiet hidden things that revealed themselves with time.'' In addition, she has a gift for delivering nicely timed surprises toward the end of a story. This is especially true of the first novella, whose ugly conclusion contains the most beautiful writing in the book.</p>
        <p>As with the word ''triptych,'' there's sometimes a highfalutin feel to the writing in ''Pipers at the Gates of Dawn.'' But it's countered by Stegner's keen understanding of her setting -- a place that is nothing if not down to earth.</p>
