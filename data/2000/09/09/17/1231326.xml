        <p>THE group of stocks that is leading the market higher is growing, and Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, sees new opportunities for investors as a result.</p>
        <p>The market's broadening has accelerated as investors have become convinced that the Federal Reserve has slowed the rapid pace of economic growth and will not raise interest rates anytime soon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Acuff took time last week from his vacation in Helmsley, England, to discuss the new possibilities. Following are excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>Q. What kind of opportunities does the broadening market create for investors?</p>
        <p>A. The opportunity is that you probably have to focus more on constructing a portfolio through diversification. You know that for the last couple of years, concentration really was the winning strategy: the Janus 20 list, for example -- that type of thing was really the winning way to approach the market. You didn't want to own a lot of stocks. You wanted to own a few stocks in high tech.</p>
        <p>Now, to deal with the broadening of the market, you really need to diversify, you need to have a longer list of stocks covering more of a variety of areas in the market. So the opportunity for the investor is that it's opened up more alternatives, more possibilities, shall we say, for investors to make money rather then focusing on just one area, which for many is technology. Believe me I'm not trying to put down technology. I'm just saying its no longer just technology; it's no longer an elitist or single-focus market.</p>
        <p>Q. But doesn't a less focused market make it more difficult for investors in terms of picking stocks?</p>
        <p>A. Well, it is more challenging, certainly. But depending upon their goals, objectives, risk tolerance and so forth, a broader set of stocks tends to balance the risk characteristics. You have to put this in the context of a high market -- a bull market that has been in place for years and years and years. At some point in time, investors need to take a bit less risk.</p>
        <p>I am not telling people to go out and sell their high-priced stocks. And I am not going to tell people to go out and buy steel stocks that are cheap. I am saying, ''Look, there are growth opportunities in the market.'' They may not be as spectacular as some others have been. But look at where the market is and how long this thing has been running. Maybe in that context one should be a bit more diversified, or at least accept that there are more alternatives from which one can choose to build a portfolio.</p>
        <p>Q. Could you focus on what you mean by growth stocks?</p>
        <p>A. I tend to like growth -- earnings growth -- over time. Ideally, I like to buy growth at a reasonable value. And in terms of earnings growth, I tend to favor companies that have the potential to grow their earnings 15 percent annually or more over a five-year period. I will accept something a bit less than that. But again, I want that growth to be reasonably valued.</p>
        <p>One of the ways that I can value that growth and put different types of growth situations on a more even keel, shall we say, is by using GARP -- growth at a reasonable price. I first look at the price-earnings ratio for a stock, using earnings estimates for 2001. Then I compare that price-earnings ratio to the projected growth rate for that company's earnings over the next five years. For example, if I am projecting a growth rate of 20 percent in earnings for the next five years and the P/E ratio is 20, then the P/E-to-growth ratio, or peg ratio, is 1.</p>
        <p>I think that peg ratio is a very reasonable valuation for a company, where you have reasonable expectations of growth on a sustained basis. Now when I get up above two times the peg, then it becomes what I call a GAAP -- growth at any price.</p>
        <p>So really what I am doing in this market, and have been since March, is focusing on growth, and encouraging investors to put new money into GARP-type situations, as opposed to putting money into GAAP situations.</p>
        <p>I can always have my disappointments in my GARP's. The market is the market, and you can have disappointments in almost anything. But with my GARP's, at least, I am controlling my risk tolerance.</p>
        <p>Q. Can you list some examples of GAAP's?</p>
        <p>A. EMC is a GAAP, JDS Uniphase is a GAAP, Yahoo is a GAAP, just for several examples. I am not trying to take anything away from them. I am just saying, ''Hey, these are high-priced stocks.''</p>
        <p>Q. What are some stocks that you put in the GARP group?</p>
        <p>A. In the GARP group I would put America Online. I would put I.B.M., Kimberly-Clark, Safeway, United Technologies and Flextronics. And I would point out that GARP has outperformed GAAP consistently this year. GARP stocks, as a group, are up 4.0 percent this year, and GAAP's are up 0.2 percent.</p>
