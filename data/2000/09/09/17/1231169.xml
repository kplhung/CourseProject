        <p>Soon the Seyval blanc grapes at Clinton Vineyards, in a pastoral niche of Dutchess County, will be picked, destemmed, crushed and fermented in Ben and Phyllis Feder's green barn.</p>
        <p>Over a period of 23 vintages, Mr. Feder, an early Hudson Valley winemaker, has so mastered this fairly complex, underappreciated French-American hybrid grape that connoisseurs could confuse his wine with an especially lean Macon chardonnay. In New York's wine history, Seyval succeeded simple indigenous grapes like Niagara before chardonnay upstaged everything.</p>
        <p>The approaching harvest provides a timely reason for Westchester residents to take a weekend spin to the Feders' homey estate in tiny Clinton Corners, off the Taconic State Parkway.</p>
        <p>After harvest time, as the sun fades to brass, the days turn as crisp as the Feders' pale Seyval bubbling and frothing toward a destiny as a bracing aperitif, or raw bar and fish-dinner accompaniment.</p>
        <p>Sipped lightly cool, the bright, zesty, young '99 Seyval ($12.50 at the winery) displays delicate tropical fruit, peach and pear aromas and flavors and a nearly mineral-like Chablis-type raciness. The texture is smooth, the finish persistent.</p>
        <p>The still available '98 Seyval ($15 at the winery) when tasted in September '99 was supple and almost sweet, with honeysuckle in the bouquet, a delicately fruity flavor, mouth-watering acidity and a viscous, creamy texture.</p>
        <p>If you're caught by the Seyvals' refreshing dryness, try the nonvintage Seyval naturel sparkling wine ($18.50).</p>
        <p>Diversifying recently, the Feders also offer a $20 (half-bottle) portlike dessert wine called Romance, and two dessert wines in half-bottle, which, though exceeding our $20 limit, invite noshing: Embrace, made from raspberries, and Desire, from blueberries, each $23.50.</p>
        <p>Clinton Vineyards, Schultzville Road, Clinton Corners, gives tours and tastings on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and by appointment; (914) 266-5372; fax, (914) 266-3395.</p>
        <p>Its '98 and '99 Seyvals each cost $12 at Green Lane, 741 Bedford Road, Bedford Hills; the '99 is $13 at Art of Wine, 1 Cooley Street, Pleasantville; the '98 and '99 are each $13 at Suburban Wine, 379 Downing Drive, Yorktown Heights.</p>
