        <p>Name: Howard Wolfson  Age: 33  Coming from: Washington  Looking for: A victory</p>
        <p>When Howard Wolfson, Hillary Clinton's communications director, moved to New York last summer, he couldn't face the local hazing ritual known as the Manhattan apartment hunt. Clinton's listening tour had just begun, and Wolfson was the sole person juggling scores of calls a day, piling up stacks of messages from international media outlets he had never even heard of. Taking a few hours off to scout an overrated Upper West Side brownstone didn't seem like the most efficient use of his time. So when Wolfson wasn't on the road with Clinton, he did what new arrivals to New York have always done: he crashed on friends' couches. He lived out of a beat-up garment bag that contained a laptop, a dour-looking stuffed animal called Telly Monster (''He's one of Elmo's friends'') and a few changes of clothes. The frequent reappearances in his wardrobe did not go unnoticed. When one of the first lady's Secret Service agents gave Wolfson identification pins, he told him, ''I'm giving you two -- one for each of your suits.''</p>
        <p>It took Wolfson fully five months to find a home, but he was happy merely to have arrived in Manhattan. Though he lived in Washington for most of the last decade (working for Representative Nita Lowey, the Westchester Democrat, and then commuting from D. C. to work on Charles Schumer's senatorial race against Al D'Amato), he never intended to stay that long. ''Every six months,'' Wolfson says, ''I'd promise myself that in the next six months I'd move to New York.'' Now that he has, the city he found is at once more and less vivid than the one in which most new New Yorkers live. He joined a small circle of very powerful political players, taking regular conference calls with Harold Ickes and Mandy Grunwald (and, on the rare occasion, the president). He has marched in almost every major New York City parade, digests every local paper from The Forward to El Diario and routinely makes decisions that shape the most scrutinized race in Senate history. But as a result, Wolfson barely knows his own neighborhood. ''It's like I'm seeing the city through a pane of glass,'' he says mournfully, sitting cross-legged on the floor of his apartment.</p>
        <p>Although Wolfson moved in last November, his high-ceilinged living room has exactly one piece of furniture in it -- a serviceable brown couch. The bedroom contains nothing but a futon with a heap of blankets. A small television sits humbly on the cardboard box it came in. It wouldn't be accurate to say it looks as if he just moved in; it's so empty, it looks more as if he's already moved out, having decided he might as well leave a few things behind. Surveying his empty home as he polishes off some takeout fried rice, he shrugs. ''The decor is sort of in keeping with the lifestyle,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Wolfson is bearded and rumpled, a few years shy of ''avuncular.'' His reputation is for extremely long hours, aggressive campaigning and a reliable pessimism that plays well with the local media. ''If you were a camp counselor,'' says Joel Siegel of The Daily News, ''he'd be that kid you just wanted to put your arm around and ask, 'What's wrong?'''</p>
        <p>The campaign, of course, quickly gave Wolfson ample opportunity to worry. By the time he was able to hire more staff members, he had already deflected mocking dismissals of the listening tour and done damage control on the F.A.L.N. controversy (in which President Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists was criticized as a sop to his wife's potential Latino supporters in New York). In three months, Wolfson made more television appearances than he had in his previous 10 years of political life. Before appearances, he used to spend a half-hour bouncing lines off his colleagues; now he has reduced his prep time to ''the 10-minute walk it takes me to get from my office to New York 1.''</p>
        <p>Last winter, Wolfson's name even briefly became part of the pop-culture lexicon. ''Friends started calling me,'' Wolfson says, ''and asking, 'Are you aware that David Letterman keeps calling you a pantywaist on his show?''' Letterman, who was agitating for Clinton to appear on his program, eventually went so far as to put the request to Wolfson on air, calling him in his office during a taping of ''Late Show.'' Wolfson responded by asking if the Carnegie Deli would deliver to the greenroom. Letterman, expecting a straight man, got cranky. ''This guy is not . . . connected,'' he peevishly told the audience. ''We're talking to Daffy Duck or somebody. . . . What's his name? Buddy Bobson?'' Says Wolfson mildly, ''Dave didn't appreciate my attempts at humor.''</p>
        <p>Because of his frequent television appearances, Wolfson started getting recognized in public. One of the first times was by a middle-age woman who approached him near his office on West 34th Street and asked if he was indeed Howard Wolfson. ''I told her I was,'' Wolfson recalls, ''thinking, Hey, this is pretty cool, a complete stranger knows who I am. Then she got a few inches closer to my face and said, really loudly, 'Well, I hate your boss, and I'll never vote for her!'''</p>
        <p>Public beratings aside, Wolfson and his team found a groove in the months leading up to Rudolph W. Giuliani's withdrawal, capitalizing cannily on Giuliani's apparent ambivalence. When he canceled an event in the Rochester area to attend a Yankee game instead, the first lady rearranged her plans in order to show up there that very day. ''I heard some people around here were hoping to meet a Senate candidate,'' Wolfson told the crowd. His team, known for ''putting out a lot of paper'' -- about a news release a day -- finally gained a few points, for really the first time all year, in the aftermath of the Dorismond shooting in March. Then Giuliani withdrew, and Rick Lazio stepped in. Wolfson was forced to confront a new and practically unknown contender. ''The campaign was always intense,'' says Wolfson, ''but this was intense in a different way.''</p>
        <p>In recent months, the team has been trying to focus public scrutiny on Lazio. Wolfson himself, along with a Democratic State Committee member dressed as Uncle Sam, showed up at a Lazio event in Harlem in August, taunting Lazio with the first lady's New York property tax returns and challenging him to release his returns. In any other campaign, it might have been the candidate who seized such a photo op; but with his boss invested in preserving her dignity, it occasionally falls to Wolfson to supply those moments of semi-slapstick.</p>
        <p>As Wolfson's public profile was steadily rising, his personal life was pretty much flat-lining until his girlfriend of three years, Terri McCullough, moved from Washington to join him last winter. ''New York was always the last place I thought I'd want to be,'' says McCullough, a redheaded, native Californian who is now communications director for Pencil, a nonprofit educational organization. But now she's the one enjoying the city, while Wolfson experiences it vicariously through her. He pores over the offerings in Time Out, ticking off ''things I'd like to do but can't,'' while McCullough goes to plays and concerts. The only time she managed to get Wolfson to the theater, to see ''True West,'' he fell asleep mid-production. ''It was no comment at all on the performances,'' McCullough says dryly.</p>
        <p>During her campaign widowhood, McCullough has also been using her spare time to train for the New York Marathon. Wolfson swears that is the one social event he absolutely won't miss, even though it falls on Nov. 5, two days before his own test of endurance comes to an end. ''I can see the end in sight,'' he says. ''With binoculars.'' As if to convince himself that that vision is not a mirage, he and McCullough even squeezed in a few hours over a recent weekend to go shopping. The furniture is on its way.</p>
