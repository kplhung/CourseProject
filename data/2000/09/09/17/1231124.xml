        <p>THE Waterzooi Belgian Bistro in Garden City was an almost instant hit with diners, and now its lower-priced next-door neighbor, the Victory Oyster Bar and Smoke House, which has the same owners, is headed for the winner's circle as well. This cavernous, vaguely retro spot at 860 Franklin Avenue (516-739-7660) has two unlikely culinary partners: icy cold fresh oysters, clams, crab, shrimp and lobsters, staples of traditional New York and New England raw bars, are paired with the smoky, spicy barbecue dishes of the South and Southwest.</p>
        <p>Add what is probably the Island's longest list of bourbons and an almost equally impressive array of tequilas and beers -- plus a very respectable wine list -- and you have all the makings for an evening of good eating and drinking.</p>

        <p>THE Waterzooi Belgian Bistro in Garden City was an almost instant hit with diners, and now its lower-priced next-door neighbor, the Victory Oyster Bar and Smoke House, which has the same owners, is headed for the winner's circle as well. This cavernous, vaguely retro spot at 860 Franklin Avenue (516-739-7660) has two unlikely culinary partners: icy cold fresh oysters, clams, crab, shrimp and lobsters, staples of traditional New York and New England raw bars, are paired with the smoky, spicy barbecue dishes of the South and Southwest.</p>
        <p>Add what is probably the Island's longest list of bourbons and an almost equally impressive array of tequilas and beers -- plus a very respectable wine list -- and you have all the makings for an evening of good eating and drinking.</p>
        <p>Diners at this mix-and-match restaurant seem equally attracted to both sides of the menu, filling tiny chrome buckets with empty shells as they splash homemade spicy barbecue sauce on piles of brisket, ribs, chicken, steak and sausages. Oysters can be ordered individually ($1.20 to $2) from the daily chalkboard selections, as part of the raw-bar sampler or the even more spectacular Victory Tier sampler. The raw-bar choices include an oyster shooter -- a shot of pepper-flavored vodka with a bluepoint oyster at the bottom -- for $6 and a half pound of peel-and-eat shrimp for $9.50, along with clams on the half shell, crab claws and jumbo shrimp cocktails.</p>
        <p>That Victory Tier is quite a tour de  force. It costs $99, feeds four and contains two levels (the top cooked, the bottom raw) with eight each of oysters, clams, jumbo shrimp, crab claws and New Zealand mussels, six Louisiana crawfish, a whole lobster and a clump of calamari salad. Order a bottle ($21) or a few glasses of white wine ($6.50 each) and you have a lovely, light, low-fat meal or a very substantial snack. The Victory Tier  comes with cocktail, horseradish and red-wine vinegar dipping sauces, lemons galore, unlimited packets of oyster crackers and a border of long-stemmed caper berries.</p>
        <p>Those large green-shelled New Zealand mussels, cooked in white wine, and the calamari salad with diced corn, celery and pimentos, are fresh and gritless. The shrimp are firm, huge and meaty, the oysters and littleneck and cherrystone clams are pristine. So is the tender little lobster. The crab claws are unremarkable, and the crawfish, with their bitter aftertaste, are more trouble to eat than they are worth.</p>
        <p>The hearty charcoal-grilled, smoked, barbecued, marinated and fire-roasted choices on the smokehouse side of the menu are considerably more filling and easier to eat.</p>
        <p>Side dishes can be ordered separately and can substitute for the somewhat more expensive starters.  They include a generous portion of thick, hand-cut country bacon slabs with a few caramelized apple sections and a tangy three pepper jam dip ($6) and a spiral tower of airy, 28-spice onion rings with a refreshing horseradish dip ($6).</p>
        <p>Among the recommended side  dishes are rich, rustic, Texas-style baked beans ($5) and memorable baked creamed spinach topped with a squiggle of pungent Maytag blue cheese ($6). Two of the most expensive appetizers are also worth noting: five cornmeal-crusted delicate catfish fingers, served with a muted jalapeno margarita marmalade, and even better, crisp deep-fried bluepoint oysters on the half shell with cucumber ceviche and resting on kernels of tarragon-spiced creamed corn (both $11).</p>
        <p>The sandwiches, which come with cooling cole slaw and terrific spicy shoestring potatoes, are meal-sized.  That's especially true for the two nine-ounce charcoal-grilled sirloin burgers ($9 and $12), and the colossal lobster roll, a hot dog bun loaded with sweet Maine lobster ($21).</p>
        <p>Tasty, moist corn bread, slaw, grilled-pineapple salsa and spicy prickly pears accompany what the menu calls ''new world barbecue'' selections. The juicy hickory-smoked brisket ($16) tasted wonderfully old world. So did the grilled pork sausages ($15), hot as a blowtorch, and the sticky, slightly sweet barbecued baby back ribs ($22), slow smoked and fall-away tender. A combination of all three, plus a skewer of jumbo shrimp, can be ordered for $23 and will feed two.</p>
        <p>At least a couple of other main courses off the barbecue trail are worth considering. The hardwood-smoked flat-fish sampler ($17) -- hand-sliced salmon, sturgeon and sable accompanied by Guinness black bread slices and horseradish sour cream -- is a mild, light oasis on a menu packed with hefty barbecue and steak selections. The thin, tender and tasty marinated skirt steak ($21), pink at its center and resting on a mound of buttermilk mashed potatoes and broccoli rape with toasted garlic, is not to be missed.</p>
        <p>Finally, a few caveats. Reservations are taken only for parties of six or more, just one major credit card  (American Express) is accepted, and the menu for the specialty coffees and after-dinner drinks inexplicably omits all prices. They are $4.50 for all coffees, and $4.50 to $12 for the drinks.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>Red, a bright, modern 65-seat American bistro at 417 New York Avenue in Huntington Village (no phone yet) is scheduled to open in a few days. It replaces Viva La Vida.  Owned by Robert Ornato and Michael Christy who operate Jonathan's Ristorante in Huntington, the modestly priced spot (entrees $14 to $21 and wine at less than $20 a bottle) has an  antique, zinc-topped bar surrounded by 1,600 bottles of red wine. Hence the name. Mr. Christy will be the executive chef.</p>

        <p>Correction:  October 1, 2000, Sunday  A report in the A la Carte column on Sept. 17 about Red, a new restaurant in Huntington, misstated its ownership. Robert Ornato owns the restaurant with Nino Antuzzi, not with Michael Christy, who is the executive chef. The report also misstated the price range of Red's wines. They are $20 to $200 a bottle, not under $20.</p>
