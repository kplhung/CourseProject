        <p>There are those who celebrate the ''melting pot'' -- a mythic caldron constantly bubbling far-flung flavors until they become bland and commonplace -- and there are those who worry the caldron. The authentic, say the latter, is, by definition, ''unmeltable,'' and can exist only apart from mainstream taste.</p>
        <p>Neither camp disputes the inevitability that time and the mass market will eventually erode distinctions. But along the way, the collision between the familiar and the foreign offers experiences of flavor, hope and revelation that, like so many bubbles in the pot, are the essence of a living, changing cuisine.</p>
        <p>In large ports of entry like New York, where, at last count, more than 100,000 legal aliens from well over 100 countries settle and cook each year, you can smell the future on the streets in the vying aromas of ethnic cuisines wafting from carts and holes in the wall. And, increasingly, you can catch the vibrant sputter as the arriviste and the established meet in some of the country's finest restaurants.</p>
        <p>Legions of newly arrived immigrants working as dishwashers and runners start to inform menus. At the Lobster Club in New York, for instance, the chef, Anne Rosenzweig, was swayed by the staff meals prepared by the restaurant's Bangladeshi busboys. ''The spicing was so elegant and delicious,'' she recalls, ''that I found myself drawing from it, inventing things like the corn fritters we serve.''</p>
        <p>Inspiration, rather than literal duplication, is usually the result. Eleven Madison Park, where Nick Oltarsh is the executive sous-chef, offers a lamb dish Oltarsh created when he was over at Gramercy Tavern and observed the Dominican prep cooks.</p>
        <p>Michelle Bernstein, the chef at the Strand in Miami Beach, was so intrigued by the techniques and flavors used by her Peruvian prep cook, Miguel Puelles, that she visited his homeland. Her Jamaican sous-chef, Sara Mair, also influences her menus.</p>
        <p>Contrasts between the unknown and the established are part of what makes food worth eating. David Waltuck, Chanterelle's chef, describes such ''boundary-crossing moments'' in his book ''Staff Meals From Chanterelle,'' written with Melicia Phillips, which will be published next month by Workman.</p>
        <p>Boundary crossing is never safe and always fleeting. The shock of an unfamiliar flavor happens in moments -- before the new colors on the culinary palate grow matte and tacky, before the inexorable melting begins.</p>
        <p>Miguel's Ceviche  (Adapted from Michelle Bernstein, The Strand, Miami Beach)  8 jumbo shrimp, shelled, deveined and cut into  1/2-inch chunks  6 ounces grouper fillet, cut into  1/2-inch chunks  1 tablespoon peeled, minced ginger  1 teaspoon peeled, minced garlic  1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste  2 lemons  2 limes  2 ears corn, shucked  12 mussels, scrubbed  12 clams, shucked, juice reserved  12 oysters, shucked, juice reserved  Leaves from 1 bunch cilantro, chopped  3 tablespoons minced red onion  1tablespoon minced celery.</p>
        <p>1. In a small, nonreactive bowl, combine the shrimp, grouper, ginger, garlic and 1 teaspoon of salt. Add the juice of 1 lemon and the juice of 1 lime. Toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add corn and boil for 5 minutes. Cool in a bowl of cold water. Remove, pat dry and use a large knife to cut the kernels from the cob. Discard the cobs and refrigerate the kernels.</p>
        <p>3. Place a cup of water in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the mussels, cover the pan and steam until the mussels just open, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain immediately and set aside. When cool enough to handle, remove the mussel meat and refrigerate, discarding the shells and any unopened mussels.</p>
        <p>4. Drain excess liquid from the shrimp and grouper and transfer to a large bowl. Add the corn, mussels, clams and oysters with their juice, cilantro, onion and celery. Add juice of the remaining lime and lemon and toss. Season with salt to taste. Divide the mixture among 4 small plates or martini glasses and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 appetizers.</p>
        <p>Spicy Corn Fritters  (Adapted from ANNE ROSENZWEIG, the Lobster Club, New York City)</p>
        <p>3/4 cup flour  2 tablespoons yellow cornmeal</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</p>
        <p>1/8 teaspoon baking soda</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</p>
        <p>1/2 cup milk  2 tablespoons buttermilk  1 cup fresh or well-drained defrosted corn kernels  Canola oil for deep frying.</p>
        <p>1. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, turmeric, cumin seeds, garam masala, cayenne, pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. Whisk until thoroughly combined. Pour in the milk and buttermilk and stir until just mixed. Stir in the corn.</p>
        <p>2. In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, add oil to a depth of 1 1/2 inches. When the oil is very hot, working in batches, drop in rounded tablespoons of the batter and fry, turning the fritters occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle with salt and serve hot with corn chowder or clam chowder or on their own as an appetizer.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Sara's Sweetbread Fricassee  (adapted from Michelle Bernstein, The Strand, Miami Beach)  1 pound calves' sweetbreads  1 tablespoon unsalted butter  1 tablespoon canola oil  Kosher salt to taste  1/3 cup flour  2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped  1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped  1 bunch scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced  3 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced  4 1/4 cups chicken stock  3 tablespoons tomato paste  1 tablespoon Pickapeppa or Worcestershire sauce</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg  1 bunch fresh thyme  1 whole green Scotch bonnet chili  3 whole allspice berries  1 clove  1 bay leaf  Freshly ground black pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil and add sweetbreads. Simmer for 10 minutes. Drain, cool sweetbreads in a bowl of cold water, remove and peel away any membrane. Cut into 1-inch-thick slices.</p>
        <p>2. Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Salt the sweetbread pieces and dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Add to skillet when the butter has melted. Cook, turning once, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Add the carrots, onion, scallions and garlic, shaking the skillet occasionally, until the vegetables are just tender, 3 to 4 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Add the stock, tomato paste, Pickapeppa sauce and nutmeg to the skillet. Tie the thyme, whole chili, allspice berries, clove and bay leaf in a square of cheesecloth and add to the skillet. Bring to a boil, lower to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the liquid is thickened and reduced by about  1/2, 30 to 35 minutes.</p>
        <p>4. Remove skillet from the heat. Discard cheesecloth bundle. Season with salt and pepper and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Dominican Braised Lamb  (Adapted from Nick Oltarsh, Eleven Madison Park, New York)  For the lamb:  2 tablespoons canola oil  4 lamb shanks, trimmed of excess fat  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  10 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed  6 cups chicken stock  2 teaspoons capers with liquid  2 sprigs fresh thyme  2 sprigs fresh tarragon or  3/4teaspoon dried tarragon</p>
        <p>1/4 Scotch bonnet chili</p>
        <p>For the sauce:  2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1/2 onion, chopped  1 stalk celery, chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 green bell pepper, chopped  1 1/2 shallots, peeled and minced  3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced  228-ounce cans plum tomatoes, drained  1 tablespoon tomato paste  2 tablespoons sugar  2 teaspoons capers, with liquid  1 small sliver Scotch bonnet chili  Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. To make the lamb, in the bottom of a large Dutch oven or braising pan, heat the oil over high heat. Sprinkle lamb shanks with salt and pepper and cook until seared all over. Remove shanks, drain excess oil and return shanks to the pan. Add garlic, chicken stock, capers and enough cold water to just cover the shanks. In a square of cheesecloth, tie together the thyme, tarragon and Scotch bonnet and add to the pan.</p>
        <p>2. Return the pan to high heat and bring just to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover the pan and bake in the oven until the meat is very tender and begins to pull away from the bone, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and cool. Discard the cheesecloth bundle.</p>
        <p>3. To make the sauce, in a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, bell pepper, shallots and garlic and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Using your hands, squeeze as much excess liquid from the drained tomatoes as possible. Add the tomatoes to the pan along with the tomato paste, sugar and 1 teaspoon of the capers. Add 2 1/2 cups of the liquid the lamb shanks were cooked in. Tie the sliver of Scotch bonnet in a piece of cheesecloth and add. Bring to a boil, adjust the heat and simmer, uncovered, for  1/2hour.</p>
        <p>4. Remove and discard the cheesecloth bundle. Working in batches, carefully puree the mixture in a blender. Return the sauce to the pan. If it is very thick, whisk in more of the lamb cooking liquid. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>5. When ready to serve, reheat the lamb shanks in their liquid on top of the stove. Stir the remaining teaspoon of capers into the sauce and reheat if necessary. Place a lamb shank on each of 4 deep plates. Cover with sauce and sprinkle with cilantro. Serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
