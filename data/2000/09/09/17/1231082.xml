        <p>With legal prostitution in the famed Red Light District and marijuana sold openly in the so-called coffee-shops, Amsterdam lives up to its reputation as a freewheeling pleasure capital. Amsterdam is one of Europe's premier club towns, and the Dutch are very serious about house music. Late-night action is centered in the Rembrandtplein and Leidseplein districts, both within walking distance of the city center. With Amsterdam's popular informal ''after parties,'' Saturday night can last well into Sunday morning.</p>
        <p>Melkweg means Milky Way, an appropriate name for a former dairy factory that now exists as a nonprofit arts venue. Saturday night draws huge dance crowds for dueling D.J.'s, who rule the two ground-floor loft spaces. ''Pop Arena,'' featuring nostalgic tunes from the 80's and 90's, opens at midnight, while Dance Arena, spotlighting jungle/house/trance trends, starts after 1.</p>
        <p>The door policy and dress code are so relaxed as to be nearly nonexistent. Basic black stretch jeans are the favored uniform, but a carefully coiffed Louise Brooks look-alike may be dancing next to people in football shirts and baseball caps. The mostly local 20-to-35-year-old crowd, usually drinks draft beer.</p>
        <p>Besides the dance floors, there is a snack bar and a tranquil tea room, where new acquaintances exchange phone numbers. Weeknight themes vary from Jamaican Crossover to alternate Amsterdam punk, although headline acts, like the Wailers, require advance ticketing.</p>
        <p>Manet, Degas and Picasso had no trouble finding absinthe drinkers, but contemporary artists aren't so fortunate. The wormwood-flavored alcohol, suspected of inducing hallucinations and madness, was banned in the United States and France by World War I. Visitors can sample turn-of-the-century decadence at the Absinthe Night Bar, one of Old Center's many intimate night spots just south of the Dam.</p>
        <p>Lacquered ivory walls, encrusted with mirrors and gilded mosaic tiles, provide a glittery backdrop for a sophisticated clientele. While the D.J. spins a soothing mix of soft groove and lounge sound, the wary quench their thirst with mineral water or a simple glass of white wine. But the bartender can also pour a measure of the legendary ''green fairy'' for about $3, albeit a slightly less potent version of what Verlaine drank.</p>
        <p>The drinks are less exotic at the jovial Bourbon Street Jazz and Blues Club, which attracts a casual, jean-clad crowd of all ages for nightly concerts. Weeknights often feature cover bands with a pop flavor, but on Friday and Saturday, when the doors open from 10 P.M. to 5 A.M., S.R.O. crowds sway and rub shoulders to blues rhythms. Three glass chandeliers hanging over the bar provide an incongruous dash of glamour to an otherwise low-key and comfortably scruffy decor.</p>
        <p>Melkweg, 234A Lijnbaansgracht, (31-20) 531-8181. Open daily, but will occasionally close a night or two in a slow week. Admission for Saturday dancing is $6.25, for special acts up to $20.</p>
        <p>Absinthe Night Bar, 171 Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal; (31-20) 777-4870. Free entry.</p>
        <p>Bourbon Street Jazz and Blues Club, 6-8 Leidsekruisstraat; (31-20) 623-3440. Admission, $2.10.</p>
