        <p>ALL was quiet back in April, when the East Hampton Town Board made two applications for Suffolk County ''greenways'' funds. One application called for preservation of scenic farmland; the other was to develop a sports park with playing fields.</p>
        <p>Problem was, the proposals were for the same piece of property.</p>
        <p>The competing plans reflect deep divisions within the community, where passionate advocates of rural preservation are clashing with those seeking to alleviate an undisputed shortage of ballfields. And when a map drawn up by a sports-field proponent was published in the local newspaper last month, the response was swift and vocal.</p>
        <p>More than 500 residents, from coaches in their sneakers to part-time residents who rode the Hampton Jitney to attend, came to a Town Board hearing in August to voice their opinions. The town supervisor, Jay Schneiderman, said the meeting was intended to gather the community's thoughts on the possibility of turning the property, which sits on 42 acres along Long Lane, into a sports park, with as many as 15 playing fields. The parcel, known as the Schwenk farm, is across the street from the East Hampton High School, which has run out of space for its growing roster of athletic teams.</p>
        <p>Advocates of the sports park plan stressed that the town's current public ballfields are overused and inadequate to accommodate East Hampton's various baseball, softball, soccer, football, rugby and other teams. One resident likened local athletes to nomads, saying that teams go wherever they can find space to play.</p>
        <p>''There are many evenings where there is not a square foot to bring a Little League team,'' said another, Tim Brenneman, noting that there were some 600 children involved in youth baseball teams throughout the town this year.</p>
        <p>''What this town has failed to do is provide recreational facilities to keep our children occupied,'' Laurie Wiltshire, vice president of the Old Montauk Athletic Club, told the Town Board. ''We're going to have a problem with crime and we are going to have a problem with drugs, and that's going to affect everyone's property values.''</p>
        <p>Proponents say the Long Lane parcel is an ideal location because of its size and proximity to the school. Joe Bloecker, speaking on behalf of the Montauk Little League, called the property ''the perfect location. They need the space, and the space sits 50 feet from the curb of the school.''</p>
        <p>The town's men's and women's summertime softball leagues had 17 teams this year, said Richard Snyder, and just two fields with lighting for nighttime play. More fields are needed, he said, including with lights. But Supervisor Schneiderman stressed that the town was not considering anything more than grass fields with white stripes and perhaps a small restroom, and that light towers would not be built.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the Long Lane proposal have made no effort to dispute the demand for more sports fields. Rather, they have said that the Schwenk parcel is inappropriate, calling instead for its preservation as farmland. Some have urged the town to build playing fields in each of the town's hamlets, saying a decentralized solution would be more accessible to families and to youth not of driving age.</p>
        <p>''Our position is that it's not Long Lane or no land,'' said Andrew Goldstein on behalf of the Circle Association, a group of property owners in the Village of East Hampton, which nearly borders the Schwenk parcel. He urged the town to ''vigorously'' explore other places where recreational needs could be met.</p>
        <p>Russell Stein, a board member of Save our Farmlands, a local civic group, argued that the Schwenk farm ''is not an appropriate piece of land'' and reminded the board that the town has been committed to farmland preservation for several decades. ''This,'' he said of the current debate, ''is when we find out whether or not those ideas have sustenance and will sustain over time.''</p>
        <p>Opponents are concerned that the playing fields will ruin the vista from Long Lane and detract from the town's jealously guarded aesthetic appeal.</p>
        <p>''We are very aware of the needs of our community,'' said one resident, Frances O'Brien. ''We also have Long Lane, and I breathe a sigh of relief when I say Long Lane. Something very important is being taken away from this community if we lose that farmland.''</p>
        <p>Opponents also urged the town to wait for the results of its own study of the town's recreational needs before committing to the Schwenk Farm.</p>
        <p>''You've started that process,'' said Bob DeLuca, president of the Group for the South Fork, a preservation group. ''The problem is you have the cart before the horse with this proposal, and that has caused the consternation.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the town hired a Michigan company, Land Ethics, to embark on a townwide study of needs and possible locations for sports facilities. It has already given the town a long list of possible sites, including the Schwenk parcel, and is expected to complete its study by November.</p>
        <p>''We really have not studied our recreational needs, but we know we have a serious shortage,'' Mr. Schneiderman conceded. On the other hand, he added, ''I think people think of it as their farmland. There's a scenic vista shared by all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schneiderman said that any sports fields proposals for the Long Lane parcel have been put on hold until the study is completed. But the county, which would pick up the tab if the Schwenk farm is used for recreation and 70 percent of the cost if it is enrolled in the farmland preservation program, has already ordered an appraisal of the property. The move prompted George O. Guldi, the county legislator who represents East Hampton and is opposed to the Long Lane sports fields proposal, to submit a bill to block funding for the project. The county Legislature approved the measure on Sept. 1, and the bill is now on the desk of the county executive, Robert Gaffney.</p>
        <p>The town, said Supervisor Schneiderman, has also authorized an update of an earlier appraisal of the Schwenk parcel and has had a local preservation organization, the Peconic Land Trust, approach the owner, Henry Schwenk, about the possibility of buying it.</p>
        <p>The competing plans have tended to obscure the fact that it's Mr. Schwenk, whose family worked the farm for decades, who has the final say. While Mr. Schwenk declined requests for an interview, he has told the local paper, The East Hampton Star, that he intends to sell to the highest bidder.</p>
        <p>Recently Mr. Schwenk has leased the property to other local farmers. If he sells to private interests the property could continue to be farmed  or it could be developed to yield as many as 16 house lots. A plan for housing development is already before the town planning board.</p>
        <p>The latter possibility was something Mr. DeLuca was sure to warn the community about. ''While we tear ourselves apart over the things we all believe in,'' he said, ''the real bad guys come in.''</p>
