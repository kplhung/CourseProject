      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>As the spring 2001 fashion shows approached, eye-catching invitations once again went out. This season, however, designers are scaling back from the more elaborate attention grabbers of yore -- crates of grass, candy necklaces, CD-ROM short movies -- and going the old-fashioned paper route. Granted, paper that's more dressed up than just plain engraved cards. Saks Fifth Avenue is inviting guests to its Fashion Targets Breast Cancer event with a three-dimensional paper doll that stands upright, arms akimbo, with the information printed in swirls on her circle skirt. Also in the paper doll theme, the notice for Walter van Beirendonck's summer 2001 show features a Keith Haringesque cardboard punch-out figure with the words ''Starship Earth'' printed on it. Sara Kozlowski of Cake sent her invitations with a scented Chinese paper fan;  the show's where-and-when is printed inside the lid of its box. And Kenneth Cole, with his signature advocacy, issued voter registration cards and pencils with his invitations, packaged in a clear plastic bag printed in large block letters: ''Be Seen. Be Heard.''</p>
