        <p>Properties OF LIGHT</p>
        <p>A Novel of Love, Betrayal</p>
        <p>and Quantum Physics.</p>
        <p>By Rebecca Goldstein.</p>
        <p>244 pp. Boston:</p>

        <p>IT'S one kind of trick to turn philosophy into fiction, as Rebecca Goldstein did so successfully in her highly praised first novel, ''The Mind-Body Problem''; it's another, perhaps even headier alchemy, to make fiction out of physics. The eccentric personalities and near surreal revelations of 20th-century physics have provoked the imaginations of diversely gifted writers ranging from Alan Lightman to Jeanette Winterson, while Michael Frayn's hit play ''Copenhagen,'' about the wartime Bohr-Heisenberg encounter, demonstrates the inherent drama in a conflict of ideas.</p>
        <p>In her new novel, ''Properties of Light,'' Goldstein explores the darker side of such encounters and the danger in pursuing the flame of scientific truth. (The image of light-seeking moths compelled to their own ashen deaths recurs throughout.) Two physicists, Samuel Mallach and his young colleague Justin Childs, share a noble ambition to reconcile the contradictory claims of quantum mechanics and relativity, but in Goldstein's Gothic tale their blighted collaboration eventually leads to hatred, betrayal and even death.</p>
        <p>Like some of Goldstein's earlier fiction, ''Properties of Light'' is a campus novel. The story takes place both at a grand university that bears a strong resemblance to Princeton (where Justin meets Mallach and falls in love with his beautiful, highly intelligent daughter, Dana) and at Olympia, a small college town in upstate New York (where Justin was raised and Dana later teaches). Goldstein views campus life with a sharp eye, documenting the jealousies within academic departments, the solitariness of a devoted physics scholar, ''too alone to have any idea of how lonely he is,'' and the hovering cloud of threat or promise that Stockholm may call to confer its Nobel blessing on a member of the faculty.</p>
        <p>Yet readers expecting a comedy of academic manners may be surprised by Goldstein's stark tone. The story is alternately told in the third person and in Justin's voice -- a voice that is both bitter and poetic. ''The essential fact is that I hate her,'' is the novel's opening line, so that Justin's passion is narratively over before it has begun. Goldstein teases us with hints of violent death and unspecified treachery, darting back and forth between the first tragedy that shaped Justin's sensibility -- his beloved parents' death in a car crash when he was an undergraduate -- and scenes of the emotional triangle that later takes shape between Justin, Dana and her troubled father.</p>
        <p>Goldstein's chronological contortions artfully mirror the relativistic ideas of time that she so lucidly explains, while the quantum notion of nonlocality (''whereby particles, having once been subjected to quantum entanglement, will forever after continue to assert, even when widely separated, instantaneous influences over one another'') finds expression in the novel's obscured plot elements.</p>
        <p>What is the relation between the death of Dana's mother, Carlotta, who killed herself while driving drunk, and Samuel Mallach's earlier madness? What has made Justin a creature of such hatred -- and, for that matter, is he a live narrator or a ghost? How could a brilliant figure like Mallach, once tapped by Einstein as his natural successor, have become scorned and ignored, ''a burned-out star'' teaching ''Physics for Poets''? (In an afterword, Goldstein explains that Mallach was inspired by a real figure, David Bohm, whose innovations were ignored by the scientific community.) Goldstein keeps her readers in a state of stimulated uncertainty, letting us work to reconstruct her story's complications.</p>
        <p>The result is a novel of cool grace and dark lyricism, lit by the imaginative fire of physics and its improbable cosmologies and colored too by the poetry and mysticism Mallach and his daughter enjoy, much to rational Justin's distaste. In this compact fiction, Goldstein finds room for quotations from Blake and explorations of tantric sex, as well as for the nexus she has been drawn to before -- that between eros and knowledge. Goldstein is fascinated by the erotic content in the quest for knowledge, as well as by the drive to know the object of one's desire. Justin and Dana discover that in both love and physics ''the knower and the known are physically entangled with one another.''</p>
        <p>It's an elegant idea, intelligently executed, but for all its luminous, incendiary imagery, Goldstein's novel remains quite cold. The love between Justin and Dana is curiously unmoving, perhaps because Dana ''took him altogether so little to her heart.'' Each of the three main characters is broken by hatred and distrust. What they share is a great alertness to truth and its intoxicating beauties -- for which they all, one way or another, must be ready to give their lives.</p>
