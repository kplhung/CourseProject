        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was in Austin, Tex., at the same time as John Schulian and I, too, held Willis Alan Ramsey's album in high esteem [''One Album to His Name, but It's the Stuff of Legend,'' Aug. 27]. I went to a show (in 1975 or 1976) and about halfway through I requested a song. The next thing I knew I was removed from the club with the declaration that ''Mr. Ramsey does not take requests.'' So I went home and broke my copy of Mr. Ramsey's sole musical contribution.</p>
