        <p>On Sept. 7, I attended a Town of Oyster Bay meeting regarding the shopping mall proposed for the Cerro Wire site on Robbins Lane [''Battle Lines Harden Over Syosset Mall,'' Sept. 3]. Initially, I was among the 800 or more residents forced to remain outside Syosset High School for hours, despite the many empty seats in the auditorium. Later, when I gained entry, I was frustrated to learn that the town was allowing the Taubman Company, the developer, to complete its presentation first. By drawing out its presentation, Taubman was able to prevent opponents from being heard until 10 p.m.</p>

        <p>On Sept. 7, I attended a Town of Oyster Bay meeting regarding the shopping mall proposed for the Cerro Wire site on Robbins Lane [''Battle Lines Harden Over Syosset Mall,'' Sept. 3]. Initially, I was among the 800 or more residents forced to remain outside Syosset High School for hours, despite the many empty seats in the auditorium. Later, when I gained entry, I was frustrated to learn that the town was allowing the Taubman Company, the developer, to complete its presentation first. By drawing out its presentation, Taubman was able to prevent opponents from being heard until 10 p.m.</p>
        <p>What reason could there have been to allow nonresident union representatives to reserve seats while residents were forced to wait outside? What stake do nonresidents have in our community? Does our quality of life matter to an outsider?</p>
        <p>Taubman officials and union representatives say the project would satisfy a need for construction jobs. One need only drive through Oyster Bay to see that there is no shortage of work in construction. Opponents of the mall are not trying to put construction workers out of work. We are worried about r traffic in neighborhoods near the mall. All we are asking is that the Cerro Wire property be used for to appropriate types of development, e.g., an office complex, senior housing or similar use.</p>
