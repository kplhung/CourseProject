        <p>GOD'S PERFECT CHILD: Living and Dying in the Christian Science Church, by Caroline Fraser. (Owl/Holt, $16.) A former Christian Scientist traces the history of the religion founded by Mary Baker Eddy, which in its heyday drew many followers with its spiritual approach to healing. Fraser ''does a splendid job of explaining the reasons for Christian Science's rise and fall,'' Philip Zaleski wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>WELDING WITH CHILDREN, by Tim Gautreaux. (Picador USA, $12.) These Cajun-flavored stories are set in a place where rusted car engines dangle from trees and kids have names like Nu-Nu and Tammynette. ''The author proves himself an able cartographer as well as a nimble writer, mapping with affectionate but unflinching accuracy both the back roads of Louisiana . . . and the distance between parents and children,'' Liam Callanan said here last year.</p>
        <p>WHEN PRIDE STILL MATTERED: A Life of Vince Lombardi, by David Maraniss. (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $16.) According to this biography, the legendary Green Bay Packers coach was a complex figure who was both a world-class motivator and a small-minded bully. ''Maraniss has a superb eye for detail'' and he ''shows not only that winning isn't everything, it's not even what it's cracked up to be,'' Allen St. John wrote in these pages in 1999.</p>
        <p>THE DANGEROUS HUSBAND, by Jane Shapiro. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.) The heroine of this humorous novel is a 40-ish New York photographer who is driven to distraction by her pathological -- if well-meaning -- klutz of a husband. ''Shapiro's most subtle accomplishment . . . is her creation of a loony-beyond-belief marriage that nevertheless bears a resemblance to every marriage,'' Karen Karbo said here in 1999.</p>
        <p>THE HUNGRY YEARS: A Narrative History of the Great Depression in America, by T. H. Watkins. (Owl/Holt, $16.) This chronicle of the 1930's draws on the experiences of ordinary Americans in both urban and rural areas. ''Watkins's prose often has the intensity and warmth of a photo by Dorothea Lange or a novel by John Steinbeck,'' Michael Kazin wrote here last year. ''He refreshes old accounts about the misery and insurgencies of the decade.''</p>
        <p>THE LAST DAYS OF LOUISIANA RED, by Ishmael Reed. (Dalkey Archive, $11.95.) This 1974 novel, nominally a detective story featuring a hoodoo sleuth named Papa LaBas, is mainly a free-wheeling satirical attack on 1960's racial politics and culture, exemplified by a militant movement known as the Moochers. ''Reed has a shrewd eye, a mean ear, a nasty tongue,'' Robert Scholes said in the Book Review. The same publisher has reissued another of Reed's novels, Yellow Back Radio Broke-Down ($11.95), a loopy allegory about a black cowboy in a surreal Wild West that lampoons organized religion and white myths about American history. ''Reed's topsy-turvy vision says something meaningful -- certainly in a unique way,'' one critic said in 1969.</p>
        <p>WORDS FAIL ME: What Everyone Who Writes Should Know About Writing, by Patricia T. O'Conner. (Harvest/Harcourt, $12.) A former copy editor at the Book Review offers advice on how to draft, write, revise, unsnarl and rescue prose. ''The practical and tough-minded O'Conner uses her playful sense of humor to help us swallow with a laugh the rules that schoolmarms once forced down students' throats,'' Diane Cole wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>THE RIVER SOUND: Poems, by W. S. Merwin. (Knopf, $15.) Now in his 70's, the poet continues to explore the grieving that accompanies daily life, but his work here is infused with a desire to settle old debts and bequeath particular moments. ''He's performing what James Merrill knew was the most important task of all, taking care of the 'need to make some kind of house / Out of the life lived, out of the love spent,' ''Melanie Rehak said here last year.</p>
        <p>THE PARROT'S LAMENT: And Other True Tales of Animal Intrigue, Intelligence, and Ingenuity, by Eugene Linden. (Plume, $12.95.) These accounts of wildlife behavior, drawn from interviews with zookeepers, researchers and trainers, feature con artists, scoundrels, jesters and even an orangutan escape artist. ''Linden's respect and love for all creatures in the animal kingdom is infectious,'' Sara Ivry wrote here earlier this year.</p>
        <p>AARON COPLAND: The Life and Work of an Uncommon Man, by Howard Pollack. (University of Illinois, $24.95.) This open-minded, respectful biography portrays the great composer (1900-90) as an indefatigable promoter of American music whose national convictions were central to his art. The result is ''the definitive study of Aaron Copland's life and work,'' John Rockwell said here last year.</p>
