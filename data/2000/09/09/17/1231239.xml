        <p>Over the years, Pfizer, the drug maker, has established a factory in Brooklyn, headquarters in Manhattan and laboratories in Connecticut. Now it has opened the Pfizer Learning Center at the Arrowwood Conference Center in Rye Brook.</p>
        <p>The center will primarily train sales representatives but will also train employees at all levels. Pfizer, which has roughly 8,000 sales representatives nationwide, had long conducted much of its training in Manhattan but sought an alternate location.

        <p>Over the years, Pfizer, the drug maker, has established a factory in Brooklyn, headquarters in Manhattan and laboratories in Connecticut. Now it has opened the Pfizer Learning Center at the Arrowwood Conference Center in Rye Brook.</p>
        <p>The center will primarily train sales representatives but will also train employees at all levels. Pfizer, which has roughly 8,000 sales representatives nationwide, had long conducted much of its training in Manhattan but sought an alternate location. Rye Brook was attractive because of its closeness to the city, Andy McCormick, a company spokesman, said.</p>
        <p>The center can accommodate more than 700 people and can broadcast training sessions to Pfizer regional offices. Pfizer operated a smaller training center at Arrowwood for several years, but the new center ''represents a major expansion and new sense of permanency in Westchester,'' Mr. McCormick said.</p>
