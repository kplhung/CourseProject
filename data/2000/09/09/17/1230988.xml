        <p>COLLECTED POEMS</p>
        <p>IN ENGLISH</p>
        <p>By Joseph Brodsky.</p>
        <p>Edited by Ann Kjellberg.</p>
        <p>540 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $30.</p>
        <p>Joseph Brodsky was a quixotic crusader in an anodyne age. Inditing his verses, he somehow indicted all of us for failing to face directly enough the brute givens of existence or, paradoxically, failing to savor the gift of freedom, which, as he wrote, can leave the mouth's saliva ''sweeter than Persian pie.''</p>
        <p>Born in Leningrad in 1940, a disaffected school dropout by his midteens, Brodsky fell afoul of the Soviet authorities almost as soon as he began putting his independent-minded poems to the page. Brought to trial for ''parasitism,'' he gained international attention when a trial transcript was smuggled out to the West. He confronted his interrogators with a fiery idealism. When he was asked who enrolled him in the ranks of the poets, Brodsky shot back: ''No one. Who enrolled me in the ranks of the human race?'' A punitive internal exile in the remote Arkhangelsk region followed.</p>
        <p>But the word on Brodsky was out. Public outcry from European and American intellectuals, as well as the powerful support of the literary icon Anna Akhmatova, who deemed him the best of the young poets, secured early release and permission to emigrate. Brodsky chose to fly to Vienna, where he was taken in by W. H. Auden, who became a tutelary figure. Auden promptly got the young poet invited to the Poetry International festival in London; there Brodsky met a galaxy of celebrated poets and shared the reading podium with Robert Lowell. After teaching at the University of Michigan for some years, Brodsky moved to New York, establishing himself as a leading figure in what became, with the emergence of poets like Czeslaw Milosz, Derek Walcott, Seamus Heaney and others, a vibrant new cosmopolitanism.</p>
        <p>The public Brodsky was a tireless human rights polemicist and denouncer of liberal pieties and cold-war-thaw apologetics. In the mid-1980's he resigned from the prestigious American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters to protest its admission of the Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, who was, in Brodsky's view, a party yes man.</p>
        <p>He was no less strident on the poetic front, setting himself up in our largely free-verse era as an autocrat of formal stricture. He had his apostles and he had more than a few enemies. In 1987, not yet 50, Brodsky was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature; four years later he was named poet laureate of the United States. In 1996, after struggling for years with heart problems, Brodsky died -- he was 55, recently married and recently a father.</p>
        <p>My sense is that Brodsky's reputation has suffered somewhat in the years since his death, at least in America. For one thing, we no longer have his passionate advocacy of his preferred poetics, not to mention the stunning vocal performances in which English translations and Russian originals were delivered in his strange throbbing vibrato. For another, his last collection, ''So Forth'' (1996), published after his death, had little of the force or inventiveness of ''A Part of Speech'' (1977), the book that made his name. In his last years, Brodsky fell prey to what some thought were his worst tendencies, indulging his love for outre wordplay and almost perversely subjecting the lyric impulse to the rack of rhyme.</p>
        <p>But now, with the publication of ''Collected Poems in English'' (with translations by many hands, including George L. Kline, Anthony Hecht, Alan Myers and Richard Wilbur), the needle of public response, having swung from adulation to a sometimes grumbling revisionism, can settle itself, measuring attainments against excesses. Here are all the poems that appeared in English in the poet's lifetime ''under his supervision,'' as well as a small group of hitherto unpublished poems. Read in sequence -- or even in punctuated immersions -- they disclose a singularly bleak sensibility refracting itself in all directions with imagistic inventiveness and, often, a darkly comic brio. The clanking of some of the later poems cannot overshadow the eye-opening intensity of the bulk of the collection.</p>
        <p>If Brodsky's public persona was that of the embattled dissenter, the scourge of shallow hypocrisies, the spirit of the work is very different. The poems impress on us an almost alarming solitude, declaring a man utterly alone in the universe -- a Beckettian wraith viewing all things as if posthumously.</p>
        <p>Years ago, Brodsky spoke in an interview about an early poetic breakthrough. While still serving his labor sentence, he one day found himself writing, ''Here on the hills, under the empty sky, on the roads leading on into the woods, life steps aside from itself and peers at itself in a state of bewilderment.'' Being able to say that, he observed, ''unleashes certain other things.''</p>
        <p>What it unleashed was an utterly singular body of subsequent work. This sense of stepping aside and peering in bewilderment is the very essence of the poet's vision. Indeed, Brodsky seldom wrote with much of a specific thematic address. His standard procedure -- with exceptions, of course -- was to cast a solitary speaker in a locale, letting him reflect on his surroundings and then discourse, in one key or another, about the metaphysics of living. And over three decades that core premise -- and the basic delivery -- scarcely changed.</p>
        <p>Here is a stanza from the 1973 poem ''Lagoon'':</p>
        <p>The gondola knocks against its moorings. Sound</p>
        <p>cancels itself, hearing and words are drowned,</p>
        <p>as is that nation where among</p>
        <p>forests of hands the tyrant of the State</p>
        <p>is voted in, its only candidate,</p>
        <p>and spit goes ice-cold on the tongue.</p>
        <p>Compare the tonality, as well as what Brodsky liked to call the essential ''plane of regard,'' with that of lines written 20 years later in ''View With a Flood'':</p>
        <p>A somewhat familiar landscape, currently flooded. Currently</p>
        <p>it's only cupolas, spires, treetops, a rainy gauze.</p>
        <p>The throat wells up with a gurgling, passionate commentary,</p>
        <p>but out of the bunch of words all that remains is was.</p>
        <p>My point is not that Brodsky did not evolve -- he grew ever more ambitious and risk-ready in some respects -- but that he arrived very early at a kind of historically removed sub specie aeternitatis perspective that is almost impossible either to push past or step down from. One does not unsee certain kinds of seeing.</p>
        <p>Brodsky's poems, then, form what feels like an almost continuous account of a profoundly detached -- and by implication wounded -- sensibility filtering the world, beholding its startling manifestations with a perfectly alienated gaze. Such alienation is the mother of metaphor; seen against a ground of final nullity, everything is, as it were, coined afresh. This is Brodsky's signature, his genius. His originality, moreover, goes beyond conjuring interesting lines: he invites us to partake in one soul's primary encounter with the order of things. Every dip of the net -- such as here, from ''In England'' (1976) -- draws up fresh exertions of perception:</p>
        <p>And the outlines of the body</p>
        <p>sink into an armchair the way sediment settles in liquid.</p>
        <p>Amid the absurdity, horror, ennui of life,</p>
        <p>beyond the windows stand the flowers, like tiny</p>
        <p>apparel somehow inside out -- a rose, symbol</p>
        <p>of infinity with its clustered eights,</p>
        <p>a dahlia's wheel, spinning between its bamboo bars</p>
        <p>like Boccioni's disheveled locomotive . . .</p>
        <p>And here, from ''Lullaby of Cape Cod'' (1975):</p>
        <p>Below me curled</p>
        <p>serpentine rivers, roads bloomed with dust, ricks yellowed,</p>
        <p>and everywhere in that diminished world,</p>
        <p>in formal opposition, near and far,</p>
        <p>lined up like print in a book about to close,</p>
        <p>armies rehearsed their games in balanced rows</p>
        <p>and cities all went dark as caviar.</p>
        <p>In lines like these, every phrase enacts the work of seeing, and every new image offers new purchase on the familiar.</p>
        <p>All of Brodsky's work, alas, is not at this level. Energized as he was by the example of Auden, in later years he increasingly followed his master down the doggerel path, enjoying overmuch the pratfall effects that result when formal constraints put a rein on the antic impulses of language. It was a deliberate sort of slumming for a poet of Brodsky's gifts. Toward the end of the collection we find too many lines like the following, from ''An Admonition'' (1986):</p>
        <p>Always pick a house with baby clothes hanging out</p>
        <p>in the yard. Deal only with the over-fifty crowd:</p>
        <p>a hick at that age knows too much about fate to gain</p>
        <p>anything by attempting to bust your brain.</p>
        <p>There is also the matter of Brodsky's lengthy madhouse dialogue, ''Gorbunov and Gorchakov,'' included here, which even this reader, a longtime fan of his work, found very hard to get through; the signal-to-noise ratio is seriously skewed to the latter, at least in English.</p>
        <p>But what is great will always displace what is lesser, and ''Collected Poems in English'' gathers up all of Brodsky's finest poems in one heftily elegant volume. Here is a rowing machine for the heart, a grueling course in the difficulties and rewards of what might be called unassisted living. How else to say it? Brodsky charged at the world with full intensity and wrestled his perceptions into lines that fairly vibrate with what they are asked to hold. There is no voice, no vision, remotely like it.</p>
