        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>John Leland's suggestion that moviegoing audiences didn't ''get''  ''This Is Spinal Tap'' in 1984, thus necessitating its rerelease, is ludicrous [''The Heavy Metal Joke Not Everyone Got,'' Sept. 3]. Certainly the sold-out audience I watched it with in the West Village laughed almost continuously, and it played both there and in theaters around the country for months.</p>
        <p>Almost instantly, lines like ''This one goes to 11'' and ''It's a fine line between clever and stupid'' became national catch phrases. Mr. Leland proposes that ''dumbfounded test audiences saw 'Spinal Tap' in the towering shadow of the Stones.''  ''Spinal Tap'' mocked the excesses of irrelevant dinosaurs like the Rolling Stones accurately and mercilessly, and even back in the dark ages of 1984, many millions of us were able to grasp that.</p>
