        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Pursuit of Less'' (Sept. 3): I've never had to pursue less; less has pursued me. I'm ready and willing to go shopping at Ann Taylor and have furniture from Ethan Allen instead of finding it at the curb, but supporting two adults and a dog (don't laugh about the dog; have you been to the vet lately?) on a teacher's salary in New York City means a futon on the floor, metal folding chairs and no microwave.</p>

        <p>Re ''The Pursuit of Less'' (Sept. 3): I've never had to pursue less; less has pursued me. I'm ready and willing to go shopping at Ann Taylor and have furniture from Ethan Allen instead of finding it at the curb, but supporting two adults and a dog (don't laugh about the dog; have you been to the vet lately?) on a teacher's salary in New York City means a futon on the floor, metal folding chairs and no microwave.</p>
        <p>I have a suggestion for all the reformed conspicuous consumers:  get certified, ease the teacher shortage and assuage your guilt. You will never have to go to work again; you will just ''go to school'' every day, the most exciting place to be from kindergarten on. And you certainly won't have to waste part of your precious paycheck on self-help manuals about simplifying your life. I guarantee it will be as basic as ABC.</p>
