        <p>Mrs. Cox, 27, works in pediatrics at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, organizing play activities for children under treatment. She graduated from Trinity College in Hartford and received a master's degree in special education in May from the Bank Street College of Education. Her mother is the director of development and community relations at the Pro Bono Partnership, an organization in White Plains that provides legal work to nonprofit groups. The bride's father was a senior vice president in the New York office of Legg Mason, a securities brokerage firm, where he oversaw over-the-counter stock trading. She is a granddaughter of Harry A. Jacobs Jr. of Irvington N.Y., who was the chief executive of Bache &amp; Company, which became Prudential Securities. She is also a descendant of William Floyd, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox, 28, is known as Chappy. He is a carpenter at Lyndhurst, the Jay Gould house and museum in Tarrytown, N.Y. He is a graduate of the University of South Carolina at Columbia. His mother is an administrative assistant at Converse College in Spartanburg, S.C.</p>
        <p>There is a Jackie Wilson song with the refrain, ''Your love keeps lifting me higher.'' In the case of the couple, who met on the slopes at Breckenridge, Colo., those lyrics are especially apt. In January 1996, Mr. Cox was a ''lifty,'' loading skiers onto the chairlifts ascending the mountains. One of the people he helped into the chairs was Ms. Haneman, who was there daily with her gaggle of a half dozen or so 6- to 12-year-old ski students. An innocent flirtation began and intensified over the course of a month.</p>
        <p>At last they both had the same day off, and Ms. Haneman invited Mr. Cox to go with her and her cousins on a ski trip to Vail, Colo., about a half-hour's drive from Breckenridge.</p>
        <p>There, while riding the chairlift together, the cousins invited Ms. Haneman and Mr. Cox (who were not yet a couple) to dinner that night.</p>
        <p>''I said I had prior plans to go to the ski school prom,'' Ms. Haneman remembered. ''My cousins turned to me and said, '' 'So, are you taking Chappy along?' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox remembers her turning to him and asking, ''So, do you want to go?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox showed up at her house that evening, with three ties in hand, and asked which she preferred: the one depicting the Three Stooges, the one with a picture of dogs playing poker or the one with Munch's painting ''The Scream.'' (They settled on the poker-playing dogs.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Haneman, who now works with young cancer patients, said that humor is particularly important to her because, she said, ''I think that life is tough and you have be able to laugh together through it.''</p>
