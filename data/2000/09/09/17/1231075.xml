        <p>The Hal-Saflieni Hypogeum, a Neolithic site in the town of Paola, Malta, reopened to the public last month after a nine-year restoration. The 6,000-year-old Hypogeum, discovered in 1902, is thought to be one of the largest and most complex examples of prehistoric rock-cut chamber tombs in Europe.</p>
        <p>The entrance has been covered by a chamber to keep the humidity and temperature at proper levels to protect the caves. Visitors enter in groups of 10 at set times.</p>
        <p>The site, built without metal tools, has three levels. There are more than 30 chambers, some with elaborate carvings, as well as paintings in ocher. The numerous statues, amulets, figures and vases found in the Hypogeum are now at the Valletta Archaeological Museum in the Maltese capital, with a small selection displayed at the site.</p>
