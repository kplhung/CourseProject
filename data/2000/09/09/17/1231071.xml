        <p>On the way to the airport for a skiing holiday in 1989, Nancy Olnick and Giorgio Spanu stopped at Sotheby's in Manhattan to pick up catalogs for the coming contemporary art sales.

        <p>On the way to the airport for a skiing holiday in 1989, Nancy Olnick and Giorgio Spanu stopped at Sotheby's in Manhattan to pick up catalogs for the coming contemporary art sales. ''There, across the salesroom, I saw a vivid blue and green Venetian hourglass in the same tonality as the flowers in my Andy Warhol painting,'' Ms. Olnick said. ''We went to investigate, and the maker's name -- Paolo Venini -- rang a bell.'' She was delighted; Mr. Spanu was not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spanu, a Sardinian-born American food-marketing specialist who became her husband in 1992, was adamant. ''You don't want this,'' he said. ''It's Murano tourist glass. In Italy we call it cheap and artsy. I've hated it since childhood.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Olnick insisted: ''No, no, this is a good thing.'' She was not certain how she knew the name Venini, one of the most prominent Murano glassmakers. Her parents had collected modern art, but not glass, for their Manhattan apartment. And the history of design was not a part of her studies as an undergraduate at Barnard College, nor as an M.B.A. student at the University of Arizona. Undeterred, she left a bid of $400, the low estimate set by the house.</p>
        <p>On their return 10 days later, Ms. Olnick found a message from Sotheby's that she had bought the hourglass. ''Skiing had been so great, I had forgotten that bid,'' she said. But when she brought the hourglass home and placed it on a table under the Warhol painting of flowers, she said, she ''got excited all over again.''</p>
        <p>And so did Mr. Spanu, albeit reluctantly. A week later, back from a business trip, he found Venetian glass on window sills all over the apartment. ''I had bought about six more pieces from the 1950's, each in a different color and exuberant shape,'' Ms. Olnick said. ''I couldn't resist. They seemed to belong in our light-filled apartment on the 33rd floor. Giorgio was shocked -- but pleasantly. His look said, 'I guess we're doing this now.' ''</p>
        <p>From then on, Mr. Spanu became a total convert and the couple pursued pieces together, assembling over 12 years one of the most distinctive collections of Murano glass in private hands. The best pieces are on view in ''Venetian Glass: 20th-Century Italian Glass From the Olnick Spanu Collection,'' an exhibition of 250 works at the American Craft Museum, 40 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, through Jan. 7.</p>
        <p>''Nancy and Giorgio instinctively chose Venetian glass that reflected the many movements in 20th-century art,'' said David Revere McFadden, chief curator at the museum. ''The designers of 20th-century Italian glass were trained mostly as architects, painters and sculptors. They made the dynamic interaction of art and industry work, turning functional forms into glass that looked like sculpture or paintings or both.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Olnick and Mr. Spanu were at first attracted to the brilliant colors of glass from the 50's and 60's, buying many more hourglasses, a half-dozen giant lollipoplike plants and Gio Ponti's striped bottles with golf-ball-size stoppers. They soon moved back in time to acquire other, less flamboyant works produced since 1913. The two earliest on view are vases by Benvenuto Barovier from World War I; they look as if they were iced with shimmering blurs of flowers, in the style of the German Expressionist painter Emil Nolde. By the 1930's, when abstract art flourished, Carlo Scarpa, the architect, magically combined his own mix of ancient Chinese forms with modern geometric ones. He further enriched the pieces with a painterly 20th-century palette, or no color at all. His works -- there are 60 -- dominate the show.</p>
        <p>Other artists embraced biomorphism -- organic forms -- in the 1940's, and glass designers did too, or at least Dino Martens and Fulvio Bianconi did. These color-splashed objects, with swooping handles, holes in the center or mysterious black squiggles, also owe much to Abstract Expressionism. Surrealism added wit and drama to both art and glass: the Miroesque birds by Alessandro Pianon and Peter Pezel look as if they had flown in from the tropics.</p>
        <p>As the Spanus' tastes changed, so did their collecting. After concentrating for a decade on works by Warhol, Lichtenstein, Ed Ruscha, George Segal and Tom Wesselman, they bought earlier modern paintings by Dubuffet, Ernst, Klee, Matisse, Miro,  Pollock and Picasso.</p>
        <p>But the couple have been tireless in their search here and abroad for Venetian glass, seeking out specialty dealers, producers and historians, including Marino Barovier, who introduced the Spanus to many European collectors and designers.</p>
        <p>THE Spanus had never met Massimo Vignelli, the famous Venitian designer who lives in New York, until Mr. McFadden introduced them a year ago. The Spanus already owned several of the 1950's classics -- a set of cylindrical glasses and pitcher, hanging lamps banded with wondrous wavy colors and a bright yellow mushroom vase -- that Mr. Vignelli had designed, working part time for Venini while he studied architecture in Venice or shortly thereafter.</p>
        <p>The Vignelli presence will be more in evidence at the exhibition than his glass. Holly Hotchner, the director, invited Mr. Vignelli and his wife, Lella Vignelli, an architect, to design the show. And Mr. Vignelli designed the catalog, which their son, Luca, photographed. It is available at the museum ($55 cloth, $45 paper).</p>
        <p>For Mr. Spanu, the collection meant many things: ''We've loved spending three to four weeks in Venice most summers with the children,'' he said. ''For me, it represents a big rooting with my past. What I love most about the glass is all this color. I never tire of it. It makes me feel loose and free and very alive. It's so Italian.''</p>
