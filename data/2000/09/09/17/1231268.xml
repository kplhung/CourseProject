        <p>The potato knish, among the most stalwart and traditional of New York street foods, has become an increasingly troublesome item for neighborhood vendors and is slowly but surely fading from the sidewalk scene.</p>
        <p>Introduced on the Lower East Side almost a century ago, the defiantly greasy potato squares remain as popular as ever and are still abundantly available in delis around the city. But in 1996, cooked potatoes were among the items added to the health department's list of potentially hazardous foods.</p>
        <p>Both vendors and the department agree that an increase in street cart inspections has made it difficult to sell knishes from vehicles that do not meet the department's strict criteria.</p>
        <p>Like certain dairy and meat products, knishes can breed bacteria that cause food-borne illnesses unless they are reheated to 165 degrees and stored at a base temperature of 140 degrees, said John Gadd, a spokesman for the department.</p>
        <p>The city has thus restricted knish sales to the big so-called processing food carts, which are equipped with a small oven for cooking, along with sinks, hot and cold running water. The carts, typically used to sell grilled meats, require a separate permit and can cost $2,000 to $3,000 more than the smaller hot dog carts, which provide only a basin that holds boiling water.</p>
        <p>''Vendors might be finding it to be more trouble than it's worth,'' Mr. Gadd said. ''But there is no prohibition, and there is no knish crackdown.''</p>
        <p>In January 1998, after Mayor Giuliani named Dr. Neal L. Cohen the Health Commissioner, food cart inspections were stepped up vigorously. At that time, all vendors received a letter reminding them which foods must be held at high temperatures and warning them to expect more frequent inspections.</p>
        <p>''Suddenly the city was going around and ticketing the vendors for carrying my knishes, saying they weren't keeping them at the right temperature,'' said Elliott Gabay, president of Gabila &amp; Sons Manufacturing, which has produced knishes for street sale since 1921.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gabay said sales of his product -- ''the original Coney Island square knish,'' according to the package -- were down at least 30 percent since 1998.</p>
        <p>Knishes are available online. Yonah Schimmel, a Lower East Side fixture since 1910, has started delivering its hearty potato cakes through Urbanfetch.com, the technology version of the man with the cap and cart.</p>
        <p>On a recent afternoon, a random survey of Midtown hot dog vendors failed to locate any knishes for sale, though many carts advertised them.</p>
        <p>''We've been selling knishes for 80 years, and all of the sudden the city came down on these poor vending guys, saying it's a hazardous item,'' Mr. Gabay said. ''My item is precooked. It has preservatives in there. I make it today; it's on the wagon tomorrow. Nobody ever got sick or died from eating a knish.''</p>
