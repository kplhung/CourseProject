        <p>JOE KELLY was mad. Very mad. His eyes darkened as he held up a copy of Seventeen magazine and waved it in front of the crowd.</p>
        <p>''Look at this cover model, Rachel Leigh Cook,'' he said, referring to the lissome 20-year-old actress who has appeared in such teenage-centric movies as ''She's All That.'' ''If Rachel Leigh Cook showed up here, you'd see she's an anomaly by how she looks. She has no pores.''</p>

        <p>JOE KELLY was mad. Very mad. His eyes darkened as he held up a copy of Seventeen magazine and waved it in front of the crowd.</p>
        <p>''Look at this cover model, Rachel Leigh Cook,'' he said, referring to the lissome 20-year-old actress who has appeared in such teenage-centric movies as ''She's All That.'' ''If Rachel Leigh Cook showed up here, you'd see she's an anomaly by how she looks. She has no pores.''</p>
        <p>He clicked on a little button and magazines popped up on a screen: YM, People, the Sports Illustrated issue with the United States women's soccer team on the cover.</p>
        <p>''S.I. does this great story on female athletes, but then you open it up,'' Mr. Kelly continued, flipping to the article and flashing it around, ''and it's not about the game. It's about their looks, boyfriends and exercise habits.'' He shook his head. The group nodded emphatically.</p>
        <p>''To me, the tragedy is the vast number of girls who feel lousy about their bodies,'' Mr. Kelly concluded. ''It's our job to stop it.''</p>
        <p>If the message sounds familiar (blasting the news media for causing women's eating and body-image disorders), it is. But Mr. Kelly is an example of how the messenger has changed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly, a roundish, bearded 45-year-old with a smiley face tie, is the founder and executive director of Dads and Daughters. His year-old organization is not only dedicated to enhancing fathers' relationships with their daughters but also, more specifically, to girls' relationships with their bodies.</p>
        <p>On this night, Mr. Kelly was speaking to 6 women and 10 men at the Renfrew Center in Midtown Manhattan, one of nine treatment centers it runs for girls with eating disorders and psychological disturbances nationwide. The night's topic was ''Raising Healthy, Confident Daughters in Today's World,'' and it focused on fathers helping their daughters deal with eating disorders.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, men have not been heralded for their sensitivity to women's body issues. But in therapy sessions, lectures and support groups around the United States, more men are trying to help their wives, girlfriends, sisters and daughters. Experts say such help may be critical to the women who need it.</p>
        <p>At the Hartford Hospital in Connecticut, Dr. Margo Maine, consulting director of eating disorders and the author of ''Father Hunger: Fathers, Daughters and Food'' (Gurze Books, 1991), says more men attend the support groups she runs. More men also show up at private therapy sessions to ''understand what an eating disorder is all about,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nancy Logue, a clinical psychologist and the director of the Renfrew Center in Yardley, Pa., and an online consultant for Renfrew's Web site, said she receives hundreds of inquiries from men concerned about a girlfriend, wife or daughter. So does Pam Guthrie, the administrative director at the American Anorexia Bulimia Association in New York. ''A lot of fathers are much more supportive than mothers,'' she said. ''Women get such pressure to look good, and a lot of mothers unwittingly pass those pressures on to their daughters.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly, a former journalist who along with his wife, Nancy Gruver, founded New Moon, a magazine for girls and edited by girls 8 to 14, became concerned with those issues while raising his twin daughters, who are now 19. Neither has had an eating disorder, but they have had their fair share of concern about physical appearance, leading Mr. Kelly to address how important a father is to a young woman's self-esteem. According to a 1997 study from the National Center for Education Statistics, girls with active, involved fathers are more successful in school and attend college more frequently. A study by the Melpomene Institute in St. Paul, Minn., which examines the relationship between sports and women's self-esteem, found that girls whose fathers encourage athletics are less likely to date or marry abusive partners. They are also less likely to have eating disorders, especially if the father is around during his daughters teenage years, a 1996 study from Loyola University of Chicago reported.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly started Dads and Daughters when a friend mentioned that his 9-year-old daughter had asked him if she looked fat.</p>
        <p>''We came to the idea that it was significant that she asked him and not her mother,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''A girl is going to want to know how to get the attention of members of the opposite sex. The first one she knows is Dad. How he responds to her and reflects back to her is incredibly important.''</p>
        <p>His nonprofit organization, based in Duluth, Minn., now has 1,600 members nationwide. Mr. Kelly lectures around the country and e-mails members a newsletter filled with tips, resources and calls to action.  They have taken aim at Maidenform Bras for an ad featuring a naked woman and the headline ''Inner beauty only goes so far.'' (''Outrageous!'' Mr. Kelly exclaimed.) ''We ran the ad about two-and-a-half years ago,'' said Manette Scheininger, a senior vice president for marketing for Maidenform in Bayonne, N.J. ''Our position is that we empower women to look better and feel better about themselves, and this ad was a return to that.''</p>
        <p>They've protested jewelry.com for an ad that pictured a woman wearing only jewelry and a bra. She was embracing a man, and the accompanied slogan said, ''Trust us, a food processor won't get you there.'' Mr. Kelly and members of the group wrote letters to the chief executive, who apologized and pulled the ad.</p>
        <p>''Fathers need to know how important they are to their daughters,'' said Dr. Maine, whose latest book is ''Body Wars: Making Peace With Women's Bodies'' (Gurze Books, 2000). ''They often feel that girls only need their moms, especially during adolescence. Yet this is the time when eating disorders are most likely to develop, so men must find positive ways to relate to their daughters.''</p>
        <p>There's good reason for men to be concerned about their daughters. Studies from the American Anorexia Bulimia Association have found that one third of 12- to 13-year-old girls are actively trying to lose weight by dieting, vomiting, using laxatives or taking diet pills; the single largest group of high school students considering or attempting suicide are girls who think they're overweight. The Council on Size and Weight Discrimination reported in 1996 that half of all American women are dieting at any one time.</p>
        <p>But some feel there is another reason for men's increased interest in body issues. Bombarded with media messages about their own physical appearances, they can now empathize with women's experiences.  ''Boys are starting to have the same images as women foisted upon them at early ages,'' Dr. Maine said.</p>
        <p>Members of Dads and Daughters, like Bob Stien, a businessman in Upper Nyack, N.Y., and the father of two girls 9 and 13, are trying hard not to replicate their own fathers' behavior, claiming that they were often absent, unavailable or simply unable to connect with their daughters.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Stien's daughters make negative comments about their hair or bodies, he compliments them, a strategy taught in Dads and Daughters.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Leder, another member, has had similar encounters with his 13-year-old daughter, who is 5 feet 8  and thinks she's too skinny. ''She'd like to have curves, and she imagines her nose is big,'' said Mr. Leder, who owns a marketing design firm in New York. ''I try to help her not judge herself against the prevailing criteria of how she's supposed to be. I tell her all this is meaningless, that it's created by people who are trying to move product.''</p>
