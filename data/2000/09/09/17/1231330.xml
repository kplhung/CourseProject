        <p>DANIELLE ANDERSON'S quest to find replacement tires for the Firestones on her Ford Explorer was coming up short. Turned away by her Ford dealer, who had no tires to offer, she wound up at the end of a waiting list at her Firestone dealer. But he could not promise new tires before Christmas.</p>
        <p>So, earlier this month, she called a local Les Schwab Tire Center in Chico, Calif., and, to her surprise, a clerk told her to come right down. ''He said: 'What are you waiting for? We've had tires all along,' '' said Mrs. Anderson, a financial-aid adviser at California State University at Chico. Ninety minutes after she drove to the store, she drove away with four new tires in the store's Grand Am house brand.</p>
        <p>Many Westerners are making similar trips. In all, the 310 Les Schwab stores in six Western states have replaced about 125,000 tires since the Firestone tire recall on Aug. 9 -- more than 10 percent of the one million light-truck tires that have been replaced nationwide. At the Chico store, which usually has about 50 customers a day, an additional 25 to 30 have been arriving daily, seeking replacements for their Firestones, said Mark Durant, the assistant manager.</p>
        <p>In fact, the reports of tread problems on tires produced by Bridgestone/Firestone, whose Japanese parent, the Bridgestone Corporation, is the world's biggest tire maker, have given Les Schwab and other retailers a unforeseen chance to pick up business.</p>
        <p>Statistics out last week show that the tire market, sluggish for most of the year, has perked up. In August, sales of replacement tires -- those installed by retailers and dealers -- rose 11 percent over August of last year, according to Michelin North America. But as of the end of July, sales for the year were up just 1 percent industrywide and tire retailers were mired in the summer doldrums, in the words of Tire Business, a trade publication.</p>
        <p>NO more. Business is now booming -- even though the strongest time for tire sales is spring, before families go on summer vacations, and late fall, when the snow-tire business picks up.</p>
        <p>At times, the demand has seemed overwhelming. Over the Labor Day weekend, all 10 service bays were full at the Firestone Tire and Service Center in West Bloomfield, Mich., where nearly 200 discarded tires lay in a growing pile. Eight customers waited in vain to get attention at the Sears Automotive Center in Ann Arbor, Mich., as the phone rang unanswered with no clerks in sight. And customers stood in line on the curb outside a Discount Tire store in Ann Arbor, waiting for service after parking their vehicles on a grass median.</p>
        <p>Some of these customers may not need to replace Firestone tires, but have become more conscious of safety as a result of the recall. The Firestone situation ''definitely has raised awareness of tires, tire care and tire maintenance,'' said Tim Galloway, an assistant vice president of Discount Tire, a retail chain.</p>
        <p>Scott Blake, vice president for marketing at Michelin North America, added, ''All retailers have an opportunity right now to pick up business, but also to focus consumers on high-quality service and high-quality brands at a time when they're a little shaken.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blake expects consumers' heightened interest in tire safety to help come October, when Michelin rolls out the Cross Terrain, its first tire designed specifically for sport utility vehicles. The company was already making the tires before the Firestone recall, but has accelerated production to meet what Michelin hopes will be strong demand.</p>
        <p>Surveys conducted by CNW Marketing Research, which tracks consumer behavior, show that more and more buyers are shunning Firestone tires for Michelin and other brands. Data released on Tuesday showed that only 4 percent of shoppers said they would consider buying Firestone tires, down from 21 percent just after the recall. By contrast, 55 percent of consumers were considering buying Goodyear tires, up from about 37 percent in mid-August, while 35 percent said they would consider buying Michelins, compared with 18 percent a month ago.</p>
        <p>For Les Schwab, its long history of selling Firestones gave it a head start in preparing for the recall, said Richard Borgman, an executive vice president. When word of the tire problems first surfaced this summer, Les Schwab dealers had already fielded several hundred phone calls from consumers.</p>
        <p>Thus, ahead of its competition, Les Schwab was stocking thousands of extra tires and adding work shifts at its 42,000-square foot warehouse in Prineville, Ore. It has also signed up independent truck drivers and assigned overtime for its own crew of drivers. White-collar employees are pitching in, too, Mr. Borgman said.</p>
        <p>''We're all working,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Chico, Mr. Durant said the situation after the recall was no more hectic than the snow emergencies he had encountered in his previous Les Schwab assignment, at a store in Oregon. As snowstorms threaten, he said, drivers who must travel through mountains descend upon stores to buy ice-fighting studded tires.</p>
        <p>''To me, the Firestone thing is just another day,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As Mrs. Anderson found, Les Schwab is not charging consumers for replacement tires, so long as the price does not exceed the $100-a-tire reimbursement that Firestone will pay. Les Schwab stores are also disposing of the old tires for customers, so they do not have to take them to a Firestone dealer. Mr. Borgman said he expects Firestone will reimburse Les Schwab for the replaced tires, a bill that at the moment exceeds $12.5 million.</p>
        <p>SO far, tire stores do not appear to be using the Firestone recall to raise prices.</p>
        <p>''They can't gouge customers or they will be seen as taking advantage of a bad situation,'' said Gregory Kagay, an auto parts analyst at PaineWebber, adding that the industry had been burdened with high inventories.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Borgman said, Les Schwab has cut prices on the Grand Am line of tires that Mrs. Anderson selected. Sears Auto Centers across the country are offering specials on Goodyear and Dunlop brand sport utility tires, while Michelin is offering a roadside assistance kit to consumers who buy four of any one tire. Mr. Blake said  Michelin wanted to encourage customers to keep buying.</p>
        <p>''This will certainly help,'' he said of the jump in business. ''But there is a lot more demand to capture.''</p>
        <p>BUSINESS  Correction:  September 24, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about the effects of Firestone's tire recall on the business of its competitors misstated the surname of a vice president for marketing at one such company, Michelin North America. He is Scott Clark, not Scott Blake.</p>
