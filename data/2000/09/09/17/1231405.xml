        <p>The traditional Politiken Cup International Open Tournament in Copenhagen, July 17-28, was won jointly by Boris Gulko of Fairlawn, N.J., Lars Bo Hansen of Denmark and Jonny Hector of Sweden.</p>
        <p>The three grandmasters each scored 8 1/2 points in the 11-round, 165-entrant competition. The American grandmaster Nick DeFirmian, who lives in Copenhagen, scored 8 points for a seven-way tie for 4th to 10th places.</p>
        <p>Gulko, who enjoys the distinction of being a former champion of both the U.S.S.R. and the United States, was in good form in his Round 3 game with the international master Bjorn Brinck Claussen of Denmark. He picked one of the most tortuous openings in chess and wove his way through it with great style.</p>
        <p>Developing the white queen bishop with 5 Bg5 introduces the Anti-Meran Gambit in the Semi-Slav Defense. This aggressively bypasses the Meran Variation, which arises after 5 e3 Nbd7 6 Bd3 dc 7 Bc4 b5 Bd3 a6. White is first to sacrifice a pawn, but who is really giving up material remains unclear until after manifold skirmishing.</p>
        <p>After 9 Ng5, the major alternative to 9 . . . hg is 9 . . . Nd5, but in a game in Merida, Mexico, last year, Gulko crushed Reynaldo Vera with 10 Nf7 Qh4 11 Nh8 Bb4 12 Rc1 c5 13 dc Nd7 14 Be2 Ne5 15 O-O Bb7 16 Nb5 Rd8 17 Qa4 Nf4 18 Nd4 Kf8 19 Ne6! Ne6 20 Qb4 Bc6 21 f4 Kg8 22 Qe1 Qe1 23 Rce1 Resigns.</p>
        <p>Black's strategy became visible after 12 . . . c5. White cannot play 13 dc?! because Black would mobilize powerfully with 13 . . . Nc5 followed by 14 . . . Bb7 and 15 . . . Rd8. However, White has at his disposal the combative thrust 13 d5.</p>
        <p>Currently, sacrificing a piece with 16 Rb1! is the favored strategem. After 16 . . . Bh6 17 Bh6 Rh6, White's 18 b3! opens terrain for an attack on the enemy king.</p>
        <p>Through 21 . . . Qb2, the players were following a Khalifman-Galkin game in Elista 1998, but even though White won that one, beginning with 22 e7, Gulko displayed confidence in proceeding with 22 ed7!? He was now revising a Novikov-Ivanov game in St. Petersburg 1996, which went 22 . . . Rd7, but instead of 23 Qf3, which led to a draw after c2 24 Qc6 Kd8 25 Qa8 Kc7 26 Qc6, he produced his secret weapon: 23 Qg4!</p>
        <p>After 27 Bd7 Kd7, Gulko had recovered his material and the black king was exposed, whereas the white king was safe. Brinck Claussen's threat was his far-advanced passed c pawn.</p>
        <p>After 28 Re1, Brinck Claussen could not advance 28 . . . c2 because of 29 Qe8 Kc7 30 Re7 Kb6 31 Qb8. After 28 . . . Re6 29 Rd1 Rd6 30 Qf5 Ke7 31 Qe5 Re6 32 Qg5 f6 33 Qg7 Ke8, 34 Qd7 wins.</p>
        <p>After 39 Rb1, there was no way to stop 40 Qb7mate or 40 Qb5mate other than to sacrifice the queen with 39 . . . Qb1 40 Qb1.</p>
        <p>After 42 Qd4, there could have come 42 . . . Kb4 43 Qb2 Ka5 44 Qc3, and the black pawns are going nowhere. Brinck Claussen gave up.</p>
