        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Ken Foster sure seems to watch a lot of television and old movies. If Brad Barkley had written a screenplay instead of a novel (''Money, Love,'' Aug. 27), Foster's comparisons to Peter Bogdanovich's films, Jill Clayburgh and television reruns might have been instructive. As a reader and writer, though, I prefer my reviews from people who compare books to books, at least more often than not. Is your choice of reviewers a sign that you think books are so much on the wane that they can be judged only in terms of electronic entertainment?</p>
