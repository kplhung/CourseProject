        <p>LONGING</p>
        <p>By J. D. Landis.</p>
        <p>446 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Harcourt. $26.</p>
        <p>''I would like to be consumed by something,'' says the young Robert Schumann to his chronically ill older sister early in J. D. Landis's penetrating fictional biography of the Romantic composer. He spends the rest of the novel attempting to find things that might not only consume but devour him. In the course of an impassioned and highly engaged life he tries many, before being finally and wholly ravaged by madness and dying a pitiful early death in an insane asylum.</p>
        <p>Between his beginning and his end, Schumann lived the life of the perfect Romantic: passionate, flamboyant and always a little bit crazy. Most famously, he thwarted his career as a concert pianist by crippling his right hand in a vain attempt to stretch the tendons that would have given him a wider reach across the keyboard. But this was only the most dramatic of a number of excesses. Composer, music theorist and critic, hypochondriac, lover and, at the last, victim of his own demons, Schumann was an absolutist in all things, from his fondness for cigars to his fondness for beautiful young men.</p>
        <p>Naturally, Schumann's greatest obsession was music, but a close (and related) second was Clara Wieck. The daughter of his piano teacher, the relentless taskmaster Friedrich Wieck, Clara first met Robert when she was a child of 8 and he a young law student. Though the study of law would prove only a temporary diversion, undertaken at his mother's insistence, Clara would not. The bond between them grew into one of the great passions of a most passionate age.</p>
        <p>It would become so to the dismay of Friedrich Wieck, a man with ''the sense of humor of a gargoyle,'' whose fierce ambition was to make his daughter a pianist to rival Chopin and Liszt. In this he succeeded, fighting Robert every step of the way, at least in his own mind. ''I cannot let you enslave her,'' he tells his prospective son-in-law, while fully intending to keep Clara locked in chains of his own manufacture.</p>
        <p>History tells us that Friedrich Wieck failed in his efforts to keep the two lovers apart. Landis tells us that their eventual marriage was vivid, full of humor, vitality and a great hunger for music. Enriching their lives (and the novel) is the artistic cream of the century. Mendelssohn, Berlioz, Wagner, Hans Christian Andersen, Kierkegaard, Jenny Lind, Heine and Goethe all pass through the narrative. But the Schumanns' union falls increasingly under the thrall of Robert's mental disintegration. Conducting a mass in Dsseldorf, he continues moving his arms after the music has ceased, drawing the tempo from his own head. At home, he attempts to give music lessons to a table, throws books at Clara and has increasingly bizarre visions. Finally, he hurls his wedding ring into the frigid Rhine and jumps in after it.</p>
        <p>This last act lands Robert in an asylum, where he spends his remaining days, with Clara prevented from visiting by the doctor in charge of his care. The final links between the two are their memories and Johannes Brahms, the last of his beautiful young men, who acts as a conduit between them and is also possibly Clara's lover.</p>
        <p>Schumann's story is told as a semi-formal biography, filled with footnotes (one of which manages to tie together Franz Liszt, Artur Rubinstein, Vladimir Horowitz, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young and Billie Holiday), nicely constructed pseudo-academic digressions and some provocative asides about art and creativity. Landis, whose last novel (''Lying in Bed'') was an ingenious, if somewhat discursive, consideration of love and obsession, has here written what looks at first glance like a chronological, factual account with hardly any invention. But the result is not just biography with a thin veneer of embellishment. In the end, ''Longing'' remains very much a work of fiction.</p>
        <p>Landis has seamlessly interwoven his text with ideas (about language and music, genius, imagination and the nature of human devotion) that are very much his own. The strikingly original narrative that he has constructed, while it may present the facts, is about much more than facts alone.</p>
        <p>Of course, music dominates. Unexpressed melodies seem to move beneath the events of the novel like</p>
        <p>the undertones that run through Robert Schumann's brain. Even conversations are constructed like musical compositions, infused with melodic elements. In fact, as the final curtain of madness is drawn across the composer's life, the whole oratorio of self-destruction concludes with discussions between Robert and his bewildered doctor that are filled with themes and variations, progressions and discordant strains. It is almost as if Landis himself were conducting a score, with the two characters his human instruments.</p>
