        <p>HWA-SHIH LEE and Reginald Tucker, both 25, have known each other for years, since meeting as first-year students at New York University. They had been living together in rentals and decided it was time to buy their first place.</p>
        <p>Like most people, their biggest concern was finding something they could afford; they needed a place for less than $200,000. But they also wondered whether -- despite antidiscrimination laws -- some people would react negatively to an unmarried interracial couple. Once, Ms. Lee said, a Chinese-American landlord agreed to rent them an apartment, then backed out when she met Mr. Lee, an African-American.</p>
        <p>When they found an ad for an appealing-sounding one-bedroom apartment on Avenue C near Ninth Street, though, they thought there might be different issues. It occurred to Mr. Tucker that his job as a stock trader would brand him as too capitalistic. This is a neighborhood  where graffiti saying ''Die Yuppie Scum'' still decorate some buildings.</p>
        <p>But even before they saw the apartment, they liked the idea of living in Alphabet City. They were renting a place on the Upper East Side, and before that had lived in Brooklyn, in Carroll Gardens. They definitely wanted to be in downtown Manhattan. In Brooklyn, Ms. Lee said, ''Things close down at 10. I get sort of lazy. I'll end up staying home and doing nothing.''</p>
        <p>With the usual parade of aspiring apartment buyers, they went to an open house at the building, a small, well maintained walkup. The neighborhood had changed drastically since their first year at N.Y.U. in 1993, when students generally didn't go that far east because there wasn't enough to lure them, and it wasn't considered so safe. Now, there are restaurants on every block, and cleaner streets.</p>
        <p>THEY immediately liked the apartment, which is light and well laid out, with a hallway, bedroom, living room, small kitchen, and even a small separate room that Mr. Tucker could use to play keyboard and produce tapes, one of his hobbies. They talked to the owners, who explained that there were just nine shareholders, and they were looking for compatible people to join the group. ''They said, 'We like you guys,' '' Ms. Lee said. ''They said some of the people they showed it to they wouldn't have considered selling to.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lee said the building likes to have a diversity of styles among its residents, and the owners also seemed to be looking for people with personality. Whatever the test, they clearly passed. They made an offer of $180,000 on the apartment, which has a monthly maintenance of $312. It was accepted, and then they went for the final hurdle: the meeting with the co-op board.</p>
        <p>''We met almost everybody,'' Ms. Lee said. They wanted to know whether they would be active in the co-op, and, Ms. Lee said, ''they actually called all of our references.''</p>
        <p>The board asked them, too, what they liked to do, and how they saw themselves. Mr. Tucker said he explained that his work self and his home self are not the same. ''A lot of people know me as the loud, boisterous trader,'' he said. ''You definitely have to make your presence known.'' But outside of work, he said, he's laid back, and he likes to relax.</p>
        <p>''I like to be calm,'' he said. ''I told them, 'I'm not the first person to talk about the market.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lee, who works in advertising for Datek Online, an online brokerage, said she too tries to keep her job in perspective. ''My hours are pretty decent because I believe in having a life outside of work,'' she said.</p>
        <p>They passed that test as well, and in June moved into their apartment. Mr. Tucker and a friend refinished the floor, an unexpectedly grueling job. At a restaurant-supply store in the Bowery they found a high square table that makes a perfect computer table in the bedroom. And they even picked up a good chair with just one broken piece that had been thrown out in front of a Pier One store. A beautiful Mitchell Gold sofa was found online for less than it would have cost in a store. Eventually, they plan to rip out the kitchen and put in new cabinets from Ikea.</p>
        <p>THE neighborhood has not disappointed them. ''They've got all these cool hip bars, and the bodegas,'' Ms. Lee said. ''There's a mix of income and people. I like that.'' But their best view on the constantly changing area is from their living room window.</p>
        <p>''I tell people that the neighborhood depends on the time of day,'' Mr. Tucker said. On certain days, he'll see Land Rovers pulling up to Esperanto, the hip Pan-Latin restaurant on the corner. But down the street is a building still occupied by squatters, and across the street is a community garden. ''One second, you're in SoHo,'' he said -- and well, the next, you're not: ''It's better than watching TV.''</p>
        <p>They have made good on their promise to participate in their new co-op, which calls itself Home at Last. At the annual meeting, even before they moved into their new home, Ms. Lee became an officer. She is the new secretary.</p>
