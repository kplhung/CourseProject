        <p>NO GOOD-BYES</p>
        <p>By Elaine Kagan.</p>
        <p>Morrow, $24.</p>
        <p>''She flew into the air like she was a stuntman, they had the number of feet in the newspapers,'' a 25-year-old actress named Chassi tells her psychotherapist, describing her mother's death when a car careered into her outside a restaurant in Rome. Since Chassi's mother was the Hollywood legend Sally Brash, the story was international news, although no one but Chassi knows what took place between mother and daughter directly before the accident. It's a secret she's harbored for 14 years; it's why she's suffering from dizzy spells; it's the reason she's seeing Dr. Eleanor Costello, who has been estranged from her own daughter since the death of her husband; and it's why Dr. Costello, enveloped in her own mourning, takes a special interest in her young patient. Into this mix arrives a third character: Ionie St. John, a struggling, hugely ambitious young woman who wants to be the next Sally Brash. In the meantime, she's a waitress at the Cuppa Joe, where she befriends the withdrawn Chassi, who eventually becomes Ionie's ticket to ride. Elaine Kagan -- who is an actress living in Los Angeles, and whose previous novels are ''The Girls,'' ''Blue Heaven'' and ''Somebody's Baby'' -- intertwines these story lines while tossing out luscious details about how life is lived in the movie capital of the world. Kagan's portrait of Chassi and her mother is the most emotionally engaging, revealing, as it does, both the intricacies of the psychoanalytic process and the chilling depths of guilt and bereavement.</p>
