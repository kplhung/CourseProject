        <p>What students of the New York accent now categorize as ''first-stage Slurvian'' was reported in the 1938 Federal Writers Project ''Almanac for New Yorkers.'' An example given was onnafyah.</p>
        <p>The definition of onnafyah, as consumers of hurried meals in Manhattan know, is ''a short order is being prepared.'' The metaphor of a burger sizzling on the grill has since been extended to a more general ''it'll be ready in a minute,'' whether or not applied to food. This brings to mind another first-stage Slurvian expression, jeet?, a quick way of asking someone if he has eaten.</p>
        <p>Slurvian is not limited to New York City. The most famous example of slurred speech embodied in dialect is the Southern y'all, which has its equivalent in New York Slurvian alluhyuz. (That's if the emphasis is on the all; if the speaker wishes to stress the plural you, the phrase becomes alluhyooz.) And in California, g'yonit signifies ''get on it,'' meaning ''get moving.''</p>
        <p>These amalgams and other familiar interrogatory compressions -- tsamatta?, hootoadjadat?, whaddyanutz? -- have no meaning other than the phrases when separated: ''What's the matter? Who told you that? What are you, nuts?'' Of greater semantic interest are the phrases that gain a separate sense when deliberately slurred. We will now consider ''second-stage Slurvian.''</p>
        <p>Linguists will not soon forget fuggedaboudit. Although the transliteration of the New Yorkese phrase has appeared on T-shirts around the country, the expression is not being dropped by Noo Yawkiz, which so often happens when a dialect phrase becomes adopted by outsiders. That is because the slurred words do not mean only the literal ''forget about it''; rather, the phrase is second-stage Slurvian for ''don't bother me with that'' or a more figurative ''it'll be a cold day in hell before I buy that cockamamie notion.''</p>
        <p>The closest Slurvian synonym to fuggedaboudit is gedaddaheeuh, which long ago lost its initial meaning of ''leave the premises'' and now conveys disbelief shot through with an abiding disdain. Standing alone, gedaddaheeuh means ''I don't believe you'' or the more vivid ''don't give me that baloney.'' But when used in the start of a sentence like ''Gedaddaheeuh wid yer fancy talk,'' the disbelief turns to vehement rejection, in the sense of ''I vigorously reject your highfalutin language.''</p>
        <p>The sense of the compressed phrase is no longer the sum of its individual words; the compressed phrase conveys a meaning all its own. Another example of the semantic change called ''figurative extension'' that grew out of New York speedspeech is noprollem, which originally meant ''I can do it easily'' but now can be a modest response to gratitude with the primary sense of ''you're welcome.''</p>
        <p>Derision at such elision is misplaced. The University of Pennsylvania's William Labov, whose classic 1966 study, ''The Social Stratification of English in New York City,'' demonstrated that the city is a melting pot of various dialects, should be delighted. (I have been unable to pinpoint the locale of gerareheeuh, a variant of gedaddaheeuh; fresh street research is needed.)</p>
        <p>The lexicographer Sol Steinmetz notes that the Brooklyn accent differs from Noo Yawkese: ''Oily boid is Brooklynese,'' he says, ''as any Manhattanite or Bronxite will inform you in no unsoyten toyms. There is no standard New York pronunciation of words like car, bad and off. What we think of as 'New Yorkese' is the least prestigious of the various social dialects, or the one that differs or deviates most from standard American English. That is why New York speech has a low prestige even among its own speakers.''</p>
        <p>Off. I just pronounced that as I wrote it, and it sounded like ''awf,'' as in awful, not like ''off'' as in offal. For help on this, I turned to the pronunciation maven Charles Harrington Elster, author of ''Is There a Cow in Moscow?'' (Yes, but there is no zoo in zo-ology.)</p>
        <p>''New York tawk features a diphthongal aw sound,'' Elster observes, ''that in heavy New Yorkese sounds almost disyllabic.'' (Before a Parisian reader of this column in The International Herald Tribune expostulates, Gedaddaheeuh avec ton baratin,'' let me translate. A diphthong is the gliding sound of combining vowels, as in the oy in the head-smacking Yiddish oy veh. Disyllabic means ''having two syllables.'') ''It's impossible for me to transliterate this elongated aw here, but ask a dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker to pronounce dog and coffee and you'll come close.</p>
        <p>''New Yorkers are also renowned r-droppers,'' Elster says. ''Day eat wid a fawk, day walk onna flaw, an day drink adda bah. The superintendent of their apartment building is da soopuh, and The New York Times is da paypuh.'' He agrees that ''their propensity for slurvy pronunciation can sometimes be nothing short of miraculous. When I lived in New York, I remember how conductors on the Long Island Rail Road managed to slur the name of a certain station, Woodside, into the unintelligible wuss-eye (the eye of a wuss?).''</p>
        <p>Big Applesource  Controversy rages over who coined ''the Big Apple'' as a moniker for New York.</p>
        <p>The earliest citation is in Edward Martin's 1909 book, ''The Wayfarer in New York.'' Martin, a founder of the Harvard Lampoon and first editor of the humor magazine Life, was writing about the attitude of the Midwest toward the metropolis: ''Kansas is apt to see in New York a greedy city. . . . It inclines to think that the big apple gets a disproportionate share of the national sap.''</p>
        <p>The Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang notes an absence of capitalization or quotation marks in this citation and thinks it ''probable that the 1909 quotation represents a metaphorical or perhaps proverbial usage, rather than a concrete example of the later slang term.'' I dunno about that; capitalization is not necessary in coinage, and quotation marks only would suggest an earlier use.</p>
        <p>The etymologist Barry Popik, with fresh support from the phrase detectives Fred Shapiro and Gerald Cohen, has long been campaigning to give coinage honors to John J. Fitzgerald, a turf writer. He wrote in The New York Morning Telegraph on Feb. 18, 1924: ''There's only one Big Apple. That's New York.'' After Fitzgerald popularized the term, crediting it to African-American stable hands in New Orleans in 1920, the columnist Walter Winchell picked it up in 1927. A decade later it became the name of a Harlem nightclub and a dance.</p>
        <p>Popik makes a strong case, but I'd credit Martin with coinage and Fitzgerald with independent recoinage and early popularization. But you pays yer money and you takes yer cherce (from an 1846 cartoon in the British magazine Punch).</p>
