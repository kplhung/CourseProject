        <p>The urge to say that CBS Sports has egg on its face is strong, but that would be sophomoric wordplay. So here are the simple facts. The network has been dubbing recorded bird sounds into the background of televised golf tournaments, and some clever bird watchers figured it out.</p>
        <p>One was YuLee Larner, a former president of the Virginia Ornithological Society, who was delighted to hear the song of the white-throated sparrow in the broadcast of a tournament in Colorado last month, but then  got to thinking. ''I thought it was unusual that those birds would sing so consistently and at so many places on the golf course,'' she said. ''Then I started to wonder whether the white-throated sparrow should even be in Colorado.'' It shouldn't.</p>

        <p>The urge to say that CBS Sports has egg on its face is strong, but that would be sophomoric wordplay. So here are the simple facts. The network has been dubbing recorded bird sounds into the background of televised golf tournaments, and some clever bird watchers figured it out.</p>
        <p>One was YuLee Larner, a former president of the Virginia Ornithological Society, who was delighted to hear the song of the white-throated sparrow in the broadcast of a tournament in Colorado last month, but then  got to thinking. ''I thought it was unusual that those birds would sing so consistently and at so many places on the golf course,'' she said. ''Then I started to wonder whether the white-throated sparrow should even be in Colorado.'' It shouldn't.</p>
        <p>The following weekend, the same birdsong turned up at a tournament in Michigan, she said. It shouldn't be there either.</p>
        <p>Then came a Kentucky tournament, and the sounds of the hermit thrush, which has no business being there at all. Others noticed, too, and soon an Internet chat site for bird watchers was full of cluck-clucking.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for CBS sports acknowledged that recorded bird sounds were sometimes used, but said that the practice has ended.</p>
        <p>Indeed it has, Ms. Larner lamented. There was hardly a bird to be heard on a broadcast from Ohio recently. ''I know they were taped, but they sing such a beautiful song,'' she said. ''When they didn't sing in Akron, I kind of missed it.''</p>
        <p>Not to worry. A source at CBS said that technicians sometimes spread birdseed around microphones set on the ground to try to generate some real live ambience.</p>

        <p>Correction:  September 24, 2000, Sunday  A picture last Sunday with a brief article about the use of recorded bird sounds in televised golf tournaments was published in error. It showed a house sparrow; the birds heard on the telecasts included white-throated sparrows and hermit thrushes.</p>
