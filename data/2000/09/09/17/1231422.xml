        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, confounding predictions that he would take the weekend off, briskly marched 23 blocks up Fifth Avenue yesterday afternoon. The only sign that he had had radioactive seeds implanted in his prostate gland a day earlier was his staying away from children.</p>
        <p>The mayor joined the Steuben Day parade alongside George M. Steinbrenner 3rd, the Yankees' principal owner, and Rick A. Lazio, the Senate candidate, both of whom said they were impressed to see him at the parade, which he has participated in for many years. The day honors Baron von Steuben, who served with Washington during the Revolutionary War, and German heritage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinbrenner said, ''We've got a courageous son of a gun as mayor of this city.''</p>
        <p>The mayor was joined during the parade by his friend Judith Nathan. Mr. Giuliani waved and accepted hugs from well-wishers.</p>
        <p>In a news conference after the parade, he said was grateful to the Mount Sinai doctors who had treated him for prostate cancer. He said he was ''not in unbearable pain'' and had found the treatment to have fewer side affects than he thought might occur.</p>
        <p>The mayor joked that he decided to join the parade after hearing that Mr. Steinbrenner would be there.</p>
        <p>''I am actually a little confused,'' he said. ''I heard George Steinbrenner was going to march and I assumed it was a Yankee victory parade, and I wouldn't miss that.''</p>
