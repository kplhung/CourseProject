        <p>Simon Whitfield of Canada had climbed from the 61-degree waters of Sydney Harbor more than an hour earlier, an afterthought at the time in the first men's Olympic triathlon. By the end of the second stage, the bike leg, he was still more than a minute from contention. But in the 77-degree temperatures of the 10-kilometer run, he had coolly and methodically charged within sight of the lead.</p>
        <p>And now, with 800 meters to go, he was 40 meters back of the leader and one of the favorites, Stephan Vuckovic of Germany.</p>
        <p>Vuckovic, however, wasn't even bothering to look over his shoulder at Whitfield. And why should he? He knew that all the other  favorites were nearly a minute behind him.</p>
        <p>It was an unlikely time for the 25-year-old Whitfield, who lists his athletic hero as Wayne Gretzky, to make the move that would win the Olympic men's triathlon.</p>
        <p>But Whitfield knew what Vuckovic did not, that he was sure he could have caught Vuckovic if the gap were three times as big. Whitfield glided to victory as if he were ice, and not the steamy pavement of Sydney's sunny streets. For a morning in the 2000 Games, Whitfield was the Great One.</p>
        <p>''I felt sure the race was mine because one thing I have confidence in is my ability to sprint,'' Whitfield said later, after he caught Vuckovic with about 200 meters to go and finished 1 hour 48 minutes 24 seconds after his dive into the harbor. ''I felt nothing but elation and I was sure I could have sprinted another two minutes if I had to.</p>
        <p>''My coach told me great things happen and that's what I thought to myself: great things happen.''</p>
        <p>The race was a highly tactical one featuring spurts by some of the sport's better-known names -- all of whom failed to create a gap big enough to win. In the end, it was Whitfield and his late charge that led to the gold -- and an emotional ceremony.</p>
        <p>''You tell yourself not to cry,'' Whitfield, a Canadian native who trains in Sydney and whose father is Australian, said. ''But I couldn't help it.''</p>
        <p>Vuckovic, stopping to shake hands with the crowd and to grab a German flag after Whitfield passed him, finished 13.56 seconds behind the winner. Jan Rehula of the Czech Republic won the bronze medal.</p>
        <p>As they did for the women's triathlon, thousands of Australians turned out today  for the competition that circled the Sydney Opera House, a place of great symbolism for these Games. But while the Aussie Craig Walton emerged from the swim first, he would wane in the run and finish 27th. His teammate Miles Stewart was the top finisher for the home team in sixth.</p>
        <p>The Australian Peter Robertson, who won when the Sydney course was used for a World Cup event last April, lagged in the swim and never recovered in finishing 34th, more than three minutes back of Whitfield. The four-time world champion Simon Lessing of Britain was ninth.</p>
        <p>Robertson and Lessing were not alone when it came to wilting on this sunny day. The world champion Olivier Marceau of France made a break at the end of the bike leg, taking a 56-second lead into the run over the bulk of the field. It seemed at the time suicide for the rest of the competitors to have spotted Marceau so big a lead.</p>
        <p>But Marceau had left his best for the first two legs and would finish seventh. The American entrants were delayed by two crashes in the bike stage. Hunter Kemper was the top American, at 17th.</p>
