        <p>BEER AND CIRCUS</p>
        <p>How Big-Time College Sports</p>
        <p>Is Crippling Undergraduate Education.</p>
        <p>By Murray Sperber.</p>
        <p>322 pp. New York: Henry Holt &amp; Company. $26.</p>
        <p>THE title is from Juvenal: panem et circenses, bread and circuses (that is, public spectacles). Looking out over the bleak cultural landscape of Rome in the late first and early second centuries A.D., the great satirist concluded that these were the only two things that seemed to interest the majority of his countrymen. How different, Murray Sperber seems to be asking, are things for the American empire today?</p>
        <p>It's an interesting question, and although Sperber doesn't pursue the comparison much beyond his Juvenalian title, the material he collects in ''Beer and Circus'' is very suggestive. American college students, particularly at big-time universities, are caught up in a triad of alcohol, spectator sports and partying, which, Sperber tells us, now occupies the ''academic'' career of vast numbers of undergraduates. This is in turn tied to the promotion of research at the expense of teaching; huge lecture classes (typically taught by teaching assistants); high levels of cheating; rampant grade inflation; and a cynical, if tacit, ''nonaggression pact'' between students and faculty to stay out of each other's way. In an argument that comes fairly close to conspiracy theory, Sperber asserts that none of this is accidental. Since the big-time universities aim to acquire status and prestige through expensive research programs, they can no longer afford to give the majority of their undergraduates a meaningful education. Hence, they substitute beer and circus to keep the students distracted and the tuition dollars rolling in, in a way that is perhaps no less cynical than the bread-and-circus constellation of ancient Rome.</p>
        <p>The result? More than 56 percent of our college graduates are unable to calculate the change from $3 after buying a 60-cent bowl of soup and a $1.95 sandwich. Almost 40 percent take no courses in English or American literature, and 58 percent never study a foreign language. Nearly 31 percent have never taken a math course, and huge numbers of them cannot read and understand a simple set of directions. Add to this the fact that a de facto open admissions policy is now widespread throughout the United States, such that more than 80 percent of American colleges and universities admit virtually all their applicants, who are then processed through to what can only be called meaningless degrees.</p>
        <p>How did we come to such a pass? asks Sperber, a professor of English and American studies at Indiana University. Sports, he claims, is the real culprit in this drama, in the form of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which has the ability to force schools into enlarging their sports programs and facilities. By making a deal in 1979 with the new cable network, ESPN, the N.C.A.A. was able to generate ''wall-to-wall media coverage of college sports,'' Sperber writes. ''This marked a new phenomenon in higher education, one that subsequently became central to student life.'' Education, not surprisingly, got left behind in the dust.</p>
        <p>It is hard to read Sperber's book without having a sinking feeling about the future of American culture. He has managed to document one facet of our national decline in painstaking detail, and the result is an admirable, timely and profoundly disturbing work. Yet in the end, the argument does not really show causation. It is more a case of confluence of factors than one of direct connection, and Sperber occasionally says as much. Thus at one point he refers to the link between sports and the sorry state of undergraduate education as one of ''synergy,'' tells us that his results ''should be regarded as anecdotal, not scientific, evidence'' and states that it is impossible to separate cause and effect.</p>
        <p>He also acknowledges that the ''problems in American undergraduate education transcend big-time college sports,'' but says that he has chosen to focus on the latter rather than try to write about ''the whole mess.'' These are important qualifications; the problem is that ''the whole mess'' cannot be ignored without obfuscating what the deeper causes -- which I believe are structural in nature -- really are. These causes emerge in a rather desultory fashion in the book, but at least they are there, ineluctably drawing the reader to a different conclusion than the one Sperber specifically intended.</p>
        <p>The problem here is not sports, but the increasing domination of our educational system by the massive corporate-commercial culture that has consolidated itself during the last 15 or 20 years. When college enrollments began to drop in the late 1970's, schools started marketing themselves, and within a few years were referring to students as ''customers'' and then ''consumers.'' Obtaining these ''buyers'' became paramount, and admissions recruiters began to use corporate language as a matter of course (''closing a deal'' with a prospective student). Open admissions, grade inflation, big sports programs, huge lecture classes, the pursuit of research fame, the building of student entertainment centers on campus to the neglect of libraries and classrooms, the rapid expansion of university administrations -- all of this moves within the orbit of the new corporate-commercial paradigm that has come to define the United States over the last two decades.</p>
        <p>That Sperber does not really regard the sports-education link as causal can be seen in his six proposals at the conclusion of the book: five of them have nothing whatever to do with sports. Thus he suggests that the large public universities should ''slim down,'' losing millions of students, and ''offer quality undergraduate education to all students who legitimately qualify for entrance''; that faculty should be hired and rewarded primarily for teaching undergraduates and that all undergraduates be required to attain a minimum score on the Graduate Record Examination before being allowed to graduate. The only proposal Sperber offers relevant to the sports question is that of eliminating athletic scholarships in favor of need-based grants.</p>
        <p>Another quotation for which Juvenal became famous besides ''bread and circuses,'' and one that is equally relevant to us today, is Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Who will guard the guards themselves? This, I believe, is the real key to the situation Sperber describes, because beer and circus are only the byproduct of a culture that has been dumbed down by the triumph of the corporate-commercial way of life. Until we address Juvenal's question, very little of a substantive nature can be done about sports, education or indeed much else in America of the 21st century.</p>
