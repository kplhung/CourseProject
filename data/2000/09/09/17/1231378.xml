        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Beating the Market, Until Expenses Pile Up,'' (Strategies, Sept. 3), which cited a study that said management fees and other costs drove the average return of mutual funds below that of the market:</p>
        <p>As a financial consultant, I think the column could erroneously influence investors wanting to rationalize their own asset management skills.</p>
        <p>The point that management fees are lost money is as absurd as patients controlling medical expenses by acting as their own doctor.</p>
        <p>I am often confronted with the poorly performing portfolios of shortsighted people who thought they could save money, and maybe beat the market, by making their own decisions. The reality is far different.</p>
        <p>A wise investor knows that theoretical and real returns are not the same, and that the odds of duplicating the choices and the buy-hold-sell  timing of portfolio managers are not easy. The cost of professionalism is usually worth the long-term results.</p>
