        <p>''I'M Mark Antony, damn it!'' proclaims romantic lead Robert Cuccioli during a recent rehearsal for the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival's production of ''Antony &amp; Cleopatra.''</p>
        <p>The introduction hardly seems necessary. Powerful, masculine, sexy and riveting, Mr. Cuccioli naturally embodies what audiences have come to expect from this timeless character, contributing his acting trademark -- visceral intensity -- to his first Shakespeare attempt.</p>
        <p>''This role is kind of like being shot out of a cannon and you have to get to that level right off the bat. And then allow it to get even more intense as the play goes on,'' he said. ''It's high emotion and it takes a lot of training.''</p>
        <p>For Bonnie Monte, artistic director for the N.J.S.F., a five-year search has ended. ''Mark Antonys are hard to find, so it took a while. With Bob and Tamara (Tunie), I feel like I've got the perfect Antony and Cleopatra,'' she said. ''Not only is Bob physically right for the role, but he's incredibly facile with the language. He hears the music of the text, which is a testament to his intellect, as well as his training as a singer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuccioli is best known for his performances in local and Broadway musicals, in particular, his 20-month run in Broadway's ''Jekyll &amp; Hyde,'' which earned him Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle awards and a 1997 Tony Award nomination. It also created die-hard fans. On opening night, ''Jekkies,'' sporting ''Jekyll and Hyde'' T-shirts, peppered the F. M. Kirby Shakespeare Theatre.</p>
        <p>To this day, Frank Wildhorn, the musical's creator, considers Mr. Cuccioli's audition one of the most memorable in his career. ''He was so intense. He almost threw a chair out of the window and he was ripping off his clothes. There was no question who would play that role after that,'' he said. ''So much of the magic of 'Jekyll and Hyde,' and its success, goes back to the original magic of Bob and Linda [Eder] onstage. It's a real tribute to Bob.''</p>
        <p>Since leaving the musical, Mr. Cuccioli said he had been trying to break the molds and stereotypes that had confined and followed him. ''I've been kicking around for a good 18 years in this business, but that was the thing that threw me into the limelight because it's a controversial piece and it was a new musical. I owe a lot to that show,'' he said. ''But I'm at the time of my life now and my career that I'm trying to push the envelopes and see what the range is in everything that I want to do, and everything that I can do.''</p>
        <p>Though the 42-year-old Manhasset, Long Island, native has an impressive acting resume -- from his Broadway debut as Inspector Javert in ''Les Miserables'' in 1993, to television and film work -- his first career was in finance. After graduating from St. John's University, he worked for E. F. Hutton for three years, and had planned to become a corporate lawyer. While working on Wall Street, he began doing regional theater and studying voice in his spare time, and decided to pursue his acting dream full time.</p>
        <p>''I always did musicals in high school and college and sang in glee clubs and I had a band, but I never thought of doing this as a career. I never dreamed it even was a career,'' he said. ''But I'm glad I have a business background, so I understand my own finances and the finances of a show. That's a problem that I find with many performers -- they're so geared to the art that they miss the business.''</p>
        <p>Leaving behind a comfortable desk job for the rigorous training ground of the Light Opera of Manhattan, Mr. Cuccioli worked four part-time jobs to supplement his meager $35-per-week salary.</p>
        <p>He also had to cope with his parents' reaction. ''I had support from my friends and my three sisters, but not my parents. I forgive them,'' he said. ''I guess they were afraid I'd be not working and always starving. Unfortunately, they didn't get to see a lot of the glory. They saw much of the pain.'' His parents died 12 years ago, just after he got his first big break as Lancelot in a national tour of ''Camelot'' with Richard Harris.</p>
        <p>''He's a real success story in my eyes. He received no special treatment. He did this all on his own,'' said Patrice Mulvey, one of his sisters. ''He's a very sensitive and giving person and he hasn't been changed by this business. He hasn't forgotten who he is. You won't find him in a nightclub looking for recognition. He's a very private person.''</p>
        <p>The Manhattan resident's most recent musical credits include ''Pajama Game'' in Pittsburgh, The Sacramento Light Opera's production of ''The Secret Garden'' and ''Enter the Guardsman'' last year at N.J.S.F. Last spring he developed and performed his own cabaret show,  ''Hero,'' at Arci's Place in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>David Wasson, who performed with Mr. Cuccioli in a production of ''The Rothschilds,'' directed his cabaret show. ''I never saw Bob cheat an audience. I never saw him coast,'' he said. ''Look at his following. These people will see him time and time again without ever being disappointed.''</p>
        <p>In November, Mr. Cuccioli will perform in ''Victor/Victoria'' at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn -- a stage he considers a ''home base,'' having performed there in several productions over the years. The busy actor also plans to record a pop-rock album in the near future. ''He has such a great instrument it's like teaching a horse how to run,'' Katie Agresta, his vocal coach for the last four years, said of his voice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuccioli hopes to do more film work. If Ms. Monte and Mr. Wildhorn prevail, he will also perform more Shakespeare, possibly ''Macbeth,'' and debut another Broadway show.</p>
        <p>''I think he's one of the best-kept secrets on Broadway,'' Mr. Wasson said. ''And he hasn't even hit his peak yet.''</p>
