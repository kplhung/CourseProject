        <p>THE singer-songwriter Kevin Briody always considered himself a writer rather than a performer.</p>
        <p>That all changed two years ago when he played an open-mike show at the Towne Crier Cafe in Pawling, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''It was an eye opener,'' said Mr. Briody from his Ridgefield home last week. ''I'd been writing for 10 years and was happy. Now I enjoy performing.''</p>
        <p>Good thing. Mr. Briody, who last night performed in a folk festival at the Eli Whitney Barn in Hamden, has a busy month.</p>
        <p>Tonight he will perform in Pawling, N.Y., at the Towne Crier Cafe's showcase evening. His fellow singer-songwriters Jen Shankman and Ann Heaton will share the 8 p.m. bill. He will then perform on Thursday in Manchester, on Saturday in Litchfield and on Sept. 30 at the St. James Potato Festival in Stratford.</p>
        <p>Nine months ago, Mr. Briody came out with his debut CD, titled ''When No One's Watching,'' giving him another reason to hit the road. The CD, a 10-song collection of originals, mostly produced by Mr. Briody himself, serves not only as a handy calling card, but also as a token of a live performance.</p>
        <p>Like most undiscovered musicians, Mr. Briody sells most of his recordings out of his trunk following his shows.</p>
        <p>Like performing, recording was an afterthought for Mr. Briody. Another musician suggested he produce one. Mr. Briody knew it was a good business decision. But he doubted he could support recording by touring if it ever took off.</p>
        <p>''The fact is that my wife and I have a young family,'' said Mr. Briody, the father of three children. ''I don't want to travel all over the place.''</p>
        <p>So far Mr. Briody has logged plenty of miles to build his career. He has  been to such showcases as the Blue Bird in Nashville and the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas. It was during this time that Mr. Briody realized he would have to perform his original songs if he hoped to sell them to established singers. Performing, he said, also informs his songwriting. ''I learned that people like fast songs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Briody comes from musical stock (his father was a trombone player in a couple of traditional New Orleans jazz bands). Young Mr. Briody traveled through Ridgefield High School in 1981, Colgate University in 1985, and worked as a insurance salesman for Prudential in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''I thought about what I wanted to do,'' Mr. Briody said. ''I took off for the Middle East to sort out my priorities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Briody spent two years abroad, first living on a kibbutz, then working on an archeological dig. The fresh air cleared his head, allowing the notion of songwriting to take root. ''I'd done some writing in college, and I thought it was worth exploring,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Soon after returning to Ridgefield, Mr. Briody enrolled at the New School in Manhattan, where he studied songwriting with the country songwriter Hugh Prestwood. Mr. Briody followed Mr. Prestwood's lead, flavoring his songs with country arrangements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Briody's songs are concerned with storytelling rather than pick-up trucks and tidy resolutions.</p>
        <p>His lost-love song, ''Four Dollar Frame,'' and his ode to his father, ''At the End of the Day,'' for instance, show his personalized touch.</p>
        <p>The Towne Crier figures significantly in Mr. Briody's performing career. After playing several open-mike shows, he has returned to Pawling many times for either its showcases or as an opening act for national acts. One of these days, Mr. Briody hopes, someone important in the industry will catch his show and buy his songs.</p>
        <p>''As much as I've enjoyed performing and will continue to do it, my goal is to have other people perform them,'' said Mr. Briody. ''Who'd ever thought that I'd be an entertainer?''</p>
        <p>Kevin Briody will perform tonight at 8 p.m. at the Towne Crier Cafe (Route 22, Pawling, N.Y.; 845-855-1300), on Thursday at the Silk Room, Cheney Hall (Manchester; 860-647-9824), on Saturday at 9 p.m. at The County Seat (Litchfield; 860-567-8069) and at 1 p.m. on Sept. 30 at the St. James Potato Festival in Stratford (rain or shine).</p>
