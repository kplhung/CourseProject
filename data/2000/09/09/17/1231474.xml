It was to have marked the end of 52 years of bitter conflict and the achievement of a permanent treaty. But the conflict continued and so did the peace talks, in as much of a stalemate as ever. Originally the Palestinians had pledged to make a unilateral declaration of statehood if there was to be no agreement. But, bowing to international pressure, they quietly retreated and vowed to give negotiations a couple more months.</p>
