        <p>When the Ottoman sultan, Abdul Hamit II, opened the first subway here 125 years ago, some of his devoutly religious subjects refused to use it because they feared going underground before they died.</p>
        <p>Today, with the inauguration of the city's first new subway since then, the anxieties were rooted in a mixture of fear, faith and fate.</p>
        <p>Little more than a year ago, the region was rocked by a devastating earthquake that killed at least 17,000 people. Smaller quakes have occurred with regularity since, and the city's apartment buildings often empty at the slightest tremor.</p>
        <p>''If you are up above ground or down below, the earthquake will get you anyway if it's your time,'' said Osman Canturk, 40, as he watched today's festivities with his three children. ''If you are a person with faith, you are not afraid. So I'll be happy to go on this subway.''</p>
        <p>Most of the thousands of people who turned out for an afternoon of entertainment and speeches seemed  enthusiastic about a chance to ride the shiny new subway, with its French-built cars and mosaic-lined  entrances.</p>
        <p>Mayor Ali Mufit Gurtuna, who was joined in the grandstand with officials from Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan and France, praised the system as the most modern in the world.</p>
        <p>The new subway is certainly a far cry from the old tunnel, which used horse-drawn wagons to haul people 600 yards up a hill from the Golden Horn to the Beyoglu district. The horses were replaced with electricity long ago, and the subway cars in that tunnel still carry about four million passengers a year.</p>
        <p>Henry Gavan, a French engineer, got the idea for the original subway after he got tired of walking up the hill. It took him three years to persuade the sultan to let him begin the tunnel and another three years to finish work. At the time, only London and New York City had subways.</p>
        <p>When the tunnel first opened, the local imam, or religious leader, cautioned people to avoid going underground, saying it was inappropriate for good Muslims. But the imam  relented and blessed the subway.</p>
        <p>Religion was absent from the ceremonies marking the opening of the new subway, a reflection of the secular nature of today's Turkey. The new version was conceived as part of a master plan to relieve traffic congestion, which has become as crushing as midtown Manhattan as Istanbul has grown to a city of 12 million.</p>
        <p>The first phase of the new subway is nearly five miles long and it connects two of the city's busiest districts. The line begins in bustling Taksim Square, a major hub for commuter buses arriving in the city, and ends in Levent, a residential neighborhood.</p>
        <p>This initial phase took eight years to complete and cost $631 million, about 20 percent higher than budgeted. Authorities with the municipal technical affairs directorate said part of the added cost was for upgrading protection in case of an earthquake. They said the line was built to resist earthquakes as high as magnitude 9.</p>
        <p>The ride is swift and smooth, covering the four stops that are open so far in 12 minutes. A one-way ticket costs about 45 cents, and eventually the subway will have the capacity for 70,000 passengers an hour.</p>
        <p>The system will operate 24 hours a day and security will be tight, with 200 plainclothes officers on duty.</p>
        <p>The next phase, scheduled for completion in two years, will go in the opposite direction, beneath the Golden Horn to link Taksim Square with Yenikapi. The second line has raised concerns because it will burrow beneath the peninsula that is home to the city's most historic monuments, including Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sofia.</p>
        <p>''Maximum care must be taken to preserve underground treasures of this city,'' said Bulent Tuna of the Istanbul Chamber of Architects.</p>
        <p>Work also began in February to link Taksim Square with the new Ataturk airport on the city outskirts.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 30, 2000, Saturday  An article on Sept. 17 about the opening of a subway system in Istanbul referred imprecisely to the relative ages of the city's original one, in 1875, and New York's. The New York subway opened in 1904, although the Long Island Rail Road had a limited underground line operating in the mid-19th century.</p>
