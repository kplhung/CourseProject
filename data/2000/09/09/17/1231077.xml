        <p>The Great Lakes Aquarium, which says it is the first aquarium in the United States with all freshwater tanks, recently opened on the shore of Lake Superior in Duluth, Minn. It examines the geology and plant and animal life of the lake, as well as the effects climate and humans have had on it. The aquarium contains 70 species of fish along with otters, frogs and turtles.</p>
        <p>A 12-foot-long model of the Great Lakes allows visitors to float toy boats from Lake Superior to the St. Lawrence Seaway via the lakes' system of locks. Visitors can also use a camera to look at tiny living organisms native to the lake's sandy, rocky bottom and project images of them onto a TV screen.</p>
