        <p>His jaw is held in place by two steel plates. He is on medication for chronic back pain. But two years after he was severely beaten on a Queens street in what the authorities called a bias crime, Rishi Maharaj, now 22, does not like to complain. ''It could have been so much worse,'' he said in an interview on Friday. ''How can I complain about the little ailments?''</p>
        <p>He is relieved, he says, that one of the defendants, Nuno Martins, 21, has been convicted of assault and sentenced to eight years in prison. The other two, Luis Amorim, 24, and Peter DiMarco, 21, were acquitted.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors had said that the three men set upon Mr. Maharaj one night as he walked with two female cousins along the street past Mr. Martins's house in South Ozone Park. They sought to attack an Indian, the prosecution maintained.</p>
        <p>In truth, Mr. Maharaj was born in this country to Trinidadian immigrants whose descendants came from India in the 19th century. Still, he took a beating so severe that he landed in the hospital with blunt-trauma injuries to the head, numerous facial fractures and a broken jaw.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maharaj's beating became a centerpiece in the state campaign for penalties for hate crimes. He became the subject of songs and books. His name was spoken at rallies, cultural assemblies and temple gatherings in the South Asian community. Today, while he is grateful for the support and activism of South Asians in the city, he remains critical of what he sees as their sudden and self-interested surge of concern in hate crimes.</p>
        <p>''One cannot wait for it to happen to someone in one's own community,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maharaj, who has just been hired as a news assistant at a local radio station, has begun to speak out. Last month, he addressed a crowd at an anti-hate-crimes rally on the steps of City Hall with Hillary Rodham Clinton. Last week, he appeared on a radio program on WBAI.</p>
        <p>''Instead of having people speak for me, I'm an individual again,'' he said. ''I'm not just a case. I feel like I have my name back.''</p>
