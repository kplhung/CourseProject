        <p>I REALLY don't know what I would do without butterflies,'' Harry Zirlin, a Manhattan lawyer, said on a recent sunny Saturday. ''They've taken me everywhere: Arizona, Utah, Oregon. . . .''</p>
        <p>He might have added Inwood Hill Park,  Floyd Bennett Field and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden or Sailors' Snug Harbor, one of the spots on Staten Island he was heading to that day. For the last 25 years or so, Mr. Zirlin and a friend, Jeff Ingraham, a cabinetmaker from Brooklyn, have successfully stalked their quarry in all five boroughs, mostly as members of the New York City Butterfly Club.</p>
        <p>The two men insist that the name of their group, which was founded in 1983 and now has about 70 members, is not a contradiction in terms. They say that if you know where and when to look, you can see more than 100 butterfly species in the city. That's more than in most rural areas upstate and nearly twice as many as in all of Britain.</p>
        <p>''The most hard-core urbanite is a red admiral,'' Mr. Ingraham said. ''They have no qualms about heading right down the canyons of Manhattan. I once saw one downtown sitting on a red Cadillac.''</p>
        <p>New York owes its surprising wealth of butterflies largely to geography. The city is on the southern edge of the range of many Northern butterflies and at the northern limit of many butterflies from the South. It also lies on the coast, which is used by many species as a flyway, or migratory path.</p>
        <p>Certain butterflies regularly use the coastal flyway to journey north as their populations swell farther south, arriving here in late summer or fall and stopping at green places like the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in Queens and Conference House Park at the southern tip of Staten Island. These Southern species -- among them sachems, cloudless sulphurs, ocola skippers, snouts, buckeyes, hackberry emperors, tawny emperors and variegated fritillaries -- are eagerly sought by urban butterfliers right into October.</p>
        <p>''I love butterflies and I love baseball,'' Mr. Ingraham said, ''and they have almost exactly the same seasons.''</p>
        <p>The New York City Butterfly Club began as a general nature-study group, said its president, Guy Tudor, who attributes his office to the fact that the club has always held its monthly meetings in his apartment in Forest Hills, Queens.</p>
        <p>Only one member is a professional lepidopterist. ''We have an investment banker, an upholsterer and a couple of firemen,'' said Mr. Tudor, a bird illustrator who won a MacArthur award in 1990. Many members, he added, are bird-watchers who have moved on to butterflies.</p>
        <p>But few members wield a net; instead, they carry cameras and close-focusing binoculars. In the mid-80's, the club adopted a resolution limiting collection by its members, and it urges anyone engaged in nature study ''not to depredate'' butterflies.</p>
        <p>This hands-off approach was popularized nationally by the North American Butterfly Association, or NABA, a conservation group founded in 1993 by Jeffrey Glassberg, the author of the popular ''Butterflies Through Binoculars'' series (Oxford University Press). But Mr. Glassberg is still the vice president of the New York City Butterfly Club -- it and the local NABA chapter are probably the city's two most active butterfly groups -- and the method and the ideas behind the approach were developed by the Butterfly Club, Mr. Tudor said.</p>
        <p>True, some members were once collectors or collect even now in certain circumstances, including Mr. Ingraham and Mr. Zirlin. As a result, they are teased by other members as ''slaughterers.''</p>
        <p>''Wait, we're reformed slaughterers,'' Mr. Ingraham pleaded, and Mr. Zirlin added: ''In the city, you just don't do it. For one thing, it's illegal in all the parks, and people really get upset. Scientifically, there's just no point. We know exactly what's here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zirlin and Mr. Ingraham -- without their nets -- went to Staten Island recently to look for any arriving Southern strays and in particular three butterflies that can be hard to find in New York City: the hackberry emperor, the tawny emperor and the snout butterfly, all of whose caterpillars feed on hackberry bushes. ''If you see all of those on one trip, you've had a great day of butterflying,'' Mr. Zirlin said.</p>
        <p>The main destination was Conference House Park, which has the city's biggest concentration of hackberries, with a stop at the Staten Island Botanical Garden at Sailors' Snug Harbor, where a manicured patch of Buddleia and Joe Pye weed right by the parking lot is a magnet for Southern strays. Mr. Zirlin and Mr. Ingraham share an impressive ability to spot butterflies where none seem at first to be, and they gleefully took roll at Snug Harbor:</p>
        <p>''Silver-spotted skipper! Broadwing skipper! Red-banded hairstreak!'' This last was a perky metallic gray thing with an eye spot and threadlike tails that looked like antennae, a trick to make birds attack the wrong end. ''That's a good one,'' Mr. Ingraham said. ''We're not seeing any showboats, but this is good stuff.''</p>
        <p>Butterfliers appreciate beauty but are more interested in the rare or unusual. Two conspicuously beautiful butterflies, a tiger swallowtail and a monarch, sailed overhead, ignored by Mr. Zirlin and Mr. Ingraham, while they squealed over a drab brown dervish of a bug -- their idea of a showboat. ''Ocola skipper! That's as good as you can ask for,'' Mr. Ingraham said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Zirlin focused his camera inches away from a white butterfly. ''Butterflies are very aware of movement,'' he said. ''If you go slowly, you can get right up on them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zirlin and Mr. Ingraham said that there were suspicions that someone on Staten Island was releasing European butterflies, and that this might well be one, the European large white, which had never been reported in the wild in North America. ''Somebody would have to be really irresponsible to turn that loose,'' Mr. Zirlin said, heading for the car.</p>
        <p>At Conference House Park, Mr. Zirlin  disappeared into a thicket. As Mr. Ingraham pointed out the spicebush swallowtails gliding under the trees, whoops echoed in the distance. ''Hey, come on! You won't believe this. This is a real hot spot.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ingraham found Mr. Zirlin in a sunny clearing, where the air was abuzz with darting butterflies. ''Look, he's on me,'' Mr. Zirlin said of a hackberry emperor. ''They like to sit on people to drink their sweat.''</p>
        <p>Among the hackberries flew some odd-looking snout butterflies, with elongated mouth parts that really do look like a snout. They watched as one laid a single pearly pinhead-size egg. ''I've never seen this many snouts before,'' Mr. Zirlin said. ''Well, I have, but in Texas or Arizona.''</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Mr. Ingraham shouted, ''White M! White M!'' It was another hairstreak, this one marked with the thin white zigzag that gives it its name. 'He's nice and fresh. That's the prize of the day. I've seen half a dozen in 24 years of looking in New York City.''</p>
        <p>Moments later, though, peering into the Japanese knotweed nearer the beach, he found two more and then another, for an amazing total of four. ''White M's are rare anywhere,'' Mr. Ingraham said, ''but as far as I know, all the sightings in New York have been singletons -- never more than one. I really can't believe this.''</p>
        <p>The day wasn't officially over until Mr. Ingraham, beyond tallying the 25 species they had seen in a brief visit to just two tiny patches of park, checked to see where their finds would rank among city records: ''Earliest sighting of an ocola skipper; first multiple sighting of white M hairstreaks; first North American sighting of a European large white. How's that for New York City butterflying? I love this place.''</p>
