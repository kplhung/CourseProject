      <abstract>
        <p>Democrats think Jim Matheson has good shot at defeating Republican Derek Smith for House seat from Utah after divisive Republican primary; Matheson, son of popular former governor, plays down party affiliation; has big lead in latest poll (M)</p>

        <p>Few states are more Republican than Utah, where the party controls the governor's office, both houses of the state legislature and all five of the state's seats in the United States Senate and House. But Democrats think they have a good shot this year at capturing the state's Second Congressional District, which covers Salt Lake City.</p>
        <p>The district is predominantly Republican, but not as predominantly Republican as the two other Congressional districts. Further, Republicans in the district are still trying to pull themselves together after going through a divisive primary campaign that saw Derek Smith, an Internet businessman and political neophyte, take the nomination away from the two-term incumbent, Merrill Cook. Mr. Cook had a rocky history of antagonizing legislative colleagues, members of his staff and top party officials in Utah.</p>

        <p>The district is predominantly Republican, but not as predominantly Republican as the two other Congressional districts. Further, Republicans in the district are still trying to pull themselves together after going through a divisive primary campaign that saw Derek Smith, an Internet businessman and political neophyte, take the nomination away from the two-term incumbent, Merrill Cook. Mr. Cook had a rocky history of antagonizing legislative colleagues, members of his staff and top party officials in Utah.</p>
        <p>Finally -- and most important, say political pros -- the Democratic candidate is Jim Matheson, son of an immensely popular former governor, Scott M. Matheson.</p>
        <p>But there's a catch.</p>
        <p>Jim Matheson is not running as a Democrat. He will show up as one on the ballot in November. But out on the campaign trail and in his television ads, there is no evidence of what party he calls home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith contends Mr. Matheson is ''hiding'' and has squishy political principles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Matheson counters that everybody in the state already knows all Mathesons are Democrats. And anyway, he argues, nonpartisan politics is ''the better way.''</p>
        <p>For what it's worth, the latest Salt Lake Tribune poll has Mr. Matheson beating Mr. Smith two to one.</p>
