        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was sorry to see Karim Butler's letter, ''The Best Are Black'' [Aug. 27], suggesting that blues music produced by someone who doesn't come from the African-American culture is inherently inferior to that produced by African-Americans. Mr. Butler also claims that ''the best and most original klezmer music tends to come from Eastern European Jews.'' This statement would be disputed by most Jewish listeners, including me, who have heard the remarkable African-American klezmer clarinetist Don Byron. I prefer to remain culture-blind when listening to music of any style. As Duke Ellington said (and Peter Schickele often quotes), ''If it sounds good, it is good.''</p>
