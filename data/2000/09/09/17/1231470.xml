        <p>Russia's atomic energy minister, Yevgeny Adamov, says he has absolute confidence that the giant twin reactors sealed inside the Kursk pose no radiation risk to the fishing grounds of the Barents Sea. But a day after Mr. Adamov suggested that leaving the nuclear submarine where it sank on Aug. 12 might be safer than raising it, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov declared that Russia still intends to raise the Kursk. Mr. Klebanov said that he, too, believed in the safety of the shutdown reactors, but acknowledged that the public, and Russia's neighbors in Norway, would feel better if the sub were raised. The salvage work will follow attempts to recover the remains of the 118 who died in the sub, and might not begin until the spring.</p>
