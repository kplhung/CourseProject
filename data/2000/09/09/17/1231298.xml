        <p>John A. Fratta has been the district manager for Community Board 11 in the northern Bronx for five years, and each year when he helps put together the budget request, one item tops his list: more police.</p>
        <p>The 49th Precinct, which includes  Morris Park, Pelham Parkway, Allerton and Van Nest, all in his district, is dangerously understaffed, he said, and for years neighborhood residents have organized civic patrols.</p>
        <p>''If we didn't have civilian patrols, we'd have a totally out of control situation,'' said Mr. Fratta, noting that there are four citizen patrols staffed by about 200 volunteers in his district. ''It's ridiculous. We're handling our own crime up here. And I am always getting complaints in my office that people will call the precinct five times and get no officers responding.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fratta said 138 police officers are stationed in the 49th Precinct, which he said was the smallest number of officers assigned to any precinct in the borough. Assemblyman Jeffrey Klein, who represents the 80th Assembly District in the northeastern and northwestern Bronx, said his office conducted a study three years ago and found that there were 45 fewer police officers in the 49th Precinct than the target numbers set by the Police Department.</p>
        <p>Charles Larkin, a police spokesman, said that to protect public safety, the department does not give out personnel information about any precincts.</p>
        <p>But Lt. Stephen Biegel, another police spokesman, said, ''Crime is down in the 49th precinct by 2 percent this year, and down over 50 percent over seven years.''</p>
        <p>According to department statistics, however, certain crimes are up.  Murders increased to 10 from 4 last year, and grand larcenies were up to 279 from 209 last year.</p>
        <p>In any case, whatever the statistics, Mr. Klein contends that the quality of life in the neighborhoods of  the 49th has significantly declined in recent years.</p>
        <p>''We're seeing a lot of car thefts, much more graffiti, and a lot of pushing crimes against senior citizens,'' he said. ''Neighborhood tenants are very, very concerned about burglaries, and kids hanging out at all hours of the night.</p>
        <p>''The Police Department over the last couple of years has been very fond of citing police stats at us,'' he added. ''But some of these things can't be measured by statistics.</p>
        <p>''My constituents see a decline, they see it getting worse. My constituents feel safer if they see cops on the beat, and they don't see that police presence.''</p>
