        <p>THE business of using biotechnology to make hardier, more bounteous crops has long been a graveyard for small, undernourished companies.</p>
        <p>Large companies have been pulling in the reins lately, too. Monsanto, a pioneer in the agricultural biotechnology business, is being spun off from Pharmacia, the drug company that acquired it earlier this year, but which analysts say wants to focus more on its pharmaceuticals business. Novartis and AstraZeneca, meanwhile, two European companies with sizable undertakings in agricultural biotechnology, are merging their agrochemical operations and spinning them off.</p>
        <p>So why is Eden Bioscience, a plant biotechnology company in Bothell, Wash., bothering to go public?</p>
        <p>Eden, which is planning an initial public offering on Nasdaq as early as this week, hopes to sell about one-quarter of its equity, or 5.8 million shares, at $12 to $14 each. So far, the company has just one product on the market, a pesticide alternative with the trade name Messenger, which relies on proteins that occur naturally in the environment and which Eden said in its prospectus was the first product of its kind.</p>
        <p>Messenger appears to set into motion a plant's natural defenses against pests and disease. In field trials on more than 40 crops, Messenger not only reduced or eliminated the need for traditional chemical pesticides but also improved crop yields by 10 to 20 percent, without leaving harmful residues in the environment, according to its prospectus.</p>
        <p>Industry analysts say Eden crossed an important hurdle last April, when the Environmental Protection Agency gave it approval to sell Messenger on the condition that the company conduct four other studies by April 2001 to further demonstrate the product's safety. In August, Eden began selling Messenger to farmers in Florida.</p>
        <p>Eden still has a long road ahead. For one, the company generated just $115,000 in revenue, all from consulting, in 1999. And the biotechnology industry has also seen its share of one-product companies that have tried to market their discoveries without the support of sizable, well-heeled partners. According to its prospectus, Eden is still looking for some big partners to team up with.</p>
        <p>Production has been another problem. According to the prospectus, Eden still has to show that it can make large-enough quantities of Messenger without compromising product quality. The company wants to use up to $20 million of the proceeds from its offering to expand its manufacturing facilities, a process that could take up to two years.</p>
        <p>STILL, the prospects for a company like Eden Bioscience aren't as dour as they might have been just a few years ago, analysts say. G. Steven Burrill, the founder of Burrill &amp; Company, a private merchant bank in San Francisco, said that the venture capital fund his company started in 1998 for agriculture and agricultural biotechnology companies had done well, raising about $85 million and generating a 300 percent return on the 13 companies in which it has invested. ''There are a lot of interesting investment opportunities in this area,'' Mr. Burrill said.</p>
        <p>Consumer and environmental groups have raised protests about genetically modified foods, but some agricultural biotechnology companies have done well in finding investors who recognize technologies, like Messenger's, that do not modify a plant's genetic material, he said. He added that Paradigm Genetics, a biotechnology concern in Research Triangle Park, N.C., is another business that is not modifying genetic material but is aiming at the crop production market, though as part of a larger business strategy. Paradigm's stock, which Mr. Burrill's company helped to take public, has risen from an initial public offering price of $7 in May to $19.38 at the close on Friday.</p>
        <p>Robert Gardiner, manager of the Wasatch Micro Cap fund, thinks that Eden may well succeed. ''This company's products appear to not only increase crop yield, without being cost-prohibitive, but also seem to have broad applications without hurting the environment,'' he said.</p>
