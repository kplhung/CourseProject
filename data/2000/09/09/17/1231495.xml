        <p>New Mexico has been a reliable national bellwether in presidential politics. In every presidential race except one since it became a state in 1912, New Mexico has supported the winner, often close to the margin as the nation as a whole. The lone exception came in 1976 when the state backed  Gerald R. Ford.</p>
        <p>This may help explain why both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush already have both visited this state with only five  electoral votes -- and likely will come again before Election Day.</p>

        <p>New Mexico has been a reliable national bellwether in presidential politics. In every presidential race except one since it became a state in 1912, New Mexico has supported the winner, often close to the margin as the nation as a whole. The lone exception came in 1976 when the state backed  Gerald R. Ford.</p>
        <p>This may help explain why both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush already have both visited this state with only five  electoral votes -- and likely will come again before Election Day.</p>
        <p>This weekend, The Albuquerque Journal is scheduled to release a poll that declares the race a statistical tie. The poll of 553 likely and registered voters gave Mr. Bush 43 percent and Mr. Gore 42 percent, with 11 percent remaining undecided. The poll, conducted by Research and  Polling Inc., was taken from Sept. 7-13. Neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Gore  has an apparent reason for claiming momentum; a March poll found the two candidates tied.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has courted Hispanic voters aggressively, and New Mexico would seem fertile ground for this appeal, since Hispanic residents make up about 41 percent of the state's population. But The Journal poll shows Mr. Gore with a lead among Hispanics, 57 percent to 25 percent.</p>
        <p>''The Hispanic vote is critical for any Democratic presidential candidate to win here, and by a good margin, too,'' said F. Chris Garcia, a University of New Mexico political science professor, who noted that a strong Hispanic showing carried Mr.  Clinton to victory in 1992 and 1996.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia cited issues such as health care, education and Social Security as those important to voters but noted that no single issue seemingly stands out. There are about 918,000 registered voters (out of a state population of 1.7 million), with about 54 percent as Democrats, 33 percent as Republicans and the rest affiliated with other parties. Still, Mr. Garcia said the state was slowly becoming more conservative.</p>
