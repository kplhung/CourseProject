        <p>LIKE a modern-day conquistador, Roger Norman surveys a vast expanse of open brush and sage, and dreams of El Dorado.</p>
        <p>He has plans to turn his 104,000 empty acres here into the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, the largest industrial park in North America, with 120 million square feet of industrial and warehouse space, power plants, movie studios and even a racetrack. He is sure that he could fill it with new-economy tenants, as he has done at South Meadows, a smaller project closer to Reno that is near completion.</p>
        <p>Only one ingredient is missing, he said: a sky filled with planes heading toward Reno's modern airport.</p>
        <p>''You can't build things fast enough here,'' said Mr. Norman, 37. ''But without the air traffic, how do we accommodate the growth that wants to come here?''</p>
        <p>Before November 1998, there were plenty of flights to Reno, most of them flown by Reno Air, an independent carrier that had grown to serve a large chunk of the West. Then AMR, the parent of American Airlines, acquired Reno Air for $124 million and began reducing service. Despite complaints from business and political leaders, the number of nonstop flights on all airlines to Reno -- 127 daily from 28 cities in 1997 -- has fallen to just 88 daily from 12 cities today.</p>
        <p>The reasons lie in the economics of the hub-and-spoke route systems operated by American and other large carriers, according to Dale Morris, a spokesman for the airline. Most passengers are routed through a few high-volume hub airports, like American's at Dallas-Fort Worth, where they catch connecting flights to their final destinations. Away from the hubs, only the most popular routes have nonstop service, and according to Mr. Morris, ''secondary markets'' like Reno ''don't have the lift'' to warrant many direct flights.</p>
        <p>Reno is a conservatively minded, pro-business city, and people here acknowledge the capitalist logic of American's stance. But they had grown used to the broader service that their hometown airline had provided, and its disappearance leaves them fearing for Reno's long-term ability to compete with other cities in the region, most notably Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Developers like Mr. Norman worry that demand for ambitious projects already in the pipeline will be undercut if prospective tenants find it a nuisance to get in and out of town by air. Gambling-industry executives worry that making Reno less accessible will further widen the gap between Reno's casinos and those in Las Vegas, and perhaps make Reno more vulnerable to competition from new Indian-owned casinos springing up in California.</p>
        <p>SUCH concerns are increasingly commonplace in ''second-tier'' cities, said John Kasarda, president of the Kenan Institute for Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina. The hub-and-spoke air traffic system leaves even rapidly growing cities like Reno feeling marginalized.</p>
        <p>It's not just a matter of tourism. For a city that wants to keep growing, being an easily accessible air hub -- what Professor Kasarda calls an ''aerotropolis'' -- is crucial to attracting high-technology and Internet businesses and investment, he said.</p>
        <p>Electronic commerce companies in particular, with their emphasis on speed as a competitive advantage, have come to understand that warehousing and handling goods in places where they can be rapidly and efficiently distributed is just as vital to their success as having plenty of bandwidth and server capacity: more than 70 percent of e-commerce sales are shipped through express delivery services, he said.</p>
        <p>Businesspeople in the technology sector travel more than their counterparts in the traditional economy,  Professor Kasarda said -- in some studies, up to four times as often.</p>
        <p>So it is not surprising that even cities with everything else going for them -- from land to tax rates to infrastructure -- can find their growth threatened by a lack of direct air service. Metropolitan areas like Tulsa, Okla., and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., have wrestled with perceived air-service shortfalls in recent years, and have galvanized political and business leaders to find solutions.</p>
        <p>Frustrations over the paucity of flights to Wisconsin in the early 1980's even prompted Kimberly-Clark, the paper products giant then with headquarters near Milwaukee, to lease a jet and begin running its own airline. The service was opened to the public in 1984 as Midwest Express, and has since been spun off as a separate company.</p>
        <p>WHAT the Renos, Tulsas and Raleighs care most about are nonstop flights to major business centers like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>
        <p>''Many midsized cities have become preoccupied about this,'' Professor Kasarda said. ''They see it as key to their economic development. Businesspeople hate to change planes and listen to the music at O'Hare. Time is money for these people.''</p>
        <p>In Reno, business and political leaders are casting about for ways to entice other airlines to expand service to Reno and replace the flights that American has trimmed. American, Southwest Airlines and other carriers have been visited by officials here, but so far the lobbying has not yielded any changes.</p>
        <p>State Senator Randolph Townsend, who represents the city and is the chairman of the Legislature's commerce and labor committee, said the state is considering incentives ranging from state contracts to reductions in fuel taxes and landing fees to obliging airlines, including start-up regional carriers like Allegiant Air, based in Fresno, Calif.</p>
        <p>Never mind that such proposals run counter to the free-market ideology that dominates politics here; loss of direct air service could ''really hurt in the long run,'' Mr. Townsend said, even though job and income-growth statistics in the Reno area have yet to show definite signs of weakening.</p>
        <p>But a harbinger of losses may be visible in the recent decision by Reno's largest manufacturer, International Game Technology, to keep its 300-person sales and marketing operation in Las Vegas, where executives and technicians have access to a much wider array of flights to places around the country and, increasingly, the world.</p>
        <p>The president of the company, Tom Butler, said that operating from Reno with its current level of air service meant adding up to two extra days to every trip to the East Coast or overseas.</p>
        <p>''If we were to locate today,'' he said, ''we'd put everything in Las Vegas.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Butler became head of the company, whose plant is in Mr. Norman's South Meadows industrial park, in 1996, before American acquired Reno Air.</p>
        <p>Now, he said, ''it bugs customers when we have to bring them here, and it takes away one of the things that would help bring sophisticated employees here.''</p>
        <p>Smaller businesses smart at the loss of service, too. Addi Gallery has exhibition space in Reno, Maui and most recently Las Vegas; it also has a new Internet-based art business called GalleryRow.com. Winifred Addi, the company's chief operating officer, said that the loss of Reno Air's direct service to Orange County, Calif., and San Diego kept potential customers away from her Reno location, and that cutbacks in flights to San Jose had hampered development of the Web site part of the business.</p>
        <p>''We had a meeting with 25 top representatives of Bay Area and Orange County tech companies, and people just didn't want to wait around,'' she said. ''They were all worrying about how to catch a flight to get themselves home. If the meeting had been in a place like L.A., we could have started earlier and gone into the evening. It really hurts.''</p>
        <p>The biggest potential losers are the casinos, which remain the bulwark of the region's economy. Glen Carano, marketing director for the Silver Legacy Casino in downtown Reno, said the loss of convenient service to Orange County, San Diego and other markets threatened to depress an important category of business -- bookings for large conventions.</p>
        <p>''It's a challenge when it's tough to get here, and I am going to have a hard time getting them to come,'' Mr. Carano said. ''We sit here and think we are at the center of the world, but you've got travel planners with thousands of markets and hundreds of airports to look at. We are just a little pimple to them.''</p>
        <p>GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS  Correction:  September 24, 2000, Sunday  The Grass-Roots Business column last Sunday, about the economic effects of reduced air service to Reno, Nev., misstated the surname of the chief executive of International Game Technology, a company based there, who worried that the cutbacks made the city less competitive. He is Tom Baker, not Butler.</p>
