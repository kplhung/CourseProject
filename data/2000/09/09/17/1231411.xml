        <p>Marcel Fischer had just lost his chance to advance to the gold-medal match, and reacted as if he were Charles Oakley faced with the flop-to-the-floor acting skills of Reggie Miller. The 22-year-old Swiss epeeist with the platinum blond hair jawed at his victorious opponent, the Frenchman Hugues Obry, then fulminated for an hour in three tongues.</p>
        <p>''He's falling down like a dead man,'' Fischer said. ''I just asked him if he thinks this is fair play because he knows it's not correct.''</p>

        <p>Marcel Fischer had just lost his chance to advance to the gold-medal match, and reacted as if he were Charles Oakley faced with the flop-to-the-floor acting skills of Reggie Miller. The 22-year-old Swiss epeeist with the platinum blond hair jawed at his victorious opponent, the Frenchman Hugues Obry, then fulminated for an hour in three tongues.</p>
        <p>''He's falling down like a dead man,'' Fischer said. ''I just asked him if he thinks this is fair play because he knows it's not correct.''</p>
        <p>Fischer insisted that the referee was fooled into levying a point against him because of Obry's Milleresque maneuvers.</p>
        <p>''He could only say nothing,'' Fischer said. ''He knows what he did is not fair play. He's a good player, but the referee was not good.''</p>
        <p>In this sport of physical chess, Obry and Fischer were a baby step away from full-blown trash-talking. In his riposte to Fischer, after losing the subsequent gold-medal bout to Pavel Kolobkov of Russia, Obry said he was not silent when Fischer confronted him on the elevated strip at the Sydney Exhibition Center.</p>
        <p>''I told him there was a referee and he should obey the rules, and if he pushes and jostles me, it's not the way to go,'' Obry said.</p>
        <p>''He did it twice and he was sanctioned. I was not surprised he did it the first time, but surprised he started again.''</p>
        <p>Accusations aside, the first day of fencing at the Summer Olympics demonstrated that organized dueling can be competed with ferocious, hockeylike aggression and accompanied by fevered fan reaction. Obry was urged on by fans screaming his name. Kolobkov was exhorted, with shouts of ''O-Leg!'' and ''Rus-sia! Rus-sia!'' When Fischer protested his loss to Obry, his partisans hooted and hollered as if the referee had lost total sight of the strike zone.</p>
        <p>Obry was effusive in his reactions, ripping off his mask and pumping his fist when he scored touches against Fischer and Kolobkov. Eventually, Fischer shed his reticence to celebrate by pumping his clenched fist and racing along the 59-foot-long strip to cheer his hits to Obry.</p>
        <p>And when he was defeated, 15-14, for the bronze by Sang-Ki Lee of South Korea, Fischer kneeled on the strip and pounded his forehead three times with his left hand.</p>
        <p>The drama of the Obry-Fischer contretemps was prelude to Kolobkov's 15-12 victory over Obry, the 1998 world champion. They fought evenly, as Obry held his own against the favorite (and silver medalist eight years ago in Barcelona) from his station as the 22nd-seeded fencer. Nine times they scored simultaneous hits. Once, Obry scored a rear hit while being decked by a forearm shiver from Kolobkov. (In the epee competition, a hit can be scored when the weapon touches anywhere on an opponent.)</p>
        <p>With Kolobkov ahead by 12-10, Obry scored a touch on his foe's leg,, but he could not prevail. The Russian won, 15-12. When the green light signaled his victory, Kolobkov sent his mask soaring and members of the Russian fencing team rushed the stage and flung him twice in the air and onto their shoulders.</p>
        <p>''I only had the faith I would win at the final point,'' Kolobkov, 30, said afterward. ''Until then, I felt tension and emotion not comparable to anything I've experienced before.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''The competition is over and it was like a nightmare.''</p>
        <p>Said Obry: ''I was not a favorite and to come out with a silver is a great victory. If someone had told me a year ago that I would win the silver, I'd have said he was crazy.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Lee, an office assistant in Seoul, said he was pleased to win a bronze medal under the flag of the two Koreas, who marched together Friday night at the opening ceremony.</p>
        <p>''I was unable to attend the ceremony, but I'm so happy about the possibility of unification,'' he said. ''The Koreans in South Korea want to be close to North Korea. So we entered together and we hope we can unify the Koreas.''</p>
        <p>The only American in the epee tournament, Tamir Bloom, the 31st-seed fencer who is a student at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, won his first match against Andrei Murashko of Belarus, but lost his next bout against Germany's Arnd Schmitt, the 1988 Olympic gold medalist. Schmitt, a dentist seeded No. 2, subsequently fell to Fischer.</p>
