        <p>THOSE who found few bargains on travel to Europe last summer, when flights were full and coach fares to Lisbon, for example, were running over $900, are likely to welcome fall, when low-cost packages arrive. For less than the price of a round-trip air ticket in summer, tour companies in off season sell combinations of flights, hotels and elements like sightseeing tours or transfers between the airport and the hotel.</p>
        <p>The situation is hugely seasonal. As one operator said, the income from full planes in summer helps to pay for flights in the winter, when the per-passenger cost is increased by smaller loads and the occasional need to de-ice planes. So if a plane is flying 30 percent empty, it benefits an airline to sign a contract with an operator to sell the empty seats for very little.</p>

        <p>THOSE who found few bargains on travel to Europe last summer, when flights were full and coach fares to Lisbon, for example, were running over $900, are likely to welcome fall, when low-cost packages arrive. For less than the price of a round-trip air ticket in summer, tour companies in off season sell combinations of flights, hotels and elements like sightseeing tours or transfers between the airport and the hotel.</p>
        <p>The situation is hugely seasonal. As one operator said, the income from full planes in summer helps to pay for flights in the winter, when the per-passenger cost is increased by smaller loads and the occasional need to de-ice planes. So if a plane is flying 30 percent empty, it benefits an airline to sign a contract with an operator to sell the empty seats for very little.</p>
        <p>However the package is composed, the price is printed in big numbers, and ''double occupancy,'' ''weekday departures'' and airport ''fees and government taxes'' of $50 to $125 are in smaller type; hotel taxes and service charges are normally included. These factors affect the final cost of packages, and potential buyers should ask about all of them. In addition, when prices are stunningly low, the packages may be of cometlike duration and fraught with asterisks and howevers.</p>
        <p>For example, because of restrictions on dates, a three-night London package that British Airways Holidays advertises for Nov. 1 to 30 can be bought at its lowest price, $409, for only three departure dates: Nov. 5, 12 and 26, all Sundays.</p>
        <p>Watch the Calendar</p>
        <p>This package, which covers air fare from New York, three nights' hotel in double occupancy, Continental breakfast, service and hotel tax is being sold only until Sept. 30. Departing on Thursday, Friday or Saturday raises the cost $25, as does returning on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. So there goes $50, if you're not careful. There is a $30 surcharge for Nov. 21 to 24, over Thanksgiving.</p>
        <p>At this price -- and there are higher ones -- the hotels are the Tavi stock, with 345 rooms, and the Royal National, with 1,432, which the company rates at two diamonds: ''fairly basic'' accommodations that are well-maintained but with limited amenities. They have private baths and showers. Both are near the Russell Square Underground station.</p>
        <p>John Muller, manager of operations for British Airways Holidays, describes the $409 package as tactical pricing: ''We are interested in seeing more people travel at certain times,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For November, the least expensive British Airways round trip from New York would be $352. This must be bought 45 days in advance, for weekday flights and with a Saturday night stay, a restriction waived for the package.</p>
        <p>For November, the Tavistock said, it would charge each of two guests in a room $57 a night, with the pound at $1.46, including Continental breakfast, service charges and tax, for a total of $171 a person for three nights. The Royal National gave its November rate as the equivalent of $60 a person a night, for $180 for three nights, including Continental breakfast, tax and service.</p>
        <p>So an individual trying to replicate the $409 package would pay at least $523 at the Tavistock, $532 at the Royal National, and the days of the week would be constricted.</p>
        <p>British Airways Holidays: (800) 359-8722.</p>
        <p>A London package with a voucher for a choice of plays in the West End is offered by Insight Vacations for people who want a higher-quality hotel. With the theater ticket; air fare on British Airways from New York; transfers from and to the airport; six nights, double occupancy, at the Kensington Hilton with Continental breakfasts; and a half-day sightseeing tour, this comes to $995 for four Saturday departures in November and Dec. 2 and 9.</p>
        <p>The Kensington Hilton said its best rate for a six-night stay in November, including a full breakfast and hotel tax, would be $106 a person a night, making six nights worth $636. A West End theater ticket in the stalls -- the equivalent of the orchestra -- is about $50; if bought separately from the Applause agency in New York, it would cost $95.</p>
        <p>The British Tourist Authority said that round-trip bus transfers between Heathrow Airport and a downtown hotel would cost about $17.50; this would involve stops at many hotels. The half-day sightseeing tour was put at an average of $40 each.</p>
        <p>With a theater ticket bought there,  the package components would cost $1,095 at the hotel rate quoted above.  The hotel said rates for certain days might be as low as $83 a person a night, but with no breakfast. Continental breakfast costs $14.50, English breakfast, $22.</p>
        <p>Insight Vacations: 745 Atlantic Avenue, Suite 720, Boston, Mass. 02111; (617) 482-2000; Web site www.insight vacations.com.</p>
        <p>A Roman Holiday</p>
        <p>TourCrafters is resuming a $599 five-night package to Rome, from Nov. 16 to Dec. 14. The elements are round-trip air fare on Alitalia from New York, Boston, Chicago or Miami, not including taxes and airport fees; five nights, double occupancy, at the three-star Hotel Brasile, 13 Via Palestro, near the railroad station; and Continental breakfast.</p>
        <p>A New York-Rome round-trip ticket on a weekday from Nov. 1 to March 18, with a Sunday night stay, was quoted by Alitalia at $398, plus taxes. On the weekend, it would be $438. The hotel, called direct, quoted a rate of $57 a person (based on two people in a room), including buffet breakfast, service charges and taxes. This would mean that elements in the five-night package, purchased invididually for weekday travel, would cost $683, or for weekend travel, $723.</p>
        <p>TourCrafters: 28085 North Ashley Circle, 202B, Libertyville, Ill. 60048; (800) 621-2259; www.tourcrafters .com.</p>
        <p>Paris Visit</p>
        <p>ETM Travel Group is offering three nights in double occupancy in Paris with Continental breakfast and a two-hour Cityrama sightseeing tour for $499, with departures on Continental Airlines from Newark on Thursday, Friday or Saturday. The offer starts Nov. 1 and runs to March 31, with a blackout Dec. 12 to 24.</p>
        <p>The lowest Continental fare to Paris for November is $415. For its least expensive package, ETM uses a small hotel in the First Arrondissement, Des Victoires at 19, rue Herold, which quotes a rate of $53 a person a night for a double room, with the franc at 7.3 to the dollar. Creating the equivalent of the ETM package would thus mean $415 for air fare and $159 for the hotel, plus $25 for the Cityrama tour, a total of $599.</p>
        <p>Des Victoires, with 58 rooms, has recently been renovated. It has no restaurant, but provides breakfast in a brick-walled area with arches; breakfast in the room is also available. On the ETM package, extra nights there are $57 a person.</p>
        <p>ETM: 237 Post Road, Westport, Conn. 06880; (800) 992-7700; www. etmtravelgroup.com.</p>
        <p>Every one of these packages has prices for extra nights, nicer hotels, choicer days, even travel in blackout periods. Like the special on laundry detergent that gets you into the market, these packages put you in the right frame of mind for spending a little more.</p>
