        <p>I was 19 and had worked my way across the country for the previous six months driving a bus for a small repertory company called the Bishops, out of Southern California. I abandoned the bus in the middle of Times Square and I remember watching the red butt of it move away from me down 42nd Street and thinking, ''Now Im really in for it. One hot tip Id picked up from a tall, skinny actor on the bus was about the Burns Detective Agency. Hed told me it was a sure-fire job opportunity if everything else failed. My immediate mission, though, was a cheeseburger, but I had zip in my pocket.</p>
        <p>I found myself hovering outside the plate-glass window of a White Castle watching the cook scoop big mounds of fried onions onto a row of sizzling greasy burgers and then flopping slices of white cheese on top that bubbled and popped like Elmers glue. Id never seen burgers done like this before.</p>

        <p>I was 19 and had worked my way across the country for the previous six months driving a bus for a small repertory company called the Bishops, out of Southern California. I abandoned the bus in the middle of Times Square and I remember watching the red butt of it move away from me down 42nd Street and thinking, ''Now Im really in for it. One hot tip Id picked up from a tall, skinny actor on the bus was about the Burns Detective Agency. Hed told me it was a sure-fire job opportunity if everything else failed. My immediate mission, though, was a cheeseburger, but I had zip in my pocket.</p>
        <p>I found myself hovering outside the plate-glass window of a White Castle watching the cook scoop big mounds of fried onions onto a row of sizzling greasy burgers and then flopping slices of white cheese on top that bubbled and popped like Elmers glue. Id never seen burgers done like this before.</p>
        <p>Whores of various nationalities were hitting on me, although I didnt recognize their intentions at first. I thought maybe all the girls in New York were just friendly. Weird bald guys with flashy vests were trying to lure me into strip joints. Id never seen sex so out-front, except maybe in Tijuana.</p>
        <p>There was a big white sign in a storefront with red letters that read: ''GIVE A PINT OF BLOOD -- GET $5 CASH.I went in and climbed the stairs to a little office. The stairs smelled like garbage. The iron handrail was sticky. Inside the office was a legitimate-looking nurse in a white uniform sitting behind an oak desk. She had me fill out a form and sign my blood away. She took me into a back room with a green plastic curtain, a metal chair and a little table with stainless-steel trays holding syringes and needles and a glass apothecary jar filled with cotton balls. She tied off the vein on my left arm with a thin, blond rubber hose. I watched the blood slowly fill the syringe. It was rich, dark red. The nurse never looked me in the eyes. Not once. I took the five bucks and went straight back down to the White Castle, sat on one of those chrome stools and ordered me a cheeseburger with fried onions and all that gooey white cheese, just like Id seen in the window. It was one of the best things Id ever tasted.</p>
        <p>Next day I became a Burns Detective right off the bat. My actor friend was right. I had a brown uniform with a badge, a club, a Marine-looking hat and one of those timecard clocks that I wore on my hip in a black leather pouch. My mission was to guard a whole fleet of coal barges on the East River from 8 p.m. until 4 in the morning. My station was a little 4-by-14 wooden hut set on the edge of the docks overlooking the Con Ed smokestack and the shimmering, oily river. There wasnt a soul around. Just me, the river and the barges. I had to walk from one end of the dock to the other every 15 minutes, insert a key that hung on a pipe into my clock and turn it, causing a punch mark to appear on the card inside to prove that Id done my duty. It was probably the most peaceful job in New York City, and I never could fathom why anyone would want to vandalize a coal barge.</p>
        <p>My next gig was really my first introduction to the heart and soul of life in the Big City: busboy at the famed Village Gate. Suddenly I was in the thick of it. In the early 60s the Gate was the mecca of jazz in the entire country, and like magic, I was delivered into the belly of it as a stunned witness. Thelonius Monk mauling the piano with his huge hands, doing his little shuffle-step hat dance around the stage then returning to the stool to begin the hauntingly simple melody line of '''Round About Midnight. Right away I recognized that this was the real thing. This was music unschooled, totally inspired and coming directly from the experience of the man playing it. Like a story by a campfire in the middle of nowhere. Charles Mingus unleashing torrential angry riffs through ''Fables of Faubus, chanting ''FAUB-ASS into the face of a mostly white audience. Nina Simone in her absolutely scary rendition of ''Jenny the Pirate. Cannonball Adderly and his brother shaking the whole place down with saxophone frenzy. Dizzy Gillespie busting his round face into that weird-looking horn with the gold bell pointing straight up to the rafters. Ella Fitzgerald, Gerry Mulligan, Mongo Santamaria, Coleman Hawkins, Roland Kirk, Eric Dolphy -- Id come reeling out of the place at daybreak when the garbagemen were just finishing up, and I remember that first blast of fresh, crisp morning air tinged with the rank smells of the clubbers leftover salads and steaks and the sounds of glass crashing as the garbage trucks churned away, pulverizing everything back into itself, and I was heading for the Lower East Side and Tompkins Square Park and a bowl of hot borscht at the Polish joint and no one was on the streets, not a single soul, and I thought to myself the only thing to be in this life is an artist. Thats the only thing that makes any sense.</p>
