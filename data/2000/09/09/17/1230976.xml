        <p>Name: Mubenga Kanyinda  Age: 28  Coming from: Congo  Looking for: Freedom</p>
        <p>I had to leave my country,'' whispered Mubenga Kanyinda in a voice so soft I could barely hear him. It was a Thursday morning in early February, and Kan-</p>
        <p>yinda was sitting across from me inside a narrow room with pale blue walls and harsh fluorescent lighting. He was shy and slightly bewildered-looking, with dark eyes that circled the room warily. He wore the bright orange jumpsuit and canvas slip-ons that are standard issue at the Wackenhut detention center, where Kanyinda, a refugee from Congo, had spent virtually every moment since arriving in New York 11 weeks earlier.</p>
        <p>It's an experience that has grown sadly familiar to that special class of newcomers -- foreigners fleeing persecution -- whom New York, and in turn America, is supposed to be famous for welcoming. Located just past John F. Kennedy airport in Jamaica, Queens, amid a cluster of warehouse buildings and airport cargo stations, Wackenhut is the first, and very often the final, destination for the hundreds of asylum seekers who arrive in the city each year. The 200-bed detention facility, a sprawling tan-and-brown brick building equipped with cameras and metal detectors, opened its doors in February 1997, shortly after Congress passed the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform law. That law included a provision, known as ''mandatory detention,'' that requires the Immigration and Naturalization Service to detain all asylum seekers who arrive in the U.S. without valid documents.</p>
        <p>Prior to the 1996 law, the I.N.S. often released newcomers who lacked proper paperwork but were not considered a threat to the community. Under the new policy, however, people like Kanyinda are routinely detained for months, sometimes years, before learning whether they will be granted asylum -- or deported to their homelands. For Kanyinda, as for many of the detainees at Wackenhut, nothing less than survival was at stake. ''If I go back, they will kill me,'' he said, and proceeded to chronicle an almost surreal litany of horrors.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, in the spring of 1997, Kanyinda said, he was sitting at home with his father in the southern Congolese city where he grew up when a dozen soldiers under the command of Laurent Kabila, the rebel leader whose forces had just deposed the long-ruling Mobutu regime, stormed the premises. Kanyinda and his father, who had served as a conseiller, or local official, under Mobutu, and so was a prime target for political reprisal, were whisked away to the nearby Kasapa prison. The following night, Kanyinda heard the sound of prisoners digging a ditch outside his cell. He would later learn that his father's body had been thrown into that ditch.</p>
        <p>Kanyinda spent the next 14 months in a cramped, windowless prison cell where, he said, guards beat him repeatedly with rifle butts and cut him with knives. Members of the Apostolic Church, a Protestant denomination to which he belonged, eventually secured his release. He spent several months recuperating under his mother's care. But Kanyinda's mother was an ethnic Tutsi, and in the fall of 1998 the Kabila regime went to war with the Tutsi-led government of Rwanda, unleashing a wave of anti-Tutsi violence throughout Congo. Kanyinda and his family tried to flee to Zambia, but their car was stopped at the border, and Kanyinda looked on helplessly as security guards shot and killed his mother.</p>
        <p>Kanyinda was sent back to prison, where, in one of those improbable twists upon which survival sometimes depends, the newly appointed warden turned out to be an old friend of his father's. In February 1999 Kanyinda was released again and this time managed to cross the border into Zambia. He spent several months in hiding there. Then, with help from his church contacts, he obtained a false Canadian passport and money for a plane ticket. On Nov. 15, 1999, Kanyinda boarded a direct flight to New York.</p>
        <p>Freedom seemed tantalizingly near. But moments after he stepped off the plane at J.F.K. with his black duffel bag -- his only luggage -- Kanyinda's luck ran out. At customs, I.N.S. officials deemed his passport to be suspicious-looking, and he was detained. During the 12-hour interrogation that followed, handcuffs were placed once more around his wrists. The police concluded Kanyinda's papers were indeed fake, and he was transferred by van to Wackenhut.</p>
        <p>Though confused and frightened, Kanyinda was, in a sense, lucky. Under a provision of the 1996 Immigration Law known as ''expedited removal,'' immigration officers at the airport could have simply sent Kanyinda on the next plane back to Africa -- before he'd even had a chance to consult with a lawyer or appear before an immigration judge. Instead, Kanyinda was stripped and fitted into Wackenhut prison scrubs and escorted to his new home: a windowless dorm room crammed with 40 detainees who eat, sleep, shower and go to the bathroom under the surveillance of armed guards. When Kanyinda first realized that Wackenhut was a detention facility, he told me, he burst into a fit of tears.</p>
        <p>There were, however, no tears, indeed few outward signs of any emotion, during my initial encounters with Kanyinda. When I asked him a question, Kanyinda would nod politely, then recount details from his past in a tone that was eerily flat, as though he were describing the experiences of another person. Long, awkward silences would punctuate our talks, perhaps because of the language barrier. (Kanyinda tried speaking English but often switched, midsentence, to his native French.) Then again, his withdrawn manner was most likely a sign of post-traumatic stress disorder, according to Dr. Kenneth Rosen, a psychiatrist who visited Wackenhut around this time. ''The magnitude of the horrors which have befallen him,'' Rosen later wrote in an evaluation, ''are beyond the coping capabilities of his thought process.''</p>
        <p>Two things seemed to keep Kanyinda from losing hope. One was his religious faith. ''Each day inside, I pray,'' he told me. ''I prefer the church to politics, because I know a lot of people who have lost their lives to politics.'' More important, he had made contact with the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, a New York-based organization that works to provide indigent asylum seekers with legal representation -- and advocates the use of alternatives to detention, like refugee accommodation centers and supervised release programs. In January, Kanyinda secured the pro bono services of Carmela Guerrero and Mina Kim, two first-year associates at the Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell law firm in Manhattan. In March, Guerrero and Kim repeatedly trekked out to Wackenhut to meet with Kanyinda and begin preparing his case. Their visits grew more frequent as the day of Kanyinda's scheduled asylum hearing, April 26, approached.</p>
        <p>When I visited Kanyinda a few weeks before his court date, there were signs that he was beginning to imagine life beyond confinement.</p>
        <p>''If the judge permits me to live outside,'' he said, ''I will first be with the Apostolic Church, and second find a job.''</p>
        <p>What kind of job, I asked?</p>
        <p>''Agriculture,'' he answered. ''Chicken incubation is something I learned in the Congo.''</p>
        <p>When I mentioned that New York City did not exactly abound in poultry farms, he was unfazed. ''In order to sustain myself I will work at whatever is available,'' he said, smiling -- the first time I had seen him do so.</p>
        <p>Also for the first time, Kanyinda began airing his views about Wackenhut, where, twice in the past two years, detainees have staged hunger strikes to protest their prolonged detention without parole. (Under current law, the I.N.S. does have discretion to release asylum seekers on parole, but the agency's decisions are notoriously arbitrary.) During one of the hunger strikes, a Congolese man who'd been detained for more than a year attempted suicide by swallowing a mixture of painkillers and Ben Gay ointment. Another man slashed his arm with a razor blade after being placed in solitary confinement, which Kanyinda told me was a constant fear among detainees.</p>
        <p>''You can be put in there for anything,'' he said, mentioning that at one point guards warned him there would be repercussions for meeting with me. (Kanyinda was so frightened that he did not eat for two days and canceled one of our interviews.) ''We don't get any fresh air, any sunlight,'' he complained. ''We never go outside.''</p>
        <p>As I learned on a subsequent tour of the facility, there is a small courtyard at Wackenhut, but it is enclosed by thick cement walls and a tightly woven chain-link roof, meaning that for five months, Kanyinda had not so much as glimpsed the open sky. On the day I visited, the facility appeared clean and well kept, with a Ping-Pong table and TV set in each dorm, and a small indoor recreation room, library and in-house barbershop. However, the dank air and narrow hallways induced a sense of claustrophobia. Though I was not allowed to speak to any detainees, several stared out from their dorms, looking desperately bored. After 45 minutes, I needed to step outside for fresh air.</p>
        <p>''My father used to tell me that America is a country where rights are respected,'' said Kan-</p>
        <p>yinda. ''But I have not lived this as a reality.'' Was he craving justice? Kanyinda smiled slyly. ''I cannot speak about justice yet. Justice will come on the 26th.''</p>
        <p>Or so Kanyinda thought. to prove that his life would be in danger in Congo, Kanyinda's lawyers had prepared a thick raft of supporting evidence, including an affidavit from a physician confirming that Kanyinda's arms and legs bore lesions consistent with his account of knifings and torture. Also presented were sworn statements from several experts on conditions in Congo, including that of Herbert Weiss, an emeritus professor of political science at the City University of New York. ''A Tutsi connection like his is close to the kiss of death in the Congo,'' Weiss told me on the morning of Kanyinda's hearing, which was held inside a small courtroom on the second floor of Wackenhut.</p>
        <p>Yet these arguments did not persuade Judge Steven Abrams -- largely because, at the hearing, an I.N.S. attorney presented a seemingly authentic employment record that had been seized with Kanyinda's personal possessions at J.F.K. This document indicated that, from April 1994 until November 1998 -- well past the date Kanyinda claimed he was initially imprisoned in Congo -- he had been working as a supervisor on a poultry farm in Zambia. Kanyinda said that he had fabricated these dates, hoping it would help him obtain a job in America. But Judge Abrams wasn't convinced, and he ordered the lawyers to return to court on May 17 with documents from the poultry farm in Zambia clarifying Kanyinda's employment history, along with further verification that his father really was a former official in the Mobutu regime. Without additional documentation, he warned, Kanyinda's asylum application would be denied.</p>
        <p>''I feel horrible,'' said Carmela Guerrero, ashen-faced, in the car ride back from Wackenhut. She had reason to worry. Eleanor Acer, coordinator of the asylum program at the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, said: ''Judges keep requesting increasing levels of documentation for asylum seekers. The trouble is, most refugees don't come here with any authentic documents.'' And they usually don't have a lawyer either. According to a study just completed by Andrew Schoenholtz, an immigration expert at Georgetown University, more than one-third of asylum seekers who appear in court do so without representation. Such individuals are five times as likely to be sent home.</p>
        <p>Even with a deep-pocketed law firm on his side, Kanyinda's chances appeared razor thin. How would his lawyers be able to confirm his father's identity without access to documents in Congo -- a country engulfed in civil war where most such records, even if they exist, are impossible to track down? And what about the poultry farm in Zambia? When Carmela Guerrero tried calling and e-mailing the address on the employment record, nobody answered. In desperation, Davis Polk hired a Zambian law firm to contact the farm, but days passed without resolution. Guerrero grew despondent. Her colleague, Mina Kim, was certain the case was lost.</p>
        <p>Then on May 15, two days before the hearing, an officially notarized letter from Zambia whirred through Guerrero's fax machine. Signed by an administrator at the Hybrid Poultry Farm in Lusaka, Zambia, the letter stated that, according to the farm's records, Kanyinda had indeed worked there -- but only for three months in 1994. At about the same time, Guerrero received an e-mail from Jean Paul Bolondo, a former Congolese democracy activist who now works at the World Bank, who said he could confirm the identity of Kanyinda's father.</p>
        <p>The lawyers returned to Wackenhut. ''The last few weeks have been excruciating,'' confessed Guerrero. ''You get so emotionally attached. Kanyinda told me his life was in my hands.'' She entered the courtroom. Soon after, she reappeared, an exuberant smile on her face. Kanyinda had been granted his freedom.</p>
        <p>A few hours later, freshly shaved and dressed in jeans and a checkered shirt, Kanyinda emerged, beaming, from behind the heavy metal doors of Wackenhut. He inhaled his first real breath of New York air, gazed at the sun-drenched spring sky, then tossed his possessions in the back of a livery cab. Kanyinda wanted to see the Statue of Liberty, and so, with Carmela Guerrero and me at his side, the livery cab barreled down the Harlem River Drive toward Battery Park, weaving through the early evening traffic while Kanyinda stared out the window at the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan, the largest buildings he had ever seen. When the car stopped, we crossed the park. Kanyinda leaned over the rail outside Castle Clinton, the Hudson River glistening beneath a delicate orange sunset, and stood transfixed for several moments, his eyes welling with emotion.</p>
        <p>''Justice has finally arrived,'' he declared.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Kanyinda said he wanted to eat an authentic New York meal, so we went to Katz's Delicatessen and ordered heaping corned beef sandwiches. Kanyinda removed the top slice of bread and ate his sandwich open-faced, with a fork and knife. ''Too much,'' he said, staring down at his unfinished plate. But he was happy, he said, never to ''have to eat at Wackenhut again.''</p>
        <p>Kanyinda's newfound freedom hardly put an end to the challenges he would confront. He left Wackenhut with no bank account, no apartment, limited knowledge of English, and no known family members in the New York area. He was so desperate for cash that Davis Polk lawyers simply gave him the $250 they had intended to spend on a celebratory dinner. Although he would soon be eligible for federal refugee cash assistance, this amounted to a mere $162 per month. And while Kanyinda was eager to get a job, he lacked a work permit, which takes months to process. ''Folks who are released from detention have a tendency to think their journey is over,'' said Will Coley, director of the Jesuit Refugee Service in New Jersey, which assists asylum seekers with their transition into society. ''But it's not.'' Coley said he had seen former detainees in homeless shelters and on the streets. ''It's especially hard for people trying to settle in New York City.''</p>
        <p>But New York also has its advantages -- in particular, the matrix of immigrant communities that serves as a safety net for so many of the city's newcomers. While at Wackenhut, Kanyinda had gotten to know several other Congolese asylum seekers, and one of these, a man named Eddie, had a sister who told Kanyinda about an evangelical church on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn that might help him find housing. It was through the church that Kanyinda met Gigi, a friendly, round-faced man, originally from Kinshasa (the capital of Congo), who offered him room and board in his fourth-floor apartment in Bushwick for just $200 a month.</p>
        <p>Kanyinda moved into the cramped, two-bedroom quarters that Gigi already shared with another person, and, during the next few weeks, slowly adjusted to life in the city. To improve his language skills, he enrolled in English classes at the downtown Brooklyn branch of Cambpo, an organization that provides free social services to refugees. He began riding the subway, befriending people at church and learning there was much more to New York than Wackenhut, though the memory of being there still clearly haunted him. One month after his release, Kanyinda joined the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights on a trip to Ellis Island, where he met Dr. Allen Keller, who runs the Program for Survivors of Torture at New York University's School of Medicine. Dr. Keller asked Kanyinda whether being at Wackenhut had made it difficult for him to overcome his memories of torture. ''Being in detention was itself torture,'' he replied. ''There is physical torture and then there is the torture of one's morale.''</p>
        <p>Strolling through the Ellis Island Immigration Museum afterward, Kanyinda stopped in front of a cartoon, originally printed in Puck's magazine, that depicted a mass of immigrants lining up to enter America. ''Welcome to All,'' read the caption. ''Oh, really?'' Kanyinda commented.</p>
        <p>Like many newcomers, Kanyinda seemed to find America an enchanting -- if unusual -- place. ''I've noticed that people here are very busy with work,'' he told me on the ferry ride back from Ellis Island. ''I see people who leave one job during the day and begin another one at night.'' This struck him as odd, given America's inordinate wealth. He was also surprised by the extraordinarily fast pace of life here. ''Everyone here is in a big rush,'' he said. But Kanyinda did not seem intimidated. ''I like New York too much,'' he said. ''I have met many good people, especially at church.''</p>
        <p>Among his new acquaintances, it turns out, was a relative living in the city whom Kanyinda had never met before. ''A man approached me in church one day and asked me, 'Where did you get the name Kanyinda?' ''he explained. ''Then he said, 'I know who you are.' ''The man, it turns out, was a distant cousin, and he gave Kanyinda several hundred dollars.</p>
        <p>Even with help from newly discovered relatives, however, life was far from easy. Although Gigi had deferred Kanyinda's rent during his first months in the city, in July he told him that he could not continue putting him up free. For several days, Kanyinda scrambled to find housing. He eventually wound up moving into a church shelter in Williamsburg. ''It's all right,'' he told me, trying to remain optimistic, though he sounded shaken.</p>
        <p>What Kanyinda most desired was to find steady work, which, he was learning, was readily available. One day, he called me to report that there were entry-level openings at the Federal Express branch in J.F.K. airport. (He laughed aloud at the idea of returning to J.F.K.) A few days later, Kanyinda informed me that he was considering commuting to Connecticut to work at a chicken hatchery; the prospect of resuming his old profession appealed to him. But after visiting Connecticut Kanyinda admitted to feeling wary. ''It's a very good job,'' he explained. ''But I was afraid. I saw only white people there.''</p>
        <p>As he weighed his options this summer, Kanyinda seemed to be putting the trauma of his recent experiences behind him, though not so much that he forgot what it was like to be in detention. One day in July, Kanyinda learned from his lawyer Carmela Guerrero about a Congolese woman who was being detained at the I.N.S. facility in Elizabeth, N. J., and who, like Kanyinda, was at risk of being denied asylum because she lacked documents verifying her identity. The woman, Kanyinda discovered, was from the same town in Congo as he was, and he knew her family. Kanyinda agreed to submit an affidavit on her behalf -- an affidavit that helped her win her case.</p>
        <p>A few weeks later, Kanyinda visited the woman, Adolphine, in New Jersey. They exchanged a warm hug, then talked excitedly for several hours in Swahili. The dynamic between them was buoyant, even flirtatious. It made me wonder if a romance might be brewing. Afterward, Kanyinda told me that while he indeed liked Adolphine, he thought they should remain friends, since they were not of the same tribe -- a frequent source of friction in Congo. But Kanyinda clearly felt a deep affinity for someone whose experience so closely paralleled his own, and who, like him, would be facing daunting challenges in the months ahead. ''Some of my friends asked me, why do you want to help her -- she is of different ethnicity,'' he said. ''But in Africa it's different. This is America, and here we have to stick together.''</p>
