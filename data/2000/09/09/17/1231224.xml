        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a resident of Cherry Hill in South Jersey I have always felt neglected by the New Jersey Section. In carrying news, it always seemed to stop at Trenton, but on Aug. 13, lo and behold, our region made up almost the entire section. The article about Cozy Morley, the Jersey Shore comedic institution, the On the Map about the boat pilot from Barnegat light who steered for ''A Perfect Storm,'' and the cover article about Cumberland County come to mind. It was nice to see the South Jersey area included in this issue. You must do it again and soon.</p>
