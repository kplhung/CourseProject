        <p>At one time, the Hoboken waterfront was filled with ships and the Hudson River was a busy highway.

        <p>At one time, the Hoboken waterfront was filled with ships and the Hudson River was a busy highway. Antonio Jacobsen, a Danish artist who lived most of his life in Hoboken, loved to paint the ships. John McMullen, a youth whose father owned a ship repair shop in Hoboken, loved to look at them.</p>
        <p>These days, Antonio Jacobsen, who lived from 1850 to 1921, is considered one of the world's most famous marine artists, and Dr. John J. McMullen is the owner of Norton Lilly, the oldest shipping agency in the Western Hemisphere. Dr. McMullen has been a naval commander, a naval architect, a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the president of United States Lines, the former chairman of the Houston Astros and, until recently, the owner of the New Jersey Devils. He also has the largest private collection of Jacobsen paintings in the world.</p>
        <p>''It's been a lot of fun along the way,'' said Dr. McMullen, his dog Bubba at his side in his Secaucus office. The hallways, stairs and offices are lined with Jacobsen paintings of steamships and barks, packet boats and passenger ships, pilot boats and clipper ships sailing the bounding main. And he has grand plans for the future. He hopes someday to start a museum in Hoboken or Jersey City to house his collection of marine art as well as the art from the American West that he collects.</p>
        <p>A sense of delight is one of the hallmarks of an art collector, according to John Hightower, president of the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Va. The museum has the largest public collection of Jacobsen's works, and some of Dr. McMullen's collection has been exhibited there.</p>
        <p>''First and foremost, collectors have passion,'' Mr. Hightower said. ''They really delight in paintings. They are also very interested in their value and their worth. They're risk-takers, and they trust their eye and have impeccable taste. I think that John McMullen, who probably doesn't have any abstract expressionist paintings, could go into an abstract expressionist gallery and pick out the best.''</p>
        <p>The first painting Dr. McMullen bought was not a Jacobsen. It was a small Picasso of Dora Maar he bought in Zurich when he was getting his doctorate in technical science, around 1950. ''I had the opportunity to see the great private collections in Switzerland,'' Dr. McMullen recalls. ''They were so impressive. I started getting interested. I had been at sea. I had never been to any museums.''</p>
        <p>Dr. McMullen, who is in his 80's, started collecting Jacobsen paintings when he returned from the Navy in 1959. It began with two Jacobsens he retrieved from his late father's ship repair loft on Clinton Street in Hoboken. He hung them in his new naval architecture firm on Battery Place in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people recognized them and the more they recognized them the more I got into it.'' Thirty or 40 years ago, a Jacobsen might have cost $500 or $600, he said. These days some go for $50,000. He has 60, compared with 275 in The Mariners' Museum.</p>
        <p>His blue eyes twinkling, Dr. McMullen leans over to tell a story. ''There was a funny thing that happened once. Somebody tried to sell me a Jacobsen of the Titanic. But Jacobsen painted all his paintings over here, and the Titanic never got to this country. I told him to bring it over. I said I'd give him a dollar for it.''</p>
        <p>Dr. McMullen talked about his favorite Jacobsens. They are the paintings of ships he has seen himself, like the steam-sail ships of the Wilson Lines out of Liverpool.  Dr. McMullen, who is old enough to call the Hudson by its early name, the North River, recalls seeing the Queen Mary, the Queen Elizabeth, the Normandie. ''Some of the Italian ships were great,'' he said. ''My father used to take me down and show me them all. They were so beautiful.''</p>
        <p>What does a connoisseur think makes a ship beautiful? ''Ships are nowhere as beautiful as they used to be,'' Dr. McMullen said. ''Back in the days of clipper ships they were gorgeous. It's the sail, steam and mechanical propulsion that make the lines of the ship, the curve of the bow, the shape of the transom and the general profile, that is the thing that attracts your attention. The form has to conform to the hydrodynamics.</p>
        <p>''A civil architect has so much more freedom in style than the naval architect who has to obey the rule of hydrodynamic form as it passes through the water,'' he said a bit ruefully, knowing about designing ships.</p>
        <p>Philip B. Kimball, executive director of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers in Jersey City, said he remembered the day he met Dr. McMullen almost 40 years ago. ''Dr. McMullen was a large figure in the development of many ship designs,'' Mr. Kimball said. ''His name was synonymous with the marine industry.'' Dr. McMullen helped a group of architectural students, including Mr. Kimball, attend an annual meeting of the society in 1962.</p>
        <p>Dr. McMullen is still an active in shipping  but sometimes he pauses to remember the way things used to be. ''Last week or so we had a dinner at the World Trade Center,'' he said, ''and you look up along the North River and you shake your head. At one time that was all lined with ships!''</p>
        <p>But he does not dwell in the past. Yes, he will miss the Devils, but he is looking forward to seeing more of his grandson's hockey games, and then there is that museum he would like to start near the waterfront.</p>
