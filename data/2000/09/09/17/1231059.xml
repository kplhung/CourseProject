        <p>IN his diaries from the heyday of abstract painting in the 1950's, Ad Reinhardt (1913-1967) observed that each time he started a new canvas, he felt a frisson of awe -- and an inevitable weight of familiarity. He suggested that each new work was, perhaps inescapably, one and the same with those that came before it.</p>
        <p>Decades later, in the 1970's, process art, with links to abstraction and minimalism, called attention to how artists manipulated their media: sometimes finished objects looked like specimens from testing labs for industrial materials -- a transformation that was exactly the artists' point.</p>
        <p>The lessons of those eras and the artistic self-awareness they awakened are still discernible in the paintings of Louise Fishman. Ms. Fishman, who was born and grew up in Philadelphia, is now 61 years old. Over the years this self-described ''third-generation Abstract Expressionist'' has not dominated art-world headlines, but since settling in New York in 1965, she has created a substantial body of work that has been shown regularly in gallery and museum shows and that has won the admiration of dealers, collectors and other artists for her dogged commitment to the language, ethos and expressive power of abstraction.</p>
        <p>Now, with a group of new Fishman canvases on view at Cheim and Read, a gallery in Chelsea, through Oct. 21, people can see for themselves how a thoughtful, self-critical artist is holding up the mantle of abstract painting in an era of familiar, sometimes tired postmodern polemics. The subject of the new paintings is the making of abstract paintings itself -- the methods an artist can use to create them and, ultimately, what they may mean and how they convey their meanings.</p>
        <p>''For me, making a painting is a very complicated process; often there's a lot of struggle,'' the artist said during a recent interview at her gallery.</p>
        <p>Dressed in work pants and a sweatshirt, Ms. Fishman cut a reedy figure standing before some of her largest new canvases; at times, expansive swaths of strong color slapped against their surfaces seemed to engulf her.</p>
        <p>''I may work on four or five pieces at a time, including little ones,'' she said. ''But I don't intentionally work in series. Many of these got started last year after I pulled out some paintings I had been working on but had put away, then took out and started scraping and reworking.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Fishman's laborious approach is well-known to her peers. In 1988, she made a trip to Eastern Europe, accompanied by a friend who was an artist, a collector and a survivor of Nazi death camps. The travelers visited the region's major capitals, as well as Auschwitz and Terezin. After returning to New York, Ms. Fishman produced a group of somber tableaus.</p>
        <p>Honoring Jewish themes of survival and remembrance in mood and title, they use unfussy, rectilinear arrangements of broad brushstrokes to whisper hauntingly for attention through nearly transparent washes of dark color. Subsequently, Ms. Fishman said, she found that her art ''loosened up'' -- but she worked at freeing up her touch, too.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fishman recalled: ''Gesture came up in the early 90's for me, but one reason I had difficulty using it was that I had a rigid understanding of what I wanted. I rely on my intuition, but what fuels my work is my intellectual side.'' Instead of ''letting the ease'' of more free-flowing, gestural painting ''become the brain of a work,'' she has tended to ''put a lot of things together and throw a lot of things out the window.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Fishman added: ''I think of myself as a perpetual student.''</p>
        <p>Her education began at home, for both her mother and an aunt were accomplished painters. Young Louise devoured the issues of Artnews her mother received by mail, poring over photo essays by Rudy Burckhardt that showed Abstract Expressionists like Joan Mitchell in the step-by-step process -- and considerable drama -- of making a painting. As a teenager, Ms. Fishman played basketball; then, in 1956, at the Philadelphia College of Art, she took up a brush. ''I fell in love with oil painting,'' she said. ''I just loved it. There's something about this that never ceases to interest me.''</p>
        <p>During the 1970's, Ms. Fishman became deeply involved in the feminist movement, and her work took a mixed-media turn toward the sculptural. It reflected the themes of handicrafts and ''women's work'' that feminist artists were reconsidering from a new aesthetic and political perspective. In time, though, she returned to oil painting.</p>
        <p>While some artists are known for bringing color theory prominently to their work, Ms. Fishman has been more fascinated by the physical qualities of oil paint's luminous, elastic goo. ''It's ground-up earth and rocks; it's earthy, plastic and metallic,'' she said, referring to its pigments. Only recently, she said, has she been able to regard standard cadmium red as something more than an industrially concocted, aspiring-color interloper on her own palette.</p>
        <p>Varieties of such bright hues, along with new elaborations of the darting, calligraphic strokes and ''now you see them, now you don't,'' underlying structural grids that have characterized her paintings in recent years turn up in the new works at Cheim and Read. In ''Razzmatazz,'' shots of pastel yellow poke through a cascade of black-gray strokes that almost obscure a middle layer of turquoise. A twister of broad, knotted gray strokes gathers gale force in the big, pink expanse of ''A Stranger,'' and in ''Sunrise Ruby,'' one of Ms. Fishman's largest new pictures, patches of mossy green hug its surface, at once in the field of color and seemingly afloat on a separate plane above it.</p>
        <p>Although she focuses intensely on her work, Ms. Fishman, who lives in and keeps a studio in Manhattan, routinely makes time to see museum and gallery shows. She is interested in contemporary video art and has a small collection of Chinese scholars' rocks. Lately she has steeped herself in Emily Dickinson's poetry and Emerson's essays. And then there's Pollock. Of the Abstract Expressionist giant's career-spanning exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art last year, Ms. Fishman said: ''I was willing to go everywhere with him to see what he kept uncovering about abstraction's emotional and psychological power.'' But even after four decades of creating abstract works herself, she holds no formulas for making an image say or mean anything in particular. A work's emotive force, she said, still emerges mysteriously.</p>
        <p>With a group of ambitious new paintings freshly behind her, Ms. Fishman appeared both enormously satisfied and a bit on edge. ''After a show, when I go back to work, I feel I'll never paint again,'' she said. anxiety in her voice. Then, resuming the role of her own strictest critic, she added: ''I'm not concerned about whether the next work will be good or not. I'm just concerned about making it -- that it'll be something really vital and fighting that makes me feel alive.''</p>
