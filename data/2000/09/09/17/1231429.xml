        <p>Striking public school teachers in Hamilton, N.J., reached a tentative settlement with the district's Board of Education early yesterday, after nearly two weeks of contentious salary disputes that have kept schools closed since Sept. 7.</p>
        <p>The two sides struck a deal at 6:30 a.m. after an all-night debate over the exact percentage of teacher pay raises over the next three years, said James Naples, vice president of the Hamilton Township Board of Education.</p>
        <p>School is expected to reopen tomorrow for the district's 13,000 students.</p>
        <p>''I would have to say that there's a general consensus that we're all happy that the kids are getting back to school on Monday,'' Mr. Naples said. ''Both sides reached an agreement that we felt was fair, and the whole process is over.''</p>
        <p>Officials of the 1,450-member Hamilton Township Education Association, the local teachers' union, could not be reached for comment last night.</p>
        <p>Negotiators on both sides agreed not to make public the exact terms of the settlement until it is presented to union members tomorrow for ratification, Mr. Naples said.</p>
        <p>The union is expected to approve the agreement, as is the Board of Education, which is scheduled to sign off on the settlement on Wednesday night, Mr. Naples said.</p>
        <p>The seeds for the settlement were planted during a ''productive'' negotiating session that began Thursday night and ended Friday morning, Mr. Naples said. Both sides wanted to meet again as soon as possible, and hopes were high as the negotiators reconvened at 4 p.m. on Friday. Going into that all-night session, the  board offered a 12.9 percent raise over three years, and the union demanded a 14.1 percent increase.</p>
        <p>Originally, the union had asked for a 15 percent increase over three years, while the board offered raises of 4 percent in the first year of the contract, 4.1 percent in the second year and 4.2 percent in the third year.</p>
        <p>''It got to the point where both sides had to give a little,'' Mr. Naples said, ''and we both reached that point where we felt it was a fair deal.''</p>
        <p>The strike, which began the day after Labor Day and forced school closings two days later, has spurred a flood of protests from parents and students in the primarily blue-collar suburb of Trenton, particularly from high school seniors worried about college admissions and delayed graduation. Mr. Naples said he received more than 500 telephone calls during the strike.</p>
        <p>But teachers contended that they were being shortchanged by the school board, saying they were the lowest-paid public school educators in Mercer County.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey Education Association, which backed the local union's strike, argued that teachers in Hamilton were starting at about $30,321 a year, then rising gradually to a maximum of $54,000 after 13 years. Meanwhile, the salaries of teachers in other Mercer County towns rise to as much as $89,000 a year.</p>
        <p>The teachers have been defying a court order issued last week that they return to work, and each could be fined $300 for each missed work day. The union could face a $100,000 per day fine. State Superior Court Judge Anthony J. Parillo, who ordered the fines, said Friday that the union could face additional sanctions.</p>
        <p>''That was a big source of our dilemma, the fact that we had a court order and then had to go back and impose fines because they were disobeying'' it, Mr. Naples said.</p>
        <p>The judge told both sides that the fines could not enter into the negotiation process. The Board of Education estimated on Friday that the fines amounted to more than $2 million.</p>
