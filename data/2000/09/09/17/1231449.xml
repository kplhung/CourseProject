        <p>In November it will be three years since Kathleen Caronna, an investment analyst, was injured when a six-story-tall balloon was swept out of control by strong winds at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Her lawyer says Mrs. Caronna has yet to recover from her injuries, and the lawsuit filed on her behalf is finally scheduled for trial, on Nov. 8.</p>
        <p>During the parade, the Cat in the Hat balloon struck the horizontal metal arm of a lamppost and rained debris on spectators, including Mrs. Caronna, then 33, who sustained a severe head injury. She was in a coma for 24 days, and underwent three months of rehabilitation before returning to the Manhattan apartment she shares with her husband and young son.</p>

        <p>In November it will be three years since Kathleen Caronna, an investment analyst, was injured when a six-story-tall balloon was swept out of control by strong winds at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Her lawyer says Mrs. Caronna has yet to recover from her injuries, and the lawsuit filed on her behalf is finally scheduled for trial, on Nov. 8.</p>
        <p>During the parade, the Cat in the Hat balloon struck the horizontal metal arm of a lamppost and rained debris on spectators, including Mrs. Caronna, then 33, who sustained a severe head injury. She was in a coma for 24 days, and underwent three months of rehabilitation before returning to the Manhattan apartment she shares with her husband and young son.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mrs. Caronna's lawyer filed a lawsuit seeking $95 million in compensatory damages from Macy's, New York City and the manufacturer of the lamppost, and an additional $300 million in punitive damages from Macy's. Judge Joan Madden of State Supreme Court in Manhattan is to hear the trial.</p>
        <p>Before the accident, her husband and friends said at the time, Mrs. Caronna was an effervescent, athletic go-getter who loved to travel and ski and boisterously play settemezzo, a Neapolitan card game, at the dinner parties she gave.</p>
        <p>But since her return home she has had continuing outpatient physical therapy. Although her condition did improve initially, she has reached a plateau where further progress has been achieved very slowly, said her lawyer, John Quinlan Kelly. She has been unable to return to her former job as a compliance analyst at the investment banking firm Schroder &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>A Macy's spokeswoman, Ronnie Taffet, declined to comment because litigation was pending.</p>
