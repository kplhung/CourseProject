        <p>FRANKEL-Lillian. With heartfelt sorrow we feel the loss of a sister, aunt and friend who filled our days with light, love and laughter. She will always be remembered. May she rest in peace. Carol, Peter, Dorothy, Bernice, Jori and Jon, Lani, Tara, Shane, Connor</p>
        <p>FRANKEL-Lillian. My heartfelt grief goes out to the Frankel family upon the loss of their beloved mother, Lillian. She was much more than a friend to me. I shall miss her dearly. Bern Meltzer</p>
        <p>FRANKEL-Lillie. A closeness and a love such as ours is very rare. You were not only my loving sister but my best friend. I will miss you terribly. Love, Dorothy</p>
