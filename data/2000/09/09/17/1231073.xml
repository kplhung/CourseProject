        <p>WHEN Denys Arcand stepped onto the red carpet outside Roy Thomson Hall here earlier this month, he had reached the end of a long road. His first major film in seven years, ''Stardom,'' was the opening-night offering at the Toronto International Film Festival, and Mr. Arcand, 59, a French-Canadian Montrealer, was enjoying a welcome reserved for native sons. Local newspapers had plastered photographs of Mr. Arcand and interviews with him all over their arts sections, heralding the film's arrival, and on the red carpet Mr. Arcand himself seemed to glow amid the adulation.</p>
        <p>But the premiere of ''Stardom,'' a film that tracks the fickle gaze of fame as it falls on a small-town girl (Jessica Pare) and transports her to the world of fashion modeling, signaled more than a jubilant return for the director. It put him even more firmly in the camp of prominent French-speaking directors who have turned to English for their films -- a sore point for some in a place where language is an emotional gauge of cultural health.</p>
        <p>Among these directors, Lea Pool, whose French-language film ''Emporte-Moi'' (''Set Me Free'') was a modest success in the United States last year, and the internationally known theater director Robert Lepage, whose play ''The Far Side of the Moon'' opened in New York earlier this month, are only two of the most conspicuous. Beyond them, a host of filmmakers seasoned by years of French production are entering the vast English-language market, lured by larger budgets and the promise of escape from the subtitle ghetto. For these directors, English production is a financial necessity. As the director Richard Roy put it in the French-language Montreal daily newspaper Le Devoir recently: ''I have projects in French, but I have to live.''</p>
        <p>But such a phenomenon doesn't sit well in Quebec, a province of roughly seven million people, 80 percent of whom are French-speaking. Fervently protective of its language and culture, the province is fond of referring to itself as a ''distinct society.'' Indeed, it has held two referendums in the last 25 years in which Quebecers were asked to vote on whether they wanted to separate from Canada. (They said no both times, but not by much: the most recent referendum, in 1995, failed by just a single percentage point.)</p>
        <p>The distinction, nonetheless, is clear: on both the big and small screens, an entire star system has evolved, unique to the province and entirely outside the North American mass-culture orbit. For some, the thought of Franco-Quebec filmmakers working outside this sphere reeks of betrayal -- particularly now, when Quebec, like most of the world, is facing an ever-larger influx of films from the Hollywood production machine.</p>
        <p>Odile Tremblay, the film critic for Le Devoir, wrote about the phenomenon recently, and the undertone of crisis was apparent: ''The danger is that we'll lose our best Francophone players in the ocean of the language of the other. There's also the danger of choosing English and sweeping our national realities under the carpet.''</p>
        <p>For Franco-Quebecers, the notion of national reality -- of a distinctive culture -- has been so closely tied to language that the two are almost inseparable, says Peter Wintonick, the Montreal documentary filmmaker who made ''Manufacturing Consent'' and, most recently, ''Cinema Verite.''</p>
        <p>''Language certainly is the touchstone,'' Mr. Wintonick says. ''There's disappearing species, flora and fauna, but the disappearance of language is a major crisis. There is this struggle, for people whose culture is identified with language, to preserve it. It's really sort of sad, because cinema is really an expression of your culture, and in this case, the language is such a large part of the culture.''</p>
        <p>For Ms. Tremblay, the struggle is palpable: ''We have a small film community. We are a small society. So there is always a fear. There will always be French films in Quebec. But if all the important filmmakers turn to English, the loss will be there.''</p>
        <p>That sense of loss is rooted deep in the province's cinematic history. Through the 1960's and 70's, the National Film Board of Canada was based in Montreal, and its presence generated an entire generation of documentary filmmakers, among them Claude Jutra, who directed ''Mon Oncle Antoine'' (1971), still considered one of the finest Canadian films ever produced. From the documentary tradition sprang a method of narrative filmmaking that echoed the cinema verite movement in France; it came to be known in Quebec as ''Le Direct'' -- a sincere, often bleak portrait of Quebecois daily life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arcand, too, is a member of this school, his skills honed on documentaries at the film board in the late 60's. He went on to establish himself as an auteur -- a visionary director who could draw an international audience by virtue of his name alone -- with French-language films like ''The Decline of the American Empire'' (1987) and ''Jesus of Montreal''(1989), both of which received Academy Award nominations for best foreign film. But even now, he says, his filmmaking owes a debt to those formative years. For ''Stardom,'' which opens in New York on Oct. 27, Mr. Arcand spent years interviewing former models, photographers and stylists, passing hours backstage at fashion shows, recording every detail: ''I just amassed tons and tons of documents and information before beginning, which is the way a documentary filmmaker works. And I've kept that. All my films are done like that, are part of that tradition, in a sense. That's where I come from.''</p>
        <p>And yet, through his 30-year career, Mr. Arcand has moved on from the priorities that shaped his early work, priorities that were, in the early years, necessarily focused on French-speaking Quebec. Even for films like ''The Decline and Fall of the American Empire'' and ''Jesus of Montreal'' -- both in French -- the language was incidental, in service of broader themes. '' 'Decline' could have taken place anywhere -- it was a universal subject,'' he says of the film, which examined the dynamics of marriage and infidelity among four couples in Quebec. ''The same is true of 'Jesus' -- or 'Stardom.' It's a very personal film, like all my films. It's not a Quebecois film anymore. It's a film by me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arcand's statement speaks of ambition and aspiration, qualities both essential and expected in an artist pursuing international success. But what is a natural yearning for most can easily be politicized for a talented Franco-Quebec artist. When Mr. Arcand made his first English-language film, ''Love and Human Remains'' (1993), he had no political motive; he was simply drawn to a play about sexual frustration and failed ambitions wrapped around a murder mystery by Brad Fraser, an English-Canadian playwright. And yet at the time he was roundly criticized in the French-language press for it. Even before the film's releas, Ms. Tremblay, writing in Le Devoir, was looking for weaknesses: '' 'Love and Human Remains' doesn't correspond to our Quebecois sensibilities,'' she wrote. ''Some accuse Arcand of having adopted American methods by calling on focus groups and betraying the cause of auteur filmmaking by flirting with producer-driven cinema.''</p>
        <p>Loyalty and betrayal are common themes among Quebecois filmmakers whose priorities lie on different sides of the debate. Pierre Falardeau, a Montreal director known for his politically charged work, makes no secret of his allegiance. ''When you're an artist, you have a responsibility,'' he says. ''The reason I make films is this: when I was young, the only films I saw were John Wayne movies, and stupid Elvis Presley films. And when I was 17, 18, I discovered that there were guys on the screen dressed like my father, who spoke like my father, or my neighbors. And I realized film does not have to be stupid. It can say something about our culture.''</p>
        <p>The culture Mr. Falardeau refers to is unmistakably Quebec's. He speaks fondly of early Quebecois directors like Pierre Perrault, who made films about daily life among the French-speaking residents in the province's eastern regions. And his own films crystallize his priorities: ''Octobre'' centers on the October crisis of 1974, in which the Quebec politician Pierre Laporte was kidnapped and murdered by members of the radical separatist group the Front de Liberation de Quebec. His next film, set for release early next year, is called ''15 Fevrier 1839,'' the date that a revolution by the French failed in English-speaking Lower Canada.</p>
        <p>Mr. Falardeau's position is hardly a new one. In the 70's, Mr. Jutra, a devout separatist, deliberately skirted political issues in his work, and suffered criticism for it. When ''Mon Oncle Antoine'' became a success outside of Quebec, some rejected it as a non-Quebecois film. ''He was often accused by the more ideological separatists of betraying the cause because he didn't make films about the issue,'' said Jim Leach, who recently published a biography of Mr. Jutra. ''It's something like Spike Lee working in Hollywood. You're not just Spike Lee making a film, you're representing the black community.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lepage, whose ''Possible Worlds'' had its debut at the Venice Film Festival before screening in Toronto, says, ''That pressure, both then and now, is the product of the insecurity of a young culture, but one that Quebec is slowly outgrowing.</p>
        <p>''I know Denys Arcand very well, and I know that, for a while, he felt that there was a bit of animosity in Quebec because he started doing things in English a few years ago. And I said 'No, Denys, that's a false debate now.' '' He adds, ''I think Quebec is ready to be like other countries that still try to conserve their culture, but recognize that the market is in English.''</p>
        <p>For Ms. Pool, a 50-year-old director who came to Quebec from Switzerland 25 years ago, the liberation of which Mr. Lepage speaks has been a long time coming. Having made films in French throughout her career, she has just completed her first English film, ''Lost and Delirious,'' starring Piper Perabo and Ms. Pare as boarding school girls on the verge of discovering their sexuality. And she is betraying no one, she says -- most important, herself: ''The idea that, if you speak in English, and you make a film in English, you're a different person -- that's completely stupid. I'm sure they will be looking a little closer at me, to see if I have not sold my soul to Hollywood. But the reason I made this film was that it was very close to me, to what I do. Of course, I knew that if we made the film in English, it would be easier to get the money. I knew it was easier to find name actresses. But when I was asked why I made this film in English, it was because I didn't want to translate it into French. That's the main, main reason. It's a screenplay by an American playwright, Judith Thompson, based on a novel by an American author -- Susan Swan's 'Wives of Bath.' What else would I do?''</p>
        <p>MS. POOL recalls when one of her films was refused by a Quebec film festival because it was deemed to be ''not Quebecois.''  ''I made all my films here, so what is a Quebec film?'' she asks, incredulous. ''What is the parallel between Pierre Falardeau's films and Denys Arcand's films? They cannot be compared. They're completely different.''</p>
        <p>All the same, Quebec may be warming to a more international perspective. Mr. Lepage recalls the inaugural Jutra Awards (named for the director) last year -- the Jutras are Quebec's own film awards, a sort of provincial Oscars -- and the big winner was ''The Red Violin,'' an English-language film directed by the Montreal filmmaker Francois Girard, but starring Samuel L. Jackson and a host of Anglo-Canadians.</p>
        <p>Laughing, Mr. Lepage says: ''Suddenly we had all these English-Canadian actors accepting all these prizes, and speaking their broken French, saying 'Thank you,' and feeling very uneasy, because they're in the French Quebec bastion that is deciding to give them some credit. That started a bit of a buzz at that moment, and I think that Quebec will learn as it gets more productive in its film industry that it is an industry where a lot of creators will want to exploit larger markets -- not just subtitles.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Roger Frappier, who produced ''Jesus of Montreal'' and now runs his own production company, Max Films, believes a new generation of Quebecois filmmakers is blossoming, for whom language is secondary to the film itself.</p>
        <p>''I think that we cannot listen to the word 'globalization' for years and years without its having an effect on the minds of young people,'' says Mr. Frappier. He points to Denis Villeneuve, one of his young directors, as an example. Mr. Ville neuve's new film, ''Maelstrom,'' a stylistic experiment narrated by a fish, had its premiere at the Toronto Film Festival, and, says Mr. Frappier: '' 'Maelstrom' has nothing to do with Quebec and everything to do with Quebec. It's a new form of cinematography that has no boundaries.''</p>
        <p>For some, the films made in Mr. Frappier's stable are ideal: an expression of Quebecois culture that does not rely on language. ''When Lars von Trier makes a film in English, he is doing a film only he can do,'' Mr. Frappier says. ''He has roots. And that's what we should never lose when we make a film, even if it's in English, or has universal appeal: that it comes from here, and it has a specific vision.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Lepage, reaching that point is a simple question of confidence: ''The only thing that really shakes the basis of Quebec's assurance in its identity is the fact that it's a very, very young society. Our writers, our filmmakers, our theater people are all alive. They're young, somebody like Michel Tremblay, who's probably our equivalent of Shakespeare, or Schiller, or Horst Strindberg -- you can call him on the phone and talk to him.''</p>
        <p>''But I feel very strong,'' he went on, ''because I've toured the world many times and I could sense how Quebec culture has its place, whether it's translated into English or not. It has a mark, it's very strong, it's very specifically Quebecois. So am I nervous about this? Not as nervous as others might be.''</p>
