        <p>A city of faded grandeur, Turin has a reputation for stodginess, which is not helped by the fact that it is best known as the home of a major automaker, Fiat. This autumn, however, with the Shroud of Turin on display as part of the Roman Catholic Holy Year, Turin is trying to change that image by opening some of its long hidden charms for the first time,  making the fall an excellent time for a visit.</p>
        <p>After Fiat, Turin is best known for the shroud, which is seldom on view. Believed by many to be the burial cloth of Christ, it alone is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors to the northern Italian city.</p>
        <p>But the shroud is not all Turin has to offer. Before it became home to the Agnelli princes of industry, it was the home of the House of Savoy, the royal dynasty founded in the 11th century that long ruled over its small kingdom, and then ruled Italy from its unification in 1861 until the end of World War II. The family's 17th-century Royal Palace reigns over the Piazza Castello, the heart of the old city. Shroud visitors will file through the lavish royal gardens on their way to the 15th-century Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista, where the relic, carefully restored two years ago, is hung.</p>
        <p>Turin is rich in churches and palaces, some of which are among those at last being opened to the public. There are first-rate museums, elegant turn-of-the-century columned arcades and excellent shops. The city also has the new and unusual interactive National Museum of Cinema that clashes pleasantly with Turin's old-world charm. Nor should one overlook the fact that Turin, nestled in the province of Piedmont, has excellent restaurants with reasonable prices.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>The Shroud of Turin will be on view through Oct. 22 at the Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista, only the fifth time the holy relic has been displayed in the past 100 years. Reservations are mandatory, but tickets are free and can be made either by telephone at (39) 011 511 8900 or on the Web at www.sindone.org.</p>
        <p>After Oct. 22, the shroud will no longer be displayed, but visitors to Turin will still be able to see a few sites associated with it. Among them are the Museum of the Shroud in the crypt of the baroque Church of the Santissimo Sudario, and the 17th-century Church of San Lorenzo, where the shroud had its first permanent home after it arrived in Turin in the 16th century.</p>
        <p>About 100 paintings by Paul Klee, from his more colorful and whimsical period, will be exhibited at the Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea at Via Magenta 31, (39) 011 562 9911, from Oct. 26 through Jan. 31. Admission is $4.60, at 2,170 lire to the dollar.</p>
        <p>An exhibition on the Queen of Sheba and the art of Yemen runs from Sept. 26 through Jan. 7 at the Palazzo Bricherasio, Via Lagrange 20, (39) 011 517 1660. Admission $5.50.</p>
        <p>From Oct. 28 through Jan. 7 contemporary Italian artists will brighten city nights with luminous works of art in piazzas and streets as part of Artist Lights in Turin.</p>
        <p>The Settembre Musica festival, which runs through Sept. 25, has been an autumn highlight since 1978. There are two concerts a day, free in the afternoon and from $11.50 to $30 in the evening, in places like the Teatro Regio, some of the city's churches and the Auditorium del Lingotto. The music of Igor Stravinsky, the contemporary Italian composers Luigi Nono and Luciano Berio, and pieces by the Himalayas, a group of musicians and dancers from Tibet, Nepal and Kashmir, are being featured. For information, (39) 011 442 4777 or www.comune.torino.it/ settembremusica/.</p>
        <p>From Oct. 25 to 29, Turin rules over the culinary unification of Italy. The Salone del Gusto, a market fair featuring the best Italian wines and food, allows visitors to sample hundreds of different kinds of cheese, cured meat, balsamic vinegar and wine at the Lingotto Fiere, Via Nizza 280. The schedule includes meals by leading chefs. Admission is $14 a day or $41.50 for all five days. Information: www.slowfood.it or from Slow Food Arcigola, Via Mendicita Istruita 14, 12024 Bra (CN); telephone (39) 011 9172 419611.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>The Royal Palace of Turin is a popular stop because of its royal apartments. Through Oct. 29, another palace, the baroque, jewel-like  Castello del Valentino, generally not open to the public, can be visited on Saturday mornings; reservations are required.</p>
        <p>Built from 1633 to 1638 on the banks of the River Po by Carlo Emanuele I, it was meant to indulge his somewhat petulant daughter-in-law, Marie-Christine of France, who among other things demanded a French-style slate roof, rarely found in Piedmont. The Castello, now a university with some rooms used as offices, sits in the 1.2-acre Parco del Valentino, one of Turin's largest parks.</p>
        <p>The Villa Della Regina and its 17th-century garden, across the Po from the Parco del Valentino, is another historic site being opened on Saturday mornings during the period of the shroud's display. Some of the palace's opulent halls as well as its garden can be seen.</p>
        <p>To book at both palaces, call (39) 011 817 7178; tours are in Italian and are limited to 20 people. For a historic place that requires no booking and places no limit on group size, visit the 18th-century Church of Santa Chiara (Wednesday afternoons), noted for its architecture that allows plays of light inside; or the Church of Santa Cristina (Friday afternoons), with its richly stuccoed ceiling.</p>
        <p>During the shroud exhibition, Turin's Egyptian Museum is taking only advance bookings, and its reservation system at www.multix.it/ museoegizio_to/ is so confusing that it might be wise to skip it. But those who persevere will be rewarded with many treasures, including a complete set of funerary objects from the tomb of the architect Kha and his wife Merit (1450 B.C.), the Rock Temple of Thutmose III (circa 1450 B.C.) from Ellessya, and a remarkable collection of papyrus. Many exhibits are poorly displayed, and the service is distinctly unhelpful. Visitors may be better off going to the Galleria Sabauda in the same building, where the impressive collection of paintings includes works by Veronese, Bronzino, Pollaiuolo and Filippino Lippi, as well as Poussin, Rembrandt and Roger Van der Weyden. Both museum and gallery are open 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. daily except Mondays. Admission: $5.50 museum, $3.50 gallery, $7 for both.</p>
        <p>The imaginative National Museum of Cinema is housed in the Mole Antonelliana, a bizarre 19th-century ''skyscraper,'' commissioned in 1863 as a synagogue, which has stood mostly empty for generations. The Swiss architect Francois Confino has transformed it into a museum that is at heart a theme park and features movie arcana from painted 18th-century Venetian magic lanterns to original scripts of ''The Godfather'' and ''Citizen Kane'' to Fellini's hat and scarf. Themed screening rooms off the main hall show continuous movie clips. The Horror Room is decorated in high Gothic, and the Room of the Absurd shows clips of Bunuel and Monty Python as the audience sits on mock toilet seats. A glass-walled elevator rises to an observation platform with a majestic view of the Alps. Open 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily except Mondays, Saturdays until 11. Admission: $3.50, free under 10.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>Perhaps the best bargain in town is the Victoria, Via Nino Costa 4, (39) 011 561 1909, fax (39) 011 561 1806.The 98 rooms are comfortable and pretty, and there is a small, delightful garden just off the area where breakfast is served. Doubles from $115 to $129.</p>
        <p>Dogana Vecchia, Via Corte Dappello 4, (39) 011 4366752, fax (39) 011436 7194, housed in a late-18th century palace, is charming and a little funky. Many of the 70-odd rooms have faux baroque furniture, and there are a cozy breakfast room and a wood-paneled hall that make you feel as though you had stepped back in history 100 years. The owners' cordiality and enthusiasm are infectious. Doubles $102 to $115.</p>
        <p>Budget: The Astoria in Via XX Settembre 4, (39) 011 562 0653, fax (39) 011 562 5866, is close to the main railway station. While the building dates to the 1800's and the reception area has retained that old-world charm, the rooms are modern, with satellite TV and other amenities. There is a quiet little garden inside. Doubles $83 to $100.</p>
        <p>Luxury: The Turin Palace Hotel, Via Sacchi 8, (39) 011 562 5511, fax (39) 011 561 2187 has been one of Turin's most elegant hotels since it opened in 1872, playing host to such  guests as the Empress Elizabeth, wife of Franz Joseph, who would have felt much at home in the Louis XV-style reception hall and rooms. The hotel is conveniently situated across the street from the Porta Nuova station. The 125 rooms are luxuriously decorated. Doubles are $208.</p>
        <p>Just off the Via Roma, Turin's main shopping street, lined with arcades and chic shops, is the Jolly Hotel Principi di Piemonte, Via Gobetti 15, (39) 011 562 9693, fax (39) 011 562 0270. The 107 rooms are spacious and still furnished with the hotel's exquisite 1930's pieces. The color schemes change floor by floor, alternating green, pink and light blue. Mosaics in the reception hall are made of Murano glass. Doubles range from $180 to $207.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Two of the city's more opulent cafes are the Caffe San Carlo, opened in 1822, and the Caffe Torino, opened in 1903, where writers and intellectuals have always been regular guests. Both are in the central Piazza San Carlo, and a fin de siecle atmosphere still pervades both. Either is a requisite stop for an aperitif, a Turin tradition (vermouth was invented there in 1786), and the cafes also serve full meals. The coffee at the San Carlo, its own blend, is worth a return trip after dinner.</p>
        <p>Turin lays claim to the famous Giandujotti chocolates, and its pastry shops are unforgettable. The Al Bicerin Caffe, Piazza della Consolata 5, (39) 011 436 9325, has been serving its coffee with chocolate and whipped cream practically since it opened in 1763. Cozy with wood-paneled walls and wooden floor, the cafe has eight marble-topped tables and the original 18th-century counter.</p>
        <p>Next door is Il Bacaro Pane e Vino, Piazza della Consolata 3, (39) 011436 9064, a small wine bar that offers tastings and serves sandwiches and full meals in an Art Deco setting with soft lighting. The menu changes frequently and features Venetian dishes such as whipped dry cod, or innovative pasta such as spinach-cheese gnocchi. Dinner for two with wine runs $55.</p>
        <p>Since opening three years ago, the elegant Vintage 1997, Piazza Solferino 16, (39) 011 535948, has become one of city's most popular restaurants. The fish tasting menu starts with appetizers like capesante au gratin with leeks and parmigiano sorbet; it continues with warm oysters with spring onions, stuffed calimari with pesto, ravioli stuffed with monkfish and a tuna chateaubriand. There is also a Piemontese tasting menu that is meat-based. The exquisite desserts include chocolate flan with white-chocolate ice cream and rum sauce. Dinner for two with wine starts at $46.</p>
        <p>More traditional Piedmont meals are served at Al 24, Via Montebello 24, (39) 011 812 2981, near the Museum of Cinema. Pasta dishes, such as the tagliolini with porcini mushrooms and cherry tomatoes, make good use of the succulent mushrooms that grow wild in Piedmont. Meal for two with wine: $60.</p>
