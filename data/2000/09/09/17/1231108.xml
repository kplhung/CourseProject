        <p>FACED with what they call  minimal efforts by the county to recruit minority police officers, Servando Rodriguez Jr., Luis Muniz and Frank Alfonso, members of the Westchester Hispanic Law Enforcement Association, spent last Saturday recruiting for a Dec. 9 civil service examination on their own.</p>
        <p>Standing on Broadway in downtown Yonkers, the three officers handed out pamphlets and talked to passers-by about changing the system from the inside.</p>
        <p>''Police aren't recruiting minorities for the test,'' said Mr. Rodriguez, a 30-year old police officer in Scarsdale. ''Their idea of recruitment is putting up a poster. They're waiting for the mountain to come to Muhammad.''</p>
        <p>The association, which draws its 200 members from the police, the Department of Corrections and the F.B.I., is handing out material at colleges as well in an effort to increase Hispanic registration for the  exam, which is required of prospective officers in almost all Westchester towns.</p>
        <p>The effort has had some success, said Piero Olcese, the association's vice president, observing that last year 380 Hispanics took the test in Yonkers, triple the turnout for the previous test. The organization plans to put together a tutorial for the test to help those who pass find jobs in one of Westchester's 42 police departments.</p>
        <p>''The response has been overwhelming,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''We've given out a couple hundred applications, and we've only been here two hours.''</p>
        <p>The officers are trying to overcome what they say is a traditional fear of the police in minority communities.</p>
        <p>''In their country, if they look a cop in the face they get beat up,'' said Mr. Alfonso, a 39-year-old corrections officer who works with juvenile offenders.</p>
        <p>Paula Redd Zeman, the county's commissioner of human resources, praised the association's efforts.</p>
        <p>While the county has printed fliers and posters and mailed information about the exam to minority organizations and universities, she said, the association has done ''a Trojan's job to get the word out about the exam.''</p>
        <p>''The average Joe on the street doesn't know how you become a police officer,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Still, she predicted that turnout would be poor for all civil service examinations this year because of the strong economy and the lack of publicity.</p>
        <p>A report issued last year by the state's Department of Criminal Justice Services said that of 2,633 police officers in the county, only 121, or 4.6 percent, were Hispanic. The 1990 census put Westchester's Hispanic population at 9.9 percent of the total, with large increases projected.</p>
        <p>The association's most immediate concern is preparing applicants for the test.</p>
        <p>To pass, applicants must score 70 out of 100 on the exam, which consists mainly of reading comprehension. An extra section, which is optional, tests proficiency in Spanish. The problem, the officers say, is that applicants must register for either the regular test or the test and the extra section, and that those who pass are put on separate lists.</p>
        <p>''In the last 12 months the hiring from that list was nonexistent,'' Mr. Olcese said. ''If they pass the test they should be on both lists.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez added, ''You're actually penalized for knowing a second language.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Zeman admitted that ''a lot of times the departments do not select people from the Spanish-speaking list,' but she said it was not a disadvantage to be listed there. ''It's not a handicap.''</p>
        <p>The officers also complain that scoring well on the test does not insure being offered a job.</p>
        <p>The ''one in three'' rule, which requires that departments hire from the top three scorers on the list ''puts you into competition with at least two other guys who are in the good old boys' club,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''Time after time you'll lose out.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Zeman attributed that to high test scores.</p>
        <p>''Very often we won't get past the 90 mark in making appointments in a four-year span,'' she said. She observed that ''many departments are far more willing to consider diversifying their forces, but many more need to follow suit.''</p>
        <p>One passer-by, Gardiner Paige, who grew up in Yonkers and works as a child-care supervisor, said he had taken the civil service test five times but was never hired as an officer, and he asked the association members, ''Where were you when they wouldn't hire black people?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alfonso replied that the only way to change the system was by being a part of it. ''I agree with you, you should be angry,'' he added.</p>
