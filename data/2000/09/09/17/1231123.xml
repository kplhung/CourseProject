        <p>ART and music are finding their way to one another in museums. Many of the state's museums are discovering that the people who walk through their doors are more sophisticated than ever and exhibition-driven musical events sell out repeatedly, indicating a hunger for knowledge and a challenged intellect.</p>
        <p>The art concert is a comprehensive, meticulously researched event that has been blessed by a music committee, education directors and the curators themselves. While many museums and art institutions have offered performances by chamber music groups and soloists in addition to the exhibitions, as well as films and lectures that pertain to them, rarely has the music been programmed and developed with the art's aesthetic in mind.</p>

        <p>ART and music are finding their way to one another in museums. Many of the state's museums are discovering that the people who walk through their doors are more sophisticated than ever and exhibition-driven musical events sell out repeatedly, indicating a hunger for knowledge and a challenged intellect.</p>
        <p>The art concert is a comprehensive, meticulously researched event that has been blessed by a music committee, education directors and the curators themselves. While many museums and art institutions have offered performances by chamber music groups and soloists in addition to the exhibitions, as well as films and lectures that pertain to them, rarely has the music been programmed and developed with the art's aesthetic in mind.</p>
        <p>Museumgoers now have the opportunity to attend a concert to hear music that, for example, the artist might have heard. If the show encompasses an era or school of painting, the concert program will reflect the historic scope. Whatever the exhibition's theme, there is music to match it. And if there is none, museums are comfortable commissioning new works. Many of the concerts are free and, in some cases where space allows, the music is performed in the gallery itself.</p>
        <p>And sometimes there is a perfect match. The Norwalk-based American Classical Orchestra has become the first period-instrument ensemble to complement an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''Art and the Empire City: New York, 1825-1861'' opens on Tuesday and runs through Jan 7. The orchestra's music director, Thomas Crawford, said he heard about plans for the exhibition two years ago and decided to contact the museum because, in his words, ''the 19th century is our bailiwick.'' After six months of not having his phone calls returned, he said, he just went to the museum, which asked for a proposal. Mr. Crawford said he did a lot of research and ''stumbled on these two masterpieces that were premiered in New York.'' The two pieces -- ''The Christmas Bells,'' by Charles Edward Horn, and ''A Christmas Symphony,'' by William Henry Fry -- as well as Mendelssohn's ''Von Himmel Hoch'' will be on the orchestra's concert program on Dec. 10 in the American Wing at the Met.</p>
        <p>Horn (a founder of the New York Philharmonic) and Fry were prominent New York musicians in the second quarter of the 19th century, Mr. Crawford explained, and Mendelssohn was so popular in New York that 10,000 people are said to have attended his memorial concert.</p>
        <p>Lisa Doyle, associate manager for concerts and lectures at the Met described the experience this way: ''It's a natural because you are totally immersed in the culture of the time,'' she said. Concertgoers will sit in the historic American Wing, hear music of the second quarter of the 19th century, performed on 19th-century instruments played in the style of the 19th century.</p>
        <p>The focus shifts to a different aspect of 19th-century culture on Oct. 5 at the Wadsworth Atheneum where ''The Impressionists at Argenteuil'' (which runs through Dec. 3) is the backdrop for a session of the Hartford museum's First Thursday series. A celebration of French culture will include music by the Impressionist Trio, musicians from the Hartford Symphony Orchestra.</p>
        <p>The Yale Center for British Art in New Haven has its own art-cum-music planned. Kay deSanctis, programs coordinator for the past six years, said she strived to put exhibition and concertgoers in the same context as those who viewed the art when it was new. ''It gives a sense of the period, the times,'' she said.</p>
        <p>This season the Yale center opens with ''Edward Lear and the Art of Travel,'' running from Wednesday through Jan. 14. Lear (1812-1888), one of the great artist-travelers of the Victorian Age and author of ''The Owl and the Pussycat,'' documented a lifetime of journeys throughout the Mediterranean and India.</p>
        <p>Ms. deSanctis said she told Tobe Malawista, a soprano in Mirror Visions Ensemble, that the center was looking for music that British travlers might have heard when they went to Italy or India or Egypt. The result is a concert entitled ''A Musical Journey in the Footsteps of Edward Lear'' that will be held on Oct. 15 at 2 p.m. The baritone Richard Lalli, who will also play the piano, will be joined by the baritone Scott Murphree. The program features songs and duets from England, France, Italy, Greece, Russia and India. New settings of the words of Lear will be performed by William Ryden, Betty Roe, Richard Pearson Thomas and Mr. Lalli. The program will also feature Lear's own musical setting of the words of Alfred Lord Tennyson.</p>
        <p>In conjunction with the Yale center's exhibition ''The School of London and Their Friends: The Collection of Elaine and Melvin Merians,'' which opens Oct. 11 and runs through Jan. 7, Ms. deSanctis has engaged the Auros Group for New Music. In November, the ensemble will present a program highlighting the innovators and followers of British contemporary music (such as Birtwistle, Turnage and Ades) to parallel the exhibition, which traces the school from its beginnings in 1940 up to the present.</p>
        <p>Somehow, when contemporary music is coupled with art, people are more receptive.</p>
        <p>''It works,'' said Robin Garr, curator of education and public programs at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich. ''It allows us to present music that's not in the mainstream.'' In the past the Bruce has commissioned a new composition to augment a show on surrealism. Opening on Oct. 1 (and running through the end of the year) is ''The American Avant-Garde: A Decade of Change 1936-1946.'' The companion concert, entitled ''Music of the Avant-Garde'' will be presented on Nov. 4 at 8 p.m. It will focus on innovative works of the period, such as early electronic music, Ms. Garr said.</p>
        <p>The Bruce Museum concerts are held in its lecture hall, but during intermission the audience is encouraged to wander through the galleries.</p>
        <p>Some of the museum concert offerings are free, but reservations are still recommended. If seating is open, plan to arrive early.</p>
        <p>Two concerts by the American Classical Orchestra can be heard at the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART (Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, Manhattan; 212-535-7710) on Dec. 10 at 6:30 and 8:30 p.m. Single tickets are $50 (seating first come, first served). The same program will be given at the Norwalk Concert Hall (125 East Avenue, Norwalk) on Dec. 9 at 8 p.m. where tickets are $18 to $50 (reserved seating, 203-838-6995).</p>
        <p>On Nov. 4 at 8 p.m. at the BRUCE MUSEUM (One Museum Drive, Greenwich; 203-869-0376), ''Music of the Avant-Garde'' will feature the Pierrot Consort. On May 12 at 8 p.m., ''20th-Century Russian Music'' will feature the pianist Gabrielius Alenka. Tickets are $10 for museum members, $15 for non-members.</p>
        <p>The number to call for tickets to the ''Impressionists at Argenteuil'' at the WADSWORTH ATHENEUM (600 Main Street, Hartford) is 877-600-6246. Admission to the concert by the Impressionist Trio on Oct. 5 from 5 to 8 p.m. is free.</p>
        <p>''Mazurka: A Parallel Portrait of Frederic Chopin and August Franchomme'' will be presented at the Atheneum by Chamber Music Plus on Oct. 28 at 7:30 p.m. with a pre-concert talk at 6:45 p.m. and Oct. 29 at 2 p.m., pre-concert talk at 1:15 p.m. Tickets are $25.</p>
        <p>At the YALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART (1080 Chapel Street, New Haven; 203-432-2800), ''A Musical Journey in the Footsteps of Edward Lear'' with the Mirror Visions Ensemble can be heard on Oct. 15 at 2 p.m. On Oct. 22, at 2 p.m., the center will present members of the New Haven Symphony Orchestra in compositions by Elgar, Mozart and Saint-Saens interpreting artworks by George Stubbs and others in a family-oriented event in the galleries. On Nov. 12 at 2 p.m., the Auros Group for New Music will perform. Admission to the events are free.</p>
