        <p>Reader's Digest is not known for its racy articles, but it did become the subject of an edgy item in the tabloid gossip pages last week.

        <p>Donna Pierpont, a Reader's Digest spokeswoman, said Ms. Romano's background ''has no bearing'' on the direction of the magazine and would cause ''no change at all'' in its editorial direction.</p>
        <p>''We don't often find ourself in controversy,'' she added, ''but it does happen once in a while, and I'm not so sure that's bad.''</p>
