      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>After five years working as a software engineer in Boston, Jennifer Brissett moved to Brooklyn and opened Indigo Cafe and Books, which she describes as ''an independent general bookstore with an Africana influence.''</p>
        <p>At 672 Fulton Street (near South Elliot Place) in Fort Greene, Ms. Brissett offers 1,600 titles, new and used. She specializes in African authors as well as authors of the African diaspora. You can find ''Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction From the African Diaspora,'' an anthology edited by Sheree Thomas. But Ms. Brissett is also sure to include the Harry Potter stories on her shelves. She said she was focusing on people in their 20's or 30's, some of whom have small children.</p>

        <p>The store space, with 14-foot high ceilings, tall windows and exposed brick, was decorated with furnishings that were upholstered by hand with indigo cloth in Ghana. The cafe serves Jamaican chicken or vegetable patties and Caribbean soda in flavors like mango and kiwi. A Web site is operated at www.indigo-cafe.com.</p>
        <p>What about competition from chains? ''I don't think they've really found our community yet,'' Ms. Brissett said. ''I'm not really worried about Barnes &amp; Noble and Amazon.com and places like that.'' She added, ''The presence of those bookstores allows me to be small.''</p>
