        <p>IN the 1950's and 60's, a gathering in New Britain of young toughs meant a drag race or rumble. Now in their 50's and 60's, these aging rebels have a new cause: a picnic reunion.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of members of former street gangs, including the Earls, the Lords, the Reebs and the Little Cobras, plan to gather at the town's V.F.W. picnic grounds Saturday to eat, arm wrestle, settle (or maybe just discuss) old scores and show off grandchildren.</p>
        <p>''Our motto is 'Leave your chains, bring your canes,' '' said Gary Chute, the organizer of the event, who hopes as many as 400 people will attend. ''We've had calls from Pennsylvania, Florida, California, New Jersey, New York. They called and said, 'We're coming in.' ''</p>
        <p>The event is open to the public, but Mr. Chute is most eager to draw anyone who belonged to these groups while attending New Britain High School nearly a half-century ago. Like many former members of these once-menacing bands, Mr. Chute, 53, now walks haltingly, with the aid of a knee brace. A longtime New Britain detective retired on disability, he fondly recalls the days when he walked on the other side of the law as a member of T.K. (short for Tap-a-Keg, one of the group's favorite pastimes).</p>
        <p>''We weren't known as gangs back then,'' Mr. Chute said. ''We were clubs. We weren't really gangsters.''</p>
        <p>But that doesn't mean they were choirboys. ''We weren't candy salesmen, let's put it that way,'' Mr. Chute said. ''We had some of the toughest guys there were.</p>
        <p>''One guy would look at another the wrong way and then they'd go back to their club, and the next thing you know, we'd be rumbling,'' Mr. Chute continued. ''A lot of times, it was over a girl.</p>
        <p>''We were like 'West Side Story,' except we didn't sing that much.''</p>
        <p>Some confrontations involved more than 100 youngsters. Particularly memorable was a big showdown between T.K. and the Lords in 1962, on the corner of Lafayette and Washington Streets. ''Big rumble. Front page of The New Britain Herald,'' Mr. Chute said. ''I remember coming home that night, and my dad said, 'Hear about the fight?' And I said, 'What fight?' ''</p>
        <p>Of course, he had been there. So had George Sahadi, a former Lord. ''I was arrested twice for fighting,'' said Mr. Sahadi, another retired New Britain detective. The first time, the charge was thrown out of court, he said. The second occurred in the spring of his senior year in high school. The judge gave him a choice of spending 30 days in jail or being drafted. ''So I graduated high school, and two days later I went into the Army.''</p>
        <p>Conflicts were typically turf wars between local groups defending their own corners on Main Street, where they hung out to show off their muscles, menacing looks and D.A. haircuts. ''We were always arguing and  fighting at that time,'' Mr. Sahadi said. But these skirmishes involved few weapons of any kind, he said. ''In our day, we only fought with fists, and when we fought the next day we were friends.''</p>
        <p>Combatant clubs could become instant allies when faced with out-of-town rivals. ''We had our fights against each other,'' Mr. Chute said, ''and in the summertime we'd all end up down at the beach, in Saybrook or Old Lyme, and we'd stick together and hold our turf against other clubs from New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.''</p>
        <p>Some club members would sleep on the beach. Others would chip in to rent cottages by the shore because that's where the girls they knew went. ''You had to go see the girls,'' said Joseph Murphy, a former member of Theta Sigma who now lives in Wolcott. ''That was a very important part of high school.''</p>
        <p>Most of the members were teenagers at New Britain High or local trade schools.</p>
        <p>''Then, of course,'' Mr. Chute said, ''Vietnam broke out, and a lot of guys went to Nam or into the service. And that's when most of the clubs broke up.''</p>
        <p>Not all of the groups disbanded, however. ''A couple of the clubs, the Lords and the Earls, remained, and they changed their ethics,'' Mr. Chute said, ''if you want to put it that way.'' By the late '80s, these groups had been replaced by the Latin Kings and Los Solidos, violent gangs known for drive-by shootings and selling drugs.</p>
        <p>''We never had drugs back then,'' Mr. Chute said. ''If you did any type of drug, you weren't in a club. You would be thrown out, if they ever found out. All we did was drink, basically. We'd tap a keg out in the woods and have a good time.''</p>
        <p>Many of the boys' clubs were fraternities known by Greek letters, such as Alpha Delta Sigma. Their female counterparts bore names such as Theta Mu, Tri Hi Y, the Scotties and the Delta Caps. Official club jackets could only be worn by club members and their girlfriends.</p>
        <p>''I have to say, if you were dating someone from T.K., you got treated with respect,'' said Diane Vernale, a 1960's graduate who not only dated but married one.</p>
        <p>''But we weren't fighting clubs, we were good guys, too,'' said her husband, Joseph Vernale, an electrician in New Britain.</p>
        <p>Clubs held weekly meetings where officers were elected and dues were paid. Many also sponsored Friday night dances attended by all the other clubs. Money raised by these events was often donated to charities such as the children's hospital in Newington. Or if someone in town was seriously ill, ''we'd try to do a fund-raiser, usually a dance, a sock hop, to help them out on their bills,'' Mr. Chute said.</p>
        <p>This civic-mindedness was not out of character. ''We have a lot of doctors, professors, lawyers and numerous police officers. We even have a D.E.A. agent who was a club member,'' Mr. Chute said.</p>
        <p>One name he readily offers, though, is that of William J. MacNamara, a former six-term mayor of New Britain who is now chairman of the town's police board. MacNamara, a k a ''Billy Mac,'' was president of A.D.S. in the early '50's. ''We were out looking for rumbles,'' Mr. MacNamara said, ''and we would go to dances, and -- I won't admit to it officially -- but I imagine people would even have a couple beers before the dance. That was probably the most radical thing that was done.''</p>
        <p>Members of A.D.S. would drink cherry Cokes at a soda shop called Contaras, Mr. MacNamara said. Rival clubs would congregate at a luncheonette called St. Claire's Confectionery. But the real hot spot was a movie theater that has since closed, The Strand, ''because it was close to the high school and the girls as well as guys would walk by there. That was the place for us to strut, as peacocks would exhibit their feathers,'' Mr. MacNamara said.</p>
        <p>This was when New Britain was a booming factory town known for its hardware manufacturers and Main Street was glutted on Saturday afternoons and Thursday nights, when the stores stayed open late. If it all sounds a little more like ''Happy Days'' than ''The Wild Bunch,'' Mr. MacNamara claimed it was. While no one he knew used drugs, many club members were regular smokers. ''Of course, cigarettes then didn't have filter tips,'' Mr. MacNamara said. ''That was as far as we went with drugs: smoking a Pall Mall without a filter.''</p>
        <p>Lucian J. Pawlak, the current mayor of New Britain, said everyone was tough. ''It's an old blue-collar town, he said. ''You had to be tough.''</p>
        <p>But this youthful mettle served many club members well as they matured, he said.</p>
        <p>''That toughness translated into people becoming, in a lot of cases, very successful, very competitive, very ready-for-the-world kinds of people,'' Mr. Pawlak said. ''And no matter whatever comes, whether you hit a bad streak or you happen to be on a lucky streak, you were able to tolerate life in a way that I think a lot of people currently can't.''</p>
        <p>Paul Shaker, a member of Theta Sigma in the '50's and who now owns a New Britain funeral home, said it was a brotherhood.</p>
        <p>''I know a lot of the fellas who were ahead of me in school, and we still keep in touch,'' he said. ''We're still very friendly, and we would do almost anything for each other.''</p>
        <p>These groups thrived on a Three Musketeers mentality that required unwavering loyalty. Danny Larese, a New Britain mailman, recalls being interviewed for membership in T.K. If he was attacked by a rival club, he was asked, and his club members didn't help him, would they still be good guys? ''I don't know,'' he said he replied hesitantly. It was the wrong answer. He ended up joining The Blue Angels.</p>
        <p>Mr. MacNamara, the former mayor, plans to forego the reunion because of political differences he has with the national V.F.W. organization because, he said, the organization allowed President Clinton, who he considers a draft dodger, to speak at its national convention. Mr. Pawlak, however, is going.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of good to see everybody now that they're at the grandparent stage,'' he said. ''Physically, I guess we've all aged, but mentally we're still somewhere back in those high school days.''</p>
        <p>The event will be open from noon to 7 p.m. There will be beer, wine, and food, as well as a classic car show, arm wrestling, a horseshoes contest and karaoke. Admission is $12 per person; children under 12 are free. For tickets, call the Amber Club in New Britain, at (860) 223-9684.</p>
