        <p>To the Editor: Unfortunately, the scenarios described in ''Crime Takes a Vacation (Yours)'' (July 16) became a reality for us. While our group was in Madrid in August, I witnessed three episodes of street crime. In the Plaza Mayor we were approached by a mother-son pickpocket team. In the second, while walking in the Puerta del Sol, my friend was bumped by someone holding up watches supposedly for sale, followed immediately by his associate dangling keys in front of my face and then dropping them. When I failed to respond to this ploy, he grabbed my leg. After I struck him, he fled.</p>

        <p>The third episode occurred when our tour bus stopped at the Plaza de Colon to see a waterfall. As the last people, two women, were entering the bus, a group of young males approached. One ran up to each woman and tore their handbags from their leather straps, causing one woman to strike her head and injure her chest and the other to fall, fracturing her wrist. All this occurred during a three-day stay in Madrid.</p>
