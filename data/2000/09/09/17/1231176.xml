        <p>ONE Wednesday afternoon, I put on my CD ''Diana Ross and the Supremes Greatest Hits.'' Then my son and I danced around the dining room table to the warble of Diana's transistor-perfect ''I Hear a Symphony.'' It was a glorious moment. Outside we could hear and feel the energy of rush hour. The light pouring through the window was the golden color of the day fading to evening.</p>
        <p>We are in transition, too. Last Monday, my son began preschool and his entry into a world without me, my husband or his baby sitter by his side. At age 2, his academic debut consists of only a few hours twice a week, but for me it symbolizes the end of babyhood. I feel weepy for me and happy for him.</p>

        <p>ONE Wednesday afternoon, I put on my CD ''Diana Ross and the Supremes Greatest Hits.'' Then my son and I danced around the dining room table to the warble of Diana's transistor-perfect ''I Hear a Symphony.'' It was a glorious moment. Outside we could hear and feel the energy of rush hour. The light pouring through the window was the golden color of the day fading to evening.</p>
        <p>We are in transition, too. Last Monday, my son began preschool and his entry into a world without me, my husband or his baby sitter by his side. At age 2, his academic debut consists of only a few hours twice a week, but for me it symbolizes the end of babyhood. I feel weepy for me and happy for him.</p>
        <p>For all I thought I knew about separation anxiety, I was surprised by the intensity of my emotions. Later, it was a relief to find other parents who had the same feelings about their child's first steps to independence.</p>
        <p>The classes last week were only one hour, after all. They will gradually become longer. And I stayed right there in the classroom with him, sidelined on a tiny chair that was arranged in a row with five other perfectly pleasant mothers.</p>
        <p>The mundane tasks at hand were a good distraction from anxiety. We handed over changes of clothes for the children's cubicles, emergency contact forms, family photographs. Still. It was an Occasion.</p>
        <p>I had an image of mothers and fathers all over the city, taking a deep breath, pushing their children into the whirlwind at ever earlier ages to confront ever more uncertain realities.</p>
        <p>With preschool, we are on the precipice of what becomes for some an intense quest for the best schools, the best programs, the best books or the best music that will make our kids smart, sociable and competitive.</p>
        <p>You can buy in or bow out at your own level. But for many, the goal is those colleges that 15 years or so hence will be even more outrageously priced and selective than they are now.</p>
        <p>As part of the mix, my friends and I talk about the complexities of race and sex, because even middle and upper-middle-class African-American boys like my son are too often judged as outlaws early in the game.</p>
        <p>We know that in academic settings they can be labeled ''hyper'' rather than ''energetic,'' or ''aggressive'' rather than ''assertive.'' As parents we try to straddle that line between being ever-vigilant about misperceptions and giving our children a sense of belonging in a world of privilege.</p>
        <p>More than anything else, though, we all just want our children to be happy and understood. We wonder how the little habits that play so well in the privacy of our homes will strike the strangers who will now judge them, and us.</p>
        <p>To make the separation process more seamless, the teacher came to our home the day before school started. Everybody liked each other.</p>
        <p>The nascent scholar, though, felt that something was up on Monday as we went to the first class. He clung to me, refusing to walk and even refusing to stand outside the classroom. The tension was defused when a classmate caught his eye and they played a game. She hid under her mother's shirt and then peered out, again and again, to their mutual delight.</p>
        <p>So I sat there on my little chair, hoping that my son would somehow be both part of the group and his own independent self.</p>
        <p>Like the other children, he mostly played alone. He lined up farm animals and pushed around fire trucks. He refused to go to the snack table with everyone else (oh, what does that mean?), he threw his rice cake on the floor at another point (were all eyes on us?) and when we sat in a circle to sing and clap, he promptly jumped up and danced alone in the middle of the group, a huge smile on his face.</p>
        <p>The teacher and the assistants were sweet. It's fine, they murmured. Everyone does everything at his own rhythm. So we left the same way we entered, clingy and vaguely brooding, but relieved .</p>
        <p>When we got home, the telephone rang. The friend on the other end said she was drained because she was going through separation with both her preschool son and her daughter, who just entered kindergarten.</p>
        <p>On the first day of kindergarten, she was so teary-eyed and choked up she could barely speak to the teacher. Her daughter was fine.</p>
        <p>Another friend, Bonnie, also called. Her son, like mine, turns 3 next spring. The boys are in different classes in the same preschool program.</p>
        <p>''I teared up a couple of times,'' she admitted.</p>
        <p>''It's a combination of your own experience and remembering starting school and the loneliness, the fears at that age,'' Bonnie said. ''We know our children so well. We know their little foibles as well as their spectacular, beautiful qualities. There's just a wish for everyone to know how special your child is.</p>
        <p>''This is it,'' she said with a sigh. ''Moving into the circle. Clapping when you're supposed to. Sharing. Cleaning up after your messes.''</p>
