        <p>So You Want to Be President?</p>
        <p>By Judith St. George.</p>
        <p>Illustrated by David Small.</p>
        <p>52 pp. New York:</p>

        <p>(Ages 5 to 9)</p>
        <p>Pokemon characters are not available to run for president this year, so parents who want to awaken their school-age children to the wonders of our national electoral system must find other ways to do the job. Admittedly, this is not a universal problem. But at my house, when the children complain about having to watch ''Meet the Press'' or ''Crossfire'' on television, I explain the facts of life simply. Some parents are obsessed with football and baseball, I tell them, but their parents are obsessed with elections.</p>
        <p>Judith St. George's charming book, ''So You Want to Be President?,'' offers a much more effective method of prompting young people's curiosity about politics. With David Small's amusing drawings of presidents past and present, it takes the reader on a chatty tour, introducing characteristics of all 41 chief executives from a child's point of view. The principle here seems to be that any child who contemplates living in the White House should know or try some of these things.</p>
        <p>We learn that it is not necessary to be handsome, rich, well educated or even very friendly to be president of the United States. We also find out who was the fattest president (William Howard Taft, weighing in at more than 300 pounds and shown being lowered by crane into his bathtub) and who had the most pets and the most fun (Teddy Roosevelt). My son loved hearing that T.R.'s son Quentin once took a Shetland pony up the White House elevator, and that T.R. himself had pillow fights with his children, played football on the White House lawn and was someone of whom a friend once said, ''You must always remember that the president is about 6.''</p>
        <p>Eight presidents were born in log cabins and six were named James (though one preferred to be called Jimmy). ''Some presidents threw money around and some were penny pinchers,'' St. George tells us; James Monroe brought 93 crates of expensive furniture to the White House, but William Henry Harrison walked to market every morning ''with a basket over his arm.'' These attributes make for some comically evocative images.</p>
        <p>''So You Want to Be President?'' is easy enough to read even for children in the lower grades, but like many such books it is ideally enjoyed by a child with an adult. That way, its rich anecdotes provoke questions, answers, definitions, recollections and more anecdotes, including dog stories. St. George tells us, ''Franklin Roosevelt's dog, Fala, was almost as famous as his owner,'' giving me an opening to tell my daughter about how F.D.R. mocked the Republicans for complaining that Fala was rescued from the sea at government expense.</p>
        <p>Toward the end St. George directly confronts an issue that could prompt discussion. ''One thing is certain,'' she says; ''if you want to be president -- and stay president -- be honest.'' Harry Truman and Grover Cleveland are cited, followed by this impeccable observation:</p>
        <p>''Other presidents weren't so honest. Democrat Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath. Republican Richard Nixon's staff broke into Democratic headquarters to steal campaign secrets. He covered up the crime and then lied about it. (That was the end of Richard Nixon as president!)'' A striking blue-tinted double-page illustration shows a brooding Clinton and a frowning Nixon descending the steps of the Lincoln Memorial as Honest Abe looks down.</p>
        <p>We liked St. George's ''can-do'' attitude, the way she implicitly asks what we, the readers, might do to emulate the men who got to the White House. As in: ''If you want to be president, you might consider joining the Army.'' She names 10 presidents who were generals and a few others, like John F. Kennedy, who were war heroes. To balance things out, she emphasizes nicely that although no women or ''person of color'' or ''person who wasn't a Protestant or a Roman Catholic'' has been president, that day will come.</p>
        <p>All the recent presidents, including Nixon and Clinton, make positive appearances. In witty illustrations, Nixon is shown bowling at the White House and Reagan is shown holding a movie fan magazine while being fitted for a suit by Andrew Johnson, the only tailor to become president. And what child could resist the statement that the president ''doesn't have to eat yucky vegetables,'' or George Bush's refusal to eat broccoli in office?</p>
        <p>If it suits you, this book is also an easy jumping-off point for a discussion of Al Gore, George W. Bush or anyone else running this year. There is nothing here about the weighty things that presidents do, though the president's oath of office is given and poignantly described. ''Only 35 words! But it's a big order when you're president of this country.''</p>
        <p>When we finished reading I announced, spontaneously, that I would now attempt to recite, in order, all the names of the presidents, letting my daughter check me from the annotated list at the back. I always get a little wobbly back in the 1840's, but what better way to demonstrate to your child that this is something you care about, and a lot of fun, too?</p>
