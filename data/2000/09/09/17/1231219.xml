        <p>Your heart thrills to the sestina and the villanelle; haiku and blank verse quicken your senses. Now, O lover of poetry, are you ready for Toni Blackman's Hip-Hop 101?</p>
        <p>The rhythm, rhyme and wordplay of hip-hop and rap lyrics will be featured at the Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival this Thursday through Sunday in Waterloo Village in Stanhope.</p>
        <p>Rap, which was included once before, in 1986, ''is clearly one of the world languages now,'' saidJames Haba, the festival's director. So the biennial gathering, described as the largest poetry event in North America -- some 15,000 people are expected -- will try ''to make an even bigger tent for poetry'' by recognizing rap artists and other songwriters as poets, Mr. Haba said.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, in a performance geared for students (although all are welcome), Ms. Blackman, a freestylist, said she would talk about hip-hop's roots in the African oral tradition and demonstrate through improvisation the command of language and mental dexterity that make it an art form. ''It's sort of Hip-Hop 101,'' she said with a laugh. On Friday, for teachers, she will dissect the stereotypes surrounding rap and urban culture.</p>
        <p>Stanley Kunitz, the next poet laureate of the United States; Newark-born C. K. Williams, who received the Pulitzer Prize for poetry this year; the Nigerian poet and novelist Chinua Achebe, and dozens of other poets, musicians and storytellers will appear at the festival.</p>
        <p>Ticketmaster has tickets. The schedule of events is at www.grdodge.org/poetry/.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Haba said he would try again in two years to persuade Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan to accept the mantle of poet and attend.</p>
