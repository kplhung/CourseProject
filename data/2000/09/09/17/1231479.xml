        <p>President Clinton spent much of his youth trying to stay out of Vietnam, and much of his presidency figuring out how to draw it into America's orbit. Now, he is finally planning a visit, scheduled for after the presidential elections, in his waning days as commander in chief. The agenda includes putting a new trade deal in place and encouraging the search for the bodies of soldiers still listed as missing in action, but that may be overshadowed by the drama of the first visit by an American president since the war's end.</p>
