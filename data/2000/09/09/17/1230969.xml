        <p>Name: Derek Bell  Age: 31  Coming from: Houston  Looking for: A championship</p>
        <p>Derek Bell, who is earning $5.2 million as the New York Mets' right fielder this season, is taking batting practice a few hours before an evening game with the Atlanta Braves. The crowd has yet to enter Shea Stadium in Flushing. A sweet-faced, cornfed girl from Somewhere, U.S.A., is standing on the ball field practicing the national anthem over the public address system. She sings earnestly. She sings flat. She is not good. She is resoundingly booed -- by the hot dog vendors.</p>
        <p>''New York's a tough town, yo,'' says Bell.</p>
        <p>He did not plan to come to New York, and New York did not plan to have him. But Derek Bell became Mets property in January as a toss-in, a 31-year-old has-been who batted .236 with 12 home runs and 66 r.b.i. last year with the Houston Astros, all career lows. The Mets were forced to take him and his salary as part of the deal that brought the left-handed ace Mike Hampton here. At his news conference in January, D. Bell -- as his teammates call him -- assured the media that he had a lot left in him. He promised to love New York and promised to make New York love him. He promised to eat in cool restaurants. He promised to find a cool place to live in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>New York Lesson No. 1. ''The rent here is really high, yo?''</p>
        <p>D. Bell likes to live nicely. He has more than 100 pairs of alligator shoes: black-and-blue wingtips, white-and-coral-and-black wingtips, coral wingtips, black wingtips, white wingtips. He has a six-bedroom house in his hometown, Tampa, five of them filled with orange suits, turquoise suits, green suits and more shoes.</p>
        <p>''I got clothes, yo,'' he explains. ''I got to be representing. I don't want to get caught slippin'.'' He has five vehicles -- three trucks, a new Mercedes-Benz and a maroon convertible Rolls- Royce. He has a yacht, a speedboat and a fishing boat. He wears a gold-and-diamond baseball pendant, gold-and-diamond studs and a gold-and-diamond watch.</p>
        <p>''I mean, I got things, and I needed a place to put them,'' he states as a matter of fact as he dresses his long, lanky body for the ballgame.</p>
        <p>So D. Bell went looking for a two-bedroom apartment in January. ''I knew New York was expensive, but yo! When I went looking for a two-bedroom, I was thinking somewhere around 14 or 15.''</p>
        <p>He found a lot of two-bedrooms renting for around 14 or 15 a month. The problem was, D. Bell was talking 14 or 15 hundred. The real estate agent was talking 14 or 15 thousand.</p>
        <p>''And then you got to pay the agent a month's commission. I said hell no. I mean, I could afford it, but why should I when I got options?''</p>
        <p>The option was keeping most of his stuff in Tampa while bringing his 58-foot Sea Ray 800 yacht (''How many times I got to say it's not a boat, yo, it's a yacht'') to New York. He began living on it in April when the season began. On a couple of occasions, he has sailed it to work at Shea Stadium. It is tied up on the West Side of Manhattan in a marina close to a popular tourist spot, and he will pay for the slip by doing some publicity for the owner.</p>
        <p>''The funny thing is, yo, it's got more room than in the penthouses I was looking at,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Lesson No. 2: ''Never keep the fish.''</p>
        <p>D. Bell's yacht sits in the Hudson River among the floating bottles and plastic and foam cups. It is leather and smoked glass and has a garage for his Jet Ski, two bedrooms, two full baths, a kitchen and a wall full of electronica. Like many New York apartments, it has only beer in the refrigerator, and the stove has never been used.</p>
        <p>On the deck there is a bottle of Hennessy and a leather couch and beyond that is the pier where tourists walk by. A slightly plump white woman sits up there, wearing a skirt, her legs slightly apart.</p>
        <p>D. Bell, the fisherman, casts his line: ''Hey, pssst. 'Scuse me. You waiting for somebody?''</p>
        <p>''Five more minutes,'' she says. ''Five more minutes and I'm getting on your boat.''</p>
        <p>''You can get on my boat anytime, baby.''</p>
        <p>She melts into a dopey smile. She keeps tugging down on her top. It's not clear if she knows that this is D. Bell, although his face is unmistakable. The squash-shaped head, the thick goatee, deep lines running across his forehead, the beanpole body. It doesn't matter, because D. Bell knows by now that in New York it's good enough to look as if you're someone worth knowing.</p>
        <p>''You need a new friend?'' he asks her.</p>
        <p>''No telling what I need,'' she says.</p>
        <p>D. Bell spends his time away from the ballpark on his yacht with his head down, a drink in his hands, listening to people whisper, ''Is that really him?''</p>
        <p>D. Bell is one of the few New York professional athletes to live in Manhattan. He is the only one living on a yacht. He has never really invited the gawking women aboard. It's sort of like catch and release. A tease. He learned that lesson a long time ago. It was April 1994, and D. Bell was playing for the San Diego Padres. He and a teammate were arrested at East 30th Street and Lexington Avenue for soliciting sex from two undercover policewomen. The players said they were teasing and pleaded not guilty. The charges were dropped six months later for a lack of evidence.</p>
        <p>So now D. Bell, who sometimes refers to himself in the third person, rarely goes out. And when he does, he says, ''I'm chill.'' He does not trust the motives of many New York women. He has never been to Central Park, he says. He has never visited a museum. He has never seen a show. His clothes are imported from Cincinnati. ''Don't need any of that. Just gimme my hip-hop music and my game and I'm happy.''</p>
        <p>Lesson No. 3: ''Drive like the cabbies do.''</p>
        <p>His first month in right field, D. Bell proved to most everybody that he still has something in the tank. He displayed a great glove and a .385 batting average. But it wasn't until May that he got the nerve to drive in the big city. It scared him, he doesn't mind saying. ''The way these fools drive, I wasn't sure.'' But the more he saw of it, the more he liked the challenge.</p>
        <p>He brought his truck to New York, and he has the driving figured out.</p>
        <p>''There's basically three rules,'' he says:</p>
        <p>1) Whoever has his front end ahead of the other has the right of way.</p>
        <p>2) When in doubt use the gas pedal.</p>
        <p>3) Never use the brakes.</p>
        <p>''Now I drive like a fool anyway possible like the cabbies do. And New Yorkers know you, yo. They know all about ball. I'll be sitting there in traffic and they'll say, like, 'Hey, yo, Derek,' like rootin,' you know? It ain't like that in Houston.''</p>
