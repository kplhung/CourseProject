        <p>THE big white poodle with the pow der puffs on her hips  called rosettes in the trimming trade -- was sniffing around the Eukanuba booth, trying to get a fix on whether she liked beef or chicken best.</p>
        <p>Down the grassy path, an Airedale named Ratatat Notorious Nick was getting clipped by his past owner, who had tried to show him a while back but had decided he didn't have the right temperament: he just yawned at the judges. So now Nick, with his new owners, was attending the show as a mere household pet.</p>
        <p>This was midday break time at the Westchester Kennel Club show, held for the last 27 years here at Lyndhurst, the mid-19th century limestone Gothic castle-ette overlooking the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>And whether they were the clipped-to-the-toenail types or the shaggy kid's companion types, the dogs were clearly in charge.</p>
        <p>Regina Norman, a Manhattan paralegal with a Westchester County daughter, was chatting with several dog people, her wire-haired fox terrier, Sam, pulling at his leash as some good-looking whippets gamboled by.</p>
        <p>''Sam enjoys the chance to observe his more carefully groomed cousins,'' Ms. Norman said, adding that her less carefully groomed 14-year-old dog has been coming to the Lyndhurst show for six years. Sam likes the show, she explained, because of the beautiful show grounds -- ''it's not claustrophobic like the Westminster show at Madison Square Garden,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Although some of the thousands of dog lovers attending the event come to pick out a breed as part of an upcoming dog purchase, or to find breeders in a breed already chosen, most of them -- like Ms. Norman -- come to cheer on their favorite type of dog, said H. Anthony Hodges, who has been judging the Westchester show since 1959 and was wearing a special badge, which gave him the rank of ''Emeritus.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hodges, decked out in his straw skimmer, was possibly the most dapper of a dapper group of kennel club members -- only men can be members -- who wore navy blazers, cream-colored trousers and special blue rep ties with three white stripes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hodges, 82, who came from the Pittsburgh area, explained the judging to a dog show novice.</p>
        <p>''First are the contests for all the different classes,'' he said. ''Then it's like boxing: a knock out, with the winner of each class going up the ladder.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, they pick the overall best of breed. Then the dogs compete in the group categories: terriers, hounds, toys, herding, working sporting and non-sporting. Then they pick Best in Show. (This year, a Shih Tzu named Charing Cross Ragtime Cowboy captured Best in Show.)</p>
        <p>All the judging was going on in the cordoned-off rings. But the shows outside the ring were equally fascinating.</p>
        <p>Down toward the river, the vizslas, Hungarian hunting dogs, were having a meet-and-greet and picnic, with their owners sitting around on folding chairs, chatting, comparing ribbons and watching their sleek brown, medium-size dogs cavort.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Hodges strode across the greensward, he passed another veteran: Joyce Wilson, who has bred Irish terriers (a little-known breed: 110th most popular, out of 140) for more than 40 years. She was busy touting her particular type of dog to a tall, middle-age man in a tweed jacket who was considering buying one in the future.</p>
        <p>''They're a lot of dog in a medium-size package,'' Ms. Wilson said, gesturing toward a friendly auburn-colored Irish terrier named Mulligan. ''A man can walk them and not be embarrassed. And a woman can still handle them.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilson was brusque when asked by the potential Irish terrier owner if she would consider selling a puppy to someone with a large property without fences.</p>
        <p>''No,'' she replied, horrified. ''Dogs have been lost, killed, sleeping in a driveway, when a big delivery truck comes in. If they run off and you can't catch them, they could run out into the road and be hit. And you know terriers: once they see game, like a squirrel, you can't stop them.''</p>
        <p>Mulligan did look as if he was ready to chase any squirrel in sight (not that there were many, with all those people). But Nick, the big Airedale that had yawned at the judges during his brief dog show career, didn't look very energetic, even though Airedales are the biggest terriers of all and can also be the most rambunctious. He was standing very quietly while his rather shaggy coat was being clipped.</p>
        <p>Nick's first owner, Joel Garcia, 37, of Brooklyn, said the dog does indeed chase squirrels (and deer) -- any chance he gets.</p>
        <p>''He'd rather chase squirrels, mark territory, harass female dogs, even start playful fights with other dogs,'' Mr. Garcia, a teacher, said. ''In other words, he'd rather just play. And after he plays, he wants to sleep.''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Garcia sold Nick to Mary and Michael Moran, who live on an acre of land on Long Island, he said. ''As beautiful as he is, he found the ring absolutely boring.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia and his wife, Evelyn, also a schoolteacher, bought Nina (a k a Gallaire's Delaterra Nina), who loves to show off.</p>
        <p>At the show, Mr. Garcia said, Nina won a best puppy contest. ''And she's not even 12 months old!'' he said, like any proud parent.</p>
