        <p>If you're a chief executive attending the Olympics, where do you stay? Forget the local Ritz-Carlton. Get yourself a yacht, or better yet, an entire cruise liner and dock it next to Sydney's landmark Opera House. That's what Louis Gerstner of I.B.M. did. Mr. Gerstner is staying on a giant cruise liner that I.B.M. rented for the Olympics; he will play host to dozens of parties and meetings there. As a major sponsor of the Games, I.B.M. is flying about 2,000 employees and clients to Sydney to show off the technology it developed for the Games.</p>
        <p>An I.B.M. spokesman refused to say how much the floating accommodations cost.</p>

        <p>So are Mr. Gerstner's Olympic plans universal? Not exactly. Ask Jack Greenberg, the chief executive of McDonald's. He will woo customers by flipping burgers at Olympic Park with minimum-wage employees.</p>
