        <p>At night, Madrid overflows with life, as the city's residents take to the avenues and winding cobblestone streets, eager to enjoy good food and wine, lively conversation, music and dance. After the lights come on along grand, tree-lined Paseo de la Castellana and flicker in the baroque Plaza de Cibeles fountain, crowds fill the outdoor restaurants and tapas bars in the spacious 17th-century Plaza Mayor and the smaller Plaza Santa Ana.</p>
        <p>Later, not far away, jazz wafts from Cafe Central at 10 Plaza del Angel; a five-minute walk from there, at the elegant El Salon del Prado, a 4 Calle del Prado, chamber groups entertain on Thursday nights. For dancing to tunes from the 60's, 70's and 80's, the place to go is the funky Why Not?, a bar popular with both gays and straights at 6 Calle San Bartolome in Chueca.</p>

        <p>At night, Madrid overflows with life, as the city's residents take to the avenues and winding cobblestone streets, eager to enjoy good food and wine, lively conversation, music and dance. After the lights come on along grand, tree-lined Paseo de la Castellana and flicker in the baroque Plaza de Cibeles fountain, crowds fill the outdoor restaurants and tapas bars in the spacious 17th-century Plaza Mayor and the smaller Plaza Santa Ana.</p>
        <p>Later, not far away, jazz wafts from Cafe Central at 10 Plaza del Angel; a five-minute walk from there, at the elegant El Salon del Prado, a 4 Calle del Prado, chamber groups entertain on Thursday nights. For dancing to tunes from the 60's, 70's and 80's, the place to go is the funky Why Not?, a bar popular with both gays and straights at 6 Calle San Bartolome in Chueca.</p>
        <p>But for flamenco aficionados, there's only one destination. Since its opening in 1983, Casa Patas, at 10 Calle de Canizares, has built a reputation as the best club in Spain to see this ancient, haunting art form, except for spontaneous shows in small Andalusian villages.</p>
        <p>While most flamenco clubs (tablaos) offer watered-down flamenco served up by bored entertainers, some of Spain's top flamenco dancers and musicians give heart-wrenching performances at the cozy, comfortable 120-seat theater within this bustling restaurant in the center of the old city. (In October, it plans to begin lunchtime performances at 1:30 every day.)</p>
        <p>Entering Casa Patas, you come into a bright, noisy room, on most nights packed with customers sitting at tables laden with pitchers of sangria and plates of food or sipping drinks at the long gleaming wood bar that runs the length of the room. Photographs on the walls of famous flamenco divas, polka dot skirts swirling about them, attended by dashing partners, give some idea of what's in store.</p>
        <p>You can tell a show is in the offing when a line starts forming at the rear of the restaurant. In the darkened theater, tables are set around a small raised stage. The waiters hurry to take orders for tapas and drinks, then silence reigns. These performers demand total attention as they move their bodies in sinuous lines and stamp their feet with ferocious power.</p>
        <p>After Casa Patas closes, flamenco dancers and musicians and their fans often make their way to nearby El Candela, at 2 Calle del Omo. The guitarist Paco de Lucia and the dancer Antonio Canales occasionally stop by for legendary jam sessions in the cavelike bar in the cellar or in the dark narrow first-floor bar. There's no better way to experience the heady spirit of flamenco.</p>
        <p>Cafe Central, 10 Plaza del Angel, (34-91) 369-4143. Admission for live shows, $5.50 to $7, at 185 pesetas to the dollar.</p>
        <p>El Salon del Prado, 4 Calle del Prado, (34-91) 429-3361. Free entry.</p>
        <p>Why Not? 6 Calle San Bartolome, No phone. Closed Sunday. Cover charge, $5.40 (includes one drink).</p>
        <p>Casa Patas, 10 Calle de Canizares, (34-91) 369-0496. Closed Sunday. Admission, $9 to $13.50. Reservations necessary. A 1:30 p.m. show, planned Monday to Friday starting in October, $2.70.</p>
        <p>El Candela, 2 Calle del Olmo, (34-91) 467-3382. Free admission.</p>
