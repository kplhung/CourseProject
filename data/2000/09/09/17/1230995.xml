        <p>NYPD</p>
        <p>A City and Its Police.</p>
        <p>By James Lardner</p>
        <p>and Thomas Reppetto.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 368 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>A John Macrae Book/</p>
        <p>Henry Holt &amp; Company. $27.50.</p>
        <p>A friend of mine, an ex-New York City police officer, once told me the following story: One night during his rookie year he had given chase to a robbery suspect. The chase led to a stairwell, where the suspect turned on my friend, pummeling and kicking him. My friend managed to subdue the suspect, but not before he was bloodied up good.</p>
        <p>The rookie officer brought the handcuffed suspect, who was unhurt and ostentatiously nonchalant about his arrest, to the precinct house, expecting praise, or if not praise -- this was the N.Y.P.D. after all -- then silent approval for his valiant deed. He did not expect to be met by withering scorn. As he tells it, his captain saw him in his disheveled and bloodied state, and proceeded to ream him out: ''If somebody's going to do that to you,'' he recalls the captain saying, ''he'd better be covered with his own blood by the time you bring him in here.''</p>
        <p>It was an episode in ''NYPD: A City and Its Police,'' a fascinating and often delightful (but ultimately frustrating) history of the world's most famous police department, that brought this story to mind. The authors, James Lardner and Thomas Reppetto, describe a lineup at which Fiorello LaGuardia's police commissioner, Lewis J. Valentine, made an appearance. Valentine, like his boss, is still counted as one of the more effective officials ever to have served the people of New York -- though Lardner and Reppetto are not overly enamored of any of the men who have sat behind the commissioner's desk, including Theodore Roosevelt and Valentine himself. During the lineup, one of the men standing there, well-dressed and smug, was identified to Valentine as a murderer. ''He's the best-dressed man in this room,'' Valentine told the officers present. ''Yet he's never worked a day in his life. When you meet men like this, don't be afraid to muss 'em up. Men like him should be mussed up. Blood should be smeared all over that velvet collar.''</p>
        <p>In my friend's case, his captain rose to become one of the highest-ranking officials at 1 Police Plaza in the 1990's, and served in the N.Y.P.D. for decades without ever acquiring a public reputation for thuggishness. The moral of the story, my friend says, was this: police work is rough work, and everybody gets his hands dirty. The only difference between smart cops and dumb cops is that the smart cops use their fists with discretion. Valentine was simply giving voice to one of the immutable beliefs of the New York City police officer, that ''contempt-of-cop,'' as it is called, is the worst crime of all.</p>
        <p>''NYPD,'' a work of popular history that takes place mainly in the distant past, teaches us several things about the police in New York City: the first is that, in the 155 years since the N.Y.P.D. became a more-or-less professional crime-fighting force, nothing has changed: brutality is still an issue, as is incompetence, as is tension between white cops and black citizens, and only extreme vigilance keeps the lid on corruption.</p>
        <p>The book also teaches us, however, that everything has changed.</p>
        <p>The N.Y.P.D. is, today, probably one of the best police forces in the world, and this wasn't always so. It is famously good at crime control; its detectives are sophisticated; its science is good; its tactical capacity excellent. It is integrated by sex and race (not enough, but what is?) and its men and women, sometimes in spite of the department's leadership, generally perform their jobs professionally. It is also, despite the rash conclusions of some on the anti-cop left, a force in control of itself. ''Fatal shootings of civilians by the N.Y.P.D. are at a modern low,'' Lardner and Reppetto write. ''The 11 New Yorkers killed in such incidents last year were less than one-fifth the number killed annually in the early 1970's, when the unabashedly liberal John V. Lindsay was mayor.''</p>
        <p>Lardner and Reppetto know their subject. Lardner is a first-rate reporter on the police, author of a very good book on David Durk, the unsung hero of the Serpico corruption case, and a former police officer in Washington. Reppetto, too, is a former cop and is president of New York's Citizens Crime Commission.</p>
        <p>The authors withhold their own opinions through most of the book, but it is clear they believe that, with notable exceptions, the N.Y.P.D. has until recently been run by fools, and that maniacs and men of violence have long been overrepresented in the ranks. The stories of graft they tell are also amazing. After noting in world-weary fashion that police scandals erupt like clockwork every 20 years, the authors take us on a shocking tour of some of the worst scandals. During one investigation early in the last century, it came to light that some of the city's vice cops ''had six-figure bank accounts on salaries of, typically, $3,000 a year.'' And they tell the story of Charles Becker, the only New York City police officer ever to be executed for his crimes (he was convicted of ordering the killing of a notorious gambler, Herman Rosenthal, who wouldn't cooperate in the proper allocation of graft money).</p>
        <p>The Becker scandal brought down one of the more hapless commissioners in N.Y.P.D. history, Rhinelander Waldo, a fool plucked from the halls of the Fire Department who delivered lectures like ''How to Wipe Out Police Graft'' as his officers were stealing the city out from under him.</p>
        <p>Lardner and Reppetto are at their most amusing when they catalog the foibles of the men who have run the N.Y.P.D.. They make short work of my favorite, Theodore Bingham, the Charles Murray of his day. Bingham is remembered, if he's remembered at all, for his views on the role of minorities in crime. At the beginning of the 20th century, the minorities were different, but the canards were the same. ''Jews went into crime,'' the authors quote Bingham as writing, ''because they were unfit for hard labor.'' Italians, he further explained, were a ''riffraff of desperate scoundrels, ex-convicts and jailbirds.'' Bingham was a racial profiler before the practice had a name.</p>
        <p>Lardner and Reppetto make clear that outrageous graft is no longer an overwhelming problem of the N.Y.P.D. But race, they suggest, is still its Achilles' heel. They report with typical restraint an astonishing fact: the high point in relations between New York City cops and African-Americans came nearly 140 years ago, during the city's draft riots, when white mobs targeted blacks for lynching. Many of Manhattan's blacks fled to Brooklyn by boat, but many others were given shelter by the all-white police force in its station houses. ''In another ghastly episode, rioters torched the Coloured Orphan Asylum, on Fifth Avenue between Forty-third and Forty-fourth Streets,'' the authors write. ''One little girl was burned to death, and more than 200 children were evacuated to the 20th Precinct. . . . About 700 other blacks had taken refuge at police headquarters.''</p>
        <p>Contrast this episode with the slogan written on a protester's placard in 1964 after a cop shot to death a black teenager on the Upper East Side: ''Save Us From Our Protectors,'' it read.</p>
        <p>Lardner and Reppetto are at their most interesting when they talk about race and the N.Y.P.D. Unfortunately for the reader, they don't say enough about race, and this is an example of the book's greatest failure: they have simply decided to write about too much. This is a book that includes the life and death of the famed anti-Mafia investigator Joe Petrosino; the philosophy of Jack Maple, the brain behind William J. Bratton's policing revolution; the career of Willie Sutton; the social engineering of John Lindsay; and the nefarious deeds of a World War I German spy ring -- and this list is a very partial menu. ''NYPD'' is at once chronological and scattershot, and the authors run out of steam -- and, apparently, the desire to place their fascinating research in much context -- just as they reach the modern era.</p>
        <p>This book is a contradiction: it is immensely enjoyable to read, but quite unsatisfying as a work of definitive history. Lardner and Reppetto would have been better off writing separate books on relations between cops and the societies they police; on police management; and on corruption. With any luck, they one day will.</p>
