        <p>I was 20 years old and had come from five months working as a crane operator at the Bethlehem Steel Mills in Sparrows Point, Md., near Baltimore. I had managed to save about $1,200, and that would be my stake to get started in music school in New York. It would carry me for about only half a year, so I immediately began a series of day jobs to supplement my savings. And that's how I managed for most of the next 21 years -- working as a truck loader, furniture mover, plumber, artist's assistant (to Richard Serra) and, yes, taxi driver. Looking back, I think it was the furniture moving that provided me with my most intimate knowledge of the life of the city. I started a moving company with my friend and cousin, the artist Jene Highstein. We discovered early on that the secret of success in the moving business was the company's name. After a few false starts we came up with ''Chelsea Light Moving.'' The name seemed to evoke feelings of confidence in our customers and gave us an air of professionalism, which wasn't exactly accurate.</p>
        <p>Since most moving takes place at the end and beginning of each month, we would place an ad in The Village Voice around the 15th. By the end of the month, we'd have reservations for about 10 days' worth of work. We rented a truck on the Bowery for a couple of weeks, and we were in business.</p>

        <p>I discovered that house moving is always a crisis in people's lives, a most vulnerable moment. Whatever unfinished personal business people have seems to spill out of their furniture and half-packed boxes. A few hours moving someone from house to house, and you will know more about them than their psychiatrist can find out in months on the couch. No question.</p>
        <p>One particularly poignant story: we were moving a young couple out of their West Village apartment. They were separating, and they were dividing up their household belongings right there on the sidewalk. It was going along O.K. until they finally got to the last item -- a wind-up pendulum clock made to sit on a mantelpiece. They were both getting quite worked up about it, and there was no resolution in sight. I saw that they couldn't settle it between themselves, so I quietly picked it up and put it in the cab of our truck. They didn't say a word.</p>
