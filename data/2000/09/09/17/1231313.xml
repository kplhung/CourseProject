        <p>City Councilwoman Eva Moskowitz says her Upper East Side district has more bicycle scofflaws than any other, and she wants to circulate a list of the worst repeat offenders, which she thinks are deliverers for local  restaurants. But the police won't give her the information.</p>
        <p>''Last year, the 19th Precinct issued 3,000 summonses for bicycle infractions,'' Ms. Moskowitz said. ''That was the highest in the city.'' She said the restaurant deliverers ''ride fast and furiously and often against the flow of traffic and on sidewalks'' and  ''terrify the elderly.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Moskowitz praised the police for aggressive action against illegal bicyclists, but said the problem persisted. ''So I thought, 'Why not boycott businesses violating the law?' '' she said. ''I wanted to publicize those establishments with the worst violation records.''</p>
        <p>In February, the councilwoman asked Inspector Jack McManus, commander of the 19th Precinct, for a list of offenders, but he told her that permission was needed from the police Legal Department, which denied the request.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moskowitz began lobbying the police for the information. ''I wrote letters, I had meetings, I had conference calls, all to no avail,'' she said, adding that police were also failing to enforce a law requiring delivery bicyclists to display the name and identification number of their employer.</p>
        <p>The police did not respond to requests for details of the Legal Department's position or of its enforcement of the display law.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moskowitz says disclosure of the list makes sense. ''After all, they opened the sealed record of Patrick Dorismond,'' she said, referring to the security guard shot by the police in March.</p>
