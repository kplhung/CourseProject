        <p>AVRA *  [Rating: one star]  (212) 759-8550; 141 East 48th Street, between Third and Lexington Avenues; $$$; smoking section; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This Greek restaurant, divided into two large dining rooms, has a spacious, easy feeling, and decorative pieces that suggest a country taverna. The seafood counter offers about a dozen fish listed on the menu and perhaps another two picked up at the market. Current appetizers include peasant seafood vegetable soup, and carp roe mousse with fresh lemon juice and red onion. Entrees include Atlantic salmon wrapped in grape leaves with baked orzo; souvlaki of grilled swordfish with tomato and peppers; and lamb loin chops with lemon Avra potatoes and okra.

        <p>CAFE CENTRO **  [Rating: two stars]  (212) 818-1222; 200 Park Avenue, at 45th Street; $$$; smoking on terrace; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This lavish brasserie is a landscape of polished marble and buffed brass. Appetizers include steamed Prince Edward Island mussels; grilled asparagus salad, smoked mallard duck, arugula and almonds;  and jumbo lump crab cake, with whole grain mustard and sea bean salad. Entrees include baked Eastern halibut, chanterelles, Yukon potato gnocchi and fava beans; medallion of beef, roasted Yukon gold potatoes, sun-dried tomato and olives; and risotto of lobster, fava beans and sweet corn. (Review: 3/29/96)</p>
        <p>MANGIA +++  (212) 754-0637; 16 East 48th Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues; $; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The sandwiches, made to order, are the best at this Italian takeout lunch factory. Starters include vegetable tarts; grilled asparagus with lemon zest and extra-virgin olive oil; and basil Parmesan or sesame-roasted chicken salad. Entrees include grilled Norwegian salmon with mesclun and grain salad; and lemon-grilled chicken on mixed greens.  Sandwiches include pecan-crusted chicken salad with onion jam, a creole aioli and arugula on Pullman white bread; French ham and aged cheddar with sliced apples and walnut aioli on grilled country bread; and prosciutto, salami and provolone hero with red onions, roasted peppers, romaine lettuce, olive oil and vinegar on semolina bread. (New York Today: April 1998)</p>
        <p>PATROON ***  [Rating: three stars]  (212) 883-7373; 160 East 46th Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues; $$$; smoking section; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere here is like a luxurious clubhouse with low lights and smooth textures; the banquettes are preferable to the tables. First course include jumbo lump crab cake with avocado and tomato quenelle and horseradish sauce; risotto Parmesan with wild mushrooms, sweet peas and asparagus; and citrus-cured salmon with caviar and cream and a fingerling potato salad. Entrees include Long Island duck breast, crisp confit with brandied cherries, ginger and port; organic roast chicken for two, pearl onions, brussels sprouts, apple-smoked bacon with tarragon jus; seared black-peppered yellowfin tuna, crisp okra saute and slow-roasted tomato emulsion; and Dover sole, grilled or sauteed, celery root and potato gratin, served at table. (Review: 10/7/98)</p>
        <p>SUSHI YASUDA ***  [Rating: three stars]  (212) 972-1001; 204 East 43rd Street, between Second and Third Avenues; $$$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This restaurant looks as if it were headed for TriBeCa and took a wrong turn. Floors, walls and ceilings are lined in blond wood, and the mood is quiet and austere. Appetizers include boiled spinach with shaved dried bonito; grilled cod marinated in sake reduction; and steamed asari clam with sake broth.  Soups include shinshu and white miso with fish bone stock; red miso with nameko mushrooms or asari clams; and clear fish broth. Main courses include sashimi and shiitake mushrooms on a bed of sushi rice; freshly grilled dark sea eel on a bed of sushi rice; and squid and clam sashimi on a bed of sushi rice.
