        <p>Clinton Chronicle editor in chief Saundra R Halberstam letter on Jose Maria Conget's August 20 essay notes his neighborhood may not be historic but has been designated Special Clinton District (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I enjoyed Jose Maria Conget's essay ''A Window, a World'' (Aug. 20) and I have a treat for him. He may lament that his neighborhood is ''not a historic district nor a monumental one,'' but it is a special one. From Eighth to Tenth Avenues, spanning 42nd Street to 57th we have the ''Special Clinton District.'' It is because he lived in the Special District, a zoning created in 1974, that the writer had such a wonderful and unobstructed view to the river.</p>
