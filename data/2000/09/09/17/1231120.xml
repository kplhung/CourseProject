        <p>RETURNING from the  Farmers' Market in Hartsdale, I noticed that the strange large van that had been parked at the side of our house for the last two days had moved to the neighbor's driveway. The parents and son were packing so many bags and boxes that it looked like a major move.</p>
        <p>''Oh, he's off to his first year at college,'' I remember. I shout, ''Good luck!'' and the mother replies, ''This is so hard to believe.'' Her words are probably echoing throughout the county. Husbands and wives, mothers and fathers are looking at each other and saying: ''We did it.'' Survived 18 years of very hard work.</p>

        <p>RETURNING from the  Farmers' Market in Hartsdale, I noticed that the strange large van that had been parked at the side of our house for the last two days had moved to the neighbor's driveway. The parents and son were packing so many bags and boxes that it looked like a major move.</p>
        <p>''Oh, he's off to his first year at college,'' I remember. I shout, ''Good luck!'' and the mother replies, ''This is so hard to believe.'' Her words are probably echoing throughout the county. Husbands and wives, mothers and fathers are looking at each other and saying: ''We did it.'' Survived 18 years of very hard work.</p>
        <p>A set of grandparents pull up, no doubt to say goodbye. I watch all of them and their activities for a few minutes and then retreat, realizing it's been 13 years since we were in their shoes, packing and readying our first-born daughter for college.</p>
        <p>It was a great day, full of pride and excitement. She was the first in either of our families to attend an Ivy League school. She was a lively, delightful daughter, and we knew the house would feel very different without her. So melancholy was mixed in with all the upbeat feelings.</p>
        <p>Becoming a family of three instead of four took some getting used to. My husband took it hardest. I found him sitting alone in the kitchen one night, trying to hold back the tears. The sister, who was a freshman in high school at the time, started to spend much more time than ever in her room. When I asked her what was wrong, she said: ''Well, how would you know? Your sister did not go away to college.''</p>
        <p>For a long time I was a mother in denial. Many weeks later, flying to New Orleans on a business trip, I permitted myself to feel the loss, along with pride.</p>
        <p>Three years later, we drove our second-born to college. Both girls phoned home a lot, needed ''stuff'' mailed to them. They were near enough for us to visit on occasional Sundays -- one to the north, the other, the south. My husband and I were good, we thought, at accepting the evolution of family life.</p>
        <p>Until one afternoon when I was working at home. Making myself a cup of coffee about 2:30, I heard a familiar sound -- the chug chug of the school bus climbing the hill to our corner, the driver hitting the gas pedal a little harder, to make it to the top, where the junior high bus has always stopped. I looked out the window at the bright yellow bus and watched the young people tumble out the door, laden with book bags. I wanted one of them to be coming to our door. I wanted to feel the energy and warmth of a nearly grown child coming home after school.</p>
        <p>A few weeks later that same year, I was baking cookies. I liked to send our girls cookies at college. We always had baked together -- chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, gingerbread and sugar cookies. Cookies were the tie that bound our generations, my mother and grandmother, myself and my children. Just as my mother had baked, so did I, and so would they, I hoped.</p>
        <p>''Why don't you just buy cookies from Mrs. Fields and send them?'' my husband asked. I did not expect him to understand, and continued to wrap each cookie individually in wax paper. I felt so alone, realizing our nest was empty, that sharing cookie baking was history.</p>
        <p>Suddenly I wanted not only the school bus to stop but also to hear two girls arguing at the top of the stairs, playing their music too loudly.  I wanted to have to decide what was for dinner, find time to shop for the food and cook. I wanted the return of the many activities that had once seemed a burden. I did not like our empty nest.</p>
        <p>More than a decade has passed since those moments of realization. I think a parent never fully becomes accustomed to the children being gone. We can ask them to come home and clear out their old rooms; we can take over their closets, convert their rooms. But their laughter, tears, sulks, complaints, jubilations insist on resounding through the house, especially during quiet times, like evening, or the lull of midafternoon before the school bus chugs up the hill, or on a summer Saturday afternoon when the neighbors pull out of their driveway to leave with their first-born child for college.</p>
