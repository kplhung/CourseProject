        <p>Wall Street received some good news about inflation last week, but that failed to move investors, who preferred to focus on corporate profits.</p>
        <p>Many major companies are scheduled to report earnings in the next few weeks, and investors are concerned that a slowing economy, higher fuel costs and a weaker euro might hurt profits. Already, some companies, including Maytag and McDonald's, are warning that their earnings will fall below analysts' estimates.</p>
        <p>Company after company is telling us that they're getting squeezed by foreign currencies and higher raw material costs, said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>For the most part, inflation has remained tame since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates several times over the last year. The government reported that consumer prices fell last month for the first time in 14 years, and economists now say that inflation will stay low but that the wild card continues to be energy prices.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 10,927.06, down 293.59 points, while the Nasdaq composite index settled at 3,835.23, down 143.18 points.</p>
