        <p>Strong support in Colorado for ballot initiative to require background checks of those buying guns at shows is among early signs that Gov George W Bush may not win state; latest poll shows Vice Pres Al Gore has erased Bush's big lead; Democrats are investing more capital in state, with visit by Sen Joseph I Lieberman to be followed by visit by Gore's daughter, Kristen, and possible Gore visit (M)</p>

        <p>One of the early signs that Colorado's eight electoral votes may no longer be a sure bet for Mr. Bush is a ballot initiative to require background checks of those buying guns at weekend shows.</p>
        <p>Sponsors collected more than  85,000 signatures supporting the measure, which Republicans have historically opposed as more gun control, and it is expected to win overwhelmingly in November.</p>
        <p>Democrat pollsters have also begun to see enough growing support for Democratic candidates for the State Senate, which Republicans have controlled for 40 years, that Democratic leaders say they believe they can overcome the current five-seat margin.</p>
        <p>Then, said the Democrats' state party chairman, Tim Knaus, Mr. Gore's message on growth, environment, education and the economy began to catch on, and all of a sudden the presidential race in the state  appears to be a dead heat.</p>
        <p>The latest statewide poll, conducted this month for The Rocky Mountain News and KCNC, the CBS affiliate in Denver, found that Mr. Gore had closed the advantage Mr. Bush held in July, 45 percent to 31 percent, to a virtual tie of 43 to 40, with Mr. Gore inside the margin of error of 4 percentage points.</p>
        <p>''That was huge news,'' Mr. Knaus said. ''I was actually taken aback by how much momentum there was. I had been hoping we were within 10 points.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Bill Owens, who is serving as Mr. Bush's state campaign chairman, said he did not believe the poll and pointed to another, conducted by a firm that he and other Colorado Republicans use, that showed Mr. Bush with a lead ''above 10 points.''</p>
        <p>Yet, he conceded: ''The race has obviously narrowed, and Governor Bush has had some difficult weeks. But campaigns run in cycles and after a tough month that left us essentially even, we have a nice base to go back up.''</p>
        <p>Colorado has recently shown an independent streak in presidential elections, supporting Bill Clinton over President Bush in 1992 by 4 percentage points and Bob Dole over Mr. Clinton four years later by 2 points in a race in which third-party candidates won 10 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>But as one measure of the apparent shift back, the Democrats are investing more capital in Colorado, with Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, visiting today, to be followed by Mr. Gore's daughter Kristen next week. And talks are under way to bring in Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Owens said he welcomed the visits. ''I'm confident enough Coloradans will support Governor Bush,'' he said. ''So every dollar they spend here takes it out of states they have a better chance of winning.''</p>
