        <p>Flashman and the Tiger</p>
        <p>By George MacDonald Fraser.</p>
        <p>Knopf, $25.</p>
        <p>In the latest installment of the fictional memoirs of Sir Harry Flashman, ''celebrated Victorian soldier, scoundrel, amorist and self-confessed poltroon,'' the aging antihero saves Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria from an assassination attempt, flees spear-throwing Zulu warriors in Africa and fights a duel in a salt mine. He consorts with various beautiful and mysterious women, exchanges quips with Oscar Wilde (who is ''looking as usual like an overfed trout in a toupee''), investigates a baccarat-cheating scandal at the behest of the Prince of Wales and crosses paths with Sherlock Holmes and Otto von Bismarck, among other luminaries of the Victorian age. But like Forrest Gump, Flashman does little to construct or deserve his extraordinary life. Flashman is a smug, upper-class womanizer who continually and inadvertently stumbles into the middle of momentous historical events, often while pursuing a new mistress. And when Flashman finds himself in danger, as he frequently does, he characteristically behaves like a shameless coward: ''If I've learned one thing in life,'' he says, ''it's to bolt at the first chance and let the future take care of itself.'' And the future does take care of itself. From every scrape, Flashman emerges not only unscathed but with his reputation for gallantry and heroism burnished. This is the central joke and premise of the book, as it is of the 10 previous volumes about the improbably likable Flashman. This new book is light, clever and comical, yet despite all the swashbuckling and sexual antics, despite the celebrity cast of characters and exotic locations, it is also somewhat tedious. Flashman is a caricature, and remains unchanged by his many remarkable experiences. And because he always prevails, his adventures lack not just gravity but also suspense.</p>
