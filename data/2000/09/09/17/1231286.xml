        <p>Red Star in the Bronx</p>
        <p>Q.: I heard that Leon Trotsky once lived in the Bronx. How did it go for him there?</p>
        <p>A.: Not so well at first. In January 1917, Trotsky, his wife, Natalya, and their two sons arrived by ship in New York, which he referred to in a 1930  autobiography, ''My Life,'' as a city of ''capitalist automatism.'' Trotsky, who became Lenin's chief lieutenant in revolutionary Russia, wanted to live in a ''workers district,'' so he  moved his family into an $18-per-month apartment in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Some historians believe that the apartment was at 1522 Vyse Avenue, near 172nd Street, just east of Crotona Park. But Trotsky gave 164th Street as the location (he made no distinction between East and West).</p>

        <p>Red Star in the Bronx</p>
        <p>Q.: I heard that Leon Trotsky once lived in the Bronx. How did it go for him there?</p>
        <p>A.: Not so well at first. In January 1917, Trotsky, his wife, Natalya, and their two sons arrived by ship in New York, which he referred to in a 1930  autobiography, ''My Life,'' as a city of ''capitalist automatism.'' Trotsky, who became Lenin's chief lieutenant in revolutionary Russia, wanted to live in a ''workers district,'' so he  moved his family into an $18-per-month apartment in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Some historians believe that the apartment was at 1522 Vyse Avenue, near 172nd Street, just east of Crotona Park. But Trotsky gave 164th Street as the location (he made no distinction between East and West).</p>
        <p>Before occupying the apartment, Trotsky's wife paid the janitor three months' rent in advance. She received no receipt and upon moving in, Trotsky learned that the janitor had absconded with rent from several tenants. But when he unpacked boxes of belongings that he'd stored in the apartment, Trotsky found his $54 carefully wrapped in paper.</p>
        <p>''He did not mind robbing the landlord, but he was considerate enough not to rob the tenants,'' Trotsky wrote of the janitor. Things got better. Trotsky's sons were won over by the apartment's amenities: electric lights, a gas stove, a bathtub, a telephone and a garbage chute.</p>
        <p>The day he arrived, Trotsky visited the New York Public Library with a Russian editor, Nicolai Bukharin. The next day he began writing for Bukharin's East Village newspaper, Novy Mir. While lecturing in New York, Trotsky discussed politics with Alexandra Kolontay, an expatriate Bolshevik and free-love advocate who informed on Trotsky in letters to  Lenin. He also met Eugene V. Debs, the five-time Socialist candidate for president, whom he described as ''a sincere revolutionary.''</p>
        <p>Trotsky had been in New York only a month when revolutionary uprisings began in Petrograd.</p>
        <p>Soon the red flag was flying over the Winter Palace. Trotsky was anxious to return home and bought his family tickets on the first available ship. On the eve of their departure in March, Trotsky's younger son, Sergei, who was 8 or 9, went for a walk.  He was curious about whether First Street existed, and while searching for it, became lost. Sergei was found by the police, who played checkers with him at a station house until Trotsky's wife showed up.</p>
        <p>In his autobiography, Trotsky said of his departure from New York: ''My only consolation was the thought that I might return. Even now I have not given up that hope.'' Trotsky, who was assassinated in Mexico in 1940, never lived in New York again.</p>
        <p>Turnstile Bumping</p>
        <p>Q.: When I deposit a subway token into a turnstile, there seems to be a momentary pause before the metal arm rotates. Sometimes, while in a rush, I run into the arm before it's ready to turn. Is this just me?</p>
        <p>A.: You are not the only harried commuter to experience a jarring encounter with a turnstile arm. This is what happens: After being deposited, a token goes through two optical sensors on its way down a ramp. A computer judges the dimensions of the token from the time that passage takes. After going through a magnetic sensor, which checks the metallic content, it falls into a chamber in which it is weighed against a test token. Only after this process, which takes about a second, is the turnstile arm allowed to revolve.</p>
        <p>As a result, ''getting karate-chopped in the gut by a turnstile is not an infrequent occurence,'' said Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group. He said he had never heard of a serious injury caused by a collision with a turnstile arm, but said such run-ins can be embarrassing.</p>
        <p>''We're in a big hurry in New York,'' he said. ''But people generally cope with the turnstile pause by developing a sense of timing.''</p>
