        <p>IN a huge, white space not far from the meatpacking district, Damien Hirst was up to his eyeballs on Thursday evening, setting up his first major art show in four years. The eyeballs, which were a crucial part of two pieces, had not yet been installed, but they will be fully operational before Mr. Hirst's show opens at Larry Gagosian's new Chelsea gallery this week. Despite Mr. Hirst's propensity for animal body parts in his work (bisected cows suspended in formaldehyde and whatnot), the eyeballs in question were not real but mere Ping-Pong balls.</p>
        <p>Not that Mr. Hirst has lost his macabre sensibility. Perched on the edge of a huge wooden crate, the artist, who splits his time between Devonshire and London, explained that the fake eyeballs will bounce off jet streams projected through the sockets of a human skeleton in a piece called ''Death Is Irrelevant'' and a skull in another called ''Skullduggery.''</p>

        <p>IN a huge, white space not far from the meatpacking district, Damien Hirst was up to his eyeballs on Thursday evening, setting up his first major art show in four years. The eyeballs, which were a crucial part of two pieces, had not yet been installed, but they will be fully operational before Mr. Hirst's show opens at Larry Gagosian's new Chelsea gallery this week. Despite Mr. Hirst's propensity for animal body parts in his work (bisected cows suspended in formaldehyde and whatnot), the eyeballs in question were not real but mere Ping-Pong balls.</p>
        <p>Not that Mr. Hirst has lost his macabre sensibility. Perched on the edge of a huge wooden crate, the artist, who splits his time between Devonshire and London, explained that the fake eyeballs will bounce off jet streams projected through the sockets of a human skeleton in a piece called ''Death Is Irrelevant'' and a skull in another called ''Skullduggery.''</p>
        <p>''They pop out kind of like Roger Rabbit,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>For an artist who made his name 10 years ago by displaying maggots and a rotting cow's head, Mr. Hirst looks almost tame. Wearing a crisp white shirt and Joe Boxer jeans, he got back to work, discussing lighting with his art installer, Graham Stewart. Around them were unopened crates, labeled ''Fragile,'' and ''Protect From Elements.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirst is now a family man: his wife, Maia, a jewelry designer, and two sons, Connor, 5, and Cassius, 5 months, were arriving the next day. He took a drag on his cigarette and gave a mini-tour of the work in progress before catching up with his New York friends for dinner.</p>
        <p>''This is my first show without any formaldehyde,'' Mr. Hirst observed. To the artist's right, an enormous glass cube was filled to the brim with water. Brightly colored African river fish swam around a gynecologist's chair and a trolley covered with nasty, gleaming surgical instruments.</p>
        <p>In another room, a large glass vitrine was occupied by an eerily lifelike robot dressed in lab clothes. Its chest rose and fell convincingly, as its fingers turned the knob of a microscope. What was it examining so intently?</p>
        <p>''Blood,'' Mr. Hirst said.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of the show will be a 20-foot-high, seven-ton painted bronze anatomical model called ''Hymn,'' based on a child's toy.</p>
        <p>With titles like ''From the Cradle to the Grave'' and ''An Unreasonable Fear of Death and Dying,'' the nearly two dozen new works in the show reflect Mr. Hirst's obsession with the moribund.</p>
        <p>He sees it slightly differently. ''I think it's a preoccupation with life really,'' he said. ''Society sweeps death under the carpet. In order to live, you have to sweep it out. It's the single most important fact of life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirst's tour was interrupted by a surprise visit from his fellow-artist David Salle, who dropped by unannounced to check out the new space, where he will have the next show. The artists shook hands. ''Do you play golf?'' Mr. Salle asked.</p>
        <p>''No, snooker,'' Mr. Hirst replied.</p>
        <p>Just then, Mr. Hirst's cell phone echoed in the cavernous space. ''Who? Da Silvano? Ten? O.K.,'' he said, walking out of the gallery toward a cab with his assistant. By 9:30, Mr. Hirst was on the terrace outside his penthouse suite at the SoHo Grand, before reconnoitering with Nicholas Graham, the owner of Joe Boxer, and a dozen other friends. He looked up at the full moon.</p>
        <p>''We're going to get in trouble tonight then,'' he said. Taking a last sip of his vodka tonic, Mr. Hirst headed off to dinner. ''I love jokes,'' the artist said in parting. ''Want to hear one? I'm worried about my work. I think I'm flogging a dead horse.''</p>
