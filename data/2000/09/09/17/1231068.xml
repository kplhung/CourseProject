        <p>AS I made my way through ''The Chief,'' David Nasaw's new life of William Randolph Hearst, a premonition crept up on me. This long, careful book was loaded with shot that might carry further than Mr. Nasaw intended. I could not place the feeling at first, or see how so reasonable and persuasive a narrative was setting off such large creaks and groans within me. But then the prospect dawned -- that the election itself might be affected -- and I began to feel hopeful.</p>
        <p>No, I do not mean Bush and Gore. Still, if history runs to script, then Sight and Sound, the magazine of the British Film Institute, some time early in 2002, will publish its sixth once-a-decade poll on the movies that critics and filmmakers think of as the best ever. Does that poll matter? Only to the extent that Sight and Sound is the oldest serious film magazine in English, and because it has carefully nursed its poll to cover a wide range of voters. There is also the point that its winner chimes with just about every other poll ever taken. A year and a half ahead of polling, ''Citizen Kane'' is a Tiger Woods favorite to retain the title it first won in 1962.</p>
        <p>Now, please read the following with care: I love ''Citizen Kane''; I have been on record for several decades as its ardent admirer. I would not dispute anyone who, in 2002, says again that it is the best film ever made -- if it really reassures us to have such a ranking. Yet I believe that it would be for the good of film history, for watching movies, for the always tenuous notion of film as an art, and especially for ''Citizen Kane,'' if the film could be spared from running, have its number hoist up in the rafters of the old Boston Garden, whatever. That allows ''Citizen Kane'' a chance of becoming something other than the Ozymandian monument lording it over the surrounding desert.</p>
        <p>Now, Sight and Sound itself could find the wisdom to forgo its poll -- yet I suspect that that is as unlikely as getting the Academy to do without its March prize-giving. ''Citizen Kane'' could be gently omitted from the vote -- but how does wisdom then surmount the plaints about unfairness? I might remind Sight and Sound that in 1952, when it began this game, ''Citizen Kane'' was nowhere to be seen. In that poll, the top 10 were ''The Bicycle Thief,''  ''City Lights'' and ''The Gold Rush'' (tied for second); ''Battleship Potemkin''; ''Louisiana Story'' and ''Intolerance'' (tied for fifth); ''Greed''; ''Le Jour se Leve'' and ''The Passion of Joan of Arc'' (tied for seventh); and ''Brief Encounter,''  ''Le Million'' and ''Rules of the Game'' (tied for tenth).</p>
        <p>That list deserves some comment: could we all agree by 2002 that De Sica's film ought to be called ''Bicycle Thieves''? The Italian title, ''Ladri di Biciclette,'' takes the plural; part of the point of the movie is that theft is infectious -- it breeds more thieves. Elsewhere, the 1952 poll is a warning to all list-makers that you end up whistling in tomorrow's dark. There are films here that many of today's young people will not know. And I began to wonder whether -- like Communism itself, so big once, so un-cool now -- ''Battleship Potemkin'' didn't need explanation.</p>
        <p>But ''Citizen Kane'' was a great film in 1952 -- wasn't it? And Orson Welles had not vanished: his film of ''Othello'' would win the Palme d'Or, the top prize, at Cannes that year. But ''Kane'' did not dominate then. After the film's critical success and commercial failure in 1941, it became hard to find. Very few ''old'' films were revived in those days. Movie theaters were crowded out with brand new pictures. There was neither time nor space for reconsideration (and there was little use of the repertory of old films on television). There was, especially in Europe, a film society tradition that depended on films like ''Potemkin,'' Dreyer's ''Joan of Arc'' and ''Le Jour se Leve'' -- ''old,'' yet treasured, and available in 16-millimeter prints.</p>
        <p>Such innocence did not last. In the 1950's ''Citizen Kane'' began to be shown on television; it reappeared in fine 35-millimeter prints at revival houses; and Orson Welles delivered ''Mr. Arkadin'' (which is a kind of weekend house-party remake of ''Kane'') and ''Touch of Evil'' (which was a Sight and Sound runner-up in 1992). The young French hailed Orson: in Truffaut's 1973 ''Day for Night,'' the director dreams of Kane. By 1962, Sight and Sound was in no doubt: ''Citizen Kane'' headed the top ten that also had ''L'Avventura,''  ''Rules of the Game'', ''Greed,''  ''Ugetsu Monogatari'' (look it up!), ''Potemkin,''  ''The Bicycle Thief,'' ''Ivan the Terrible,''  ''La Terra Trema'' and ''L'Atalante.''</p>
        <p>''Kane'' held its place in 1972, 1982 and 1992, when, allowing for a few ties, the top films were ''Citizen Kane,''  ''Rules of the Game,''  ''Tokyo Story,''  ''Vertigo,''  ''L'Atalante,''  ''Raging Bull,''  ''The Searchers,''  ''2001,''  ''The Passion of Joan of Arc,''  ''The Godfather'' (just the first part), ''8 1/2,''  ''Seven Samurai,''  ''Pather Panchali,''  ''Modern Times'' and ''La Strada.''  ''Rules of the Game'' had 39 votes, while ''Kane'' had 73.</p>
        <p>It's hard to imagine that ''Citizen Kane,'' or Welles, have lost support in the last 10 years. Three biographical studies have been published in that time, one of them Peter Bogdanovich's extensive interview with Welles. ''Touch of Evil'' has been revived in something supposedly closer to Welles's intent. Documentary material from his South American jaunt, ''It's All True,'' was released; a new cache of Welles material has come to light. Welles died in 1985, but he feels more present than ever -- and there is still most of a full-length feature, ''The Other Side of the Wind,'' shot over a long period of time until his death, that may or may not get a release.</p>
        <p>Welles hangs over us -- as a martyr, an example and a variously booming and seductive voice. He's more than ordinary or common. (A stage biography of Welles, ''War of the Worlds,'' by the avant-garde director Anne Bogart will be part of the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music next month.) What I had tried to do in my own book about Welles (''Rosebud: The Story of Orson Welles'') was reclaim the actual man, showing the flaws, tricks and evasions as well as the greatness. When ''The Chief'' was published, some reviews spoke of William Randolph Hearst at last emerging from behind the dazzling light of Charles Foster Kane. I think they're correct; and, in turn, I think this helps us see Kane more fully or clearly. Mr. Nasaw makes Hearst a regular guy (as well as extraordinary) and often likable or sympathetic, if far from a universal hero. The ordinariness is the greatest coup, for it helps teach us how profoundly unalike Hearst and Kane were. And that's the crucial step toward grasping the inner bond between Kane and George Orson Welles.</p>
        <p>This is not a revisionist approach: it does not take away from the scope of ''Citizen Kane'' -- the way it is about America, its power and media, as much as it is about this one figure. What I am suggesting is that even in his early 20's, Welles had a sharper understanding of America than Hearst possessed, and a more needy idea of how he might fit in. The people close to Welles in the early 1940's were staggered at his talent; it was their chief reason for enduring his ordinary defects. It was not absurd then to think that he might move on, beyond show business and into that ''higher'' field that is compared with theater and performance throughout his great movie.</p>
        <p>Better than he or she knows ''Ugetsu Monogatari'' or ''Greed,'' maybe, the ordinary viewer ''knows'' the teasing masquerade whereby ''Citizen Kane'' was a film about William Randolph Hearst, a cross between satire and lampoon (with a dash of very intimate cruelty), such as was always bound to incur the mogul's wrath and rebuke and make Welles's future uncomfortable. I don't seek to deny the elementary equation between Susan Kane and Marion Davies (Hearst's West coast mistress), or Xanadu and San Simeon (Hearst's castle south of the Big Sur coast).</p>
        <p>It's much more important to note the genetic distance between Hearst and Kane -- and that's where Mr. Nasaw's book is so instructive. Hearst was never the dark, fallen angel making ironic observations about himself that is Welles's Kane. Hearst was silly, sentimental, muddled. He loved his wife and mistress -- whereas Kane hardly noticed a woman. Hearst wanted both, and was friendly, loyal and kind to both. He was, to be sure, a master of the media who had passing delusions of grandeur, and who did some petty damage to history and public understanding. Some of his remarks fall from Kane's lips. But he never had the confidence, the angel's flight, to say as Kane did, finishing off his first wife's line, ''The people will think -- what I tell them to think.'</p>
        <p>HEARST was not a character, bent upon the giddy, lens-stretching spatial dislocation of Xanadu, or its narcissistic ''caves of ice.'' San Simeon was a vanity, if you will, but it was handsome and a delight -- it still is. Julia Morgan, the architect he hired and largely trusted, did wonders there, and you can still feel the great confidence and good will of Californian success -- without disapproval, or promise of comeuppance. And Hearst enjoyed the place, just as he loved Marion to the end. He also worked hard when he was in his 80's, instead of sitting in the dark splendor, contemplating what his last word should be. He was never that much of a tyrant.</p>
        <p>David Nasaw stresses the contradictions in Hearst -- ''William Randolph Hearst was a huge man with a tiny voice'' are the writer's very first words. Yet Orson Welles was already famous for one of the greatest voices of the 1930's. It was a voice for poetry and promotion, for alarming the nation with ''The War of the Worlds'' or resonating with the secret insights of ''The Shadow.'' It was a great voice, but one so sure of itself that the streak of charlatanism could hardly be excluded. And just as ''Citizen Kane'' is a picture that takes sound as seriously as sights, so it is obsessed with the pattern of speech and applause, oration and manipulation. It hears in Orson Welles's voice astonishing, rapturous conviction, and the urge that may sweep a speaker off his flat feet. To this day, there is hardly a movie anywhere that so asks us to distinguish bombast from sincerity. All of that came from people who couldn't get Orson's tricky voice out of their heads. A ''Kane'' with Hearst's voice would not have worked: that great man supplies his own ridicule and humiliation. Yet Hearst did his best, and talked away for 80 years. He was grand but he was a chump at the same time.</p>
        <p>The process that made ''Kane'' -- from screenwriting to finished film -- was entranced with Welles's voice, yet waiting for betrayal. ''The Chief's'' faith in contradictions helps redirect us toward the terrible, inhuman unity of ''Citizen Kane,'' and the way in which it was derived from and written for Welles. I do not want to refight the old battle Pauline Kael began over authorship. Rather, I suggest that Herman Mankiewicz (with John Houseman at his side) wrote a script that was a cunning challenge to Welles. It said: Look, Orson, the world will think this is Hearst. But you and I know it is you -- with your great voice, your raging beauty, your notorious genius, your animal energy, your little boy vanity, your royal arrogance and that selfishness that permits you no other exit except self-destruction. So here it is, Orson, my gift to you. And Welles read and understood and accepted the challenge.</p>
        <p>The parenthetical about Houseman is vital. When Mankiewicz was hired to write what they were still calling ''American'' then, he was a perilously reformed alcoholic. So he was sent up to a ranch north of Los Angeles to do the work, to stay on the wagon, and Houseman was sent with him. No one knew Welles better, loved his talent more, or was more wary of his fickle nature. No one could be so helpful in recalling anecdotes to inspire Mankiewicz -- who had already fallen into many of Houseman's opinions about the great boy, and who was only confirmed in them when Welles later tried to reduce his credit for writing the thing.</p>
        <p>I believe -- and have argued before -- that you can feel the evidence, as if it were Welles's pushing ego, when you're in the dark with the film. And San Simeon was a place where people had a good time -- so very far from the Xanadu that is in awe of Kane's gloom and inertia. When you recall the solemnity of Kane's death, it may be worth knowing that Hearst died, as most significant people die, in a crowded house. Indeed, Marion Davies -- who loved him beyond the end -- was distraught that he had no peace. Whereas Orson Welles died in a small house in Los Angeles absolutely alone.</p>
        <p>I urge this view of Welles and Kane not out of hostility to Welles. I hope it comes closer to the heart of this mysterious film, without seeming to explain it away. But I think the movie is about a grim, lonely egotism, and Welles was its model, not Hearst.</p>
        <p>Does that make such a difference? For one thing, it helps challenge the orthodoxy that ''Citizen Kane'' is as much about America, its politics, its view of success and happiness, as it is about one haunted man. And it's that legend of the personal and the political in harness that does so much to prolong the reign of ''Citizen Kane'' as our best and most important film.</p>
        <p>The legend makes it easier for young people to write ''Kane'' off, to bow as they enter its church, but then pass on in defiance. For it's not good for an art or a medium still young that the great work should be so much of the past. It fosters the anxiety that the cinema is in decline. And just because no American film has matched ''Kane,'' so we are deterred from seeing how works from Europe or Asia may be the most likely rivals.</p>
        <p>I suspect that people coming to the movies now feel daunted by ''Citizen Kane'' -- I felt that way once toward ''Battleship Potemkin,'' and could  see or feel only how distant it was from my culture. Kids in love with movies want to believe that theirs is the golden age, and so you hear youthful tributes to ''Jaws'' and ''Star Wars'' and ''E.T.'' and ''Titanic'' as the greatest ever made instead of just the biggest bonanza.</p>
        <p>Equally, at a time when young Americans seem resentful if asked to watch foreign films, the claims of Renoir, Ophuls, Antonioni, Mizoguchi, Rivette and Bunuel may fade, just as too many people have hardly heard of Angelopoulos, Kiarostama, Hou Hsiao-Hsien or Chris Marker.</p>
        <p>I mention that great documentary-maker because, when Mr. Marker was polled in 1992, he declined to play the game (he did slip in one name, ''Vertigo''). But a filmmaker that wise could feel ashamed of the movies' remorseless need for champions. We are not battered with league standings for the best painting, the most relevant symphony, the novel to take to a desert island. Could there be some uneasiness in us as to whether films are really important, or self-important?</p>
        <p>Put it all together, and I feel inclined to resist the automatic claims of ''Citizen Kane'' once again. And it seems to me valuable to note how that film is the project of a unique self-centeredness. That is not an attack on Orson Welles, just an attempt to measure him.</p>
        <p>Do I expect to see ''Kane'' exempted from the polls? Is my tongue close to my cheek? Well, yes and no. I hope that the British Film Institute and voters will see the full context. Some abstentions would be healthy; they would give the future a better chance. On the other hand, even if some rule were passed that took ''Citizen Kane'' out of the reckoning, that might merely add to the likelihood of many of us voting for ''The Magnificent Ambersons.''</p>
