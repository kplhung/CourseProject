        <p>Talk about hitting close to home. Wasserstein Perella &amp; Company, the investment boutique started by the deal makers Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella in the late 1980's, is in talks to be acquired by Dresdner Bank of Germany. Wasserstein's headquarters, however, are at 31 West 52nd Street, the home of Deutsche Bank's offices here. Deutsche is not only a Dresdner competitor, but it failed in its own attempt to merge with Dresdner earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Wasserstein already had plans to move to the Avenue of the Americas this fall. This time the flavor is French. The building is the New York headquarters of Credit Lyonnais.</p>
