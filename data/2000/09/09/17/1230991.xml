        <p>With the exception of Michael Lewis's quirky ''New New Thing,'' a keyhole glimpse into the workings of Silicon Valley, the last few years have not produced an abundance of memorable nonfiction narratives set in corporate America. Among those who have attempted the genre, there's been some debate why. It's true the world of balance sheets and stock charts hasn't exactly been a magnet for the most creative and inspired writers of the generation. But there's also a sense that the genre itself may be limited: once readers have embraced one good book on an uproarious takeover battle, a vicious proxy fight, a tale of Hollywood excess, a high-tech startup or an insider-trading scandal, it hasn't been shown that they're left hungering for more. Clearly, new areas of corporate behavior need to be explored. Even so, who would have thought the next great business book would emerge from that most banal of economic crimes, price fixing?</p>
        <p>The book is Kurt Eichenwald's ''Informant,'' and it chronicles the mid-1990's price-fixing scandal at the Archer Daniels Midland Company, the politically connected Illinois maker of feed and grain additives perhaps best known for its ''Supermarket to the World'' commercials. Eichenwald, a reporter for The New York Times, has written what may be the best business narrative since the early 1980's, the heyday of books like David McClintick's ''Indecent Exposure'' and Ken Auletta's ''Greed and Glory on Wall Street.''</p>
        <p>In ''The Informant'' Eichenwald poses the unlikely question: What happens when a government informant at the heart of a global criminal conspiracy turns out to be a bipolar, serial-lying embezzler? Such questions should draw authors like flies, and indeed, ''The Informant'' is one of two new books on the ADM scandal. The other is ''Rats in the Grain,'' by James B. Lieber. Lieber, the author of ''Friendly Takeover: How an Employee Buyout Saved a Steel Town,'' is a lawyer and unfortunately writes like it. Worse, he chooses to tell the story of ADM by focusing on the trial of two of its executives, which is a bit like telling the story of the Titanic by focusing on the inquest.</p>
        <p>Eichenwald focuses instead on Mark Whitacre, the peppy scientist in his 30's who headed the ADM division that makes, among other things, a chemical called lysine, which is used to fatten chickens. It was Whitacre who first alerted the F.B.I. to meetings ADM was having with its Japanese and South Korean competitors to agree upon the price and amount of lysine they would each produce. These agreements, illegal under United States law, artificially propped up lysine prices, cheating chicken growers like Tyson Foods and driving up the costs of things like Chicken McNuggets.</p>
        <p>For two years Whitacre wore F.B.I. wires during these meetings, and the tapes of what took place are among the most anger-inducing examples of corporate misbehavior ever put on a page. In meetings set at palmy country clubs and Hawaiian golf resorts, American executives who are being paid millions of dollars openly plot to rip off consumers. Along the way, Whitacre's microphones record jaw-dropping illustrations of the locker-room attitudes pervading ADM's executive suites, including the graphic speculations of the company's vice chairman, Michael Andreas, son of ADM's powerful chairman Dwayne Andreas, as to the bedroom talents of ADM secretaries and female executives.</p>
        <p>The book is replete with examples of corporate misbehavior of a kind that is often rumored but seldom documented. A Japanese executive, given a tour of ADM's lysine plant, wipes a handkerchief along a railing, hoping to steal a stray microbe that could reveal the secret behind ADM's lysine-producing bacteria. ADM allegedly hires prostitutes to seduce a competitor's executives in hopes that pillow talk might reveal proprietary business data -- a premise as silly as the tactic would be abhorrent.</p>
        <p>But Whitacre's involvement in ADM's illegal behavior is only the starting point for a story that time and again had me turning to my wife and saying things like ''No way!'' and ''You've got to read this.'' Because while the price-fixing scandal is very real, almost everything else about Whitacre turns out to be a lie. Like so many confidential informants, Whitacre is left deeply corrupted by his brushes with corruption: In Whitacre's case, the crime that the the F.B.I. ultimately uncovers is a multimillion-dollar embezzlement scheme so brazen, so cinematic, that it leaves ADM private detectives speculating that he was attempting to live out a John Grisham novel (they had ''The Firm'' in mind).</p>
        <p>When all this first spooled out onto business pages several years ago, the ADM scandal was hopelessly confusing. (Attempting to explain his stealing, for instance, Whitacre claimed that kickbacks and the illegal use of Swiss bank accounts were accepted within the upper reaches of ADM as a sort of unofficial bonus system.) But in Eichenwald's hands the story emerges as linear and wholly transparent. What makes ''The Informant'' so powerful is Eichenwald's decision to tell the story through the eyes of the F.B.I. agents and lawyers whose cases -- and careers -- depend on Whitacre's trustworthiness. In the first 150 pages, the reader learns a series of crucial facts about Whitacre, including his involvement in an extortion attempt by a Japanese executive who has sabotaged the bacteria used in ADM's lysine plant. But as in a good movie, nothing is as it seems, and the reader discovers this only as the thunderstruck F.B.I. agents and government attorneys slowly peel back each layer of Whitacre's lies.</p>
        <p>Not that Whitacre's viewpoint is discounted -- far from it. There are touching scenes, some in bed at night, in which his wife Ginger attempts to fathom her husband's strange new life as an F.B.I. informant. There are glimpses of the predictable stresses he endures, as well as genuinely wacky moments when Whitacre inexplicably brags of his undercover talents to some of the very people he should be investigating. In one scene, Whitaker shows his gardener -- his gardener! -- an F.B.I. briefcase in which a tape recorder is hidden. ''Just start calling me 014,'' Whitacre boasts. ''Because I'm twice as smart as 007.''</p>
        <p>Time and again Whitacre's secret is almost uncovered. At a key price-fixing meeting, to cite just one example, executives from ADM and its Asian competitors are joking about the possibility that their schemes will be uncovered by the Federal Trade Commission. When there comes a knock on the meeting-room door, a Japanese executive jokes, ''It's the F.T.C.'' It is in fact the F.B.I., as an agent disguised as a room-service waiter appears and slips Whitacre a new tape recorder. His had broken.</p>
        <p>Whitacre's downward spiral inevitably draws comparisons to that of Jeffrey Wigand, the whistle-blowing scientist at Brown &amp; Williamson, the tobacco company whose story was portrayed in last year's movie ''The Insider.'' Under attack from the industry for his role, Wigand saw his life implode. His wife left him. He lost his job. But as a dramatic character Wigand is stale bread when compared to the volatile Whitacre, whose self-inflicted fall features multiple suicide attempts and, ultimately, prison. Wigand was trying to do the right thing. Whitacre was nuts.</p>
        <p>In less capable hands the byzantine plot of ''The Informant'' might be confusing. But Eichenwald, whose first book, ''Serpent on the Rock,'' was a promising if uninspired investigation of Prudential Securities, keeps things clear and concise. There is dialogue aplenty, much of it lifted from F.B.I. tapes and reports. Every scene is set; the book has a wonderful sense of place, especially on the nights Whitacre races around Decatur, ADM's little hometown, meeting with F.B.I. agents at Best Western hotels and Olive Garden restaurants. The writing is lean, spare and without pretense.</p>
        <p>''The Informant'' is not without its faults. When its focus strays from Whitacre the pace slows, here and there bogging down in tangents involving dozens of interchangeable minor players, mostly lawyers. The last 50 or so pages meander, as Eichenwald is obliged to tie up a mop's worth of loose ends. And despite its wealth of sources -- every major character has clearly spent hours in front of Eichenwald's tape recorder -- he is never able to bring Dwayne Andreas himself into sharp focus, nor does he adequately address Andreas's culpability in the scandals that led to his retirement.</p>
        <p>But the oddest omission is a comprehensive analysis of Whitacre himself. The man is emotionally unstable and prone to bouts of mental illness, apparently resulting from what his psychologist diagnoses as a bipolar disorder. There is a wonderful ''Rosebud'' moment toward the end of the book where the reader finally learns the unlikely -- and appropriately exotic -- event that propelled Whitacre toward his snowballing series of falsehoods. But nowhere does Eichenwald tackle the difficult job of attempting to explain Whitacre. Over and over F.B.I. agents and prosecutors ask why Whitacre, whose income is in the million-dollar-a-year range, is working with them. Whitacre himself is no help; he rationalizes that his undercover work will lead ADM's board of directors to fire upper management and elevate him to chief executive officer. Other than this bit of delusion, a satisfactory explanation for Whitacre's behavior is never offered.</p>
        <p>Like so many reporters-turned-author, Eichenwald is reluctant to enter the marshy ground of analysis and instead chooses to let his facts do the talking. Yet key facts are left unexplored. There is no section in the book that delves into Whitacre's life before ADM, where light could presumably be shed on any precursors to his behavior at ADM. Did he tape the other ninth graders? Demand kickbacks on his paper route? The few tantalizing clues suggest that Eichenwald missed the chance to put his subject's behavior in its fullest context. Still, rarely are episodes of corporate misbehavior rendered as unvarnished as those in ''The Informant.'' It ranks with ''A Civil Action'' as one of the best nonfiction books of the last decade.</p>
        <p>''Rats in the Grain'' tells much the same story, but forsakes human drama in favor of legal analysis framed by the trial of Michael Andreas and another ADM executive, a matter ''The Informant'' relegates to its epilogue. Lieber marches through the trial witness by witness, quoting liberally and incorporating trial transcripts, even tossing in the judge's comments.</p>
        <p>Given the richness of Eichenwald's narrative, Lieber's decision to focus on the trial is a bewildering one. Even a murder trial is rarely riveting unto itself: a price-fixing trial is about as exciting as it sounds. Worse, Lieber at times seems to go out of his way to expunge the record of color. Rather than quoting from one of Michael Andreas's earthy soliloquies on ADM women, for instance, Lieber describes one such incident this way: ''On the way back to Decatur, the high jinks again included discussing women in the office. The discussion was interesting on a number of levels. It showed the personal corruption of patriarchal power at ADM, where no female ever has penetrated the inner circle, a white male bastion, and where women were viewed as toys.''</p>
        <p>Rigorous and fact-filled, ''Rats in the Grain,'' with some 90 pages of notes, lists and tabular matter, reads and feels like a textbook or a Congressional report. It should be of interest primarily to antitrust lawyers.</p>
