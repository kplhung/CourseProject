        <p>Against a tide of gaudy international discotheques, the traditional Irish pub has no problem holding its own in Dublin. Historic watering holes and polished nightclubs are learning to live side by side.</p>
        <p>For a hip, young European capital, though, the standard of high-fashion night life still falls far shy of London or Paris. But even on the slowest of nights, there's never a  problem finding the unremitting buzz of laughter and conversation -- and a well-poured pint of Guinness.</p>
        <p>You'll rarely have to walk more than 20 minutes to get anywhere in Dublin's compact center. And it's just as well: public transportation and taxis are hard to come by. Dress at clubs is almost uniformly casual. A growing number of bars and clubs now have a no-sneakers rule, the only strict requirement.</p>
        <p>A fixture in the traditional pub establishment, Kehoe's Bar and Lounge maintains an intimate air in one of Dublin's busiest areas, just off Grafton Street. It's just as much home to Irish Times journalists as it is to cell phone addicts in four-button suits. Recently, I couldn't help but get dragged into a conversation by locals complaining about rip-off real estate prices.</p>
        <p>The decor hasn't changed much in a generation or so, as evidenced by scarred hardwood floors, high mirrors behind the bar and running boards to hold pint glasses and tired elbows. Several small rooms, or snugs, create a conspiratorial atmosphere. The coziest snug in Kehoe's -- with effort, six people can squeeze in -- was previously the women's bathroom, now outfitted with red-cushioned benches.</p>
        <p>On warm summer nights, the crowd at Kehoe's spills out onto the sidewalk, and seats on the curb are as contested as stools at the bar.</p>
        <p>A smaller crowd turned out recently at Vicar Street, a music hall and bar in the Liberties area, to hear the Latin jazz master Pucho. A Harlem native who revived a salsa-funk sound in 90's England, he appeared with a nine-piece horn-and-percussion ensemble that kept the audience dancing throughout the show (the cover charge was slightly more than usual, about $15, at the rate of $1.15 to the punt).</p>
        <p>For more-highbrow jazz acts, like the Mingus Big Band and Brad Mehldau, both of whom played at Vicar Street recently, tables and stools fill the dance floor.</p>
        <p>The attentive staff of Vicar Street wouldn't feel at home in Switch, a basement nightclub that stands out in sharp relief against the increasingly tourist-dominated Temple Bar area. Floor-level speakers in four corners barrage the packed dance floor, while glowing cigarettes glimmer from couches in the shadows. Camouflage netting hangs from the ceiling and the walls, adding to the grungy feel. Most Fridays feature drum and bass by the local D.J. crew Bassbin; the rest of the week ranges from hard techno to deep house.</p>
        <p>A word on the pace of the evening: drinking starts much earlier than in other European countries. Many Dubliners down their first pint after work about 6:30 and continue straight through until midnight, when bars stop serving alcohol. Nightclubs and specially licensed late bars serve until around 3 a.m.</p>
