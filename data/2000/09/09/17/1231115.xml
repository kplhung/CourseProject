        <p>LONG ISLAND business travelers are increasingly choosing MacArthur Airport in Islip over La Guardia, Kennedy or Newark, opting for convenience over frequent flights. Passenger traffic through newly renovated MacArthur is expected to reach two and a half million this year, up from less than two million last year. The growth reflects the robust local economy and the national upsurge in business travel.</p>
        <p>Still, many business travelers prefer to arrive at Kennedy, La Guardia or Newark, do business on Long Island, and then return to an airport hotel or to Manhattan at the end of the day. They represent a market Long Island hotels have largely ignored so far. But that, too, may change, as the first of a planned 3,000 new hotel rooms are completed this fall, and as new hotels, most along east-west arteries, continue to open in the next four or five years.</p>
        <p>The Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau says that most of those the new hotel rooms, about 7 out of 10, will be marketed to business travelers.</p>
        <p>Economic conditions are driving the surge in business travel and accommodations. ''Long Island technology is exploding right now, and more people around the country are doing business on Long Island,'' said  Joseph Cosgrove, the executive vice president of the Coronado Travel Group in Roslyn, which specializes in business travel. ''There haven't been enough hotel rooms to accommodate them all.''</p>
        <p>That will soon change as the new business-oriented hotels put out their welcome mats. Forgoing amenities like on-site restaurants, bars and room service, such hotels typically offer other features instead: in-room Internet hookups, fax service and multiple telephone lines.</p>
        <p>Those are the sort of services offered by the 130-room Wingate Inn, which opened last winter in Garden City. By catering to business travelers, its occupancy rate quickly rose to 87 percent.</p>
        <p>''For a long time it's been very difficult to open a new hotel in Nassau County, and as a result, business travelers couldn't find the accommodations they got in other markets,'' said Alan Fairbairn, a partner in the Garden City Wingate. ''We anticipated that  people were coming into Nassau to do business that would book rooms in a new hotel that had the right features. We put in those features, and it turned out we were right.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fairbairn, who teaches hospitality management at the New York Institute of Technology in Central Islip, said: ''People  used to come to Long Island for business through La Guardia or Kennedy airports. Obviously, they still do. But more and more they're coming through MacArthur and want to stay within a few miles of where they're working.''</p>
        <p>John Tsunis, the managing partner in Long Island Hotels, is putting up two hotels near the Long Island Expressway and has the business market as his target: a 136-room Holiday Inn Express at Exit 56, near Hauppauge, and a 160-room Hampton Inn at Exit 63, near Holtsville. The first is scheduled to open in December, the second next  spring. Although neither hotel will have food and beverage service, both will have exercise and meeting rooms.</p>
        <p>''Two international corporations are headquartered within a few miles of each other on the L.I.E.,'' said Mr. Tsunis, who was referring to Computer Associates and Symbol Technologies. ''They drive business and create an enormous ripple effect.''</p>
        <p>Much of the surge in business travel is coming through MacArthur Airport. Its growth -- more gates and flights -- represents a convenient bonanza to business travelers. It's estimated that half the passengers at MacArthur are on business.</p>
        <p>That represents a sea change for the airport, which had been run by the Town of Islip primarily as a convenience for residents. Until well into the 1980's, amenities were few: passengers collected their luggage on  the sidewalk outside the terminal, for example. A $14 million face lift, completed earlier this year, added more parking and renovated the terminal but did not improve access to public transportation.</p>
        <p>''When the airport was renovated, there was talk of relocating the terminal to the north end,'' said Charles Baldassano, the Ronkonkoma architect who handled the project. Rather than moving the terminal, which would have put it about two miles from the Long Island Rail Road's Ronkonkama station, the town board voted to expand parking, to about 3,000 spaces. ''The sense I got,'' said Mr. Baldassano, ''was 'Keep it local.' ''</p>
        <p>That became problematic in March 1999 when Southwest Airlines announced the that it would begin low-fare service from MacArthur to Chicago, Washington and several other cities. The budget airline continues to increase its service, most recently adding a $49 one-way flight to Providence, R.I. Other airlines have since added flights or lowered prices, a phenomenon the airline industry calls the Southwest Effect.</p>
        <p>Many business travelers say MacArthur  became a business airport the day Southwest arrived. Now, about a third of all the airport's passengers fly on Southwest, the airline said.</p>
        <p>Gary Quinn, the executive vice president of Computer Associates who oversees corporate travel, said, ''You take a look at the parking lot in MacArthur, and you see how  crowded it is.'' About 6,400 Computer Associates employees will fly out of MacArthur this year, up nearly a quarter from last year's total. That increase reflects both the company's business expansion and changing individual preferences, Mr. Quinn said.</p>
        <p>''If you've ever flown into Kennedy or La Guardia and dealt with the congestion and the traffic and airline personnel, then it's no mystery why people would rather fly out of Islip,'' Mr. Quinn said.</p>
        <p>Still, many business travelers prefer to use Kennedy, La Guardia or Newark and hotels near those airports or in Manhattan.  ''New York metro airports are widely known and utilized, compared to what's  available on Long Island,'' said Robert Mann, an airline consultant based in Port Washington. Lingering concerns about frequency of service and airlines' commitments to the market also deter use, he said. With infrequent flights, a missed connection can mean having to stay overnight, rather than taking the next flight a little later.</p>
        <p>There is also what might be called the Sticks Factor. ''It's just hipper to stay in the city,'' said Toni Giovanetti, the publisher of Hotel Interactive, a business-to-business Web site based in Huntington. ''It's still the place to be if your company doesn't mind footing the bill.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cosgrove of Coronado Travel said that a number of West Coast dot-com companies specifically instruct him to book flights into Kennedy and to make hotel reservations in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Michael Hollander, the president and chief executive of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau, said: ''There is no doubt that New York City is the No. 1 primary destination and that Long Island tends to  be a secondary destination for business travelers. When a business person comes out here, I don't see him going out to the beach by himself.''</p>
        <p>Is that a problem for local hotels?</p>
        <p>''The occupancy rate is 82 percent year round,'' Mr. Hollander said. ''So no, I don't think it's a problem at all.''</p>
