        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>No biotech foods contain fish genes. Several years ago, a company investigated whether a gene from a cold-tolerant fish would allow frozen tomatoes to thaw without turning to mush. The public was uncertain about the transfer of genetic codes from fish to fruit, so the project was dropped. since few if any genes are species-specific, this type of transfer is probably not needed, but the anti-science groups continue to bring it up to raise fear.</p>

        <p>No biotech foods contain fish genes. Several years ago, a company investigated whether a gene from a cold-tolerant fish would allow frozen tomatoes to thaw without turning to mush.

        <p>Mr. Flanagan insults farmers' intelligence by citing a study that alleges that the herbicide-tolerant soybeans they plant on 61 percent of soybean acres produce less yield than other soybeans. In fact, the study compared old, phased-out lines of biotech soybeans with new lines of conventional soybeans. New, improved varieties of seed generally outperform older ones. The preponderance of data shows no difference in yield potential between herbicide-tolerant soybeans and their conventional counterpart.</p>
        <p>Scientific agencies around the world have endorsed the soundness of the regulatory procedures and the safety of crops modified by biotechnology. A recently released study estimated that the European Union's mandatory labeling policy will increase food costs by 17 percent. Over 70 percent of United States consumers support the federal policy, which requires labeling only if a biotechnology-enhanced product is different in nutritional value or safety. There is no reason why American consumers should have to pay the price of mandatory labeling.</p>
