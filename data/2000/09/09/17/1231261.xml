        <p>Photos of new fashion fad of wearing sweatshirts and T-shirts every which way but forward in New York City (On the Streets column) (M)</p>

        <p>The hip-hop rappers have set off another raw fashion fad, doing to the sweatshirt and T-shirt what they did to the baseball cap, wearing them every which way but forward. The results echo the Paris fashion world's deconstruction of classic clothing that was set in motion 12 years ago. There is also a nod to the art world's abstract approach. For most wearers, the neck is the anchor, through the traditional hole for the head, while one or both sleeves are left dangling in the front, the back or the side. When only one sleeve is used, it pulls the sweatshirt into a draped angle. For others, the neck hole becomes a porthole on the wearer's back. The style is achieved by the wearer's imagination and has much to do with beating the heat. This fad is generations apart from wearing a sweater over the shoulders or tied around the waist. The hip-hop world has not exhausted its supply of rebellious fashion.</p>
