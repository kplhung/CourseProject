        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>What a joy to read ''Late Into Politics, Retiring Too Soon'' (Sept. 10) about Pearl Crystal Scher. Ms. Crystal, as I knew her, was my history teacher 41 years ago at Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>I am now retired from the New York City school system after 36 years of service and if asked who the teacher who had the greatest influence on my life was, the answer would always be Pearl Crystal. She was exciting and dynamic. She knew how to get us to think. She gave me a love for the Constitution. She treated us with respect. Others of her students at that time were former Representative and District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman, Corporation Counsel Peter Zimroth and the New Yorker writer Ken Auletta.</p>
