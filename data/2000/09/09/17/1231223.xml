        <p>In spite of its name, the River View Diner in North Bergen is not the place to go for a spectacular view of the Manhattan skyline and the Hudson River. Yes, the diner is nestled near the river, but the truth is, most of its win- dows face north and south and offer just a glimpse of the skyscape, not the panorama the name suggests. The real reason to stop at the River View has to do with something else proclaimed on its sign ''baking on premises.'' Six days a week, John Tsilikas arrives at 6 a.m. and spends five hours in the basement whipping up eye-popping pies and cakes. His repertory includes strawberry pie, Boston cream pie, cheesecake, blueberry cake and the favorite of the owner, Tammis Mavronasios  Black Forest cake. Mr. Tsilikass smooth cheesecakes and rich chocolate tortes match up well against anything a Hoboken patisserie can offer. The River View does not display the desserts in the standard rotating case, which Mr. Mavronasios says, tend to dry out the sweet concoc- tions. At the River View, Mr. Tsilikass works of art are shown off in a climate-controlled trophy case at the center of the restaurant. Oops, dont call the River View ''a restaurant'' or a Greek Diner. Its an American diner, says Mr. Mavronasios, who is proud of the 157-year history of diners in America. Stop in at the River View on a Sunday or Monday, and a prime rib dinner, complete with soup or salad and vegetables, is $12.50. You can top it off with a slice of pie ($2.10), a piece of cake ($2.25) or a slab of cheesecake ($3.25), or buy a whole pie ($15) or cake ($20) to take home.</p>
