        <p>DAVID HALE was developing an animated television show that looked as if it had potential. ''Generation O!,'' about an 8-year-old who just happened to be an international rock star, had a funny concept, catchy music and a punchy visual style.</p>
        <p>There was only one problem: the 8-year-old star was a girl named Molly.</p>
        <p>''We were banging our heads against a wall,'' Mr. Hale recalled of the meetings he and his partners, Jim Proimos and Tim Newman, had with the networks. ''It was the old cliche: girls will watch boys, but boys don't watch girls. We had many people tell us, 'If you turn this character into a boy, this is a hit show.' ''</p>
        <p>They stuck by their idea, and five years after their initial brainstorm, ''Generation O!'' made its debut, on Aug. 26 on WB, with the lead character intact. ''To us, it's a girl empowerment show,'' Mr. Hale said. ''And being a rock star is a thing that every kid aspires to.''</p>
        <p>Molly arrives during a season of extraordinary girl power in animation: at least eight shows having their premieres in 2000 have female leads, radically altering the landscape of television for children.  ABC is even turning a popular live star into a younger animated version in ''Sabrina, the Animated Series.''</p>
        <p>The new programs range from two of Nickelodeon's series for preschoolers -- ''Maggie and the Ferocious Beast'' and ''Dora the Explorer,'' both featuring little girls who navigate unknown lands while imparting lessons about life -- to three fantasy-adventure imports from the realm of Japanese-style anime.</p>
        <p>One of these, Fox's ''CyberSix,'' puts the most unusual twist on gender. The lead is a female cyber-mutant who wears a tight black cat suit and stiletto heels at night, but disguises herself as a male literature teacher by day.</p>
        <p>These new shows fortify the ranks of those that have broken the animated ''boy barrier'' in the past few seasons, ''Pepper Ann,''  ''Daria'' and ''The Wild Thornberrys'' among them.</p>
        <p>The change couldn't be more stark. ''Ten years ago, it was pretty much unheard of to have a female lead in an animation show,'' said Linda Simensky, president of original animation for the Cartoon Network. ''There was a great enlightenment in the early 90's, spurred by 'The Simpsons.' Lisa Simpson was such a good character.''</p>
        <p>Although she wasn't the lead, Lisa -- an ironic teenage commentator on the world who's a good bit smarter than those around her -- set the mold for one type of brainy cartoon girl, epitomized by the sarcastic lead of ''Daria.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Simensky, who started her career at Nickelodeon, now presides over the year-old ''Mike, Lu &amp; Og,'' whose main character is a girl named Mike, and ''The Powerpuff Girls,'' now in its third season, which has been an unqualified hit for the Cartoon Network.</p>
        <p>'' 'Powerpuff' is great because we never said, 'O.K., now give them three best friends who are boys,' '' Ms. Simensky said. ''If we were concentrating on our jobs, we might have said that.''</p>
        <p>Bubbles, Buttercup and Blossom are ''the world's cutest superheroes,'' three bug-eyed, pint-size sisters who battle assorted mutant villains in their native Townsville. The program's action sequences entice children, while adults are attracted by its superhero satire: the girls were created when their dad, Professor Utonium, mistakenly mixed sugar, spice and everything nice with the mysterious and potent Chemical X.</p>
        <p>Craig McCracken, who created ''The Powerpuff Girls'' when he was still an animation student at the California Institute of the Arts, suspected that the knowing humor would attract some older viewers, and he was right: the show has become a pop phenomenon, with licensed merchandise appearing everywhere and a feature film in the works.  What he didn't expect was that in a TV landscape with relatively few options, young viewers would see the Powerpuff Girls as role models.</p>
        <p>''I get a lot of girls saying that they look up to them,'' said Mr. McCracken, who professes surprise at the reaction to his show. ''It developed into a whole subculture. There are girls who say, 'My best friend's a Buttercup, but I'm a Bubbles.' They identify with the different personalities.''</p>
        <p>T HE Powerpuff Girls'' and ''Generation O!'' are part of a trend within the trend -- many of the new shows were created exclusively by men. ''The real story is how three old guys have created the hottest girls' property,'' joked Mr. Hale, 49, a musician and former advertising executive. The character of Molly O! was inspired by his daughter, Isabel, who is now 10.</p>
        <p>Historical precedent partly explains the initial resistance to ''Generation O!'' and other shows that struggled to get airtime. In the heyday of the Warner Brothers cartoons, there were almost no female animators and hence few female characters; Bugs Bunny in drag was as girlish as it got.</p>
        <p>Even as the years went on, cartoon girls were eye candy or dispensable plot points; exceptions like ''Josie and the Pussycats'' were rare. And despite the recent influx, they're still heavily outnumbered by boy-oriented shows.</p>
        <p>''What attracted us to having a strong female character like Daria is that back in '97, we hadn't seen it before on television,'' said Abby Terkuhle, president of MTV animation and executive producer of ''Daria.''</p>
        <p>The character Daria Morgendorffer, an expressionless high schooler with big black glasses, was spun off from MTV's ''Beavis and Butthead.'' Now entering her fourth season of dispensing wry witticisms, she has solidified her appeal with viewers enough to merit her own TV movie, which was broadcast in August.</p>
        <p>''When I first started in this business, there were few women in animation at all,'' said Chuck Swenson, co-creator and executive producer of ''Mike, Lu &amp; Og.''  ''Now it's getting closer to equal proportions. And as more women are coming to the fore on the network side, you'll see even more girls in the shows.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Swenson has worked in the business for 30 years, most recently overseeing ''Rugrats,'' the popular Nickelodeon program whose toughest character is the fearsome cousin Angelica, who bosses around a motley crew of toddlers. For ''Mike, Lu &amp; Og,'' he developed the tomboy character of Mike with her two Russian creators, Mikhail Aldashin and Mikhail Shindel.</p>
        <p>On the show, the 11-year-old Mike -- short for Michelanne -- is a girl from the Bronx who interacts with a strange bunch of natives on a desert island where she has chosen to live as an exchange student.</p>
        <p>''She's smart, one of those kids who's got it all together in her own mind,'' said Mr. Swenson, who joins Mr. Hale in crediting his daughters  as models for his animated creation. ''But she's thrown up against people who seem like they're from another planet.''</p>
        <p>As the series took shape, however, Mr. Swenson realized that a critical perspective was missing. ''Once the show was sold, I consciously sought out female writers,'' he said. ''There really is a difference in their stories.''</p>
        <p>He cited an episode in which Mike changes her friendly allegiances from one girl to another. ''The male writers made jokes about their separation and hurt feelings, but the women in the room stopped us cold,'' Mr. Swenson said. ''They told us very pointedly that that kind of situation was really serious for a girl.''</p>
        <p>Many of the episodes center on the rivalry between Mike, a tomboy, and Lu, a more traditionally girly girl. That basic conflict also animates one of the most successful programs introduced last year, Fox's ''Angela Anaconda.''</p>
        <p>Angela, a third-grader at Tapwater Springs Elementary, isn't really a brainiac or a tomboy -- she just wants to enjoy herself, a goal constantly foiled by the poodle-toting rich girl Nanette Manoir. (It's also the rare cartoon that dares to tackle issues of class, though it does so in a lighthearted way.) Much of the show is devoted to Angela's fantasy life, in which she wreaks revenge on Nanette.</p>
        <p>Unlike many of the other characters, Angela comes from the imaginations of two women. ''That's the kind of kid I was,'' said Joanna Ferrone, the co-creator of the show. ''I was really a dreamer. I couldn't help but observe that although we're all told that everybody is created equal and has an equal shot at things, that wasn't really how life was.''</p>
        <p>Angela resembles ''Pepper Ann,'' which is now in its fourth season on ABC, because the leads don't always master every situation, as a superhero girl might. ''In both shows, sometimes the main character does the wrong thing,'' said Sue Rose, who created both characters. ''That's a much more valuable way to teach a lesson.''</p>
        <p>When Ms. Rose hears reactions to ''Angela,'' one theme stands out. ''The most frequent feedback we get is from parents of boys,'' she said. ''They say: 'My boys watch it and they love it. I never thought they would.' These are not just girls' shows, they're kids shows. And whether you're a girl or a boy, you're going to exhibit many of these same feelings.''</p>
        <p>Part of its popularity undoubtedly comes from the humor that leavens the show's message -- which is, as Ms. Rose puts it, ''You are what you are, and it's cool to be you.'' Angela often ends up in comic situations that Lucy Ricardo might have found familiar, as when she enters a pogo contest despite not knowing how to pogo. The look of the show -- a two-dimensional, cut-and-paste collage with black-and-white faces -- enhances the feeling of retro comedy.</p>
        <p>According to Ms. Simensky of the Cartoon Network, even as the tide turned for girl characters, a certain amount of political correctness kept them from being the butt of jokes -- and laughs are still the most prized currency in a cartoon. ''You can roll over a male character with a steamroller,'' she said, ''but if you do that to a girl or a minority character, people might get up in arms.''</p>
        <p>Funny or not, animated characters tend to attract an unusual devotion from their creators, since they spring whole from the mind and are not diluted by casting. Ms. Rose, who may have the record for successful girl-led cartoons, even lends her own voice for the character of Angela Anaconda.</p>
        <p>But she also faces a year of separation anxiety. This is the last season of new episodes for the groundbreaking ''Pepper Ann,'' and the shows are already completed. (The 12-year-old-girl-angst slot may be taken over by Nickelodeon's ''As Told to Ginger,'' which makes its debut in October.)</p>
        <p>Though animated characters never get any older, they do move into syndication. ''I miss Pepper Ann, I really do,'' Ms. Rose said with a maternal sigh. ''I want to know more about what's going on with her.''</p>
