        <p>Cleavage has always been hot, but the starlets at the Emmys and the MTV Awards showed that necklines have plunged to new levels of low. While they can get away with baring all, women who travel in more buttoned-up circles, like Tamara Mellon, the managing director of Jimmy Choo shoes, have to tone down the racy, rock 'n' roll look. At a recent company dinner in Southampton, N.Y., the guest list included the techno rocker Moby as well as members of the social establishment, like Anne Hearst. Ms. Mellon's turquoise outfit by Celine, which is covered in Swarovski crystals, has a neckline to the waist and a skirt with a keyhole just below the navel. ''It fits on the right side of sex if your arms and back are covered,'' explained Ms. Mellon, who lives in London, where Jimmy Choo's headquarters are. ''I would definitely not wear a low V-front with spaghetti straps or a low back or short skirt. It would be too trampy.''</p>

        <p>Her crystal-covered sling-backs are  by Jimmy Choo, naturally. With a revealing outfit, ''I would keep the shoes high, with thin straps,'' she advised.  ''It should look strappy, delicate and sexy.''</p>
