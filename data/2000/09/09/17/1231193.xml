        <p>New Jersey Transit plans to reduce its staff by attrition and eliminate some contingency funds that would have been available to boost service to keep its promise not to raise fares, Jeffrey A. Warsh, New Jersey Transit executive director, said.</p>
        <p>Last week, the board of directors approved a $1.036 billion budget that included $209.1 million in state financing, which is a 40 percent increase over last year but is $39 million less than what the agency had anticipated for the fiscal year that started July 1.</p>

        <p>New Jersey Transit plans to reduce its staff by attrition and eliminate some contingency funds that would have been available to boost service to keep its promise not to raise fares, Jeffrey A. Warsh, New Jersey Transit executive director, said.</p>
        <p>Last week, the board of directors approved a $1.036 billion budget that included $209.1 million in state financing, which is a 40 percent increase over last year but is $39 million less than what the agency had anticipated for the fiscal year that started July 1.</p>
        <p>New Jersey Transit officials promised there would be no fare increase this fiscal year or the next for its 360,000 daily rail and bus riders, who have not seen an increase since 1990.</p>
        <p>''We are making reductions from what was requested, not reductions from last year's operating expenses,'' Mr. Marsh said. ''We have slowed the rate of increase.''</p>
        <p>To make this year's budget balance, department heads have 45 days to reduce their budgets by 1 percent, which will save $10.1 million for the remainder of this fiscal year. This will not involve layoffs.</p>
        <p>The second largest amount is projected to come from revenue from increased ridership. It is estimated overall ridership will go up by 3 percent on trains 1 percent on buses.</p>
        <p>Another major portion of the shortfall will be made up by shifting $6 million in capital money from the State Transportation Trust Fund to pay for operating expenses, but no specific building projects are expected to be delayed because of the shift.</p>
        <p>What may not get done is adding buses or rail cars to lines that become overcrowded. A contingency fund of $3 million that was to be available to increase bus service and a similar $1 million contingency fund for expanding train service in the event of overcrowding will be eliminated.</p>
        <p>''In the past, if a bus line became crowded, a supervisor could call and we'd put another bus on the route,'' Mr. Marsh said. ''Now we may not be able to do that right away.''</p>
        <p>Other cuts include $2.9 million aimed at advertising new services and to paying for sponsorship of community events and a $1.2 million allocation for increasing cleaning of trains.</p>
        <p>With those savings another $4.8 million is still needed to close the gap and will be made up through not filling jobs that are vacated.</p>
