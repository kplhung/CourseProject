        <p>THE fatal crash of a supersonic Concorde northeast of Paris on July 25 has renewed debate over the construction of a third major airport to serve the French capital. The fact that the Concorde could easily have come down on top of a small town, with even more than the four deaths that resulted among people on the ground, is also raising questions about the safety of existing airports in or near cities, about their further development and about the location of future airports elsewhere in Europe.</p>
        <p>Fierce disputes over inner city airports have erupted on the Continent in recent years, notably in Italy, where a group of European airlines has taken Alitalia to court over its plans for Linate Airport, a 15-minute drive from downtown Milan. The argument erupted after Alitalia, backed by the Italian authorities, sought to capitalize on local resistance to Linate by forcing its European competitors to use a new airport, Malpensa, a $65 cab ride from central Milan, while Alitalia reserved Linate for itself.</p>
        <p>In Berlin, controversy is simmering about the future of downtown Tempelhof Airport, site of the 1949 airlift into Berlin by the Western Allies. Berlin now relies mainly on tiny Tegel Airport, in former West Berlin, and proposals to enlarge Schonefeld, the old East Berlin airport, into a major international hub are hamstrung by debates among politicians, air traffic planners and environmentalists opposed to any airport enlargement. Meanwhile, the former East German city of Leipzig, whose airport was upgraded after the fall of the Berlin Wall, is booming, attracting travelers from as far away as Berlin.</p>
        <p>In Paris, the numbers speak for themselves. Last year, Charles de Gaulle Airport, departure point for the fatal Concorde flight, registered 490,000 takeoffs and landings, a leap of 100,000 in three years. The airport, in Roissy on the northeastern outskirts of the city, handled 44 million passengers, almost 13 percent more than in 1998. At that rate of growth, a ceiling of 55 million passengers set by the French government will be reached by 2002.</p>
        <p>In March, Yves Cousquer, president of Aeroports de Paris, the government-owned company that operates Charles De Gaulle and Orly, the smaller Paris airport, said that construction of a third airport for the Paris region had become unavoidable. After the Concorde crash near the town of Gonesse, which killed 113 people, the French minister of transportation, Jean-Claude Gayssot, said a formal decision to build the third airport would probably come this month and a site would be chosen by year's end.</p>
        <p>Such a decision will not be easy. Originally, Aeroports de Paris favored expanding Charles de Gaulle and Orly, but after the  crash, Mr. Cousquer acknowledged that construction of a third airport had become ''ineluctable.'' In towns like Gonesse that profit from jobs the airports create, mayors and other politicians are torn between the benefits and the risks. If the Concorde had crashed in the center of Gonesse, instead of its thinly populated outskirts, the number of victims would certainly have been far higher.</p>
        <p>Discussion of a possible third airport for Paris began in the mid-1990's, as the saturation of Charles de Gaulle and Orly clashed increasingly with French ambitions to build Paris into a major European hub to compete with Frankfurt and London. Initially, the government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, which took office in 1997 with the backing of Green parties and environmentally sensitive leftists, shelved the idea, preferring instead to expand the two existing airports. Generally, the Greens and their leftist allies oppose hub development, favoring smaller regional airports and preferring high-speed trains, rather than planes, for trips shorter than 500 miles.</p>
        <p>In 1996, the government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe had proposed a site at Beauvilliers, near Chartres about 50 miles southwest of Paris. Mayors in the region objected, suggesting Vatry, a town east of Paris near a proposed high-speed train line between Paris and Strasbourg. Whatever the choice, Mr. Cousquer of Aeroports de Paris says the third airport will not be in operation before 2025. The Juppe government had envisaged an opening in 2015.</p>
        <p>These projections have encouraged a bid by Lyon, in the southeast of France, to turn its airport, Lyon-St.-Exupery, into a second major port of entry to France at less cost and time than it would take to build a third Paris airport. Bernard Chaffange, director of Lyon-St.-Exupery, says that the airport, which has a high-speed train link to Paris and will connect next year with Marseille on the Mediterranean coast, could absorb the 40 percent of international travelers now flying into Paris but ultimately destined for business or vacations in the south of France.</p>
        <p>In July, Mr. Gayssot approved further investment at Lyon-St.-Exupery, including two additional runways. Local environmentalists and others opposed to the expansion are already organizing resistance.</p>
