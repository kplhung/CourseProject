        <p>It was so big that they used a crane to hoist it up from the street, hauling it over the 11-story building, down into a central courtyard, and through a window. They went through all the trouble, not to mention the $150,000 expense, because the boss thought it was essential to the company's image.</p>
        <p>The latest craze has hit Manhattan's high-technology corridor: fish tanks. Big ones.</p>
        <p>No one has ever accused Silicon Alley companies, with their Ping-Pong tables and built-in model car racetracks, of reading the old textbook on corporate culture.</p>
        <p>The corporate symbolism of the 1980's  was conspicuous consumption, as companies bought Learjets, added live ducks to the swimming ponds and paneled the walls with mahogany. Until the October 1987 stock market crash, the game was ''mine is bigger than yours.'' But in today's dot-com and technology world, the mindset is ''mine is cooler than yours.''</p>
        <p>At Predictive Systems, a technology company on Fifth Avenue near 38th Street, company executives installed a 16-foot-long, 2,000-gallon plexiglass fish tank at the wall between the lobby and the company conference room. Michael R. Bloomberg may have brought fish tanks into the corporate consciousness (he has 250 tanks at Bloomberg sites around the world), but dot-com companies in recent years have raised them to an art form that is one part executive indulgence, one part attention grabber and one part employee perk.</p>
        <p>The Predictive Systems tank, for example, is lined with coral and rocks and includes everything from Atlantic anemones and emerald crabs to Brittle starfish and peppermint shrimp. Not to mention dozens of fish. ''I just thought it was one of the coolest things,'' said Robert Belau, president and co-founder of Predictive Systems. ''In college, I had a small one. It replaced television in my life.''</p>
        <p>The tank, which weighs around 5,000 pounds, requires two rooms full of equipment to keep the water clean and stable (the environment is similar to the Red Sea or the waters off Bermuda). But to Mr. Belau, it is not size but style that matters. It serves a business purpose too, he said.</p>
        <p>''No one who comes to the office forgets it,'' Mr. Belau said. ''If you have someone leave your office and say 'wow,' that is an intangible benefit.''</p>
        <p>According to corporate managers and to aquarium companies like the House of Fins, based in Greenwich, Conn., Predictive Systems is one of dozens of Silicon Alley companies that have latched on to fish tanks built into walls and floors or placed above doorways or in other unusual places.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for the fish, a problem has emerged: many Internet companies bought into aquatic office ambience in the months before many dot-com stocks sank on the Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>Peter N. Ramundo, general manager of the House of Fins, said many high-technology companies were not prepared for the long-term expense. ''The costs definitely multiply,'' he said, adding that the tanks are expensive. Several companies had to get rid of their fish tanks. ''Not to use a really bad analogy, but it brings a whole new meaning to the words 'sink or swim,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>The Predictive Systems aquarium ran about $150,000 -- but the expense of removing one like it would be much higher. And many of the cash-strapped companies that ordered the fish in better times cannot afford to have them removed. ''We had no idea what it would cost, how much it would be and whether it would be possible,'' said Mr. Belau, the Predictive president, thinking hypothetically or well into the future, since his firm is financially healthy. ''But I feel sorry for the guy who has to take this out of here in 10 years or whatever.''</p>
        <p>Some think the fish tale at the dot-coms holds broader lessons.</p>
        <p>Management consultants now tell technology employers that the best way to tap into the creativity of their employees is to establish fun workplaces. Those entering the work force today, particularly in technology, are no longer searching for the stability of a lifelong job, but a place where they can learn new skills and enjoy themselves.</p>
        <p>But experts warn that there are costs to these environments: investors stew over what they see as wasted time and frivolous spending; employees can become distracted in some environments, hurting the bottom line; and there is always the possibility of dead fish.</p>
        <p>As one executive at a more conservative dot-com put it, getting a good laugh at the demise of his competitors' aquariums, ''How does having a trampoline or fish tank in their office help anything?''</p>
        <p>The key, the consultants say, is finding a balance between a whimsical work environment and one that means business.</p>
        <p>Jerry Epstein, the chief executive of PeopleTrends, a San Francisco company that advises businesses on how to best acquire and retain customers and employees, said that ''there is no question companies need to be more creative.'' But he said that companies had to make sure the environment made sense for their businesses as well as their employees. ''It needs to increase productivity, increase morale and enhance the workplace.''</p>
        <p>In Silicon Alley, which began its first round of real layoffs this year, some are focusing on low-cost creativity. In Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, one company has taken a measured approach.</p>
        <p>Karl Thuge, chief operating officer of Corcoran.com, an international online real estate company, wants his employees to feel as if they work in a dynamic and nimble environment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thuge keeps a Ping-Pong table in the conference room and a basketball hoop outside an office. A racetrack for model cars runs around cubicles.</p>
        <p>''We are demanding such a long work day that we want to create a balance between work and fun,'' he said. ''If they are going to spend so much time in the office, they should be able to have fun.''</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Thuge said, he has not bought any fish tanks and has no plans to.</p>
