        <p>AMONG the most oil-dependent regions in the country, Long Island is bracing for a potentially bruising fall and winter that could chill the still-surging regional economy and empty consumers' pockets as oil prices rise.</p>
        <p>Retail prices for home heating oil used in more than two-thirds of Long Island homes -- a density unmatched elsewhere -- were already averaging $1.50 per gallon last week, according to the Oil Heat Institute of Long Island, a trade group.

        <p>AMONG the most oil-dependent regions in the country, Long Island is bracing for a potentially bruising fall and winter that could chill the still-surging regional economy and empty consumers' pockets as oil prices rise.</p>
        <p>Retail prices for home heating oil used in more than two-thirds of Long Island homes -- a density unmatched elsewhere -- were already averaging $1.50 per gallon last week, according to the Oil Heat Institute of Long Island, a trade group. But the price was widely expected to rise above $2 as the heating season commences. Kevin Rooney, the trade group's chief executive officer, said retail prices matching a peak of $2.40 a gallon last year were possible.</p>
        <p>''Last year was pretty wild, to say the least, and this year is shaping up as a repeat,'' Mr. Rooney said. Much would depend on the weather, he added.</p>
        <p>Tight global supply and limits on refining capacity are at the root of the problem. An agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise crude oil production by 800,0000 barrels a day and efforts by other foreign and domestic oil producers to increase output would have limited effect or come too late to lower retail prices soon, experts have said.</p>
        <p>On Long Island, the effect of the higher prices will be immediate and severe. Every dime increase in the price per gallon would add $100 to a typical homeowner's seasonal heating bill. For a typical delivery of 250 gallons, the cost would increase from $375 at the current price of $1.50 to $500 at the $2-a-gallon price to $600 if the price again reaches $2.40.</p>
        <p>Businesses, schools, governments and private and public institutions using heating oil would also be hit with higher costs eventually reflected in retail prices, fees and taxes.</p>
        <p>Natural gas prices were also going up. Keyspan, the region's largest supplier, has warned its 500,000 gas customers in Nassau and Suffolk that bills will be 15 percent higher this season. Gasoline prices were expected to approach $2 a gallon, a retailers association said, and electric rates are also under strong upward pressure.</p>
        <p>The Long Island Power Authority must soon decide how or whether to collect from customers some or all of the oil-driven higher wholesale electric prices it has been paying for months.</p>
        <p>''Our goal is to hold steady and not pass along these higher costs to customers, but it's going to be a struggle,'' said the LIPA chairman, Richard M. Kessel.</p>
        <p>More than 75 percent of the authority's electricity comes from former Lilco generating stations now owned and operated by Keyspan, Lilco's successor. Oil and natural gas that power the plants are the source of the increases in wholesale electric prices that the authority has temporarily absorbed.</p>
        <p>Some other privately owned utilities in New York are permitted by state regulators to quickly pass along higher petroleum costs to customers, as Lilco once did. But by law the power authority may only adjust rates annually, at the beginning of each year.</p>
        <p>Bonnie Habyan, a spokeswoman for Keyspan, said the company currently held in storage in Pennsylvania half of the gas it estimated it needed this winter to supply residential customers. ''It's already in hand,'' she said, and therefore was not subject to price increases because of higher wellhead prices.</p>
        <p>Ms. Habyan said about half of customer bills were for taxes and pipeline transportation costs that were unaffected by gas prices.</p>
        <p>But such price cushions don't exist for gasoline at Long Island pumps.</p>
        <p>Kathryn Pollane, the executive director of the Long Island Gasoline Retailers Association in Melville, said $2 a gallon gasoline prices were possible if the upward spiral of oil prices continued.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pollane, whose association has about 1,000 members in Nassau, Suffolk and Queens, said average prices last week were $1.61 a gallon for regular gasoline at self-service stations.</p>
        <p>On car-dependent Long Island, where public transportation is not an option for many commuters, higher gasoline costs will cut into disposable income as the cost of driving to and from work spikes upward.</p>
        <p>''Long Island is a pretty spread-out economy and people have to depend on several cars per family,'' said Dr. Irwin L. Kellner, a professor of economics at Hofstra University and chief economist for CBS MarketWatch. Dr. Kellner said higher gasoline prices would also boost distribution costs for businesses, leading to higher retail prices for food and other consumer products.</p>
        <p>Consumers with less to spend on items that cost more would naturally buy less, hurting retail businesses and reducing sales tax revenues, he said. Nassau and Suffolk Counties depend heavily on sales taxes to finance budgets. They would face pressure to raise property taxes to make up any shortfall.</p>
        <p>''You don't have a choice about heating your home in the winter,'' Dr. Kellner said. ''And if it's cold, that is going to take a lot of buying power.''</p>
        <p>The National Weather Service's 90-day forecast for the New York metropolitan area called for temperatures close to normal. But the first cold snap will still be a fearsome thing, said Mr. Rooney of the Oil Heat Institute.</p>
        <p>''The only thing that is holding down the retail price at this point, of course, is the fact that there is no demand for heating oil,'' he said. ''But as we get into the heating oil season the demand begins to bring down inventories and put more pressure on refineries. Then you will see a steady increase in the retail prices.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rooney said inventories of heating oil held by dealers on Long Island would quickly be used up, reflecting in part a decline in dealers' tank space over the years. He said the best advice he could offer was to buy heating oil as soon as possible and hope for a mild fall and winter.</p>
        <p>Oil-driven price increases were creeping in everywhere. On the cross-sound ferry between Orient Point and New London, a $1 surcharge on all cars and drivers offsets what the ferry service said was a doubling of its fuel costs in the last several months. Even foot passengers pay the extra $1. Trucks pay $2 to $3 extra, depending on size. ''The customers have been very understanding,'' said Stanley W. Mickus, the director of marketing.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen whether higher gasoline prices will lessen road congestion. But a state Department of Transportation spokeswoman, Eileen Peters, said car pooling appeared to be up. ''The one trend that we have noticed,'' she said, ''is that our park-and-ride lots are a lot fuller than they were six months ago.''</p>
