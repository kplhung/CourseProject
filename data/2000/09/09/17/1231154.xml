        <p>Battle of Stonington</p>
        <p>The Battle of Stonington during the War of 1812 will be the subject of a talk by James Tertius de Kay at a dinner on Thursday in Stamford.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Kay has written a number of books on 19th-century naval history, including one called ''The Battle of Stonington,'' chronicling a little known but significant attack on the village by the British Royal Navy.</p>

        <p>Battle of Stonington</p>
        <p>The Battle of Stonington during the War of 1812 will be the subject of a talk by James Tertius de Kay at a dinner on Thursday in Stamford.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Kay has written a number of books on 19th-century naval history, including one called ''The Battle of Stonington,'' chronicling a little known but significant attack on the village by the British Royal Navy.</p>
        <p>Its subtitle, ''Torpedoes, Submarines and Rockets in the War of 1812'' alludes to his coverage of some surprisingly modern aspects of the war.</p>
        <p>The program, presented by the Navy League's Western Connecticut Council, will be held at the Stamford Yacht Club, beginning at 6 p.m. with a cocktail reception, followed by dinner and Mr. de Kay's lecture. Tickets at $50 may be obtained by calling (203) 329-7625.</p>
        <p>Graveyard Tours</p>
        <p>Here's an idea for something to do on Halloween. Heritage Trails, a sightseeing outfit in Farmington, will run a guided nighttime tour of two historic graveyards, followed by dinner in the glow of the fireplace at a candlelighted 1700's colonial Tavern. The tab is $32.95, including transportation by bus.</p>
        <p>Burial methods of the time, stories of the people interred and the meanings of the gravestone carvings will be discussed by the guide. Participants are advised to bring one flashlight per person. The tour company also offers self-guided walking tours on a 90-minute cassette tape for the two locations: Riverside Cemetery, 1833, and the Ancient Burying Ground, 1661, for a price of $11.50.</p>
        <p>William Gillette, the actor; Lambert Hitchcock, creator of the stenciled chair; and Sarah Porter, founder of Miss Porter's School are buried in Riverside Cemetery.</p>
        <p>The Ancient Burying Ground contains the graves of early settlers rather than the celebrities who came later. The number to call for reservations or more information is (860) 677-8867.</p>
        <p>Dulcimers and More</p>
        <p>You too can play a hammered dulcimer, or a bodhran, guitar, fiddle, banjo or drum. Workshops on these and other instruments, led by musicians from all over the country, will be part of the Housatonic Dulcimer Celebration at St. John's Episcopal Church in New Milford on Friday, Saturday and next Sunday.</p>
        <p>Concerts and mini-concerts are scheduled on Friday and Saturday evenings featuring David Massengill, Tina Bergmann, Mike Kachuba, Sam Moffatt and Thomasina, plus a dozen or more folk musicians and singers. Sally Rogers will conduct two workshops and give a noontime concert on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Instruments are available for rent, and tickets to the concerts are $10. The number to call for more information or reservations is (203) 266-7560 or (860) 567-1605.</p>
        <p>A Look at a Viking Ship</p>
        <p>A four-year-old ship built to the exact specifications of a ninth-century Viking vessel, will be open for boarding from Thursday through Sunday at Mystic Seaport. It was constructed to commemorate the 1,000th anniversary of Leif Eriksson's voyage from Iceland to North America.</p>
        <p>The original model for Islendingur (Iceland), as the model is called, was Gaukstadaskip, a long ship or warship, excavated in Norway in 1882. Dated around AD 870, it was 75 feet long, 17 feet wide and weighed 80 tons. The current reproduction, which would normally have had a crew of 70, manning 32 oars in double shifts, is managed by an Icelandic crew of nine, propelled by one sail and a back-up engine.</p>
        <p>Take Exit 90 from Interstate 95 to reach Mystic Seaport at 75 Greenmanville Avenue in Mystic.</p>
        <p>Admission to the grounds and all exhibitions is $16, $8 for children. The number to call for more information is (888) 973-2767 (9SEAPORT).</p>
        <p>Rare Books in Branford</p>
        <p>The James Blackstone Memorial Library book sale taking place on the green in Branford next weekend will feature several early and rare items. Among them are ''An Abridgement of the History of England'' by Dr. Goldsmith, London, 1783; Brewer's ''A Residence in Constantinople in the Year 1827'' (New Haven, 1830); a second edition of Hooker's ''The Soule's Vocation or Effectual Calling to Christ'' (London, 1638); Busch's ''Max and Maurice: A Juvenile History in Seven Tricks'' (1882) and ''The Easy Instructor, or a New Method of Teaching Sacred Harmony'' (Albany, 1828).</p>
        <p>In addition there are large collections of books on art, sports, entertainment, biographies, books about Yale and New Haven, and books for children. The sale will be open on Friday and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and next Sunday from 11 to 2.</p>
        <p>The number to call for more information is (203) 488-1441.</p>
        <p>Danbury Book Sale</p>
        <p>More than 20,000 books, videos, audio books, CD's, cassettes and records will be for sale at the Danbury Library Book Sale. It will be held at the White Hall Annex on the midtown campus of Western Connecticut State University, off White and Fifth Streets.</p>
        <p>Hardcovers and paperbacks will be categorized into more than 30 subjects, and authors of fiction will be presented alphabetically. Biographies and autobiographies will be identified by name. Hours on Saturday begin with a preview from 8 to 9 a.m., for which admission will be $10. Admission will be free during regular hours on Saturday from 9 to 5 and next Sunday from 10 to 4. The number to call for more information is (203) 797-4533.</p>
        <p>Works of Edward Lear</p>
        <p>For northern European artists of the 19th century, India, the Middle East and the Mediterranean were a siren call, promising inspiration for exotic subject material from landscapes to architecture to human beings of a different color, culture and costume.</p>
        <p>Edward Lear (1812-1888) was one of those artists, and it is on that area of his life that a new exhibition at the Yale Center for British Art opens on Wednesday. Usually ''The Owl and the Pussycat'' and his other nonsense verses are what pop into mind at the mention of his name rather than his skill as a painter and draftsman.</p>
        <p>The exhibition, titled ''Edward Lear and the Art of Travel,'' focuses on his sojourns in foreign lands -- a pursuit followed by many British citizens at that time. Among 30 artists other than Lear who are represented in over 60 works are J. M. W. Turner, Richard Parkes Bonington, and David Roberts. They are hung in addition to 114 drawings, 12 paintings and 6 books by Lear.</p>
        <p>The show had its genesis in a gift of almost 400 Lear paintings and drawings donated in 1997 by Donald C. Gallup, a Yale alumnus and former curator of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Center officials say it is the largest and most valuable gift other than that of Paul Mellon, founder of the center. It will remain on view through Jan. 14.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday at 5:15, a lecture on the exhibition will be presented by Dr. Viven Noakes, an authority on Lear. Admission is free, as is admission to the exhibition. Visiting hours are on Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 5. The center's address is 1080 Chapel Street in New Haven and the number for recorded information is (203)  432-2800.</p>
