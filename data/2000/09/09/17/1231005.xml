        <p>Christopher Isherwood's life in the 1930's was always changing trains, never sure whether bliss or tragedy waited at the end of the line. That upheaval made the man and the writer, for it inspired a response that so many remember: ''I am a camera, with its shutter open, quite passive.'' Of course, Isherwood was not really passive, just hiding. He could regard the machine as a dead model. Its way of taking in every sight, every burst of light, helped school stoicism or courage in a sensitive soul. When the world was too much, then we should settle for mere description, or record, of the turmoil. The Russian filmmaker Dziga Vertov and the American novelist John Dos Passos had similar instincts that the new sensibility should learn from progress's pounding automata.</p>
        <p>In the 30's, Isherwood (the grandson of a Cheshire squire) had gone from Cambridge to Berlin (Auden told him it had the naughtiest boys). He had begun as a novelist, and met his first great love, Heinz Neddermeyer. For years, hurrying from one country to another, he tried to save Heinz from the Nazis. It was a mad railway chase that ended in 1937 when the boyfriend was arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned for draft evasion and ''reciprocal onanism.'' Isherwood never stopped moving, or writing: stories, novels, film scripts and the notorious flight to America in 1939 with Auden. There, eventually, he secured a visa and settled into the golden numbness of California. Alas. For calm and peace were never as good for him as hard times.</p>
        <p>Let us say he had a quiet war, being classified 4-E, but finding that no handicap in working his way through Navy lads, fringe actors, beach boys and the rich and restful, while conspiring on scripts for films like ''Rage in Heaven'' -- one of the silliest pictures ever made. Isherwood would later claim that years as a scenarist had taught him so much about ''the visual,'' and his engagements with all those lads certainly guided him in mechanical, or dolly-shot, motion. One can only hope that some of the couplings were more entertaining than the movies.</p>
        <p>By 1945, at the age of 41, Isherwood stopped writing his journal. That's the historic explanation for this belated book, ''Lost Years,'' just as it is a clue to depression or dismay with tranquillity that the book largely ignores. After all, who would expect cameras to puzzle out any question of disquiet, let alone the answer? Then, years later, in 1972, Isherwood went back to fill in the autobiographical hole by doing a memoir from his bare diary of engagements. Only now is that book published, with massive scholarly bombardment, provided by Katherine Bucknell, who has done editions of other Isherwood diaries and stories and of Auden poems.</p>
        <p>''Lost Years'' covers the period 1945-51, in which the stamina or self-awareness necessary for a journal dissolved in drink and promiscuity. Time and again, Christopher is on the floor, scarcely alert to what is going on. Day after day he is caught up in the techniques of reciprocal onanism. Only one book, ''Prater Violet,'' was published in these years, and that was written in 1943-4. Apart from that, he was struggling to make sense out of movies like ''The Woman in White'' (from Wilkie Collins) and ''The Great Sinner'' (from Dostoyevsky). (This was not the worst: years later, Isherwood did the life of Diane de Poitiers for Lana Turner, then tried to persuade Gore Vidal, or himself, that it was viable.)</p>
        <p>These are dazzlingly empty years more than they are lost ones. Their record here will do nothing for Isherwood and posterity, just as it has woefully little of the things any camera might have picked up -- the light of the West just before final urbanization; a silver-bright charmed age of noir movies; the spreading threat of McCarthyism in Hollywood. To say nothing of the atomic bomb and its big brother, Truman and Stalin or the realization of what the camps had been in Europe. Worst of all, the book doesn't explain some decline in Christopher Isherwood, or his loss of faith in journals keeping a life in order. But Isherwood cannot bring himself to explore grief over Heinz, the guilt about leaving Britain or the true boredom of California instead. As late as the late 40's, he was considering the life of a monk, yet we never hear the argument over that -- just the settling for so many guys in a manner that would surely provoke complaint if this were a straight author telling us about all the women he had had and discarded. If only he could remember. ''Lost Years'' discloses an illness that never hit in the 30's -- a loss of interest in people. If only, somewhere, this Christopher could say, ''I said I was a camera, and I have paid for that clever trick.''</p>
        <p>Yet there is something that gives away the horror. In the memoir, Isherwood writes in the third person, and then slips into first in commentary or the long footnotes that fuss over recollection. Here he is on a trip back to London in 1947, visiting with E. M. Forster: ''On March 3, Christopher went with Forster to supper at the sadly down-at-heel Reform Club and then saw 'Les Enfants du Paradis,' which was having a big success. I can't remember what either of them thought then of this hateful film.'' Or, ''I am inclined to feel irritated by Christopher, because the memories he has chosen to pass down to me are chiefly of compliments paid him, of sex encounters and suchlike.''</p>
        <p>Such side steps unsettle the reader, but that very bump could be a fine device for a book written by a madman and a murderer. Isherwood was neither, but syntax shows the rot in his soul.</p>
        <p>There are names dropped along the way -- Benjamin Britten, the Stravinskys, Marlon Brando and Garbo. There are even a few pages of authentic gossip and funny talk -- like Emlyn Williams grilling Chaplin on how Thomas Ince had really died on a notorious yacht trip in l924. Was it food poisoning, or the result of Charlie being caught with Marion Davies so William Randolph Hearst went wild with a gun? Then there's John Collier -- a lesser writer than Isherwood but a better scenarist -- mulling over how to do Proust and concluding that instead of being secret homosexuals all the characters should be itching to get into show business.</p>
        <p>It's not enough to make a book, and one senses that it barely kept Isherwood interested enough to make it to 1951, when the Broadway debut of John Van Druten's play ''I Am a Camera'' changed his status forever, or 1953, when Don Bachardy came into his life.</p>
