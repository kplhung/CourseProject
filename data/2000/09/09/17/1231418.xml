        <p>They laughed, they cried, but it was not quite better than ''Cats.'' They were there, after all, to buy Memories.</p>
        <p>As the Andrew Lloyd Webber soundtrack played in the background, several hundred tourists, teachers and felinophiles from as far away as Florida pawed through the leavings of the longest-running show in Broadway history, which closed Sept. 10 after 7,485 performances. The Winter Garden Theater's seats had been removed, and the space taken over by racks of tufted, hand-painted unitards offered for $75.</p>

        <p>They laughed, they cried, but it was not quite better than ''Cats.'' They were there, after all, to buy Memories.</p>
        <p>As the Andrew Lloyd Webber soundtrack played in the background, several hundred tourists, teachers and felinophiles from as far away as Florida pawed through the leavings of the longest-running show in Broadway history, which closed Sept. 10 after 7,485 performances. The Winter Garden Theater's seats had been removed, and the space taken over by racks of tufted, hand-painted unitards offered for $75.</p>
        <p>A giant $25 yogurt cup from the musical's junkyard scene was headed to a corporate law firm for reincarnation as a garbage can. Grizabella the Glamour Cat's shoes were a steal at $50. And Bustopher Jones's costume, complete with spats, dickey, and fleece overcoat -- which, according to the program, comes complete ''with built in roundness, including tail!'' -- was to be auctioned off later. The opening bid: $250.</p>
        <p>Hector Montalvo of Manhattan said he had seen a whopping nine percent (or 703) of the performances of the musical, based on T. S. Eliot's ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats.'' He was on hand to buy one of Griddlebone's tails, which he found. But he was disappointed that he had missed the large pieces of cutlery used as props in the Gumbie Cat's tap-dancing routine.</p>
        <p>Leon Skorupski Jr., arrived from Bloomfield, N.J., in his custom-made Rum Tum Tugger costume, complete with spiked collar, calico-cat-colored mukluks, and a 45-minute makeup job. He frequently volunteers to wear the costume on visits to nursing homes, hospitals and in parades. When he first saw the show in January 1984, Mr. Skorupski said, he was drawn to the black cat who was ''always on the wrong side of every door.''</p>
        <p>He tells a story of how a resident of the Cedar Grove Manor nursing home got up from her wheelchair to dance with him, and he carries with him a copy of the New Jersey Senate resolution commending him for his volunteer service.</p>
        <p>His take for the day included some of Rum Tum Tugger's leotards, large Christmas tree lights from the Jellicle Ball scene, and a small cape of faux feline fur. ''You can be having a lousy day, and throw an outfit on, and you feel great,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Susan Powers, Marcy DeGonge Manfredi and Sally Ann Swarm, three performers who had each played the roles of Jennyanydots and Griddlebone, were in search of some of their old costumes. Anna McNeely, who was Jennyanydots for six and a half years, autographed a giant sandal from the junkyard for Stephanie Palmese. Ms. McNeely admitted that earlier, when a young fan talked to her at the sale about her role, she started to cry.</p>
        <p>''This is very strange,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Palmese's mother, Jane, who is from Miami, was holding a large crumpled coke can between her thumb and forefinger ($25) and handed it to the cashier.</p>
        <p>''They swarmed us,'' the cashier said after explaining to the Palmeses that the Rum Tum Tugger shoes were $75, even if they had been inadvertently placed in the $10 bin. ''But they're buying for a really good cause.''</p>
        <p>The proceeds from the sale benefited Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, which raises money for AIDS-related causes.</p>
