        <p>BETWEEN 1897 and 1927, nearly 11,000 Stanley Steamers were built and sold in the United States and overseas. And, some estimate there are between 400 to 600 still running after extensive restoration and repair.</p>
        <p>Some of those cars, originally made at Stanley Motor Carriage Company in Newton, Mass., have been reborn in Redding, thanks, in part, to a group of Stanley enthusiasts, guided by a father-son team who have had had a longtime interest in the vehicles.</p>
        <p>''In a 50-mile radius from here, probably about 30 Stanley Steamers are in operation,'' said Mark Herman of Redding, who, along with his father, Stuart Herman, have themselves partly or completely rebuilt 20 of them.</p>
        <p>Mark Herman, 35, who recently ended a two-year stint as chairman of the Stanley Museum in Kingfield, Me., has an obvious love for the car, which set the world speed record of 127.7 miles per hour in 1906.</p>
        <p>''With Stanley Steamers it's really just a hobby to us,'' Mark Herman said of he and his father.</p>
        <p>But Susan S. Davis, executive director of the Stanley Museum, said there was a bit more to Mark Herman's devotion than just a hobby.</p>
        <p>''He is one of the most knowledgeable people in the country about Stanleys,'' said Ms. Davis.</p>
        <p>His interest in the cars (and the museum) was heightened after he graduated from college and then attended a trade school in Boston called the North Bennet Street School. While still at that school, he completed the first car Stanley Steamer registry for the museum. It was a project he took over after a friend, who had started the project, had died.</p>
        <p>It was some 57 years ago when his father, 66, also of Redding, became the first Herman fascinated with a Stanley. Stuart Herman remembers clearly his first spark of interest:</p>
        <p>''I know I was 9 years old when a neighbor, Larry Ford, bought a Stanley Steamer. One day he was getting it ready for a journey. I walked over to watch him. Then he asked, 'Want to help me?' ''</p>
        <p>Usually it takes about a half-hour to get a Stanley rolling, including starting the burner, filling the boiler with water, getting operating steam pressure in the boiler. Two workers are better than one for all this, Stuart explained, continuing, ''So I hand-pumped water into the boiler while our neighbor Larry did the rest. Then he said, 'Well, since you helped me, want to take a ride?' ''</p>
        <p>''I never forgot the feeling when the steam hissed slightly as the throttle was advanced and we took off,'' the elder Herman said. ''Since that day I always wanted to own a Stanley Steamer.''</p>
        <p>Stanley lore holds that no two of them, when originally made, were exactly alike. Francis E. and Freelan O. Stanley, twins born in 1849 in the Maine town where the Stanley Museum stands today, were always improving their cars. (Tacking Steamer to the car's formal title  became popular after a l940's movie, ''Summer Holiday,'' which included a Stanley and starred Mickey Rooney and Gloria DeHaven.)</p>
        <p>The car has few mechanical parts, but with the steam, the amount of torque one produces is more than that of a V-8 engine. Stanleys never had transmissions and they have smooth, shiftless starts, cruising with only minor mechanical noise.</p>
        <p>The popularity of the steamer began to wane after Cadillac developed the self-starter for its gas-powered vehicles in 1912. With the amount of time needed to get a steamer started and ready to go, drivers moved quickly toward gas-powered cars when hand cranking was no longer needed.</p>
        <p>Mark Herman was only about 5 years old when he became enthralled with Stanleys, probably because of his father's interest. By this time, Stuart Herman had the means to acquire Stanley parts or cars. Stanley Steamers, which originally sold for $500 to $600 today can easily cost up to around $150,000 each, depending on the popularity of which of the 50 original models is being purchased. But, on average, the cars run about $40,000, the Hermans said.</p>
        <p>A true enthusiast, Stuart, who owns Stuart Herman Excavating, said, ''I plan to retire next fall from my business to work full time on Stanley Steamers.'' For their hobby, the Hermans primarily resuscitate the Stanley's wooden body and frame at Mark Herman's shop, Mark Herman House Wright, a home restoration business. Stuart Herman has owned a half-dozen of the cars and Mark currently owns one, too.</p>
        <p>The process of restoring a Stanley is handwork intensive. That work includes such jobs as hand-forging metal parts as a blacksmith would; refurbishing or making wooden seats; coppersmithing on water and fuel tanks; hand-soldering tanks and  hand-upholstering seats. Another Stanley enthusiast in the state is the Polish-born Jerzy E. Bolimowski of Ansonia. The Hermans said Mr. Bolimowski, an engineer-machinist, is ''very innovative and imaginative'' when it come to creating parts for the old Stanleys.</p>
        <p>In 1995 Stuart needed some Stanley components and learned of Mr. Bolimowski's work at his machine shop in Seymour called Urliz.</p>
        <p>''Jerzy often saw ways to improve anything we requested,'' Stuart Herman said, ''and we cautioned him this was O.K. for inside units, out of view, but parts should be historically authentic when visible from outside.''</p>
        <p>''There may only be 500 guys in the world with his great mechanical and technical skills,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bolimowski, now retired,  works on parts for the Stanleys out of his home workshop.</p>
        <p>Between the Hermans, experts on wood fabrication, and the metal-expert Mr. Bolimowski, Stanley parts have become a kind of currency. Mr. Bolimowski, who is also refurbishing his own Stanley, and the Hermans swap parts for their respective cars.  Mr. Bolimoski said he was more than halfway finished with the work on his own Stanley.</p>
        <p>Besides the Hermans and Mr. Bolimowski, there are several other individuals or companies that supply components or services for Stanley restoration in the state:</p>
        <p>* Neil A. Knecht of Newtown, who is a cabinetmaker with Mark's Herman's home restoration company, also helps reform wooden frames and bodies for the cars.</p>
        <p>* George H. Woike, Sr., of Harwinton, is a ''highly skilled pattern maker,'' Stuart Herman said, and he  often draws the necessary blueprints he or others first need to make wood, metal or plastic precision molds for the cars which eventually form cast-metal units.</p>
        <p>* The Commercial Foundry Company in New Britain makes metal castings for the Stanleys.</p>
        <p>* Eric C. Rook of Bethel, a farrier, also helps with the Stanleys. But he is so busy shoeing the growing horse population in western Connecticut and nearby New York state, the Hermans say it now takes advance planning to obtain his hand-wrought iron parts.</p>
        <p>Others who play a part in keeping the Stanley alive are the Pennsylvanian Amish and Mennonite handicrafters of traditional buggies. They supply the curved ash wood bows essential for supporting the fabric roofs of open Stanley touring models. And, a number of lumber distributors, especially in New Hampshire and Maine, keep a lookout for rare sizes or shapes of ash, oak, mahogany and other woods of special interest to the Redding group.</p>
        <p>There is also a machinist in England, John Goold of Bath, who makes special parts sometimes found in a Redding-revived Stanley Steamer.  Stuart Herman said he might visit Mr. Goold in the fall during his first trip to England.</p>
        <p>''Somehow, Stanley Steamers are very popular in that country, too,'' Mark Herman said.</p>
        <p>He and his father plan to help sponsor a steam auto meet next year in Connecticut. The Hermans said sites under consideration included Litchfield County and Lakeville. The first Stanley meet in Connecticut, Mark Herman said, was in the summer of 1955 in Lakeville when about 10 or 15 cars were present.</p>
        <p>The proposed meet, which Mark Herman expects to be over five days,  would include other steam-powered cars as well as the Stanleys. The Hermans expect upward of 50 cars and 250 people to attend.</p>
