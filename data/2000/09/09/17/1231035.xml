      <abstract>
        <p>Randy Cohen The Ethicist column answers questions on whether someone should allow full-time (but not live-in) baby sitter to use address to enroll her daughter in better school, whether it is wrong to look at young neighbor who showers and prepares for bed without drawing his blinds and whether it is unethical to leave newspaper on subway for someone else to read (M)</p>

        <p>My full-time (but not live-in) baby sitter hinted that she would like to use my address to enroll her daughter in my excellent local public elementary school; her neighborhood school is awful. The alternative is for her to send her daughter to private school, a financial burden but not an impossibility. Should I offer my address? -- L.A.B., Brooklyn</p>
        <p>You should not offer your address; it is not ethical to facilitate your baby sitter's fraud. It is, of course, entirely admirable to help her get her daughter into a good school, but there are better ways to do so. Help her apply for a variance that allows her daughter to attend an out-of-district school. Since that's an admittedly iffy proposition, see if the two of you can find any good schools or special programs in her district.</p>

        <p>My full-time (but not live-in) baby sitter hinted that she would like to use my address to enroll her daughter in my excellent local public elementary school; her neighborhood school is awful. The alternative is for her to send her daughter to private school, a financial burden but not an impossibility. Should I offer my address? -- L.A.B., Brooklyn</p>
        <p>You should not offer your address; it is not ethical to facilitate your baby sitter's fraud. It is, of course, entirely admirable to help her get her daughter into a good school, but there are better ways to do so. Help her apply for a variance that allows her daughter to attend an out-of-district school. Since that's an admittedly iffy proposition, see if the two of you can find any good schools or special programs in her district.</p>
        <p>That said, many districts, even in New York, a city with some excellent public schools, offer sadly limited choices. As a consequence, while what your baby sitter proposes is improper, I don't have it in me to chastise a mother's deception in trying to get her daughter a decent education. The best way to eliminate these sorts of address gymnastics is not through calls for individual rectitude, but by providing good schools in all neighborhoods. Sometimes a personal ethical goal -- a good education for your sitter's daughter -- can be achieved only through political action. So beyond the immediate steps you take on her behalf, I hope you and she actively support efforts for better public schools.</p>
        <p>If your sitter does opt for private school, you might help her apply for a scholarship or even, if you can afford it, aid her financially yourself.</p>
        <p>My neighbor, a 20-something and quite good-looking, never draws his blinds. The view from my apartment is extraordinary. Every night at 8:15 he returns from jogging to shower and prepare for bed, which I enjoy watching. Am I wrong to do so? -- Anonymous</p>
        <p>If the dreamboat across the way forgot one night to draw his blinds, you should respect his privacy; it would not be right to exploit a moment's carelessness. However, if he leaves them open every night in a big city where he obviously has neighbors, you can assume he knows what he's doing. Enjoy! It would be almost insulting to avert your glance. Like Central Park or the Chrysler Building, naked neighbors are part of the scenic splendor that is New York.</p>
        <p>Alas, while there may be no ethical impediment to your hobby, it is not without legal risk in some places for both the observed and the observer. New York State law, for example, proscribes various ''offenses against public sensibilities,'' and although one is unlikely to be convicted of such a charge, the arrest alone can be quite unpleasant.</p>
        <p>I love to find the day's paper on the subway seat next to me when I am caught without anything to read. Naturally, then, I feel inclined to leave my paper behind on the subway when I am done with it, despite the M.T.A.'s posted admonition against littering. Is it unethical to contribute to this silent network of newspaper readers? -- Luis Perez, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>Your volunteer subterranean bookmobile is the Transit Authority's litter. It is reasonable of them to ask riders not to strew newspapers around the subway; they must consider the possible effects of millions of riders leaving their papers behind. And while the commute would certainly be more pleasant if each train included a library car (and while we're at it, a bar car), until that utopian transit system arrives, you ought to follow the rules.</p>
