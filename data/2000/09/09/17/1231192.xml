        <p>Running for office as a Socialist is the ultimate exercise in egalitarianism, so Greg Pason, the Socialist Party USA's candidate for U. S. Senate seat from New Jersey, has no complaints about shuttling around the campaign trail aboard New Jersey Transit trains.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pason doesn't bemoan the fact that his job as the party's national secretary pays $12 an hour (the same figure as the party's proposed minimum wage) or that his budget for the primary was a paltry $1,370.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pason is a bit bewildered that with Election Day just seven weeks away, the candidate who many voters think of when they hear the word socialist is Jon Corzine, the Democratic candidate who is a former Wall Street chief executive worth $400 million.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Pason's past campaigns, his party's platform (based more on Western European Social Democracies than on Marxism or Leninism) made it simple to distinguish himself from his mainstream opponents. Health care? Mr. Pason proposed a government-financed medical program for everyone. Education? Preschool? Free, from cradle to grave.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Corzine running, Mr. Pason suddenly finds himself with formidable competition in the race to propose expansive social spending. Mr. Corzine has called for the government to provide universal preschool, free college tuition for any student with a B average or better and universal health care (although he later revised that promise to ''universal access at health care'').</p>
        <p>During the Democratic primary, former Gov. Jim Florio branded Mr. Corzine a ''bearded socialist.'' The Republican Senate nominee, Bob Franks, calls Mr. Corzine's ideas radical and extreme but stops short of invoking Karl Marx.</p>
        <p>In case anyone misses the implication, Chuck Haytaian, chairman of the state Republican Party, describes Mr. Corzine's platform as evidence of a socialistic mentality. While some of those comments were intended, at least partly, as barbed humor, Mr. Pason isn't amused.</p>
        <p>''Jon Corzine's using our language, calling for universal this and universal that, but he's really advocating more corporate welfare than anything else,'' Mr. Pason said. ''I mean, what is universal access to health care? Anyone can walk into an emergency room. The trouble is, thousands of people have no way to pay for the massive bills they'll face once they walk out.''</p>
        <p>Despite the fact that New Jersey has fared incredibly well during the current Wall Street boom, Mr. Pason believes his call for economic populism will resonate, especially on the issue of regulating health insurance companies. But it will be difficult for Mr. Pason to get his message out because Mr. Corzine has a gargantuan advantage in the ultimate capitalist tool: campaign money. Mr. Corzine spent $35 million in the primary, and is paying $1.2 million a week for television advertising. Mr. Pason's campaign operation is somewhat more modest.</p>
        <p>''I hand out a lot of leaflets and talk to a lot of people on street corners,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Pason's task sounds overwhelming, the odds are even more daunting for Nancy Rosenstock, the other Socialist in the race. Ms. Rosenstock is running as the standard bearer for the Socialist Workers' Party, which holds Cuba as its model of an enlightened government. She does not plan to file a report with the Federal Election Commission because her campaign will be run on less than $1,000.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosenstock acknowledges that her time on the trail has been limited by the demands of her job as a sewing machine operator in a garment factory, but she was stunned to hear her party's good name was being sullied by its association with a man as far removed from the means of production as Mr. Corzine.</p>
        <p>''I've never heard that,'' she said, howling with laughter. ''He's a millionaire, a hundred millionaire. That automatically disqualifies him. I can tell you that it's not the Socialists calling him that. It must be the conservative Republicans.''</p>
        <p>To Mr. Corzine, who hopes to appeal to the moderates who dominate New Jersey politics, such talk is encouraging. Despite the banquet of social spending Mr. Corzine proposes, he rejects the true Socialists' calls to slash the military budget and impose steep tax rates -- from 70 to 100 percent -- for anyone who earns more than $200,000 a year.</p>
        <p>In fact, the only major issue on which Mr. Corzine is to the left of the Socialists is gun control. He favors strict laws to curb the sale and possession of handguns, including licensing and registration firearms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pason said it was none of the government's business. Ms. Rosenstock, who believes that real change will not occur until there are uprisings like the civil rights movement, says ominously that the government has no right to disarm the people.</p>
        <p>While it is unlikely that Mr. Corzine will ever meet with the two card-carrying Socialist candidates to publicly compare their platforms, he and Mr. Pason did have a chance encounter recently as both candidates worked the same crowd at a public event on Labor Day.</p>
        <p>''When I introduced myself and told him I was running as a Socialist,'' Mr. Pason said, ''he told me, 'That's funny. some people say that I'm, a Socialist.' So I told him that if he'd invite me to the debate, I'd show the world what a real Socialist is, and make him look moderate.''</p>
        <p>Four days later, Mr. Corzine finally ended weeks of delays and agreed to a series of three debates with Mr. Franks, but Mr. Pason and Ms. Rosenstock were not invited. It's enough to make any self-respecting Socialist shave his beard in protest.</p>
