        <p>Suite 801 of the Pont Royal, according to a manager of the Left Bank hotel, is the only hotel room in Paris with a view over the entire city -- or at least its heart and its major monuments, from the Invalides to Sacre-Coeur to Notre-Dame. Among the viewing points in the suite, done in mauve toile de Jouy, are two terraces and even the bathroom, which has two windows.</p>
        <p>Whether or not that view is unique, standard and deluxe rooms on the sixth and seventh floors, cozily tucked under the mansard roof, offer delightful vistas over Paris rooftops. There is a total of 10 suites and 65 rooms, with two-line phones and in-room faxes and dataports. The decor in the gracious 1920's building is classic and understated, with rooms attractively done in tones of coffee, coral or plum.</p>

        <p>Suite 801 of the Pont Royal, according to a manager of the Left Bank hotel, is the only hotel room in Paris with a view over the entire city -- or at least its heart and its major monuments, from the Invalides to Sacre-Coeur to Notre-Dame. Among the viewing points in the suite, done in mauve toile de Jouy, are two terraces and even the bathroom, which has two windows.</p>
        <p>Whether or not that view is unique, standard and deluxe rooms on the sixth and seventh floors, cozily tucked under the mansard roof, offer delightful vistas over Paris rooftops. There is a total of 10 suites and 65 rooms, with two-line phones and in-room faxes and dataports. The decor in the gracious 1920's building is classic and understated, with rooms attractively done in tones of coffee, coral or plum.</p>
        <p>Reopened a year ago after a major renovation, the hotel added a small fitness center and massage room in the basement, and a conference room on the ground floor.</p>
        <p>In the past, there were sightings of Sartre and de Beauvoir in the hotel bar and spacious restaurant, Les Antiquaires, long a hangout for literary types. Today the lunch crowd is more likely to be politicians, journalists and fashion folk, as well as people from Gallimard, the publishing house just down the Rue de Montalembert; Antoine Gallimard himself lunches there often. Favorite dishes on the luncheon menu include beignets of crayfish and mushrooms ($14.50, at 7.53 francs to the dollar) and red fruits in sabayon sauce ($6.50). In the morning, the restaurant is a comfortable setting for an ample buffet breakfast ($20).</p>
        <p>Just off the Rue du Bac near its juncture with the Boulevard St.-Germain, the Pont Royal offers air-conditioning, pleasantly efficient service and an island of calm in this busy part of the Seventh Arrondissement. A few steps away is the Rue du Bac Metro stop, not unimportant given Paris's increasingly fierce traffic.</p>
        <p>Pont Royal Hotel, 7, rue de Montalembert; telephone (33-1) 42.84.70.00, fax (33-1) 42.84.71.00. Doubles $259 to $305; suites $425 to $597.</p>
