        <p>Philippe Starck, SoHo, April 4, 2000</p>
        <p>''For years, I have lived one-fourth in New York, one-fourth in Paris, one-fourth in Venice and one-fourth everywhere in the world. It's impossible today to live permanently in one city, because there are so many things to do around the world. It's an obsolete concept. But everywhere in the world I have the same clothes, the same books, the same music, the same bedsheets and the same thing in the refrigerator. We have, I think, 12 houses in the world and all of them have the same equipment. My motorcycle is the only way to get around in Manhattan. But to speak frankly, it isn't Manhattan that interests me. The center of Manhattan is very civilized, a nice international city. I am more interested in the passion of New York, and that's why I go with my motorcycle or bicycle to the Bronx, Queens and Harlem. There, you are like a spectator in front of the most beautiful drama in the world. Every corner of the street seems like an opera stage, a stage for drama. The vibrations there are very strong.''</p>
