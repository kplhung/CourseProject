        <p>Whom should you call when a tree or bush blocks a road sign? As Corinne and David Geffner recently discovered, it can be complicated.</p>
        <p>Corinne Geffner was in her house in June, she said, when she heard  cars crashing. She said she went outside and saw that two cars had collided at 82nd Avenue and Bell Boulevard in Hollis Hills, Queens; that accident, she said, did not surprise her.</p>
        <p>Ms. Geffner said she and her husband had been complaining to the city Parks Department and other agencies for months about a sycamore tree blocking a stop sign intended for westbound drivers on 82nd Avenue. She said they had even trimmed the tree themselves this summer. That June day, a young man in his early 20's had driven past the sign and into traffic on the boulevard. Before he was taken away in an ambulance, Ms. Geffner said, she heard him say, ''I didn't see the sign.''</p>
        <p>Bob Lawson, a Parks Department spokesman, said department records showed that Mr. Geffner first called to complain about the sycamore on July 7, then called again on July 18. He said a department inspector had gone to the corner on July 8 and found that the tree did, in fact, block the sign and should come down.</p>
        <p>But there was no immediate safety hazard, Mr. Lawson said, because of a ''stop ahead'' sign on 82nd Avenue about 100 feet before the intersection. He added that had the other sign not been there, the tree probably would have come down the next day. The department removed it on Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>The department's policy is to prune a tenth of the city's trees each year, which means a tree is likely to grow for 10 years before trimming. So the city relies on residents to report problems like signs that are blocked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lawson said it was best to notify the forestry office at the Parks Department in the borough where a problem is spotted. He added that no one should do what the Geffners admitted to doing: partly prune an offending tree themselves. If a tree is injured or killed, Mr. Lawson said, the pruner can face a $100 to $200 fine.</p>
        <p>Trees and bushes along state highways that run through the city, like the part of the Long Island Expressway that crosses Queens, are supposed to be maintained by the state Department of Transportation, which hires the city Department of Transportation to do the job. So which of the two departments should be called when a sign is blocked? The state for state roads, and the city for city streets.</p>
        <p>But it might be best to call the city.</p>
        <p>''I don't care if the road belongs to New York State or the Republic of China,'' said Anthony Fasulo, a commissioner with the city's Department of Transportation. ''If a sign is blocked and it's dangerous, we'll go and fix it.''</p>
