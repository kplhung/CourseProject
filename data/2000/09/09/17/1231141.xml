        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Elvis Mitchell notes that despite a record number of available screens, many good films never make it to local movie theaters [''Showing on a TV Near You,'' Sept. 3]. I would like to see many of those films, but I cannot fault the decision of commercial distributors or theater owners that it would not pay to take them on.</p>
        <p>The solution is to establish a not-for-profit film distribution association -- a national organization with local affiliates -- that would lease screens in multiplex theaters to show films that are deemed unsuitable for commercial distribution. If the commercial theaters are paid what they would ordinarily receive from a moderately remunerative screen, they would not lose money. And the not-for-profit film distributors could offset their losses by soliciting donations.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the model for how this might work is New York City's Film Forum, with its mix of new films and revivals. In much of the country, an alternative to commercial distribution is nonexistent; yet other art forms rely on the not-for-profit system. Film distribution needs a mixed system.</p>
