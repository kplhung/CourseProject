        <p>BACK home in the States, the Summer Games may be a temporary fascination on the television screen, with their emphasis on gold medals, plus the added suspense of post-match drug testing for performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
        <p>Who will be next?</p>
        <p>Multimillionaire team athletes may very well be handed a paper cup after their baseball or hockey or basketball or football games, according to the man who answers to the title of Czar.</p>
        <p>''We've got nine million transportation workers taking drug tests,'' said Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the director of the White House Drug Policy. ''We've got 1.5 million military people taking tests. Who says we can't test professional athletes?''</p>
        <p>Professional athletes could be tested one of these years, McCaffrey suggested, whether the commissioners and the unions and the club owners and the athletes like the concept.</p>
        <p>As the Games opened yesterday morning, McCaffrey and other United States officials announced that the federal government was releasing $3.3 million to finance the anti-doping program leading up to the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. McCaffrey and other American officials are here to be good guests and watch some competition, too. The original acrimony with the International Olympic Committee seems to have halted, at least while the Games are on.</p>
        <p>The Americans are here to watch how the Olympic community lurches toward more comprehensive scrutiny of drugs. However, this specialized segment of the athletic world is not their constituency.</p>
        <p>''The whole point is 16-year-old kids in Indiana and Uganda,'' McCaffrey said yesterday. ''I want them to reassess their position toward drugs in time for 2004. This is not about catching them cheating. This is about not using performance-enhancing drugs at all.''</p>
        <p>McCaffrey surely has enough to worry about with the influx of heroin and cocaine from across the borders to satisfy the twisted appetites of an affluent American public. But he has found time to talk zealously about the epidemic of performance-enhancing drugs, too.</p>
        <p>''We are finding that the use of steroids rose 50 percent in teen-age girls from 1998 to 1999,'' McCaffrey said yesterday. ''They are using them for the same reasons boys are, and they run the risk of hurting their bodies.''</p>
        <p>McCaffrey, who has the close-cropped white hair and intense stare of Steve McQueen in his later years, is eager to clear up misconceptions about his homeland.</p>
        <p>''People have the impression that drugs are most prevalent in the inner city,'' McCaffrey said. ''But that's not true. It's all of us. It's your children.''</p>
        <p>Now the fear is that America's children will emulate the athletes in the big-time leagues, as well as the so-called Olympic athletes, who develop giant muscles, lower their times dramatically, look good in swimsuits, only to undermine their future health.</p>
        <p>''I consider athletes to be role models,'' said Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of Health and Human Services, who is also here. ''Olympic sports are not an exception.''</p>
        <p>When Shalala was president of Hunter College, a small municipal college in Manhattan, she encountered drug testing when it done mainly with employees. When she became the president of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, she had to come to recognize performance-enhancing drugs in big-time college sports.</p>
        <p>Now she is promoting programs that discourage smoking and encourage physical activity. She was thrilled that the Olympic oath, recited by one select athlete at Friday's opening ceremony, included a commitment to avoid drugs. But nobody is naive. The athletes and the rest of the world know that medals will be won by people who have better chemists than people who finish down the pike.</p>
        <p>''It used to be the second-rate athletes who cheated,'' McCaffrey said. ''Now it's the best ones, too.''</p>
        <p>McCaffrey cares only peripherally how many athletes test positive for drugs at these Summer Games. This is not about the 40 Chinese who canceled out of these Games for a variety of strange reasons, although McCaffrey said he sent a letter to Chinese officials praising them for leaving athletes home. Obviously, China is trying to look clean in time for next year's vote for the 2008 host.</p>
        <p>He has hopes for the new U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, and its chairman, the former Olympic marathon champion, Frank Shorter. McCaffrey also claims to be pleased with the World Anti-Doping Agency, and its chairman, Richard Pound of Canada, praising the new I.O.C. testing for EPO, the hormone that creates extra endurance.</p>
        <p>Not many months ago, McCaffrey was jousting with the I.O.C., and Pound was replying that America had its own problems what with Mark McGwire jerking 70 homers in a season while ingesting the steroid-laden substance known as androstenedione.</p>
        <p>''Andro is not illegal in baseball,'' McCaffrey said yesterday. ''although it probably deserves to be banned. It's a huge problem because children 10 to 18 are trying things.''</p>
        <p>McCaffrey said he believes the United States could eventually force testing of professional athletes, perhaps by tying in the dangers to athletes, spectators and officials from somebody competing under the influence of something or other.</p>
        <p>''You wouldn't want a bobsledder going down the hill after smoking marijuana,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The same argument could be made for more prominent athletes. The raised dialogue in drugs may not go away when the Olympic flame is extinguished in two weeks.</p>
