        <p>IT is always interesting to see the results when several artists are given a project in common. Their efforts begin with some similarities, and then their imaginations and proclivities go to work. At the Hammond Museum here, ''Unfolding Visions'' displays the results of giving artists  ''fan paper'' to work on. The paper was then made into the 10-ribbed fans used primarily in Japanese dance.</p>
        <p>The force behind the sprightly exhibition is the Print Exchange Association, a worldwide group of artists and print organizations, which celebrated its 10th anniversary two years ago in Japan. The traditional Japanese fan is thus a fit and obvious way to commemorate this milestone.</p>

        <p>IT is always interesting to see the results when several artists are given a project in common. Their efforts begin with some similarities, and then their imaginations and proclivities go to work. At the Hammond Museum here, ''Unfolding Visions'' displays the results of giving artists  ''fan paper'' to work on. The paper was then made into the 10-ribbed fans used primarily in Japanese dance.</p>
        <p>The force behind the sprightly exhibition is the Print Exchange Association, a worldwide group of artists and print organizations, which celebrated its 10th anniversary two years ago in Japan. The traditional Japanese fan is thus a fit and obvious way to commemorate this milestone.</p>
        <p>The Hammond Museum, the first stop in the United States for the exhibition, is an appropriate venue because one of its constant attractions is its Japanese stroll garden. The museum also has a historical collection of hundreds of fans, some of which are on display now in the large gallery to provide comparison and contrast with the contemporary ones.</p>
        <p>The fans are displayed on several lattice screens that surround the gallery. From a distance the host of shallow arcs looks like a gathering of colorful butterflies. Because of the insistent sameness of their form, it is easy to survey them cursorily. This would be a mistake, for it is instructive and pleasurable to pick out themes running through the show and note how different artists treat it.</p>
        <p>Nature is, not surprisingly, the most ubiquitous theme. Kouichi Kitamura treats nature subtly in traditional Japanese fashion by printing on his fan with wood block a single branch bearing a single pink bud. Doreen Halsall of Croton-on-Hudson answers this, as it were, by drawing a rather aggressive bare branch as it would appear in winter. She gives it the appearance of volume through strategic additions of gold leaf. Another bracing comparison is the overall evocation of pale blue water, which fills the fan of Judy Mensch of Manhattan, contrasted with the more rugged, hallowed marine subject of rocks and sea drawn by Danielle Thompson of Saratoga Springs, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A traditional device in fans is the emphasis on a single object, making it a symbol by isolating it in the composition. The captivating form in the colorful composition by Gloria Garfinkel of Manhattan resembles a ginkgo leaf, which itself resembles the fan shape. Jyh-Ming Kung from Taiwan concentrates viewers' attention on a scallop shell, while a second fan by him features a red disc hovering above a welter of black lines. This arrangement brings to mind, probably unintentionally, the typical imagery of the Abstract Expressionist Adolph Gottlieb. Another composition of splattered forms, by Shiou-Ping Liao from China, recalls another Abstract Expressionist, Sam Francis.</p>
        <p>Another theme, represented more sparely, is images that reinforce the fan's physical characteristics. The primarily green, organic shapes in the fan by Norimasa Mizutani from Japan are a strong counterpoint to the rigorous angularity of a fan's folds. The angular shapes that fly across the fan by Shyh-Twan Hwang from Taiwan seem like the regular segments of a fan set free. A throng of galloping horses by Vijay Kumar of Manhattan is rendered simply, recalling cave drawings.</p>
        <p>Other fans speak to the object's history and use in a narrative way. Yoshisuke Funasaka from Japan made contour drawings with a thick black line of a bevy of nude women in various poses that might make viewers think of geishas. Jin-Song Yang from China paints full-fledged watercolor scenes of life at court. A pair of flirtatious eyes decorate the fan by Carla Weisberg from the United States. Junko Yamashita from Japan takes this further with the depiction of two comically chubby faces kissing. Michail Parshicov from Russia depicts a couple as a single stylized coil spanning his fan's surface.</p>
        <p>Imagery might be a reminder of conditions opposite those in which fans flourish. Warawoot Shusaenethong from Thailand is represented by two fans with massive heads with open mouths; the figures strangely seem oppressed. Dai Kobayashi and Mitsuru Nagashima, both from Japan, evoke demons in heavy black line. Mr. Nagashima's fantastic animal seems to be a combination boar and dragon. Viewers must keep in mind that creatures that look fearsome to us in the West are often beneficent in Asian cultures.</p>
        <p>One of the more intriguing categories is the use of computer technology. Audrey Martynov from Russia came up with a foot that appears to be running, something that also speaks to the rapid movement of a fan in use.</p>
        <p>More complex is the modern evocation of tarot cards, in which the figures are rather robotic by Dale Leifestre of Mount Vernon. The formidable heads on the fan by Thomas Halsall of Croton-on-Hudson seem to have been borrowed from the Sistine ceiling, and viewers might experience the odd physical sensation of such massiveness being easily folded or collapsed.</p>
        <p>One fan stands out from the rest on its concept and execution, and it might be a tribute to American ingenuity. Paul Villinski of Long Island City made a collage of the many rejection letters he has received in the course of trying to show his art. What this has to do with a fan is a matter of conjecture, but it might help him cool down after being turned down.</p>
        <p>''Unfolding Visions'' is at the Hammond Museum in North Salem through Oct. 28. The number to call for information is (914) 669-5033.</p>
