        <p>Name: The Gillespies  Ages: 15, 12, 8  Coming from: California  Looking for: A new home</p>
        <p>In their apartment in Washington Heights, where they moved a year ago from Santa Monica, the good-natured Gillespie children are showing me their reptiles. Nadine, 15, presents her leopard geckos, and Zo, 8, shows off two corn snakes and recounts how her animal-loving dad once smuggled them by airplane in a backpack. Then Max, 12, introduces me to his tarantula, Indey.</p>
        <p>''In California, I could hold her,'' Max says. ''But since she moved here, she's had an attitude problem. She's becoming a real New Yorker.'' To demonstrate what that means, he moves a stick over Indey in a menacing way. Soon, of course, she is rearing up fiercely and exposing her two little black fangs.</p>
        <p>''But Max, in California you were more gentle with her, so she never did that,'' little Zo protests.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, Max,'' Nadine adds. ''I think you're the one becoming the real New Yorker.''</p>
        <p>Of the three Gillespie children, Max seems to have faced the most difficult trials since moving here. In California, he played in Little League, Rollerbladed everywhere and was respected throughout his school for his knowledge of animals. Here, he was teased mercilessly at P.S./I.S. 187, a traditional neighborhood school around the corner. Because his name is Gillespie, some kids decided to call him ''Gay-lesbian.'' He made the mistake, at first, of letting people see he was upset, and that made things worse. But Max soldiered on, applying himself, getting a new, spiky haircut and making his mother buy baggier clothes that fall off him properly. Still, he was teased right through the last day of school, when some kid beat him up for getting a 96 in science on his report card.</p>
        <p>''A lot of kids would have lost it,'' says his mom, Jenny, who along with her husband, Gwain, decided that relocating to New York for his job with Sony Music would provide a richer and more stimulating life for their children. ''But Max is a survivor. He really tries to make things work, and he has a great sense of humor that comes in very handy around here.''</p>
        <p>That's not to say that, like his sisters, Max doesn't pine for Santa Monica, where you can ride your bike to Venice Beach or see your friends without making play dates or buy crickets for your pets without having to get on a subway to a proper pet store. But unlike his sisters, for all his skin-thickening Max also seems buoyed by the challenges of city life. Last spring, a buddy from Santa Monica came for a visit and couldn't sleep because of all the noise outside. ''I just told him, 'That's the rhythm of the New York Streets,''' Max says.</p>
        <p>His sisters have had a harder time finding the sunny side. Zo misses her beach and mall terribly, and only now is getting used to wearing shoes all the time. Nadine, who was very popular in Santa Monica and on the local swim team there, gets called ''Ghetto'' at Beacon High School on West 61st Street because she lives in Washington Heights. ''I just wish my parents had shown us what it was like here before we moved,'' she sighs. ''California is so much better for kids. Now it's too late to move back. That would be too weird.''</p>
        <p>''Dad says give it a year and you'll start to like it here,'' Max tells her.</p>
        <p>''It's been a year,'' Nadine says, ''and I don't like it.''</p>
        <p>''Neither do I,'' Zo adds.</p>
        <p>From the perspective of a hemmed-in New Yorker, the Gillespies live in a wonderful place. Castle Village is an apartment complex on quiet Cabrini Boulevard with seven acres of lawn overlooking the Hudson River. But there is trouble in this small paradise. The elegant old women who live here and who for years have shared Washington Heights (which has become a much safer area with the fall of the crack trade in the last five years) with the more recently arrived Dominicans do not always take kindly to the kids. ''The old ladies like quiet,'' says Zo, who is walking around the grounds wrapped in her three-foot albino snake. ''We're only allowed to use this little bit of the grass for playing.'' Nadine adds, sotto voce, ''I hear the one with the window box in that apartment over there has a gun.''</p>
        <p>Baseball is restricted; tree climbing is not allowed. ''Because we don't have friends nearby, we're on top of each other all day, and sometimes it gets unbearable,'' Nadine says. Zo adds, ''We just have so many more opportunities to annoy each other.'' Even Max nods in agreement. ''There's nothing to do around here,'' he says. ''And what good is a lawn if you can't play on it?''</p>
        <p>But after a moment Max's focus turns to the top of the George Washington Bridge, rising up over the treetops like the summit of a nearby mountain. ''When there's a thunderstorm, we can see big wide forks of lightning hitting that bridge,'' he says. ''In California, the weather's always the same. But here, giant dark clouds come rolling in from out of nowhere, and then there's a storm. New York is just full of surprises.''</p>
        <p>It is indeed. Nadine, for instance, was shocked when she first heard a black person speaking Spanish on the streets of Washington Heights. Zo, who goes to P.S. 176 at 204th Street, didn't know how nice a well-heated home feels in the winter or anything about snow. (''It's much easier to make a ball with snow than with sand,'' she informs me.) None of the children knew -- and this surprised their parents, too -- how serious school could be here and how much work it entails. ''I'm a big believer in public schooling, and a New York City education is superior to Santa Monica, at least in the schools we found for our kids,'' Jenny says. ''There's more discipline in the classrooms, and the parents are much more involved as volunteers.'' Even Nadine has to concede that school is better here. ''I learned more in one year here than I did in four there,'' she says. Zo, on the other hand, still finds the masses of kids she must confront at school overwhelming. ''There are people everywhere,'' she says, ''and a lot of times they're pushing in line.''</p>
        <p>Not a day goes by when Jenny doesn't think back to the ease of her kids' lives in Santa Monica and question herself for moving them to such an inhospitable and physically overwhelming city. But then she sees the ways in which they have grown, and she looks especially to Max who, in the plucky tradition of hundreds of years of successful immigrants, faces hardship with his chin up and takes great satisfaction in the small ways in which the city accepts him.</p>
        <p>Here, for instance, is Terry Fivos, the owner of a pizza place on West 187th. He is as big as a wrestler and meaner-looking than a Hell's Angel. Max wants to introduce him to me, but he is busy counting money and can't be bothered. Slowly, grudgingly, he turns to acknowledge us. He growls hello, and then his voice softens as he tells me that Max is far more polite than the old people in the neighborhood who don't know when to leave him alone. He says that whenever the kids from P.S./I.S. 187 come in for pizza, he always serves Max first (the $3 special) because he lives right around the corner. He lays a big hairy paw on Max's shoulder. ''You're always welcome here,'' he says to him. ''This is your neighborhood, Max. This is where you belong.''</p>
        <p>Walking back to his apartment, Max (who is enrolling this fall at I.S. 44, a magnet school on the Upper West Side) is glowing with pride. But when a gang of dubious-looking kids start yelling from across the street, he stiffens abruptly. ''Are they yelling at me?'' he asks with trepidation. I tell him they aren't, and he relaxes and smiles. ''That's just the New York lingo, I guess,'' he says, and with the confident stride of a man about town, he heads for home.</p>
