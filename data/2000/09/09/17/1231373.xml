        <p>It's not only younger workers who are flying the corporate coop.</p>
        <p>Job switching has also been on the rise lately among experienced managers and executives. And the lures are more than just the promise of higher pay.</p>
        <p>''While money remains a major factor in deciding where to work, more often the important consideration is whether the company offers flexible scheduling, telecommuting and other family-friendly policies like helping with elder care and child care,'' said John A. Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, which keeps track of employee turnover.</p>
        <p>Among managers and executives who are at least 45 years old, about a third, on average, reported working at four or more companies during their careers, according to the company's survey of 3,000 managers for the four quarters ended on June 30. That number was up from a four-quarter average of 23 percent recorded during 1991.</p>
