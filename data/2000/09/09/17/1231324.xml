        <p>IN the spring of 1996, the zealous new Republican majority in Congress persuaded President Clinton to sign a farm bill intended to wean American farmers from the government subsidies on which they had relied so heavily for so long.</p>
        <p>Given that price supports, land set-asides and other aid were then costing Washington $7.3 billion a year -- and today's budget surpluses were not yet a gleam in even the most optimistic eye -- it seemed like a good idea. It just hasn't worked out.</p>
        <p>This year, the government is expected to pay farmers $22.7 billion, more than triple the pre-overhaul level, accounting for 40 percent of farmers' net cash income. Some self-reliance.</p>
        <p>That 1996 bill, the Freedom to Farm Act, began the shift from New Deal-era price-support programs to a more free-market approach at a time when crop prices were at 10-year highs. The idea was to let farmers choose what to grow based on what could be sold in the United States or overseas, not what the government would promise to buy.  But subsidies were not eliminated. And the law wound up simply encouraging the world's most productive farmers to produce even more bin-busting crops, sending prices into a deep slump.</p>
        <p>Oddly, though, the government is also making more payments to farmers to compensate them for natural disasters that kept some of them from adding even more surplus crops to glutted markets, like the drought that has plagued Texas, other parts of the Southwest and portions of the Southeast this summer, hitting cotton and pecan crops especially hard. Farmers hold a special place in the American psyche, and Congress is particularly reluctant to stint on relief in a presidential election year. More than a third -- $8.9 billion -- of aid to farmers this year will be disaster relief.</p>
        <p>But the larger factor in the bump-up in spending is the bumper crops, especially of corn and soybeans, which are both expected to be up nearly 10 percent, to record levels.</p>
        <p>''There's been a lot written about the drought, but we're still going to have a big harvest,'' said Jonathon P. Braatz, a senior vice president at George K. Baum &amp; Company, a brokerage house in Kansas City, Mo. (Another analyst in the Midwest, where growing conditions have been almost ideal, said one farmer had called this summer's conditions the ''wettest drought'' he had ever seen.)</p>
        <p>The 1996 legislation ''didn't do what the designers had hoped,'' said Jack Hervey, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. ''Each year we're seeing larger appropriations for agriculture,'' he said, because ''the strength of the safety net is encouraging crop production.''</p>
        <p>With granaries still swollen with last year's crops and foreign demand far below what was envisioned by the 1996 legislation, grain prices are depressed for a fourth consecutive year. Specialists say the price of soybeans could slide to the lowest level since 1971. The wheat harvest did shrink slightly this year, but prices are nonetheless expected to approach 14-year lows.</p>
        <p>THE low crop prices that distress farmers, of course, also save money for consumers, and help the Federal Reserve keep overall inflation at bay without raising interest rates further. Over the last 12 months, the food component of the Consumer Price Index -- accounting for 15 percent of the market basket -- has climbed just 2.7 percent, while other components have risen 3.4 percent.</p>
        <p>This price restraint seems particularly timely as a partial offset to the cost of energy, mainly oil and natural gas, which has jumped 13.1 percent in the last year. Energy, which makes up 7 percent of the price index, is also a big cost to farmers.</p>
        <p>But indirectly, consumers do share farmers' pain at low prices. ''Consumers are also taxpayers, and taxpayers are to a certain degree bailing the farmers out'' with support payments, Mr. Braatz said.</p>
        <p>The farm equipment business also suffers. The stock of John Deere, a major producer of tractors and other agricultural equipment, has lost one-third of its value since its 52-week high in May. Last week, however, three Wall Street analysts, seeing a bottom, made fresh appraisals: Two called the stock a ''buy,'' and one rated it ''attractive.''</p>
        <p>Few analysts see a major farm-sector rebound on the horizon, and specialists are already wondering what fixes Washington will seek in the Freedom to Farm Act, which expires in 2002.</p>
        <p>''We got rid of deficiency payments, which rise as commodity prices fall,'' said Fred Nelson, a Department of Agriculture economist. ''But other price-sensitive payments have since become operational, as prices sagged in the late 90's.''</p>
