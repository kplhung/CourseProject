        <p>Why We Hurt</p>
        <p>The Natural History of Pain.</p>
        <p>By Frank T. Vertosick Jr.</p>
        <p>292 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Harcourt. $24.</p>
        <p>In 1979, while training for the Boston marathon, I ruptured a lumbar disc. I underwent two failed operations and was left disabled and in severe pain. It took many months of arduous physical therapy to be weaned from pain medication and to regain the ability to move about. To this day, if I lift something heavy without bending correctly, or fail to support my muscles when sitting in a soft chair, I am laid low by back pain. It was, therefore, with more than academic interest, and some trepidation, that I read ''Why We Hurt.'' To my surprise and delight, Dr. Frank T. Vertosick Jr., a practicing neurosurgeon, performs a feat of literary alchemy. He transmutes the lugubrious subject of pain into a provocative and edifying treatise that tightly engages the reader.</p>
        <p>The types of pain profiled range from the common, like migraine, angina pectoris and ruptured disc, to the arcane, like tic douloureux and phantom limb pain. Each chapter is a triptych, presenting a clinical case, the relevant biology and the way different cultures have viewed the disorder. The cases of patients in pain and the biology are explained in accessible lay language, and with the voice of an authority in the field. The probing of the cultural significance of pain is a riskier enterprise, since here Vertosick steps down from the expert's pedestal. Yet it is this dimension that most challenges both the author and the reader: How do we find meaning, if at all, in the experience of pain?</p>
        <p>Vertosick, raised in the Roman Catholic tradition, fashions his response by first rebutting the Christian thinker C. S. Lewis, who saw pain as God's megaphone, broadcasting a call to man to worship him. ''Unfortunately,'' he writes, ''the megaphone merely makes God akin to a firefighter who commits arson just to play hero by later extinguishing the flames, or like a nurse who poisons patients to feel the joy of resuscitating them.''</p>
        <p>As a scientist, Vertosick knows pain is a biological necessity: ''In the simplest sense, pain protects us from bodily harm. Dangerous things are hurtful things, and pain pushes us if we take excessive risks or push our bodies past their physical limits.'' Given this thesis, Vertosick tries to assign a Darwinian rationale to each type of human pain. In some cases, pain provides a survival advantage to our species, as after trauma. Other instances seem to escape Darwinian logic, like the pains of childbirth. Vertosick flatly states his bewilderment about why women suffer so during labor, and then challenges the cultural celebration of ''natural'' delivery: ''Curiously, few people question the wisdom of using medical technology to cause painless death, yet many question the wisdom of using the same technology to achieve painless birth. . . . True, labor pain is brief, at most a day or two in duration, but it's also extreme. In quantitative ratings of pain severity, the pain of a first labor exceeds cancer pain by a considerable margin and falls just shy of the pain of a limb amputation sans anesthesia. Why endure such torment willingly? No rational person would want to have a leg cut off without benefit of modern painkilling technique, yet thousands of women pay money to learn how to avoid anesthesia during childbirth. The pain is no different than any other pain . . . or is it?''</p>
        <p>Looking to other cultures for possible answers, Vertosick notes: ''Tribes in northern Russia had a curious custom. During difficult labors, husband and wife had to discuss details of their sexual affairs with others. This unpleasantness presumably stimulated both parties to keep the labor, and conversation, as short as possible. Pain may play the same role: speed. The mother knows what she must do to end the pain -- deliver the baby. Like the caller on a rowing team, the pain yells through its megaphone for her to keep stroking toward the finish line.''</p>
        <p>Humans are different from other animals. We make conscious choices about pain. We also experience pain as more than physical because of our unique cognitive capacities. This psychological dimension of pain is termed suffering. Anticipation, Vertosick contends, is the cognitive core of suffering. To support his argument, he refers to Christ in Gethsemane, who sweats blood in pondering his future crucifixion.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Christology is used as a leitmotif throughout the book to capture the visceral dimensions of human suffering. Carpal tunnel syndrome, occurring with increased frequency from repetitive strain injury during computer work, is explained by Vertosick using the clinical details of a Roman crucifixion. Contrary to depictions in much medieval art, where nails are driven through Jesus' hands, the expert Roman torturers knew that this placement would not fulfill their aim of maximizing pain; the limbs would simply rip off and the victim's suffering would be cut short. Instead, nails were driven just below the wrists, so as to fix the victim on the cross while exerting maximum trauma to nerves, tendons and bones. Carpal tunnel syndrome exerts its pathology at this precise sensitive anatomical intersection.</p>
        <p>Surgeons are among the most pragmatic of physicians, and a surgeon whose career has focused on pain learns to endorse treatments enthusiastically even when their scientific underpinnings are obscure. Vertosick is open-minded on alternative medicine, particularly acupuncture and herbal tonics. Even magnets, which he says exert insufficient fields to affect the functioning of nerves, are given their due. He believes that, like placebos, they alter the psyche's perception of pain, and he endorses the placebo effect as a powerful method of effective pain management.</p>
        <p>Pain is an unwelcome but unavoidable companion in our lives. As Vertosick graphically illustrates -- and as I discovered 20 years ago -- it can become a cruel master of the body and mind, threatening to snuff out virtually all of life's joys. Paradoxically, it can also be an important teacher, albeit of lessons we would prefer to learn in other ways. Instead of a megaphone summoning us to divine worship, it can focus our attention not only on our own plight, but also open our hearts to the suffering of others, deepening our empathy and defining our humanity.</p>
