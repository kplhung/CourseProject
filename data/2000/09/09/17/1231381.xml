        <p>Irritated by the decision of neighboring Guyana to allow an American company to build a satellite-launching center in territory that Venezuela claims as its own, President Hugo Chavez has revived a long-dormant border dispute.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez maintains that the planned space site is a Trojan horse that threatens Venezuela's security by enabling the United States to establish a military presence along his country's vulnerable eastern flank.</p>
        <p>But he also describes the project as an affront to Venezuela's sovereignty, arguing that the real border between the two countries is the Essequibo River and that Guyana should be forced to relinquish some two-thirds of its 83,000 square miles.</p>
        <p>''That territory is ours,'' he said last month.</p>
        <p>Though he pledged ''a policy of peace and calm'' and promised there would be no war, he also accused the Guyanese government of having made a deal under the table and warned that Venezuela ''will not allow this base'' to be built.</p>
        <p>Since taking office 19 months ago, Mr. Chavez, a former army colonel who in 1992 led an unsuccessful coup, has made the Essequibo issue a personal crusade. In what is clearly a reference to the dispute, a new constitution drawn up at his insistence states that the only borders Venezuela recognizes as valid are those established by ''treaties and arbitrators' rulings not flawed by nullity.''</p>
        <p>Venezuela has claimed the region, believed rich in minerals and oil, since gaining independence from Spain early in the 19th century. In 1899 an international tribunal awarded most of the territory to Britain, then the colonial power in Guyana, but Venezuela has periodically protested the outcome, and in 1983 the matter was referred to the United Nations. The latest United Nations  envoy appointed to try to resolve the dispute, Oliver Jackman, called on both sides last month to ''tone down the rhetoric.'' The recent increase in tension has created ''grounds for alarm,'' he said on a visit here.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Chavez has repeatedly described the site as an American military base, both Guyana and the American company involved in the deal, Beal Aerospace Technologies, say that is not correct. In May, the Guyanese government signed an agreement with the private concern that would allow it to launch satellites from the site if the United States government approves the export of sensitive technology.</p>
        <p>''We will need to get export licenses in order to build on the site and bring rockets out of the United States for launching from the site,'' chosen because of its proximity to the Equator, said David Spoede, a spokesman for the company. ''Typically, the State Department requires that a U.S. government observer be present to prevent proliferation of missile technology,'' but Mr. Chavez's accusation of a military base ''couldn't be further from the truth.''</p>
        <p>President Bharrat Jagdeo of Guyana met with Mr. Chavez at a conference of South American leaders in Brasilia this month. ''I gave him a copy of the contract so that he could see for himself that there is no intention, or anything written into it, that would allow the establishment of an American base,'' Mr. Jagdeo said after the meeting.</p>
        <p>Some Venezuelan critics of Mr. Chavez, like former President Carlos Andres Perez, have dismissed the campaign as part of a ''policy of permanent confrontation'' intended to distract the country's 24 million people from mounting economic and social problems. ''It's absurd,'' Mr. Perez said of the border claim in a television interview. ''It is impossible to regain that territory.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez's insistence on pursuing the claim has generated concern throughout Latin America, where several other border disputes remain unresolved, and in the English-speaking Caribbean.</p>
        <p>Despite the Venezuelan warnings, Guyana has made it clear that it intends to move ahead with the space project. With only 850,000 people, the country is trying to attract foreign investment and diversify its economy, which depends heavily on mining and agriculture.</p>
