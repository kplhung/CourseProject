        <p>President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru announced unexpectedly last night that he was calling new elections and would not be a candidate.</p>
        <p>In a nationally televised speech that surprised his countrymen, the embattled Peruvian leader also said that he would deactivate the National Intelligence Service, whose powerful head was accused on Thursday of offering bribes to an opposition congressman.</p>
        <p>''I have made the decision, first, to deactivate the system of national intelligence and, in second place, call a general election immediately, in which I will not stand,'' said Mr. Fujimori, who started a third five-year term only seven weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the announcement, The Associated Press reported from Lima, hundreds of people gathered outside the presidential palace, chanting anti-Fujimori slogans and demanding that the authoritarian president, who has ruled Peru since 1990, leave office. There were no immediate reports of violence.</p>
        <p>If the 62-year-old leader follows through on his promise to step down, he would end a decade of his increasingly authoritarian leadership of Peru.</p>
        <p>During his time in office, Mr. Fujimori overcame a powerful Marxist insurgency, tamed hyperinflation and forged what may be a lasting peace with one of Peru's historic enemies, Ecuador.</p>
        <p>But, he was increasingly criticized for governing autocratically, with emasculated courts and congress, long after the guerrilla threat had subsided.</p>
        <p>Serious charges of fraud marred his election last May, and his inauguration in July was marked by riots, arson, the deaths of six people and the arrests of 172.</p>
        <p>The president said he hoped that his decision would be ''welcomed by the international organizations.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, senior Clinton administration officials who had heard indications of Mr. Fujimori's decision earlier in the evening said that they were relieved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori won his latest term in a runoff election in May that was boycotted by the opposition and condemned internationally as flawed.</p>
        <p>Alejandro Toledo, the leading presidential opponent of Mr. Fujimori, charged that the National Intelligence Service had orchestrated a fraudulent signature campaign to get Mr. Fujimori on the ballot this spring, then lead a smear and harassment campaign against the opposition. Even though Mr. Toledo boycotted the runoff, Mr. Fujimori received only 51 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>In June the Organization of American States sent a high-level delegation to Peru, urging, among other things, that Mr. Fujimori fire the head of the Intelligence Service, Vladimiro Montesinos. The Peruvian leader refused, claiming in one response that his intelligence chief had close contacts with the United States Central Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
        <p>But last week, a videotape surfaced that apparently showed Mr. Montesinos giving a large cash bribe to an opposition congressman, in an effort to win his defection to the government side.</p>
        <p>The congressman, Luis Alberto Kouri, has denied accepting $15,000 to join the government ranks. A number of members of Parliament have switched sides, giving Mr. Fujimori a majority in Congress.</p>
        <p>Earlier yesterday, the Organization of American States said that the allegations of top-level corruption in Peru were of ''utmost seriousness and demanded ''quick and severe'' action from Mr. Fujimori.</p>
        <p>Opposition parties said yesterday that they had suspended O.A.S.-brokered talks with the government designed to boost the accountability and credibility of Peruvian institutions until Mr. Fujimori took action in the mounting ''video of shame'' scandal. On Friday, the American ambassador to Peru, John Hamilton, also urged Mr. Fujimori to take ''clear and energetic steps to restore public confidence in the intelligence services.''</p>
        <p>On television last night, Mr. Fujimori, smiling and looking at ease, did not announce a date for the new elections but said they were necessary after the political uproar over the videotape.</p>
        <p>A leading opposition congressman, Henry Pease, questioned whether the president could carry out his promise and said that it could be that Mr. Montesinos, long considered the power behind the government, would stay and Mr. Fujimori go.</p>
        <p>Opposition to Mr. Fujimori's increasingly autocratic ways grew after the government-controlled Congress in 1997 fired three of the seven members of Peru's Constitutional Tribunal, the nation's rough equivalent of the United States Supreme Court. This purge of the court paved the way for Mr. Fujimori to run for a third term, although Peru's Constitution limited presidents to two terms.</p>
        <p>Much of the re-election strategy seemed to be in the hands of Mr. Montesinos, a close aide since 1990, when Mr. Fujimori beat the author Mario Vargas Llosa to win his first term in office.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Montesinos had been ousted as an army officer in the 1970's for suspected espionage, he wielded enormous influence over Peru's powerful military. In the months before the most recent election, he handpicked top army commanders.</p>
