        <p>The post office promises that ''neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of nights stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.'' Lawsuits are not on that list, however, and one has stopped the mailman, at least for now.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 7, District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein ordered the United States Postal Service to halt construction of the new Ansonia post office and mail distribution center, on West 68th Street near Columbus Avenue.

        <p>The post office promises that ''neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of nights stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.'' Lawsuits are not on that list, however, and one has stopped the mailman, at least for now.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 7, District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein ordered the United States Postal Service to halt construction of the new Ansonia post office and mail distribution center, on West 68th Street near Columbus Avenue. The work will be stayed until the service either supplements a 1992 environmental impact statement, prepared for the project, or explains why the eight-year-old assessment, which found that there would be ''no significant impact'' on local traffic, noise or air quality from the station, is still valid.</p>
        <p>The Coalition for a Livable West Side, which brought the Federal suit last fall along with some residents, claims that an explosion of development since 1992 has made traffic congestion in the area much worse. It says that 24-hour loading docks and constant comings and goings of trucks at the new post office would make the problem worse.</p>
        <p>''We contend there have been major changes in the neighborhood since then,'' Jack Lester, the coalition's lawyer, said of the 1992 assessment. A traffic study commissioned by the coalition estimates that when all the planned or ongoing projects on the Upper West Side are finished -- such as Donald Trump's Riverside South and the Coliseum development -- an additional 50,000 cars and trucks will pass through the area from West 57th to West 72nd Streets each weekday.</p>
        <p>The United States attorney's office, which represents the Postal Service, would not comment on the lawsuit, said Marvin Smilon, a spokesman. But in its court papers, the Postal Service notes that the new station would be smaller than an older one that existed on that site, and that the 1992 study took into account future development.</p>
        <p>There is already a small retail post office at West 68th Street and Columbus Avenue. The expansion would occur behind that structure, in 45,000 square feet of space that the service owns.</p>
        <p>Brian T. Ketcham, executive director of Community Consulting Services, which carried out the coalition's traffic study, said whatever the ultimate decision about the post office was, ''The bottom line is that the Upper West Side needs to look at  the total impact of all these projects.''</p>
