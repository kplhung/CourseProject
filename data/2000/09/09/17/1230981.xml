        <p>The prospect of New York terrified me to the roots. I had no clear idea of what I wanted to do, just that I wanted to be successful and rich and move in the right circles and go to the Stork Club and El Morocco. It was one thing to have been the darling of my class at Williams (where I sang and danced in Stephen Sondheim's first musical), but quite another thing to earn a living for the first time in my life.</p>
        <p>I got a temp job for $35 a week at a theatrical publishing house doing odd jobs. Two weeks into the job, I was sent over to 30 Rockefeller Plaza to talk to an NBC executive named Pete Barnham, who had written a book about the new television industry. He was a huge man and such a nice guy. We got into a conversation about television, about which I knew nothing (my family didn't even have a set yet), and I became fascinated by his passion and vision. By the end of our conversation, he asked me if I wanted a job. I said sure. He made a phone call, and I walked out of his office with a job at NBC as a floor manager in live television for $75 a week, a fortune to me.</p>

        <p>I got a temp job for $35 a week at a theatrical publishing house doing odd jobs. Two weeks into the job, I was sent over to 30 Rockefeller Plaza to talk to an NBC executive named Pete Barnham, who had written a book about the new television industry. He was a huge man and such a nice guy. We got into a conversation about television, about which I knew nothing (my family didn't even have a set yet), and I became fascinated by his passion and vision. By the end of our conversation, he asked me if I wanted a job. I said sure. He made a phone call, and I walked out of his office with a job at NBC as a floor manager in live television for $75 a week, a fortune to me.</p>
        <p>I went on to floor-manage some of the legendary shows of the golden age of television, but everything I knew I learned at the ''Howdy Doody'' show, where I worked for a year and a half. It was a magical assignment. I became friends with Buffalo Bob and Clarabell the clown and Princess Summerfall Winterspring, and with two of the puppeteers, Rhoda Mann and Dayton Allen. (Dayton, up on the bridge where the kids couldn't see him, once sculptured an anatomically correct body part out of a dozen Three Musketeers bars -- one of our sponsors -- and hung it out of his fly while he was puppeteering and doing the voices of Phineas T. Bluster and Flub-a-Dub.)</p>
        <p>At my cue to start at exactly 5:30 p.m., Buffalo Bob would open the show each day by yelling out, ''Hey, kids, what time is it?'' And the kids in the Peanut Gallery, whom I was in charge of, would yell back, ''It's Howdy Doody time,'' and they'd all sing the opening song that every kid in America seemed to know. Some kids would cry, they were so excited to be there. This was the thrill of live television. It was a great time.</p>
