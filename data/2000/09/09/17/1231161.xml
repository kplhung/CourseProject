        <p>The train to the plane is about to leave the station.</p>
        <p>Testing may begin next month of the first passenger car on the first 3.3-mile leg of the AirTrain light-rail system between Kennedy International Airport and the subway station in Howard Beach, Queens. Meanwhile, construction is well under way -- as angry neighbors along the Van Wyck Expressway will attest -- on the three-mile leg to the Long Island Rail Road and subway stations in Jamaica, Queens.</p>
        <p>Don't pack your bags just yet. The system is not scheduled to open until late 2002. But after all the years of talk about a rail link to Kennedy, the concrete outlines are taking shape with remarkable speed.</p>
        <p>A 1.8-mile loop around the Kennedy terminals is about two-thirds complete, said Anthony G. Cracchiolo, director of priority capital programs for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is overseeing the project. About 70 percent of the columns needed for the elevated track, or guideway, along the Van Wyck have been erected. ''We should have that guideway completed and the highway restored by this time next year,'' Mr. Cracchiolo said.</p>
        <p>AirTrain is being developed and will be run by Skanska U.S.A. and Bombardier Transportation as the AirRail Transit Consortium, under contracts from the Port Authority worth $1.035 billion. Slattery Skanska Inc. is building the infrastructure. Bombardier is responsible for the passenger cars. Additional design and engineering are by STV Inc.</p>
        <p>The current contract does not include the $300 million AirTrain terminal in Jamaica, which has been designed by the Port Authority's architecture unit, under Robert I. Davidson. With the sweeping arc of its roof, it would echo the new Terminal 1 and International Air Terminal at the other end of the line.</p>
        <p>A lawsuit by Southeast Queens Concerned Neighbors and the Committee for Better Transit is pending in the federal Court of Appeals, arguing that the environmental impact statement omitted ''vital and controversial'' information about the effects of building an elevated railway on the neighborhood. ''While similar structures are being demolished elsewhere in the city, the Port Authority seeks to build a new el right in front of our homes,'' Ruby Ward, president of Concerned Neighbors, is quoted as saying in the brief.</p>
        <p>Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens noted the complaints of noise, dust and cracks in houses along the Van Wyck. But she said AirTrain will ultimately ''be a great boon to Jamaica,'' perhaps spurring industrial relocation there or even a hotel ''It's certainly not an el,'' she said. ''It looks better than I had anticipated and the speed with which the construction is happening is probably unique.''</p>
