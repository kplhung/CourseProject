        <p>The governor's race in North Carolina is one of the most contentious in the country, with gobs of out-of-state money starting to pour in as the national Republican Party tries to help former Mayor Richard Vinroot of Charlotte overcome a 10-point lead held by the Democratic front-runner, State Attorney General Mike Easley.</p>

        <p>The governor's race in North Carolina is one of the most contentious in the country, with gobs of out-of-state money starting to pour in as the national Republican Party tries to help former Mayor Richard Vinroot of Charlotte overcome a 10-point lead held by the Democratic front-runner, State Attorney General Mike Easley.</p>
        <p>The two men have had sharp exchanges. But the most recent took things to a new level. Of sorts.</p>
        <p>In a speech last weekend, Mr. Vinroot kept referring to Mr. Easley as ''the little fellow.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Easley is 5 feet 10 1/2 inches tall, an inch or so taller than the average American man. Mr. Vinroot stands 6 feet 7 1/2 inches, good enough in earlier years for him to be a bench warmer on the basketball team at the University of North Carolina.</p>
        <p>The ''little fellow'' reference was not Mr. Vinroot's first in the campaign regarding height -- in other speeches, he said that ''North Carolina needs a full-grown governor'' -- but it was his most biting reference. And unlike the earlier reference, it did not go essentially unnoticed.</p>
        <p>First, some of Mr. Vinroot's supporters weighed in, among them Jack Hawke, a former North Carolina State Republican chairman. ''I'm not sure it was a good thing to do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Easley took his shot.</p>
        <p>''At least I act grown up,'' he said.</p>
