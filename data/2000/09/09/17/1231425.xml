        <p>The number of complaints about possibly contaminated bottled water rose steeply yesterday, and detectives and F.B.I. agents were investigating whether three people who said they had consumed tainted water had made false reports to the authorities, officials said.</p>
        <p>The number of reported incidents involving bottled water had climbed to 22 by evening, most of them in New York City and a few in Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland Counties, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>None of the new complaints involved serious injuries and no one was hospitalized, officials said. In many cases, Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik said, the water was consumed three to four weeks ago and the police do not have water samples or the bottles. In other cases, water was submitted for analysis. In two cases, the police determined that a baby and a woman had become nauseated from prescription medicines.</p>
        <p>Detectives from the Police Department's Major Case Squad and F.B.I. agents investigating the possibility that bottled water may have been tampered with have yet to uncover any link or pattern, or any evidence of foul play. But officials said they had not ruled out the possibility that someone intentionally contaminated the water.</p>
        <p>''In none of the cases is there a commonality,'' Commissioner Kerik said yesterday afternoon, speaking with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the health commissioner after the Steuben Day parade on the Upper East Side. ''To our knowledge right now, and according to the investigators, we feel that none of them are connected.''</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Giuliani announced the first three complaints of contaminated bottled water on Wednesday, a number of people have come forward with similar accounts. Yesterday, Mr. Kerik said the police believe three false reports were filed.</p>
        <p>One of the incidents, reported on Thursday, involved an employee at a Getty gas station at 1915 Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx who was taken to Jacobi Medical Center after drinking from a bottle of Aquafina water, one of the brands involved in the earlier incidents, the police said. The man, Jose Pena, spoke of a burning sensation in his mouth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pena, 28, told the police he had bought the water from a vending machine in the gas station and walked over to a nearby florist shop to drink it. An employee of the florist shop telephoned 911 when Mr. Pena started to gag. He was taken to Jacobi, where he was treated and released and where hospital officials told investigators that he had suffered no apparent injuries, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Health Department tests found that the water in the bottle contained chlorine bleach, and one senior investigator said doctors told detectives that Mr. Pena had bleach on his hands and clothes and would have been sickened had he drunk any of the water that he had turned over to the authorities.</p>
        <p>Several officials familiar with interviews of Mr. Pena said that he could be charged with filing a false report (a misdemeanor under state law), or that if he lied during an interview conducted by an F.B.I. agent, he could be charged with lying to a federal officer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pena could not be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Although the three incidents occurred on Aug. 3, Aug. 27 and Sept. 6, the mayor said he did not learn of them until Sept. 12. On that day, he said, Police Commissioner Kerik learned of an investigation into the reports and called him ''within five minutes.'' The next day, Mr. Giuliani held a news conference on the matter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said he would have preferred being informed more quickly about the contamination incidents, noting that the city could then have notified the public sooner. ''I'm a compulsive overnotifier,'' he said. ''We will try to tighten things up so that in the future we don't have that happen.''</p>
        <p>Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen said he was reasonably satisfied with his agency's handling of the matter.</p>
