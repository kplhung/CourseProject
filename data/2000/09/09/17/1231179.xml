        <p>By month's end, a court order will force the state Department of Corrections to remove 111 high-risk sex offenders from a temporary lock-up in Kearney. The problem is, the state is still looking for a place to put them.</p>
        <p>Since the Legislature passed a law two years ago that allowed the courts to hold dangerous offenders beyond their terms, the state has been scrambling for a place to keep them -- and being met with the kind of reception usually reserved for a toxic waste dump or a trash-burning incinerator.</p>
        <p>Last week in Maurice River Township, a small town on the marshy shore of the Delaware Bay, residents jammed the municipal building to oppose a plan to hold the offenders in in a new facility near Bayside State Prison. ''I am very concerned about this filth coming down here,'' said Al Hooper, who lives in Maurice River, to a volley of applause from his neighbors. ''It is a smear. We don't need it.''</p>
        <p>So far, every town that has been proposed as the site for the Special Treatment Unit has either sued, protested or both.</p>
        <p>Woodbridge, which was originally picked as the best location, has tied the plan up in court for nearly a year. Hudson County sued after the Department of Corrections temporarily placed the offenders in the former Hudson County Jail in Kearney, and a state judge has ordered the department to remove the men by Sept. 29.</p>
        <p>State officials thought they had solved the problem earlier this month, when the town committee in Maurice River appeared to welcome the new unit in return for annual payments of $800,000. The state planned to put the offenders in a new building inside the razor-wire fences of Bayside State Prison.</p>
        <p>But after freeholders from Cumberland County -- already home to four prisons --  condemned the plan, the town committee reversed itself and told the state to look elsewhere. After a special meeting in the town hall last week in Leesburg, Freeholder Louis Magazzu vowed a legal ''dogfight'' to stop the Department of Corrections. ''We will take this as far as necessary,'' Mr. Magazzu said.</p>
        <p>Late last week, Governor Whitman's office said that the state had run out of time. Her spokesman, Peter McDonough, said the governor would decide in the next 10 days where to house the inmates. Mr. McDonough said that unless another community came forward with a better site, which was unlikely, the governor would choose between Woodbridge and Maurice River --  with or without local consent.</p>
        <p>''We have two communities that are equally opposed to it, and there is no way to measure whether one is more opposed than the other,'' he said. ''We have a law, and we have to live up to it.''</p>
        <p>In the short run, the offenders will most likely be sent to East Jersey State Prison in Woodbridge. State officials first chose Woodbridge because experts trained to deal with sex offenders were already at the prison. But the town responded with a lawsuit claiming the state had violated its own rules in picking the Woodbridge site.</p>
        <p>Richard L. Rudin, the lawyer representing the town, said the state had refused to turn over crucial documents that Woodbridge needed in order to file its objections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rudin said the town cited ''serious environmental problems'' that could be caused by the project, and also raised questions about security at East Jersey State. He said the town wanted the corrections department to turn over its master plan for all the state's prisons, but that so far state officials had refused.</p>
        <p>The state judge handling the case has appointed a special master to review the request and has forbidden the state to move forward until the issue is resolved.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mayor McGreevey condemned the state's handling of the situation last week, particularly the temporary transfer, as ''an abysmal failure of the administration to deal in good faith with the people of Woodbridge.''</p>
        <p>But it is the governor's office that feels  whipsawed; after reaching an agreement with Maurice River, it has to start over. And while Mr. McDonough said the governor wanted the cooperation of the municipalities, he said that she had to consider the wider interests of the state. ''Mr. McGreevey is thinking like a mayor, and the governor has to think like a governor,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Building public projects has never been easy in New Jersey, the most densely populated state. John Weingart, a former assistant commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Protection who headed the state effort to store low-level radioactive waste in the late 1990's, said local governments often accepted projects, only to back down after public outcries.</p>
        <p>''As soon as people learned about the possibility of a waste disposal facility, they felt they should have been alerted earlier,'' Mr. Weingart said. ''That led to the reaction that the process must be rigged.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, opposition killed plans for the dump. After 12 townships rejected state overtures, New Jersey made a deal this year with South Carolina to take the waste.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weingart could easily have been talking about the state's failed bargain with Maurice River, a sparsely populated town that houses two state prisons, Bayside and South Jersey.</p>
        <p>Once a center of the country's oyster fishery, Maurice River never recovered from a blight that decimated the Delaware Bay oysters in the late 1950's. Marinas and boat slips cluster along the river, and boarded-up shucking houses dot the two-lane roads that embrace the weedy shore. Nearly half of the people who live here are inmates, and the Department of Corrections is the biggest employer in Cumberland County.</p>
        <p>Town officials were concerned about about imposing yet another property tax increase this year, when the state offered hefty annual payments as part of a deal to build the sex offender unit within the grounds of Bayside State Prison. The $800,000 offer would be in addition to the $300,000 the town received for the two prisons, and Mayor Ronald D. Riggins Sr. said it would have eliminated the need for a tax increase.</p>
        <p>Initial reaction to the plan was muted. Mr. Riggins, who is also a sergeant at Southern State Prison, said a small crowd attended the town's public hearing last month, and Town Hall only received two phone calls. But when freeholders read about plan, two of them held back-to-back news conferences demanding that it be reconsidered. By last Monday's meeting, town residents turned out to protest the plan, raising questions about security.</p>
        <p>Freeholder Director Douglas H. Fisher, who has been one of the plan's most outspoken critics, said the state had bullied the town into accepting the new facility and taken advantage of its economic difficulties.</p>
        <p>''It is disgusting, any time they have a problem and they are not sure where to put something, they turn to Cumberland County,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''We feel we have done our fair share and we do not need to accept these violent sexual predators.''</p>
