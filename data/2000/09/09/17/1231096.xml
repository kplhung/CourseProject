        <p>IT'S not often you'll hear someone compare herself to a maggot and mean it as a boast. But that's just how Carol Royal describes the role she and two associates are trying to fill with the Trenton Materials Exchange, a shoestring operation that seeks to keep us from drowning in our own abundance.</p>
        <p>For more than a year, Ms. Royal has been rescuing chairs, desks, computers and other corporate castoffs that still have life left in them, diverting them from the trash pile to nonprofit organizations, small businesses and individuals.</p>
        <p>''I liken our operation to scavengers, maggots, because that's what we are,'' she said. ''We feed off waste.''</p>
        <p>There's plenty of waste in New Jersey, of course; lots of stuff being thrown out, replaced with the new and improved, especially in these prosperous times. Ms. Royal hates to see usable things discarded. She knows that disposing of trash is never easy.</p>
        <p>A few years ago Ms. Royal was in the front lines of the successful fight against an incinerator in Mercer County. Her reward? An acquaintance at the Environmental Protection Agency suggested that she apply for a grant to start a materials exchange, an environmentally friendly alternative to incineration that has worked elsewhere.</p>
        <p>So with a $40,000 grant she began trying to put a simple idea into effect: find businesses that were discarding usable equipment and reroute it to people who could use it. It was harder than it seemed. For one thing, her hopes of doing it online quickly evaporated.</p>
        <p>''People need to touch and feel things,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Bob Pierce came to the rescue, giving her  use of an empty five-story warehouse on New York Avenue in Trenton where he once ran a transport business. Now two floors of it are full of metal desks, filing cabinets, room dividers, computers and so on. There's an elegant round conference table, and office chairs of all sorts.</p>
        <p>Ira Lackey came by one day looking for chairs and was captured -- he is now the volunteer director of operations for the exchange. Geri La Placa heard about Ms. Royal and was intrigued; a physical therapist, she had long been struck by how much medical equipment gets tossed prematurely. She joined the cause last spring, and now the exchange has a medical section -- dozens of walkers, crutches and more, barely used.</p>
        <p>The exchange, a nonprofit organization, makes all of it available for a modest handling fee, to community groups, small businesses, individuals. A swiveling office chair, which may cost hundreds of dollars new, can be had for about $25. Counterintuitively, perhaps, finding takers has been the hard part.</p>
        <p>''I have no trouble getting donations,'' Ms. Royal said. ''It's much harder to get rid of things.''</p>
        <p>Also hard, she said, is self-discipline. She is constantly coming across usable things that don't fit her office/medical parameters -- 1,000 pairs of yellow coveralls, for instance. At one office site, she realized gorgeous plantings were going to be thrown out; she got hold of a program that taught youths about landscaping and another that maintained children's gardens.</p>
        <p>Mainly, though, she tries to keep the stated focus; she doesn't want old clothes, broken lawnmowers or pets (a waste exchange in another state was once given a boa constrictor). She wants to develop a component that will reclaim material from buildings that are being demolished. She wants to buy Mr. Pierce's warehouse off Route 1 and make it the focal point of an economic revitalization with a reuse-and-recycle theme. And she wants to get people rethinking the throwaway life style.</p>
        <p>''The broader mission is to educate,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this is all eco-nonsense. Ms. Royal says her operation has kept about 250,000 pounds of stuff out of the waste stream this year, but that's nothing in the grand scheme of things, and need we bother? Aren't the trash alarmists first cousins to the energy-scare types who predicted decades ago that the world would be out of oil by 1990?</p>
        <p>Maybe, but here's another view: Ms. Royal and friends are helping to keep alive the art of the pack rat, who saves miscellany because it might be useful someday. It's a skill that doesn't get much respect these days, as a drive through the state's $500,000 neighborhoods will tell you -- lawns are spotless, garages pristine; nothing is squirreled away because it's easier to buy new.</p>
        <p>That sort of view was taking hold in the Roaring Twenties, too. Then came the Depression and wartime rationing. We still need pack rats among us. Who knows what's ahead?</p>
