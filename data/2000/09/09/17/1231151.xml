        <p>WHATEVER defines the new season, it is Moliere who frames it. And however the new plays and musicals or the revisited ones fare, the state's professional theater calendar begins and ends with the forever stylish 17th-century playwright.</p>
        <p>Even though comic genius is the stock label attached to Moliere, deep perception of human nature is his rightful claim to immortality. It must not be forgotten that he wrote ''The Misanthrope.''</p>
        <p>Yes, he dealt with hypocrisy, hypochondria and all human folly as farce, but that's just surface. And no, ''The Imaginary Invalid,'' ''Tartuffe,'' ''School for Scandal'' or any other Moliere standards are not the opening and closing events of the season.</p>
        <p>Expect a new play by Moliere as the Long Wharf Theater's opener on Wednesday. ''L'Etourdi,'' a little-known, early work (1655), has been unearthed, and the master of Moliere in verse translation, Richard Wilbur, is calling it ''The Bungler.''</p>
        <p>This is not only a season's opening but also an American premiere for the play and for this version of what the theater's artistic director, Doug Hughes, calls Moliere's ''lost first masterpiece.'' It is an event indeed in which the estimable Jeff Weiss is Mascarille, the valet, the role first played by the playwright.</p>
        <p>A new play about Moliere is to end the season next year (May 24 through June 23) at Hartford Stage. The title is ''Moliere'' and the author is William Luce, who wrote of Emily Dickinson (''The Belle of Amherst'') and of John Barrymore (''Barrymore''), creating one-person plays for the greats, Julie Harris and Christopher Plummer. This, too, is to be a one-man show.</p>
        <p>Non-Moliere classics will abound, at Hartford Stage especially.</p>
        <p>''Macbeth,'' its season opener, is the first Shakespearean work to be staged by the artistic director, Michael Wilson. Sophocles follows, in Adrienne Kennedy's update of ''Oedipus the King,'' then Ibsen in another contemporary spin, this one by Theresa Rebeck, whose own plays are regularly seen in the state.</p>
        <p>This season, Ms. Rebeck's ''Loose Knit'' is to be included in the Studio Work series of Connecticut Repertory in Storrs, in the intimate space that will also produce an absurdist classic, Ionesco's ''Exit the King,'' with ''Twelfth Night'' taking the main stage in the season's first slot.</p>
        <p>Real old-time classics at Yale Repertory are to include Congreve (''The Way of the World'') under the artistic director Stan Wojewodski Jr.) and a Yale School of Drama adaptation of ''The Birds'' by Aristophanes.</p>
        <p>Even wholly contemporary plays are touched by the classical, as in the Long Wharf main stage production of Charles L. Mee's ''Big Love,'' yet another new spin on Aeschylus, who never could have dreamed that he would be the inventor of sexual politics.</p>
        <p>Long Wharf's Stage II, indelibly reopened in 1997 with ''Wit,'' is to honor its commitment to new works -- ''Modern Orthodox,'' by Daniel Goldfarb, and ''The Mandrake Root,'' with Lynn Redgrave as author and star. But it will also give a second viewing to deserving plays, like ''The Model Apartment,'' not one of the heralded works by New Haven's current playwright of choice, this year's Pulitzer Prize-winning Donald Margulies. After Doug Hughes's production in April, you may ask, why not?</p>
        <p>While ''The Model Apartment'' had a brief, non-commercial run Off Broadway, some worthy plays travel the regional theater circuit, never getting to be known, sometimes in a perpetual state of revision. William Mastrosimones's ''Tamer of Horses'' has been in a league of its own for about 15 years; this season, Stamford Theater Works is giving the explosive three-character play a shot.</p>
        <p>Theatergoers starved for musicals who see no reason to go to Broadway when Broadway can come to Connecticut do not miss out if they bide their time.</p>
        <p>The big tours come round: The Shubert in New Haven will have ''Swing!'' and, in anticipation of summer, the ''Kiss Me, Kate'' revival in June.</p>
        <p>''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' -- don't ask which version -- dashes to the Bushnell in Hartford, without its original star, Douglas Sills, having played the Shubert last season with Mr. Sills.</p>
        <p>If its ''Godspell'' you crave -- don't ask which version -- go to Oakdale, to Stamford Center for the Arts or to the Garde Arts Center in New London.</p>
        <p>But better yet, get a schedule of musicals at the Bushnell (eight; ''Fosse'' ends today), Oakdale (six), the Garde (six, plus Off Broadway's hit, ''I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change''), the Shubert (five including Off Broadway's never-ending ''Stomp'') and Stamford Center (four including the ''Chicago'' revival, still on Broadway.)</p>
        <p>For the real musical theater buff of old, the true nostalgist, bells are ringing. That is, ''Bells Are Ringing,'' the beloved Styne-Comden-Green musical of 1956 is revving up for a long overdue Broadway rerun, and it is not at Goodspeed, which had it in 1990. With Faith Prince landing the great Judy Holliday role, ''Bells'' will ring at the Palace Theater in Stamford in February.</p>
        <p>And ''Golden Boy,'' Charles Strouse musical style, revised for the umpeenth time since the 1964 Broadway production that starred Sammy Davis, with a book by Clifford Odets and William Gibson, will have another go, with a batch of new Strouse songs and a new book by Keith Glover, who is also to direct what is being called a reinvention, at Long Wharf in November.</p>
        <p>At Goodspeed's Norma Terris stage in Chester, ''Dear World,'' Jerry Herman's unsuccessful try at making a musical of ''The Madwoman of Chaillot,'' is to be revamped, while the main stage in East Haddam revives a real oldie: Cole Porter's ''Red, Hot and Blue.''</p>
        <p>What comes closest to cutting edge will pop up at the Stamford Center for the Arts, with ''Another American: Asking and Telling,'' Marc Wolf's one-man meditation on gays in the military and Savion Glover's newest variation on his terrific tap-mania pieces, this one called ''Savion! Foot Notes,'' which pays homage to ''three tap legends,'' one of whom is all of 10 years old.</p>
        <p>The ''Vagina Monologues'' (cast unknown), ''The Worst of Eric Bogosian'' and Sandra Bernhard's being or doing Sandra Bernhard are all to pass through Stamford. News releases describe both iconoclastic performers as ''ranting and raving.''</p>
        <p>And Mump and Smoot in ''Something Else with Zug,'' now at Yale Repertory, takes the art of clowning to a dimension of terror, or at least angst, and in a language all its own, called Ummonian.</p>
        <p>Since the essential we-saw-it-first status of Conecticut theatergoers must be preserved, it is important to mention that the Shubert, once again, will attempt to reclaim its legend as tryout home for Broadway hits, with ''Tom Sawyer'' -- no, it is not ''Big River II'' -- and Barry Manilow's ''Copacabana'' (which is also to play the Bushnell).</p>
        <p>It is as crucial to talk of the Broadway and Off Broadway-bound shows that Connecticut saw first. Consider Mark Lamos's high-voltage staging of Edward Albee's mystifying ''Tiny Alice,'' starring Richard Thomas. It will have taken two years to travel from Hartford Stage to Second Stage in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>And the indefatigable Tovah Feldshuh, who has morphed into the indestructible Tallulah Bankhead, in one version after another, is taking Tallulah Off Broadway for the second time. The latest peek into the iconic theater star's wild life, with Ms. Feldshuh as one of three authors, had an acclaimed run at Hartford's Theater Works last season. It was then titled ''Tallulah Tonight.'' It is now ''Tallulah Hallelujah'' (but then it was once ''Southern Comfort'').</p>
        <p>Giving credit where its due, remember that Patti LuPone in ''Matters of the Heart,'' more a theater piece than a concert, reopened the new Garde in New London last year, and is scheduled to play twice a week at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center next month. And, last season, Savion Glover had a luxurious tryout at the Garde where his newest show rehearsed and had its first performance.</p>
        <p>Then there's ''Cobb,'' Lee Blessings's play about the three stages of a baseball icon: Yale Rep 1989, Stamford Theater Works 1992, Off Broadway this year.</p>
        <p>And ''Part Two of the Geography Trilogy'' (a fusion of theater and Asian, African and Western dance) offered last season at Yale Rep, will play next month at the Next Wave festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Talk about cutting edge.</p>
        <p>Actually, it may have been Moliere who inspired that phrase. For Alceste, the misanthrope of all time, ranted and raved about everybody and everything.</p>
