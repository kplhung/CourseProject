        <p>Name: Denis Nash  Age: 32  Coming from: Atlanta  Looking for: A virus</p>
        <p>Denis Nash has never been to Queens in his whole life. And yet here he is, as green as the lawns of Flushing, sitting in a New York City health department van parked in front of a small brick house in the northern part of the borough. The house is empty because the woman who lives in it is lying in a hospital bed with her brain so enlarged that it threatens to kill her. And the people in the back of the van -- a professional exterminator, an animal-disease expert, a bug expert from the American Museum of Natural History -- are all looking to Nash to tell them how to figure out what made this woman, and a lot of other people nearby, very sick.</p>
        <p>Nash, a 31-year-old epidemiologist, was not really supposed to be calling these shots. ''I'd never done anything like this before in my life,'' he explained later. ''And I'm thinking, well, all right. Let me just wait and see if someone else here is going to know what to do.''</p>
        <p>But nobody did. The silence in the van was deafening. So Nash said the first thing that seemed logical in the situation.</p>
        <p>''I was like, 'All right . . . I guess we should get out.'''</p>
        <p>This was the summer of 1999, and just a few months earlier, Nash had been in grad school at the University of Maryland. But he made up his mind to come to New York because for people who hunt diseases, it is the best place in America to hunt. Seen through the prism of epidemiology, the city is less a melting pot than a petri dish, a place where continents' worth of exotic microbes stroll casually through customs at Kennedy Airport every morning.</p>
        <p>When he arrived in New York, Nash knew nothing about a house mosquito called Culex pipiens. He had never seen a case of encephalitis close up or watched anyone die from it. He had never heard of a pathogen called the West Nile virus, which made its strange maiden voyage to the Western Hemisphere last summer, killing seven people around New York, severely sickening 55 others and becoming the first mosquito-borne viral outbreak in the city since yellow fever.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, Nash seemed well suited to being the guy who got the outbreak dumped into his lap. He has an easy confidence about him, a kind of let's-solve-this-problem earnestness. For most of his childhood, he was reared by a single mother in a working-class town outside of Philadelphia, where, in high school, his biggest ambition was to keep his job at the local pizza parlor, maybe own it one day. But at Drexel University he discovered that he had a knack for science. From there he went to Johns Hopkins to study public health and then to Maryland for his doctorate.</p>
        <p>Nash studied to be a chronic disease specialist; most of what he knew about the outbreak part of the job he learned just before moving to the city, during a three-week crash course at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. There he had been accepted into an elite federal medical corps -- the Epidemic Intelligence Service, a kind of F.B.I. for epidemiologists.</p>
        <p>Nash came to the city last July on a two-year loan from the C.D.C. and was supposed to help out with AIDS and H.I.V. His plan, as he recalls it now with some humor, was simply to ''dabble in a little outbreak stuff,'' get some experience on the infectious side to round himself out. So he sat in on regular Tuesday-morning outbreak meetings in an Orwellian, pale-blue office near City Hall called the Bureau of Communicable Diseases. He even pitched in on a minor eruption of Salmonella Montevideo. ''It was a tiny little outbreak,'' he says, ''but I thought it was the coolest thing -- that I was actually working on this.''</p>
        <p>Then on Monday, Aug. 23, 1999, city health officials got a call -- now known around the bureau as the Call -- from Flushing Hospital in Queens about a couple of elderly patients who appeared to have encephalitis, a dangerous inflammation of the brain. The disease is usually caused by viruses or occasionally by chemical exposure and can be caught several different ways -- through insect bites or contact with infected materials or by eating or drinking contaminated food. Over the next few days, similar cases filtered in, and by the following Saturday eight encephalitis cases had been confirmed.</p>
        <p>Normally, Nash would have played a lesser part in this drama. But as it happened, the infectious disease officer on loan from Atlanta, a man named Farzad Mostashari, was away on vacation that week. Which is how Denis Nash -- who had not even retrieved his stuff from storage, much less moved into his Brooklyn apartment -- became, by default, the United States government's point man for one of the strangest public health emergencies New York has ever experienced. And which is how he found himself that hot Wednesday afternoon last Sept. 1 climbing out of a health department van, trying very hard to remember that he did, after all, have a doctorate in this field.</p>
        <p>He also tried to remember an old adage doctors have about diagnosing diseases, one that applies equally well to this kind of medical sleuthing: When you hear hoofbeats, don't think zebras. The message, usually intended for overambitious interns, is not to waste time hunting for extraordinary causes until you have figured out whether the obvious, boring ones are the answer. In this case, that meant noticing, as Nash did, that one 80-year-old encephalitis victim liked to collect rainwater in five-gallon buckets to water the vegetables in his garden. Interviewing the man's wife and son, Nash also found out that the man suffered from insomnia and would get up very early in the morning to smoke in his backyard, near the water-filled buckets.</p>
        <p>As Nash was leaving the man's house, his cell phone rang. It was a doctor who had interviewed the family of another victim who lived nearby and was calling to describe the surroundings at that house. The doctor also mentioned in passing that the victim had some plastic buckets around -- for collecting rainwater. ''At that point,'' Nash says, ''I had this overwhelming gut reaction. I was really shaken by it.''</p>
        <p>It also set into motion the deductive reasoning process that is at the heart of epidemiology. Standing water means mosquito larvae. Mosquitoes carry viruses than can cause encephalitis. New York officials, including Nash, had become convinced that mosquitoes were the culprit, but it took time for research in federal labs to fully narrow the tests of blood and spinal fluid to search for those viruses. By Sept. 3, tests proved the suspicions right, and the city began a massive campaign of spraying. A few weeks later, the virus was officially confirmed as West Nile.</p>
        <p>In the months that followed, Nash and his supervisors at the health department did not do the kind of sleuthing that looks sexy on television. They did not wear lab coats and examine dead crows; they did not peer into microscopes. Instead, they wrestled the bureaucracy of public health: dispatching armies of doctors to look at patients' charts, interviewing families and poring over disease manuals.</p>
        <p>Epidemiologists have come to rely increasingly on computers over the years, but Nash and his colleagues more or less kept track of the outbreak in the same stunningly simple way that John Snow, a father of epidemiology, tracked the source of a London cholera epidemic to a single contaminated water pump in 1854: by plotting the cases on a street map. In Nash's case, it was a ragged Hagstrom five-borough, taped to a beaten-up bulletin board and riddled with colored thumbtacks.</p>
        <p>It was also part of Nash's job, the part he liked the least, to haul this map across the street to City Hall and into the office of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who needed to know what to tell the city. ''I'm not a big fan of the mayor,'' he admits, with the frankness that only a federal employee can afford. ''But I was a bit star struck, I must say. And he did grasp all of this stuff really quickly. I mean, we showed him a chart, and he caught a math error we made.''</p>
        <p>As dangerous outbreaks go, West Nile turned out to be a bit anticlimactic. It is certainly not a rampant killer like AIDS, smallpox or even influenza. It does not have the terror factor of, say, Ebola. And to many New Yorkers now, the spraying itself seems more dangerous. But to the public health professionals who contended with it last summer and continue to do so now, it was the most significant outbreak most would encounter in their careers. They had no idea how it got here; more important, they had no idea how many people were infected and how lethal the strain of virus was.</p>
        <p>Nash, now 32, is back to spending most of his time where he started, on AIDS and H.I.V., and writing a federal report about the outbreak. He is also planning to get lent out again, this time for a short stint in rural Nigeria, where he will leave behind mosquitoes and focus on Guinea worms, which are ingested through drinking water, often grow up to three feet long and sometimes emerge from the body through painful blisters.</p>
        <p>West Nile was, as Nash puts it, a ''mind-boggling'' experience for a brand-new epidemiologist. He is sure, though, that Africa will put it all into a humbling new perspective. ''On the list of public health emergencies threatening Africa,'' he says, ''West Nile is barely even on the radar screen.''</p>
