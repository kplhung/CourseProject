        <p>I was afraid to leave New York City for at least a year after moving here. I didn't even like to sleep, I was so madly in love with the place. I barely knew anyone and at first would do nothing but walk, miles up and down and across the city, obeying the commands to walk and not walk, letting the lights direct the route.</p>
        <p>I fell in love on Orchard Street, and we existed on an exotic diet: egg creams and Krispy Kremes, huge tubs of the world's best potato salad and overstuffed Italian sandwiches from Parisi's; bialies and pirogies and blintzes. We'd get high and go on long luxurious excursions to Rite Aid and the cut-price supermarket far east on Grand. There was a Chinese aisle and a kosher aisle, and most of the rest was Latino. The whole thing looked to me like living Pop Art -- the shiny bright red and yellow of El Pico and Cafe Bustelo bordering towers of goods by Goya, tins of guava and hearts of palm with gaudy, faded print labels. Vast slabs of welfare cheese. Pregnant children on the checkout and beautiful boys actually packaging your things for you.</p>

        <p>New York: fairy-tale island of food and art supplies. Yonah Schimmel's and Ratner's and Katz's, Sammy's Roumanian and Schapiro's House of Kosher Wines. . . . Central Art Supply, Cheap Paint, Utrecht and Pearl Paint. Opulent palaces with 20 brands of oil paint instead of 2. A special section just for white! And all those empires of fantastic hardware. I lost hours wandering Canal Street admiring the staggering arrays of industrial frippery, potential artware -- sheets of colored Perspex and Mylar and glittering plastics and laminates, defying a painter not to throw out the canvas and take up scatter art or ready-mades.</p>
        <p>In fact, it was tempting to stop making art altogether and spend the rest of my life roaming the streets of the city, just to see if I could see it all.</p>
