        <p>Re ''Priests of the 60's Fear Loss of Their Legacy'' (front page, Sept. 10):</p>
        <p>As a seminarian, I know it is a myth that my peers neglect the Second Vatican Council's attention to social justice. We place great value on faithfulness to church teachings, but this heightens rather than diminishes our concern for the poor.</p>
        <p>However, many people promulgate an image of seminarians as narrow-minded, self-righteous elitists. They may confuse our theological orthodoxy with a desire to return to pre-Vatican II days. Others complain that we ''don't care about the poor'' to express their frustration that we have not accepted an ideology that sacrifices fidelity to the Gospel for ''relevance'' and popular approval.</p>
        <p>Last summer, I worked in the South Bronx with the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal, whose service to the poor and fidelity to church teaching are well known. A look at their work would have exposed the stereotype of seminarians.</p>
