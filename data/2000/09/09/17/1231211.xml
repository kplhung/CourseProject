      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Quick, think of a song about New Jersey - no, not one by that Springsteen character. Not so easy is it? Imagine, then, coming up with three hours of songs about the state. Thats what John Weingart is doing, and he will broadcast them on WPRB, Princetons campus radio station, tonight starting at 7. On his ironically named ''Music You Cant Hear on the Radio'' show, which started its 27th free-form, mainly folkish season last Sunday night, Mr. Weingart (who is associate director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers) will present''Songs of New Jersey.'' Selections will include Dave Van Ronk's''Garden State Stomp,'' whose entire lyrics are the names of Jersey towns; ''Jersey Bound'' by Mike Sinatra (no relation, we think); and ''The Long Branch of the Red Bank Bank which was written by Dick Levine of Middletown, who was Mr. Weingarts mothers dentist. The stations signal, at 103.3 FM carries about 40 miles from Princeton and can be heard any-where at WPRB.com.</p>
