        <p>My father was the first; he arrived in Nueva York at the start of the 70's, in the Years of the Puerto Rican Obituary. He had the ''usual'' Caribbean immigrant experience: he worked lousy jobs, his hands bled almost constantly (the stigmata of the factory), he slept in unheated buildings and he starved himself thin. All around him buildings exploded into fire. Fortunately he wasn't in them, but it didn't help his sleep any knowing that a family of seven had been roasted to death the week before one block over. The stench of the smoke, of those destroyed lives, seeped into his dreams.</p>
        <p>Who is surprised that after five unhappy years in Nueva York my father decided that he'd had enough? Right before the rest of our family immigrated, my old man abandoned New York City, where he had friends, where he had a life, and relocated to New Jersey, where he knew no one. (We didn't hear about this move until after we'd arrived.) We settled in a Section 8 apartment complex that was bounded on one side by Old Bridge (where Vitamin C is from) and on the other by Sayreville (Bon Jovi land). This is where I lived when I reached the States, where I spent my American childhood, marooned in the middle of suburbs white as a gringo's behind.</p>

        <p>New York went from the Oz I dreamed about in the Dominican Republic to the distant sight of the Verrazano Bridge. Transformed from the City of Everything to the city we visited on weekends. A future that had been promised but never arrived.</p>
        <p>Many years later I would move to Nueva York, at 26 gaining the life I always thought should have been mine. It was no longer the Years of the Puerto Rican Obituary; by then, it was the Years of the Gentrifying Nightstick. I had the ''usual'' Caribbean college-graduate experience. I worked temp jobs, I lived in an unwinterized apartment in Brooklyn, I smoked cheap hydro and was too broke for anything but activism. Nothing burned, thank God, not even the bread. Often I would find myself in Washington Heights, the capital of the Dominican diaspora, imagining what could have been. I was wanting to be a writer, so I was studying my parents' life and trying to remember my own.</p>
        <p>Certain nights, when I was restless and nothing was working out, I'd take the D train over the Manhattan Bridge. As the train left the tunnel and began to cross the East River, I'd step between the cars, steadying myself with my hands. This, for some reason, made me happy. It wasn't really dangerous, and the view that it afforded was beyond words. A city ablaze, suspended between black sky and river.</p>
        <p>Our first night in the States my old man wanted us to see this city, so he drove us through it on our way home from J.F.K. There it is, he said. There it is. I remember our silence, the cold of the windows against our faces. It looked to me like science fiction. Like an incubator for stars, where suns are made. This was before we realized that we were actually bound for New Jersey, when we thought one of those lights was going to be our home.</p>
