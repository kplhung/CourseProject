        <p>Amid speculation that quarterback Ryan McCann might not finish what he started today against Michigan, U.C.L.A. Coach Bob Toledo approached McCann before kickoff with a rare mandate.</p>
        <p>''This is your game to win,'' Toledo told McCann. ''Don't look behind your back. This team is yours until the game is over.''</p>
        <p>One week after being benched at halftime against Fresno State, McCann engineered another dramatic U.C.L.A. victory over the nation's No. 3-ranked team -- this one by 23-20. Just as Alabama did on Sept. 2, the Michigan Wolverines trudged away from the Rose Bowl with national championship hopes in serious jeopardy and learned that the Bruins are a force on the field and underrated in the polls.</p>
        <p>The No. 14-ranked Bruins mirrored McCann's performance before a crowd of 88,044. They shook off early struggles, rallied to take the lead in the fourth quarter and won after anxiously watching the Wolverines miss two chances to tie it and at least force an overtime.</p>
        <p>With 3 minutes 27 seconds left, Michigan's Hayden Epstein missed a 24-yard field goal attempt. Two minutes later, with Michigan in field goal range, John Navarre, the Wolverines' redshirt freshman quarterback, was intercepted by safety Jason Stephens at U.C.L.A.'s 15-yard line.</p>
        <p>The Wolverines would not have been in such a desperate position if not for McCann, who finished 21 of 40 passing for 236 yards and 2 touchdowns. The left-handed sophomore was 15 of 21 for 151 yards in the second half and led the Bruins on scoring drives of 80, 80 and 85 yards, wearing down the Wolverines as much as the 110-degree heat inside the Rose Bowl.</p>
        <p>''I think we're the No. 1 team in the nation,'' said McCann, the star of the 35-24 victory over Alabama two weeks ago. ''I don't know who else we can beat and what else we can do. But that's up to the voters.''</p>
        <p>The Bruins (3-0) certainly should crack the top 10 when the college football polls are released Sunday, but will probably not gain enough ground to jump over Michigan (2-1).</p>
        <p>''This one was for our program,'' Toledo said. ''If we're going to be one of the elite teams in the nation, we had to make a statement today. And we made a statement.''</p>
        <p>Toledo, who has not hesitated benching Bruin quarterbacks since Cade McNown graduated to the National Football League two years ago, said of McCann: ''He started slow, but I had confidence in him. I challenged him and had the utmost faith that he could perform.''</p>
        <p>Michigan led, 20-17, through three quarters, but each time the Wolverines tried to pull away, U.C.L.A. struck back. The Bruins opened the second half with a 14-play, 80-yard drive that ended in DeShaun Foster's 5-yard run, which cut Michigan's lead to 13-10.</p>
        <p>The Wolverines responded by going 57 yards in five plays, extending their lead to 20-10 on Chris Perry's 9-yard run. Navarre had put Michigan in scoring position by hooking up with David Terrell for a 37-yard completion to U.C.L.A.'s 20.</p>
        <p>The Bruins retaliated, marching 80 yards in 10 plays to pull to 20-17 on McCann's 20-yard touchdown pass to Brian Poli-Dixon.</p>
        <p>McCann continued his stellar play into the fourth quarter, when the Bruins finally wrested the lead from Michigan with 6:30 to play on his 2-yard pass to the backup fullback Ed Ieremia-Stansbury. The extra-point snap was botched, leaving the Wolverines behind by a field goal, at 23-20.</p>
        <p>Navarre, starting his third game while Drew Henson recovers from a broken foot, was 8 of 28 for 111 yards, one touchdown and an interception. Anthony Thomas ran for 182 yards on 24 carries for Michigan.</p>
        <p>Foster helped balance the Bruins' offense with 95 yards rushing on 24 carries.</p>
        <p>''They did things we thought they would do,'' Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said. ''They ran a balanced attack and stayed out of third-and-long situations. In the second half, they came out and changed the momentum. We answered, but they kept coming back.''</p>
        <p>Michigan was nearly flawless while building an early lead. The plan was to protect Navarre with safe play-calling, a strategy that had helped him lead the nation in pass efficiency through two games. He did not make any costly mistakes, completing 7 of 18 attempts for 74 yards and a touchdown, a perfect 29-yard pass between two defenders to Terrell for a 13-3 lead early in the second quarter.</p>
