        <p>Name: Eddie Klaynberg  Age: 17  Born in N.Y.C.: 1983, Brooklyn  Neighborhood: Upper East Side Who he is: High school student</p>
        <p>Then: ''I board at LaSalle Academy out on Long Island during the week. I'm taking chemistry, math, American history and English. I've always been into film, so maybe I'll do N.Y.U.'s film program. My dad's a contractor, and he wants me to do a double major in engineering and business. He also doesn't want me to misbehave on the weekends and come in at dawn. Usually I come home and party at places like Cheetah, Sound Factory, Speed and Twilo even though I'm not supposed to. It's O.K.; I know my way around -- I look 18 or 19. I'm in my experimentation phase. You only live once.''</p>

        <p>Name: Eddie Klaynberg  Age: 17  Born in N.Y.C.: 1983, Brooklyn  Neighborhood: Upper East Side Who he is: High school student</p>
        <p>Then: ''I board at LaSalle Academy out on Long Island during the week. I'm taking chemistry, math, American history and English. I've always been into film, so maybe I'll do N.Y.U.'s film program. My dad's a contractor, and he wants me to do a double major in engineering and business.

It's O.K.; I know my way around -- I look 18 or 19. I'm in my experimentation phase. You only live once.''</p>
        <p>Now: ''I kind of slacked off when I was a soph, so I studied this year and got pretty good grades. My father said he'd get me a car if I did well, but I think I'll hold off and make it a graduation present. I've been working hard at a floor-finishings store this summer. I'm not experimenting much anymore but I'm still going to clubs. I follow the D.J.'s around. It's fun coming out of a club and it's daylight outside. I thought about college in Miami, for the clubs, but now I've got my eye on an apartment, so I'll probably move sometime next year. I'm going to be as independent as I can, but there's always my parents to back me up if anything happens.''</p>
        <p>Name: Marja Plisic  Age: 52  Arrived in N.Y.C.: 1974, from Krk, Croatia  Neighborhood: Flushing  Who she is: Hotel maid</p>
        <p>Then: ''Usually you have to have someone recommend you, but I just found this job at the St. Regis Hotel through the newspaper. I was flying. The people are really nice. They all like it when they go into a clean room. I empty the garbage, I change the beds, clean the bathroom, give fresh towels, dust, vacuum. The worst is when the kids come in and they put the stickers everywhere. This year I went two times for a whole week to a hotel the St. Regis has in Washington to train the maids. It was a good experience to work in another hotel, but there's nothing there.''  Now: ''I'm working on the 15th floor. Same old story, Sundays and Mondays off. I just came back from vacation. I still have my mother, my brother, my sister and nieces and nephew in Croatia. It's poor -- they live day by day. It's getting better over there, but it's going to take time. I'm going to have grandchildren now, at the end of the year. My son and my daughter both. It was a nice year. We're living here and we have a piece of bread. No place like this in the world. I'm going to be happy for another year.''</p>
        <p>Name: Gloria Lieberbaum  Age: 68  Born in N.Y.C.: 1932  Neighborhood: Upper East Side  Who she is: Grandmother</p>
        <p>Then: ''My husband died of cancer six months ago. We were married for more than 40 years. A few days after the funeral, I began feeling pains in my chest. I had an eight-hour surgery for a new heart valve in June, and a carotid-artery operation two weeks ago. I'm doing better. I went to my doctor today and he said, 'You've got another 30 years.' I said: 'I don't want to be around that long. Give me 20.' I'm going to make it because I've made it through everything else. I keep busy by shopping -- Saks, Bergdorf's, Barneys -- having lunch with my friends and getting out to my place in Bridgehampton. I'm going down to Florida next week for the first time since my husband died. I'm frightened. My life is here.''  Now: ''I'm looking better than I was last October. Somebody up there likes me. In Florida, I took golf lessons and started every morning with an aqua-aerobics class. It gets rid of all my nerves. So I'm up and around again. I see my grandchildren -- my whole life is my family. It's tough but I'm managing. I'm still lonely; my husband was my first love. I've made some new single friends, though, which is nice. If you go out with married friends, it's a little funny. They say, 'You haven't got a man yet?' And I laugh and say, 'I'm not looking.' ''</p>
        <p>Name: Tiernach Cassidy  Age: 28  Born in N.Y.C.: 1972, Queens  Neighborhood: Woodside  Who he is: Firefighter</p>
        <p>Then: ''Today I'm a 'johnny,' which is one step up from a 'probie,' a new guy. I'm at Engine Company 3 in Chelsea. Every time I ride around the old neighborhood in my rig, I let them know I made it. The day I got on the job and came home with all my bunker gear, I said, 'I'm a fireman now!' And my girlfriend, Jennifer, all she said was, 'Just be careful.' ''  Now: ''Last fall I was rotated to Hook and Ladder 161 in Coney Island. On June 10 I had my biggest fire yet -- a five-alarm on Brighton Beach Boulevard and Ocean Parkway. It was the first time I was actually inside the fire. It was surreal. Every hole I poked into a wall, flames came out. It didn't even look like fire. It looked like water rolling. It took us six hours to get it out, and it basically totaled all the stores there. That night, Jennifer got home and asked, 'How was your day?' I said, 'I woke up in the hospital.' I'd passed out from smoke inhalation and heat exhaustion. That never happened before. But when I saw everyone in the company was there with me, I didn't feel so bad. I'm engaged now, and I'm doing the footwork for a ring.''</p>
        <p>Name: Frank Aquilino, known as Butch the Hat  Age: 54  Born in N.Y.C.: 1946, Manhattan  Neighborhood: Little Italy  Who he is: Actor</p>
        <p>Then: ''When I was a longshoreman, we'd do things down at the piers to amuse ourselves. We'd curse each other. We'd put on shows to pass the time. When the jobs moved to Jersey, I said, 'Where can you get a job where you don't have to work?' So I went to Stella Adler and got my SAG card. I've been in 'Bullets Over Broadway,' 'A Brooklyn State of Mind' and 'Analyze This.' Usually I'm in the background. I prefer not to speak. In 'Smoke,' Harvey Keitel is telling his story to William Hurt, and I just sit there smoking a cigarette and nodding my head. And my expressions tell the whole scene. Alan Arkin said I was a scene stealer. I said, 'That's my job.' As a kid I was very susceptible to colds, so I wore a hat. And when I took it off, it didn't feel right. I wear the brim up because I want to show the contours of my face. I've got several hats -- 50 or 60.''  Now: ''In 'Wonderland' I was a psychiatric case who spent his time painting. I also showed up in 'Murder on Mott Street.' In this last year I've gotten a lot of exposure, thanks to cable. People have come to know Butch the Hat. When I'm not working, I take walks. There are still some funny people down on Mulberry Street. They'll come down without a penny and talk themselves into a meal. I like to talk to them and make them happy. I tell a lot of the girls how good they look. I shake hands with vendors and tell them: 'Don't worry about Giuliani. We're not going anywhere.' ''</p>
        <p>Name: Mohamed Amen  Age: 28  Arrived in N.Y.C.: 1996, from Ismailia, Egypt  Neighborhood: Murray Hill  Who he is: Building attendant</p>
        <p>Then: ''I'm temporarily the doorman at 20 Park Avenue. In Egypt, I was a lawyer, doing both criminal and commercial law. The American Bar of Law Examiners just approved me to practice here, but first I have to take a 20-credit course for a master's degree. I'm going to pay around $36,000 for it. Too much money. I came to New York to be with my father. The first thing that made me open my mouth -- wow -- was the gay people, how they act. No offense, but I never saw this in my life. I'm engaged. Her name is Rabab; she's still in Egypt. She's a veterinarian. I miss her a lot. I hope they lower the rates for AT&amp;T -- I speak with her every day.''  Now: ''I'm still a doorman, but I also do sales part time for my cousin's chemical company. And I've sold men's wear. Two months ago, I started working at the front desk at the golf academy at Chelsea Piers. I work seven days and two nights a week. I'm probably the most freaky guy you'll see -- you're gonna find me everywhere. In May, I started a paralegal course at the New York Career Institute. I'll see Rabab in October or November. I hoped she would be here by now to make my life easier and sweeter, but we have e-mail. It's not normal for me to be alone. I joined a gym, and the women are coming on to me. But I don't want to do something for pleasure and then feel bad for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Name: Thomas Magrath  Age: 22  Born in N.Y.C.: 1978  Neighborhood: Boerum Hill  Who he is: Homeless</p>
        <p>Then: ''I'm staying at the Salvation Army's Bond Street Drop-In Center in Brooklyn. For a while I was a Navy petty officer stationed at Puget Sound, but I didn't get along with the guys in my division. They all thought I was a little queer because I kept to myself. I stayed to myself to keep out of trouble. In 1997 I got a general discharge -- I got into a fight with an officer. I made it back to New York and stayed for a while with my sister in Queens, but when she got pregnant, she and her husband moved. If my mother knew where I was now -- oh, boy. I get meals at the Church of the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen in Manhattan. I hand out flyers and deliver groceries. I've saved about $300. I want to take some electronics courses, but it's tough. I lost my wallet and ID in Central Park and I can't get new ones. Nobody wants to help. I'm getting the runaround from the city. I know that I'm not going to be in this situation forever. I know that for a fact. I've got faith, or I wouldn't be alive today.''  Now: Tom's Bond Street caseworker has not seen him since last fall.</p>
        <p>Name: Ebony Haith  Age: 22  Born in N.Y.C.: 1978, Manhattan  Neighborhood: Staten Island  Who she is: Aspiring model</p>
        <p>Then: ''I'm behind the counter at Banana Republic on Prince Street. What I really want is to be a model. I'm looking for a photographer. I've been on MTV and I've already modeled for Moshood, an African designer. By 2000, I should at least be on the cover of Essence. My long-term goal is to be a social worker. I want to help make it easier for children, because it hasn't been easy for my siblings and me. I was in foster homes, and my aunt adopted me when I was 4. My mother is an alcoholic and manic-depressive. I haven't seen her since I was 17.''  Now: ''I live on Staten Island because the rent is great and I want to be with my girlfriend, Caren -- she stole me from the city. Three weeks ago I started part time at Shiseido. We do massages, makeovers, and sell skin-care products. I'm going to the John Lewis Beauty School. My grandmother has a beauty salon but she's retired, and I know that in a couple of years, if I have my beauty license, she'll give it to me. The cover of Essence will be next year. All the modeling agencies tell me the same thing -- 'You're gorgeous, but you're not exactly what we're looking for.' I got in touch with my mother. She's at a rehab center in Harlem, but I haven't seen her. Her counselor says it's not a good time yet. I didn't need anything from her, but I wanted to be in a position where if I needed to help her, I could. She's my mother -- if it weren't for her, I wouldn't be here.''</p>
        <p>Name: Christina Soto  Age: 19  Born in N.Y.C.: 1981  Neighborhood: Greenwich Village  Who she is: Cashier</p>
        <p>Then: ''I'm into the whole rave scene. I love jungle music. My boyfriend Ari's a D.J. But it's getting corrupt with money and drugs. Living in the Village, I've seen what's happened to some of my friends, and it's made me a little wiser. I graduated from Seward Park High School, and I want to go to SUNY-Purchase and teach. Children are so beautiful. Once I was a T.A. for special-ed kindergarten students. The kids were actually listening to me, and they weren't listening to their regular teacher. The boys had crushes on me. I dreaded going home.''  Now: ''Ari and I broke up. It was too much stress. I felt I was taking care of him too much, emotionally. We decided to call it off before we began to despise each other. He's still a D.J., and I'm working as a cashier. Right now I have to make some money. I didn't get good enough grades for scholarships. I'd like to take some music engineering classes and be my stepfather's assistant -- he's a musician. I'm seeing a lot of guys, but I'm waiting for someone to sweep me off my feet.''</p>
        <p>Name: Patrick Acevedo  Age: 37  Born in N.Y.C.: 1963, Bronx  Neighborhood: South Bronx  Who he is: Letter carrier</p>
        <p>Then: ''I work from 6 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and I take care of exactly 1,239 mailboxes. That's over a hundred buildings. It's the worst route in the station, but I'm only three years on the job, so I'm the junior man. What helps me now is my prior military experience -- I was in the Marines for 17 years. I have the stamina.''  Now: ''I moved to North Carolina in late July. My kids love it here; they can just open the sliding door and go out and play. In the city, you have to have parental supervision all the time. It's a better life for them. The job is very different -- you're in a Jeep, toss the mail into the box and you're off. On my old route, I averaged 30 to 40 feet of mail per day; down here, one of the hardest routes has only 13 feet. I'll still come up to New York to see my sister and cousins and to shop, but some things I won't miss. The day before I left, my car was stolen.''</p>
        <p>Name: William Wingate  Age: 73  Born in N.Y.C.: 1927, Brooklyn  Neighborhood: Murray Hill  Who he is: Lawyer</p>
        <p>Then: ''My biggest priority now is raising money to find a cure for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva -- F.O.P. It's a horrific disease that only about 2,500 people in the world have. One is my grandson Daniel. He's 5. What happens is that the muscles turn to bone. It's like a skeleton growing in your body. Daniel can still walk, but he can't throw a ball. If he trips, he can't raise his hands to stop his face being smashed on the ground. Eventually he won't be able to turn his head or even scratch his nose. I've been supporting my daughter and son-in-law emotionally, and now I want to do something more concrete. My life has been very fortunate. Fifty years ago I graduated as valedictorian of my Brooklyn Law class, and I still love what I'm doing. My specialty is medical malpractice and personal injury. I still walk the 10 blocks to my beautiful office in the Graybar Building. I'm of counsel now so I usually work three days a week. I've found that most of my colleagues who retire regret it bitterly.''  Now: ''We had a magnificent New Year's Eve party for 20 crazy friends at our place in Ocean Beach on Fire Island, where I'm a village trustee. We solicited them for F.O.P. contributions. On Feb. 2, there was a major fund-raiser for about 150 people at the Waldorf. It was called 'Songs for Sophia.' That's the name of an F.O.P. daughter of Connie Green, a chorus member at the Metropolitan Opera, who got acquainted with my daughter. She got Placido Domingo and several other stars to sing for us. There have been some hopeful developments in F.O.P. research. But even if we don't find a cure, anything we can do to get the word out is good.''</p>
