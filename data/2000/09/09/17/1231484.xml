        <p>Is this something straight from flex-your-pecs Wrestlemania, or what?</p>
        <p>In Minnesota, Gov. Jesse Ventura, that old pro grappler, and Senator Paul Wellstone, once himself a pretty good college wrestler, are having at each other in a war of political words that, if they keep at it, will be worthy of a stamp of approval from the World Wrestling Federation.</p>
        <p>Move over, Triple H, Chyna and The Rock. Both of these guys want to be top gopher. And so come election 2002, the trash-talking stops and they're going to get it on.</p>
        <p>Or so they've indicated. The governor, a middle-of-the road political independent, will be up for a second term that year, and the senator, one of the most liberal Democrats in Washington, says he's more inclined to run for governor than go after a third term on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>''Well,'' the governor told CNBC, ''if the senator wants to get it on, I'm here and waiting.''</p>
        <p>''Bring him on.''</p>
        <p>What is really driving the senator, the governor went on, is revenge. The senator's son, David, he recalled, worked for one of the also-rans in the 1998 governor's race and, he contended, ''I probably cost the senator's son a job at the capitol.''</p>
        <p>Here's the Wellstone riposte:</p>
        <p>''Jesse Ventura made a career out of provoking and intimidating his opponents. Unfortunately, as governor he hasn't been able to leave those tactics behind. One more reason not to take him seriously.''</p>
        <p>Not a smash-mouth Smackdown. But don't change that channel.</p>
