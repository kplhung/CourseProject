        <p>Flying in the face  of the current one-for-the-price-of-two retail boom, Nike is introducing the Nike Ovidian, a reversible cross-training sneaker that offers two looks for the price of one.</p>
        <p>Named (in a rather unusual literary stretch) for the ancient poet Ovid, who wrote ''Metamorphoses,'' the unisex sport shoe, $85, has an inner ''booty'' that can be removed from the outer shoe casing. The outer shoe can then be turned inside out, changing it from a leather and suede exterior with a waffle traction sole, to a canvas mesh exterior with a zigzag sole.</p>

        <p>Flying in the face  of the current one-for-the-price-of-two retail boom, Nike is introducing the Nike Ovidian, a reversible cross-training sneaker that offers two looks for the price of one.</p>
        <p>Named (in a rather unusual literary stretch) for the ancient poet Ovid, who wrote ''Metamorphoses,'' the unisex sport shoe, $85, has an inner ''booty'' that can be removed from the outer shoe casing. The outer shoe can then be turned inside out, changing it from a leather and suede exterior with a waffle traction sole, to a canvas mesh exterior with a zigzag sole.</p>
        <p>To be sure, this is not a lightning-quick operation: in a trial run, each shoe required about five minutes for the unlacing, inversion wrestling, replacement of booties and relacing (not including time lost when the left booty was mistakenly stuffed in the right outer shoe).</p>
        <p>And while both of the shoe's looks have a certain George Jetson space age simplicity, the handsomest element of all is the booty, which with its graphite and black mesh upper on a bright orange rubber sole looks as if it walked straight off the shelves of Prada Sport. A third look free.</p>
