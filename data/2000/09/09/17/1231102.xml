        <p>IN 1983, Jozsef Domeny bought a one-way ticket from communist Hungary to capitalist West Germany. The long road that he followed has led him, 17 years later, to Floral Park and a successful career as a builder.</p>
        <p>At the time, Hungary allowed its citizens to buy only round-trip tickets, banning one-way trips to discourage defections. Mr. Domeny, who prefers to be called Joe, hoped that the authorities would not notice that he was never coming back, but he was promptly summoned by the Budapest police, ''and I thought, 'That's it, it's all over,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>But the police only wanted to question him about payments he had received as an extra on television and in the movies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Domeny's trip, from Budapest to Munich, was fraught with fear and anxiety. Mr. Domeny, a 24-year-old subway motorman who was divorced, agonized over leaving his 4-year-old son, Gabor, and his year-old daughter, Brigitte, and he was terrified that the border guards would check his papers and return him to Hungary, where he faced certain imprisonment.</p>
        <p>''I was praying I wouldn't get caught,'' Mr. Domeny said in an interview, and praying did not come easily to a man whose family members had been forbidden to practice their Catholicism when they moved to Budapest 15 years earlier.</p>
        <p>In West Germany, Mr. Domeny was granted refugee status, and he stayed for 11 months, ''but they wouldn't let me get a work permit for two years,'' he said. Relying on the four years of German he had studied in school, he found work nevertheless, installing blinds and awnings on houses.</p>
        <p>When he learned that the International Rescue Committee would help him leave Germany for South Africa, Australia, Canada or the United States, he said, the choice was easy: ''Two were too far, one was too north, and I always used to hear in Hungary that America was the place of dreams where you could work hard and buy a house.''</p>
        <p>In 1984, the German government paid his air fare to New York, and the rescue committee paid three weeks' rent in a run-down hotel on 35th Street and Fifth Avenue and gave him a small amount of cash. With only $65 in his pocket and a bag of clothing, and unable to speak a word of English, ''I was in bad shape, but I was free,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I didn't get on a subway for three days because I was scared of the homeless people,'' he said, but he was put in touch with a Hungarian bookstore on 82nd Street and Second Avenue. To save money, he walked the 50 blocks there every day, discovering a thriving Hungarian community that introduced him to a Sunday soccer league and a church, where he found his first work in construction.</p>
        <p>''It was great to work,'' Mr. Domeny said, ''but when my three weeks was up at the hotel, the I.R.C. gave me $100 and cab fare to Flushing. That's where I found the only room I could afford.''</p>
        <p>Alas, his boss went back to Hungary and his job was short-lived. But Mr. Domeny found work in a carwash.</p>
        <p>''It was 7 days a week, 12 hours a day, for $3.50 plus tips,'' he said. But after a couple of weeks, his fierce work ethic paid off: he was offered the opportunity to become a foreman, a job that he held for two years and that ultimately allowed him to buy a used car.</p>
        <p>''It was the first car I ever owned,'' he said, a broad smile betraying the pride he still feels about the purchase, a 1973 Buick Regal. That allowed him to travel to Bay Shore to supervise the owner's other carwash.</p>
        <p>Then the carwash closed, and Mr. Domeny found work as an apprentice to a window installer. His boss, once again, was impressed by Mr. Domeny's hard work and offered him the chance to work by himself. But again, the job fell through, this time when Home Depot arrived on Long Island, driving many small home repair companies out of the market.</p>
        <p>''At that time,'' explained Mr. Domeny, now 41, ''I was married again, and it was during the gulf war. Gas prices were high and jobs were short. My wife was working as a teacher and I was staying home with our new baby, Eric, but I didn't like that. I decided to put ads in the Yellow Pages to start my own construction business.''</p>
        <p>The business started to take off but the marriage fizzled.</p>
        <p>''It was a tough time for him,'' said his new wife, Dr. Lori Reeve Domeny, 35; they were married last year. ''For a Central European man, it wasn't easy reversing traditional roles.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Domeny, who was also previously married, teaches psychology at Queens College and is a psychotherapist at a number of geriatric centers.</p>
        <p>She said that when Mr. Domeny's marriage broke up, he became depressed. ''But then one day he woke up and decided to get in shape'' with rowing exercises at the Y.M.C.A. in Bellerose, where she teaches aerobics.</p>
        <p>''That was it,'' she said of her instant attraction to Mr. Domeny.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Domeny, who describes himself as shy, said it took him several weeks to ask her out. Finally he approached her, saying, ''You have to come out for pizza with me because last night I drove my van into my garage door just thinking about you.</p>
        <p>''The dent is still there,'' he added.</p>
        <p>At first, Mr. Domeny's solo business venture. ''I only made enough to get by,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His first customer, a Great Neck resident who asked him to install an air-conditioner, was pleased with the work and hired Mr. Domeny to replace his roof and paint the inside and outside of his house.</p>
        <p>''I just about broke even on that job,'' he said, ''but from there it was word of mouth to people in Forest Hills, Whitestone and all over Long Island. What I learned is that owning your own business is a lot of struggling, but it's a good way to be independent. It's better than working for someone else.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Domeny, who has permanent-resident status and plans to become a citizen soon, is the owner of Precision Master Inc. and says he has no need to advertise. He prefers to hire workers from Europe ''because they care a lot about the work and how it comes out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Domeny, whose parents are retired bus drivers in Hungary, has never been back, but he has stayed in touch with them and with his children, once meeting his son Gabor in Austria ''because Hungary was still communist at the time,'' he said. Gabor, now 21, is visiting from Hungary to learn the construction business from his father.</p>
        <p>Mr. Domeny said he applied the same principles to business that he did to learning English.</p>
        <p>''I never took a course in English but I listened to the way people were speaking the language and I copied them,'' he said. ''The same thing with building. No one ever explained to me what to do, but I watched what they were doing and I learned.''</p>
        <p>The Domenys are still pursuing their goals: to buy a home and have a family.</p>
        <p>''But today the 'American dream' is not what I heard about in Hungary,'' he said. ''That was when the husband works and the wife stays home and takes care of the kids. Today, we both have to work like crazy. The dream has changed.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Domeny expressed the couple's ambivalence: ''We can't decide if we should save for a house, or travel and eat out. We've loved our trips -- to the Bahamas, Mexico, Florida, Aruba and Hawaii.''</p>
        <p>What advice does Mr. Domeny have for other immigrants who come to this country nearly penniless, unable to speak English and unsure of the future?</p>
        <p>''Learn English and work hard,'' he said. ''Find a job and keep it and work your way up. You have all the opportunities, if you're an American, to make something of yourself.''</p>
        <p>A Diverse Island</p>
        <p>This series looks beyond the stereotypes that sometimes taint relations between immigrants and native Long Islanders, examining immigrants' lives and how they are being woven -- or not -- into the social and economic fabric. Previous articles described the aspirations of Muslims on the Island, a Korean nail salon owner and her American-raised son, a Colombian landscaping entrepreneur, an Indian liquor store owner and a Trinidadian woman who manages a convenience store.</p>
