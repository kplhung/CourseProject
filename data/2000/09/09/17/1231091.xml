        <p>To the Editor: Crime cast a dark shadow on my family's vacation in Italy. One morning in bustling Pisa,  we were accosted by a group of gypsies: women with babies in body slings, teenagers and a mature woman who feigned scolding the gang. Their touching became pushing and turned into a shoving match. My husband's wallet, in the zippered interior compartment of a zippered body pouch, was stolen. This once-busy piazza became a ghost town.</p>
        <p>Wandering the streets, crying ''Polizia'' to the few people we stumbled across, produced an eerie silence. People acted as though we didn't exist. Eventually we were directed to the police station.</p>

        <p>The majority of our vacation was wonderful because of professionally guided tours, but we will never return.</p>
