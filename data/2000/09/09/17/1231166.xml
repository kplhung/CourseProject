        <p>Just when you thought it was safe to cross roads like Route 10 on a Saturday afternoon, the retail chain Best Buy is about to give you pause.</p>
        <p>The Best Buy Company, one of the nation's largest consumer electronics chains, will be opening five new stores in the northern and central part of the state this fall.</p>
        <p>This will mark the first entry into the New York metropolitan region by the chain, which plans to open 40 stores in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut over the next three years.</p>
        <p>The company, which had $12.4 billion in sales for the fiscal year ending in February 2000, already has 393 stores in 40 states, including 4 in the South Jersey.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the chain, based in Eden Prairie, Minn., a suburb of Minneapolis, is entering the North Jersey market even though some home electronics and appliance chains -- Brick Church, Tops, Trader Horn and Newmark &amp; Lewis -- have gone under in recent years, while others have struggled but managed to stay alive.</p>
        <p>The Wiz filed for bankruptcy in 1997, but was saved by Cablevision, which bought its stores. Circuit City, a national chain based in Richmond, Va., which was also late in coming to New Jersey -- opening a score of stores three years ago -- announced in July that faltering earnings and increased competition had forced it to stop selling appliances and focus instead on electronics and home office products.</p>
        <p>But in the volatile retail business in New Jersey, where commercial real estate is scarce and expensive, newcomers continue to set up shop because the market is one of the richest in the country and the thinking is that their way of doing business will guarantee success, said James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.</p>
        <p>''By any measure we're an overstored state, but we've always been overstored,'' Mr. Hughes said. He noted that by 1990 the regional mall grid was complete, with 29 enclosed super regional malls encompassing about 30 million square feet.</p>
        <p>As a result, an aggressive retail industry came up with a new format, what he calls the ''big boxing of New Jersey,'' the erection of huge warehouse-like structures individually or in clusters.</p>
        <p>Despite having an abundance of stores, Mr. Hughes added, ''what we see now is that newer and more efficient competitors always arise.''</p>
        <p>''If they had to depend on growth alone they wouldn't make it,'' he said. ''But they feel, 'Our plans are more efficient, and we're going to take business away from the existing players.' ''</p>
        <p>Best Buy, which sells home office equipment, home appliances and entertainment software as well as consumer electronics products, is opening big box stores -- 45,000 square feet each -- on Paterson Plank in Secaucus, Route 22 Union, Route 46 in West Paterson and Route 1 in Woodbridge with the one in Route 10 in East Hanover to open soon afterward.</p>
        <p>The company, which has 60,000 employees nationwide, has hired 2,200 full- and part-time employees for the new stores, said Connie Stelter, a spokeswoman for the company.</p>
        <p>Best Buy has been planning the move into northern and central New Jersey for years, Ms. Shelter said, in part because of its success in Deptford, Mays Landing, Mount Laurel and Princeton in the Greater Philadelphia metropolitan market.</p>
        <p>''Best Buy is on a very aggressive growth pattern,'' she said. ''We've been growing into new markets as opportunities presented themselves.''</p>
        <p>She said it took a while for the company to enter the market in the New York metropolitan area because ''we wanted to make sure we could acquire prime store sites that could accommodate our 45,000-square-foot store with ample parking for our customers.''</p>
        <p>The Woodbridge store, for example, was built on the site of a former Rickel Home Center chain, and the Secaucus and Union stores on sites that once housed Tops.</p>
        <p>''Once they've done the easy stuff, they realize they can't afford not to be in north and central New Jersey,'' Mr. Hughes said.</p>
        <p>He noted that if the 12 counties that comprise North and Central Jersey were considered a metropolitan area, it would be the fifth largest in the country with the highest per capita income.</p>
        <p>''It's just the logic of it that brings companies to New Jersey,'' he said. ''New Jersey has the second highest per capita income, the bulk being in the northern central part. Only Connecticut is higher. So overall, it's probably one of the most lucrative markets in the country.''</p>
