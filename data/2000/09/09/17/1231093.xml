        <p>LAST May, a Federal Appeals Court in Manhattan rendered a decision that could save some co-ops and condominiums hundreds of thousands of dollars, real estate experts say. The decision -- based on a 1980 federal law enacted to protect shareholders and unit owners from sponsors who give themselves lucrative, long-term leases on building amenities at the time of conversion -- has expanded a co-op's or condominium's ability to end such leases without the consent of the sponsor.</p>
        <p>''What this means is that after 20 years, the Condominium and Cooperative Conversion Protection and Abuse Relief Act is still alive and well,'' said Walter D.

        <p>LAST May, a Federal Appeals Court in Manhattan rendered a decision that could save some co-ops and condominiums hundreds of thousands of dollars, real estate experts say. The decision -- based on a 1980 federal law enacted to protect shareholders and unit owners from sponsors who give themselves lucrative, long-term leases on building amenities at the time of conversion -- has expanded a co-op's or condominium's ability to end such leases without the consent of the sponsor.</p>
        <p>''What this means is that after 20 years, the Condominium and Cooperative Conversion Protection and Abuse Relief Act is still alive and well,'' said Walter D. Goldsmith, a Manhattan co-op lawyer who has brought several lawsuits under the act. ''And there are still plenty of buildings around that can benefit from it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldsmith said that although the act was passed by Congress 20 years ago, there had been relatively few cases litigated under its provisions. However, he said, co-ops and condominiums that stand to benefit from the law -- typically, those with garage or laundry-room spaces that are tied up in long-term leases with the original sponsor or his successor -- stand to benefit significantly.</p>
        <p>''If a lease can be recaptured from a sponsor, that would result in a substantial financial benefit to the building,'' Mr. Goldsmith said, explaining that many garage and laundry room leases negotiated at the time of the conversion had terms extremely favorable to the sponsor. ''These leases often go on for 50 or even 100 years. You could be talking about millions of dollars.''</p>
        <p>Scott E. Mollen, a Manhattan lawyer who wrote about the issue in the New York Law Journal earlier this month, said that the Condominium and Cooperative Conversion  Protection and Abuse Relief Act was enacted by Congress in response to concerns that elderly residents who were buying co-ops and condominiums in retirement communities were being taken advantage of by sponsors.</p>
        <p>''A number of years ago, when conversions were the hottest thing around, it became fairly common for sponsors to be very aggressive in carving out what they thought would be lucrative, long-term economic opportunities,'' Mr. Mollen said. ''In a nutshell, they were giving themselves sweetheart leases on commercial retail space and parking facilities in the building at a time when they were still in control of the board.''</p>
        <p>The abuse relief act enabled co-op corporations and condominium associations to end such leases unilaterally by filing an action against sponsors who had negotiated long-term leases for amenities that were deemed to be ''property serving the shareholders or unit owners,'' Mr. Mollen said, typically, garages and laundry rooms.</p>
        <p>One catch in the law, Mr. Mollen added, was that the notice of termination of the lease must be brought within a specific f time.</p>
        <p>''There is a two-year window within which the lease must be terminated,'' he said, explaining that the two-year time period began either when the sponsor relinquished control over the affairs of the building or when the sponsor's ownership of units in the building dropped to 25 percent or less,  whichever occurred first.</p>
        <p>Since most conversions in New York took place in the late 1970's and early 1980's, Mr. Mollen said, and since state law required a sponsor to relinquish control of a co-op or condominium's board of directors no more than five years after the conversion, co-op and condominium boards could reasonably believe that the two-year window had closed many years ago -- that is, two years after the sponsor relinquished control of the board.</p>
        <p>In the case recently decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and brought by a co-op at 136 East 56th Street, the court ruled that a sponsor could still be deemed to be in control of the building for purposes of triggering the two-year window under the act even after relinquishing apparent control of the board.</p>
        <p>''The court found that even after the election of an independent board in 1988, the sponsor retained veto powers that allowed it to exercise control over the building,'' Mr. Mollen said, referring to a provision in the co-op's governing documents that gave the sponsor the right to veto any change in the co-op's certificate of incorporation or bylaws as long as he owned even one share in the co-op.</p>
        <p>What that means, Mr. Mollen said, is that in buildings where a sponsor still owns more than 25 percent of the units -- and where the sponsor has a long-term lease for a laundry room or garage space -- there is a possibility that the two-year time period for ending the lease has not yet been triggered if the sponsor has retained some measure of control over the building.</p>
        <p>'' You have a number of older buildings where the relationship between the board members and the original sponsor has remained harmonious,'' he said. ''And in such situations, the board may fail to consider hiring independent counsel to determine whether they have any potential rights with respect to lucrative, long-term leases held by the sponsor.  In short, there are boards out there that have been lulled into sleeping on their rights.''</p>
        <p>Ted Poretz, the Manhattan lawyer who successfully represented the co-op at 136 East 56th Street, agreed.</p>
        <p>''Most co-op boards and managers don't even know this law exists,'' Mr. Poretz said. ''And those who do probably think that the window closed two years after the sponsor gave up control of the board.''</p>
        <p>In fact, he said, any co-op or condominium board that has a laundry room or parking garage tied up in a long-term lease with a sponsor -- or even a third party who bought such a lease from the sponsor -- should check their governing documents to determine whether the sponsor has retained control in the building.</p>
        <p>For example, he said, if a building's certificate of incorporation or bylaws contains a provision requiring a unanimous vote or even an 80 percent or 90 percent supermajority of votes to change the bylaws, certificate of incorporation or proprietary lease, it is possible that a sponsor who still owns more than 25 percent of units in the building could be deemed to still have control over the building for purposes of the act.</p>
        <p>''It's highly likely that there are provisions like these in many governing documents,'' Mr. Poretz said.  ''These are common bundles of protection that sponsors give themselves.''</p>
        <p>And if that is the case, he said, then the triggering of the two-year window for ending a sponsor's lease begins when the sponsor's ownership of units in the building drops to 25 percent. ''And there are lots of buildings out there that are only now approaching 75 percent of ownership by tenant-shareholders or unit owners,'' Mr. Poretz said, adding that once the two-year window was open, it was not even necessary for the co-op or condominium to prove that a long-term lease was unconscionable or unfair.</p>
        <p>''All you have to prove is that the sponsor essentially negotiated the terms of the lease with himself,'' Mr. Poretz said. ''And since the sponsor is in control of the building at the time of the conversion, that's something that's usually easy to prove.''</p>
