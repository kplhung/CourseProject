        <p>IT was at the Loucks Games at White Plains High School last spring. Gene Fulton, now 81, a track and field official for 45 years and before that a high school sprinter in the Bronx in the early 1930's, looked across the field. An earnest young man, not much older than the teenage athletes he was talking to, was gesturing.</p>
        <p>''It's not often,'' Mr. Fulton said with a smile, pointing to the young coach, ''that you have three generations active in the same sport at the same time.''</p>

        <p>IT was at the Loucks Games at White Plains High School last spring. Gene Fulton, now 81, a track and field official for 45 years and before that a high school sprinter in the Bronx in the early 1930's, looked across the field. An earnest young man, not much older than the teenage athletes he was talking to, was gesturing.</p>
        <p>''It's not often,'' Mr. Fulton said with a smile, pointing to the young coach, ''that you have three generations active in the same sport at the same time.''</p>
        <p>That young coach was his grandson, Tim Fulton, then the assistant to his father, Dennis Fulton, at Harrison High School.</p>
        <p>Now Tim is a head coach, too. He is in his first year directing the boys' and girls' cross-country teams and indoor and outdoor track squads at Somers High. There will even be county competitions where Tim, just 24, is coaching the Somers athletes, Dennis, 51, is directing the Harrison competitors, and Gene is officiating. Again, three generations of Fultons on the same field.</p>
        <p>''It's something to look forward to,'' Tim said.</p>
        <p>Having his own team is something Tim Fulton had looked forward to. He officially coached a Somers squad for the first time Friday in the Sacred Heart Invitational relays at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''I've got a lot of rookies, and everyone gets to run a mile,'' Tim said last week. ''A fun introduction to the sport.''</p>
        <p>Tim's introduction to competition came when he was 8. ''It was the Mercer Mile in Bedford in 1984,'' he recalled. ''Came in first in 7 minutes 36 seconds.''</p>
        <p>The sport became a big part of his life. He was either running or attending meets where his father, a distance runner, was competing. ''I used to run the twilight meets, and in high school I was pretty good,'' Tim said. ''Not a champion, just another very good high school runner.''</p>
        <p>So was his sister, Ann, who has run the New York City Marathon. ''In high school, I'd be running in a meet, Ann would be running, Dad would be coaching and Grandpa would be officiating,'' Tim said.</p>
        <p>Father and son both enjoyed the solitude of training. ''We seldom ran together,'' Tim Fulton said. ''We both like training alone. No headphones, no nothing, just peace.</p>
        <p>''But when there was the typical teenage rebellion, track was something we could always talk about. There was always a race to discus, to get us past the teenage stuff. A love of track kept us together.''</p>
        <p>Now the new coach can see things from the other side.</p>
        <p>''I'm not much older than my kids,'' he said, ''so I can understand what they go through. I'd like to have an effect on these kids' lives. I struggled a little from 15 to 20. I think I can relate.</p>
        <p>''And the great thing about track is, If you work hard at it, you're going to run faster. You don't need to have any special talent, like for baseball and soccer. It's a good lesson.''</p>
        <p>He has already improved the cross-country turnout.</p>
        <p>''We've got the biggest team we've ever had,'' Tim Fulton said with enthusiasm. ''I've got 17 boys and about a dozen girls. One thing I wanted to concentrate on was getting kids out -- it didn't matter how good you were. In fact, I think I really like working with kids who are not standouts: seeing them reach their individual goals.''</p>
        <p>Toward that end, strictly unpaid, Tim organized the voluntary Somers Running Club in July. ''Anyone was welcome to come out -- my runners, other runners, former runners, those wishing to get in shape,'' Tim said. ''Cross-country meets are run in the fall, but they're won in the summer.''</p>
        <p>He meant by the amount of running preparation one puts in.</p>
        <p>There could be a lot of running and winning at Somers this fall.</p>
        <p>''My girls' team is very strong,'' Tim said. ''I'm pretty much expecting a league title.'' Somers competes at the 2-A level in the county and at C level in state competition.</p>
        <p>''A couple of the girls are outstanding. Jen DeLaHoz qualified for the states last year,'' he said of a slender 5-foot-6 junior. ''And she should be better. She had just moved up from Florida then and wasn't used to the hills we have here.</p>
        <p>The boys' team, Tim said, ''will be competitive, maybe second to Kennedy in our league. Our senior co-captains, Mark Jean and Terrence Cordner, worked hard all summer.''</p>
        <p>And watching Somers' progress will be a very proud grandfather. ''It's nice when people tell me what a fine grandson I've got,'' Gene Fulton said. ''But you know what's the best part?</p>
        <p>''It's at those hot, daylong meets in the spring. The heat will really be getting to me -- I am in my 80's -- and suddenly Timmy will be there with a cup of cold water.</p>
        <p>'' 'Would you like a drink, Grandpa?'  ''</p>
