        <p>I arrived in the city and, having failed to impress The New Yorker, Time, Newsweek or any of the eight New York newspapers with my journalism degree, I went to work for one of the last of the movie magazines, Modern Screen. The publication and its rival, Photoplay, were real fan magazines and extremely benign. We wrote over and over about the same young stars -- Elizabeth Taylor, Piper Laurie, Debbie Reynolds, Tab Hunter and Tony Curtis. According to Modern Screen they all lived blameless, perfect lives.</p>
        <p>I took on some extra jobs to help my finances, typing for Blue Cross in the evenings and working as a proofreader for Newsweek on the weekends. It was here in the old offices on 42nd Street that I began to feel like a real New Yorker. There were no computers then, so the proofreading experience was personal and unique. A ''pitcher'' (the reader) read aloud every word, comma, question mark and quote to a ''catcher'' (the checker). Then a dot went over every word to indicate it was O.K. There was an arcane language to proofing. We used ''com'' for comma, ''query'' for question mark, ''screamer'' for an exclamation point and ''stop'' for every period. Anyone listening to us would have thought we were dealing in Sanskrit.</p>

        <p>We proofers worked in almost total seclusion, away from the clacking typewriters and the big-deal editors and reporters. (Occasionally, we'd catch glimpses of them in the elevator.) Still, we were part of a real news operation, and we felt as if we were the vanguard of perfection, sitting up in our dark offices above Times Square, the last people to see the news before it went out to the world.</p>
