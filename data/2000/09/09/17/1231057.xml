        <p>ONCE, when an uptight advertising executive decided to settle down, he married a witch. Now, when an uptight lawyer weds, he marries a hippie.</p>
        <p>Once, a befuddled suburban man endured his meddling mother's advice every time he drove his 1928 Porter, because she had been reincarnated as the car. Today, a befuddled suburban man endures his meddling mother's advice every day because she lives across the street.</p>
        <p>Once, the most normal people on the block were a family of monsters. Now, they're merely a family with a brood of monstrous children.</p>
        <p>For a while, television was home to the surreal worlds of ''Bewitched,''  ''My Mother the Car'' and ''The Munsters.'' These days, we get the decidedly less fanciful trappings of ''Dharma and Greg,''  ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' and ''Malcolm in the Middle.'' With only a couple of exceptions -- ''Third Rock From the Sun'' and ''Sabrina the Teenage Witch'' -- prime-time humor literally seems to have lost its magic. And there appears to be nothing significantly spellbinding on the new fall schedule that might buck this trend.</p>
        <p>In their infancy, television comedies tended to be very simple and domesticated, with the likes of ''The Honeymooners'' and ''I Love Lucy.'' But by the mid-1960's, no concept was too high and no credibility gap too wide for sitcoms. Many of the shows were like jokes that get told in the fifth grade: charming in their dopey innocence. Some premises were extraterrestrial: a man copes with his space-alien uncle (''My Favorite Martian''). Others were merely supernatural: a nun's habit gives her more than just a spiritual lift (''The Flying Nun''). And there were some that seemed to have come from another universe altogether: a wacky bunch of Allied soldiers laugh their way through life in a Nazi prison camp (''Hogan's Heroes'').</p>
        <p>High concept had one simple goal: to get audiences laughing at the very idea of a show before they heard the first joke. Which sounds funnier, a program in which an astronaut's life is complicated when he finds a genie, or one in which six friends sit around a coffeehouse talking about themselves?</p>
        <p>''Audiences want something that isn't dull,'' said the veteran television director Alan Rafkin, whose credits include ''Bewitched'' and ''My Favorite Martian.''  ''And those shows couldn't be dull because their concepts wouldn't allow them to be dull.''</p>
        <p>Sure, the jokes weren't always sophisticated -- Endora accuses her son-in-law, Darrin, of being pigheaded, then turns his head into that of a pig -- but watching a family of possum-eating hillbillies get rich and become the toast of Beverly Hills is comforting in a way. There was no nuance, no pseudo-hipness, no cynicism. The situations may have been fantastic, but the gags were pleasantly old-fashioned.</p>
        <p>''It was the idiot sitcom era, dominated by those kind of shows,'' said the television producer Warren Littlefield, who served as entertainment president at NBC when low-concept shows like ''Seinfeld'' began flying high. ''We were not a society big on relevance at that point. There was a feeling that television was a place to get away from it all, and attempts at doing more relevant stuff failed quickly.''</p>
        <p>Then life got complicated. Assassinations, violent protests and soldiers fighting in faraway places became part of our daily lives. The Vietnam War began showing up on television every night, and a younger audience weaned on the unbelievable drastically changed its demands of the medium. ''There was the disenfranchised youth saying, 'Nothing on this box speaks to me,' '' Mr. Littlefield said. ''They had a desire to see shows that spoke to the world as it really was.''</p>
        <p>CBS canceled shows like ''Green Acres'' and ''The Beverly Hillbillies,'' filling the void with series like ''All in the Family,''  ''The Bob Newhart Show,''  ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ''M*A*S*H.'' Instead of being looking glasses offering passages to other worlds, the most popular sitcoms became mirrors reflecting everyday life.</p>
        <p>''We'd been through the Kennedy and King assassinations; it was the Me Generation,'' said Bruce Helford, executive producer of ''The Drew Carey Show'' and ''Norm'' for ABC and the upcoming ''Nikki'' for WB. ''Look, on 'Maude,' the title character had an abortion. Sitcoms had definitely lost their innocence.''</p>
        <p>There were occasional exceptions. ''Mork and Mindy,'' spun off from the very familiar and folksy ''Happy Days,'' had an alien-stuck-on-Earth premise and was a big hit. As the 80's and 90's moved along, there were some larger-than-real-life ideas, like a wise-cracking alien who resembled a sock puppet (''Alf'').</p>
        <p>However, the low concept of NBC shows like ''Cheers'' (friends hang out in a bar), ''The Cosby Show'' (an upper-middle-class black family copes with life), ''Family Ties'' (an upper-middle-class white family copes with life) and the godfather of them all, ''Seinfeld,'' ruled in the ratings. Of the few unreal comedies that did get on the air, most, from ''Meego,'' the tale of a space alien who moves in with a suburban family, to ''Teen Angel,'' in which a dead teenager comes back as a guardian angel for his best friend, looked very out of place and vanished quickly.</p>
        <p>''When you go in to pitch a series now, you have to be prepared to explain how the series will be grounded in reality,'' said the director and producer James Widdoes, whose ''Kiss Me Guido,'' about a gay man and his straight roommate, is on CBS's midseason schedule. ''You have to discuss what themes you'll be addressing in the relationships. If you mentioned the show was about a witch, the networks would just stare at you and ask, 'How is that real?' ''</p>
        <p>Suzanne Daniels, entertainment president of WB, added: ''That's the big difference between those older shows and the ones you see today. Writers today make a huge effort to make their shows relatable to their audience. In the earlier days, the writers just wanted to have fun with a particular setting. 'Mr. Ed' wasn't about a loner who had trouble relating to people. It was about a guy who talked to his horse. With shows now, the subtext has become the text.''</p>
        <p>Another explanation is that high concept still exists -- but with lower expectations.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the successful shows today have what I'd consider a high concept,'' said Jay Sandrich, the veteran television director whose credits run the conceptual gamut from ''My Favorite Martian'' to ''Mary Tyler Moore.''  ''A gay man lives with a straight woman. A couple gets married after their first date. It's just that the idea of what passes for a high concept has changed.''</p>
        <p>Into this world comes NBC's new comedy ''Cursed,'' which sounds like an old high-concept show dressed in new low-concept clothes. In the opening episode, the central character, played by Steven Weber, goes on a disastrous first date that ends with the woman putting a curse on him. From there on out, his life is a mess. However, the show's creators, Nat Bernstein and Mitchell Katlin, knew they had to spin their premise a certain way if they wanted to keep both network executives and viewers paying attention.</p>
        <p>''This isn't 'An Alien Is My Roommate,' '' Mr. Katlin said. ''The curse is an event that took place once, and doesn't have to happen every show. Our words in describing the show are, 'Have you ever had one of those days where you just think you've been cursed?' Our guy is someone who lives under a dark cloud.''</p>
        <p>MR. BERNSTEIN added: ''We're staying away from all that hocus-pocus. We want people to look at the show and say, 'That's plausible. That could happen.' Audiences are much more jaded and refined. They don't accept stupid behavior. We hope there is room for a sophisticated series that deals with some bizarre stuff.''</p>
        <p>They wanted to have things both ways. The titular curse is the situation around which the comedy begins, but ''we hope you're going to forget about the world he's in and be amused by the people in his world,'' Mr. Katlin said. Those people being ''a group of thirtysomething friends living in Chicago.''</p>
        <p>Even if it's a hit, it is unlikely ''Cursed'' will herald a return to high concept. Although Ms. Daniels of WB insisted that ''we're not seeing that sort of thing in show pitches, but we'd like to,'' Mr. Helford has had a different experience. ''If you pitch something like that, I think you'd hear, 'Wow, that's really interesting -- we'll think about it,' '' he said. ''I don't think they'd insult you to your face. Even with a good track record, a producer would have to do a lot of dancing to sell'' a high-concept comedy.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the networks are right. The television times have changed. After all, who would want to watch some program about a bunch of comedic strangers stuck on a deserted island with each other, forced into performing bizarre tasks to survive?</p>
