        <p>The Happy Bottom Riding Club</p>
        <p>The Life and Times of Pancho Barnes.</p>
        <p>By Lauren Kessler.</p>
        <p>Random House, $24.95.</p>
        <p>There is too much of this sort of thing in Lauren Kessler's biography of Pancho Barnes: ''Pancho's attitude toward sex was uncomplicated: She enjoyed it . . . enthusiastically, unapologetically, for the physical excitement, the jolt, the charge. Others might long for deep companionship, emotional sustenance and life commitment. Pancho just wanted to have fun.'' Oh, sure. A rich girl from Pasadena, stocky, moon-faced, lacking in waist, hips and neck, married off at the age of 19 to the rector of an upscale Episcopal parish, who declared to her, after a nuptial encounter four days delayed: ''I do not like sex. It makes me nervous. I see nothing in it, and I do not wish to have any more of it'' -- that rich girl, I say, needed a second life strategy to fall back on, and these were limited in 1921. Florence Leontine Lowe Barnes (1901-74) became a hellion. She started by shocking church ladies and went on to work in the movies, give tremendous parties, commit adultery, romp around Mexico and take up flying. In 1930 she was briefly the fastest woman in the world, at 196.19 miles per hour. She lost two or three fortunes and made new ones, usually smaller; married three more times, unwisely; devised numerous business schemes that failed through attention deficit; and soon after World War II entered legend (reported by Tom Wolfe in ''The Right Stuff'') as the foul-mouthed pal of test pilots and flying generals, operator of a resort and a private club, the Happy Bottom, near Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert, where, some people believed, fun was unlawfully for sale; certainly, Kessler seems to confirm, fun took place. Kessler, whose previous books include ''Stubborn Twig'' and ''Full Court Press,'' interviewed a great many people who knew Barnes, and has learned much about her in the paper trails that rich, cranky people leave in courts, banks and law offices. ''The Happy Bottom Riding Club'' seems entirely credible as to how Barnes lived, and I certainly hope it is true as to how much she enjoyed it.</p>
