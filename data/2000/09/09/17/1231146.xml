        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>So Oliver Stone will keep revising his films again and again [''Producing DVD's With Lavish Extras'' by Peter M. Nichols, Aug. 27]? Does this mean that the ''Nixon'' laser disc I purchased for $50 is no longer valid? And if I go out and buy the new version on DVD, with the extra footage, will that also be outdated a couple of years from now? Should I buy 100 versions of ''Nixon'' until Mr. Stone says that he got it right?</p>

        <p>Painters don't create a painting and, two years later, want to touch it up just to give us the definitive version. If we could bring van Gogh back to life, would we demand that he redo, say, ''Starry Night''? But this is precisely what Oliver Stone wants us to accept. He would serve his public better by not making them spend their hard-earned money on different versions of the same film. No one, not even he, is worth that much.</p>
