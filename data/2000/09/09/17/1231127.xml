        <p>TWO years ago, Mayor Thomas R. Suozzi said he was ecstatic when he welcomed the Regina Maris to Glen Cove. The three-masted barkentine would be a symbol of Glen Cove's ambitious waterfront revitalization, he said, and it would be restored to its former splendor.</p>

        <p>TWO years ago, Mayor Thomas R. Suozzi said he was ecstatic when he welcomed the Regina Maris to Glen Cove. The three-masted barkentine would be a symbol of Glen Cove's ambitious waterfront revitalization, he said, and it would be restored to its former splendor.</p>
        <p>''It's very appropriate that this restoration take place here, side by side with the rebirth of Glen Cove's marina district,'' Mayor Suozzi said as the 150-foot ship, built in Denmark in 1908, arrived in port, flags flying. The mayor, in a show of enthusiasm, climbed the rigging and waved to a crowd of spectators.</p>
        <p>But this summer there were no flags flying, and the mayor was not on hand when the Regina Maris settled to the bottom of Glen Cove Creek, taking on water faster than pumps could empty its aging, worm-eaten hull. At high tide, only the rigging is now visible. At low tide, the top of the deck emerges, as if taking a last few gasps of air. Two efforts by volunteers to raise the vessel have been unsuccessful, Glen Cove officials said.</p>
        <p>A still-determined Mayor Suozzi said last week, after meeting with aides about the vessel, that one more effort would be made within the next month to save the ship. If this fails, he said, ''she will be dismantled and cleared from the creek.'' He added, perhaps more than a little wryly, that he now understood why there were only two of the three-masted barkentines left in the world. (The other is the Gazela, last reported docked in Brazil.)</p>
        <p>A marine salvage company headed by Capt. Gerhard Schwisow of Savannah, Ga., has offered to raise the ship for a fee of $40,000. If the company fails, there would be no fee, the mayor said, ''and that would be the end of her.''</p>
        <p>If the Regina Maris can be raised, it could be towed to one of two dry docks, the closest in Hempstead Harbor and the other in Oyster Bay, It could then be pulled up onto dry ground, where repairs could be made, Mayor Suozzi said.</p>
        <p>The mayor said he did not regret his initial enthusiasm nor his protracted efforts to save the Regina Maris, which had been docked for almost a decade in Greenport before it was moved to Glen Cove. Greenport had decided that it could no longer assume responsibility for the ship, viewed as an insurance risk, and the village was planning to tow it out to sea for a maritime burial when Mr. Suozzi came to the rescue.</p>
        <p>Initially, the mayor was motivated by the story that the ship had been used to transport Jewish refugees from Denmark to Sweden to escape the Nazi Holocaust during World War II. But not long after the Regina Maris arrived in Glen Cove, a group of Jewish historians determined that the story was not true, ending hopes that Jewish groups might help to finance the ship's rescue.</p>
        <p>Leo Goldberger, a psychology professor at New York University and the editor of ''The Rescue of the Danish Jews: Moral Courage Under Stress'' (N.Y.U. Press, 1987), was among those asked by Glen Cove to research the vessel.</p>
        <p>When he was 13, Professor Goldberger escaped from Germany and the Holocaust on a boat bound for Sweden. He said that he, more than anyone, had wanted the stories about the Regina Maris to be true.</p>
        <p>Although shipping records show that the Regina Maris worked as a transport vessel in the Baltic Sea during the war, it was a two-masted ship named the Stella that was used as a rescue vessel, Professor Goldberger said. The Stella is still afloat in Elsinore Harbor in Denmark, he added.</p>
        <p>It will cost $2 million to $4 million to repair the Regina Maris, according to various official estimates, but a citizens group in Glen Cove only raised $25,000 for repairs, and of that, only $15,000 remains.</p>
        <p>''We need some real support and hefty donations from people within the maritime industry,'' the mayor said. ''So many people have come to me and waxed eloquent about the charm and mystery of such a tall ship, but they never come up with any money. And that's very frustrating.''</p>
        <p>What's left of the wooden hull is now wrapped in a huge plastic sheet in a vain effort to keep out the tides that flow back and forth through the planks. The riggings that hang listlessly above the water are rotted and falling apart.</p>
        <p>The Regina Maris -- the Latin name means Queen of the Sea --  spent most of its early years hauling freight in the North Sea. As late as the 1970's, it was still sailing, but it fell into disrepair in the 1980's, and repeated restoration efforts have failed to keep pace with the deterioration of its aging oak hull and fir decks.</p>
        <p>Before Greenport officials decided to let the vessel go, they called in Gifford Full, a consultant on the restoration of the U.S.S. Constitution docked in Boston. He recommended that the Regina Maris be scuttled.</p>
        <p>After the vessel was towed 90 miles from Greenport and into Hempstead Harbor, Mayor Suozzi described it as Glen Cove's ''good luck charm.''</p>
        <p>Now, he says, the Regina Maris has become a symbol of perseverance. ''I still think we can keep her alive,'' he said. ''After nearly 100 years afloat, I would hate to be the one to order her demise.''</p>
