        <p>Other than a little emotion infused by Dale Purinton's fists, the Rangers' 5-1 drubbing by the Philadelphia Flyers in a preseason game today could have easily been confused with any number of games from last season.</p>

        <p>Other than a little emotion infused by Dale Purinton's fists, the Rangers' 5-1 drubbing by the Philadelphia Flyers in a preseason game today could have easily been confused with any number of games from last season.</p>
        <p>''You're not going to achieve anything overnight,'' said Glen Sather, the Rangers' new president and general manger. ''We still have a way to go.''</p>
        <p>A long, long way, if the Rangers' opening preseason game was a sign of things to come.</p>
        <p>When asked if he could take anything positive out of his team's effort today, Ron Low, the Rangers' new coach, thought before replying.</p>
        <p>''Five-on-five we weren't bad,'' Low said of his team, which allowed four power-play goals.</p>
        <p>There were definitely not many highlights. Mark Messier, Brian Leetch, Mike Richter and the Czech line of Petr Nedved, Radek Dvorak and Jan Hlavac did not play.</p>
        <p>Tim Taylor, who missed time last season because of reasons ranging from appendicitis to a concussion to a freakish accident suffered here (a sliver of wood from his hockey stick became embedded in his hand), left today's game with an injury above his left eye. He needed eight stitches to close the wound, and Low said later that Taylor also felt woozy, perhaps indicating that he had sustained another concussion.</p>
        <p>The rest of the Rangers, for the most part, appeared old, slow or uninspired, or a combination of the above. An exception was Manny Malhotra, who skated well and with aggression.</p>
        <p>The Flyers were 4 for 8 on the power play, Mark Recchi scoring two of his three goals with the man advantage.</p>
        <p>''It looked like we hadn't killed any penalties in practice before today, and we haven't,'' Low said. ''But to be that poor might be disheartening, to say the least.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers were 1 for 5 on their power play, and 0 for 2 with a two-man advantage. They even failed on a penalty shot when Brad Smyth was stopped by Roman Cechmanek.</p>
        <p>The Rangers' only goal was by Mike York, one of the few bright spots on the team last season and the best player in camp this fall.</p>
        <p>The most exciting player has been Purinton, who slammed Keith Primeau to the ice today. Purinton fought Primeau at Madison Square Garden last spring in the Rangers' final game of the season, Purinton's National Hockey League debut.</p>
        <p>''Two games, two tilts,'' Purinton said, referring to his tussles with Primeau.</p>
        <p>The Rangers have eight preseason games left to work out the considerable kinks in their game. They will have to improve on special teams. Low said the league had already announced that the officiating would be tighter this season, especially regarding slashing calls; the Rangers were called for slashing twice today.</p>
        <p>When asked if he was satisfied with his team's aggression, Low said: ''It was the wrong kind. You're not going to get away with a slash anymore. We have to throw it out of our repertory and get into the hits.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>GLEN SATHER did not sound optimistic that defenseman MIKE MOTTAU would be coming to contract terms with the Rangers soon. ''It doesn't look like it's going to happen right now,'' he said. . . . The Rangers will have an open practice at Madison Square Garden at noon Monday. That will most likely be the only time MARK MESSIER can be seen by fans on the Garden's ice this preseason. The Rangers have not announced it, but they want Messier's return to the Garden ice to come Oct. 11, at their home opener against Montreal.</p>
