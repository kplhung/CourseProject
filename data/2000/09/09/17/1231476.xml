        <p>In a deal that ends the independence of one of the proudest firms on Wall Street, the Chase Manhattan Corporation agreed to buy J. P. Morgan &amp; Company for $30.9 billion in stock. Chase hopes the deal, the fourth huge financial merger recently, will enhance its global standing as a provider of financing to major corporations. It should have little effect on consumers,  a shrinking share of Chase's business. Chase is keeping Morgan's renowned brand -- derived from founder John Pierpont Morgan -- and renaming itself J. P. Morgan Chase &amp; Company.</p>
