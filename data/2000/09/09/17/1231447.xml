        <p>LAWRENCE KASDAN, still best known for ''Body Heat'' and ''The Big Chill,'' must have been in sunnier mood when he wrote and directed MUMFORD (1999). The setting is a small Midwestern town, and the hero is a newly arrived young psychotherapist (Loren Dean, a charmer), who seems to work wonders. His patients include a lovely young woman (Hope Davis) whose catalog shopping has taken over the house, and the local baby billionaire (Jason Lee), who likes to spend his days skateboarding. The film is irreverent in a playful way, and the message seems to be that the best therapy in the world is inventing a new life and finding the right person to share it - Saturday at 8 p.m., Saturday/Early Sunday at 3:20 a.m. on Starz.</p>

        <p>LAWRENCE KASDAN, still best known for ''Body Heat'' and ''The Big Chill,'' must have been in sunnier mood when he wrote and directed MUMFORD (1999).

        <p>Take a naive N.Y.U. film student (Matthew Broderick, even more baby-faced than he is now) just off the train from vermont, a throaty Mafioso (Marlon Brando) with a distinct resemblance to Don Corleone and a $350,000-a-plate dinner in which the entree is endangered Komodo dragon in a basil cream sauce, and you have THE FRESHMAN (1990). Mr. Brando and Mr. Broderick's surprisingly sweet on-screen chemistry make this comedy, about a part-time job that gets complicated, a low-key winner. Andrew Bergman wrote and directed - Sunday at 3 p.m. on Channel 11.</p>
        <p>It's a gentle world that H. G. Wells's alter ego (Rod Taylor) leaves behind in THE TIME MACHINE (1960) when he tries out the title device and travels to 800,000 A.D. But he's horrified when he sees what the human race has been reduced to in the distant future: the passive, childlike Eloi (among them, Yvette Mimieux as the ultimate dumb blonde) and the monstrous Morlocks, who live underground and eat Eloi for breakfast. Literally. The Oscar-winning special effects don't look like much 40 years later, but Wells's imagination and his reflections on humanity are as seductive as wever. George Pal directed - Sunday at 4:30 p.m. on Sci Fi.</p>
        <p>Everybody always talks about the skiing scenes in Michael Ritchie's DOWNHILL RACER (1969), and they are spectacular, but even if Alpine scenery leaves you cold the film has something meaningful to offer. Robert Redford stars as a young ski champion with Olympic ambitions and a bad case of Schadenfreude (he'd tell you that's what winning is all about). He's also too gorgeous for his own good, and no one ever taught him to say please or thank you. The film is a portrait of an empty life, released at a time when Hollywood seemed to have just discovered that emptiness was a bad thing. Gene Hackman is the coach who is never afraid to tell Mr. Redford's character when he's not good enough, and Camilla Sparv is the beautiful international type who may actually top him at shallowness - Saturday at 8 p.m. on Channel 9.</p>
        <p>She's a rich high school girl, a clotheshorse, a matchmaker and a virgin. She's Cher, Jane Austen's Emma transported to 1990's Beverly Hills, and Alicia Silverstone plays her perfectly in Amy Heckerling's CLUELESS (1995), a satire without a mean bone in its body. Stacey Dash plays the heroine's best friend, Dionne; Brittany Murphy is the dowdy new girl at school who's ripe for a beauty-fashion makeover; and Paul Rudd is the disapproving but devastatingly handsome stepbrother, Cher's own mr. Knightley - Tuesday at 9 p.m. on USA.</p>
