        <p>Priests who feel they are leaving no legacy as they near retirement (front page, Sept. 10) should be consoled by one thing.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Priests who feel they are leaving no legacy as they near retirement (front page, Sept. 10) should be consoled by one thing. Even though their younger colleagues have lost the vision of Vatican II, those of us who are middle-aged, educated lay Catholics have taken this vision to heart.</p>
        <p>We have followed the example of those Vatican II priests: in the soup kitchens we run, in the prisons where we volunteer, in the hospitals where we serve. We have educated our children to be people who treasure the environment and other human beings -- and who volunteer in record numbers to work on social service projects.</p>
