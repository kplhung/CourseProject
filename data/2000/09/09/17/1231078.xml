        <p>One of the world's largest exhibitions of the work of the jeweler and goldsmith Peter Carl Faberge has opened at the Riverfront Arts Center at 800 South Madison Street in Wilmington, Del. ''Faberge'' features more than 1,000 works from museums and private collections, including objects from the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg and the Moscow Kremlin Museums that have never been seen in the United States.</p>
        <p>Faberge was the official jeweler of czarist Russia, and the show highlights the luxurious tastes of Russian and European aristocracies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Exhibits include at least 10 imperial Easter eggs, a family of silver rabbits from the former collection of the king of Bulgaria, and decorative boxes and cigarette cases in gold and enamel. Several items are on loan from royal families, such as a gold- and silver-mounted diamond-set tiara shaped as a myrtle wreath from the Duke and Duchess of Westminster.</p>
