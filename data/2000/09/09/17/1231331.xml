        <p>ONE of Thomas Nast's most famous political cartoons of the last days of the corrupt Tweed Ring, which ran the Tammany Hall political machine and New York City from 1866 to 1871, shows the group's leaders standing in a circle, each pointing a finger at the man to his right. The cartoon's label reads, '' 'Twas Him.''</p>
        <p>The same refrain is being heard as Congressional investigators try to figure out what went wrong with defective Firestone tires that are blamed in close to 150 deaths around the world, mostly in Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles equipped with the tires.</p>
        <p>The Ford Motor Company accuses Firestone of making poor-quality tires and of failing to tell the automaker's officials when they asked whether there was a problem. Firestone acknowledged last Tuesday that it made ''bad tires,'' but blames Ford for the Explorer's tendency to do cartwheels when a tire fails at high speed. Firestone's unionized workers point at replacement workers who made tires in Decatur, Ill., during a labor dispute from 1994 to 1996, when tire quality appears to have been worst of all.</p>
        <p>Republicans criticize the Clinton administration's regulators for not spotting the problem sooner. Democrats fire back that it was the Reagan administration that killed proposed tire safety regulations in 1981 and cut the federal budget for traffic safety regulation so deeply that, as is clear when the figures are adjusted for inflation, it has never recovered.</p>
        <p>The only people in the whole tire fiasco who seem happy are the personal injury lawyers, who are looking forward to more huge fees. But they say little about why they kept almost two dozen fatal crashes out of a federal database of safety problems for years, even as they quietly filed multimillion-dollar lawsuits against Firestone and sometimes Ford as well.</p>
        <p>In truth, there is plenty of discredit to go around. It sometimes seemed during Congressional hearings over the last two weeks as though everyone involved was simply sniping at one another. Yet each revealed another piece of the puzzle that another might have tried to hide, yielding a much fuller picture of what went wrong.</p>
        <p>Firestone made poor-quality tires, although the precise reason why the tires' treads are loosely attached to the steel and rubber inside may require further weeks or months of sleuthing.</p>
        <p>The fairly low pressure that Ford and Firestone chose for the tires, 26 pounds per square inch, made the problem worse. As John Lampe, Firestone's executive vice president, has mentioned over and over, vehicles are supported mostly by the air in a tire, although the structure of the tire itself plays a role. Lousy tires with little air in them -- the tires also seem to have been prone to leaks -- are a doomed combination.</p>
        <p>Yet tire problems alone do not explain the extraordinary deadliness of crashes involving Firestone tires. The number of the tires replaced under warranty before the recall, a rough indication of how often the tires were falling apart, was fairly low, just four-tenths of 1 percent, according to documents obtained by Congressional investigators.</p>
        <p>The problem lay in how often people were killed when the tires failed. The death rate per 1,000 warranty claims appears to have been more than 80 times higher in the current recall than in the only other big tire recall in American history, the 1978 recall of Firestone 500 tires.</p>
        <p>The deadliness of the tire failures is particularly surprising because all of the vehicles equipped with the current tires had smooth interiors with rounded edges designed to cushion occupants during impacts, and many had air bags. Yet occupants were more likely to die than in the cars of the 1970's, which still had plenty of sharp edges inside and no air bags. And most people in the 1970's did not use seat belts.</p>
        <p>One reason that the current crashes are so lethal may be that people have been driving faster since the end of the national speed limit of 55 miles per hour. Most of the deaths for which a speed is known were in sport utilities going faster than 55, and even a seat belt and air bag provide limited protection at such speeds.</p>
        <p>But a big part of the answer seems to be that most of the deaths linked to the current bad batches of Firestone tires occurred in sport utilities that rolled over, something that few of the cars with bad tires in the late 1970's did. One striking feature of the current string of crash deaths is that all involve sport utilities, usually Ford Explorers, even though an unknown but apparently substantial number of the bad tires were also mounted on pickup trucks. Fully 80 percent of the deaths in sport utilities involved rollovers, the deadliest kind of crash.</p>
        <p>Rollovers have been a problem for sport utility vehicles since the invention of the Jeep at the start of World War II. Firestone's Mr. Lampe even went so far as to testify last Tuesday that the tire maker missed evidence of a tire problem as it began receiving damage claims and lawsuits because it simply expected large numbers of sport utility vehicles to roll over. Mr. Lampe and Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, each pointed out last week that the tire problems accounted for a tiny share of all fatal rollovers in Explorers.</p>
        <p>''We believed until recently that the accidents and claims reported were simply part of supplying a large number of vehicles like the S.U.V.'s and light trucks,'' Mr. Lampe said.</p>
        <p>For various reasons relating to engineering and physics, the difficulty of controlling a vehicle that has lost a tire increases with the height of its center of gravity. Sport utilities have high centers of gravity, making them harder to control with just three tires and more prone to roll over.</p>
        <p>While the number of sport utilities rolling over has been climbing because there are more of the vehicles on the road, the frequency of rollovers per million sport utilities has actually been declining for years, as automakers have made their S.U.V.'s much bigger and heavier. For crashes of all types, including those not involving rollovers, sport utilities now have no higher an overall death rate for occupants than cars. This is because many of the rollover deaths that used to occur in sport utilities have been effectively transferred in recent years to the cars they hit. Automakers have been losing rollover lawsuits for decades but have never been successfully sued for the damage that their products inflict on other vehicles and their occupants.</p>
        <p>The Explorer has a lower frequency of fatal rollovers than most midsized sport utility vehicles, although Explorer occupants are still twice as likely to die in rollovers as occupants of midsized cars. That has led some Ford officials to suggest that if a less stable sport utility had been equipped with the same bad batch of tires, the results might have been even deadlier.</p>
        <p>Some of Ford's rivals agree. ''To some extent, I'm surprised this kind of thing hasn't happened before,'' said one engineer at another automaker, adding that tire making ''isn't a science, it's an art.''</p>
