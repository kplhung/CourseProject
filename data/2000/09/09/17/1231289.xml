        <p>All the talk at a Merrill Lynch analysts conference last week seemed to be about the people who weren't there.</p>
        <p>The three-day event was scheduled to include presentations by 50 chief executives of banking and financial services companies. But five backed out of their presentations at the last minute, three of them after the conference had begun. And they weren't just random no-shows.</p>
        <p>First to pull out were Joe L. Roby, chief executive of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, and Blake Darcy, who runs the firm's online subsidiary, DLJ Direct; they begged off a few weeks ago when Donaldson agreed to be acquired by Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
        <p>Next, on Tuesday, Douglas A. Warner III, chairman of J. P. Morgan, said he would not make his scheduled presentation later that day. Rumors started flying of an imminent merger, followed in the afternoon by reports that Morgan was about to be acquired by Chase Manhattan -- whose chief executive, William B. Harrison Jr., was due to speak Wednesday morning. Then he, too, sent regrets.</p>
        <p>When Kenneth D. Pasternak, chief executive of Knight Trading Group, a major Nasdaq market maker, also canceled his Tuesday appearance, more speculation swirled, and Knight's stock jumped; on Friday, the company issued a statement noting the rumors about possible mergers but declining to comment on them.</p>
        <p>Amid such upheaval, what's a conference planner to do? Judah S. Kraushaar, the Merrill Lynch executive who organized the event, said that all was not lost. Morgan sent Nicolas S. Rohatyn, a senior technology executive, to take Mr. Warner's place, and the panel discussion in which Mr. Pasternak was to have taken part made do with one less panelist.</p>
        <p>''It actually became somewhat comical,'' said Mr. Kraushaar, when attendees started teasing executives who did show up that their companies must not be doing anything newsworthy.</p>
