        <p>WITH the academic year now at full speed on its 19 campuses, some 200,000 City University of New York students are finding themselves threading their way around cement mixers, pile drivers, cranes and jackhammers, in some places circumventing holes in the ground where buildings will rise, in others attending lectures in temporary trailers or at odd hours while classroom buildings undergo renovation.</p>
        <p>At Queens College, Powdermacher Hall, which contains 40 percent of the classrooms, is out of commission, swathed in scaffolding before an almost complete overhaul. At City College, slabs of schist and terra cotta lie on the ground, ready to be installed as part of the refacing of the facade of the elegant Shepard Hall.</p>

        <p>WITH the academic year now at full speed on its 19 campuses, some 200,000 City University of New York students are finding themselves threading their way around cement mixers, pile drivers, cranes and jackhammers, in some places circumventing holes in the ground where buildings will rise, in others attending lectures in temporary trailers or at odd hours while classroom buildings undergo renovation.</p>
        <p>At Queens College, Powdermacher Hall, which contains 40 percent of the classrooms, is out of commission, swathed in scaffolding before an almost complete overhaul. At City College, slabs of schist and terra cotta lie on the ground, ready to be installed as part of the refacing of the facade of the elegant Shepard Hall.</p>
        <p>At Kingsborough Community College, the first shovel of ground will soon be turned for what will be called Academic Village, a building that will contain facilities for a variety of programs serving the surrounding community as well as classrooms and computer labs. At Baruch College in Manhattan, the interior configuration of a megastructure that occupies an entire city block is beginning to take shape.</p>
        <p>For CUNY -- in the third year of a $1 billion, five-year plan -- all this is simply business as usual, with projects rolling out in orderly fashion. ''The beginning of the plan entailed a lot of design,'' said Meghan Moore-Wilk, chief of planning for CUNY, ''so now we are moving into the construction phase.''</p>
        <p>The university has been on a concerted campaign to upgrade its facilities for more than 30 years. ''This is nothing new, it continues a program that began with the enactments of the City University Construction Fund Act by the State Legislature in 1966,'' said Donal Farley, a former longtime vice chancellor for facilities who is now a consultant. ''Before that, the university was noted for its excellent faculty and students but grossly inadequate facilities, and since then it has been building new buildings and rehabilitating and reconfiguring existing ones.''</p>
        <p>To Matthew Goldstein, the chancellor of the university, who was president of Baruch College from 1991 to 1998, the university's physical plant represents far more than classrooms, libraries and research laboratories.</p>
        <p>''It is a beacon for students not only to come but to stay on campus and participate in its life,'' he said. ''Universities are organic, they can only live and breathe if students are there, and they will only be there if they feel they are in a pleasant and exciting environment.''</p>
        <p>The chancellor is now seeing the fruition of one of his goals as president of Baruch: development of a large new academic center that will physically transform the school.</p>
        <p>The center is a single structure that elsewhere would constitute an entire quadrangle. Filling the entire block between Lexington and Third Avenues from 24th to 25th Streets, it is a massive but not overwhelming design, much of it convex white aluminum panels set atop a red brick base. Work on it was begun during the chancellor's tenure as president of Baruch.</p>
        <p>''It takes an urban environment and transforms it into commodious space for students,'' he said. ''I think it is fabulous. Students feel elevated by it.'' The building, which cost $279 million, will save $18 million in annual rents now being paid on leased space.</p>
        <p>Asked to assess how other CUNY branches were measuring up to his vision, he said, ''Not all of them are near that, but they are all on their way.'' In particular he singled out for praise the Graduate School and University Center, which has moved into part of the former B. Altman department store at 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, the College of Staten Island, Brooklyn College and Lehman College in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The new facilities are rising on campuses that, in most cases, are also drawing more students. The enrollment of freshmen at the senior colleges rose significantly this semester, on some campuses by more than 20 percent. Though some colleges are more strained than others by the growth, a certain amount of expansion has been built into plans for new construction and renovation.</p>
        <p>Once paid for solely by the city, the capital program of the 11 senior colleges, the graduate school, the law school, which is located at Queens College and the medical school at City College, has been financed through bonds issued by the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York since 1966.  The seven community colleges are also dependent on bonds for capital improvements,  half financed by the city and half by the state.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, the Legislature authorized the $1 billion five-year plan, but the university still submits a budget for legislative approval every year indicating which projects it will pursue and at what cost.</p>
        <p>For the coming year, 2001-2002, ''The request to the state and the governor will be in the neighborhood of $350 million,'' said Emma E. Macari, vice chancellor for facilities, planning, construction and management. For the following year, she said, it will probably be a little more than $240 million, or what is left of the $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Dividing the pie among 19 campuses, deciding which school gets what and in what order is an intricate process based on a formula of priorities. Health and safety conditions take precedence but other considerations include the technology infrastructure, enrollment , academic needs and energy conservation.</p>
        <p>Each campus has a master plan that is revised every 10 years or so. ''It is the master plan that places an institution on a forward track,'' said Christoph Kimmich, president of Brooklyn College and a former university interim chancellor. ''We put it together knowing it is a process with consequences that will shape how we do our instructional business. It is crystal-ball gazing.''</p>
        <p>Every prospective building is ''programmed'' before construction starts. ''That means figuring out what goes into it, in what configuration, with whose input and with what room for growth and improvement,'' Dr. Kimmich said. ''For example, we are trying to build a building on our West Quad with student services, athletics, a cafe, bookstore, registration, admissions, student lounges. We know the square footage but not how it will configure at this point, so we are dabbling with the future in a major way.''</p>
        <p>Like customers waiting for their numbers to be called, colleges wait their turn for funding for the various phases of their projects.</p>
        <p>With the Baruch venture a year from occupancy, attention is turning toward the next major endeavor: a new building for the overcrowded John Jay College of Criminal Justice on the West Side of Manhattan. Since it is budgeted for about $400 million, said Ms. Macari, the university's vice chancellor for construction and management, ''more than one-third of the billion dollars in the five-year plan is going to John Jay.''</p>
        <p>For Gerald W. Lynch, president of John Jay, the selection was good news. ''I've been president since 1977,'' he said, ''and we've been panting for this for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Following are some of the major changes students are encountering or will see in the next few years at a variety of CUNY campuses:</p>
        <p>City College  Former Gym to Be A Biology Center</p>
        <p>Founded in 1849 by popular referendum and first situated at the present locale of Baruch College at 23rd Street and Lexington Avenue, City College is the oldest of the university's schools and its bastion of architectural tradition. It relocated to uptown to 138th Street and Convent Avenue in 1907 and has now spread out to encompass the area between 130th and 141st Street from Amsterdam to St. Nicholas Avenue.</p>
        <p>Five of its original buildings, all landmarked, are undergoing replacement of their deteriorating stone facades in what, according to the architect in charge, Joseph Fuller Jr., of Fuller and D'Angelo, is the largest terra cotta renovation in North America.</p>
        <p>The largest and most majestic of the Gothic buildings, Shepard Hall, is now being refaced in a painstakingly exact and expensive -- $84 million -- process.</p>
        <p>As evocative of tradition as the Gothic buildings are, the Park Gym building, which once housed the Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart women's gymnasium, points to the future.</p>
        <p>It will be reconfigured as the New York Structural Biology Center, a joint venture of nine health research institutions. Sections of the floor where basketball was once played have been cut out for four nuclear magnetic resonance machines that will be sunk into bedrock.</p>
        <p>The machines will enable researchers to visualize the three-dimensional structure of molecules, increasing the understanding of the growth of cells and spread of disease.</p>
        <p>Brooklyn College  $72 Million Addition For the Library</p>
        <p>''Our first target is our library project, and it is right on target,'' said Dr. Kimmich, the college president, speaking of the  105,000-square-foot expansion being built at the south wall of the existing library.</p>
        <p>While the main structural work is well advanced, what it will contain remains far from evident to casual onlookers. ''This will be an electronic library, the future backbone of the entire campus, with all fiber-optic cables tied back here,'' said Steve Czirak, assistant vice president for facilities, during a tour of the premises.</p>
        <p>The original 1937 La Guardia Hall library and the 1959 Gideonse tension are also undergoing improvement. The new addition is projected to cost $72 million and will be finished by next August.</p>
        <p>Another significant undertaking is the redevelopment of the West Quad of the campus to conform to the original master plan, a landscaped green commons lined with red brick Georgian buildings. When that is accomplished, that end of the campus will match the East Quadrangle, which bears a  resemblance to Harvard Yard.</p>
        <p>The West Quad, to be designed by Rafael Vinoly, will include a new building to consolidate student and campus services and the physical education department as well as add classroom space. The cost is estimated at $83.5 million, with the target date for occupancy set at August 2004.</p>
        <p>Queens College  A Makeover For Powdermacher</p>
        <p>The major undertaking at the 75-acre Queens College campus in Flushing is the Powdermacher Hall makeover. ''We're looking forward to having state-of-the-art instructional technology and multimedia classrooms,'' said Russ Hotzler, the interim president, who is CUNY's university dean for academic affairs. Mitchell/Giurgola Architects has designed the $57 million project, expected to be completed in 2003.</p>
        <p>A study is now beginning to find a permanent campus site for the Queens College School for Math, Science and Technology, a 600-pupil prekindergarten-through-eighth-grade school operated jointly by the New York City Board of Education and the college. It is now housed in three temporary trailers.</p>
        <p>La Guardia Community  An Opportunity For Expansion</p>
        <p>Situated in an industrial area of Long Island City just off the 59th Street Bridge, this 27-year-old school stands in stark contrast to Kingsborough. Established in an old munitions factory, it is housed in three buildings and rented space in a fourth.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, it bought one of the three buildings in the failed International Design Center plus a nearby parking garage on Thomson Avenue for $54 million and is now seeking funds for alterations to the showrooms and offices.</p>
        <p>''This is an incredible opportunity for the college,'' said Gail O. Mellow, new president of the school, which is known for computer science. ''It will allow us not only to get space we need for traditional academic programs but great high-tech space. We are hoping to develop a very vibrant center for students and capitalize on the recent designation of Long Island City as a high-tech district.''</p>
        <p>The college is now ensconced on three floors. ''Eventually we will occupy the entire building,'' Dr. Mellow said. ''We hope to do that slowly and to share our space with local businesses. We want to provide an incubator for new businesses. Our students go out on internships and need good placements.''</p>
        <p>With renovation planned to fall into three phases, Dr. Mellow is seeking $11 million for financing for the first phase. ''We are overcrowded and have been stealing internal space to create classes, turning student lounges into classrooms and classroom into computer labs,'' she said. But city financing has yet to be allocated and, she said, ''In the meantime, we're making do.''</p>
        <p>Kingsborough Community  Academic Village By the Beach</p>
        <p>Two major projects are either under way or imminent at Kingsborough Community College in the Manhattan Beach section of southern Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Bids for construction of a 40,000-square-foot building to be known as the Academic Village are now being evaluated by the Dormitory Authority. It is to contain a variety of facilities for the neighboring community, including a child care center that will serve 25 children at a time, continuing-education offices, offices for the ''My Turn'' program for the elderly, a meeting room for the local community board, seven classrooms and four computer labs.</p>
        <p>The $16.7 million building has been designed by Gruzen Samton Architects in collaboration with Davis Brody Bond. Completion is expected in about 18 months.</p>
        <p>In the other new venture, the foundation and steel frame for the $45.4 million Leon Goldstein High School for the Sciences, operated in conjunction with the Board of Education, are now in place. Completion is expected by February 2002. The school, named for the longtime president of the college, has been designed by the city's School Construction Authority, with the exterior by Davis Brody Bond to ensure that it relates to existing buildings.</p>
        <p>CUNY's facilities planners point to the 37-year-old community college as a success for their approach to design.</p>
        <p>''This is probably the best example of how a master plan works,'' Mr. Farley, the former university vice chancellor, said of the buildings, which are soft in hue and individually distinctive but harmonious with one another.</p>
        <p>The 70-acre site, once excess federal property, was sold to the city for $1, and the planners had the benefit of being able to start from scratch, although with the use of eight temporary buildings.</p>
        <p>''The advantage is that five buildings were built between 1973 and 1976 under the same administration with the same folks at the same table,'' said Ms. Moore-Wilk, the university's chief of planning. ''Even though there were different architects, there was complete continuity.'' All the buildings are connected either by underground passages or bridges.</p>
        <p>The school has a picture-postcard setting. Surrounded on three sides by water, it is the only campus in the city on a beach. The site has created a need not felt elsewhere: a bulkhead sea wall repair is being done for $7.2 million.</p>
        <p>John Jay College  A New Building For the Campus</p>
        <p>If there is one college that is the centerpiece of CUNY's planning now, it is John Jay, which will be dramatically altered by the construction of a new building.</p>
        <p>''It will be the same order of magnitude as Baruch and will create a campus for the college, not just a couple of buildings across a city avenue,'' said Lia Gartner, director of the CUNY department of design, construction and management.</p>
        <p>Since its move to the Lincoln Center neighborhood in 1973, the college has been housed in two buildings diagonally across from each other on 10th Avenue between 58th and 60th Streets, forcing many of its  10,000 students to cross the street during class breaks.</p>
        <p>The new building, behind the Dutch-Flemish style Haaren Hall, a former high school, will fill space now used as a parking lot and will stretch to 11th Avenue. The design phase, which is about to begin, is expected to take two years, to be followed by about three years of construction. Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill was approved last week by the trustees to design the building, which will replace North Hall , a former shoe warehouse, and will accommodate 80 percent of the classrooms.</p>
        <p>''We are one of the most crowded of the City University divisions, with one of the lowest square-foot-per-student allocations,'' said Dr. Lynch, president of the college. ''This will let us expand and still be below average for the university.''</p>
        <p>Though the design has yet to be done, Dr. Lynch said, ''It will be meant to complement Haaren rather than attack it. We want it to be a dramatic creative burst of energy that will show the dynamism of the field of criminal justice and of liberal arts.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 24, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about construction projects of the City University of New York referred imprecisely to its founding. Voters approved a referendum to establish what became City College in 1847; the first students enrolled in 1849.</p>
        <p>The article also omitted the names of the architectural firms that designed the addition for Brooklyn College library. They were Buttrick White &amp; Burtis of New York City and Shepley Bulfinch Richardson &amp; Abbott of Boston. The article also misspelled the name of a building being renovated at Queens College. It is Powdermaker Hall, not Powdermacher.</p>
