        <p>The city has taken more than six years to renovate a building it owns in Downtown Brooklyn, and Howard Golden, the borough president, who called the lengthy project ''a particular embarrassment,'' wants the work finished fast. But city officials say they need nine more months.</p>
        <p>At issue is exterior work being done on the building, 345 Adams Street, which provides office space in the Civic Center for several city agencies.</p>
        <p>''Your agency began a renovation of this highly visible building more than six years ago, which resulted in the placement of scaffolding on its Adams, Willoughby and Pearl Street facades,'' Mr. Golden wrote in August to William J. Diamond, commissioner of the Department of Citywide Administrative Services.</p>
        <p>''It is a particular embarrassment to note that the City of New York is directly responsible for the single most significant visual blight in downtown Brooklyn,'' Mr. Golden wrote. He added that he first contacted the city in July 1998 about the issue and in December 1998 received a promise from Mr. Diamond that removing the scaffolding would be a top agency priority.</p>
        <p>But work is ''being pursued in a desultory fashion or not at all for long intervals,'' Mr. Golden continued, adding that the sidewalk sheds were impeding pedestrians.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 30, Mr. Diamond replied to the borough president, saying, ''We agree with your statement to expedite the project.'' He said the scaffolding would start to be dismantled in sections beginning in late December.</p>
        <p>''By May 2001, all scaffolding and sidewalk sheds will be removed from the job site,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Denise Collins, a department spokeswoman, said the project took so long because the building had to be stabilized before repairs could begin on the brickwork, masonry, terra cotta features and windows.</p>
        <p>''It was actually two projects, done back to back,'' Ms. Collins said.</p>
