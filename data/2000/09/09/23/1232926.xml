        <p>Shaken by the relentless decline of Europe's unified currency, the euro, the European, American and Japanese central banks undertook a surprise rescue attempt today to fight what they called a threat to the world economy.</p>
        <p>Their move, announced as financial ministers from the Group of 7 industrialized nations arrived here in advance of a meeting Saturday, was the first time in two years that central banks had staged a coordinated currency intervention -- and the first time ever that they had done so in support of a European currency.</p>
        <p>The action also represented a shift by the United States Treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, who had consistently opposed calls for intervention and as recently as Thursday had reiterated support for a strong dollar. His comments were widely interpreted at the time as ruling out United States participation in any attempt to strengthen the euro against the dollar.</p>
        <p>The banks bought billions of euros with dollars, yen and British pounds in the intervention, pushing the euro's value up to 90 cents from 85 cents. The euro later slipped back to settle at 87.87 cents.</p>
        <p>The currency had fallen below 85 cents from its initial price of $1.18 in January 1999, a decline of almost 30 percent that disheartened euro supporters, who had seen the new currency as a symbol of their broader ambitions for European unity.</p>
        <p>The intervention underlined fears that Europe faces a potential economic shock from the combination of a sinking common currency and soaring oil prices. Because oil is bought and sold in dollars, the recent rise in the price of oil has hurt European consumers much more than those in the United States.</p>
        <p>This has heightened inflation pressure across Europe and could force the European Central Bank to raise interest rates enough to slow the European economy. Robust European growth, in turn, has helped extend the record-long American expansion, so any slowdown in Europe could directly hurt the United States.</p>
        <p>Explaining United States participation in the currency action today, Mr. Summers cited risks to the global economy.</p>
        <p>''The United States and Japan joined with the European Central Bank in concerted intervention in exchange markets because of their shared concern about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro for the world economy,'' he said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The European Central Bank released an almost identical statement to explain its action.</p>
        <p>None of the central banks disclosed how much they spent to buy euros, but some currency market analysts speculated the total was as much as $10 billion.</p>
        <p>The success of today's intervention will depend on whether the euro climbs further or resumes its decline, and that may not be clear for weeks or even months. But the banks as a group have much more money at their disposal to buy euros, and the action today raised the prospect they could swoop in again if they decide the euro is too weak.</p>
        <p>''We didn't have a particular level in mind,'' said Otmar Issing, the European Central Bank's chief economist. ''That wasn't the goal.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, the United States decision to come to the aid of the Europeans made the joint action far more likely to restore some luster to the tarnished euro, several traders and analysts said.</p>
        <p>The United States so rarely seeks to interfere in currency markets that it carries considerable influence when it does. The global action also represents the first time that central banks of Japan, Canada and Britain joined the new European Central Bank in defending the euro, a vote of support as the European bank faces the toughest test of its short existence.</p>
        <p>The move is risky for the Clinton administration. The strong dollar has been an important ingredient of the record-breaking United States economic expansion by helping keep imports relatively inexpensive and inflation low.</p>
        <p>If today's market action were to help restore the euro to what many economists consider its value based on economic fundamentals, that would mean an increase of at least 15 percent, making a euro roughly equivalent to $1.</p>
        <p>Any sharp decline in the dollar would raise the cost of imports in the United States, add to the already enormous trade deficit, and possibly force the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates faster or higher than it otherwise would.</p>
        <p>One reason international financial officials had considered active American support for the euro unlikely is that the Clinton administration has generally avoided taking actions that might prove detrimental to Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign, which depends in part on the continued robustness of the American economy.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters in Washington today, Mr. Summers sought to navigate an apparent contradiction between his oft-repeated stance in favor of a strong dollar and the decision to sell dollars and buy euros on the global market. He said there had been no change in policy.</p>
        <p>''As I have said many times, a strong dollar is in the national interest of the United States,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Currency market analysts generally viewed the intervention as a good thing.</p>
        <p>C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute of International Economics in Washington, said he expected at least a modest rebound in the euro but did not foresee a serious threat to the dollar's long-term strength.</p>
        <p>''To say that you want a stronger euro is not to say that you want a weak dollar,'' he said, noting the prolonged rise of the dollar versus the currencies of all of America's major trading partners.</p>
        <p>The decline of the euro, which has been adopted by 11 European countries and will soon replace national currencies like the German mark and French franc, had political as well as economic repercussions.</p>
        <p>Denmark is to hold a national referendum on adopting the euro on Thursday, and the currency's weakness has seriously eroded popular support. In Britain, which has not adopted the euro, opposition to possible future participation has intensified. Numerous European officials have said that the euro's weakness threatens to undermine the trend toward economic integration and a more politically unified Europe.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't take a Ph.D. in political sciences to figure out that populist parties all across Europe will jump on the anti-euro bandwagon,'' said Joachim Fels, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London. He said the euro project had become engulfed in a ''confidence crisis.''</p>
        <p>The last time central banks cooperated to intervene in currency markets was in 1998, when the United States and Japan rescued the tumbling Japanese yen.</p>
        <p>At the time, financial panic had spread around Asia, and American officials were worried that any further deterioration in the yen could force China to devalue its currency. That was seen as likely to set off a fresh round of turmoil across the region, where the International Monetary Fund had just committed about $100 billion in emergency financing to shore up South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand.</p>
        <p>The intervention worked. The yen regained about 30 percent against the dollar. Giant investment funds and banks that had been betting on a further deterioration of the Japanese currency were caught off guard, and many were forced to abandon their positions with heavy losses.</p>
        <p>But the United States has not always had success influencing the price of the dollar.</p>
        <p>In 1985, the United States, Japan and European banks agreed, in what became known as the Plaza Accord, to jointly intervene and reverse a sustained dollar surge. The dollar traded then at more than 3 German marks, a record.</p>
        <p>The intervention pushed the dollar down -- but by far more than the authorities had anticipated. They subsequently sealed a second pact, known as the Louvre Accord, this time to buy dollars.</p>
        <p>That intervention fell short of its goal, bankers said. It took many years, until the sharp rise in the United States economy in the mid-1990's, for the dollar to regain its footing fully.</p>
        <p>In part because of that mixed record, Mr. Summers has often expressed a reluctance to intervene. His reputation was so well known that most currency traders and analysts had considered it highly unlikely that the United States would join any effort to strengthen the euro even if European nations and Japan tried to do so on their own.</p>
        <p>The intervention also caught the market off guard because even European officials appeared almost hopelessly disunited about whether there was a need for intervention.</p>
        <p>Italian, Spanish and German officials have asserted in recent days that a weak euro was not necessarily bad because it helped promote exports and stimulate growth. ''The weak euro makes our enterprises very happy,'' said Giuliano Amato, Italy's prime minister.</p>
        <p>Yet the European Central Bank had clearly been trying to shore up the euro. The bank raised interest rates six times in the last year, moves the market interpreted as currency support by making bank deposits and other assets denominated in euros more valuable. And the bank last week bought a modest amount of euros with some of its own foreign exchange reserves.</p>
        <p>None of those actions did much to support the currency, however, until today's joint intervention, which traders said had a profound effect for its sheer shock value.</p>
        <p>''I am astonished,'' said Axel Siedenberg, head of economic research at Deutsche Bank. ''We always had the impression that there was no awareness of the problem on the other side of the Atlantic.''</p>
        <p>The involvement of the United States won praise from numerous bankers, many of whom had gathered in Prague for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as Saturday's meeting of Group of 7  finance ministers.</p>
        <p>''It is a very good thing, and it is good because it was a coordinated intervention,'' said Martin Kohlhaussen, president of Commerzbank of Germany. ''I hope it is enough to give the euro the necessary push that it needs.''</p>
        <p>Banks Explain Their Reasons</p>
        <p>Following is the text of the statement of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt as it announced the joint action with other central banks yesterday:</p>
        <p>On the initiative of the European Central Bank, the monetary authorities of the United States and Japan joined with the European Central Bank in concerted intervention in exchange markets because of their shared concern about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro exchange rate for the world economy.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 28, 2000, Saturday  A front-page article on Sept. 23 about intervention by the world's major central banks to support Europe's unified currency, the euro,  misstated the record high of the dollar against the German mark. The 1985 figure, above 3 marks, was not the record; the dollar was as high as 4.2 marks in April 1956. A reader's e-mail message in late September about the error was initially mis directed at The Times, and this correction was further delayed by efforts to verify past price data.</p>
