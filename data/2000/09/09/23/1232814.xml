        <p>THERE are tremors in Sydney and Paris this morning, as the world prepares for the Olympics' greatest days: the track and field competition.</p>
        <p>One the sport's biggest stars is gone. In one of the most bizarre abdications in Olympic history, Marie-Jose Perec, the defending champion in the 200 and 400 meters, vanished. On Wednesday, the French sprinter said she was harassed by an intruder in her hotel room, packed her bags and left Sydney. Left Australia and was headed back to Paris.</p>
        <p>Why would the defending Olympic champion fly all the way to Sydney, talk about competing and then pull out?</p>
        <p>No one knows for sure, but John Smith, who coached Perec for two years, sensed that pride and vanity were at the root of Perec's decision to leave. ''I just don't know how fit she is,'' Smith said Friday night. ''She won't step out there unless she is ready to run; she's not going to go out there and get whipped.''</p>
        <p>In the spring of this year, Perec abruptly ended her relationship with Smith and the H.S.I. group. She told reporters that a large part of the reason was that she needed more attention.</p>
        <p>Last night, Smith said that Perec had simply been left behind. ''In 1996, I had her attention,'' Smith said. ''She wanted to make history, and she did. Once she made history -- after that I honestly don't think she wanted to run anymore.</p>
        <p>''There was pressure from her federation,'' Smith added. ''I think she felt obligated to run; but I don't think she wanted to run.''</p>
        <p>The years between the Games in Atlanta and Sydney were filled with one disaster after another: injury, then a devastating case of Epstein-Barr syndrome. Perec was not doing a lot of running and Smith was busy with other sprinters.</p>
        <p>''She was not running, and Inger Miller, Ato Boldon and Maurice Greene grew up,'' Smith said. ''When the train pulled out, Marie wasn't there. She wanted more attention but she had stopped growing.''</p>
        <p>Last spring. Perec abruptly left John Smith. Her choice as a coach to replace him was as bizarre as her decision to leave Sydney this week. Her new coach was Wolfgang Meier, husband and coach of Marita Koch. In 1992, in a news conference after she ran an Olympic-record 48.25 to win the 400 at the Barcelona Games, Perec all but called Koch a drug cheat.</p>
        <p>When asked if she thought she would break Koch's record of 47.60, Perec said: ''I think the world record is the race I ran today. I don't think that anyone has run under 49 seconds until now. To run this race today I didn't need any biological preparation.''</p>
        <p>Then, eight years later, Perec moved from sunny California to Germany to train with Koch's coach.</p>
        <p>The Australian news media have been brutal in explaining Perec's departure. For all the talk about Aussie friendliness, the venom with which the news media attacked Perec betrays more of an insecurity than a dislike.</p>
        <p>The Australians have vilified her. Called her chicken, said she was afraid of facing Cathy Freeman. Headlines screamed: ''On the Run''; ''Au Revoir, Perec''; ''Flying Home in Disgrace'' and ''Freaked-Out Perec Flies Home.''</p>
        <p>The Australians have it all wrong: Perec does not have a Freeman complex; Freeman has a Perec complex. At least she did. And Australia has a Perec complex. Perec, 32, has owned the 27-year-old Freeman: she is 7-2 against the Australian at 400 meters and 4-0 at 200.</p>
        <p>At the Atlanta Games in 1996, Perec defeated Freeman in the 400 meters and became the first athlete to win back-to-back 400-meter Olympic gold medals.</p>
        <p>What is it about Australia's fragile psyche that it needed to lambaste Perec?</p>
        <p>Perec is the defending Olympic champion; Freeman has been ordained as the champion-in-waiting. Today is merely a perfunctory prelude for ''Our Cathy,'' as the newspapers call her.</p>
        <p>In the other half of the equation, a fairy-tale career may be over. Perec arrived in Paris as a 16-year-old. She and her mother moved there from Basse-Terre on the island of Guadeloupe. Perec won her first major race in 1988. Perec made her first Olympic Games in 1988 at age 20. By 24, and the Barcelona Games, she was a French icon. Between 1992 and 1996, she did some modeling, left her French coach, teamed up with Smith in California.</p>
        <p>For the French, Perec's sudden withdrawal was a blow to the country's medal hopes. For Perec, the withdrawal allows her to wear the crown of the sport's queen for one more day. These are the Games where new track icons will be coronated: Freeman in Australia and Marion Jones on a larger plane for the United States. For Perec, the idea of having to hand over the reins drove her to leave Sydney.</p>
        <p>''I just think she saw circumstances were not in her favor,'' Smith said. ''She was not going to be embarrassed. I don't know how fit she was.</p>
        <p>''I think what Marie is wrestling with now is trying to find a purpose to run, to win. I think her problem is that she does not know how to say, 'Bye, bye.' ''</p>
