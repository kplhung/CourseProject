        <p>At this time last season, Lance Bennett was living a dream, on his way to a season-best 1,902 yards rushing and 21 touchdowns for Poly Prep's highly regarded football program and attracting attention from Division I scouts. Schools like Minnesota, Northwestern, Michigan and Rutgers, and Ivy League programs like Cornell and Columbia were all in pursuit of Bennett, then a senior.</p>
        <p>Yet for the past two months, Bennett, a 5-foot-5-inch, 175-pound tailback and punt returner, has not been a part of the college scene.</p>
        <p>Instead, Bennett is back at Poly Prep in Brooklyn, teaching the game rather than starring in it.</p>
        <p>The 18-year-old Bennett has put his dream of chasing National Football League glory aside for the time being to pursue another lifelong vision: a career in the entertainment business.</p>
        <p>''I decided to put my football career on hold and pursue a music career,'' said Bennett, the Blue Devils' youngest assistant coach. ''If I make hot music, the fans have no choice but to buy it. I won't have some coach telling me that I'm a third-down back just because I'm 5-foot-5.''</p>
        <p>Bennett hopes to write songs for Will Smith, the Grammy-winning musician and popular actor. Bennett has attracted the attention of Smith's producer, Omarr Rambert, who is negotiating to sign Bennett and his brother Lamar, 20, to a record contract.</p>
        <p>Bennett's 21-year-old brother, Lennie, a solo artist known as Kel Spencer, is already on Will Smith's label and co-wrote seven rap songs on Smith's most recent album, ''Willennium.''</p>
        <p>So what does Smith, who passed up his own scholarship offer to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to pursue a show business career, think of Bennett's decision?</p>
        <p>''I say, 'Go to college, play football and make records,' '' said Smith, who was a millionaire by the age of 18. ''It can be done. I myself am a multimedia assassin.''</p>
        <p>These days, Bennett, who has 4.38-second speed in the 40-yard dash, can be found on Poly's practice field, running wind sprints with former teammates, covering receivers on offensive drills and providing hints to running backs.</p>
        <p>''He taught them all the things to look for in a play,'' said Poly Prep Coach Dino Mangiero, who says his former star player has not missed a practice, a coaches meeting, a scrimmage or a game.</p>
        <p>''He taught the young kids how to hold the ball. How to run with it. What steps to take on certain plays. All the fundamental stuff that goes with running a football play.''</p>
        <p>Mangiero, a former N.F.L. defensive lineman with Kansas City, Seattle and New England, still believes Bennett has what it takes to play in the N.F.L.</p>
        <p>''Even though he's a small guy, you can't sell him short,'' Mangiero said. ''He may not be an every down back at the major league level. But he could be a kickoff or punt returner at any level. He's so fast, so talented and has such great moves.''</p>
        <p>Poly Prep (3-0), which has lost one game in four years, has featured a Division I talent in its backfield each of the past three seasons. Marcus Wilson is the heir apparent to Bennett, who was preceded by Brian Flores, who is now at Boston College.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I have to be real good to follow in the footsteps of those two,'' said Wilson, who has rushed for 556 yards on 51 carries and 8 touchdowns in 3 games. ''They both have very different running styles, and it has helped me learn to become as good a runner as I am today.''</p>
        <p>Wilson, who has been recruited by Maryland, Michigan State and Northwestern, said that Bennett's presence this season had served as an impetus for him.</p>
        <p>''When he came out to run sprints with us, it really motivated me to work harder because he didn't have to do that,'' said the 5-10 Wilson, who runs the 40 in 4.41 seconds. ''He's always telling me to stay low through the hole because I sometimes have trouble doing that because I'm kind of tall. He's helped me improve my vision by constantly telling me what I did wrong on a certain play. He's been a tremendous help to my development.''</p>
        <p>Bennett still hopes to play college ball, even though some coaches are concerned about his size. Bennett, who graduated with a 3.1 grade-point average, said some schools offered him a scholarship after viewing his highlight tape. ''Then they would come to Poly, look at my height and tell me that they've changed their mind. That's why I'm so motivated to prove people wrong. I figure I'll come back in a year or two with a few dollars in my pocket. I'll be a little bigger, a little faster and a little more mature.''</p>
