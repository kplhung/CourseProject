        <p>A stage direction in Athol Fugard's play ''Boesman and Lena'' says of its main characters, a mixed-race (or ''colored'') couple making their way across the cruel landscape of apartheid-era South Africa, that ''a life of hardship and dissipation obscures their ages, but they are most probably in their 50's.'' In John Berry's film adaptation of the play, which will be shown tonight and tomorrow in the New York Film Festival, Boesman and Lena are played by Danny Glover and Angela Bassett, two actors so charismatic that it is shocking to see them so bruised and ragged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berry, a survivor of the Hollywood blacklist who died just as work on the film was being completed, uses the natural luminescence of his stars to emphasize just how cruel the couple's fate has been and also to bring a measure of cinematic life to Mr. Fugard's somewhat wordy allegorical play. In flashbacks -- or as Mr. Berry preferred to call them, ''memory flashes'' -- Mr. Glover looks smooth-faced and content. Ms. Bassett, who spends most of the play huddled in layers of drab, shapeless clothing, recalls an earlier self who was radiant with hope and sexuality. To see the young Boesman and Lena at ease in the garden of their old house or dancing at a neighborhood party is to have a palpable sense of what they have lost.</p>

        <p>A stage direction in Athol Fugard's play ''Boesman and Lena'' says of its main characters, a mixed-race (or ''colored'') couple making their way across the cruel landscape of apartheid-era South Africa, that ''a life of hardship and dissipation obscures their ages, but they are most probably in their 50's.'' In John Berry's film adaptation of the play, which will be shown tonight and tomorrow in the New York Film Festival, Boesman and Lena are played by Danny Glover and Angela Bassett, two actors so charismatic that it is shocking to see them so bruised and ragged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berry, a survivor of the Hollywood blacklist who died just as work on the film was being completed, uses the natural luminescence of his stars to emphasize just how cruel the couple's fate has been and also to bring a measure of cinematic life to Mr. Fugard's somewhat wordy allegorical play. In flashbacks -- or as Mr. Berry preferred to call them, ''memory flashes'' -- Mr. Glover looks smooth-faced and content. Ms. Bassett, who spends most of the play huddled in layers of drab, shapeless clothing, recalls an earlier self who was radiant with hope and sexuality. To see the young Boesman and Lena at ease in the garden of their old house or dancing at a neighborhood party is to have a palpable sense of what they have lost.</p>
        <p>Much of the emotional action of the play -- a series of furious arguments conducted around a shanty built of wire and scrap metal on a desolate mud flat -- involves Lena's desperate attempt to account for her past, to figure out who she is by tracing where she's been. She and Boesman have been uprooted so many times -- most recently by government bulldozers that destroyed their shantytown -- that their store of shared memory seems as minimal and grimly functional as the bundles they carry: a list of place names.</p>
        <p>First performed in 1970, ''Boesman and Lena'' survives after apartheid less as a political statement than as a meditation on the psychology of domination. That Boesman and Lena are oppressed is a given, but Mr. Fugard is more interested in the oppressive dynamic between them -- Boesman's battering rage and Lena's desperate dependency. When a third person shows up -- an ailing black man, with whom they have no common language and whom Boesman derisively refers to by the racist Afrikaans term kaffir -- the bitter logic of their relationship begins to splinter and to become more clear. The ending offers a measured, stoical glimpse of hope.</p>
        <p>Aside from the memory flashes, Mr. Berry's approach to Mr. Fugard's text is careful and conservative. There are occasional stirring glimpses of the mountainous coastline near Cape Town, but the lean-to and campfire might as well be a stage set, and the play's long, gnarled, poetic speeches have been left intact.</p>
        <p>And, happily, placed in the mouths of two extraordinary actors. In his movie roles, Mr. Glover is sometimes gratingly theatrical, but here he finds every nuance of Boesman's pride and frustration as well as his deeply buried, nearly evaporated reservoir of tenderness. And Ms. Bassett stokes Lena's pain to such white heat that the screen fairly burns.</p>
