        <p>Wycliffe Gordon's original score for Oscar Micheaux's ''Body and Soul'' -- as it was performed in a slightly abridged version in a preview performance earlier this week -- is a first long work and a first film score for Mr. Gordon, the brilliant trombonist of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. It sounds like it. Though the band played the piece beautifully, the writing was functional, with some inventive touches that lay within the compositional style of the orchestra's leader, Wynton Marsalis.</p>
        <p>''Body and Soul,'' originally, was sometimes shown with the accompaniment of jazz bands, though of course we don't know how they sounded. Mr. Gordon wrote rather literal-minded music in the idioms that suited a picture about black churchgoers in Georgia of the 1920's: blues -- both city and country -- and hymns. That's Mr. Gordon's element, not just because of his own Southern and religious background, but also because he's been an integral part of a few Wynton Marsalis creations that walked in the same waters, including ''Blood on the Fields'' and ''All Rise.''</p>

        <p>Wycliffe Gordon's original score for Oscar Micheaux's ''Body and Soul'' -- as it was performed in a slightly abridged version in a preview performance earlier this week -- is a first long work and a first film score for Mr. Gordon, the brilliant trombonist of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. It sounds like it. Though the band played the piece beautifully, the writing was functional, with some inventive touches that lay within the compositional style of the orchestra's leader, Wynton Marsalis.</p>
        <p>''Body and Soul,'' originally, was sometimes shown with the accompaniment of jazz bands, though of course we don't know how they sounded. Mr. Gordon wrote rather literal-minded music in the idioms that suited a picture about black churchgoers in Georgia of the 1920's: blues -- both city and country -- and hymns. That's Mr. Gordon's element, not just because of his own Southern and religious background, but also because he's been an integral part of a few Wynton Marsalis creations that walked in the same waters, including ''Blood on the Fields'' and ''All Rise.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon's work with the Lincoln Center Orchestra -- principally some original blues pieces -- hasn't indicated ambitions toward long-form composition, and unsurprisingly the score was a bundle of about half a dozen short, recurring (and rearranged) themes, arising at expected moments. As music alone, it drew some strength from alternating moods; since Micheaux's editing never tires of contrasting good and evil, city and country, barroom and hearth, the music was soft and romantic one minute, hard-bitten and percussive the next -- very much like the collage style that Mr. Marsalis has developed for his longer works.</p>
        <p>Martha Jane is the movie's pure character; she represents home, and her theme is an angelic, reassuring one, with a melody reminiscent of Rodgers and Hart's ''Lover.'' When there's sadness or reflection at home, a more darkly romantic theme crops up, with Ellingtonian voicings.</p>
        <p>Paul Robeson plays both an evil whiskey-preacher and a well-intentioned inventor; a blues cropped up whenever the bad Robeson is seen doing something dastardly. A bar is one of his hangouts, and it provoked a stride-piano theme. It's too bad that not much in the score was made of the good Robeson-bad Robeson duality; then again, there's not much of the good Robeson in the movie.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon used the form of the work-song in two places: a prison flashback in the mind of the Reverend, and then again in an extortion scene during which a title card reads ''Blood Money.''  There, the work song led to a call-and-response vocal arrangement. Mr. Gordon is a decent blues singer with a parched and expressive voice; after his vocal solo, Mr. Marsalis had a turn.</p>
        <p>They sang one-liner blues phrases, some of them cliches: ''ragged as a jaybird,'' ''don't put no sugar in my coffee,'' ''work my nose to the grindstone,'' ''I know my time will come soon.'' And there was gospel music: hymns for reflection, holy-rolling music for Robeson's ''Valley of the Dry Bones'' sermon, where the parishioners rock out and fall apart; then a chaotic, Mingus-esque pile-on of lines when the congregation inevitably turns on the Reverend.</p>
        <p>Every once in a while, Mr. Gordon's score left the impression that he would have liked to write more chatty reactions to the goings-on in the film. (He made the rape scene almost comic: the band collectively gasped when the bad Reverend approached Isabelle, and the trumpets played a victory blast when his shoes are shown walking away from the scene of the crime.) But aside from the vocal arrangements, and some foot-stomping, clapping and harmonica playing when Isabelle takes a train to Atlanta, he mostly stuck to a formulaic use of themes.</p>
        <p>He did, however, rise to the challenge of the film's most stirring scene: when pious Martha Jane is entertaining the possibility that the bad Reverend has raped her daughter. Here, Mr. Gordon played a hymn by himself, followed by one arranged for all the brass; the reeds sounded high alarm tones as Martha Jane's imagination heats up. ''A strange confusion,'' reads one of the title cards, and the music becames mottled and major-minor; Wessell Anderson took an alto saxophone solo that sounded spindly and a little anxious. Shortly, another card reads: ''But of course, it was only the work of the Lord!'' And a restful resolution and decrescendo ensued.</p>
        <p>The score could have used some more original-sounding melodies, and possibly more departures from literal-minded scoring; it certainly served the picture, but left no indication of what Mr. Gordon might be able to do as a long-form composer.</p>
