        <p>After 29 years of deceit, coverup and injustice, the State of New York agreed this year to pay $8 million in damages to inmates who were beaten and abused in reprisals during the recapture of the Attica Correctional Facility in 1971.</p>
        <p>But what about the families of the inmates' hostages who were slain that day by indiscriminate state police gunfire? What about surviving hostages? All the hostages were doing their duty when they were killed, injured or endangered by their employer, New York State.</p>
        <p>Yet, so far, New York has done nothing remotely adequate to compensate these forgotten victims for what one investigatory commission called ''the bloodiest encounter between Americans since the Civil War.'' In some cases, the state has deceived widows and survivors. And no state administration, Republican or Democratic, has admitted responsibility for the uprising at the overcrowded prison, for its poorly planned and brutal repression or for the 43 resulting deaths.</p>
        <p>A brief recap:</p>
        <p>On Sept. 9, 1971, inmates at Attica -- steeped in the general political unrest of the time -- rebelled in reaction to a long history of overcrowding and hard conditions. They took 42 hostages (four were released almost immediately), corrections officers and civilian employees, and held out for nearly five days. One corrections officer was killed in the initial takeover. The inmates then threatened to kill their hostages if attacked.</p>
        <p>They did not kill anybody, though, even when the state police assaulted their stronghold.</p>
        <p>On the orders of Gov. Nelson D. Rockefeller, troopers retook the prison on the morning of Sept. 13, firing into a crowd of about 1,500 inmates. The death toll was 32 inmates and 11 state employees.</p>
        <p>Though prison officials first announced that inmates had killed 10 hostages after castrating some of them, autopsies later disproved this lie: All the dead hostages, none of them castrated, were found to have been killed by gunfire -- mostly from the state police, some from corrections officers.</p>
        <p>Years of coverup ensued, with the state's primary effort directed at indicting inmates only. No state police and no corrections officers known to have taken reprisals against the inmates were charged. In 1976, Gov. Hugh Carey issued a blanket pardon for everyone involved and sealed the state's records concerning Attica for 50 years.</p>
        <p>Shortly after Attica was retaken, state officials urged the families of slain and surviving hostages to accept certain limited death benefits -- for example, $347.62 a month for a widow with four children. Surviving hostages were asked to take paid leave. But they didn't know that this pay included workers' compensation funds, which, once accepted, barred them from suing the state.</p>
        <p>The difference, when it comes to compensation, can be significant: One of the widows, Mrs. Herbert Jones, rejected the benefit, sued the state and was awarded $1 million for her husband's death.</p>
        <p>In January 2000, 29 years after the assault, New York finally agreed to a $12 million settlement -- $8 million for 1,280 inmates who claimed to have been beaten in reprisals, $4 million for their lawyers. The state still admitted no wrongdoing or responsibility.</p>
        <p>This settlement with the inmates aggrieved surviving hostages and families of state employees who died. None had received a penny.</p>
        <p>To redress their grievances, they formed Forgotten Victims of Attica and are now hoping to persuade the New York legislature and Governor Pataki of the justice of their cause and of their demands: acceptance of responsibility by the state, psychological counseling for widows and survivors, an annual commemorative ceremony at the prison, access to the sealed records of the uprising and some financial compensation.</p>
        <p>Legislators have approved a total payment of $550,000 -- a mere $50,000 for each of the 11 dead state employees. The victims' group has rejected this, urging the state to follow the precedent set in Mrs. Jones's suit -- $1 million for the families of each hostage killed and for each of the surviving hostages.</p>
        <p>The public, said Michael Smith, a surviving hostage recently interviewed by the Batavia, N.Y., Daily News, ''has the misconception that we were taken care of. That never happened.''</p>
        <p>Indeed it did not; quite the opposite. After 29 years, it's time to remember these forgotten victims and to make the public aware of the whole truth about the Attica uprising, its aftermath and the state's callous response.</p>
