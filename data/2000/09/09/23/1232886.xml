        <p>More details were made public today from the videotaped confession of a former aide to President Jacques Chirac, who described how he collected kickbacks from contractors installing elevators and painting hallways in city housing projects.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac, who is accused on the tape of masterminding a multimillion-dollar slush fund in the 1980's, issued a vehement denial on Thursday, suggesting that the release of the tape made by the aide, who died last year, was the work of his political enemies.</p>
        <p>But he ignored the matter today as the daily Le Monde ran another two pages of transcript from the aide's detailed account of how he collected millions of dollars in kickbacks.</p>
        <p>The aide, Jean-Claude Mery, a former official in Mr. Chirac's party, discusses how he helped companies win construction contracts, and in return usually got about 1.5 percent of the job's value. ''The sums were staggering,'' the transcript in Le Monde reads. ''I transferred more than $1 million in less than a year to certain banks in Switzerland.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mery said the money had gone only to further Mr. Chirac's political ambitions and that of his allies in the party, the Rally for the Republic, and had not been for Mr. Chirac's personal use. ''I tell you we were working for Chirac's benefit,'' Mr. Mery says on the tape. ''Not for Chirac's pocket personally, let me make that clear right away.''</p>
        <p>The French Socialists called on the judicial system today to get to the bottom of the allegations, but their remarks were low-key. On the tape, Mr. Mery says that kickbacks the party collected were shared with the Socialist and Communist parties, though Mr. Chirac's party kept by far the biggest cut.</p>
        <p>The tape surfaced Thursday when the newspaper ran the first two pages of transcript. It reported that the tape had been recorded in 1996, when Mr. Mery was under investigation for illicit fund-raising.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mery, a developer and a member of the party's steering committee, says on the tape he is recording his confessions because unspecified promises made to him have been ignored. He says friends have told him to make the tape and spread the word that it exists. He says he hopes that it will guarantee his safety.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac, who has been dogged for years by hints of corruption during his terms as mayor and as leader of his conservative Gaullist party, took the highly unusual step of going on television on Thursday night to dismiss Mr. Mery's accusations as a ''fantastic story.'' He said the tape amounted to no more than producing ''a man who had been dead more than a year, laying out implausible events that supposedly happened more than 14 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Today, without discussing the tapes, he made his scheduled appearance in the southwest of France and campaigned in favor of a referendum on Sunday to reduce the term of the French president to five years from seven.</p>
        <p>As long as Mr. Chirac is president,  he cannot be prosecuted for anything other than high treason.</p>
