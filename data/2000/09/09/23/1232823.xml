        <p>Those who say that ''there is nothing new under the sun'' are clearly wrong, in both the microcosm of the bridge world and the wider world. In the diagramed deal, consider the North-South diamonds, which declarer is aiming to establish in a four-spade contract.</p>
        <p>If you cash the ace and king, and both opponents follow, does it matter which card you lead next from dummy? Surprisingly, it might. If, as here, West follows with two honors, leaving one honor outstanding, the next play is significant.</p>

        <p>Those who say that ''there is nothing new under the sun'' are clearly wrong, in both the microcosm of the bridge world and the wider world. In the diagramed deal, consider the North-South diamonds, which declarer is aiming to establish in a four-spade contract.</p>
        <p>If you cash the ace and king, and both opponents follow, does it matter which card you lead next from dummy? Surprisingly, it might. If, as here, West follows with two honors, leaving one honor outstanding, the next play is significant.</p>
        <p>The deal occurred in the final of the New York Grand National Teams in May, and the cosmopolitan Pakistani star, Zia Mahmood, held the South cards. He reached his aggressive four-spade contract after West had intervened with a take-out double promising hearts and clubs. North's redouble announced three-card spade support.</p>
        <p>The opening lead of the club king was allowed to win, and West continued with the ten. South won and took the ace and king of diamonds, noting the appearance of the jack and queen on his left. Was that, he wondered, an honest doubleton?</p>
        <p>He carefully led the diamond nine from the dummy and noted that East played the seven. If East had held the 10-7, it was inconceivable that he would fail to cover with the ten. Therefore South could ruff low without any danger of an overruff.</p>
        <p>But if South had called for a low card from the dummy, the play of the seven from East would have given him no information at all about the location of the ten. South might still have ruffed low, but it would have been less clear.</p>
        <p>It now seemed likely to South that there was a singleton spade on his left. His next move was to play a spade to dummy's ace. Then he led a diamond winner, and East ruffed with the jack. This was a small error that proved to give away an overtrick; he should have pitched the club jack. South overruffed, cashed the club ace, ruffed a club, and threw his last club on the final diamond winner.</p>
        <p>Zia had made 11 tricks by fine play that included a new use for the diamond nine, and his team gained 11 imps. In the replay North-South were content to play in two spades and made nine tricks.</p>
