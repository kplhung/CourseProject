        <p>Retrieved White House e-mail messages turned over today to federal and Congressional investigators show that Vice President Al Gore's senior aides routinely characterized White House coffee sessions as fund-raising events in early 1996.</p>
        <p>While none of the e-mail messages indicate that the vice president himself was involved in any of the electronic conversations, the aides' descriptions of the coffees seem to be at odds with Mr. Gore's comments in an April 18 interview this year with federal investigators. The vice president said the 103 coffee gatherings with campaign donors held at the White House before the 1996 election had not been ''fund-raising tools.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's remarks in the four-hour interview led a senior Justice Department prosecutor, Robert J. Conrad Jr., to recommend that Attorney General Janet Reno appoint a special counsel to investigate the truthfulness of Mr. Gore's remarks. Last month, Ms. Reno declined to appoint a special counsel.</p>
        <p>The e-mail messages had been subpoenaed by a Congressional committee and the Justice Department investigating allegations of campaign finance abuses and other matters in the Clinton administration. Their release today came after months of complaining by members of Congress that the White House was trying to withhold them.</p>
        <p>Republicans quickly seized on the contents as evidence that the vice president and the White House had not been truthful in earlier explanations of the purpose of the coffees and an event at a Buddhist Temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif., before the 1996 election. And the committee chairman, Representative Dan Burton of Indiana, said he would made hold hearings on the newly released correspondence next week.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign countered that the e-mail messages were consistent with earlier explanations of the nature of the coffees and contained nothing new.</p>
        <p>Karen Skelton, Mr. Gore's political director, asked an aide to the vice president in an e-mail note dated April 23, 1996: ''These are F.R. coffees, right?'' Asked tonight whether the abbreviation stood for fund-raising, a White House aide said it could also mean ''finance-related,'' a phrase the vice president himself once used to describe his appearance at a luncheon at a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles in April 1996.</p>
        <p>On May 8, 1996, Ms. Skelton described in an e-mail message the expectations that the White House had for people invited to coffees with President Clinton and Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' Ms. Skelton wrote to an aide, ''but keep in mind that these people must be justifiable on the basis of what they give us down the line. What is the consequence of our meeting with one person other than that person feeling good?''</p>
        <p>The e-mail messages released by the White House are among a cache of nearly 150,000 messages that the White House failed to properly archive from 1996 to 1998.</p>
        <p>Congressional Republicans have criticized White House officials for failing to immediately inform them that they could not retrieve the messages, a problem the White House attributed to a computer glitch in June 1998.</p>
        <p>The problem was not revealed to Congressional committees investigating the issue until early this year. Since April, technicians have methodically retrieved the lost e-mail correspondence from a computer database.</p>
        <p>Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said tonight that the e-mail messages contain information that had already been provided three years earlier to several Congressional investigative committees, including the House panel led by Representative Burton. ''There is nothing significant here in response to Dan Burton's 25 subpoenas,'' Mr. Kennedy said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy said that in the April interview with federal investigators, the vice president acknowledged that White House coffee guests were often solicited to contribute to the Democratic Party after attending one of the events.</p>
        <p>''The vice president testified seven times in April that attendees would likely be asked at a later date to financially support the D.N.C., and that is completely consistent with these e-mails,'' Mr. Kennedy said tonight. ''There is nothing in any of this material that sheds any new light on old arguments, all of which have been fully investigated for years now.''</p>
        <p>Karen P. Hughes, the communications director for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, said the e-mail notes are ''another piece of evidence that calls into question the vice president's credibility when he says he did not know that a fund-raising event was a fund-raising event.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Burton tonight vowed to make the newly released e-mail messages an issue at a hearing scheduled for Tuesday. When Ms. Reno decided not to seek the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Mr. Gore, she said, ''I have concluded that there is no reasonable possibility that further investigation could develop evidence that would support the filing of charges for making a willful false statement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burton said: ''At the time the attorney general made this statement, did she have these e-mails? Many of them come from the vice president's office and deal directly with the White House fund-raising coffees and the Hsi Lai Temple fund-raiser.''</p>
        <p>The White House first released the documents this afternoon to The Associated Press, not long after White House aides released a lengthy list of recent overnight guests at the White House and Camp David. In 1997, the White House routinely released campaign documents late on Friday afternoon so it would be published in Saturday newspapers when readership is often thought to be lightest. Aides refused to say whether the simultaneous release of the material was intended to minimize its impact.</p>
        <p>Some messages deal with Mr. Gore's attendance of the luncheon at the Hsi Lai Temple. But many of those notes are excerpts of memorandums that had been previously turned over to Congressional investigators and made public. Several e-mail messages again demonstrate that Gore aides may have been confused about two fund-raisers that had been originally scheduled.</p>
        <p>''Currently, we are committed in San Jose and L.A. for fund-raising events,'' one staff e-mail note said about the trip.</p>
        <p>But the schedule for Mr. Gore prepared nearly three weeks before the temple luncheon did not mention a fund-raising event at a Los Angeles area restaurant. After arriving in Los Angeles at 11 a.m., Mr. Gore was scheduled to proceed to the Hsi Lai Temple event, which was described at the time as a Democratic National Committee ''Asian Pacific American Leadership Council Luncheon.''</p>
        <p>Another e-mail note recommended that Mr. Gore bring $20 with him to the temple so he could make a donation of his own. ''The V.P. will need to have some cash on hand,'' a message said, ''to offer as an offering at the Buddhist temple in L.A.''</p>
        <p>James C. Wilson, the chief counsel of the House Committee on Government Reform, said tonight that he was ''particularly frustrated'' by the cache of e-mail messages that the committee received this afternoon.</p>
        <p>''There is new information and new leads that need to be investigated,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''The White House covered this up for over three years and that is simply not acceptable.''</p>
