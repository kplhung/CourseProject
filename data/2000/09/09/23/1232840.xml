        <p>A stock-fraud defendant charged with plotting to kill the judge assigned to his fraud case will be tried before another judge.</p>
        <p>The fraud prosecution of the defendant, Stuart Winkler, will be severed from those of the other defendants in the case in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, according to a ruling yesterday by Justice Leslie Crocker Snyder, the judge Mr. Winkler is accused of threatening.</p>
        <p>''The appearance of impropriety could exist'' if she heard his case, Justice Snyder said, ''not only because the defendant allegedly wished to bump me off but because the publicity was startling and overwhelming.'' The publicity was the main reason for what the judge called an exceptional ruling, because she was reluctant to reward what she called ''the ultimate in judge-shopping.''</p>
        <p>The securities case, in which 33 people were indicted more than a year ago, involved A. S. Goldmen, a Florida-based firm. Mr. Winkler, 47, of Morganville, N.J., was its chief financial officer. Last month, he was indicted on charges of conspiracy and criminal solicitation. Investigators said he hired a fellow prisoner at the Manhattan Detention Complex to kill Justice Snyder, who has raised his bail to $1 million in cash. That case is assigned to a different judge.</p>
