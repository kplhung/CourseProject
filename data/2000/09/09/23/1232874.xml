        <p>Scott Layden is viewed throughout the National Basketball Association as an honest and straightforward general manager who rarely, if ever, misleads.

        <p>It is hard for basketball people to believe that the four-team, 12-player trade in which the Knicks received Glen Rice, Luc Longley, Travis Knight, three marginal players and four draft picks for Patrick Ewing, who went to Seattle, and Chris Dudley, who went to Phoenix with a draft pick, is the final move of the off-season for the Knicks.</p>

        <p>Scott Layden is viewed throughout the National Basketball Association as an honest and straightforward general manager who rarely, if ever, misleads. Even so, few executives around the league believed him Thursday when he said that the Knicks would not make another trade before the start of training camp on Oct. 3.</p>
        <p>It is hard for basketball people to believe that the four-team, 12-player trade in which the Knicks received Glen Rice, Luc Longley, Travis Knight, three marginal players and four draft picks for Patrick Ewing, who went to Seattle, and Chris Dudley, who went to Phoenix with a draft pick, is the final move of the off-season for the Knicks.</p>
        <p>That sentiment stems not only from the Knicks' now lopsided roster, but also from the high number of draft picks they took on and from their addition of three long-term contracts (Rice, Longley, Knight), which will greatly increase their luxury tax after next season.</p>
        <p>Several league officials said that the Knicks were after Chris Webber of the Sacramento Kings or Dikembe Mutombo of the Atlanta Hawks. Hardly anyone believes that the Knicks can get Webber, but Mutombo is not perceived to be as much of a stretch. According to an official with an Eastern Conference team who requested anonymity, the Knicks spoke with Atlanta yesterday and offered Marcus Camby, Chris Childs and either Allan Houston or Latrell Sprewell for Mutombo and Jim Jackson.</p>
        <p>Neither Layden nor Pete Babcock, the Hawks' general manager, could be reached for comment, but Babcock has given no indication in recent days that he is on the verge of dealing with the Knicks.</p>
        <p>Mutombo, one of the league's premier rebounders and shot blockers, is on the wish list of many N.B.A. teams, and the Hawks may be able to get more for him than the Knicks can offer. Portland and Phoenix are among the teams said to be interested in acquiring the All-Star center.</p>
        <p>''I think the Knicks have a lot of chips now,'' an Eastern Conference official said. ''They've got two No. 1 picks and three great scorers, so if they're interested in pulling something off, I think they can. Whether they can get Mutombo is another question. He clearly is the second-best center in the East, so the Hawks will be fielding all kinds of offers for him.''</p>
        <p>There are potential downsides surrounding every player the Knicks could trade.</p>
        <p>Houston can opt out of his contract after next season, so few teams, especially non-playoff clubs like Atlanta, will trade for him, knowing that he could walk away after one year. Camby has great ability and potential, but his durability is a question. He has never played more than 63 games in a season and is coming off a knee injury. He also lacks a competent go-to move on offense, which further decreases his marketability.</p>
        <p>Sprewell is generally regarded as the Knicks' best all-around player, but Atlanta may shy away from him because of the problems he had playing for a losing team when he was with the Golden State Warriors. He has been fine in New York where he has been winning, but the Hawks may wonder how he would handle being in a rebuilding situation.</p>
        <p>It is possible that the Knicks may not have enough, in Atlanta's eyes, to get Mutombo; it might take another three- or four-team trade to get him to New York. The clubs spoke last week about a four-team trade that would have included Ewing and sent Mutombo to New York, but the Hawks declined.</p>
        <p>Some people close to David Falk, the powerful agent who represents Rice, Ewing and Mutombo, insisted that he was pressuring Atlanta to trade Mutombo, but Babcock said no such thing had occurred. In fact, Babcock said Falk had given him every indication that Mutombo, who has worked out at the Hawks' practice facility for much of the summer, is willing to finish his career in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Even if Mutombo wanted to leave Atlanta as a free agent after the season, he would probably have to work with the Hawks to get a sign-and-trade deal because few contending teams will have enough salary-cap room to give him the maximum-level contract he will seek. And, in what is the worst-case scenario for the Hawks: if Mutombo leaves Atlanta as a free agent, the team would be $22 million under the salary cap and have a chance to sign two, maybe three, top free agents, including Webber and Dallas's Michael Finley.</p>
        <p>''Atlanta holds all the cards,'' one general manager said. ''They don't have to do anything. New York has no leverage with them.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks covet Webber even more than Mutombo, and those close to the Kings' forward say he would love to play in New York. Webber may want to play for the Knicks and alongside his buddy Sprewell, but Mutombo is not likely to end up at Madison Square Garden, especially before or during this season. There is little reason for Sacramento, which hopes it will be able to re-sign Webber, to trade its top player just yet.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Kings are likely to start the season with Webber. If they become convinced that he will go elsewhere, the Kings would probably field offers for him before the trading deadline in February or wait until after the season and work out a sign-and-trade deal. If and when the Kings call, the Knicks would be more than willing to deal.</p>
