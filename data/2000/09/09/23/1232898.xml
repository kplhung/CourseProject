        <p>Editorial on White House's newly-released list of overnight guests since July; reminds Hillary Clinton that using invitations to Lincoln Bedroom as fund-raising bait is just the kind of outdated practice she needs to shed as she grows to political independence</p>

        <p>Just when Hillary Rodham Clinton has been making headway among voters in New York, her campaign for Senate has hit a familiar political problem. Yesterday the White House released a list of more guests who have stayed overnight there or at Camp David since July. About a quarter of them have contributed to Mrs. Clinton's campaign. At the same time, the first lady's proposal to Representative Rick Lazio that both candidates forgo all broadcast ads paid for with unregulated soft money was rejected by Mr. Lazio on the grounds that it was one-sided. The collection of soft money, of course, is at the center of the reckless fund-raising system that has led to excesses like the White House sleepovers.</p>
        <p>The Clintons' use of the White House to reward contributors was a national embarrassment, but the  sleepovers themselves were never proved to be illegal. That probably continues to be the case, but the use of invitations to the Lincoln Bedroom as fund-raising bait is just the kind of outdated practice that Mrs. Clinton needs to shed as she grows to political independence. Mr. Lazio is justified in making this distasteful practice an issue in his campaign.</p>

        <p>Just when Hillary Rodham Clinton has been making headway among voters in New York, her campaign for Senate has hit a familiar political problem. Yesterday the White House released a list of more guests who have stayed overnight there or at Camp David since July. About a quarter of them have contributed to Mrs. Clinton's campaign. At the same time, the first lady's proposal to Representative Rick Lazio that both candidates forgo all broadcast ads paid for with unregulated soft money was rejected by Mr. Lazio on the grounds that it was one-sided. The collection of soft money, of course, is at the center of the reckless fund-raising system that has led to excesses like the White House sleepovers.</p>
        <p>The Clintons' use of the White House to reward contributors was a national embarrassment, but the  sleepovers themselves were never proved to be illegal. That probably continues to be the case, but the use of invitations to the Lincoln Bedroom as fund-raising bait is just the kind of outdated practice that Mrs. Clinton needs to shed as she grows to political independence. Mr. Lazio is justified in making this distasteful practice an issue in his campaign.</p>
        <p>A possible mutual agreement to ban soft money unraveled yesterday when it turned out that Mrs. Clinton's proposal would have called on Mr. Lazio to bar ads sponsored by groups outside his campaign but allow supporters of Mrs. Clinton's candidacy -- particularly the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Sierra Club and the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League -- to run ads paid for by unrestricted donations. The first lady argued that her proposal was more of a sacrifice for her campaign than it would be for Mr. Lazio. Her aides also asserted that the outside groups paying for ads for Mr. Lazio were sham organizations set up by the Republican Party, whereas Mrs. Clinton's groups were legitimate organizations with large numbers of members.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton's contention is not supportable. A soft-money ban should apply equally to both campaigns. She could easily get these well-known groups to forgo their televised ad campaigns.</p>
        <p>Although discussions between Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton collapsed into recriminations last night, there is still time for them to try to work something out that would be of mutual benefit and would also serve the public interest. A deal to ban soft money would also enhance Mrs. Clinton's image. The one thing that has marred her increasingly effective race is fund-raising.</p>
        <p>In 1996 President Clinton twisted the limits on the use of soft money, which should never have been used for campaign ads, in a way that has damaged and corrupted the political system. Using the White House and Camp David for sleepovers has tarred the presidency and cheapened institutions that should be above political advantage. Mrs. Clinton can go far to separate herself from these abuses if she can accept a fair deal on soft money.</p>
