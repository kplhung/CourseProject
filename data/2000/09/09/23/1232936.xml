        <p>NO. 10 MICHIGAN 2-1 at  NO. 19 ILLINOIS 3-0</p>
        <p>Michigan gets the edge if it finds its scoring punch. It rushed for 263 yards against U.C.L.A. last Saturday and still lost, partly because John Navarre, its new quarterback, couldn't find his receivers. Kurt Kittner, the Illinois quarterback, is slowed by a sprained knee.TV: ESPN, 7:30 P.M.</p>

        <p>NO. 10 MICHIGAN 2-1 at  NO. 19 ILLINOIS 3-0</p>
        <p>Michigan gets the edge if it finds its scoring punch. It rushed for 263 yards against U.C.L.A. last Saturday and still lost, partly because John Navarre, its new quarterback, couldn't find his receivers. Kurt Kittner, the Illinois quarterback, is slowed by a sprained knee.TV: ESPN, 7:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>NO. 16 NOTRE DAME 2-1 at  NO. 23 MICHIGAN STATE 2-0</p>
        <p>While Michigan State struggled to beat Missouri, Notre Dame upset Purdue on a field goal as time expired. Gary Godsey, in his debut as the Irish quarterback, showed enough poise. But consider this: Michigan State has won eight straight at home. Notre Dame has lost six straight on the road.TV: CH7, 3:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>NO. 6 U.C.L.A. 3-0 at  OREGON 2-1</p>
        <p>Never mind that U.C.L.A. upset Alabama and Michigan when both were ranked No. 3 nationally. Oregon is favored, partly because it has won 16 in a row at home. Oregon can pass, and U.C.L.A.'s best defensive lineman, Kenyon Coleman, is injured.</p>
        <p>OTHER GAMES</p>
        <p>EAST</p>
        <p>No. 12 Miami (1-1)  at West Virginia (2-0)</p>
        <p>Miami must be wary. Its offense has already fumbled eight times and its defense has yielded 760 yards.  TV: CBS, 3:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>Rutgers (2-1)  at Pittsburgh (3-0)</p>
        <p>Virginia Tech ended Rutgers's two-game resurrection, and Pitt should pose more problems. Rutgers expects quarterback Mike McMahon (strained throwing shoulder) to be ready.</p>
        <p>Memphis (2-1)  at Army (0-3)</p>
        <p>Memphis ranks seventh in the nation in defense, 106th in offense.</p>
        <p>Yale (1-0)  at Cornell (0-1)</p>
        <p>Cornell seems unlikely to stop Rashad Bartholomew's running.</p>
        <p>Lehigh (2-0)  at Princeton (0-1)</p>
        <p>Lehigh could win big despite a generous defense.</p>
        <p>Columbia (1-0)  at Bucknell (1-1)</p>
        <p>The difference is Jabu Powell of Bucknell, who rushed for 282 yards against Cornell.</p>
        <p>SOUTH</p>
        <p>Kentucky (2-1)  at No. 3 Florida (3-0)</p>
        <p>Two big passing teams. But hardly anyone can outpass Florida.</p>
        <p>No. 11 Clemson (3-0)  at Virginia (2-1)</p>
        <p>Clemson's ground game (346 yards against Wake Forest) is too good.</p>
        <p>Northern Illinois (1-1)  at No. 20 Auburn (3-0)</p>
        <p>Auburn can win with Rudi Johnson's running or Ben Leard's passing.</p>
        <p>Syracuse (1-1)  at East Carolina (2-1)</p>
        <p>East Carolina's long passing game will test Syracuse's shuffled secondary.  TV: ESPN2, Noon</p>
        <p>MIDWEST</p>
        <p>Penn State (1-3)  at No. 14 Ohio State (3-0)</p>
        <p>Despite Penn State's worst start in 17 years, Coach Joe Paterno said, ''I am excited that I think I have a pretty good football team that is eventually going to be a darn good football team.''  TV: ABC, Noon</p>
        <p>Northwestern (2-1)  at No. 7 Wisconsin (3-0)</p>
        <p>Wisconsin has won 11 in a row, but this year's victories have been scary.</p>
        <p>Minnesota (2-1)  at No. 21 Purdue (2-1)</p>
        <p>Purdue should win if it stops making mistakes.  TV: ESPN, Noon</p>
        <p>SOUTHWEST</p>
        <p>Houston (1-2)  at No. 15 Texas (1-1)</p>
        <p>Texas, with an offensive line averaging 315 pounds a man, is unsteady running the ball.</p>
        <p>Rice (1-2)  at No. 17 Oklahoma (2-0)</p>
        <p>Coach Joe Hollis of Arkansas State, Oklahoma's latest victim, said, ''I think they'll be tested when they play against a better football team.'' Not today.</p>
        <p>Arkansas State (0-3)  at No. 18 Texas Christian (2-0)</p>
        <p>Texas Christian, with a big running game, has won seven straight.</p>
        <p>FAR WEST</p>
        <p>San Jose State (2-1)  at No. 9 Southern Cal (2-0)</p>
        <p>San Jose State, which has beaten Stanford, seems over its head here.</p>
        <p>MISMATCHES</p>
        <p>Iowa (0-3)  at No. 1 Nebraska (2-0)</p>
        <p>Nebraska's only problem is stopping kickoff and punt returns.</p>
        <p>Louisville (2-0)  at No. 2 Florida State (3-0)</p>
        <p>Chris Weinke of Florida State has become a first-rate passer.  TV: ESPN2, 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>North Texas (0-3)  at No. 4 Kansas State (3-0)</p>
        <p>Kansas State, the nation's eighth-ranked offense, should be able to run at will.</p>
        <p>Louisiana-Monroe (1-2)  at No. 13 Tennessee (1-1)</p>
        <p>Tennessee won't have to worry about Florida's passing this time.</p>
        <p>Rankings by The Associated Press. All times are Eastern.</p>
