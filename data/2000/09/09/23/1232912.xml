        <p>For 35 mostly successful seasons, the mountains of Central Pennsylvania seemed to surround and protect Joe Paterno's football program like so many big blockers forming a pass pocket. But this year, Paterno's team may be standing on a precipice.</p>
        <p>On Saturday in a Big Ten season opener, the Nittany Lions visit Ohio State, bringing with them a 1-3 record, the worst start by a Paterno team since 1983.</p>
        <p>The Buckeyes, the first of Penn State's eight conference opponents, have a 3-0 record and have defeated the Lions in three of their last five meetings, including the last three at Ohio Stadium.</p>
        <p>Paterno's history of success and his reservoir of good will blend well with a reputation as an intellectual with a pleasant manner. Because of this, the discussion about him in this quaintly named town is neither as passionate nor as polarized as it was in Indiana regarding Bobby Knight, Paterno's friend, who was recently dismissed as the Hoosiers' basketball coach.</p>
        <p>Knight was not winning as much as he used to, and neither is Paterno, whose team has lost six of its last seven regular-season games. Nevertheless, the mood on the Penn State campus seems calm, with the students almost as sanguine as the coach they call JoePa.</p>
        <p>Brad Long and Matt Drew, two business majors who had just finished an exam in management information systems, reflected this attitude while walking along College Avenue this week.</p>
        <p>''You've got JoePa and he's a legend, so you've got faith in JoePa,'' said Long, a junior from Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Drew, a sophomore from Voorhees, N.J., said: ''The freshmen might say something like 'JoePa needs to go' because they don't know anything. If you've been here a couple years, you know enough to let him do his thing. Penn State football probably gets a lot more critiques from outside sources than they do internally.''</p>
        <p>A few blocks away, in front of the South Residence Halls, two juniors, JoAnna Hughes of York, Pa., and Laura Costantini, of Norristown, Pa., were working at a voter registration table. They had a slightly different take.</p>
        <p>''I'm kind of disappointed in how the campus is reacting,'' Costantini said. ''I think it is disrespectful to Joe Paterno at the games when students start booing. People leave early. The stands empty out.''</p>
        <p>Hughes offered a technical analysis.</p>
        <p>''They need consistency in the quarterback position,'' she said, referring to Rashard Casey. ''I don't think any of the opposing defenses can possibly respect our offensive squad, because we're so mediocre. Some people are questioning the fact that other teams are able to predict the plays. However, I really don't know if that's a valid criticism.''</p>
        <p>One of the critics of the offense is a Penn State player, running back Larry Johnson. After a 24-6 loss to Toledo three weeks ago, Johnson said: ''Everything we do is too predictable. Everybody knows what we are doing. The system has been around too long. We've got coaches who have been here for 30, 20 years. It seems like things never change.''</p>
        <p>What made the remarks especially stinging was that Johnson's father, Larry Johnson Sr., is an assistant on Paterno's staff.</p>
        <p>After a 12-0 defeat at Pittsburgh last Saturday, Johnson the player spoke with the news media for the first time in two weeks. His father, who coaches the defensive line, stood next to him, monitoring the conversation.</p>
        <p>''I learned my lesson,'' the son said. ''I spoke out of turn. I should have said it to the team, not out in the open to the media.''</p>
        <p>Johnson and the rest of the players met Monday, without the coaches. Casey, the starting quarterback, said afterward: ''Somebody's got to say something to wake this team up. I'm the one running around like a chicken with my head cut off.''</p>
        <p>Eddie Drummond, a split end, said there had been times when ''I looked into players' eyes and it didn't seem like they were having any fun. They were too uptight.''</p>
        <p>Mike Cerimele, the fullback, said after a season-opening 29-5 loss to Southern California that ''we all started to panic.''</p>
        <p>''Everything has been so negative,'' Cerimele said. ''Our problem is mental. We are killing ourselves. We're getting pushed around, because we don't know what we're doing.''</p>
        <p>Jimmy Kennedy, a defensive tackle, said: ''Our pride is hurting. Once things go wrong, as a team, maybe you have some guys going in the tank and maybe not. I'm not sure.''</p>
        <p>At many schools, such comments would suggest a problem with the coaching staff. Paterno needs five victories to tie Bear Bryant's career mark of 323, the most ever in Division I-A. He may need a 6-2 conference record to get a postseason bowl bid. With Paterno approaching his 74th birthday, in his 51st season in the business, it is reasonable to wonder whether he has overstayed. Tim Curley, the athletic director, answered that question emphatically in the negative.</p>
        <p>''From where I sit, it doesn't enter into it,'' Curley said. ''The good news is we haven't experienced this much in the past. From my end of it, the campus is not panicking.''</p>
        <p>Curley sits at the edge of campus in an office at the Bryce Jordan Center, Penn State's new basketball arena. Across the street, even during the football season, construction cranes and hard-hatted workers are renovating Beaver Stadium, a $93 million project that will expand seating capacity from 96,000 to 105,500. Commercials on Paterno's radio show this week urged fans to sign up for club seats in the new sections that could be willed to children and grandchildren.</p>
        <p>The team plays six home games each year, with each game generating about $3 million from tickets, parking and concessions. The economic waves lap up on many shores. Ron Agostinelli, the general manager of McLanahan's Student Store, stood in the Penn State Room in the back, surrounded by blue and white team shirts, golf balls, football jerseys and other souvenirs.</p>
        <p>''There's definitely a drop in sales when the team is losing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Down the street, in the Corner Room restaurant, Liz Pierce, a manager, said the entire town reflected the team's downbeat fortunes.</p>
        <p>''The whole aura changes; it's a much more subdued atmosphere,'' she said. ''People get fairly morose.''</p>
        <p>Pierce said she knew the mood of the fans regarding the coach.</p>
        <p>''From Joe Paterno, they don't demand,'' she said. ''Nobody does.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps this respect helps keep the coach's mood chipper. Paterno declined to be interviewed for this article, but he spoke on a conference call Tuesday and appeared on his own radio show on Thursday night over a local station.</p>
        <p>After the Pittsburgh game, Paterno second-guessed himself over his use of Casey. Paterno said he should not have pulled Casey for a series of downs against Pittsburgh, although he still seemed uncertain about Casey's ability to lead the team.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Paterno said, ''Our problem is not necessarily Casey.'' He said that his young team would improve, while warning, ''We may not be good enough to beat anybody on our schedule.''</p>
        <p>He joked that the Lions had lost every coin toss so far and he told reporters on the conference call, ''You guys all think I am about ready to shoot myself.''</p>
        <p>Paterno insisted that he still thought coaching was fun and said he was ''excited'' about the rest of the season. He added, though, that ''I work harder at coaching today than I have ever worked in my life.''</p>
        <p>When he took calls on the radio Thursday, some fans prefaced their comments by saying it was an honor to talk to him. But they also offered pointed criticisms of Casey's movement in the pass pocket and of Paterno's use of personnel on the offensive line and of his choice of running backs.</p>
        <p>Instead of getting defensive, Paterno told one caller: ''Well, John, you've probably got something there. I kind of agree with you.''</p>
        <p>And the coach said to another caller: ''Your question is insightful. We did make that move and it's debatable whether we made the right one.''</p>
        <p>But when a caller suggested that people in Pittsburgh perceived that the Panthers were on the way up and the Nittany Lions were on the way down, Paterno said, ''You can tell those guys in Pittsburgh, we're not about to pass out into the sunset on the back of a mule.''</p>
        <p>The Lions' poor start has not upset him, the veteran coach told another caller.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult for me to get too uptight,'' he said. ''I've coached a lot of football games. Maybe I'm philosophical.''</p>
