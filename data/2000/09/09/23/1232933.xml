        <p>A 16-year-old student at Samuel Gompers High School in the Bronx whose medical condition was apparently ignored by school nurses died yesterday morning after collapsing while climbing stairs, Board of Education officials said.</p>
        <p>Despite a school health record indicating that he was not to participate in any vigorous physical activity, the student, Dantese Jenkins, was assigned to physical education class last spring and was on his way to the gymnasium yesterday when he collapsed, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said in a statement yesterday.</p>
        <p>The boy's mother, Kim Jackson, said she had given his medical records to the school with a letter from a doctor stating that Dantese should not be involved in strenuous activities, including stair climbing.</p>
        <p>''I blame the school,'' Ms. Jackson said. ''They didn't look over their medical records properly. If they did, my son would still be here.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jackson said that her son's heart problem, called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was diagnosed when he was 10 and that his father, Harold Williams, died of the same condition at age 28. She added that although she told her son not to engage in any sports, he might have participated without telling her.</p>
        <p>Detective Edward Reuss, a police spokesman, said the authorities were investigating the matter. He said the school notified the police of an emergency around 8:20 a.m. yesterday.</p>
        <p>No school health officials had reported any restrictions on the student's activities at the school either last year or this year, Mr. Levy said. Dantese, a junior, was in his second year at the school, which serves students in the 10th through 12th grades.</p>
        <p>''It is apparent that the child should not have been allowed to engage in any active physical conduct,'' Mr. Levy said. He instructed Norman Wechsler, the superintendent for Bronx high schools, to investigate the matter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said that the health office at Gompers High School had been in disarray for more than a year. Two successive school nurses were removed for unsatisfactory performance last year and a third served until the end of the school year but did not return. She has not been replaced. Those nurses would have been responsible for reviewing the health records of each new student, Mr. Levy said.</p>
        <p>''No one assigned to the medical room at Gompers appears to have reported any health restrictions for this child,'' Mr. Levy said. ''The child's record also contains a written request for a medical transfer to another school. It appears no action was taken on this request.''</p>
        <p>The reason for the transfer request was not clear in the records, and no letter from a doctor was in the file, officials said. But they added that the presence of the medical transfer request form in the file indicates that such a letter had probably been received.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said it was not clear why no action had been taken. ''I sincerely wish this tragedy had been avoided,'' he said. ''I have expressed my great sorrow to the family.''</p>
        <p>Nydia Negron-Rios, a spokeswoman for Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, said Dantese was dead on arrival at the hospital. An official at the medical examiner's office said the cause of death had not yet been determined, although the police said the boy probably had had a heart attack.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jackson said she planned to hire a lawyer and would go to the school on Monday to speak to the students who were in the gym at the time.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 24, 2000, Sunday  An article yesterday about the death of a Bronx high school student who had a heart ailment referred incorrectly in some editions to the semester in which Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said the boy was wrongly assigned to a physical education class. It was last spring, not this fall.</p>
