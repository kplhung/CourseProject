        <p>Parts of Im Kwon Taek's ''Chunhyang'' have the enormous and verdant sweep of a fairy tale, complete with the horrific turns of plot that pound at the heart of unexpurgated versions of folk stories.

Im knows that we all want to believe, because it's clear that he does himself. He toys with the usual conventions of the eager ingenue finding true love by introducing the governor's son as if he were the heroine and focal point, lingering over Cho's unlined and untroubled face.</p>

        <p>Parts of Im Kwon Taek's ''Chunhyang'' have the enormous and verdant sweep of a fairy tale, complete with the horrific turns of plot that pound at the heart of unexpurgated versions of folk stories. This master Korean director, who has made more than 90 films, uses the blush of ardor to warm the tale's familiarity.</p>
        <p>When the picture shifts into a love story and Chunhyang (Lee Hyo Jung), the daughter of a prostitute, and the spoiled and doll-faced Mongryong (Cho Seung Woo), the son of the governor, lock eyes for the first time, he pays homage to the corniest of romances as well as the feelings that such stories can evoke. Im knows that we all want to believe, because it's clear that he does himself. He toys with the usual conventions of the eager ingenue finding true love by introducing the governor's son as if he were the heroine and focal point, lingering over Cho's unlined and untroubled face.</p>
        <p>This year several filmmakers have used this form -- the fable -- as the basis of their movies, but ''Chunhyang'' isn't immersed in the kind of decorative smugness that lets movie audiences in on the joke. Instead the story is freshened through the use of a Korean singing storyteller, a pansori singer, to provide a narration, belting out the song from a stage in front of an audience. The pansori, or song, is performed under a proscenium arch to highlight the ritual elements of folk tales. Even though much of what the pansori tells us unfolds before the cameras at the same moment, the forcefulness of the performance lends another layer of feeling to the picture.</p>
        <p>The device is a worthy addition, because Im makes the delivery of the song as integral to ''Chunhyang'' as the story itself, and it's a neat trick to involve the audience in such a way. Self-awareness here isn't a cheap gambit, a way for the director to have his tongue lounge in the hollows of his cheek. The extravagance of the sets and costumes increases the theatricality; ''Chunhyang'' is an almost childlike delight for the eyes. The picture is at its best when the lovers are playing with each other and intoxicated by the newness of their flesh.</p>
        <p>The film is most effective in moments when Im lets his cast find the truth in the individual scenes, because the story's predictability won't be lost even on the very young. He also uses ''Chunhyang'' as a way to comment on the ubiquity of legend, paying homage to the West by showing a fleeting image of Judy Garland, her eyes as wide as hubcaps and silently pleading for the transformative magnificence of love. His attachment to pure emotion does a lot for the picture.</p>
