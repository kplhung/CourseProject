        <p>THE New York Senate candidates are bopping each other over an issue that has no doubt cost you many a sleepless night: a ban on soft-money donations to their campaigns. They talk about taking the pledge to stay far from that demon cash.</p>
        <p>It sounds terribly important, though explaining it will be left to smarter colleagues who have the advantage of at least knowing how to balance a checkbook. The deeper concern here is with other matters that also cry out for pledges by Representative Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>

        <p>THE New York Senate candidates are bopping each other over an issue that has no doubt cost you many a sleepless night: a ban on soft-money donations to their campaigns. They talk about taking the pledge to stay far from that demon cash.</p>
        <p>It sounds terribly important, though explaining it will be left to smarter colleagues who have the advantage of at least knowing how to balance a checkbook. The deeper concern here is with other matters that also cry out for pledges by Representative Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>We're not about to wave a sheet of paper under their noses with an insistent ''Sign it,'' as you-know-who did to you-know-whom. But given the content and tone of their first debate last week, and later statements, the candidates might reasonably be asked to change their ways in a few key areas.</p>
        <p>No more baseball allusions. Let's face it, for both of them the sport is a field of screams.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's donning a Yankees cap was one of the sillier uses of headgear by a politician since Michael Dukakis rode helmeted in a tank, looking like Snoopy in pursuit of the Red Baron. In last week's debate, it was Mr. Lazio's turn. Trying to show what a real New Yorker and a real guy he is, he blew it by wildly misquoting Casey Stengel (a neat trick, since no one ever understood half of what Casey said).</p>
        <p>Better to leave baseball to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who actually thinks it's important to know Irv Noren's batting average in 1956.</p>
        <p>Defend New York City harder. Neither candidate pointed out last week that Tim Russert, the debate moderator, stated a falsehood in raising a question from a woman in his Buffalo audience. ''As a western New Yorker,'' Mr. Russert said, ''she's very concerned that tax dollars are currently being distributed to New York City disproportionately and wants western New York to receive an equitable and fair amount of money.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the opposite is true. According to the Center for Governmental Research, based in Rochester, New York City gives Albany $2.6 billion more in taxes a year than it gets back in state funds. Yet, on national television, both candidates let this image of the five boroughs as a leech go unchallenged.</p>
        <p>Genug shoyn with the Yiddish. That means ''enough already.'' Both used ''chutzpah,'' or gall, in the first debate. Nothing wrong there, but they might want to quit while ahead. Many Yiddish words that people blithely toss around are in fact exceedingly vulgar. Using them can only lead to trouble. Ask Alfonse M. D'Amato, as in former Senator D'Amato.</p>
        <p>More sports: get the New York football teams straight. In the debate, both pandered to die-hard Jets and Giants fans by expressing their love for ''the three New York teams.'' Wrong! New York has only one team in the National Football League: the Buffalo Bills. The Giants and Jets play in New Jersey, and there they seem destined to stay, unless perhaps Mr. Giuliani gets the West Side stadium that has become his fixation.</p>
        <p>Getting back to things Yiddish, reschedule the next debate. It is set for Oct. 8. That happens to be the eve of Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar. A fair share of the voting public will be focused on matters of somewhat more consequence than the candidates' future. Would they debate on Christmas Eve?</p>
        <p>Besides, the scheduled time is 10:30 a.m., when sophisticated New Yorkers will be tuned to another channel that features New York Times reporters schmoozing. (Oops, a little Yiddish slipped in there.)</p>
        <p>If need be, slap the debate moderator around a bit. Many people thought Mr. Russert stepped over the line in pursuing Mrs. Clinton on the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Did she tell him what he could do with his question? Of course not. That would have meant acting like a normal person. Do you know anyone who wouldn't love seeing a media big shot get clobbered for going too far?</p>
        <p>Drop the hormonal politics. Talk about your ''he said, she said.'' He invades her personal space. She objects. He calls the objection sexist. She likens him to her little brothers. Her people call him a bully. His people -- specifically William Powers, the Republican state chairman -- send out a letter calling her ''an angry woman,'' an ''ambitious, ruthless, scheming, calculating, manipulating woman.'' This Mr. Powers makes ''woman'' sound like a dirty word.</p>
        <p>Everyone would do well to remember that men may be from Mars and women from Venus, but people tend to think that all politicians who behave like this are from Neptune.</p>
