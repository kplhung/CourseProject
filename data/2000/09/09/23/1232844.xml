        <p>Insisting that it has never recognized an embargo on civilian air travel to Iraq, France today let a group fly from Paris to Baghdad.</p>

        <p>Insisting that it has never recognized an embargo on civilian air travel to Iraq, France today let a group fly from Paris to Baghdad.</p>
        <p>The flight, soon after two Russian flights to Baghdad, appeared to be intended to force the Security Council to reconsider its ban on air travel, which is part of the comprehensive sanctions that the United Nations imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.</p>
        <p>The French are encouraging others to follow suit in defying a ban that has been so complete that to reach Baghdad, even diplomats have had to travel overland through Jordan. The Russians said today that they are planning another flight on Saturday, and a Russian airline hopes to start regular service to Baghdad soon. Jordan also wants to begin air service.</p>
        <p>''There will be other flights,'' Ambassador Jean-David Levitte of France said after a Security Council meeting today. ''For many years now, we have considered that there is no flight embargo against Iraq.''</p>
        <p>But the French are not challenging the main sanctions against trade with Iraq, or the United Nations effort to send inspectors to Iraq to ensure that it is not making weapons of mass destruction. Earlier this month France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, warned the Iraqis pointedly that they would have to comply with a new inspection process if they wanted to see the sanctions lifted.</p>
        <p>Still, the American reaction to the flight was swift. The State Department said the flight had been made ''in blatant violation'' of the sanctions. Richard Boucher, the department spokesman, said, ''This supports Iraq's efforts to undermine the authority of the United Nations.''</p>
        <p>Ambassador James B. Cunningham, who handles the Iraqi issue for the United States mission at the United Nations, said: ''We regret that this happened. We would hope it doesn't happen again, but I don't have any confidence in that.''</p>
        <p>The British also objected.</p>
        <p>Agence France-Presse said the flight carried 75 doctors, athletes and writers planning a stay of several days. Diplomats here said they understood that among the passengers were people planning to take part in a cultural festival in the ancient city of Babylon, now rebuilt to some degree by President Saddam Hussein. Iraqi officials greeted the plane when it landed at Saddam Hussein International Airport in Baghdad.</p>
        <p>An Iraqi government newspaper urged all Arabs and others ''to take a courageous stand and resume air links with Iraq.''</p>
        <p>The French gesture perplexed diplomats here and deepened divisions on the Security Council at a critical moment in its relations with the government of Mr. Hussein.</p>
        <p>France has considerable oil industry interests in Iraq, but French diplomats have always argued that those interests are not its motivation in seeking changes or new interpretations of the United Nations sanctions. In addition to the sanctions, Britain and the United States enforce no-flight zones over parts of Iraq, where Iraqi planes are not supposed to operate.</p>
        <p>Today, the Council heard from Hans Blix, the new chief arms inspector for Iraq, about Iraq's continuing refusal to allow monitoring to resume. The Council has no plan for how to meet this defiance, and diplomats do not expect the United States to push the issue during a presidential election campaign.</p>
        <p>After the meeting today, Mr. Blix told reporters that the Council seemed eager to get inspections started, although there has been no Council action. ''There seem to be many people who are guessing that not much might happen before the American elections,'' he said. ''I think that might be a good guess.''</p>
        <p>Last week, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said the Clinton administration would not use force to make the Iraqis accept weapons inspectors.</p>
        <p>Next Tuesday, the Geneva-based commission awarding compensation to victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 meets in an atmosphere of crisis because of attempts by France and Russia to block a reparations payment of $15.9 billion to the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation. The United States is now considering whether to force a vote on the claim, which would normally be approved by consensus. The commission's members are the same as the nations on the Security Council.</p>
        <p>More broadly, Russia, France, China and Tunisia, which holds a rotating Security Council seat, are pressing here to lower the percentage of Iraqi oil earnings set aside for compensation to 20 percent from 30 percent so more money can go to importing goods for Iraqi civilian needs. That demand will be a major focus of debate through the coming weeks and perhaps months.</p>
        <p>Iraq, now exporting oil at levels nearly as high as before the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf, and at very high prices, is expected to earn as much as $20 billion this year, the director of the oil-sales program told the council on Thursday.</p>
        <p>On flights into Baghdad, where President Hussein has now reopened the international airport with some fanfare, Russia, France and China take the position that sanctions do not cover civilian flights, which were barred to isolate the Iraqis after their attack on Kuwait, if no commercial cargo is involved.</p>
