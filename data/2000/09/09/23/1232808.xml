        <p>VATICAN: MEETING WITH JEWS CANCELED  The Vatican was forced to cancel an Oct. 3 symposium on dialogue between Christians and Jews after two Italian rabbis dropped out to protest a Vatican document asserting the primacy of the Roman Catholic Church. Rabbi Elio Toaff, chief rabbi of Rome, and Rabbi Abramo Piattelli told the Vatican that given the current climate, they could not attend. ''It is difficult to organize a celebration between two faiths when one is missing,'' said the Rev. Remi Hoeckman, secretary of the Vatican's office for relations with the Jews.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: PAISLEY PARTY GAINS  The Ulster Unionist Party of David Trimble, the first minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly, lost a seat in the British Parliament to the Democratic Unionist Party of the Rev. Ian Paisley in a by-election that turned on hardening attitudes among Ulster Protestants to sharing power with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the I.R.A. Mr. Paisley, above, called on Mr. Trimble to step down as party leader, saying, ''I think he is finished, absolutely finished.'' But Mr. Trimble replied, ''Yes, we've had a setback, but we're not quitters.''</p>

        <p>UKRAINE: COUP PLOT THWARTED  The domestic intelligence service said it had thwarted a plan by unidentified plotters to overthrow the government of President Leonid Kuchma and attack gas pipelines, a reservoir and the Chernobyl power station. The security service, which claimed barely a week ago to have foiled an assassination plot against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, said the revolutionaries had printed leaflets, begun recruiting armed supporters and drafted a plan to seize government weapons caches.</p>

        <p>SWITZERLAND: EASING ABORTION LAW  After three decades of controversy, the Senate has voted to ease the abortion law, one of the most restrictive in Europe. The procedure is now outlawed in all but exceptional circumstances, but the practice is more liberal, enabling some 12,000 women a year to have an abortion. If the lower house agrees, which appears likely, anti-abortion groups have indicated that they will try to force a national referendum on the issue.</p>

        <p>IRELAND: FINED FOR RACISM  A Dublin bus driver became the first person to be found guilty under Ireland's antiracism laws. Gerry O'Grady, an 18-year veteran of Dublin Bus, was fined $978 for a verbal assault on Matthew John, 24, of Gambia. In addition to using a racial slur, witnesses said, Mr. O'Grady told Mr. John ''go back to his own country'' when Mr. John took food onto a bus. Mr. O'Grady is still employed as a driver, but faces an internal hearing.</p>

        <p>CANADA: FUEL TAX DEBATE  With truckers threatening a strike over high diesel prices, Parliament debated a proposal by the opposition Canadian Alliance to cut federal and provincial fuel taxes, which often account for about 40 percent of retail prices. This year the federal and provincial taxes will total $9 billion. Finance Minister Paul Martin insisted that federal cuts should be matched by provincial cuts, a position opposed by several provinces.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: POLITICS-LADEN DEFAULT  The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) failed to repay more than $3.3 million in loans for the 1994 campaign of President Ernesto Zedillo, the Bank and Securities Commission reported. Opposition leaders have sought to force PRI and Mr. Zedillo to turn over information about the government's efforts to save Banco Union, which collapsed in 1996. Last month the Supreme Court sided with Congress and ordered the president to turn over its records of the bailout. Opposition lawmakers said they would demand that PRI repay all loans.</p>

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: NEW TALIBAN GAINS  The Taliban continued to gain against the rival forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud, capturing Dasht-i-Archi, near the Tajikistan border, a spokesman for the ruling militia said. The Taliban control at least 80 percent of Afghanistan, and recent victories have meant significant gains toward completing their conquest of the nation.</p>

        <p>MYANMAR: PRO-DEMOCRACY AIDES HELD  Striking a new blow against the pro-democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the military government detained her deputy and eight other followers after thwarting their latest attempt to travel outside the capital. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was escorted home from the Yangon railroad station, but Mr. Tin Oo, 77, the deputy leader of the National League for Democracy, was taken to a ''government guest house as a temporary measure to prevent similar incidents,'' the military said.</p>

        <p>IRAN: ARMY WAR GAMES  The army began its largest military exercises of the year in mountainous terrain near the Iraqi border, the state-run television reported. The three-day war games, in Kurdistan province, started a day after Iran test-fired its first solid-liquid fuel missile, raising concerns in Israel and the United States that Tehran is developing a long-range offensive missile capacity.</p>

In addition, leaders of political parties will be barred from attending the meeting in Togo, Communication Minister Henri Cesar Sama said. General Guei said Monday that he had survived an assassination attempt. At least 14 military personnel have been arrested in connection with the attack.</p>
