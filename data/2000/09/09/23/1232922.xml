        <p>A month after officials in Marlboro Township, N.J., approved the state's first ban on the use of handheld cellular phones while driving, Sprint PCS sued to challenge the ban -- and then withdrew the suit yesterday.</p>
        <p>Sprint filed the lawsuit in State Superior Court in Monmouth County on Aug. 25, seeking to overturn the ban on the grounds that only the State Legislature had the authority to regulate motor vehicles, said Larry McDonnell, a spokesman for Sprint, based in Kansas City, Mo.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McDonnell said the company dropped its suit yesterday after learning that the State Senate approved a measure on Monday to establish a task force on driver distractions and highway safety. The measure still awaits a decision by the Assembly.</p>
        <p>Because any state statute arising from the task force's recommendations would supersede Marlboro's ordinance, Mr. McDonnell said, the company decided to shift its focus to the State Legislature, and would testify before the task force if it was created.</p>
        <p>Marlboro's ban, which exempts emergency workers and does not apply to cellular phones with headsets, was approved by the Township Council on July 13. Marlboro became the only municipality in New Jersey, and one of only six in the country, to ban or limit the use of wireless phones while driving, citing research indicating that drivers using them are more likely to have accidents.</p>
        <p>The Municipal Council in Jersey City approved a similar ban on Sept. 13, but it was vetoed on Thursday by Mayor Bret Schundler, after city lawyers questioned the council's authority to impose such a restriction.</p>
        <p>Just when Marlboro's ban will take effect is unclear because the township is awaiting final approval from the State Department of Transportation for road signs informing drivers of the ban, said Stephanie Luftglass, a township spokeswoman.  Barry Denkensohn, the councilman who proposed the ban, said he was pleased by Sprint's decision.</p>
        <p>The suit is the second Sprint has filed against Marlboro. In 1998, the company sued over a moratorium local officials had imposed on the construction of cellular phone towers, after Sprint sought to build a tower there. The suit was dismissed, and in January the company signed a contract to use Marlboro's municipal radio tower for its transmissions.</p>
        <p>But the company is still seeking a variance to build a tower in a residential zone. Mr. McDonnell said dropping the lawsuit had nothing to do with the pending application.</p>
