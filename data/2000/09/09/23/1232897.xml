        <p>Yesterday's surprising decision by the United States to join with Japan and Europe in propping up the euro will not heal the ailing new currency, but it was a gesture worth making.</p>
        <p>The euro's slide poses no grave threat to the world economy. Indeed, by cutting the cost of buying European goods, it helps American consumers and travelers to Europe. A lower euro does make American goods more expensive for Europeans to buy, hurting sales of American exports. But the American economy, according to the Federal Reserve, is in danger of overheating and needs no extra assist from more exports.</p>
        <p>But the sagging euro has seriously hurt some American industries. It also hurts European consumers by driving up the price of imports and makes the European Central Bank's task of keeping inflation low that much harder. If, as the finance ministers believe, the slide of the euro is temporary, then there is an argument for returning it to its long-term value as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>The theory behind intervention is that the euro is falling primarily because currency traders expect it to continue to fall. Intervention, so the argument goes, can swing currency traders around to the idea that the euro's slide is ending, inducing them to buy the euro, thus driving up its price.</p>
        <p>In reality, interventions rarely work. The amount of money that governments are prepared to spend buying euros is tiny compared with the amounts that private currency traders are prepared to sell. Interventions can change currency values, but only if they are tied to changes in government policy. If, for example, the Federal Reserve had intervened yesterday as part of a decision to drive interest rates lower, investors would start selling dollars and buying euros. But that was not the Fed's intent in this case.</p>
        <p>The best case for intervention is that America's European allies asked for help. Someday the United States might seek European assistance to prop up a falling dollar or to rein in a soaring dollar. If finance ministers feel compelled to help one another out, there is little danger in trying.</p>
