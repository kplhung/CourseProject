        <p>It's not often that publicity announcements warn that a ballet is not family entertainment. Yet some of those heralding David Bintley's ''Edward II'' did note that this production ''presents graphic sexual images and is not appropriate for children.''</p>

        <p>It's not often that publicity announcements warn that a ballet is not family entertainment. Yet some of those heralding David Bintley's ''Edward II'' did note that this production ''presents graphic sexual images and is not appropriate for children.''</p>
        <p>When the Birmingham Royal Ballet made its New York debut with the two-act work at the City Center on Thursday night, one learned the reason for such a warning. ''Edward II'' is filled with sex and violence. Yet to anyone who might accuse the British company of mere sensationalism, Mr. Bintley, its director, might point out that his sources are medieval history and classic drama. And although his choreography is sometimes disconcertingly uneven, ''Edward II'' is a serious effort.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bintley has been inspired by historical accounts of the reign of this monarch, who died in 1327, and by ''Edward II,'' Christopher Marlowe's still-enthralling play of 1592. Both in real life and in Marlowe's tragedy, Edward, though married and a father, displayed an inordinate passion for his friend Piers Gaveston. Isabella, Edward's queen, and the English barons grew dismayed by Edward's behavior. A civil war erupted. Gaveston was executed. So, eventually, was Edward, after suffering gruesome sodomistic tortures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bintley does not underplay the unsavory incidents. Yet he provides them with dramatic point. ''Edward II'' never resembles a kinky porn show.</p>
        <p>It is also a sign of how venturesome the Birmingham Royal Ballet can be. Since the 40's, the Royal Ballet in London has often had a second company of some kind. Often it served as a training ground for young dancers. At other times it was a touring group. Earlier incarnations of the organization occasionally visited America.</p>
        <p>When it moved to the British city of Birmingham in 1990, the second company became totally independent of London's Royal Ballet. It has developed its own repertory, featuring provocative new works like ''Edward II'' as well as revivals of such major 20th-century ballets as Leonide Massine's ''Choreartium'' and Ninette de Valois's ''Job,'' which thrilled me when I saw them in England a few years ago and which would surely thrill New York audiences.</p>
        <p>The Birmingham dancers made an impressive debut, for all are blessed with a strong sense of conviction. Mr. Bintley set ''Edward II'' to a commissioned score by John McCabe, which, as played by the Royal Ballet Sinfonia conducted by Paul Murphy, helped emphasize the story's dramatic tensions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bintley was most inventive in scenes for the leading characters. Robert Parker's Gaveston was a bounding scamp. The obviously infatuated Edward of Wolfgang Stollwitzer could not keep his eyes or hands off him. No wonder Monica Zamora, as an innocent-seeming Queen Isabella, was so bewildered by these men.</p>
        <p>Late in the first act came a potentially overwrought yet mesmerizing incident when, after Gaveston's execution, Mr. Stollwitzer clutched a bag supposedly containing Gaveston's severed head while a distraught Ms. Zamora tried to cling to him. Here was a truly macabre romantic triangle</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, throughout the ballet, group sequences were weak. Although Joseph Cipolla, a former member of Dance Theater of Harlem, was a believably surly Mortimer, most of the other barons were spoilsports who just kept marching monotonously. And, to make ''Edward II'' last an entire evening, Mr. Bintley has padded his two-and-a-half-hour production with extraneous choreography, including appearances by fairground entertainers presenting a show that serves as a heavy-handedly allegorical counterpart to what is basically a realistic plot.</p>
        <p>The second act has several dull stretches, especially an interminable court ball. And some of the battle scenes involve little more than running around on a smoky stage. The designs for the second act are also odd. Peter J. Davison's sets for both acts make ingenious use of shifting walls and curtains. But whereas Jasper Conran's costumes for the first act are essentially medieval, some of those for the second inexplicably suggest the early 20th century.</p>
        <p>Despite the weak ensemble sequences, Mr. Bintley again choreographically enlivens his leading characters in the second act. Jonathan Payn was charming as Hugh Despenser, Edward's new male favorite. As hostile forces trap Edward, Mr. Stollwitzer's monarch grew horrifyingly demented, and when he bent to ask for mercy his cringing was pitiable.</p>
        <p>With his studded wristband and codpiece, Toby Norman-Wright, as Lightborn, the executioner, appeared to be en route to a leather club. But this fellow was genuinely sinister. The torture scene was horrifying without being unduly protracted. Even more effective was the moment when Mr. Norman-Wright cradled the king in his arms like an ominously gentle angel of death.</p>
        <p>The most interesting character development was that of Ms. Zamora. Her frail and naive Isabella of the first act submitted to Mortimer's wiles. But, gradually, as the ballet proceeded, she found strength to stand proudly as a stern warrior.</p>
        <p>Such thoughtful interpretations made one curious to see these dancers in a variety of roles. And, later in the engagement, which runs through Oct. 1, there will be a program called ''Jazz Triple,'' featuring three one-act jazz ballets.</p>
