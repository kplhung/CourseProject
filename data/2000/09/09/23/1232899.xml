        <p>Israel Said to Consider U.N. Role in Jerusalem  Israeli diplomats are promoting the idea of United Nations control of the Temple Mount as a way to break the Israeli-Palestinian deadlock over the sacred site, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz said. Officials confirmed only that the foreign minister had discussed the idea with French and Egyptian leaders, noting that Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, had not shown interest in the proposal.</p>

        <p>U.S. Envoy to Israel Removed  Ambassador Martin Indyk, an architect of Washington's policy in the Middle East, was relieved of his post and lost his security clearance pending an inquiry into whether he mishandled classified materials, State Department officials said. There was no suspicion of espionage.</p>

        <p>Clinton Agrees to Put Oil Reserves on Market  President Clinton ordered 30 million barrels of oil released from the nation's emergency reserve in the next month, a day after Vice President Al Gore injected the issue into the presidential campaign. Crude oil prices dropped and analysts said the move could help check the rise in fuel prices.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore held his first news conference in 67 days, defending his call for the oil release and vowing to ''confront friend and foe alike'' over the marketing of violent entertainment to children, despite the big donations he receives from Hollywood.</p>

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush criticized the oil decision and told elderly voters that he would promote medical advances ''with new resources and new resolve'' by increasing financing for the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute.</p>
        <p>A11</p>
        <p>Gore aides distributed news accounts from last year that they said showed Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, then heading an energy-services company, praising OPEC for driving up oil prices.</p>

        <p>E-Mail Reveals Fund-Raisers  Reconstructed e-mail messages given to federal and Congressional investigators show that Mr. Gore's senior aides routinely characterized White House coffee sessions as fund-raising events in early 1996.</p>

        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno said there was no basis for investigating Mr. Gore's relationship to donations from trial lawyers interested in a presidential veto.</p>

        <p>White House Releases List Of Clinton House Guests  President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have had 404 overnight guests at the White House and Camp David since she began campaigning for the New York Senate seat in July 1999. The guests included campaign donors and Democratic fund-raisers. The White House and Mrs. Clinton's campaign denied any link between donations and sleepovers.</p>

        <p>Negotiations to ban soft money in the Senate race collapsed after Mrs. Clinton offered a plan that Rick A. Lazio embraced -- until he learned that outside interest groups could help her but not him.</p>

        <p>Interest Ebbs in Police Career  Only about 1,300 recruits are expected to enter the Police Academy on Sept. 29, far fewer than the nearly 1,600 that officials had expected. Reasons for the shortfall are thought to include pay levels and a tarnished image of the Police Department.</p>
