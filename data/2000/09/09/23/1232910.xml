        <p>Time Warner and America Online have proposed remedies to allay concerns of European antitrust regulators about their proposed $165 billion merger. But the remedies have failed to sway opponents of the deal in the music and Internet industries and among consumer organizations, making it unlikely the regulators will accept them without substantive change.</p>

        <p>Time Warner and America Online have proposed remedies to allay concerns of European antitrust regulators about their proposed $165 billion merger. But the remedies have failed to sway opponents of the deal in the music and Internet industries and among consumer organizations, making it unlikely the regulators will accept them without substantive change.</p>
        <p>Facing objections from the regulators, AOL and Time Warner offered to dissolve gradually an alliance between America Online and Bertelsmann, the German media giant; not to discriminate against European Internet service providers not affiliated with AOL; and to refrain for three years from bundling services in Europe and the United States as a way of coercing customers like advertisers and content providers into exclusive deals.</p>
        <p>The remedies, which were presented to the regulators on Thursday, were intended to disarm concerns among Europeans that another proposed merger -- putting the music businesses of Time Warner into a joint venture with the EMI Group, the British music distributor -- would create a company that would control much of the entertainment business as well as the world's biggest online information provider.</p>
        <p>The proposals by America Online came only days after Time Warner and EMI offered what they called substantial concessions, including the sale of some of their record labels, to dissuade antitrust regulators of the European Commission, the administrative arm of the 15- nation European Union, from blocking their planned $20 billion deal.</p>
        <p>But both deals, which would unite two of the world's biggest music distributors with the leading Internet service provider, still face skepticism among the Europeans. They must decide on the EMI merger by Oct. 18 and the AOL deal by Oct. 24.</p>
        <p>European officials are most concerned about the industry dominance the companies could gain by linking three of the world's five biggest music distributors -- EMI, Warner and Bertelsmann. Under the commission's rules, the regulators must now submit recommendations to advisers from the national antitrust agencies of the 15 European Union members states, who will meet in Brussels on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Amelia Torres, a European spokeswoman on antitrust issues, would not comment on the proposed remedies, but the regulators attached detailed objections to each set of proposed changes. The objections focused on the potential of Time Warner and its proposed new partners to dominate the European market for online entertainment.</p>
        <p>Today was the deadline for other Internet and media companies and industry and consumer organizations to present their views on the concessions. Media companies objected to both transactions at this month's hearings, and executives at several companies said today that the proposals by AOL and EMI had done nothing to alter their views.</p>
        <p>Officials at several companies asked not to be identified because of complex business links that exist with Time Warner and its prospective partners. One executive said that the proposed departure of Bertelsmann from the joint venture with America Online would simply leave AOL in complete control of the venture. Also, the executive said the assurance by AOL not to leverage its dominance of the United States Internet market to press customers in Europe could be easily circumvented through pricing arrangements or bundling, in which America Online would offer customers special deals if they accepted AOL's services on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Other organizations made it clear that they remained opposed. In Brussels, the Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs, a lobbying group that unites 29 consumer organizations in 20 European countries, was expected to uphold the objections it raised in this month' s hearings. It argued that the dominance created by the proposed merger would put Time Warner and its partners in a position to dictate prices to consumers.</p>
        <p>The deals are also opposed by organizations of record producers and music composers, which fear the power of the planned combinations.</p>
        <p>Mario Monti, the European antitrust commissioner, has taken a tough line on large mergers. He has thwarted several major alliances this year, including the planned combination of WorldCom and Sprint. Mr. Monti has the power effectively to block big corporate deals even if the parent companies are not based in Europe because many of those companies rely heavily on the European market.</p>
        <p>In Washington, officials at the Federal Trade Commission have threatened to try to block the AOL-Time Warner deal unless the companies agree to stringent conditions that would guarantee that Time Warner's cable companies remain open to competing Internet service companies.</p>
        <p>The F.T.C. has been studying the effects of the merger on regional phone companies, which have been used heavily by AOL for high-speed Internet service. The F.T.C. and the Federal Communications Commission have also been considering forcing AOL to make its instant messaging application compatible with smaller applications used by rivals like Microsoft and Yahoo.</p>
        <p>Though European officials would not comment on the proposals Mr. Monti will make to the antitrust advisers on Wednesday, the range of his options is wide. He could block the mergers outright or allow one or the other or both. Or he could ask Time Warner and its proposed partners to submit revised remedies.</p>
        <p>Edward Adler, a spokesman for Time Warner, said, ''We are continuing our constructive discussions with the European Commission, and we are on track to close our merger in the fall.'' He refused to comment on whether Time Warner would be willing to make further concessions. AOL issued a similar statement.</p>
        <p>Amanda Conroy, a spokeswoman for EMI, said it had provided a comprehensive response to the regulators' objections, and it would be inappropriate to comment on whether EMI was prepared to make further concessions.</p>
