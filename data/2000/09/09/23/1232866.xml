        <p>The dozens of black-and-orange butterflies being held captive at Monarch Watch 2000 in Central Park fluttered wildly against the net walls of their cage yesterday afternoon when a six-piece mariachi band behind them began blaring the Mexican Hat Dance.</p>
        <p>Maybe it was just something in the air -- the distinct feel of fall on the last day of summer, the light breeze, or perhaps something less tangible in the environment that was calling on the butterflies to try, at that very moment, a desperate attempt to immediately begin their annual migration to Mexico. No one could say.</p>
        <p>Human nature and butterfly nature were deeply intertwined at the annual fall equinox butterfly-tagging at Belvedere Castle, and it was difficult at times to keep the lines straight.</p>
        <p>The butterflies were not natives of the city -- they had been captured near Montauk and driven in for their media closeup before being released. The scientists who created the tagging program -- a kind of monarch census intended to track the creature's annual fall migration -- were from the entomology department of the University of Kansas. The children's dance troop was from New Rochelle. The mariachi band was from New York City, however, and so was the corporate sponsor that created the event, a film production company in Manhattan called MasterVision, which happens to be making a documentary about butterflies.</p>
        <p>''I've fallen in love with butterflies,'' said MasterVision's owner, Richard Stadin.</p>
        <p>Certain wildlife have a power over people, and monarchs are one of them. To many, they represent freedom in the same way that lions mean bravery or dogs loyalty. Fluttering as though buoyed by sunlight and traveling so light that they can sometimes fly nearly 3,000 miles from their birthplaces in the Northeast to their winter homes in Mexico, monarchs seem unbound by the rules that govern the rest of us.</p>
        <p>The director of Monarch Watch, Prof. Orley Taylor of the University of Kansas, whose organization tags about 70,000 monarchs every year with quarter-inch disks stamped with the university's mailing address, said he was cultivating the fascination that many people have for these insects. His group has created a curriculum on the monarch (available at www.Monarchwatch.org.)</p>
        <p>Professor Taylor said his goal was to raise awareness of the fragile and endangered environmental niche that the monarch inhabits. But he said he has heard from teachers who exploit monarch fascination for teaching everything from geography to history to math.</p>
        <p>''The nice thing about butterflies is that they get children's interest, and once you get their interest you can teach them anything,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Using monarchs for such an agenda is not universally popular in the butterfly world. The president of the North American Butterfly Association, Jeffrey Glassberg, denounced yesterday's event, calling it a ''circus sideshow.'' Mr. Glassberg, a molecular biologist by training, said that truly respecting monarchs meant treating them like wild creatures and observing them in their natural environment, not trucking them in for a demonstration.</p>
        <p>''Butterflies are wild animals,'' he said. ''To treat them as little toys that you take around and say, 'Isn't that cute?' sends completely the wrong message to people.''</p>
        <p>Behind the sunniness of yesterday's festivities -- in which children were encouraged to tag a butterfly -- there were some dark shadows. The consul general of Mexico in New York, Jorge Pinto, asked for help in preserving the monarch's Mexican wintering grounds, which one recent study said had been greatly reduced by development and logging.</p>
        <p>There has also been concern that butterflies have become victims in the war against the West Nile virus. Mr. Glassberg said one Brooklyn resident reported finding 60 dead caterpillars on his lawn after pesticide had been sprayed. Parks Department employees at the event said, however, that few butterflies appeared to have been killed by spraying.</p>
        <p>The monarch migration through New York is light this year. But Professor Taylor said that was because last year's drought in Texas killed millions of monarchs on their northbound journey. Like the fragile arc of their flight, he said, their world often hangs by a thread.</p>
