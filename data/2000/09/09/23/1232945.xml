        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>This year, all of the students in the public high school that my daughter attends were given school-sanctioned weekly planners provided by commercial interests. Each page has at least four ads on it.</p>
        <p>Your Sept. 20 news article ''School Laptops Paid With Ads Called Feasible'' described a deal that the New York City Board of Education is about to approve that will give laptop computers to all students in grades 4 through 12. This arrangement will be financed through the use of commercial advertising and e-commerce Web sites directed to this market.</p>
        <p>In marketing and advertising, the saying goes, ''If you get them young, you get them for life.'' It appears that the Board of Education is willing to sell our children to the highest bidder. Is this what we call school reform?</p>
