      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Japan's leading automaker, the Toyota Motor Corporation, said yesterday that it was likely to report higher earnings for the first half of its fiscal year than it had anticipated as sales were stronger than expected in North America and Europe. Toyota raised its profit forecast by 43 percent, to 100 billion yen, or nearly $1 billion, for the six months ending in September. It will probably sell 10,000 more cars domestically and 60,000 more for export to North America and Europe than it originally expected.</p>
