        <p>CONGRATULATIONS are in order to us, the good old U.S. of A., master of the sporting universe. Americans are not only pulling away from our Olympic hosts, the upstart Australians, in the overall medal race here at the 2000 Summer Games.</p>
        <p>We are also persevering in the war of attitudinal wills.</p>
        <p>We have come Down Under and convinced these misguided people that they've been going about it wrong. We have shown them that gracious is not grand, or necessarily good. We are making them understand that in the arena of serious competitive endeavor, there is nothing quite like a little hate, mate.</p>
        <p>The face of the American sportsman here in Australia is right in his or her opponent's. But the Australians didn't pour $6 billion and their international reputation into the Olympics to be trash-talked and dissed by these impudent Yanks, by the likes of Vince Carter and Gary Hall Jr.</p>
        <p>They have steeled themselves, Americanized themselves. Or as Lauren Jackson, the Australian women's basketball prodigy, said after Lisa Leslie went out of her way to chest-bump her in a pre-Olympics game, ''You want a piece of me?''</p>
        <p>While describing this encounter with Leslie, Jackson later added, ''As you Americans like to say.'' And we have been saying and doing other things to annoy the typically thick-skinned and ''no worries'' Aussies, who suddenly became our archenemy, probably for no greater reason than we just happen to need one.</p>
        <p>It's how we do sports, home and away, as our hard-staring gladiators jump off edgy covers of the sports magazines to win, in the name of their corporate sponsors. To the Australians, we are a country of chest-bumpers, a nation of Knicks. On their home turf, in their prized pool, they have found themselves in unnatural positions, assuming a more responsive posture, as when their beloved 200-meter swimmers strummed away in celebration after Hall had promised the United States would ''smash them like guitars.''</p>
        <p>''I would say there's a real difference in attitude,'' said Tanya Harding, the Australian softball pitcher, who briefly disguised herself as a U.C.L.A. student several years ago, until a national title was secured. ''Americans are so used to excelling at sport, so I suppose that expectation is really the ideal word to describe the difference.</p>
        <p>''We, on the other hand, have that great Australian spirit. If you win, you win, but if you don't, that's O.K., as long as you played hard and didn't lay down.''</p>
        <p>Before the Games began, an Australian long jumper, Jai Taurima, discounted his American counterparts by saying, ''You can pretty much knock out all the dark athletes,'' implying that black Americans would not excel here in the cool spring weather. It was, at best, an ignorant statement, reminding us there are fools and bigots everywhere.</p>
        <p>Yet, international Australian athletes have always seemed less flamboyant than Americans, which is a generalization, but what isn't at the Olympics? They have been the gentlemen tennis legends, Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall. They are Patrick Rafter catching an errant service toss and offering a heartfelt ''Sorry, mate.'' They are young Ian Thorpe winning his first Olympic gold medal in the 400 meters last Saturday night and climbing out of the pool to direct his first words -- thank you -- to 19 million Australians.</p>
        <p>Australians are national teams named Boomers and Opals and Hockeyroos, and Andrew Gaze, emerging from a discouraging opening Olympic basketball loss to Canada to say: ''Not that bad. They've got some good beds at the Olympic Village. You want to talk about some real problems, talk to the Angolans. They're at war, and my father used to say, 'The only time winning is absolutely crucial is in surgery and war.' ''</p>
        <p>Of course, before the Olympics even began, Gaze found himself an unwilling combatant with Carter, whom he had the audacity to foul in a practice game. Several days after Carter stood menacingly over the fallen Gaze like Ali over Liston, the 35-year-old Gaze was selected to carry the Australian flag in the opening ceremony. Coincidence? Perhaps not.</p>
        <p>Australians, meanwhile, have been hissing at Carter and the other Americans since. For the first week, at least, these hospitable sports-loving people were transformed into our Olympic foes and foils. They have not appreciated Americans' preening on the premises and, on top of that, they managed to hang in, right on our heels, in the medals standing, until the United States swimmers began hoarding gold the last couple of days.</p>
        <p>It will only get worse, more one-sided, as track and field heats up, with more look-at-me Americans like Maurice Greene. Today, though, the Aussies were standing in the way of a gold medal for the American women's water polo team. They continue to be our worst softball nightmare. Jackson and the Opals might even be capable of sending Leslie and Co. home without gold.</p>
        <p>Without politics to fall back on, Communists to target, we have to make do with what's out there. Nothing personal, but the Australians are the home team, and we are here to play our game.</p>
