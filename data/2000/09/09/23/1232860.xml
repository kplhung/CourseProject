        <p>When the central banks of the world's leading industrial nations intervene in the currency market, there are winners and losers.</p>
        <p>The currency traders who are betting that the euro will continue to decline lost yesterday. But if they had been making this bet for a while, they are still way ahead -- the euro is still down 13.7 percent in value against the dollar so far this year. And if they think that the euro will rally, they can just change their bet and make more money.</p>
        <p>A recovery in the euro would help American exporters. The weak euro has made their products more expensive in Europe, hurting sales. And for companies that have big markets in Europe, their sales and earnings in euros have been reduced when they are exchanged for stronger dollars. Indeed, a number of big multinationals -- including Gillette, DuPont, Colgate-Palmolive and McDonald's -- have recently warned that the weak euro will reduce their third-quarter earnings.</p>
        <p>American companies competing against European imports in the United States would also like a stronger euro and a weaker dollar. A weak euro makes European products, like cars, cheaper, hurting domestic sales.</p>
        <p>But American travelers to Europe will have reason to be unhappy with a rally in the euro, if it happens. Travelers to some parts of Europe, like France, have not seen such bargains when it comes to exchange rates since the mid-1980's.</p>
        <p>But whether it is American tourists or multinationals that benefit from yesterday's action depends on whether the intervention works as planned.</p>
        <p>In this case, successful intervention would mean that the euro begins to climb in value. But achieving that success may take more coordinated interventions and a clear sign that Europe is growing at a faster economic clip while the United States is slowing significantly. That would make Europe more attractive to global investors, meaning they would buy more euros to invest there. But that trend has not taken hold yet.</p>
