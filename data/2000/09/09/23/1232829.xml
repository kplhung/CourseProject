        <p>In front of a hushed crowd spellbound by the tension, the American David O'Connor had just guided the silky black Custom Made gracefully over a tricky fence, and appeared halfway to the gold medal stand. Until he hesitated.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, he was in the middle of the course, swiveling his head in every direction, desperately looking for the seventh fence. After making history with his masterful riding in the first two days of the Olympic individual three-day event, O'Connor's mental compass simply shorted out.</p>
        <p>Perhaps out of the Australians' reflex kindness toward visitors, the crowd broke with equestrian etiquette and began crying out, ''The wall, the wall,'' frantically pointing out the correct direction.</p>
        <p>Isolated by his panic, O'Connor didn't hear them. On his own, he found the way -- just in time. O'Connor gently tugged Custom Made back on track, and the horse leapt over the white-brick wall to avoid an unthinkable elimination. Just under the 90-second time limit, with only one jump penalty, O'Connor had won America's first gold medal in this prestigious event since 1976.</p>
        <p>Upon victory, Custom Made galloped around the fringes of the course, with O'Connor tilting his face to the Windex-blue skies above and shaking his head in disbelief.</p>
        <p>''I was worried about the green gate,'' O'Connor said, referring to the sixth fence. ''I got so wrapped up, I got a little lost. There was a moment there for words that can't be printed. I was so upset about my mental lapse, it took a while to get over it.''</p>
        <p>The sound of the national anthem soothed him. In an instant, he was filled with emotion, standing proudly as his wife, Karen, stood next to the scoreboard several yards away. She had a cell phone in her hand, and was holding it up so her parents could share the moment in the United States.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, David O'Connor was handed an American flag, mounted Custom Made and galloped around the arena like a leader of the cavalry. Behind the ecstatic O'Connor, there was the silver medalist, Andrew Hoy of Australia, aboard Swizzle In, and New Zealand's Mark Todd, who ended his glorious career with a satisfying bronze on Eyespy II.</p>
        <p>''It was a great ending,'' said Karen O'Connor, who, with her husband, won the Olympic silver medal in the three-day team event in 1996. ''I jumped every jump with David today. When he was lost, I was lost. I was like, 'What's happening?' The crowd was saying, 'The wall, the wall.' I was like, 'Oh my God, come on, David.' ''</p>
        <p>Not only did her husband avoid disaster on the third day of the event, but he was also nearly perfect on the treacherous cross-country stage on Thursday. The refined style of this sport belies the danger riders and horses can encounter with one misstep.</p>
        <p>On the cross-country course, there were several harrowing spills. The Brazilian Roberto Macedo was crushed beneath his horse after tumbling over a jump, leaving him with a fractured pelvis. A few minutes later, horrified spectators watched Bermuda Gold, ridden by Mary Jane Tumbridge of Bermuda, break a bone in her leg. Veterinarians could not save the horse.</p>
        <p>''It's a huge relief to finish my career without a major injury,'' said Todd, 44, whose 16-year Olympic career includes two gold medals in the individual three-day event. ''I got a little nervous before the cross-country run.''</p>
        <p>Todd, Hoy and O'Connor came through unscathed. In the end, no one approached O'Connor's near perfection over the three days. His one mental lapse had not cost him, so it was time to celebrate. Long after the medal ceremony, the O'Connors were hanging around the grounds, talking to friends on a cell phone, while taking sips out of a Champagne bottle. If there had been a toast, someone might have said, ''Here's to the sport's best rider.''</p>
        <p>''I don't equate what I've done in that way,'' said O'Connor, who resides in The Plains, Va. ''The horse has to be at the top of the world, too.''</p>
        <p>O'Connor rode Custom Made beautifully, calmly, right to a gold medal. Today, the 38-year-old O'Connor's remarkable path to the summit was complete. But he didn't arrive on the crest of a cash flow from a wealthy family. There is an old-money perception associated with equestrian events, but that was not O'Connor's reality. Although he grew up around horses, his background was modest.</p>
        <p>One common thread to his childhood was the persistence of his mother. For several years, she took him to local shows, and to some events not so local. There were a number of trips across the country, and times when they had to knock on doors because they couldn't afford a hotel.</p>
        <p>By age 12, O'Connor was an expert at overcoming adversity. As a child, he was 70 percent deaf in one ear and 50 percent deaf in the other. Until his hearing problem was diagnosed in elementary school, his teachers believed he had a learning disability. That seems unimaginable now. O'Connor is a bright, articulate athlete, with a sense of humor, as well.</p>
        <p>Once he had the gold medal around his neck, he could even laugh at the funny thing that happened on his way to the medal stand. For a moment, in the middle of the jumping course, he was in a deep stage of panic.</p>
        <p>''My head is still sore from being on a swivel,'' O'Connor said with a smile. ''Unbelievable.''</p>
