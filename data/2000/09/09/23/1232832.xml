        <p>In his upscale neighborhood of ranch-style houses in Las Vegas, Jonathan Burton was known as a model citizen. He helped young children learn to ride bicycles and play video games.

        <p>In his upscale neighborhood of ranch-style houses in Las Vegas, Jonathan Burton was known as a model citizen. He helped young children learn to ride bicycles and play video games. He carried groceries for elderly people. ''I wish he was my son,'' said Mary Mahoney, who lives next door to the Burton family.</p>
        <p>But on a Southwest Airlines flight last month from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City, where Mr. Burton was planning to visit relatives, a different side of him emerged -- a wild and frantic side, according to passengers on the plane. His behavior cost him his life at the hands of fellow travelers who restrained him after he tried to kick down the door of the cockpit. He was 19.</p>
        <p>''There is no question in my mind that that young man threw away his life as a direct consequence of his own actions,'' said Adam P. Bradshaw, who was sitting in an aisle seat toward the rear of the Boeing 737 and watched events unfold. ''I feel profoundly sad over this, but the reaction of the passengers trying to restrain him came in direct proportion to the violence he was causing.''</p>
        <p>Federal authorities in Salt Lake say they have closed their investigation. The United States attorney for Utah ruled Mr. Burton's death a homicide but concluded there was no ''criminal intent'' by those involved and declined to prosecute anyone.</p>
        <p>Conflicting accounts emerged in the days following the incident, but interviews this week with witnesses paint a more consistent picture of what happened on the flight, which had 121 passengers.</p>
        <p>Yet with the authorities refusing to discuss details of the case, a central question remains: Why did a likable young man suddenly try to break down the doors of a cockpit in midflight, argue with flight attendants and fight with passengers?</p>
        <p>Witnesses said that the Aug. 11 flight was routine until about 20 minutes before landing.</p>
        <p>At that point, Mr. Bradshaw -- who is the news director at KTVX, the ABC affiliate in Salt Lake -- said he saw Mr. Burton walk toward the rear of the plane, take a drink off a cart and walk back. Over the next few minutes, Mr. Burton walked up and down the aisle several times, once pausing at Mr. Bradshaw's seat. ''He had very frantic eyes,'' Mr. Bradshaw said.</p>
        <p>John Whitaker, a retired Army officer and construction project manager, said he told his business partner in the seat beside him, ''That dude's trouble.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burton then returned to his seat, the passengers recalled. Christy Gibson, a Las Vegas resident sitting across the aisle from Mr. Burton, said she then heard the attendant ask if he needed help.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gibson said Mr. Burton responded ''No, I'm fine. It's just the drugs.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gibson said, ''That scared me. I figured he was on drugs, but I had no idea what his intentions were.''</p>
        <p>Seconds later, passengers said, Mr. Burton bolted toward the front.</p>
        <p>''About five feet from the cockpit door, he leaped into the air with both feet at the door, like a long jump,'' Mr. Bradshaw said. ''He hit with both feet. Then, with one foot against the wall, he tried to pull the door open, wildly jerking around, then beating the door with his fists and yelling, although I couldn't understand what he was saying.''</p>
        <p>A Canadian passenger, Dean Harvey, told The Edmonton Journal that he heard Mr. Burton yelling, ''I can fly this plane!'' Other passengers said they did not hear that.</p>
        <p>Moments after Mr. Burton attacked the cockpit doors, breaking the center panel, several male passengers tried to calm him down, Mr. Bradshaw said. He and others disagreed with Mr. Harvey, who told the Journal that Mr. Burton reached into the cockpit, grabbing the pilots.</p>
        <p>But as the men began escorting Mr. Burton back to his seat, Mr. Whitaker said, he scrambled for the emergency-row exit in the middle of the plane. ''He was saying something like 'I've got to go, I've got to get out of here,' '' Mr. Whitaker said.</p>
        <p>People in the row had moved, giving the men a chance to surround Mr. Burton, and try calming him, Mr. Whitaker said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gibson said the men asked Mr. Burton simple questions, like ''What's your name?'' and ''Where are you from?'' to get his mind off the flight. ''Then he calmed down,'' she said.</p>
        <p>At this point, the plane was starting its approach into the Salt Lake airport. Ms. Gibson said that, given Mr. Burton's behavior, attendants did not want him in an emergency-exit row so they asked some men to help move him to another seat. One man asked to help, Ms. Gibson said, was an off-duty police officer.</p>
        <p>''They started to move him down the aisle to the back of the plane,'' Ms. Gibson said, ''but when he heard police officer, he freaked. He went ballistic. He punched the police officer in the face, split open his lip and blood was all over the place.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradshaw said that pandemonium broke out. As six to eight men tried to control Mr. Burton, Mr. Bradshaw said, he was ''whaling on people.''</p>
        <p>''It was a violent fight, no doubt,'' he said. ''They finally got him face down on the floor, but he was still kicking, screaming at the top of his lungs.''</p>
        <p>In his account, Mr. Harvey said the men were excessively aggressive, with one man jumping onto Mr. Burton's chest repeatedly after the young man was subdued.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bradshaw and Ms. Gibson disagreed. ''There was never any mob mentality,'' Mr. Bradshaw said. ''And I don't care what any other passenger says, I'm convinced nobody wanted to hurt that kid.''</p>
        <p>''We were scared,'' Ms. Gibson said. ''Women were crying.''</p>
        <p>About five minutes before the plane landed, with the men still holding Mr. Burton down, the screaming stopped, passengers said. When the plane reached the gate, airport police officers and paramedics boarded, handcuffed Mr. Burton and carried him off.</p>
        <p>''When we came off the plane, they were tending to him in the jetway,'' Mr. Bradshaw said. ''They had the paddles out, ready to use. But I think he was gone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burton was pronounced dead at a Salt Lake hospital. The cause of death was first reported to be cardiac arrest, but the autopsy report said he died of asphyxiation.</p>
        <p>An autopsy report said that Mr. Burton had traces of cocaine and THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, in his system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burton's mother, Janet Burton, told reporters in Las Vegas this week that she did not believe her son used illegal drugs. Mrs. Burton, a widow, did not respond to messages left for her, and no one answered the door today at her Las Vegas home. Her lawyer, Kent Spence, did not respond to repeated messages.</p>
        <p>The circumstances of the death still reverberate on Marrow Road in Las Vegas, where Mr. Burton lived with his mother.</p>
        <p>Friends and neighbors described him as a joy to know; not one said she ever knew him to act violently or use drugs. ''He was too smart for that,'' said Martha Ford, who lived across the street from the Burtons until three years ago.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Ken Young, an information officer for the Clark County School District, said officers who worked at Cheyenne High School, from which Mr. Burton graduated, had no idea who he was, a sign that he had never been in trouble. A computer search found no evidence that Mr. Burton had ever committed a crime.</p>
        <p>''I'm a retired police officer,'' said Ms. Mahoney, the neighbor. ''I'd know a rotten kid if I saw one.''</p>
        <p>Isabel Orvis, Mr. Burton's supervisor at the Life Care Center of Las Vegas, a nursing home where he had worked the last three years as a housekeeper, praised him for helping the elderly residents.</p>
        <p>''He would stop what he was doing and go take care of their needs,'' she said. ''You need to be so patient to care for them, and he really cared about them. He never lost his temper; he never had an attitude with anybody.''</p>
        <p>Others said Mr. Burton was just as patient with children; Jennifer Yonesawa, another neighbor, recalled him teaching her daughter how to play basketball.</p>
        <p>''He was a good example to my own boys,'' Ms. Ford said.</p>
        <p>Perhaps no one was more distraught over what happened than Mr. Burton's grandmother, Jean Tiltson. Ms. Yonesawa said that when she and family members were planning funeral arrangements, Ms. Tiltson suffered a heart attack. She was unable to attend the services.</p>
