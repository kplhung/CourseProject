        <p>THE AD CAMPAIGN</p>
        <p>ADDRESSING HATE-CRIME LEGISLATION -- A gay rights organization will broadcast a radio campaign in seven states whose Republican senators or congressmen oppose a bill to make attacks on gays a federal hate crime, one of President Clinton's top remaining priorities. Beginning Tuesday, the Human Rights Campaign will run radio ads for four days in four states where Republican senators are fighting tough re-election battles: Washington, Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. The $60,000 campaign will also run in Mississippi and Illinois, home states of the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert. Ads will also run in California, aimed at Representative James E. Rogan, one of the Republican impeachment managers.</p>

        <p>THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>CROSSING PARTY LINES -- Good news and bad news for Representative George Nethercutt, a Washington Republican who pledged in 1994 to retire after three terms but is now running for a fourth: He won the primary on Tuesday, but the man he defeated threw his support yesterday to Mr. Nethercutt's Democratic opponent. The losing Republican, Richard Clear, endorsed the Democrat, Tom Keefe, saying, ''It's time we looked at the man, not the party.'' Mr. Keefe, a former Congressional aide, won the Democratic primary with 21 percent of the vote.</p>

        <p>TRAVEL LOG</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore stopped by the Pittsburgh Steelers' practice, where he threw a couple of passes and tried to sneak a peek at the team's playbook as they prepared to play Mr. Gore's home team, the Tennessee Titans. (He also attended his son's football game in the evening.) Meanwhile, Gov. George W. Bush rounded out his weeklong swing through nine battleground states in Florida. The stats:</p>
        <p>Length of the Official Day: Gore, 10 hours; Bush, 13 1/2 hours</p>
        <p>States Visited: Gore 2, Bush 1</p>
        <p>Towns and Cities Visited: Gore 2, Bush 4</p>
        <p>Press Conferences/Interviews: Gore 3, Bush 6</p>
        <p>Events: Gore 3, Bush 5</p>
        <p>Diners Visited/Unscheduled Drop-bys: Gore 1 (Steelers practice), Bush 0</p>
        <p>Passes completed: Gore, 2 for 3; Bush, 0 for 0</p>
        <p>Main message: Gore, helping families deal with high home heating costs and oil prices; Bush, new policy initiatives on health, including proposed increases for health research.</p>
