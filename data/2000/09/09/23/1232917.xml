        <p>President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have had 404 overnight guests at the White House and Camp David since Mrs. Clinton began campaigning for the New York Senate seat in July 1999, including scores of donors to Mrs. Clinton's campaign and several of the Democratic Party's most prominent fund-raisers.</p>
        <p>The Clinton campaign said that about 100 of the overnight guests were contributors to her campaign, giving limited ''hard money'' contributions, or unrestricted ''soft money'' donations, or both. But the White House and the Clinton campaign vigorously denied any link between campaign donations and sleepovers at the White House. [List of overnight guests, Page B4.]</p>
        <p>''Absolutely not,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary. ''These are friends, public officials and supporters to whom they wanted to extend the opportunity to stay with them in their home. Any suggestion to the contrary is false and unsupportable.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, campaigning in Westchester County this afternoon, said: ''We have lots of friends and supporters who spend time with us, spend the night with us. I don't have anything else to add other than we have given you the information, and I don't think it is particularly newsworthy. The vast majority of the people on the list have not contributed to my campaign.''</p>
        <p>Of the overnight guests who contributed to Mrs. Clinton's campaign, 77 gave a total of $108,000 in direct or hard-money donations to her Senate campaign, according to a preliminary analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. Forty-six sleepover guests gave $516,000 to related fund-raising committees, chiefly the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and New York Senate 2000, accounts that are designed to accept unlimited soft-money contributions, the center found. Some of the guests gave to both accounts. Mrs. Clinton has raised more than $33 million in hard and soft money for her campaign, according to federal campaign finance reports.</p>
        <p>Larry Makinson, the center's director, said the figures might contain minor errors because a number of the overnight guests have common surnames.</p>
        <p>The center found that 146 of the guests had made political contributions in this election cycle, giving a total of $5.5 million, 98 percent of it to Democratic committees and candidates. The Democratic National Committee was the single largest recipient, with $2.5 million. Vice President Al Gore's campaign got $142,750, the center found.</p>
        <p>Among those who spent the night at the White House were three of the biggest contributors to Mrs. Clinton's soft-money campaign account, New York Senate 2000: Vinod Gupta, an Omaha Internet entrepreneur; S. Daniel Abraham, the founder of SlimFast Foods in West Palm Beach, Fla.; and Lisa Perry, a longtime Democratic fund-raiser and donor from Manhattan. Mr. Gupta, Mr. Abraham and Ms. Perry together gave Mrs. Clinton more than $228,000, according to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which oversees Mrs. Clinton's soft-money account.</p>
        <p>The three are also large contributors to other Democratic candidates and committees.</p>
        <p>The Clintons also were host to Paul W. Adler, the Rockland County Democratic Party chairman who was indicted last week on federal fraud and bribery charges. Mr. Adler was an early supporter and fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Other New York political figures favored with overnight invitations include Michael Bragman, the former State Assembly majority leader; C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president; the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, the former congressman; and State Assemblyman Thomas P. Di-Napoli, the Nassau County Democratic leader.</p>
        <p>The list of overnight guests also contains several of Mr. Gore's top fund-raisers, as well as a number of the Democratic Party's most generous sponsors in recent years. Among those are Terry McAuliffe of Washington, Alan Patricof of New York, Norman Pattiz of Los Angeles, Haim Saban of Beverly Hills, Calif., Howard J. Kessler of Boston, Chris Korge of Miami, William Brandt of Chicago and Smith and Elizabeth Bagley of Washington.</p>
        <p>Several of the overnight guests have given or pledged sizable sums for the Clinton Presidential Library, a project for which Mr. Clinton and Mr. McAuliffe have been raising tens of millions of dollars, a Democratic supporter said. Those donors include Steven Spielberg, Arnold Simon, Gerald Schuster, Mr. Saban, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Korge and the Bagleys, the supporter said.</p>
        <p>The Clintons were host to prominent figures including Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and King Juan Carlos of Spain, former President Jimmy Carter and former Senator George McGovern. They also entertained numerous Hollywood figures, including Chevy Chase, Ted Danson, Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman, Quincy Jones, Michael Medavoy, Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan and Will Smith.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart said that overnight privileges at the White House and Camp David were never given as a reward for contributions or an incentive to donate in the future.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Lockhart asserted that the Clintons would continue to put up guests in the Lincoln Bedroom, other White House residential quarters and Camp David during the remainder of Mr. Clinton's term in office.</p>
        <p>Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause, a group that advocates stronger campaign finance laws, and the Democratic former attorney general of Massachusetts, accused the Clintons of using the White House as a tool to advance their personal and political interests.</p>
        <p>''What is particularly shocking is that it appears no lessons were learned from scandals of 1996, and that the current occupants of the White House are using it as a personal trophy and not the people's house,'' Mr. Harshbarger said.</p>
        <p>''What amazes me is that there is no sense of limits or shame,'' he added. ''Now to use it in furtherance of one of the occupants' personal political goals in the State of New York is a new low.''</p>
        <p>The White House released the list this afternoon, two weeks after The New York Times requested it. It covers guests who stayed overnight from July 1, 1999, when Mrs. Clinton began her ''listening tour'' in New York as a prelude to her campaign for the Senate, through Aug. 31, 2000.</p>
        <p>The catalog groups the guests in six categories: Arkansas friends (51 people), longtime friends (102), friends and supporters (86), officials and dignitaries (77), arts and letters and sports (45), and Clinton family members and Chelsea Clinton's friends (43). The White House did not provide names for the last group, citing privacy concerns.</p>
        <p>The list does not provide hometowns of guests nor does it provide the date or dates of sleepovers (several of the guests stayed more than once, Mr. Lockhart said). Mr. Lockhart said the dates were omitted because it would have taken several additional days of research and because he did not want reporters drawing unfounded inferences about a connection between overnight stays and campaign contributions.</p>
        <p>Nor did the White House detail whether guests were housed at the White House or at Camp David. The list does not include members of the Israeli and Palestinian delegations and United States officials who participated in the Camp David talks on the Middle East this summer.</p>
        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, Mrs. Clinton's opponent, said the amount of information released was insufficient, adding that the link between sleepovers and donations would be clear if the White House released the dates of the overnight stays. His aides suggested that the Clintons were not present at the White House or Camp David when some of guests stayed there.</p>
        <p>''We demand that Mrs. Clinton release the dates of the sleepovers by all of her White House and Camp David guests,'' said Bill Dal Col, manager of the Lazio campaign. ''New Yorkers deserve to know if she was there, 'getting to know' these big donors or if they were merely renting out these taxpayer-owned monuments like a cheap motel.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart said there might have been some occasions when neither Clinton was present when a guest stayed overnight. But he attributed those instances to last-minute scheduling changes and the Camp David peace talks, which ran longer than expected.</p>
        <p>The issue is particularly sensitive because President Clinton was widely criticized in 1997 when it was learned that he had used White House coffees, overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom and rides aboard Air Force One to encourage supporters to donate to the Democrats and to reward those who had already done so. The White House released a list of 938 guests who had spent the night at the White House, prompting a flurry of Congressional criticism and negative press coverage.</p>
        <p>''The Lincoln Bedroom was never sold,'' the president said at the time.</p>
        <p>One of the guests on the current list, Jill Iscol of Pound Ridge, N.Y., said she resented the implication that the Clintons were auctioning off White House stays to big donors.</p>
        <p>She and her husband, Kenneth Iscol, a telecommunications executive, have known the president and Mrs. Clinton for six years. They met through their children; Zack Iscol, now 22, met Chelsea Clinton when they were teenagers.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Iscol said her family stayed overnight at the White House last December but their largess to the Clintons and the Democratic Party predated their sleepover. The Iscols have given more than $29,000 to Mrs. Clinton's campaign and helped raise tens of thousands of dollars more for her.</p>
        <p>''The Clintons are dear, wonderful friends and have been for six years,'' Mrs. Iscol said. ''I'm spending my life on this campaign because I believe in it. There is no quid pro quo in this operation.''</p>
