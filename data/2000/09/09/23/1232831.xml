        <p>South Korea will have to spend another 50 trillion won, or about $44 billion, to prop up domestic banks, which were hit hard by the collapse of efforts last week to sell off the nearly bankrupt Daewoo Motor Company, the nation's finance minister, Jin Nyum, said today.</p>
        <p>While officials had anticipated that the $6.9 billion sale of Daewoo Motor to the Ford Motor Company would reduce bank exposure to the ailing carmaker, Ford unexpectedly walked away from its bid last week, creating a sense of urgency for the South Korean government to accelerate its restructuring efforts.</p>

        <p>South Korea will have to spend another 50 trillion won, or about $44 billion, to prop up domestic banks, which were hit hard by the collapse of efforts last week to sell off the nearly bankrupt Daewoo Motor Company, the nation's finance minister, Jin Nyum, said today.</p>
        <p>While officials had anticipated that the $6.9 billion sale of Daewoo Motor to the Ford Motor Company would reduce bank exposure to the ailing carmaker, Ford unexpectedly walked away from its bid last week, creating a sense of urgency for the South Korean government to accelerate its restructuring efforts.</p>
        <p>As of December 1999, South Korean financial institutions held 64.5 trillion won of long-  and short-term debt from 12 of the Daewoo Group's largest affiliates, including Daewoo Motor, according to the government.</p>
        <p>''I apologize to the public and to the National Assembly for the need to raise additional public funds,'' Mr. Jin said at a nationally televised news conference. ''The economy is currently in a difficult situation.''</p>
        <p>Since the inauguration of President Kim Dae Jung in February of 1998, the government has pumped in 45.2 trillion won to bolster its embattled banks, according to the Ministry of Finance and Economy. The government has pushed financial institutions and companies to lower debts under the guidelines of a $58 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund in late 1997.</p>
        <p>The government is now seeking approval from the National Assembly to raise an additional 40 trillion won through a bond offering and to generate another 10 trillion won by recovering funds from financial companies that had received earlier government money, Mr. Jin said.</p>
        <p>On his appointment last month as finance minister, Mr. Jin vowed to complete the government's bank overhaul by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>To quell jittery investors, the ministry will release quarterlyreports on how the bailout is proceeding, Mr. Jin said. It is still uncertain, however, whether the new injection of money will be sufficient in itself to bail out the troubled banks.</p>
        <p>''Over the short term, the injection of public funds will be effective,'' said Kim Dae Shik, an economics professor at Chung Ang University. ''But over the longer term, bank debts will only increase again unless the government becomes a tough traffic cop and resolves corporate debts.''</p>
