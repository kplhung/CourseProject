        <p>Negotiations over an agreement to ban soft money in the New York Senate race collapsed yesterday after Hillary Rodham Clinton offered a plan that was initially embraced by Representative Rick A. Lazio -- until he learned that it contained more restrictions on him than on her.</p>
        <p>By last night, Mr. Lazio was denouncing Mrs. Clinton as the ''queen of dirty money'' and saying that she was clinging to legalistic excuses to avoid a deal.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton insisted that Mr. Lazio's aides had engaged in some sleight of hand in the bargaining over an agreement. She based this assertion on what appeared to be her interpretation of an 18-word clause in a letter that her campaign received from the Lazio campaign on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides said they were baffled and infuriated by her reasoning.</p>
        <p>It was a remarkable shift during the day from apparent good will to vitriol between candidates who have argued for weeks over soft money, the largely unregulated contributions that have eroded a system of limits on federal elections imposed after Watergate.</p>
        <p>Soft money is raised by party committees in unlimited amounts and is supposed to be used for so-called party-building activities, like voter drives, not to provide direct assistance to candidates. But the parties have got around this rule by using soft money to buy commercials that promote or criticize candidates without invoking the election.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Mr. Lazio has sought to put Mrs. Clinton on the defensive over soft money because she has benefited from at least $5 million in commercials financed by soft money she collected in conjunction with Democratic allies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who has not raised soft money, asserts that he has championed a ban because it will restore the public's faith in elections. But his aides concede that as a strategic matter, a ban would cut off vital funds for Mrs. Clinton, whose recent fund-raising for her official campaign committee has been sluggish. A campaign committee can accept donations of up to $1,000 per person for the general election.</p>
        <p>In the morning, Mrs. Clinton took the stage at a breakfast meeting in Rye, N.Y., and announced that even though her candidacy might suffer financially if she renounced soft money, she would immediately do so as long as Mr. Lazio followed suit.</p>
        <p>''Let's make it simple, effective, enforceable and fair,'' she said. ''Today I will urge the political parties supporting me not to buy any more soft-money issue ads on TV or radio as long as the parties and other groups helping my opponent don't buy any more of those ads either. All it will take to do this is one word from Mr. Lazio: O.K.  So how about it, Mr. Lazio? O.K.?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio had wanted a written agreement drafted by lawyers, and monitored by two leading proponents of campaign finance reform, Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lazio immediately agreed to this more informal one, and his aides sent a letter to the Clinton campaign, outlining what they understood to be the agreement: no soft-money spending by political parties on behalf of either candidate and no spending by outside political groups, either.</p>
        <p>Campaigning upstate, Mr. Lazio declared victory, announcing what he said was a historic change in campaign finance practices. Around the same time, though, Mrs. Clinton's aides issued a statement saying there was no deal, accusing the Lazio campaign of ''double talk.''</p>
        <p>The stumbling block was spending by outside political groups, which is technically not soft money because it is not collected by political parties, but is effectively the same. In the New York race, for example, an abortion-rights group has bought commercials supporting Mrs. Clinton, and a group that backs moderate Republicans has done the same for Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>It turns out that Mrs. Clinton wanted to ban soft-money spending for both candidates; however, outside political groups could help her but not him. Her aides pointed to her statement at the breakfast, noting that a close parsing of the language revealed the distinction.</p>
        <p>When the Lazio campaign responded that such a rule was unfair, the Clinton campaign said that the Lazio campaign had actually agreed on Thursday to the same thing. The Clinton campaign pointed to the 18-word clause in the letter that it had received from the Lazio campaign during the talks.</p>
        <p>The two sides had been discussing how each candidate would be required to obtain signatures from outside groups pledging to not spend money in the race. In the letter, the Lazio campaign said that to speed up putting an agreement in place, ''we have dropped our precondition that you attain the signatures of the outside interest groups supporting your campaign.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said the clause demonstrated that the Lazio campaign no longer would require the groups supporting her to stay out of the race. By saying yesterday that such groups would have to refrain, the Lazio campaign had ''reimposed a condition they had taken off the table,'' she told reporters.</p>
        <p>The Lazio campaign called her interpretation nonsense, maintaining that it was merely letting the Clinton campaign know that if necessary, it could obtain some of the pledges after the agreement was in force.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton and her aides have long expressed concern that conservative political groups would spend heavily to defeat her, though until now, they have mostly used her as a fund-raising vehicle while spending  relatively little.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said that these groups were closely tied to the Lazio campaign and as a result should be barred from spending in the race. The groups supporting her, such as the National Abortion Rights and Action League and various unions, are more independent, she said.</p>
        <p>''There is a big difference having an organization that is a longstanding institution that makes independent decisions, and an organization with your supporters on the board that calls the shots where the money goes, which is what he has,'' she said. ''I don't think it is comparable at all. I think it is a very different situation, which apparently they recognized last night and decided to change their minds about today.''</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters in Elmira last night, Mr. Lazio ridiculed Mrs. Clinton. ''I twice voted for campaign finance reform in the House, and we issued the pledge,'' he said, referring to his call for an agreement. ''Now today, we see more evasion, more ducking, more distortion of the truth. Let me tell you, there is not going be any coronation this November of the queen of dirty money.''</p>
