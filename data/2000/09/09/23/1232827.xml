        <p>American Jewry has been dying for as long as anyone can remember, the remarkable rise of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman notwithstanding. But despite recent signs of decline -- in 1990, the National Jewish Population Survey found a 52 percent intermarriage rate,  shocking much of the Jewish world --  the rumors of its death have been greatly exaggerated.</p>
        <p>These days Jewish life is showing renewed vigor. This is the judgment of several longtime commentators as well as frontline workers in the field -- rabbis and Jewish professionals -- who have gone about doing their statistical and spiritual work despite the dour predictions. For these individuals, even factoring intermarriage in, the glass is at least half full.</p>
        <p>Several synagogue leaders, for example, have begun to rethink their policy of excluding the intermarried from active participation in Jewish life, reversing a 30-year trend of being unwelcoming or dismissive. Indicative of the change is that instruction for interfaith spouses used to be called conversion classes; now it's called ''Introduction to Judaism.'' It's a minor alteration of language that bespeaks a deep shift in perception.</p>
        <p>Certain scholars, among them Sylvia Barak Fishman, an associate professor of contemporary Jewish life at Brandeis University, warn that it is too early to judge the impact of the more liberal attitude toward intermarriage, especially when the non-Jewish spouse does not convert. Ms. Fishman, who spent the last year intensively studying intermarriage, said that many non-Jewish husbands she had interviewed expressed ''considerable resentment about being frozen out of the religious lives of their children.''</p>
        <p>''The situation is a good deal more complicated than we thought,'' she said. ''There are lots of nuances we have to be alert to.''</p>
        <p>Pessimists about the future of American Jewry come in many forms. Among them must be counted Samuel G. Freedman, a former reporter for The New York Times and occasional contributor to it. In his new book, ''Jew vs. Jew: The Struggle for the Soul of American Jewry,'' he looks at six incidents of serious strife among Jews, incidents that illustrate his thesis that civil war is brewing.</p>
        <p>But generally, one's expectations rest on how data from the 1990 survey are interpreted. Two of the most prominent commentators on the intermarriage statistics were Elliott Abrams and Alan M. Dershowitz.</p>
        <p>Both published much-discussed books on the crisis facing American Jews in the late 1990's; Mr. Abrams's was titled ''Faith or Fear'' and Mr. Dershowitz's ''The Vanishing American Jew.'' The pictures they painted were not encouraging to those concerned about recent trends. Mr. Dershowitz argued that secular Judaism, bolstered by a strong educational basis in Jewish texts, was the solution to the issue of ''the vanishing American Jew.'' Mr. Abrams suggested that only a return to traditional Judaism would stave off doom.</p>
        <p>Three years after publication, neither author has moved much beyond his position, but Mr. Dershowitz, the high-profile Harvard law professor, seems a good deal more optimistic than Mr. Abrams, the president of the Washington-based Ethics and Public Policy Center. Both writers agree on one thing: Two opposing trends are at work in Jewish life right now.</p>
        <p>''There's an incredible renaissance of Jewish culture going on for some, and at the other extreme there's increasing assimilation, withdrawal and intermarriage,'' Mr. Dershowitz said. ''What this means is that the Jewish community, which used to be a continuum of involvement, has become a dichotomy. More and more people are more active than ever before in things Jewish and more are also vanishing. But the Jewish activity that is taking place is truly remarkable.''</p>
        <p>Another guarded optimist is J. J. Goldberg, the author of ''Jewish Power,'' who was recently appointed editor of the English-language Forward newspaper. As a reporter, Mr. Goldberg was one of the first to write with skepticism about the 52 percent intermarriage figure, and he is still ''appalled'' that people regard it as a legitimate number. His research, as well as that of others he interviewed, led him to believe that the rate was no more than 35 percent. But whatever the number, Mr. Goldberg agrees that intermarriage is having a profound effect on American Jewry. It is his contention that a whole new Judaism is being born in reaction to intermarriage. ''There are Jews now who live in both the Jewish and gentile worlds,'' he said. ''And nobody knows what the implications of this are. I'm a traditional Jew, and this is a Judaism that I wouldn't particularly want in my life. But it is a part of my people. It's where we're going. I might as well complain about the rain.''</p>
        <p>''That something is going on in the Jewish community is undeniable,'' Mr. Goldberg continued. He said that Jack Wertheimer of the Jewish Theological Seminary had told him ''that $9 billion a year is flowing through the treasuries of the Jewish institutions in America.''</p>
        <p>''That's more than the gross national product of some member countries at the U.N.,'' Mr. Goldberg said. ''The vitality in the community, by virtue of the level of the money available, is staggering. Then there are the art forms that have been created -- the klezmer revival, which is becoming a legitimate form of pop music in America, and the novels and stories. Twenty years ago, people were mourning the death of American Jewish writing, that after Roth and Malamud and Ozick, that would be it. Now you have all these writers -- Allegra Goodman and Nathan Englander, and whole new ones younger than they are. It's a very Jewish literature and very American.''</p>
        <p>Another optimist (who has been called a visionary by many of his colleagues) is Barry Shrage, the president of the Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston. ''All of a sudden, there's a huge hunger for Jewish learning,'' he said. But he added: ''It's also clear that the Jewish community is hungry for a vision that will make sense in their lives. What we lack are the leaders who can articulate that vision and create a real community of learners.''</p>
        <p>''As the baby boomers have aged,'' Mr. Shrage said, ''they've had a great interest in spirituality. Now that can go two ways. One way is the 'studying Cabala with Madonna' way, which will be gone in a matter of years. Or we can really work to create a community of serious learners.'' Mr. Shrage also contends that every intermarriage is a great opportunity: ''What has to be said to the non-Jewish spouse is, 'We have a gorgeous tradition. Come learn with us.' ''</p>
        <p>A recent book that identifies a way to harness the potential of Jewish seekers and, in turn, reanimate one of the fundamental institutions of Jewish life is Rabbi Sidney Schwarz's ''Finding a Spiritual Home.'' The author argues that if Jewish leaders can tap into the great spiritual energy fermenting among disaffected Jews, they can remake the synagogue and form the kind of ''community of learners'' that Mr. Shrage speaks of.</p>
        <p>In his book, Mr. Schwarz profiles four synagogues that he sees as models for the future. Each of these ''synagogue-communities,'' as he calls them, is led by a ''visionary'' rabbi; has an egalitarian spirit; is based on a carefully articulated viewpoint; has imbued its congregants with a sense of empowerment; and is deeply committed to scholarship and worship.</p>
        <p>But even after creating such a synagogue, which is no small feat, the problem remains of how to attract the mass of Jewish seekers, who often are looking for enlightenment everywhere but in the synagogue. ''The Jewish community would call these people 'lost Jews' rather than 'Jews that we lost,' ''  Mr. Schwarz said. ''I'm talking about Jews who seek spiritual answers in alternative settings, whether it's through Buddhism or meditation. So many people stand ready. You go to such settings and the number of Jews there dwarf the number that are active in Jewish-sponsored programs.</p>
        <p>''If you go to these places and you listen, what you see and hear are Jews hungering to get connected with their tradition. It's then you realize that we're sitting on a gold mine called Judaism.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwarz laments that the reintroduction to Jewish life is often poorly handled.  ''Let's take somebody who's, say, 30 years old and has been to Jews for Jesus and has spent time in an ashram. And he shows up at a synagogue on Yom Kippur. In a typical synagogue, how would he be greeted? 'You've strayed,' the rabbi might say, 'but we're happy to have you back.' That's the wrong way to do it. What should be said is: 'You've explored truth in many ways, some that really touched your soul. We'd love to learn from you about what you saw and heard.' ''</p>
        <p>''Rabbis have to relearn what touches the souls of Jews,'' Mr. Schwarz said, ''and not assume that doing the same service we've done for centuries is going to do the job.''</p>
