        <p>Proposed labor contracts that Nassau County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta has negotiated with three county law enforcement unions would cost the county up to $200 million over the next five years, the comptroller said today.</p>
        <p>Critics of the contracts say the additional costs could wipe out the cuts that Mr. Gulotta proposed last week to balance the county's budget.</p>
        <p>The roughly $200 million in added costs are based partly on a 22 percent wage hike for county police officers and detectives, who are already among the highest paid in the nation, and a more than 28 percent pay increase proposed for correction officers at the Nassau County jail, proposed contracts show.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta has repeatedly said the contracts would save the county $60 million in increased law-enforcement costs over five years, starting with about $20 million in savings next year through various union concessions. He needs the savings as part of a multiyear plan to balance the county's budget and to prevent a state oversight board, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, from seizing control of the county's finances.</p>
        <p>But a day after Mr. Gulotta provided the tentative contracts to other county officials at finance authority's request, the comptroller, Frederick E. Parola, and the Democratic and Republican leaders of the County Legislature expressed doubt that that the concessions would offset the costs of the pay increases and other benefits in the long run.</p>
        <p>''Are the savings real or imaginary? That would be our first burning question,'' said Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat who is the presiding officer of the Legislature.</p>
        <p>Peter J. Schmitt, a Republican who is the legislative minority leader, criticized Mr. Gulotta, saying: ''I don't find those savings in there. I don't know how he thought he could get this past the NIFA board. That is a board of experts. They are going to tear this thing apart, I would think.''</p>
        <p>If the contract proposals are struck from Mr. Gulotta's budget plans, Frank G. Zarb, the finance authority's chairman, said he expects county leaders to suggest alternative means of making up the difference. That prospect seemed more likely today because of the opposition to the proposed contracts.</p>
        <p>Martin Scheinman, who mediated the proposed contracts, said he believes the pay increases are lower than what he estimated county law enforcement officers would receive under binding arbitration -- if they could not reach settlements with the county. He said police and correction officials vouched for the savings that the proposed contracts would generate.</p>
        <p>''I am not carrying the water to the well for any of these agreements,'' Mr. Gulotta said in an interview Wednesday. ''If these agreements don't meet muster, if the numbers aren't real, I'm not going to endorse them either.''</p>
        <p>The average county police officer, who works 232 days a year, earns about $90,000 in total annual pay, while a 25-year captain earns a total of about $130,000 annually.</p>
        <p>The proposed contract with the Police Benevolent Association increases the number of personal days officers can cash in at retirement to 20 from 15. Termination payouts to retiring police officers already average $200,000, and with 200 officers now retiring, those costs are expected to top about $40 million this year. The county has budgeted $25.9 million for about 130 retirements expected next year.</p>
        <p>The proposed contract defers a 3.75 percent raise called for next year until 2002, a tactic Mr. Parola said would strain the budget in the future.</p>
        <p>Another point of contention is longevity pay, which would increase by more than $800,000 a year, beginning in 2003, under the proposed contract, because of a provision crediting time served in other departments toward eligibility for such pay.</p>
        <p>That would be costly, critics said, because roughly 23 percent of the Nassau police force have prior police experience in other departments, according to Deputy Inspector Pete Matuza, a spokesman.</p>
        <p>The proposed contract also includes a provision that would give the union its concessions back if the finance authority became a fiscal control board, which is possible, and froze the officers' wages.</p>
        <p>Aides to Ms. Jacobs said they had many questions about the proposed contracts. For instance, they questioned how much would be saved by a proposal to put civilians in 110 jobs now being done by police. They said they feared that the savings would not be felt until later years, though cost savings appear to be calculated for next year.</p>
        <p>The concessions will be returned to the P.B.A. at the end of the contract, said Darren Bloch, chief of staff to the legislative majority. He said that Mr. Gulotta's multiyear plan, which extends through the end of 2004, does not include the costs for the last year of the proposed contracts, 2005.</p>
        <p>All in all, the proposed contracts show no concern for Nassau's fiscal plight, Mr. Parola said. He said he would suggest seeking suspension of the state law requiring binding arbitration to allow the county to reflect on its fiscal crisis and renegotiate the contracts.</p>
        <p>''Here we are literally nickeling and diming with layoffs of employees making $30,000 or $40,000 a year and meanwhile it is politics as usual with Gulotta,'' he said. ''And I am almost appalled.''</p>
