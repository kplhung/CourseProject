        <p>Former President George Bush may have a mannerly reputation, but shortly after the Republican National Convention opened in Philadelphia, he was burning to mix it up with President Clinton for saying not-so-nice things about his eldest son.</p>
        <p>''I'm tempted to get off the reservation,'' Mr. Bush told NBC News in late July. If Mr. Clinton is still denouncing his son after a month, he said of the man who vanquished him, ''I'm going to tell the nation what I think about him as a human being and a person.''</p>
        <p>In the nearly two months after he uttered those words, Mr. Bush had kept a decidedly low profile and seemed to stay, squarely, on the reservation.</p>
        <p>Until today. Unable to resist the temptation, Mr. Bush seemed to endorse the House vote to impeach Mr. Clinton. At a fund-raising luncheon in Miami for Representative Bill McCollum, a Republican who is running for the Senate in Florida, Mr. Bush made what Mr. McCollum's aides said was an unmistakable reference to the lawmaker's vote to impeach.</p>
        <p>''I'm not in the issue business any more,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But I'm in the character business. And I know a man of character when I see one. I saw him take a lot of heat a few months ago in the House, held his head up high, and did what he felt was right. And whether you agree or not -- and I 100 percent agree -- I think people respect'' his decision.</p>
        <p>During the impeachment proceedings, Mr. Bush studiously avoided any comment on his position. While Mr. Bush did not mention Mr. Clinton or Vice President Al Gore by name today, the former president peppered his speech with references to honor, integrity and credibility.</p>
        <p>''I am absolutely convinced that if our son is elected president of the United States,'' Mr. Bush declared, ''we will restore the respect, honor and decency that the White House deserves.''</p>
        <p>After his speech, Mr. Bush slipped out of the hotel ballroom, briskly and quietly, determined not to say anything that would thrust himself back in the headlines.</p>
        <p>People close to the Bush family said the former president has taken pains since the Republican convention to keep a low profile, and do nothing to distract from his son's campaign. They said he seems to regret his comments about Mr. Clinton. (Mr. Clinton, while not shy about castigating his predecessor's administration, has refrained from inflammatory language that could provoke Mr. Bush.)</p>
        <p>''He realizes that this race in its last month and a half is about two people, Bush and Gore,'' an associate of Mr. Bush's said. ''He gets the joke. He realizes that the best he can do is help raise money and stay out of the way. Unlike most politicians I know, he's very adult about it. No one had to bribe him to leave Philadelphia.''</p>
        <p>Still, for all his care about not having too large a public persona, the former president cannot always resist expressing his strong feelings about what he believes has been a breach of trust in the Clinton White House.</p>
        <p>Today, for example, Mr. Bush said, ''I'm not here to attack George's opponent at all.'' But with barely a pause, he gleefully recalled how Mr. Gore, at a rally the other day, sang part of a union jingle that he said was from his childhood but that actually had not been written until he was an adult.</p>
        <p>''The guy had the foresight to listen to a song that was written 27 years after he listened to it,'' he said, adding, ''I couldn't begin to debate the issues any more. But I can speak up when we have character.''</p>
        <p>Yet the Bush campaign might be best advised against making Mr. Clinton's personal lapses a big issue. Polls have shown that slicing into the president's values -- while helpful in rallying partisans -- does not carry weight among swing voters.</p>
        <p>In other areas as well, some advisers to Governor Bush say he might be prudent if he steers clear of his father's advice. Though the precise extent of his father's role is unclear, campaign advisers say Governor Bush turned to the former president for counsel on two crucial decisions that have drawn decidedly mixed reviews: the selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate and the initial reluctance by the campaign to negotiate with the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.</p>
        <p>People close to the Bush family said the former president never liked debates and never trusted the commission. In an interview with PBS to be broadcast on Sunday on a documentary about debates, the former president acknowledged his distaste for debates, which he derided as ''show business.''</p>
        <p>Explaining why he checked his watch during his last encounter in 1992 with Mr. Clinton and Ross Perot, Mr. Bush said, ''Was I glad when the damn thing was over? Yeah. And maybe that's why I was looking at it.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Bush flashed a glimpse of his family's competitive spirit by letting it be known that he relishes the notion of his son toppling politicians who think they have the upper hand. He recalled that in the 1994 campaign, then Gov. Ann Richards of Texas derisively mocked Mr. Bush as ''Shrub.''</p>
        <p>'' 'He's a Shrub -- Little Shrub is taking me on,' '' the former president quoted Ms. Richards as saying. His son won, he said, ''because his word is good -- he'll say something and he means it and it comes from the heart.''</p>
        <p>Senator Connie Mack, a Florida Republican who is retiring from Congress, scoffed at the idea that the Bushes were motivated, at all, by a desire to get back at the Democrats for ousting President Bush in 1992.</p>
        <p>''President Bush is not that kind of man and neither is his son,'' Mr. Mack said. ''That father wouldn't allow that. He's has opportunities for the past eight years to say things about Bill Clinton and Al Gore and he's refrained.''</p>
        <p>Asked, then, about the elder Mr. Bush's nearly verging off the reservation at the convention, Mr. Mack replied: ''That was a little different situation. And it was very short lived.''</p>
