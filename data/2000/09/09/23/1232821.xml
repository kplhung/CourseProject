        <p>When the billion-dollar J. Paul Getty Center opened its sprawling hilltop complex in December 1997, the throngs visiting the art museum were overwhelming.</p>
        <p>The wait for a parking reservation, often viewed the same as a ticket to the museum, reached up to six months that first year. A table at the restaurant? Visitors might as well have been asking for courtside seats to a Lakers game.</p>
        <p>A success story, definitely, but the 1.8 million visitors that first year outstripped resources and surprised museum officials who had expected attendance to be about 1.3 million. Advance planning by visitors was a must, which helped feed a perception that the Getty was inaccessible.</p>
        <p>But as the Getty ends its third year in its lofty new location in Brentwood, west of Beverly Hills, that is changing. With attendance estimates in 2000 down a half million from that first year, officials are actively cultivating their local audience. They have loosened the requirements for parking reservations and bolstered community programs.</p>
        <p>''This is a moment for us. A time to reassess,'' said Deborah Gribbon, who on Oct. 1 will become director of the museum. John Walsh, whose tenure as director included time at a previous location, is stepping down after 17 years. ''It's a time of evaluation,'' Ms. Gribbon said, ''of taking stock and then moving forward.''</p>
        <p>The museum has been educating residents of nearby communities -- particularly families -- about what the Getty has to offer.</p>
        <p>''Whether we were victims of our own success or not, I think it's not a bad thing for something to be so popular,'' Ms. Gribbon said. ''I think we now have the ability to bring in more visitors.''</p>
        <p>While the Getty has for many years had family and community programs, it has increased the number of family programs over the past year and doubled the number of self-guided school visits.</p>
        <p>The Getty is beefing up its outreach through community breakfasts and special programs in local libraries and community centers. Two groups that the museum is particularly interested in capturing are families with children and young adults in their early 20's.</p>
        <p>''I think not only do we want to build a museumgoing audience, but I think that's a way to really be of service to the community,'' Ms. Gribbon said.</p>
        <p>She noted that since the museum exempted college students from having to make parking reservations, the average age of visitors has dropped, from the early 50's to the mid-40's. (Parking reservations have recently been dropped completely on weekends and evenings.)</p>
        <p>Successful programs have already been started around Venice and North Hollywood, and museum officials say they are interested in learning from the community how to serve it best.</p>
        <p>''They are not just planning in isolation, they are planning in the community,'' said Vendella Barnett, deputy director of the Neighborhood Youth Association, a preschool and after-school program serving low-income youths in Venice and nearby Mar Vista. ''They're saying, 'You're on the front line every day, tell me what might be some of the ways to get around barriers.' ''</p>
        <p>They present programs in the community as well as arranging for visits to the museum by families.</p>
        <p>''Everything does not have to happen at the Getty,'' Ms. Barnett said. ''Muhammad has to come off the mountain, and they have really done a good job of coming into this community.''</p>
        <p>Elvira Linarte, whose 9-year-old son attends the Neighborhood Youth Association after-school program, said she had been familiar with the Getty but never saw it as a place she would visit.</p>
        <p>''I always thought, 'I don't know,' '' she said, explaining that it seemed too aloof. Ms. Linarte said her reaction to the news that a Getty representative would be presenting a slide show at a parents' meeting was, ''How long will this take?''</p>
        <p>But she found herself enthralled. The talk was followed by a free trip to the Getty for families at the center, and featured music, arts and crafts for the children and audio tours in Spanish and English. Now she goes every time she gets the chance. On one occasion, she took 14 relatives in two vans on a weekend only to find they needed a parking reservation.</p>
        <p>They quickly got around the requirement, dropping the bulk of their group and parking their vans at a shuttle location.</p>
        <p>''We stayed till they closed,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As a single mother who works as a patient coordinator with the Venice Family Clinic, Ms. Linarte said making ends meet can be tough. The Getty has given her some lessons she can teach her son.</p>
        <p>''We're still struggling to survive day to day,'' she said. ''It's really hard to get to a lot of these places and take your kids, but the Getty has made me aware of all the beautiful things that are out there, and I can pass that on to my son.''</p>
