        <p>As the Republicans renewed their attacks on Vice President Al Gore over his plan to tap the nation's oil reserves, Mr. Gore's aides fought petroleum with petroleum today. They released news accounts from last year that they said showed Dick Cheney, who was then the chief executive of an energy-services company, praising the global oil cartel for driving up worldwide oil prices.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign, stung by Republican accusations that Mr. Gore's plan is unwise and politically motivated, released accounts of an energy conference in 1999 attended by Mr. Cheney, then the chief executive of the Halliburton Company. In the accounts, Mr. Cheney appears to praise the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for agreeing to take more than two million barrels of oil off the market to drive up prices, which had been kept low by a worldwide glut.</p>
        <p>Halliburton and other energy companies had been hurt by the low prices, and Mr. Cheney was quoted in news accounts at the time as saying, ''I'm struck by the extent to which OPEC seems to have got its act together.'' Another account characterized him as ''optimistic'' at the prospect -- which his campaign now denies.</p>
        <p>An aide to Mr. Cheney defended him today, saying that at the time of the conference, the price of oil had dipped to $10 a barrel. The aide said that was an unsustainably low price that drove people out of the oil business and had brought on the current spike in prices.</p>
        <p>The punches and counterpunches came after a week in which Mr. Cheney stepped up his criticisms of Mr. Gore, and underscored the degree to which the Gore campaign hoped to turn public anxiety over rising oil prices against Mr. Cheney and his running mate, Gov. George W. Bush, who both have ties to the industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's campaign also attacked a central component of the Bush campaign's proposal to bring oil prices down: their call to increase domestic production by allowing drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, a move that Mr. Gore and many environmentalists oppose. Mr. Gore's aides noted that Mr. Cheney's old company, Halliburton, had pushed plans to open the refuge to oil drilling in the past.</p>
        <p>Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney, said, ''Unlike Al Gore, Secretary Cheney has always made his decisions based on what's in the national interest and is good for the country, rather than for any personal or political gain.''</p>
        <p>And aides noted that Mr. Cheney has agreed to divest himself of his holdings in Halliburton if elected vice president, so he would not benefit from the proposal to open the wildlife refuge to drilling.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Cheney was asked on Thursday if he thought it was politically risky to advocate drilling in the arctic reserve, known as Anwar, he stood his ground. ''I think we ought to develop the Anwar reserves in Alaska,'' he said. ''In my opinion it would be silly not to.''</p>
