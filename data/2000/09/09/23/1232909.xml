        <p>They did the same unorthodox training every day in Phoenix. They performed with the same cartoonish brashness. They ate a diet similar to the winner of the Kentucky Derby. And tonight they stood together on the top rung of the Olympic medal podium, each draped with an identical gold medal around his neck.</p>
        <p>Gary Hall Jr., who has struggled with diabetes, a suspension for marijuana use and a lifetime of expectation, and Anthony Ervin, the first swimmer of African-American descent on the United States Olympic swimming team, touched the electronic timing device at the same exact moment in the 50-meter freestyle race. When they turned to look at the scoreboard, both saw a rare and joyous sight. First place was registered next to both of their names in 21.98 seconds, and they pumped their fists in triumph.</p>
        <p>At the United States Olympic trials in Indianapolis last month, Ervin hugged Hall's father, a three-time Olympic medalist, and said, ''Maybe we will be lucky and tie for the gold in Sydney.''</p>
        <p>And now they had.</p>
        <p>Hall and Ervin hugged and shook hands and put their arms around each other's shoulders. The training partners held up their medals for the cameras, their smiles as luminous as their victory had been uncommon and unexpected.</p>
        <p>Only once before had two gold medals been awarded in the same Olympic swimming race. At the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles, Nancy Hogshead and Carrie Steinseifer of the United States were declared dual winners of the 100-meter freestyle.</p>
        <p>At the 1972 Munich Games, Gunnar Larsson of Sweden and Tim McKee of the United States finished in what appeared to be a dead heat in the 400-meter individual medley. Larsson was awarded the gold medal when the timing was carried out to thousandths of a second. The rule was later changed to award gold medals to any swimmers who finished tied within hundredths of a second. The new rule applied in the Hogshead-Steinseifer race in 1984 and in tonight's 50 freestyle.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't share this with a nicer guy,'' Hall, who will be 26 next week, said of Ervin, who is 19 and a sophomore at the University of California at Berkeley. ''We trained together every day in the summer. This was just like another day at practice.''</p>
        <p>The United States won a third gold medal tonight when Brooke Bennett of Plant City, Fla., took the 800-meter freestyle for the second consecutive Summer Games in 8 minutes 19.67 seconds, an Olympic record. She also won the 400 freestyle last Sunday, and now stands as the best American distance swimmer since Janet Evans.</p>
        <p>Bennett was a heavy favorite. She won by three seconds. Hall and Ervin were improbable victors. Hall won two relay golds at the 1996 Atlanta Games, but he seemed destined to play the perpetual foil to Aleksandr Popov of Russia, who won the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyles at the past two Olympics. Hall finished second in both of those races in Atlanta, and third in the 100 freestyle here on Wednesday. Before tonight, he had never defeated Popov.</p>
        <p>In the waiting room before the Atlanta races, Hall said the Russian had taunted him. Popov called him soft, Hall said, and, in a reference to Hall's father, also an Olympic swimmer, said, ''You are from family of losers.'' Tonight, Hall finished first, while Popov faded to sixth.</p>
        <p>The bronze medal went to Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands (22.03), who had won the 100 and 200 freestyles here and had emerged as tonight's favorite. But he, too, could do nothing but chase the Americans in the 50 freestyle, a churning anaerobic sprint during which Hall breathed once and Ervin breathed not at all.</p>
        <p>Before this year, Ervin was largely unknown even in the American swimming community. He grew up in Valencia, Calif., and he seemed so reticent at Berkeley that the swim team had to send a scout party to find him for the first meeting of his freshman season. He quickly made a name for himself by setting a world record of 21.21 seconds for the 50 freestyle when swum in a short-course (25-meter) pool at the national collegiate championships last March. At the Olympic trials, Ervin swam the third-fastest 50 free ever for the 50-meter pool in 21.80 seconds, while Hall swam the second fastest in 21.76. Only Popov has swum faster, in 21.64.</p>
        <p>Ervin's mother is white and his father is black and American Indian. He marks several boxes on forms when asked about his race, he said. While he does not understate that he is African-American, he has not been comfortable being pigeonholed into a certain racial classification, he said.</p>
        <p>''I've always been proud of my heritage,'' Ervin said. But, he added, ''I don't think of myself as the first of this or the first of that.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''People try to pin me down to say one definitive thing. It's just not ever been an issue with me. I never really thought about it. I feel in American society, something like having diverse blood would not be that big a deal.''</p>
        <p>Beginning the season in anonymity, Ervin said he considered himself a long shot even to make the Olympic team. Hall, too, was no certainty. On March 20, 1999, he learned he had diabetes, which has affected his ability to train vigorously for sustained periods. He can swim no longer than 30 minutes during a workout before having to check his blood-sugar level, and he has to inject himself with insulin up to eight times a day. Hall was so exhausted when he arrived in Sydney for the Games that he had to lie down in the airport. When the American swimmers headed to a training camp in Brisbane, he remained behind to swim on his own.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't be any lower,'' Hall said of the despondency he felt when his diabetes was diagnosed.</p>
        <p>Gradually, Hall recovered his famous playfulness. At the Olympic trials, he trotted out in a boxing robe and a pair of red-white-and-blue trunks like the ones worn by Apollo Creed in ''Rocky.'' And he has drawn Ervin out of his shyness. Both delight in mugging to the crowd before races. Tonight, Ervin held his hands over his head, while Hall kissed his biceps, flexed and threw an uppercut at the audience of 17,500 at the Sydney International Aquatic Center.</p>
        <p>Idiosyncrasy is not generally tolerated in the regimented world of swimming, but it has been embraced by Mike Bottom, who coaches Ervin at Cal and has been Hall's personal coach for four years.</p>
        <p>Bottom organized a training group of a dozen swimmers at the Phoenix Swim Club this summer and put them through a series of unconventional drills. One involved swimming 25 meters, jumping out of the pool, running through an obstacle course of tires, dunking a basketball three times and jumping back into the pool -- an aerobic workout designed to keep their heart rates above 150 beats a minute.</p>
        <p>''We pushed ourselves to the limit,'' Hall said. ''I wouldn't have reached this on my own.''</p>
        <p>Hall and Ervin performed explosive sprint workouts, sometimes while tied to the side of the pool to increase resistance. Out of the pool, they ran, kick-boxed and punched a speed bag to bring fun and variety to their training. They also ate what they called ''horse bars,'' a human version of the protein-laden equine diet used by Fusaichi Pegasus, the most recent winner of the Kentucky Derby. Ervin, especially, has remarkably lowered his best time, to 21.80 from 23.50, with the exotic workouts and diet.</p>
        <p>''It's all legal; anyone can buy it,'' Bottom said in response to questions about performance-enhancing drugs that inevitably accompany remarkable performances.</p>
        <p>This moment had been anticipated for Hall for his entire life by his father, Gary Hall Sr., who competed in three Olympic swim meets, won two silvers and a bronze, carried the flag for the United States at the opening of the 1976 Montreal Games and held his toddler son aloft on the pool deck after one of his races.</p>
        <p>Gary Jr., however, was a reluctant swimmer. At age 14, he was forced into the pool by his father, who considered him a slacker and decided that he should become proficient at something other than video games.</p>
        <p>''You can still see my footprint on his butt,'' Gary Hall Sr. said.</p>
        <p>Before arriving here, Hall wrote on a Web site that although he loved Australia and its swimmers, the Americans would ''smash them like guitars.'' Kieren Perkins, the two-time Australian gold medalist, responded that he would not listen to a ''drug cheat,'' a reference to the fact that Hall had been suspended for three months in 1998 after having tested positive for marijuana. When Hall was caught by Australia's Ian Thorpe in the 4x100-meter freestyle relay last Saturday, the Australians taunted Hall by playing imaginary guitars.</p>
        <p>A week later, the Americans had 12 gold medals and the Australians 4.</p>
        <p>''I knew it was going to be close,'' Hall said. ''I didn't know it would be that close.''</p>
