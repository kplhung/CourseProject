        <p>Dr. Anne E. Dyson, a pediatrician known for her philanthropy in the field of children's welfare, died yesterday at her home in Millbrook, N.Y. She was 52.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dyson died after a yearlong struggle with breast cancer, according to a statement from the Dyson Foundation, a family philanthropy.</p>
        <p>She was a clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at Cornell University's medical school and was on the faculty at the University of Illinois College of Medicine.</p>
        <p>Born in 1947, Dr. Dyson received her undergraduate degree from New York University. After attending New York Medical College, she completed an internship at St. Christopher's Hospital in Philadelphia and then did her residency at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dyson said that she concluded from her exposure to patients from Philadelphia's poor neighborhoods  that doctors need some training outside the hospital walls to learn how the community affected patients' health.</p>
        <p>As president of the Dyson Foundation, founded in 1957 by her parents, Margaret and Charles Dyson, she started a program to help hospitals extend their pediatric training to include topics like violence, teenage pregnancy and single-parent homes.</p>
        <p>In addition to her foundation work, Dr. Dyson was the chairwoman of the board of the Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, which sends children with cancer and other illnesses to summer camp.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dyson is survived by her husband, Michael Kramer, a managing editor of The Daily News; her sons, Roberto Hull and Mac Hull; her stepson, Ben Kramer; and three brothers, John S. Dyson of Millbrook, N.Y., an economic adviser to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a former deputy mayor of New York, Robert R. Dyson, chairman and chief executive of Dyson-Kissner-Moran, a privately held investment company in Manhattan, and Peter L. Dyson, president of a private investment firm in Kenilworth, Ill.</p>
