        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, yesterday released their federal income tax returns for the last 10 years, revealing that they depended almost entirely on his Senate salary, supplemented in some years by his wife's earnings as a women's health organizer, and, since 1996, by fees for administering two family trusts.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Party nominee for vice president and his wife reported an adjusted gross income of $336,201 last year and paid 23.5 percent of that, or $78,700, in federal income and self-employment taxes.

        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, yesterday released their federal income tax returns for the last 10 years, revealing that they depended almost entirely on his Senate salary, supplemented in some years by his wife's earnings as a women's health organizer, and, since 1996, by fees for administering two family trusts.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Party nominee for vice president and his wife reported an adjusted gross income of $336,201 last year and paid 23.5 percent of that, or $78,700, in federal income and self-employment taxes. The couple gave $13,804 to charity, all of it in cash. The returns showed a consistent pattern of donating about 3 percent of income each year.</p>
        <p>The couple's income was $107,000 in 1990, the first year for which their full returns were released.</p>
        <p>Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee for vice president, has so far released only the first two pages of his tax returns. Unlike the Liebermans, the Republican vice-presidential nominee and his wife have not made available any of the separate schedules and supporting documents.</p>
        <p>The limited information disclosed earlier this month by Mr. Cheney and his wife, Lynne, showed that their income soared from $258,394 in 1992, the last year when Mr. Cheney was defense secretary, to $4,423,289 in 1999 when he was chief executive of the Halliburton Corporation, the world's largest oil services company, and a director of other firms such as Lockheed Martin, a major defense contractor.</p>
        <p>Last night Dirk Vande Beek, Mr. Cheney's spokesman, said he was trying to ascertain when the Cheneys' full tax returns may be disclosed.</p>
        <p>Senator Lieberman and his wife reported salary income in 1999 of $206,700, $1,738 in taxable interest, $3,083 in dividends, $37,965 in business income from the senator's latest book, $29,216 in capital gains, $10,735 in pension and annuity income and a $15 profit from renting out a condominium they own in their home town of New Haven, Conn.</p>
        <p>The senator also reported $45,000 of income as an author, apparently the senator's share of the advance for ''In Praise of Public Life,'' a slim  volume he wrote with Michael D'Orso that was published in February by Simon &amp; Schuster.</p>
        <p>Since 1996 the Liebermans have also collected fees for administering two family trusts for the benefit of various cousins.</p>
        <p>Last year the senator also reported a $20,000 fee for administering the  Manger Family Trust. He is entitled to a $50,000 annual fee, but Senate ethics rules limit his income from the trust, said his spokeswoman, Jodi Sakol.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lieberman was paid $40,000 by the Faye Manger Trust, which she  administers, but whose investments are decided by an investment adviser.</p>
        <p>The trusts brought the Liebermans administrative fees of $60,000 in 1998, $50,000 in 1997 and $30,000 in 1996, the first year they were paid for these services.</p>
        <p>Last year Mrs. Lieberman was paid $80,000 as an organizer on women's health issues for the American Committee for Shaare-Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>The returns showed that the Liebermans did not follow the advice of many tax professionals on minimizing their taxes. For example, the couple made their charitable gifts with cash rather than giving securities they own that have appreciated in value. And last year they paid a $314 penalty because their combined income tax withholding and estimated payments on their business and investment income fell short of the minimum required under Internal Revenue Service rules.</p>
