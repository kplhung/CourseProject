        <p>Re ''More Patients in Hospice Care, but for Far Fewer Final Days'' (news article, Sept. 18):</p>
        <p>The real problem is not that people and doctors are avoiding hospice care but rather that it so difficult to get appropriate services for people with terminal illnesses, chronic conditions and severe disabilities.</p>
        <p>As a home health nurse, I was especially frustrated with the Medicare and insurance company regulations, which did not allow for long-term monitoring of people with end-stage conditions or severe disabilities but only treatment of acute episodes.</p>
        <p>Managed care has become managed cost, and ''wellness programs'' are being financed as an alternative to needed health care. We need to use our doctors, nurses and health care dollars to meet the needs of each patient more intelligently and compassionately.</p>
