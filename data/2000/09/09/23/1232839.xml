        <p>CONVERSION is an individual experience, but those who have undergone it share in a basic story of how something unexpected worked a great change in their lives, either on the spot or over time.</p>
        <p>For William E. Swing, the bishop of California of the Episcopal Church, it started with a telephone call in 1993 from a United Nations official, an incident that led him into the highly ambitious mission of trying to create a global organization in which religious groups might  work together for peace.</p>
        <p>His caller, the bishop said, merely wanted his help in arranging an interfaith service for United Nations delegates at Grace Cathedral, the elegant neo-Gothic building atop San Francisco's Nob Hill. It was an event to commemorate the United Nations' 50th anniversary in 1995.</p>
        <p>But the request got him thinking. Hours later, Bishop Swing lay in bed reflecting on the fact that while nations had a forum to discuss cooperation, religious faiths had no such thing.</p>
        <p>''There were 40 wars going on in the world that night,'' Bishop Swing said in an interview, ''most of them fueled -- not caused, but fueled -- by religion.''</p>
        <p>When he rose the next morning, Bishop Swing said, he decided he would dedicate himself to trying to create such a forum.</p>
        <p>''It was a conversion, absolutely,'' he said. ''It was a conversion to how we're going to have to live together.''</p>
        <p>Seven years later, he is leading a project  called the United Religions Initiative. It is a work in progress but recently passed a symbolic milestone, bringing together 300 people from around the world who have become involved to sign its charter. The document pledges participants to building bridges among faith groups, respecting one another's religious differences, organizing and making decisions locally and agreeing that no one in the effort will be subjected to religious proselytizing.</p>
        <p>The signing ceremony, in June, was the first in an unusual series of events that have cast a spotlight on how people in different faiths are to relate to one another, an ever more pressing issue in a world made smaller by advances in mass communications.</p>
        <p>In August, 10,000 Protestant evangelists met in Amsterdam under the auspices of the Rev. Billy Graham's organization and issued a declaration that while evangelists must be respectful of other believers, they are obliged to share the Gospel so that those others may hear and convert. In September, the Vatican released its own statement, saying the Christian message that salvation comes only through Jesus is most fully expressed in the Roman Catholic Church, so that Catholic participation in interfaith discussions should consider conversion its ultimate aim.</p>
        <p>On a different note, hundreds of men and women from religious groups worldwide met in New York in late August for the Millennium Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, pledging to work for peace, a reduction in  poverty and the protection of the environment.</p>
        <p>''Everybody,'' said Bishop Swing, ''is wrestling at some level with the same question.''</p>
        <p>The idea of having a global forum for religious groups has been around for a century but has come up against major complicating factors -- questions of authority, how to deal with conflicting ideas about ultimate truth and what to do about proselytism.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, Bishop Swing traveled around the world, seeking ideas on how to proceed from leaders in Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism. The best advice, he said, came from the Swiss Catholic theologian Hans Kung, who pressed him to define his objectives more clearly and also warned him against focusing on the people at the top. The heads of organizations would come to a conference, give a speech and then depart with their entourages -- leaving Bishop Swing with what, Father Kung asked?</p>
        <p>Since then, the bishop and his fellow organizers have focused on enlisting people at the local level, women and men, and being open to those from tribal groups and broad spiritual perspectives, as well as the major faiths.</p>
        <p>The result is decentralized, about 100 of what Bishop Swing calls ''cooperation circles,'' autonomous, interfaith groups around the globe. In 72 hours that overlapped Jan. 1, the groups prayed, marched and did social service projects, all on behalf of peace. The next step, he said, is to create a ''global council'' to support them, by June 2001.</p>
        <p>THE bishop, 64 and married with two adult children, has presided since 1979 over a jurisdiction in the Episcopal Church that encompasses five counties around San Francisco Bay, from Napa Valley to Silicon Valley, a region of vast economic, ethnic and religious diversity.</p>
        <p>In the interview, he spoke again of his meeting with Father Kung, whom he paraphrased as saying there would never be peace among nations without peace among religions, and there would be no peace among religions without dialogue.</p>
        <p>''Everybody gets that,'' Bishop Swing said. ''When I give a talk, in any city, to any age group, they always get that.''</p>
