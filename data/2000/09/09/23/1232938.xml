        <p>Re ''The Whitewater Verdict'' (editorial, Sept. 21):</p>
        <p>You say the Clintons should have been more forthcoming in the multiple investigations. It seemed to me that the Clintons had every right to protect their privacy. It also seemed obvious that Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, had a political agenda. He was egged on by a vindictive Republican Congress whose unambiguous aim was to destroy the president at any cost.</p>

        <p>And the cost was great: tens of millions of dollars and the respect of our government institutions at home and around the world. Maybe the Clintons made some mistakes, but they, and we as a country, were ill served by the cruel circus we endured in the name of justice.</p>
