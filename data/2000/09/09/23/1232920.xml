        <p>The online grocer that was scheduled to open two large warehouses in the South Bronx and Bergen County, N.J., bringing more than 1,900 jobs to the region, said yesterday that it would delay its most immediate expansion plans, including the New Jersey warehouse.</p>
        <p>Technology industry analysts said the delay also cast doubt on plans by the company, Webvan Group Inc., for the Bronx warehouse, which was supposed to provide more than 900 jobs, a project that New York City officials promoted on Thursday. Officials at Webvan would not comment yesterday on the plans for that distribution center, in the former Alexander's department store warehouse in the Hunts Point section.</p>

        <p>The online grocer that was scheduled to open two large warehouses in the South Bronx and Bergen County, N.J., bringing more than 1,900 jobs to the region, said yesterday that it would delay its most immediate expansion plans, including the New Jersey warehouse.</p>
        <p>Technology industry analysts said the delay also cast doubt on plans by the company, Webvan Group Inc., for the Bronx warehouse, which was supposed to provide more than 900 jobs, a project that New York City officials promoted on Thursday. Officials at Webvan would not comment yesterday on the plans for that distribution center, in the former Alexander's department store warehouse in the Hunts Point section.</p>
        <p>The company has been offered $11 million in incentives from economic development officials in New York and more than $3 million from New Jersey for the respective warehouses. Economic development officials in both states said they were hopeful that Webvan would be able continue its plans.</p>
        <p>George T. Shaheen, president and chief executive of Webvan, which is based in San Francisco, said that company officials believed ''that by focusing our key resources on bringing our existing operations to profitability, we will be in a better position to significantly reduce the capital needed to drive our business.''</p>
        <p>Webvan officials said they would postpone the scheduled opening of the New Jersey warehouse, already under construction in Logan Township, for at least six months. The warehouse was to begin operating in 2001 and create 1,000 jobs. Webvan also announced plans to postpone the opening of a warehouse in Glen Burnie, Md. It was supposed to serve the Baltimore and Washington markets.</p>
        <p>Technology analysts said that the move came after signals from Wall Street that investors are not happy with the performance of Webvan, a publicly traded Internet company.</p>
        <p>Like many business-to-customer Internet companies, Webvan has sustained significant losses. Webvan recently acquired HomeGrocer.com, and together, the two companies posted losses of $103.7 million in the first quarter. Much of those losses have come from capital investments into new distribution centers like the $40 million warehouse the company opened in Atlanta in May.</p>
        <p>Webvan's stock climbed to more than $34 per share almost immediately after its initial public offering last November. But the stock has dropped in recent weeks to record lows of about $2 per share. Yesterday, analysts said that they were still optimistic about Webvan's future because of its corporate leadership, technology and the merger with HomeGrocer.com. But they were less positive about expansion in the immediate future.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Merrill Lynch released a bulletin on Webvan's decision to delay its expansion plans, saying that while analysts there supported the notion of conserving capital financing and focusing on profitability, they were ''discouraged by the rescheduled launch of Webvan's two newest'' distribution centers.</p>
        <p>In addition to their concerns that Webvan is operating in areas where there are not enough families willing to spend the money needed to make grocery deliveries profitable, Merrill Lynch analysts have long held that they were most concerned with the company's ability to successfully perform a national rollout and enter new markets.</p>
        <p>Webvan now operates in 9 markets, including San Francisco, Chicago and Atlanta, and was expected to be in 13 metropolitan areas by the end of 2000 and 15 by the end of 2001. ''We now expect Webvan to be in 13 markets by the end of 2001 and believe plans to enter Boston and New York could be permanently delayed,'' Merrill Lynch said in its bulletin.</p>
        <p>The analysts said that the expansions into Boston and the South Bronx would depend on proving that Webvan could come closer to making a profit and, in turn, receive more venture capital financing. ''Part of the promise in owning this stock was that the company would execute on its national rollout, and the failure to deliver is disappointing,'' according to the Merrill Lynch bulletin.</p>
        <p>Shawn Milne, a senior analyst at E*Offering, a San Francisco firm that specializes in technology stocks and has generally been optimistic about Webvan, said that the company was ''clearly in a mode to prove their business model, their economics box, to Wall Street to get more capital.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milne echoed other analysts when he said that Webvan might not find Manhattan too attractive because of logistical problems. But he said that Westchester County, western Long Island and southern Connecticut had potential because of easy access to their highways from the Bronx and because of the family demographics in those areas. Online delivery companies have struggled, in part, because they have not attracted enough families making large orders. Instead, in many areas, like Manhattan, they lose money on each delivery.</p>
        <p>Only Thursday, plans to open the Hunts Point distribution center had economic development officials crowing and politicians, from City Hall to the State Capitol, jockeying for credit. But yesterday's announcement left those same political and government leaders a little wary. City and state officials had given Webvan $11.1 million in incentives, including grants and tax breaks, to bring in jobs and undertake the $40 million renovation of the building.</p>
        <p>The incentives included a $500,000 grant, $6.7 million in city and state wage tax breaks, a $2 million federal grant to train employees and $1.9 million tax abatement for machinery, equipment and renovation.</p>
