        <p>Inge De Bruijn needed only one lap to underscore what has been obvious since May: De Bruijn is the world's finest female sprinter, and her narrow victory in the 50-meter freestyle today gave her a third individual gold medal in these Games.</p>
        <p>The only surprise was that she did not break her own world record, settling for a winning time of 24.32 seconds, 19 hundredths of a second slower than the record she set in Friday's semifinals in this same very fast stretch of Australian water.</p>
        <p>Therese Alshammar of Sweden won the silver medal in 24.51 seconds; the American Dara Torres the bronze in a new personal best of 24.63. While De Bruijn's first two victories in Sydney -- in the 100 butterfly and 100 freestyle -- were utterly convincing, this one was in doubt until the closing meters. Halfway down the pool, Alshammar, who was swimming in Lane 5, had a slight lead over the sleek Dutchwoman, who was thrashing along in Lane 4.</p>
        <p>Torres, in Lane 3, was also pushing De Bruijn hard, but in the end, the Dutch team was celebrating in the stands again and De Bruijn was wearing an expression that showed nearly as much relief as delight.</p>
        <p>''Good job,'' Torres said, swimming over to hug the woman whom she faced and lost in all three of her events in Sydney.</p>
        <p>De Bruijn, 27, had never won an Olympic medal until these Games, but after changing her attitude and address (moving to the United States to train with Tracy Caulkins's former coach Paul Bergen) she has broken or re-set 11 world records in six months. She broke world records in the three events she won here.</p>
        <p>In the second race on the final day of swimming competition at the Olympics, the Australian Grant Hackett defeated his countryman and the two-time defending Olympic champion Kieren Perkins to win the men's 1,500-meter freestyle in 14 minutes 48.33 seconds. The race, one of the most anticipated here because of Perkins's popularity and Australia's history of success in the event, was accompanied by a constant roar from the sellout crowd.</p>
        <p>Perkins finished second in 14:53.59 but still held the world record of 14:41.66.</p>
