        <p>If anyone is the man of the moment, it is Azzedine Alaia, the Tunisian-born designer whose name was whispered throughout the Helmut Lang show and who is the subject of a retrospective that opened last night at the SoHo branch of the Guggenheim Museum.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alaia is one of fashion's great creators, as well as a committed maverick, and he has recently signed an agreement with Prada that seems completely consistent with his status as a designer who doesn't believe in seasons or normal delivery schedules.</p>
        <p>The deal that he worked out with Patrizio Bertelli, Prada's chief executive and the husband of the designer Miuccia Prada, essentially involves artistic patronage rather than conventional business financing. ''I still own 100 percent of my name,'' Mr. Alaia said on Thursday. The main point of the partnership, he explained, is to establish a permanent Alaia archive, not unlike the one recently opened by Yves Saint Laurent for its treasures. Mr. Alaia has one of the most complete archives in the business, and it includes clothing by other designers, like Charles James and Adrian.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alaia conceded that the deal with Prada is unusual. He said two other fashion companies approached him about expanding his business, but that Mr. Bertelli was the only executive who appreciated the unconventional way he works. Prada also will help his company with distribution and may produce shoes and bags, but he said his clothes will continue to be made in factories he has used for years. ''The contract doesn't say anything about seasons,'' Mr. Alaia said proudly. ''And you know I don't care about money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bertelli could not be reached for comment, but there is no doubt that having an association with Mr. Alaia brings additional prestige to Prada. It certainly made Mr. Alaia buoyant. ''If there's a problem,'' he said with a twinkle in his eye, ''I'll phone Miuccia.''</p>
