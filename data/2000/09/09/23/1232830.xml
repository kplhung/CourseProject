        <p>From the far reaches of the grandstand, they called out to Cheryl Haworth, screeching her nickname, ''Fun.''</p>
        <p>It is very serious business, lifting more than 300 pounds in the air, but when Haworth appeared on the small, rectangular platform that serves as weight lifting's field of play, her friends and family couldn't help themselves. ''Do it, Fun,'' they shouted.</p>
        <p>Haworth, the 17-year-old, 300-pound high school senior, who moves people's cars as a prank, heard them even if she did not acknowledge them.</p>
        <p>''It's not all that easy to go out on that stage all by yourself,'' she said later, admitting to being nervous. ''With them around, I don't feel like I am.''</p>
        <p>There are few settings at the Olympics that are more tense than at weight lifting, where an audience sits theater-style,  staring at powerful athletes stretching the limits of their strength.</p>
        <p>Once the lifter approaches the weight, it is an atmosphere that engenders a silent reverence -- the squeaks of the chalked lifter's hands on the bar heard throughout the arena. What follows is an explosion of noise, led first by the cries, shouts and groans of the competitor, and usually matched by the crowd.</p>
        <p>In this environment, Haworth has found a home. As she said last week, ''The Olympics are not just for the small athletes.''</p>
        <p>Today, Haworth saw that as the message within her bronze-medal performance in the superheavyweight division. And she happily accepted the mantle for people, who, as she said, ''aren't a perfect size 4.''</p>
        <p>Winning the gold was Ding Meiyuan of China, a two-time world champion, and the silver went to Agata Wrobel of Poland. Ding set the world record in both the snatch and the clean and jerk portions of the competition. The two are combined with the total weight determining the winner.</p>
        <p>Ding lifted 300 kilograms, more than 660 pounds, after lifting 135 kilograms in the snatch. Wrobel lifted 295 kilograms and Haworth set a personal high at 270 kilograms (125 kilograms in the snatch).</p>
        <p>Given her age and lack of international experience, Haworth had realistically not set a goal above the bronze medal.</p>
        <p>''One I got here and saw the scene,'' she said, ''I didn't want to go home without a medal.''</p>
        <p>''I hope I can make people realize that every human body is different and can do so many different things,'' Haworth said after the competition. ''Everybody is good at something and too often people think because they aren't the same size or shape as some other people that they'll never find what they're good at. They think they're finished and give up.''</p>
        <p>Haworth's story produced several appearances on national television before the Olympics and her riveting performance today, even if it was for third place, will only enhance her appeal. She has a way of talking about herself with a mix of humor, panache and compassion.</p>
        <p>''Look, I do know what it's like to be thin,'' Haworth said. ''I have two skinny sisters, why, one can't be more than 125 pounds. So I know we're not that different.''</p>
        <p>After her tonsils and adenoids were removed as a 6-year-old, Haworth began to gain weight. Once a sickly child, her appetite expanded and her mother, Sheila, happy to have a healthy daughter again, fed her.</p>
        <p>Haworth became a weight-lifting phenomenon just four years ago when she casually walked into a gym in her hometown of Savannah, Ga., hoping to become stronger for her softball career. She was 13 at the time, and three years later, qualified for the world championships.</p>
        <p>The 5-foot-9 Haworth can also run the 40-yard dash in 5.5 seconds, which is far from slow, and has the flexibility to do a full split.</p>
        <p>She didn't know exactly how she would react today in Sydney.</p>
        <p>''I may look calm and sound together,'' Haworth said. ''But if you really know me, you know I'm really a 17-year-old.''</p>
        <p>When Haworth made her last lift, pushing the bar with 321 pounds over her head, the noise from her personal rooting section drowned out Haworth's own shouts. The crowd saw the smile on her face beneath the bowing bar.</p>
        <p>''I was really happy,'' she said. ''Because that was really fun.''</p>
