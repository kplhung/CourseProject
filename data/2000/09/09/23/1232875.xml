        <p>''It's not about chasing headlines,'' say the television and billboard advertisements on which Roger Kahn has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, and around the suburbs and farms of northwest Georgia there is nothing cryptic about the meaning of his campaign slogan.</p>
        <p>His target is obvious to local residents, who have seen headlines like these for years: ''Bob Barr, 'Attack Dog for Impeachment,' Finds Himself Leading the Pack.'' ''Even Before Monica Lewinsky, Bob Barr Had Impeachment on His Mind.'' ''Barr Blasts Army for Allowing Wiccan Celebration at Texas Base.'' ''Barr blasts E.P.A. for Promoting Homosexual Behavior.''</p>
        <p>But for Bob Barr, the relentless Republican congressman from Georgia's Seventh District, even skeptical headlines have been a welcome byproduct of his crusades against liberal orthodoxy. (The Environmental Protection Agency salvo came after the agency allowed members of same-sex relationships to receive family leave.) During six years in office, he has not simply marched into difficult ideological battles others avoided; he has created them, and brought home the results to a district that has generally appreciated his bellicosity through two re-election campaigns.</p>
        <p>This year, Mr. Kahn, a wealthy businessman and a Democrat, is hoping that voters have begun to tire of Mr. Barr's whirling fury, and is spending his own money freely to mount the most significant challenge Mr. Barr has faced. But Mr. Barr is hardly edging away from his record. While national Republicans are loath to utter the word ''impeachment,'' Mr. Barr is proud of his role as an impeachment manager and designated antagonist of official Washington.</p>
        <p>''The district was very clearly in support of the impeachment effort, and remained very clear in support during the entire process,'' Mr. Barr said in a recent interview. ''People would stop me in the airport, stop me in the grocery store, the gas station, writing and faxing in, all in encouragement. In fact, the most consistent thing I hear from the people in the Seventh District is, don't change.''</p>
        <p>But the Seventh District, which widens from the western suburbs of Atlanta to the Alabama border, is not quite the same solidly conservative turf that first elected Mr. Barr as part of the 1994 Republican revolution. Atlanta's incessant growth has brought to the district a steady stream of newcomers who may be mostly Republican but are not always as passionately right-of-center as their representative.</p>
        <p>Gov. Roy E. Barnes, a Democrat, did well here in 1998 (he lives in the district), and the state representative from Mr. Barr's hometown of Smyrna recently left the Republican Party to become a Democrat. Mr. Barr's winning percentage slipped from 58 percent in 1996 to 55 percent in 1998; his little-known opponent that year spent $14,000 but got 45 percent of the vote and almost carried suburban Cobb County.</p>
        <p>''I think Barr probably viewed his district as safer than it was, and he got a scare,'' said Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia. ''I wouldn't bet against him, but he's such a polarizer that he always attracts opposition, and when they're credible, the contests can be reasonably close.'' A poll of 500 likely voters conducted this week by the Kahn campaign showed Mr. Barr with 47 percent, Mr. Kahn with 41 percent and 12 percent undecided. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kahn, a former liquor distributor who owns a company that broadcasts Professional Golfers Association tournaments on radio, took a look at the 1998 numbers and decided Mr. Barr was vulnerable. Mr. Kahn, who has no electoral experience, moved back to Georgia from Florida, where he had retired, bought a cattle farm in the northern part of the district, and began organizing a challenge. He has lent $1.1 million to his campaign and has raised another $800,000, much of which he has spent on television advertisements.</p>
        <p>In his advertisements and speeches, Mr. Kahn, 54, depicts himself as a conservative businessman considerably to the right of Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, one who supports education reform and gun rights, a touchstone in the district given Mr. Barr's membership on the board of the National Rifle Association. Mr. Kahn says he does not know whether he would have voted to impeach Mr. Clinton, and criticizes Mr. Barr not so much for the content of his crusades but for their quixotism, and the time they take from the district's business.</p>
        <p>''He has his own personal agenda, and it brings nothing to the Seventh District,'' Mr. Kahn said recently. ''He was so focused on getting rid of witchcraft at Fort Hood, but that same week, Lockheed announced 2,800 job cuts in Marietta. That's where he should have been focused.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barr, 51, responded that he tried to eliminate witchcraft at the  Army base in Texas because a constituent complained about it, just as another voter's concerns led him to introduce the Defense of Marriage Act, a bill that allowed states to refuse recognition of same-sex marriages, which was signed by President Clinton in 1996. Mr. Barr said Mr. Kahn seemed to be suggesting government interference in Lockheed Martin, the aerospace company that is a major district employer, and that stance proves he is a liberal.</p>
        <p>''If he favors government control of business, then he's clearly not a conservative, so he must be a liberal,'' said Mr. Barr, flashing his trademark dour glare. ''That would be very consistent with his intention of voting for Al Gore and accepting money from abortion groups. Now that I think about it, he's definitely a liberal.''</p>
        <p>Last Saturday, at a fund-raising barbecue where he appeared with Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, Mr. Barr began referring to Mr. Kahn as a ''carpetbagger liquor dealer from Buckhead,'' a reference to the exclusive Atlanta residential district where Mr. Kahn used to live. While Mr. Kahn may seem a bit uncomfortable in the weekend-farmer outfits he wears in his advertisements, he has a somewhat stronger claim to the South as an Atlanta native than does Mr. Barr, born in Iowa City.</p>
        <p>The exchange indicates that the race is likely to get more personal in the weeks ahead, especially once Mr. Barr's television advertisements begin running in mid-October. Mr. Barr has raised about $2.3 million, a third of which came from outside Georgia, and tends to run his campaigns with the same cannonball fervor of his Congressional life. ''I don't mind a good fight at all,'' he said. ''I have a responsibility to stand up for certain things, and the other side, they just resent anyone who stands up to the liberal agenda. Well, I'm certainly not going to back down now.''</p>
