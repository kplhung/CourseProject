        <p>Six months ago, the United States team just scraped into the Olympic debut of women's water polo.</p>
        <p>Tonight, the United States defeated the Netherlands, the world's top-ranked team, 6-5, in the semifinals and will face Australia in Saturday night's final. The gold medal game will be played at the 18,000-seat Sydney International Aquatic Center, which has proved to be a hot pool for American swimmers.</p>
        <p>The United States team failed to gain entry for the Olympics at a first qualifier in Winnipeg, Manitoba, early this year, then earned its way into the Games with a late goal against Hungary in a last-chance contest in April at Palermo, Italy.</p>
        <p>But tonight the Americans made their statement when they took an early 3-1 lead, lost it to counterattacks that gave the Netherlands, the world champion, a 5-3 margin, then scored three straight goals to gain an upset victory. Australia beat the Russian Federation, 7-6.</p>
        <p>The United States squad's veteran, Maureen O'Toole, 39, scored the first two American goals. ''This is exciting, incredible and fun,'' she said. ''All our hard work has paid off.''</p>
        <p>In the six-nation Olympic round robin here the Americans were seeded at the bottom. But they have been steeled by their rugged road to Sydney.</p>
        <p>''We've had lots of difficult situations but have come back,'' Coralie Simmons said. The task for the Americans in the final, however, is made even harder because the status of Heather Moody, who scored the winning goal against the Netherlands five minutes before the end, is uncertain. She was helped from the pool tonight three minutes before the end bleeding profusely, apparently from a kick to the bridge of her nose.</p>
