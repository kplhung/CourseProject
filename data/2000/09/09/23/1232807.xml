        <p>Late in Oscar Micheaux's 1925 silent film classic ''Body and Soul,'' there is a scene in which Paul Robeson, playing an escaped convict posing as the minister of a Southern black church, rouses his adoring congregation with a sermon that sparks tumultuous jubilance. Gesticulating wildly while sneaking swigs from a flask under the pulpit, this cunning clerical impostor who goes by the name the Rt. Rev. Isaiah Jenkins becomes so carried away with his own charisma that he accidentally knocks one of the deacons to the floor.</p>

        <p>Late in Oscar Micheaux's 1925 silent film classic ''Body and Soul,'' there is a scene in which Paul Robeson, playing an escaped convict posing as the minister of a Southern black church, rouses his adoring congregation with a sermon that sparks tumultuous jubilance. Gesticulating wildly while sneaking swigs from a flask under the pulpit, this cunning clerical impostor who goes by the name the Rt. Rev. Isaiah Jenkins becomes so carried away with his own charisma that he accidentally knocks one of the deacons to the floor.</p>
        <p>''Body and Soul'' was Robeson's movie debut at the age of 27, and the only word to describe his screen presence is ''blazing.''</p>
        <p>When accompanied by stirring live music, this scene is one of several moments that transcend the limitations of the silent movie genre. At a recent press preview of ''Body and  Soul,'' which the New York Film Festival is showing twice tomorrow at Avery Fisher Hall, with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra playing an original score by the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon, the images and music achieved an astounding synergy.</p>
        <p>As the members of the orchestra shouted calls and responses above a brassy gospel theme, the movie  stopped seeming like a silent film with musical accompaniment and turned into a revival meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon's score, a sprawling, deliberately rough-hewn orchestral suite rooted in the blues but incorporating gospel, vintage work songs and occasional hints of a more modern swing, made an enlightening accompaniment to Micheaux's old-fashioned melodrama. Robeson's phony preacher is a traditional hissable villain who  drinks, gambles, steals, lusts and uses his man-of-the-cloth status to destroy a forlorn young woman named Isabelle (Mercedes Gilbert).</p>
        <p>The daughter of Martha Jane (Julia  Theresa Russell), one of the congregation's most trusting and devoted parishioners, Isabelle is also being wooed by the preacher's honorable but penniless twin brother, Sylvester (also Mr. Robeson), an aspiring inventor. A good twin and a bad twin? ''Body and Soul'' is a silent film after all, and the movie employs the melodramatic formulas of the period.)</p>
        <p>After seducing Isabelle, to feverish music, then stealing her and mother's life savings from the family Bible,  Jenkins laughingly sneers to Isabelle that her mother would never believe her if she told the truth. Leaving an ambiguous note tucked in the Bible, Isabelle flees to Atlanta with $10 he hands her and eventually comes to a sad end, but not before a tearful reunion with her mother.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon's full-length score, commissioned for the orchestra to open the 10th season of Jazz at Lincoln Center, is a sprawling, folkloric tapestry that immeasurably deepens what is shown on the screen. Rooted in the blues, the trumpet, trombone and sax-oriented orchestrations, augmented here and there by hand claps, knee slaps and spontaneous shouts and chants, lend the melodrama the resonance of a historical fable that has been passed down through the generations.</p>
        <p>The music is so vigorous, funny and loquacious, it often seems to take the place of speech and lucidly portray the characters' feelings and interactions. At the same time, it has feel of a raucous running commentary carried on by chattering Greek choruses.</p>
        <p>Without indulging in the more cartoonish excesses of silent film emoting, Robeson radiates the roguish charm and dangerous looming ferocity of a master con man with a scary streak of violence. Like his singing, Robeson's acting has stature. It is larger than life.</p>
        <p>BODY AND SOUL</p>
        <p>Produced and directed by Oscar Micheaux; score by Wycliffe Gordon, performed live by the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis; produced by the Micheaux Film Corporation. Running time: 86 minutes. This film is not rated. Shown tomorrow at 5 and 8 p.m. at Avery Fisher Hall at the 38th New York Film Festival.</p>
        <p>WITH: Paul Robeson (the Rt. Rev. Isaiah Jenkins/Sylvester), Lawrence Chenault (Curly Hinds), Mercedes Gilbert (Isabelle), Marshall Rodgers (Juke Joint Proprietor) and Julia Theresa Russell (Martha Jane).</p>
