        <p>Gerald A. Jones was an 18-year-old with a robbery conviction. He stuck a gun in a woman's face and stole her watch. That was last summer. This summer, he was released from jail under a special program that gives young first offenders a second chance. He was placed under the most stringent form of probation, house arrest.</p>
        <p>But in a blunder that is thus far unexplained, the electronic equipment that was supposed to monitor Mr. Jones failed, and worse yet, that failure somehow went undetected for months by his probation officer.</p>
        <p>And that is why, investigators said yesterday, Mr. Jones was able to join his friends on Lafayette Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, on the night of Sept. 6. It was a night of mourning and drinking in memory of Moleak Jackson, a 22-year-old known to the police as a gang member and to his friends as a neighborhood basketball legend who had died of a heart attack while playing a pickup game a few days earlier.</p>
        <p>Sometime that night -- and only hours after Moleak Jackson's wake had ended -- another man from the neighborhood, Earl Pratt, made a disparaging remark about Mr. Jackson. Accordingly, Mr. Jackson's friends gathered outside Mr. Pratt's apartment at 950 Lafayette Avenue, drunkenly taunting him to come outside, residents said. Mr. Pratt stayed put, but his 20-year-old girlfriend, Esmee Nicole St. Luc, emerged just after 11 p.m.</p>
        <p>It was then, the police said, that Mr. Jones once again put a gun to a woman's face.</p>
        <p>This time, prosecutors say, he pulled the trigger.</p>
        <p>The bullet, fired from a .380 semiautomatic, entered Ms. St. Luc's right temple. She was pronounced dead at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center about 45 minutes later.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Jones has been charged with second-degree murder, and the city's Department of Probation has begun an audit of the monitoring procedures for about 200 other offenders who are being held under house arrest, said Jack Ryan, a spokesman for the agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones, whose arrest was first reported yesterday in Newsday, had been supervised under a program called Start, or the Short Term Alternative to Remand Treatment. In Start, an offender serves six months in jail and another six months under house arrest. A judge then assesses the offender's performance and determines whether prison or more probation is the appropriate sentence.</p>
        <p>''I do want to emphasize that this was very unusual,'' Mr. Ryan said.  ''We have not seen in the Start program any other failure like this where the probation officer just did not take care of his case.''</p>
        <p>Specifically, Mr. Ryan said the officer did not take action to correct the failure of Mr. Jones's monitoring equipment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones wore an electronic bracelet around his ankle 24 hours a day, and that bracelet was to have sent a signal to a box attached to his apartment's telephone line. In theory, the system would send a signal to the Probation Department if Mr. Jones left his house or tried to tamper with his bracelet. But in fact, Mr. Ryan said yesterday, the system malfunctioned the day after it was installed on June 27.</p>
        <p>A technician was sent to repair it, but the malfunction persisted, for reasons that are still unclear. According to Mr. Ryan, the officer supervising Mr. Jones should have noted the malfunction, and then have done something to correct the problem. The officer, Elmer Anderson, has been suspended. Mr. Ryan said the Probation Department would be seeking to fire him.</p>
        <p>As for the city's monitoring equipment, which is provided and maintained by BI Inc. of Colorado, Mr. Ryan said there had been minor problems in the past. ''With electronic equipment like this you can't have it be 100 percent,'' he said. ''But it's been reliable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones pleaded guilty to first-degree robbery on Feb. 18. He could have been sentenced to 12 1/2 to 25 years in prison, but Judge Joseph Silverman sentenced him to the Start program over the objections of the office of the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, officials said.</p>
        <p>Michael L. Pesce, the administrative judge for State Supreme Court in Brooklyn and Staten Island, defended Judge Silverman, calling Start ''a very good program.''</p>
        <p>''But as with all programs,'' he said, ''they are not fail-safe.''</p>
        <p>The Start program includes routine home visits, office visits with the probation officer and random drug testing. In the case of Mr. Jones, he attended counseling each week and he was allowed to work during the day for a moving company.</p>
        <p>Ita Parnass, the lawyer who is representing Mr. Jones in the murder case, declined to comment yesterday. But Mr. Jones's older brother, Kimmiha Scott, 21, said that Mr. Jones had denied any involvement in the shooting and instead blames others in the neighborhood for lying about him. Mr. Scott said his brother, a high school dropout whose mother died of AIDS in 1995, had committed himself to completing his house arrest.</p>
        <p>''He made all of his appointments,'' Mr. Scott said. ''He made all of his programs.''</p>
        <p>Ms. St. Luc was born in Alaska and attended schools in Georgia and Germany before her family moved to New York City several years ago. The oldest of three children, she lived with her mother, a bus driver, on Stuyvesant Avenue just a few blocks from where she was killed.</p>
        <p>''Though some saw her as complicated, those who knew her understood her intentions were simple,'' her family wrote in an obituary published in a memorial book. ''She was a free spirit, enthusiastic about life, as she allowed herself to be optimistic throughout all of life's ups and downs.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon, her younger brother, Guy Jr., 11, stood on the front stoop of his mother's apartment, recalling how his mother awakened him and told him that his sister was gone.</p>
        <p>''She always used to make me laugh,'' Guy said, fidgeting in his school uniform. He looked off, his voice almost a whisper. ''She always used to make me laugh.''</p>
