        <p>Mighty, one of the favorites for the Triple Crown until he was injured last spring, ended a five-month absence from racing yesterday when he ran fifth in a seven-horse field in an allowance race at Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>It was his first start since April, when he ran seventh in the Blue Grass Stakes, just one month after he outran More Than Ready and Captain Steve in the Louisiana Derby.

        <p>Mighty, one of the favorites for the Triple Crown until he was injured last spring, ended a five-month absence from racing yesterday when he ran fifth in a seven-horse field in an allowance race at Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>It was his first start since April, when he ran seventh in the Blue Grass Stakes, just one month after he outran More Than Ready and Captain Steve in the Louisiana Derby. But an injury forced him to skip the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes, and his trainer, Frank Brothers, said yesterday that he was disappointed by his colt's performance in his comeback race.</p>
        <p>The winner, Top Official, trained by Leah Gyarmati with Diane Nelson riding, ran the mile and a sixteenth in 1:42 2/5 and paid $26.20 for a $2 bet to win. He finished a nose in front of Uncle Abbie, with Corroborator third.</p>
        <p>Belmont expects a more significant comeback today when Fusaichi Pegasus, who won the Kentucky Derby and was second in the Preakness, returns after a four-month layoff. He will face six rivals in the Jerome Handicap in a prep race for the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic and a shot at the title Horse of the Year.</p>
