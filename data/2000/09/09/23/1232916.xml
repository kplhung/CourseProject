        <p>He is the long reliever, and he pitched to only three batters on Tuesday night. One hit and two walks were all Mets Manager Bobby Valentine needed to see from Pat Mahomes, the struggling right-hander.</p>
        <p>The Mets lost that game to Atlanta, 12-4, and Valentine seethed afterward in a meeting with his players. Mahomes said Valentine never mentioned him by name, but he did not have to. Mahomes felt terrible, as he has for a month and a half.</p>
        <p>''There was no message needed,'' Mahomes said. ''I'm not doing my job, and it's frustrating enough as it is by myself. My job is to come in and give us a chance to win the ballgame.''</p>
        <p>He failed that night in what has become a trend. Mahomes has allowed at least one run in 13 of his 15 games since July 31, with an 11.10 earned run average. He has more walks than strikeouts in that span, and the numbers in those categories are nearly similar for the season (65 walks, 69 strikeouts).</p>
        <p>After a poor August, Mahomes went home to Tyler, Tex., on an off-day, trying to clear his mind of negative thoughts. He also said he had more confidence in his fastball. But on Sept. 1, the Cardinals' Jim Edmonds hit one of those fastballs for a game-ending home run. The rest of the month has been just as unkind.</p>
        <p>''I know what it is,'' Mahomes said. ''I'm not throwing strikes. When you don't throw strikes, you don't give yourself a chance.''</p>
        <p>Now, Mahomes may not get the chance to join his teammates on the postseason roster. At the end of August, the Mets were so confident in their 11 pitchers that they took no measures to gain flexibility for the postseason. Barring injury, if the Mets want to carry 11 pitchers, Mahomes must be one of them.</p>
        <p>A starting pitcher like Glendon Rusch or Bobby J. Jones could be a long reliever in the postseason, and the Mets could carry only 10 pitchers. This would allow them to get one position player with an uncertain spot -- like Joe McEwing or Matt Franco -- on the roster.</p>
        <p>General Manager Steve Phillips has said that the Mets are leaning toward carrying 14 position players and 11 pitchers. He was vague tonight about his plans when asked if he had considered carrying only 10 pitchers.</p>
        <p>''We haven't had much discussion about that,'' Phillips said. ''We have time to discuss it. It's a wait-and-see. It's all premature right now.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Mets' coaching staff will continue to work with Mahomes on mechanics and regaining good location on his fastball. Valentine has asked team trainers if Mahomes is healthy, and has been assured that he is. Perhaps, Valentine said, simply putting the regular season behind him could help Mahomes.</p>
        <p>''Maybe turning the page on a season might light a guy's fire,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Tickets on Sale</p>
        <p>Tickets for the Mets' first and second home games in the National League division series will go on sale by telephone only at 10 a.m. today. Each fan is allowed a maximum of four tickets to one game only, and the dates and times of the games are to be determined. The phone number for the Mets' ticket office is (718) 507-TIXX.</p>
