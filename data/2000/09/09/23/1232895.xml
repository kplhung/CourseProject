        <p>Did President Clinton decide to dip into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve today to protect Vice President Al Gore? Or does he truly believe it will reverse a jump in oil prices that could hurt millions of Americans and threaten the country's remarkable prosperity?</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's aides insisted today, not surprisingly, that the decision was made on policy grounds alone. But none denied that it had the pleasant side effect of casting Mr. Gore into the limelight as the man who tried to save American homeowners from a winter of sky-high heating bills.</p>
        <p>It may be weeks -- maybe even after the Nov. 7 election -- before anyone knows whether the unusual intervention in the oil markets announced today will have a lasting economic impact.</p>
        <p>But politics moves a lot faster than oil tankers do.</p>
        <p>And so Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore are exploiting one of the ultimate perks of incumbency -- the power to move both oil and markets -- in hopes of lifting an economic burden on millions of American households while outflanking a Republican ticket that Mr. Gore has already charged with being a tool of big oil.</p>
        <p>''Look, no one here is going to argue that we made this decision in a vacuum -- Gore's people were right in the room,'' one senior administration official said today. ''But just because it helps Al doesn't mean it was the wrong policy choice. A week ago we were going the other way. But if you looked at the markets in the past few days, it was clear we couldn't sit and do nothing.''</p>
        <p>It was particularly clear to Mr. Gore, who called President Clinton on Tuesday and told him that he was going to give a speech later in the week calling on the president to tap the reserves. In public, Mr. Gore said he was seeking only a small intervention in the oil markets -- starting with five million barrels, roughly a quarter of the amount of oil that the United States consumes in a single day. But he was clearly looking for more.</p>
        <p>''He left the president a lot of room to do a little or a lot,'' one of Mr. Gore's aides said today. But the message was clear: He had to do something.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Clinton did in the end was split the difference between two cabinet members who had been arguing over the subject for weeks. One was Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who told the president in a memorandum earlier this month that he should flood the market with 60 million barrels, or more than 10 percent of the reserve.</p>
        <p>That prompted a sharp retort from Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. Mr. Summers viewed Mr. Richardson's proposal as foolish, saying it would ''set a dangerous precedent'' by using the reserves to manipulate prices rather than act as an insurance policy against real disruptions in supply.</p>
        <p>The sale might have a modest effect on prices, Mr. Summers argued, but it would not last long. The markets would quickly conclude that the United States did not dare pull the same trick twice -- because it would not want to exhaust its emergency reserves or give Mr. Gore's Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, the chance to make a credible argument that the administration was endangering America's energy security in an effort to get Mr. Gore elected.</p>
        <p>But that is exactly what Mr. Bush charged on Thursday, after Mr. Gore's announcement calling for the release of the reserves. He repeated the charge today, saying, ''The Strategic Petroleum Reserve needs to be used in the case of war, in case of major disruption of supply. This is an administration that has had no energy plan.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush may have a hard time arguing that a plan that keeps 95 percent of the stocks in the ground, unused, poses a major threat. And today, the White House was trotting out members of its national security team to assure reporters that they had reviewed the plans and thought it posed no problem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson went a step further, arguing that because he was ''swapping'' oil rather than selling it -- that is, releasing it in return for commitments from oil companies to put even more back in -- the result would be a ''further increase in the nation's protection against potential or actual energy supply disruptions.''</p>
        <p>He is right, as long as any disruptions come after the supplies are replenished. It seems unlikely, however, that he has convinced Saddam Hussein, who has been verbally threatening Kuwait in recent days, to sign on to that strategy.</p>
        <p>The other unanswered question is whether Mr. Summers's warnings of last week -- he has since revised his view, he says, because the oil market has tightened further -- will prove prescient.</p>
        <p>That depends in part on how well the administration conducts its behind-the-scenes diplomacy in the Middle East. Nations in the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries could easily nullify the effects of the administration's move by cutting their own production by the same million barrels a day.</p>
        <p>''We think we can head that off,'' one administration official said.</p>
        <p>If so, the announcement today could have a significant impact.</p>
        <p>In the oil markets, as in the currency markets, just a bit of additional supply can have a much-magnified effect on price -- especially if traders believe that Washington is ready to act again.</p>
        <p>That is what Mr. Summers and other economic officials around the world were betting this morning when they intervened in the international currency markets to support the lagging Euro, the European currency, and it is what Mr. Gore is betting with his oil initiative.</p>
        <p>But the price effect can prove temporary if traders conclude that the chance of additional releases of oil is remote.</p>
        <p>One administration official noted today that Mr. Summers, Mr. Richardson and others, in a conference call on Thursday night, had settled on releasing 30 million barrels because ''it was big enough to really move the markets, and yet small enough to make a convincing case that we could do more if we have to.''</p>
        <p>No doubt Mr. Gore will be on the stump suggesting that he can do plenty more if he needs to.</p>
        <p>''I reject the agenda of those who say, 'Don't even offer a plan, do nothing about it,' '' Mr. Gore said today in Pennsylvania. ''We are not helpless. We can act. We have tools at our disposal.''</p>
        <p>That is, incumbents do.</p>
