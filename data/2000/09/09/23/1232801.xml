        <p>The earliest days of the 2000 Olympic boxing tournament were full of success and ever-escalating medal predictions for the United States boxing team. Today was a sobering day of defeat and default.</p>
        <p>In a close and mildly controversial fight, the United States team lost one of its gold medal contenders when Brian Viloria, the reigning light flyweight world champion from Hawaii, was outpointed by Brahim Asloum of France, 6-4.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, the United States lightweight David Jackson was eliminated from the tournament, disqualified for not making the 132-pound weight limit for his division. In between those two setbacks, the American middleweight Jeff Lacy did advance to the third round with his second successive strong performance, outpointing Pawel Kakietek of Poland, 21-7.</p>
        <p>Viloria had defeated Asloum when the two met in the quarterfinals of the world championships last year, winning comfortably by decision. Today, Viloria said Asloum displayed a different defense in their 106-pound fight, keeping his hands in front of his face in a peek-a-boo style.</p>
        <p>It made Asloum harder to hit, except to the body, which is where Viloria attacked repeatedly. But as is often the case in amateur boxing, the judges did not award Viloria a single point for a body blow. The fight remained close until the end, when Viloria, more desperate to score, left himself open for the two punches that led to the 2-point difference in the fight.</p>
        <p>''If they had counted the body shots, we would have been way ahead,'' the United States team's coach, Tom Mustin, said. ''I've said it before, they don't count them for whatever reason. And he threw a lot of great body shots.''</p>
        <p>Mustin did not say that he thought Viloria won the fight. ''You have to give credit where credit is due,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Viloria, 19, said he was disappointed but felt he would regroup.</p>
        <p>''I've got a lot of boxing left,'' he said, referring to his future career. ''I thought they didn't credit me for some body shots. I was pretty surprised to hear I wasn't leading the fight after the first and second rounds.''</p>
        <p>The five judges registered only one scored punch per round for each fighter in the first two rounds and gave Asloum 2 points to Viloria's 1 in the third round. Halfway through the fourth and final round, Asloum padded his lead with a right hand to Viloria's head.</p>
        <p>Viloria then grew more desperate, scoring once but leaving himself open for a late-round counterpunch that sealed the decision for Asloum.</p>
        <p>Jackson, who missed the 132-pound limit by three pounds today, has had problems with his weight before. Having retired from boxing in 1998, he had to lose more than 35 pounds to get back in the ring last year. But he made the weight for his first-round fight last Monday, and that made Mustin believe Jackson would be able to remain at that weight level for the rest of the tournament.</p>
        <p>''Then the day after his first fight, he was four pounds over,'' Mustin said. ''We were working on it and some of his teammates even offered to help him with his road work and do what they could to help. We had a sports nutritionist talk to him and even a sports psychologist because sometimes guys who lose a lot of weight get kind of down.</p>
        <p>''He just couldn't make it.''</p>
        <p>With Lacy's victory as the only bright spot, Mustin was looking forward to Saturday night when his other top gold medal favorite, the world champion featherweight Ricardo Juarez fights along with his teammates Jermain Taylor and Calvin Brock.</p>
        <p>''It was a disappointing day,'' Mustin said. ''But we've got nine fighters still in it.''</p>
