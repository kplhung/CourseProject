        <p>Joe Torre insists there is no uneasiness surrounding the Yankees. Sure, they want to win and they expect to win, but they are not tight about losing games in September as if they are suddenly imitating the Mets. Walk around the clubhouse, Torre politely advised. Do the Yankees look nervous?</p>
        <p>Maybe not, but maybe they should be concerned after Denny Neagle gave an awful performance in the most important game he has pitched for the Yankees in stumbling to the Tigers, 9-6, at Yankee Stadium last night.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have lost six straight games and they are not even crawling toward a postseason spot that has been theirs for months. They have stopped dead at the worst time, their offense has disappeared and they look much more vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Ten days ago, the Yankees were cruising, the season seemed to be dragging and Torre fielded questions about the inevitable trip to the postseason.</p>
        <p>Torre answered the hypothetical questions reluctantly and jokingly said that he would blame reporters for asking him about the postseason if the Yankees continued to flounder. Even Torre laughed at his remark, but that was before the Yankees lost again and looked unsightly in the process.</p>
        <p>''Sure,'' Torre acknowledged, when asked if this funk was difficult to fathom. ''You know that it's possible. That's why I'm always cautious about looking too far down the road. You don't want to lose your edge. We're looking to get it back.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees are not in a perilous situation yet, but it is probably one or two more losses from turning tenuous in Yankeeland. The Devil Rays defeated the Blue Jays, 3-2, yesterday so the Yankees maintained a four-and-a-half-game lead over Toronto with 10 games remaining. It would take a gargantuan collapse for them to miss the postseason. It would take another week like this one, which the Yankees have shown, in graphic detail, can happen.</p>
        <p>In addition to making the postseason, the Yankees do not want to hobble into October, either. One of the trademarks of the Yankees since Torre became manager in 1996 is that they have been solid going into the postseason. Torre has usually taken the last 10 days or so to play his starters regularly and the results have been stellar.</p>
        <p>The Yankees were 9-5 to finish 1999, 10-4 to complete 1998, 11-3 to close 1997 and 8-6 (and 13-7) at the end of 1996 and they won World Series titles in three of those four seasons. The Yankees would have to win  eight of their last 10 games to go 8-6 in the last two weeks, merely matching their worst record over the last five years. They do not have much time to breed confidence.</p>
        <p>''Four days is enough to get it,'' Torre said. ''Something about going into the postseason cleans the slate and starts over again.''</p>
        <p>Torre is being very optimistic to think that the Yankees can regain their groove in a mere four days. They have three excellent starters in Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Orlando Hernandez, but they had not lost six in a row in three years. Are we supposed to believe that the Yankees can rebound for four days and then soar in October? There are fewer believers today after an ugly yesterday, which included Paul O'Neill going 0 for 4 with four strikeouts and Jeff Nelson and Ted Lilly inexplicably failing to cover bases in the ninth.</p>
        <p>''I've always said that the best teams make the playoffs because you play 162 games,'' shortstop Derek Jeter said. ''But it's the hottest teams that win in the postseason. You have to have momentum going into the series. You could play a five-game series against a hot team and you're done.''</p>
        <p>On a day when Neagle's agent met with the Yankees to discuss a contract extension and on a night when Neagle could have provided the Yankees some relief, the left-hander faded quickly. After Detroit took a 2-0 lead on Deivi Cruz's homer in the fifth, the Yankees scored two runs in the bottom of the inning. It should have been Neagle's game.</p>
        <p>Instead, Neagle crumbled in the sixth. Neagle failed to field a roller in front of the mound, he threw a wild pitch, he walked the hardly intimidating Billy McMillon to load the bases and help set up a devastating five-run inning. When Neagle was replaced, he was bathed in boos. This was the Tigers, remember. The vastly improved Tigers, but a team Neagle should handle.</p>
        <p>''I would have booed me, too,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Neagle did not look like a $12 million-a-year pitcher, which is what his agent, Barry Meister, asked the Yankees for when the two sides first spoke in July. Neagle will most likely start a possible Game 4 in the postseason, which did not seem like a comforting scenario to the Yankees last night. He blamed himself for making shoddy adjustments and said, ''In here, I don't see anybody panicking or pressing.''</p>
        <p>Maybe Torre is right and the Yankees are relaxed and they will become even more relaxed if they win once. O'Neill spoke strongly about wanting to return to the Yankees next season because they always win. But, before the Yankees can try to win another title, they have to finally clinch the division.</p>
        <p>''I don't have answers for anything right now,'' O'Neill said. ''We want to win games. Right now, everything that can go wrong has gone wrong.''</p>
