        <p>Clinton Orders Oil Released From Emergency Reserve  President Clinton ordered the release of 30 million barrels of oil from the nation's emergency reserve over the next month, only a day after Vice President Al Gore injected the issue into the presidential campaign.

Administration officials said they acted primarily because inventories of heating oil on the East Coast had fallen to worrisomely low levels, raising the risk of shortages should the winter be particularly cold or long.
