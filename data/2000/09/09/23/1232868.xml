        <p>Martin S. Indyk, the American ambassador to Israel and an architect of American policy in the Middle East, has been temporarily relieved of his post and has had his security clearance lifted, pending an investigation into whether he mishandled classified materials, State Department officials said today.</p>
        <p>There was no indication of espionage, the officials said, nor was any American intelligence compromised. But they said the concerns about Mr. Indyk's behavior stretched back at least five years, to the first of his two tours as ambassador to Israel.</p>
        <p>''The department suspended the security clearance of Martin Indyk, United States ambassador to Israel, pending the outcome of an investigation of suspected violations of Department of State security standards,'' said Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman.</p>
        <p>Federal officials involved in the inquiry declined to discuss the specific charges against Mr. Indyk, except to say that questions had been raised about the proper treatment of classified documents. The questions concerned the handling and storage of the documents, and discussion about them, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Indyk is ''cooperating fully'' with investigators from the F.B.I. and the State Department Bureau of Diplomatic Security, officials said. He has returned to the United States, and his deputy chief of mission, Paul Simons, has taken charge of the American Embassy, the officials said.</p>
        <p>In a statement tonight, Mr. Indyk expressed regret that his security clearances has been suspended, leaving him unable to perform his duties, and emphasized his ''firm conviction'' that no classified information had been compromised.</p>
        <p>''For over seven years, in the proud service of my country, I have dedicated myself to the promotion of United States interests in the Middle East,'' Mr. Indyk said, referring especially to negotiations to achieve a comprehensive peace. ''Jeopardizing the national security interests of the United States is absolutely abhorrent to me, and I would never do anything to compromise those interests.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Indyk's departure threatens to complicate the peace process further, as American, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators struggle to reach a deal before President Clinton leaves office. Mr. Indyk, a longtime expert on the region who is close to Prime Minister Ehud Barak, is seen as practically a partner to Dennis Ross, the administration's special Middle East coordinator.</p>
        <p>Another veteran national security official, John M. Deutch, is under investigation by the Justice Department for admitted computer security violations when he was Director of Central Intelligence. Investigators are also trying to determine whether Mr. Deutch committed computer security breaches years earlier as a senior official at the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>The new inquiry highlights a more stringent regime at the State Department on matters of internal security. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright announced a departmentwide shakeup this spring -- including a series of briefings on the handling of classified materials -- after a laptop computer vanished from a secure office and an eavesdropping device, traced to a Russian diplomat, was found in a conference room.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright, who declared herself ''humiliated'' by those lapses, has been under pressure from Congress to turn around her department's lax image. She has ordered State Department security officers to draft a $300 million plan to improve security at the Washington headquarters.</p>
        <p>One American official voiced sympathy for Mr. Indyk's position, calling him the victim of overzealous investigators motivated by Dr. Albright's security concerns.</p>
        <p>A lawmaker who has been critical of the State Department breaches, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, chairman of the International Relations Committee, said that if the allegations were correct, they were ''a matter of highest concern.''</p>
        <p>The incident threatens an unusual career. Mr. Indyk, who was born in London and raised in Australia, did not become an American citizen until 1993, little more than a week before President Clinton appointed him to a job as the top Mideast expert on the National Security Council.</p>
        <p>Before that, his resume included a 10-month stint as deputy director of Australia's intelligence for the Middle East. He also held positions as a professor and the head of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.</p>
        <p>In 1995, President Clinton named Mr. Indyk to his first tour as ambassador to Israel, making him America's first Jewish ambassador to that country.</p>
        <p>As ambassador, Mr. Indyk became a pivotal figure in peace negotiations.</p>
        <p>He became associated with more liberal Israeli leaders, and was an early supporter of Shimon Peres of the Labor Party in his bid to become prime minister. After the election of Benjamin Netanyahu of the Likud Party as prime minister of Israel, Mr. Indyk was transferred to Washington, where he served as assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs.</p>
        <p>After the return to power of a Labor prime minister, Ehud Barak, President Clinton dispatched Mr. Indyk to Tel Aviv in January for a second tour.</p>
        <p>Known for his candor and disdain of bureaucracy, Mr. Indyk angered American Jewish groups this month when he gave a speech calling for Israel to share the control of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 25, 2000, Monday  A headline on Saturday about Martin S. Indyk, the United States ambassador to Israel, whose security clearance was withdrawn over his handling of classified materials, referred incorrectly to his recall to Washington. As the article noted, the recall was temporary, not permanent.</p>
