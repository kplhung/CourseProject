        <p>Ruling in a case that confronted the law with stark life-and-death choices, the Court of Appeal said today that doctors can proceed with an operation to separate joined twins that would sacrifice one in an effort to save the other.</p>
        <p>The unanimous three-judge verdict turned down an appeal by the parents, who said their religious faith compelled them to let nature take its course, with no medical intervention, even though doctors have said both children will probably die if they remained joined.</p>
        <p>Still, lawyers for the parents said they would appeal today's decision to Britain's highest tribunal, the Law Lords of the House of Lords, before surgery scheduled for November.</p>
        <p>Lord Justice Ward, himself the father of twin daughters, said it was ''an agonizing and difficult case'' and expressed the court's sympathy for ''this family blighted with disaster.''</p>
        <p>But he said the court had been convinced by medical testimony that the weaker sister could not sustain life on her own and that if she remained joined, she would hasten the death of her sister, who doctors believe can lead a normal life.</p>
        <p>''The sad fact is that she lives on borrowed time, all of it borrowed from her sister,'' he told the packed chamber of the Royal Courts of Justice. ''She is incapable of independent existence. She is designated for death.''</p>
        <p>During five days of hearings this month ranging over questions of law, ethics, morality and the nature of ''God's will,'' all three jurists observed that they had found the case one of the most testing of their careers. The complexity of the case has prompted widespread interest, dismay and concern as it weighed arguments over whether it is ever lawful to permit the taking of life, and, if so, under what circumstances.</p>
        <p>Advocacy groups that can be outspoken on the charged subjects involved -- euthanasia, the sanctity of life, the rights of newborn children, the primacy of parental authority, the role of the state -- have found this case a difficult one.</p>
        <p>The twins, Jodie and Mary -- false names used by the courts to preserve anonymity -- were born on Aug. 8 at St. Mary's Hospital in Manchester joined at the pelvis. Jodie is said to be bright and alert, but Mary, with an underdeveloped brain, is more passive and relies on Jodie for heart and lung functions and lives only because she is attached to her.</p>
        <p>The parents, Roman Catholics from Gozo, an island in Malta, came to England to have the children when they learned that they were joined and knew they would require sophisticated care that their home community lacked.</p>
        <p>At the first day of appellate hearings on Sept. 4, the parents, who have not been identified and did not attend court, submitted a statement explaining their reason for appealing an Aug. 25 High Court ruling that the operation should go ahead: ''We cannot begin to accept or contemplate that one of our children should die to enable the other one to survive. That is not God's will. Everyone has a right to life, so why should we kill one of our daughters to enable the other one to survive?''</p>
        <p>Their lawyer, Simon Taylor, said that while they understood the ''dire prognosis without separation,'' they could not countenance either of their daughters' being ''actively killed.''</p>
        <p>During the hearings, Lord Justice Ward uttered a haunting comment on the responsibilities the court was obliged to weigh. ''Do we save Jodie by murdering Mary?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>The Manchester medical team said it felt duty-bound to operate after concluding there was an 80 to 90 percent chance that if the twins remained joined, both would die in three to six months as Jodie's heart failed under the burden of supporting Mary.</p>
        <p>During the hearings, specialists in treating joined twins from Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London raised what Mr. Taylor called ''the horrible specter'' that they could survive longer, possibly even for years, with weakening Mary slowly draining away her healthier sister Jodie's life until both died.</p>
        <p>Judith Parker , representing the interests of Jodie, argued that there was no purpose served in trying to keep her ''unviable'' sister alive.  ''We say there are no interests in preserving what is unfortunately a futile life,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The statement produced an objection from the Most Rev. Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, Archbishop of Westminster and leader of Catholics in England and Wales. In a written submission to the court, he said that ''innocent'' Mary must be allowed to live out her tragic existence. In the church's eyes, he said, she enjoyed the same ''basic worth and dignity'' of every human being, adding, ''She has done nothing which could justify killing her.'' Separation, he told the court, would be ''morally impermissible.''</p>
        <p>This, in turn, raised the issue of whether Mary, given her total dependency on Jodie, could be regarded as ''a person in being'' who had been ''born alive'' and was thus entitled to the law's protection in living out her natural span, no matter how short.  One lawyer compared Mary to someone being artificially kept alive by a life support machine which doctors would have no hesitation to remove from a patient in such hopeless condition. In this case, he said, the life support machine was Jodie.</p>
