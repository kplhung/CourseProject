        <p>A day after Vice President Al Gore called for tapping federal oil reserves, Gov. George W. Bush sought to turn the proposal into a test of character. He accused his opponent of turning ''political somersaults'' and proclaimed that voters ''don't want flip-floppers as president of the United States.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush sharply criticized Mr. Gore today as he campaigned across Florida, a state that Republicans once thought would be safely theirs, in part because Mr. Bush's brother Jeb is governor. It was Mr. Bush's second trip here in two weeks and his sixth since the primaries ended in March.</p>
        <p>The Texas governor also pledged before a supportive crowd of elderly residents in Sun City, Fla., that he would promote medical advances ''with new resources and new resolve'' by doubling financing for the National Institutes of Health and more than doubling the budget of the National Cancer Institute over five years.</p>
        <p>The cumulative new spending across 10 years would be $67 billion. Congressional Republicans have already embarked on the same goal, and President Clinton has been signing the annual increases into law.</p>
        <p>From the moment Mr. Bush's campaign plane landed in Sarasota on Florida's west coast, he was on the offensive, trying to stoke perceptions that Mr. Gore is wavering and too political. He pointed to Mr. Gore's call for the administration to release oil from government stockpiles to stabilize prices -- which Mr. Clinton agreed to do later in the day -- was a reversal of Mr. Gore's stand from last winter when prices were significantly lower than they are now.</p>
        <p>''It should be interesting to America to hear the facts,'' Mr. Bush shouted at an airport rally in Sarasota. ''Last winter my opponent opposed the plan to use the strategic petroleum reserve. He was right then. But now we're getting close to the time when we find out, who's steady, who's got a vision, who doesn't listen to polls and focus groups, how he has flip-flopped on the issue.</p>
        <p>''The reason why Florida is going to vote for this team is because they don't want flip-floppers as the president of the United States,'' Mr. Bush said. At another point, he said, ''Florida wants to turn back from the past of double talking, of changing positions, of just kind of talking one way and doing another.''</p>
        <p>This was supposed to be a week in which Mr. Bush put a new focus on the issues in a ''cradle to grave'' tour intended to show that he has proposals that would help middle-class voters at every stage of their lives. And each day he has drawn contrasts between his plan and Mr. Gore's.</p>
        <p>But his campaign also never  stopped trying to raise questions about Mr. Gore's character and credibility.</p>
        <p>Pouncing on every possible misstep, Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, told reporters that in one week, the vice president had muted his criticism of Hollywood, run into a controversy over whether he had embellished a story about the amount his mother-in-law pays for prescription drugs, ''remembered a childhood lullaby'' that had not been written until he was older and called for tapping the oil reserves ''after saying eight months ago it was a bad idea.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bush tried to use the spike in oil prices to bolster a broader theme, his charge that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore ''have not led'' the country. Consumers, he said, wonder ''where the administration has been for the last seven years; where was the plan?''</p>
        <p>Polls showed Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore running neck and neck in Florida, which narrowly voted for Mr. Bush's father in 1992, but went for Mr. Clinton in 1996. Both parties have spent millions of dollars in the state.</p>
        <p>''It's wistful thinking on behalf of our opponents -- they said they think they can carry Florida,'' Mr. Bush said at the airport. ''They don't know what's about to hit them in Florida.''</p>
        <p>While he talked extensively about his Social Security and Medicare proposals at his next stop in Sun City, he also tried to woo older voters with his proposals on medical research.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said that to spur medical research and make ''an investment in the health and hope of Americans and people across the world,'' he would spend an additional $67 billion over 10 years to complete the goal of doubling the budget of the National Institutes of Health. Congressional Republicans are already working toward that goal through annual spending bills, and Mr. Gore has also called for doubling the spending on the federal institutes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush compared his goal to John F. Kennedy's challenge to put a man on the moon. ''I will fund and lead a medical moonshot to reach far beyond what seems possible today and discover new cures for age-old afflictions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He reminded crowds that President Richard M. Nixon had declared a war on cancer, and he pledged to renew that cause. He pointed to higher cancer survival rates and the progress that had been made in curing diseases like leukemia ''that tragically touched my own family.'' His sister Robin died of leukemia as a child.</p>
        <p>The governor was repeatedly given standing ovations at the Kingspoint Theater in the Sun City Center. When he raised Mr. Gore's proposal that the United States should tap the oil reserve, people started yelling 'no'' in opposition.</p>
        <p>''That's my position,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He did political somersaults.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush made his signature pledge to restore ''honor and integrity'' to the White House, he won whoops, applause and a standing ovation. His first questioner appeared to catch the crowd's mood when she asked, ''Are you going to be able to have a big enough shovel to clean up Washington?''</p>
