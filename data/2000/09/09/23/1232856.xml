        <p>After more than seven years opposing President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia on the battlefield and in the negotiating room, the Clinton administration is making one last stand against him -- among the voters.</p>
        <p>In a high-profile strategy that began a year ago, the administration has helped finance an opposition movement that is backing Vojislav Kostunica in his campaign to unseat Mr. Milosevic from the Yugoslav presidency in voting on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Even if, as almost everyone expects, Mr. Milosevic simply declares himself the victor, Washington is hoping that angry voters will take to the streets in a way that eventually drives him from office, much as Ferdinand E. Marcos was ousted in the Philippines in 1986.</p>
        <p>The strategy largely reflects the thinking of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who has made democracy a centerpiece of her tenure and has cast Mr. Milosevic as her most bitter enemy.</p>
        <p>But the plan, which has ranged from bringing fractious opposition leaders here to meet Dr. Albright in her seventh-floor suite at the State Department to pumping million of dollars into voter education groups and the independent media, has its risks.</p>
        <p>For one thing, Mr. Kostunica is a Serbian nationalist who does not necessarily support the NATO presence in Kosovo. Without an official American presence in Serbia, it is difficult to gauge how much of the $25 million spent on the opposition over the last year has been fruitfully used. In fact, the blatant American campaign against Mr. Milosevic has given him a powerful theme for his campaign.</p>
        <p>The administration officials who devised the strategy said they believed that Mr. Milosevic, regardless of the vote tallies, would manipulate the results and declare victory. In the best case, the officials said, they hoped that opposition protests would eventually lead Mr. Milosevic's all-important army and security forces to turn against him.</p>
        <p>''The people of Yugoslavia are standing up,'' said James C. O'Brien, special adviser to President Clinton and Dr. Albright on democracy in the Balkans. ''They believe it's time for change. There is the potential for seismic change in Yugoslavia.''</p>
        <p>The administration, Mr. O'Brien suggested, hopes that the elections will provide a ''crucial moment, like the Berlin Wall falling.'' But he said Washington would settle for a ''tide turning.''</p>
        <p>The national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, noted recently that ''people power'' spelled the end in Manila in 1986 and that the same movement could occur now in Belgrade.</p>
        <p>Other officials acknowledged, however, that it was unclear how motivated the opposition would be to protest, whether it could rouse a weary population to rally in great numbers and whether the security forces would turn against Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>To encourage opposition activities in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, the United States has spent $25 million in the last year, according to Donald L. Pressley, the assistant administrator at the United States Agency for International Development. Nearly half of the money, $11 million, was spent on helping unions, media organizations and civic associations, Mr. Pressley said.</p>
        <p>Two groups here, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, were allocated $4 million to help groups in Serbia campaign door to door and to develop other get-out-the-vote techniques, Mr. Pressley said. Much of the remaining money went to Serbian cities like Nis and Novi Sad, which are run by independent mayors.</p>
        <p>Because American officials are barred from Serbia, a satellite embassy, under the direction of Ambassador William Montgomery, was established in Budapest in the summer to be the fulcrum for the effort to build democracy in Serbia. From Budapest, conferences have been organized in southern Hungary to bring Serbians together with turnout experts from Central Europe.</p>
        <p>The Agency for International Development has given contracts to establish nongovernmental organizations like Freedom House and the German Marshall Fund, which give grants to Central European groups that have access to Serbia, Mr. Pressley said.</p>
        <p>Thus, O.K. 98, a group that helped unseat Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia in 1998, is working alongside Serbian groups in door-to-door canvassing, he said.</p>
        <p>In Serbia, there have been complaints that some of the foreign activity enriches individuals with cash, cell phones and faxes. Mr. Pressley said that $1.5 million of the $25 million effort was earmarked for audits and that A.I.D.'s Budapest operation for Serbia included an auditor.</p>
        <p>Administration officials, following their usual policy, refused to confirm or deny the existence of covert operations in Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>One main reason for optimism in the administration is that officials apparently believe that their carefully devised effort to build democracy has helped magnify interest in the opposition candidate, Mr. Kostunica.</p>
        <p>Rarely in more than seven years of dealing with Mr. Milosevic has the Clinton administration sounded so upbeat. Nor have officials been so willing to advertise their policy. One official said this week that he had to warn about too much euphoria inside the State Department.</p>
        <p>The administration has had little to do with Mr. Kostunica, a law professor who has maintained a fierce independence from American policy and who has said that if he came to power he would not send Mr. Milosevic to the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The tribunal indicted Mr. Milosevic last year for what it said were crimes committed by his security forces in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright has watched enthusiastically as more than a dozen parties in Serbia's famously fractured opposition decided to back Mr. Kostunica. Administration officials are also upbeat because, they say, they believe that Mr. Milosevic miscalculated by suddenly calling the elections in July, making this his first direct electoral test since 1992.</p>
        <p>The unanswered question in the strategy is what happens after the vote. In his 13 years in power, Mr. Milosevic has repeatedly shown his ability to maneuver, manipulating allies and rivals to maintain his grip.</p>
        <p>Some administration officials said they believed that if Mr. Milosevic did not lose by a wide margin and, therefore, did not resort to extensive fraud, there would be a less compelling case for protest.</p>
        <p>Other officials argue that ordinary people, buffeted by a bad economy and accepting of official propaganda that the opposition is backed by foreign interests, lack the passion for an enduring show of protest.</p>
        <p>Other questions concern whether the police and soldiers are prepared to use large-scale force against fellow Serbs. If they are, that raises a question about how much the administration should encourage protest.</p>
        <p>''Is this going to be like 1956?'' asked one senior administration official, recalling the Western hints to the Hungarians that help would be on the way if the Soviet Union quashed the uprising.</p>
        <p>In the last several days, Bratislav Grubacic, a Serbian journalist who is widely read in the Western diplomatic community, has warned that Mr. Milosevic will attempt to stay in power at any cost. ''The bigger danger for the Serbs,'' Mr. Grubacic wrote, ''is that the authorities could apply repressive measures such as those in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.''</p>
