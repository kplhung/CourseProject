        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A Sept. 18 editorial supports a bill that would require states to lower their drunken driving standards to a .08 blood alcohol concentration or see federal highway money cut. It's no surprise that it did not include newly released evidence on the .08 states.</p>
        <p>Illinois and Virginia, for example,  recorded increases in drunken driving deaths in 1999. Compare that to Maryland, which has rejected .08 for many years and had a 12 percent decrease in drunken-driving fatalities for the same period.</p>

        <p>You say studies suggest that a nationwide .08 standard would save about 500 lives a year. In assessing the two studies ''proving'' that, the General Accounting Office called one ''unfounded'' and said that if the other had not excluded drivers under 21, there would be no statistically significant reductions associated with .08 laws.</p>
