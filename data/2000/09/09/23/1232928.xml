        <p>Don't shoot the old man. On the other hand, don't necessarily believe a word he says.</p>
        <p>After winning his fourth Olympic rowing gold medal in Atlanta in 1996, Steven Redgrave was heard to say -- by a multitude of witnesses -- ''If anybody sees me near a boat again they should shoot me.''</p>
        <p>Today Redgrave was back where he was in 1984 and 1988 and 1992 and 1996, accepting a gold medal -- his fifth, this time in the coxless fours for Britain, along with his longtime teammate and the stroke, Matthew Pinsent, as well as Tim Foster and James Cracknell.</p>
        <p>The Britons won in 5 minutes 56.24 seconds, which was 38 hundredths of a second ahead of Italy and a full 1.37 seconds ahead of Australia in third.</p>
        <p>Redgrave, now 38, becomes only the second athlete in Olympic history to win gold medals in five consecutive Games. The Hungarian fencer Aladar Gerevich won six golds between 1932 and 1960 (no games were held in 1940 or 1944) while a Danish sailor, Paul Elvstrom, won four from 1948 to 1960; the American discus thrower Al Oerter won four from 1956 to 1968, and Carl Lewis won four in the long jump from 1984 to 1996.</p>
        <p>''Most athletes dream of one gold medal and he's got five -- amazing,'' said Bo Hanson of the Australian crew.</p>
        <p>Redgrave, who has overcome the onset of adult diabetes, an appendectomy and the worsening of chronic colitis since his fourth gold medal, said he could not choose one gold medal race over another.</p>
        <p>But today's festivities were surely more jubilant than the ones in 1996, which took place a few hours after the bomb went off in Centennial Park, killing one person and throwing a huge pall over the Games. Still, many people heard Redgrave's promise to retire.</p>
        <p>It was a promise that Redgrave broke. Rowing is all he knows. There is no medical office or law office or family boardroom awaiting him. He is the son of a plasterer who has yet to identify what he wants to do when he stops pulling his way through the water.</p>
        <p>His wife, Ann, a doctor with the British team, didn't believe his promise to retire.</p>
        <p>''He has lived with the job so long now he doesn't know any other way,'' she said then. ''My training as a doctor tells me people just can't switch off like that.''</p>
        <p>After talking it over with his family, Redgrave decided to keep going. He has outlasted a number of partners, winning in the four-oared boat with Martin Cross, Richard Budgett and Andy Holmes at the 1984 Games outside Los Angeles, winning the pairs with Holmes in 1988 in Seoul, South Korea, working for a year with Simon Berrisford, who was injured, and then teaming with Pinsent in 1992 outside Barcelona, Spain, and in 1996.</p>
        <p>For almost four years he has been part of this unit. The English burst out in front today and dared anybody to catch them. Redgrave said he was impressed -- perhaps even annoyed -- that the Italians kept coming at them, ''but I always felt we were going to win.''</p>
        <p>After the Britons crossed the bubbling water that marks the finish, Pinsent scrambled backward to hug Redgrave and fell into the water.</p>
        <p>''Steve told us, 'Remember these six minutes the rest of your life,' '' reported Foster, a relatively new teammate.</p>
        <p>Redgrave was hugged by members of the Italian crew, and within earshot of a dock full of reporters he told one of the rowers, ''You're a pretty good rower yourself,'' only a bit more earthily.</p>
        <p>Then he was off to the medal ceremonies, where his gold was presented by Princess Anne of Britain, a delegate of the International Olympic Committee. Then Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the I.O.C., pinned a special gold medal on Redgrave, commemorating his fifth straight gold medal.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Redgrave praised his teammates and his coach, Jurgen Grobler, and particularly Pinsent, his partner in three gold medals.</p>
        <p>''I thought of things I was going to say to Matthew, but I was pretty knackered,'' Redgrave said. ''These words may come out sometime, but they don't have to be. We know how we feel about each other.''</p>
        <p>Redgrave thanked his wife, who was seated at the press conference, for her support during ''all the dark times'' and then he smiled and said: ''She's made it clear. It's the marriage or the boat. I'll have to give it a thought.''</p>
        <p>Pinsent refused to say whether he would pursue another gold medal, and so did Redgrave. The other day Redgrave said: ''I will definitely stop. I can't see myself rowing at any level after these Olympics. But I said that before, so nobody's going to believe me.''</p>
        <p>Today he said: ''You won't get any quotes from me this time. I have to live with it.''</p>
