        <p>''Krapp's Last Tape,'' Atom Egoyan's loving and scrupulous adaptation of Samuel Beckett's 1958 play, opens with a bit of melancholy slapstick that offers an elegant reminder of the playwright's affinities with the great clowns of silent cinema, Buster Keaton in particular. Krapp, a mournful old man who lives surrounded by the detritus of his once-heroic intellectual ambitions -- books, papers and boxes of reel-to-reel tape -- reaches into a drawer of his metal desk and extracts a banana. He removes the peel in four sections, which he lets fall to the floor, and then, with languorous relish, eats the banana, whereupon he circumnavigates the desk and promply slips, disappearing from the frame with a poignant and hilarious crash.</p>
        <p>Krapp is played with Keatonesque weariness by John Hurt, whose grizzled face and ravaged voice make him an ideal vessel for Beckett's meditation on the displacement of experience by memory. Krapp spends his days listening to tapes he made earlier in his life, and recording new ones. The technology he uses may be obsolescent, but the play is remarkably prescient in its understanding of how, in the modern world, identity is refracted by ever-proliferating forms of mechanical reproduction. For most of the play, Krapp's voice -- the still-young, smooth voice of his 39-year-old self -- is detached from his body, the bent, sad frame that leans over the tape recorder as if in a desperate attempt to touch the vanished past. What the older Krapp hears is his younger self recounting, without quite knowing it, the eclipse of his hopes. He impatiently fast-forwards through the parts of the tape that record a great philosophical insight and obsessively returns to the memory of a moment of intimacy in a rowboat.</p>

        <p>''Krapp's Last Tape,'' Atom Egoyan's loving and scrupulous adaptation of Samuel Beckett's 1958 play, opens with a bit of melancholy slapstick that offers an elegant reminder of the playwright's affinities with the great clowns of silent cinema, Buster Keaton in particular. Krapp, a mournful old man who lives surrounded by the detritus of his once-heroic intellectual ambitions -- books, papers and boxes of reel-to-reel tape -- reaches into a drawer of his metal desk and extracts a banana. He removes the peel in four sections, which he lets fall to the floor, and then, with languorous relish, eats the banana, whereupon he circumnavigates the desk and promply slips, disappearing from the frame with a poignant and hilarious crash.</p>
        <p>Krapp is played with Keatonesque weariness by John Hurt, whose grizzled face and ravaged voice make him an ideal vessel for Beckett's meditation on the displacement of experience by memory. Krapp spends his days listening to tapes he made earlier in his life, and recording new ones. The technology he uses may be obsolescent, but the play is remarkably prescient in its understanding of how, in the modern world, identity is refracted by ever-proliferating forms of mechanical reproduction. For most of the play, Krapp's voice -- the still-young, smooth voice of his 39-year-old self -- is detached from his body, the bent, sad frame that leans over the tape recorder as if in a desperate attempt to touch the vanished past. What the older Krapp hears is his younger self recounting, without quite knowing it, the eclipse of his hopes. He impatiently fast-forwards through the parts of the tape that record a great philosophical insight and obsessively returns to the memory of a moment of intimacy in a rowboat.</p>
        <p>The play is a study in grief and frustration -- constipation, really, both spiritual and physical, thanks to those bananas -- and, like most of Beckett's works, extremely funny in its rigorous fatalism. Krapp's grand insight yielded a book that sold 17 copies, 11 of them purchased by ''libraries beyond the sea.'' ''Getting known,'' Krapp howls. Mr. Hurt's baggy eyes seem to contain a lifetime's worth of unshed tears, and when, at the end, one is allowed to escape down his cheek, Mr. Egoyan's film strikes its only false note. Beckett's mix of stoic wit and existential anguish is a cocktail best served dry.</p>
        <p>Speaking of bodily fluids, ''Krapp's Last Tape'' is being shown tomorrow and Monday at the New York Film Festival along with Neil Jordan's adaptation of ''Not I.'' Both films are part of a continuing project, based in Dublin, in which leading filmmakers are invited to bring suitable works to the screen with the stipulation that they respect the integrity of the text and obey, as far as possible, Beckett's famously fastidious instructions about staging.</p>
        <p>''Not I'' stars Julianne Moore -- or rather, Julianne Moore's mouth, which has been filmed in extreme close-up spewing out (with amazing precision) another monologue of splintered identity. The attentive viewer -- or even an inattentive one -- will marvel at the rosy health of Ms. Moore's gums, and note the little bubble of saliva that appears for a moment on the side of her tongue. Mr. Jordan's camera considers her mouth from the front and the side, in medium and extreme close-up, cutting from one shot to another with choreographic rigor.</p>
        <p>The magic, or course, is in the words, which pack a lifetime of loss, confusion and curious liberation into 13 exhilarating minutes.</p>
        <p>KRAPP'S LAST TAPE</p>
        <p>Directed and edited by Atom Egoyan; written by Samuel Beckett; director of photography, Peter Mettler; production designer, Clodagh Conroy; produced by Michael Colgan and Alan Moloney. Running time: 55 minutes. This film is not rated. Shown with ''Not I'' tomorrow at 7:15 and Monday at 9 P.M. at Alice Tully Hall as part of the 38th New York Film Festival.</p>
        <p>WITH: John Hurt (Krapp).</p>
