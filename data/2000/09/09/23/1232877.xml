        <p>A federal judge has increased the sentences of two former executives of the Archer Daniels Midland Company for their roles in a global conspiracy to fix the price of the animal-feed additive lysine.</p>
        <p>Judge Blanche Manning of United States District Court added one year to the two-year prison term of Michael Andreas, a former Archer Daniels vice chairman, and added nine months to the two-year prison term of Terrance Wilson, a former company division head, said Randall Samborn, a spokesman for the United States attorney's office in Chicago.</p>

        <p>A federal judge has increased the sentences of two former executives of the Archer Daniels Midland Company for their roles in a global conspiracy to fix the price of the animal-feed additive lysine.</p>
        <p>Judge Blanche Manning of United States District Court added one year to the two-year prison term of Michael Andreas, a former Archer Daniels vice chairman, and added nine months to the two-year prison term of Terrance Wilson, a former company division head, said Randall Samborn, a spokesman for the United States attorney's office in Chicago.</p>
        <p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit said in June that the original sentences were not long enough.</p>
        <p>In July 1999, Mr. Andreas and Mr. Wilson received their prison sentences and each was fined $350,000. They began serving their sentences in October 1999 after they were convicted in September 1998.</p>
        <p>The convictions ended a three-year Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry focused on the company and its foreign rivals in the $600 million world market for lysine.</p>
        <p>Archer Daniels, one of the world's largest grain and oilseed processors, pleaded guilty in October 1996 to fixing the price of lysine and citric acid, which is used in soft drinks and other products.</p>
        <p>It paid a $100 million fine, which was then a record.</p>
