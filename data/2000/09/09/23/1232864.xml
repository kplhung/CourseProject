        <p>With Yugoslavs preparing to vote on Sunday, final opinion polls show that President Slobodan Milosevic continues to trail his main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, but by a margin that the opposition worries may be overcome by fraud.</p>
        <p>Poll results vary widely here, partly because of the uncertainty about how votes in Montenegro and Kosovo will be cast and counted. The Montenegrin government has said it is staying out of the election. But supporters of Mr. Milosevic there will probably vote anyway.</p>
        <p>In Kosovo, the Serbian community probably numbers barely 100,000 people, and the Albanian majority will continue their decade-old boycott of any Yugoslav election. But Mr. Milosevic may try, as he has in previous elections, to fake the results by claiming hundreds of thousands of votes from Kosovo.</p>
        <p>The opposition insists that Mr. Milosevic will attempt widespread vote manipulation. He and his government say that the elections will be free and fair and that the opposition is preparing vote fraud.</p>
        <p>The conflicting assertions may allow Mr. Milosevic, if he chooses, to invalidate the election on Sunday and call a rerun at a later date, when interest and passions may have cooled.</p>
        <p>One of the most reliable polls of Serbia without Kosovo, completed a week ago, shows Mr. Kostunica with 32.5 percent of the vote compared to Mr. Milosevic's 26.6, with 20.2 percent undecided and 8 percent saying they will not vote at all. Among those who say they are sure to vote, Mr. Kostunica receives 45.3 percent to Mr. Milosevic's 37.1, with the candidate of the Serbian Radical Party, led by Vojislav Seselj, receiving 10.1 percent and the candidate of the Serbian Renewal Movement, a party led by Vuk Draskovic, 7.5.</p>
        <p>Srdjan Bogosavljevic, director of the Strategic Marketing and Media Research Institute, which conducted the poll, said that ''in a free and fair counting,'' no one candidate would be able to win more than 50 percent of the votes.</p>
        <p>To win in the first round, Mr. Bogosavljevic said, Mr. Milosevic would have to find, steal or manufacture an additional 700,000 votes or manage to disqualify large numbers of votes for his opponents, an almost impossible task without widespread and obvious faking in Kosovo. A high turnout would also make vote fraud much harder to accomplish.</p>
        <p>Even opposition leaders expect that Mr. Milosevic will declare victory in the first round, avoiding a runoff, a fatalism explicit in Mr. Bogosavljevic's poll. When asked who will win the elections, nearly 41 percent of Serbs said Mr. Milosevic, compared to 30 percent for Mr. Kostunica, with 25 percent unsure or unwilling to say.</p>
        <p>People will also be voting for the upper and lower houses of the federal Parliament and for local governments. In 1996, the opposition won most of Serbia's largest cities. But a split between the Serbian Renewal Movement and the rest of the opposition may lead to the loss of some cities this time, including Kragujevac and even Belgrade.</p>
        <p>The Center for Free Elections and Democracy, a nongovernmental organization that is trying to monitor the fairness of the poll, says it already has evidence of fraud in the presidential race. The director of the center, Slobodanka Nedovic, was given a genuine ballot already filled out for Mr. Milosevic. Some state workers have reported that they expect to be handed such filled-out ballots, with instructions to return the blank ones that they receive at the polling stations to their supervisors on Monday morning.</p>
        <p>The opposition here has published newspaper advertisements that urge such workers, if they fear for their jobs, to pretend to go along but to invalidate their ballots by circling the names of all five presidential candidates rather than casting an unwanted vote.</p>
        <p>Most opposition leaders and experts said they thought that stealing more than 10 or 15 percent of the vote in Serbia would be extremely difficult, because polling stations will be monitored by party officials, including members of the Serbian Radical Party. Its leader, Mr. Seselj, although in a coalition with Mr. Milosevic, has accused him of using unfair media practices and preparing to steal the election.</p>
        <p>It will be difficult for Mr. Milosevic to claim more than 150,000 votes from Montenegro, which has 440,000 voters, at the most.</p>
        <p>The two main potential areas for fraud, the experts said, are Kosovo and the security services. For the first time in Yugoslavia, the police as well as the military will be allowed to vote at their barracks, where there will be no monitoring.</p>
        <p>The main source for possibly fraudulent votes will be Kosovo and those who live or used to live there. Because it is run by the United Nations and patrolled by NATO-led troops, Serbian officials have extended two Serbian constituencies, Vranje and Prokuplje, to cover the territory and population of Kosovo, including more than one million ethnic Albanian voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic and the Federal Election Commission that he controls have announced several hundred polling stations throughout Kosovo. State-controlled media have been quoting a few Kosovar Albanians as saying they will vote for Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>The most obvious case of electoral fraud was in the 1997 Serbian presidential elections, when 200,000 Kosovo Albanians were listed as voting for Mr. Milosevic's candidate, Milan Milutinovic, providing a margin of victory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seselj, a strident nationalist who has fallen in and out of favor with Mr. Milosevic during the last decade, was widely considered the real victor. But the round in which he triumphed was declared invalid because of fraud, buying Mr. Milosevic time in which to conjure up a victory. In the end, there were four rounds of voting, and that may be a model for Mr. Milosevic this time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic may have left himself another option, with the declaration by his federal prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, that Mr. Milosevic's mandate as president runs through its original term of July 2001, no matter what happens in these elections.</p>
        <p>The constitution, amended in a day in July to allow for direct presidential elections, is unclear on the point. But applicable laws would indicate that his mandate should end within 10 days if he loses the election.</p>
