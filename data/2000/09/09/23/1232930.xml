        <p>It was the kind of hit Mike Piazza has made famous, the laser over the right-field wall. It is a product of his superior strength and a simple swing. He stands still and upright in the batter's box, then with a jolt, the ball is gone. Nobody, perhaps, can hit a ball that hard the opposite way.</p>
        <p>Piazza is confident again after his best game at the plate this month, a two-homer night in which he pulled his first shot and went to right field with his second in a 9-6 Mets victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. The pitcher who gave up the second homer, Chris Brock, suggested the ball might be juiced.</p>
        <p>''The ball's juiced? Really? Well, maybe they should check these right here,'' Piazza said, pointing to his forearms and laughing. ''Tell him I have all the respect in the world, but he's not the first pitcher I've hit one off out there.''</p>
        <p>Brock will probably not be the last, either. Piazza entered the game batting .189 this month, but he has slowly been emerging from his slump. He has hit a homer in each ballpark on this three-city road trip, and now has 38 for the season. His first homer broke a 3-3 tie in the sixth inning, and his second gave the Mets a cushion after a rocky eighth inning by John Franco.</p>
        <p>Franco, the Mets' setup man, came in for Bobby J. Jones (10-6) after seven innings, protecting a 7-3 lead. But Scott Rolen hit a two-run homer and Pat Burrell had a bases-empty shot, narrowing the lead to one run. After Piazza's two-run homer, Armando Benitez came in and pitched a scoreless ninth, collecting his 39th save and breaking Franco's club record, set in 1998.</p>
        <p>''I don't know about the record,'' Benitez said after the game. ''They told me now. I don't pay attention. I just try to do my job.''</p>
        <p>He did it with a 1-2-3 inning, striking out Doug Glanville for the last out and looking ''rather possessed'' to Manager Bobby Valentine. If Benitez and Piazza continue to perform well, the Mets will have a much better chance in the postseason -- in which they almost certainly will participate.</p>
        <p>The victory increased the Mets' lead in the National League wild-card race to five and a half games over the Los Angeles Dodgers, who played host to San Diego tonight. The Mets gained a game on Atlanta, which lost tonight, 6-4. The Mets now trail the Braves by three and a half games.</p>
        <p>General Manager Steve Phillips wondered aloud before the game about the propriety of celebrating the clinching of a wild-card berth. Afterward, he had an answer: if the Mets are still alive in the N.L. East race when they secure it, they will not celebrate.</p>
        <p>''Our goal is to win the division, not to just be the wild-card winner,'' Phillips said.</p>
        <p>Still, Valentine continues to give Piazza rest, as he did on Thursday; the theory is that as a catcher, Piazza is worn down this month. Piazza does not agree.</p>
        <p>''I'm fine,'' he said. ''This is the time when you can't feel sorry for yourself. You can't say, 'I'm tired' and make excuses. We play 162 ballgames and you've got to take it to the last game of the season, and hopefully beyond. That's the attitude you have to have. I'm sure a lot of guys are tired, but teams that do anything in the playoffs don't hang their hat on being tired.''</p>
        <p>By going 3 for 5, Piazza improved his average this month to .224. His September slide has received considerable attention and may cost him the most valuable player award. But Piazza, who has come close but never received the honor, said he was only concerned with his effort.</p>
        <p>He can control effort, he said, not production. With his team still in the playoff hunt, Piazza seemed to say, losing ground in the M.V.P. chase matters little. ''I'm a big boy -- I'll roll with it,'' he said, although he acknowledged that he had felt sorry for himself lately and had experienced a range of emotions during his struggles at the plate.</p>
        <p>Piazza's slump has lasted three weeks, but Jones knows of worse struggles. He missed a month to injury early in the year and has labored the rest of the time, accepting a demotion to Class AAA Norfolk in mid-June. He is 9-3 since his return, and his 10 victories this year are the most he has had since he won 15 in 1997, when he made the All-Star team.</p>
        <p>''After the way I started,'' he said, ''to pitch the way I have the second half is something I have to be proud of.''</p>
        <p>Jones had a 3-1 lead through four innings, but the Phillies tied it -- aided by a questionable call on a ball Derek Bell appeared to catch in the fourth, and by a Jimmy Rollins single that deflected off Jones's glove in the fifth.</p>
        <p>Piazza regained the lead for the Mets when he jumped on Randy Wolf's first pitch in the sixth, sending it on a line over the left field fence. The Mets won for just the eighth time in 21 games this month, but that homer and the one that followed served notice that their franchise player just may be back.</p>
        <p>''We're not a one-man wrecking crew,'' Valentine said, ''but the wreck is a lot bigger when he's contributing.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Mets left fielder BENNY AGBAYANI left the game in the fifth inning after straining his right hamstring stepping on home plate. Manager BOBBY VALENTINE said Agbayani would probably need a couple of days off before returning to the lineup. . . . The Phillies' rookie left fielder PAT BURRELL is now a certified Met killer. He is batting .300 against the Mets this year, with four homers and 11 runs batted in. . . . Now that BOBBY J. JONES is 10-6, the Mets have five starters with double digits in victories. The last time that happened was in 1988, with DAVID CONE, RON DARLING, SID FERNANDEZ, DWIGHT GOODEN and BOB OJEDA.</p>
