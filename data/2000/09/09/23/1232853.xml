        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel has not denied the importance of Sunday's game with the Redskins, calling it his team's biggest game of the first half of the season. It may also be the most anticipated game the Giants have played since Fassel's first year as coach in 1997.</p>
        <p>That season, the Giants finished strong and met Minnesota in the playoffs, losing, 23-22, after holding a 9-point lead with 90 seconds to play. Two mediocre seasons followed and the Giants never had a record worthy of making a game huge, as Fassel calls this one.</p>

        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel has not denied the importance of Sunday's game with the Redskins, calling it his team's biggest game of the first half of the season. It may also be the most anticipated game the Giants have played since Fassel's first year as coach in 1997.</p>
        <p>That season, the Giants finished strong and met Minnesota in the playoffs, losing, 23-22, after holding a 9-point lead with 90 seconds to play. Two mediocre seasons followed and the Giants never had a record worthy of making a game huge, as Fassel calls this one.</p>
        <p>''You have to win to have a meaningful game,'' Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn said today after practice.</p>
        <p>Fassel anticipated an emotional week and, while he did not want to dwell on the obvious with the players, he has reminded them of the game's significance.</p>
        <p>''You're walking that fine line because it is a huge game and it's a big game for us, a really big game,'' Fassel said. ''But is this going to finalize and make our season if we win it? No. Is it going to make us down and out if we lose it? No. But there is a lot of significance for us in whether we win and how that will play out the rest of the year.''</p>
        <p>For the Giants (3-0), playing the Redskins on Sunday night provides an opportunity to prove that their first three victories -- over Arizona, Philadelphia and Chicago -- were something more than victories over struggling teams. The Giants have yet to trail in a game, and quarterback Kerry Collins admitted that the offense has not yet needed to pull out a victory in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>A victory would also vault the Giants into a commanding lead in the National Football Conference East, although Sehorn said: ''It's a step for us. There's no control in Week 4, let's get that clear.''</p>
        <p>The team that really needs a victory is the Redskins (1-2), if they want to keep their Super Bowl hopes from fading. For the second straight week the Giants will face a desperate team, although this time it will be a more talented one; last Sunday Chicago was trying to avoid an 0-3 start and could not.</p>
        <p>An off-season spending spree also brought huge expectations for Washington, which appeared in disarray in losing its last two games, first to Detroit and then to Dallas on Monday night.</p>
        <p>The Redskins held a players only meeting on Wednesday and acknowledged that their season could hang on Sunday's game.</p>
        <p>That was a far cry from the mood at the Giants' practice outside Giants Stadium today. Players were enjoying themselves in practice, with receiver Ike Hilliard yelling to celebrate a nice catch as the team practiced its two-minute offense. Fassel has worked hard this week to prepare for Sunday, while trying not to place too much pressure on his players.</p>
        <p>''I don't want everyone walking around here hyped up on Wednesday and Thursday, and by Sunday night feel like we're exhausted and spent,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>There are other contrasts. Unlike Washington, the Giants are relatively injury free. Tight end Pete Mitchell returned to the field today, but he was still limited by an ulcer in his intestines that forced him to miss practice on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
        <p>Fassel said Mitchell would probably play Sunday, but he has had only three practices since injuring his knee in the first preseason game on Aug. 5. He had two catches in his return against Chicago last week.</p>
        <p>Washington, though, is fighting more than injuries. Defensive tackle Dana Stubblefield was arrested this week on charges of assaulting his wife in a dispute about luggage. He will play on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The Redskins will be without receiver Michael Westbrook (knee) and center Cory Raymer (knee). Fullback Larry Centers (elbow) was upgraded today to questionable.</p>
        <p>Even cornerback Deion Sanders has not been above reproach. Two weeks ago, Detroit completed 8 of 10 passes to Sanders's side of the field.</p>
        <p>There will be some interesting matchups on Sunday. Defensive end Michael Strahan will face Redskins tackle Jon Jansen, a second-year player who helped Washington dominate the Giants, 50-21, in their first meeting last season. Jansen and his fellow linemen each received game balls for that game after holding Strahan and the Giants sackless.</p>
        <p>The Giants will try to stop running back Stephen Davis, who rushed for 309 yards in two games against them last season. And for all the problems the embattled quarterback Brad Johnson has had leading the offense, Washington's defense has held opponents to fewer first downs (42) than has the Giants defense (45).</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>RON DIXON, the rookie receiver and kick returner, was held out of practice with hamstring tightness Friday, but he should be fine to play Washington on Sunday night, Coach JIM FASSEL said.</p>
