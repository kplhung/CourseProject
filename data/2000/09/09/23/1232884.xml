        <p>This 30-second commercial, titled ''Congress,'' was released yesterday by Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for United States Senate from New Jersey. It is being broadcast on television stations in New York and Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Shrum, Devine &amp; Donilon.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial begins with what for many New Jersey voters may be the first glimpse of Mr. Corzine's Republican opponent, Representative Bob Franks, apparently taken from a recent television interview. He is introduced in one corner of the screen, opposite old footage of former Speaker Newt Gingrich speaking from the House floor. Mr. Gingrich, jabbing his finger in the air, is shown in slow motion, so he seems to be shouting menacingly. Mr. Franks, meanwhile, is shown in even slower motion and in tight focus, shaking his head as if saying an emphatic no, opposite pictures of a young girl in a wheelchair and an old man paying for prescription drugs. Subtitles amplify the script: ''VOTED to cut Medicare by $270 billion,'' ''VOTED to cut nursing home safety standards,'' ''GIVE $40 billion to insurance companies.'' The commercial ends with an extreme close-up of Mr. Franks, showing only his eyes and nose as he shakes his head. A warning is superimposed: ''With a record like that'' -- here Mr. Franks's face freezes -- ''why would we send him to the Senate?''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Narrator: ''In Congress, Bob Franks joined with Newt Gingrich, voting to cut Medicare by $270 billion. To eliminate federal nursing-home safety standards. To cut Medicaid by $163 billion. He says the answer to the prescription-drug problem is to give a $40 billion taxpayer-financed subsidy to the insurance companies, with no guarantee of prescription drug coverage in return.</p>
        <p>''With a record like that in Congress, why would we send Bob Franks to the Senate?''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Franks voted for the 1995 budget-reconciliation bill, in which House Republicans made good on promises to cut taxes and balance the budget. Included in that bill were reductions in future Medicare and Medicaid spending; the Franks campaign notes that spending for those programs continued to grow, but at a slower pace. The bill also included a provision that would have left it to the states to regulate safety in nursing homes. Mr. Franks's aides say he voted for the bill only because he had assurances that that provision would not survive the House-Senate conference committee. Indeed, the provision was opposed by Senate Republicans and dropped on final passage of the budget bill. As for the prescription drug plan cited, the Republican plan would have the government pay subsidies to insurance companies to encourage them to offer protection that does not now exist, covering drug costs of the elderly and disabled. Democrats opposed to the idea repeatedly cite an insurance executive's assertion that his industry is not interested in selling such insurance.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mr. Corzine is following the playbook he used against former Gov. Jim Florio in the Democratic primary; indeed, this ad is a dead ringer for several commercials in that race, with the same sinister music, the same black background, and the same tight, grainy, slow-motion close-ups of Mr. Corzine's opponent, all intended to present him in an unflattering light. Mr. Corzine, like Hillary Clinton in New York, seeks to demonize his opponent as a bosom buddy of Mr. Gingrich, while trying to align himself with mainstream New Jerseyans on hot-button health-care issues. Mr. Corzine thus begins what will be a seven-week assault on Mr. Franks's record that is likely to be a one-sided battle for some time: Mr. Franks's underfinanced campaign cannot respond in kind.</p>
