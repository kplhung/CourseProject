        <p>The men's shot-put was in its final stages on the first night of Olympic track and field competition, and as the mammoth, barrel-chested men lumbered intensely about the infield, the 110,000 fans in the Olympic Stadium were beside themselves.</p>
        <p>There was a huge roar; thousands of flash bulbs blinked in the night like a swarm of fireflies on a mountain slope and then the roar gradually faded away into a buzz. Australia's Cathy Freeman had just won her first-round heat in the 400 meters.</p>
        <p>''It was nice while it lasted,'' said John Godina of the United States.</p>
        <p>It is not easy being a shot-putter. Not easy being a minor act in a cosmopolitan circus in which sprinters, middle-distance runners and pole vaulters remain the principal attractions. Not easy finally getting the chance to perform in the Olympic spotlight and watching the gold medal go unexpectedly to a bearded, Harley-riding Finn named Arsi Harju.</p>
        <p>''If you would have asked me this morning who would win, I would certainly not have said Arsi,'' Godina said. ''But the guy came out and performed like a champion.''</p>
        <p>After throwing a personal best in qualifying of 70 feet 2 1/4 inches in the morning, Harju threw 69-10 1/4 on his second of six attempts in the final tonight. That was 3 1/4 inches better than the American silver medalist, Adam Nelson (69-7), and 3 1/2 inches better than Godina (69-6 3/4), who won silver in the last Olympics.</p>
        <p>''I was thinking of a medal, but I didn't believe in gold until the end of the last round,'' said Harju, who became the first man from Finland to win the shot-put since 1920 and the first Finn to win a medal in these Olympics.</p>
        <p>While the Finns were ecstatic, Canadian fans were crestfallen after Donovan Bailey, who won the men's 100 meters in the 1996 Games, finished last in his second-round heat and failed to advance to Saturday's semifinal round. Bailey, the world record-holder in the 100 until the American Maurice Greene bettered his mark last year, had managed to return to respectable form after tearing his Achilles' tendon in 1998.</p>
        <p>''I still believe in my heart that if everything went right, I could have won here, but some things you can't control,'' Bailey said.</p>
        <p>It was also a painful evening for the defending Olympic champion in the men's high jump. The American Charles Austin failed to advance to the 13-man final, clearing 7 feet 2 inches.</p>
        <p>The other favorites in the men's and women's 100, including Greene and his compatriot Marion Jones, sailed through the opening two rounds with relative ease. Jones's time was extremely fast for a heat: 10.83 seconds.</p>
        <p>But if Jones remains the favorite in the 100, her self-appointed task of winning five gold medals continues to grow more complicated. Two of the women who were supposed to help her win the 4x100 relay are struggling: Inger Miller is uncertain to compete because of a strained hamstring; and Torri Edwards, who replaced Miller in the 100 tonight, failed to advance past the second round. And one of Jones's prospective 4x400 relay teammates, Michelle Collins, also failed to get past the first round in the 400.</p>
        <p>Freeman's goal remains the 400-meter gold, and tonight she opened her campaign successfully. But Marie-Jose Perec's lane was left empty in the next 400 heat. Perec, the French star and defending Olympic champion, fled Sydney on Tuesday night, after an intruder reportedly broke into her room and threatened her. Although Perec's name was still on the start list tonight in Sydney, she had, by then, already landed in Paris.</p>
        <p>As for Harju, until tonight he was not even considered the best shot-putter in Finland. Even though he won the national championship last month, he did so in the absence of the injured and more highly regarded Mika Halvari. Until now, Harju had never competed in a world championship final or the Olympics.</p>
        <p>Nelson was also on a grand stage for the first time. At 6 feet and 250 pounds, he is small for a world-class shot-putter; Godina is 6-4 and 285. Yet with the help of Bob Weir, a British shot-putter who is an assistant track coach at Stanford University, Nelson has honed his skills.</p>
        <p>Though his personal best coming into this season was 67-8 3/4 , he won the Olympic trials in Sacramento, Calif., with a remarkable throw of 72-7, which was the longest in the world for four years. Nelson then finished first in four of the year's five remaining Golden League meets in Europe. But tonight, he could not get it to go nearly as far as he did at the trials.</p>
        <p>''I was thinking Sacramento, Sacramento, please be like Sacramento,'' he said. ''To be honest, the pressure started getting to me a little today. But I'm very happy with the way I placed in my first major championships.</p>
        <p>''The three things I'm most proud of: I'm here. I'm clean. I got a silver medal.''</p>
        <p>Harju's winning throw was the shortest at an Olympics since 1984, but tonight's medalists said that was a reason to celebrate, not commiserate. ''Drug testing works,'' Godina said. ''Nobody in this group has had a positive drug test, and that's something to be proud about.''</p>
