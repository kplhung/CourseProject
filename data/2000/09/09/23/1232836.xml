        <p>Karl-Heinz Kalbfell carefully held a cast-iron sculpture of the Rolls-Royce hood ornament, the ''flying lady'' who reaches into the wind and whose feet seem to lift off the ground.</p>
        <p>As director of Project Rolls-Royce at the German automaker Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G., Mr. Kalbfell is planning to introduce an entirely new line of Britain's most prestigious name in cars. But thanks to a stalemate between BMW and Volkswagen A.G., which both wanted to buy Rolls-Royce two years ago, he has to wait until 2003, when Volkswagen will relinquish control over the celebrated name.</p>
        <p>''It is a little strange,'' he admitted. ''We came into a situation which was indeed unique. But we have to cope with that.''</p>
        <p>Unique does not begin to describe the challenge. Until BMW acquires the name, Mr. Kalbfell is not supposed to even pose in front of current Rolls-Royce models, much less promote them in any way. And even when it gets the name, BMW will not be inheriting any factories and will not be manufacturing current models like Silver Seraph or Corniche. Instead, it has designed an entirely new car, which has not been shown in public. The only things certain to remain the same will be the flying lady, the distinctive Rolls front grille, and price tags that begin at about $210,000.</p>
        <p>All this stems from a Solomon-like deal in which Volkswagen and BMW essentially split the British company in two. Beginning in 2003, BMW will get rights to the Rolls-Royce name and its icons. But Volkswagen acquired the factories and the entire operations of Bentley Motor Cars, the sportier but equally expensive line of cars that accounts for about two-thirds of Rolls-Royce sales.</p>
        <p>It is not yet clear which company was more clever: Is it BMW, which paid $65 million for the name, or Volkswagen, which paid $780 million for the company?</p>
        <p>It is clear that BMW plans to start Rolls-Royce as an entirely new operation. It will not produce current models, though it may well use the names. Nor will it use the same engines or chassis.</p>
        <p>''We will be starting from scratch,'' Mr. Kalbfell said in a recent interview at BMW headquarters here. ''We want to make sure that the way we market is in the good tradition of Rolls-Royce. But at the same time, and this is very important, too, it has to be in a direction that is right for the future.''</p>
        <p>To smooth the transition, Volkswagen has agreed to produce the Silver Seraph after 2003 if there is demand. But Volkswagen is more interested in competing with Rolls-Royce than supporting it, and BMW does not want to pay Volkswagen for making its cars.</p>
        <p>Neither BMW nor Volkswagen wanted to split up Rolls-Royce. Both wanted to buy the entire company when its former parent, Vickers P.L.C., put it up for auction in 1998.</p>
        <p>But the two essentially trapped each other. Volkswagen trumped BMW's bid by offering $780 million for the company, which produces fewer than 2,000 cars a year at prices of $210,000 to $360,000 apiece.</p>
        <p>BMW struck back by capturing claims on the name itself. It did so by striking a deal with Rolls-Royce P.L.C., the aircraft engine manufacturer that had split off from the car company years earlier.</p>
        <p>Rolls-Royce P.L.C. had the right to block a transfer of the coveted name to non-British owners, and agreed to sell the right to BMW for $65 million.  After weeks of furtive negotiations, Volkswagen agreed to surrender the name to BMW and focus on the Bentley as its lead luxury car.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kalbfell is not the kind of person who would normally drive a Rolls-Royce. He created BMW's motor sport division, which makes racing versions of its road cars and other specialized sport vehicles. He also orchestrated BMW's re-entry into Formula One racing several years ago.</p>
        <p>Despite Rolls-Royce's association with history and tradition, BMW executives decided they had no choice but to build a new company from the ground up. They say it would be impractical to adopt what is essentially a built-by-hand production of the existing models to a new line of cars. And they argue that Rolls-Royce cars were due for a makeover anyway.</p>
        <p>Though Vickers had rescued Rolls-Royce from bankruptcy, it kept the company on a tight budget for developing new models. To keep costs down, the company began buying engines and many other components made by BMW.</p>
        <p>But BMW's engines were designed for speed and acceleration, not for the silent smooth ride of a car created for people with chauffeurs.</p>
        <p>''The idea to adapt BMW engines was something of a mistake, and it was one that I think was recognized by executives in the company,'' said Philip Hall, chief executive of the Sir Henry Royce Memorial Foundation, a nonprofit organization that keeps extensive archives on Rolls-Royce.</p>
        <p>Indeed, sales of Rolls-Royce cars dropped 26 percent in 1999, from 600 cars to just 444. Part of the reason stemmed from the high value of the British pound, which made the cars extremely expensive on the Continent. But given that Bentley sales declined only 1.8 percent, the fall also reflected unhappiness among consumers and lack of interest by VW.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Kalbfells's first decisions was to stop using BMW engines, and come up with something similar to the big V-8 engines that powered Rolls-Royces for nearly 40 years.</p>
        <p>''What we intend to do is integrate all the available competence of the BMW group, but that doesn't mean that it will be made from BMW parts,'' Mr. Kalbfell said.</p>
        <p>But engines are comparatively simple to select. Far more delicate is coming up with a design that still evokes Rolls-Royce's history while avoiding the cars' increasingly fusty image.</p>
        <p>Upon taking over Project Rolls-Royce, Mr. Kalbfell assembled a group of designers from California, Britain and Germany under the leadership of a Scottish engineer, Ian Cameron.</p>
        <p>The group was divided into competing teams and leased offices in a bank building near Hyde Park. Mr. Kalbfell picked the location because it has one of the highest rates of Rolls-Royce ownership in England.</p>
        <p>''We wanted them to become immersed in the culture,'' Mr. Kalbfell said. ''We needed to get away from the influence of the R &amp; D Center here in Munich.''</p>
        <p>BMW designers pored over archives at the Rolls-Royce foundation. They also courted Rolls-Royce dealers and owners' clubs, especially in England and the United States.</p>
        <p>BMW says it has now selected a design and built a prototype car, but it has not shown it yet to people outside the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kalbfell has also laid plans for a new factory in Goodwood, in the south of England far away from Rolls-Royce's old home in Derby, central England. The company will employ about 350 people and be able to produce about 1,000 cars a year.</p>
        <p>By comparison with Volkswagen, BMW's plans are cautious. Volkswagen is spending several billion dollars on expansion and plans to introduce new series of ''midpriced'' Bentleys. Volkswagen's goal is to increase Bentley sales tenfold, to about 10,000 cars a year.</p>
        <p>But BMW is still reeling from its last catastrophe in Britain, the disastrous acquisition of Rover Cars. After losing $6 billion over six years, BMW essentially gave away most of Rover last spring and ignited widespread wrath in England for what was viewed as reneging on its commitments.</p>
        <p>Rolls-Royce is a much smaller challenge. Despite its reputation as a producer of cars for royalty, rock stars and the simply rich, Rolls-Royce is an infinitesimally small company that produces fewer than 600 cars a year.</p>
        <p>And there will be competition. DaimlerChrysler will be introducing the Maybach limousine, bigger and more expensive than even the biggest Mercedes, in 2003. And Volkswagen, in addition to expanding Bentley, is also pushing high-end sports cars from Lamborghini and Bugatti.</p>
        <p>Rolls-Royce enthusiasts are waiting to see what emerges. But many Rolls-Royce car dealers have to decide whether to side with Bentley or Rolls-Royce.</p>
        <p>Though Bentley and Rolls-Royce had already drifted apart in distribution, as many as a quarter of Rolls-Royce dealers in Britain still handle the Bentley as well.</p>
        <p>In England, the two biggest dealers in Rolls-Royce and Bentley -- H. R. Owen and Jack Barclay -- decided to merge this month. The combined company will market both lines of luxury automobiles, but it will separate them into two dealership operations.</p>
        <p>''We do not see them being sold alongside one another,'' said Nicholas Lancaster, the president of H. R. Owen.</p>
        <p>Other dealers will have to decide which way to go. But given that Volkswagen's goal is to sell 10,000 Bentleys a year, compared with BMW's goal of 1,000 Rolls-Royces, more are likely to stay with Volkswagen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lancaster is ready for both rivals. ''We are in an age when more people are becoming rich than ever before,'' he remarked. ''The choices are so small at the very top range of these vehicles that there is definitely room for more.''</p>
