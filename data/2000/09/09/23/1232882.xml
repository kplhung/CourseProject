        <p>Battered by weeks of criticism and his own missteps, Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic multimillionaire running for Senate from New Jersey, moved sharply today to change the subject with a barrage of new attack advertisements aimed at his little-known Republican rival, Representative Bob Franks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who spent $18 million for TV commercials in the Democratic primary, has been adding to that record sum at a pace of more than $1.2 million a week since Labor Day weekend -- not including about $2 million in ads during telecasts of the Olympics.

        <p>Battered by weeks of criticism and his own missteps, Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic multimillionaire running for Senate from New Jersey, moved sharply today to change the subject with a barrage of new attack advertisements aimed at his little-known Republican rival, Representative Bob Franks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who spent $18 million for TV commercials in the Democratic primary, has been adding to that record sum at a pace of more than $1.2 million a week since Labor Day weekend -- not including about $2 million in ads during telecasts of the Olympics. But while television viewers have been bombarded with sleek commercials describing Mr. Corzine's platform, he has struggled mightily to gain a footing in the rough-and-tumble of daily campaigning.</p>
        <p>For weeks, Mr. Franks, unable to afford television commercials of his own, has kept Mr. Corzine on the defensive about his finances, his charitable giving to groups whose leaders later endorsed him, and his spotty voting record. Mr. Corzine has contributed to his own problems by making a series of misstatements, dragging his feet before disclosing his charitable gifts, and refusing to release his personal tax returns.</p>
        <p>With the release of the new commercials, however, Mr. Corzine's campaign suggested he would do his best to put the past three weeks, and those subjects, behind him. ''I think he's said all he's going to say about that,'' said Tom Shea, Mr. Corzine's spokesman. ''Jon's said all along, he is going to talk about the issues, and that's what he's doing.''</p>
        <p>The commercials, which focus on Mr. Franks's voting record on health care issues, reprise a Democratic tactic that has become almost a cliche: trying to link Mr. Franks to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.</p>
        <p>They note that Mr. Franks voted with Republicans in Congress in 1995 to reduce Medicare and Medicaid spending and to eliminate federal safety standards for nursing homes. They also refer to Mr. Franks's vote in June for a Republican prescription-drug plan that Democrats denounced as a sham and a hoax.</p>
        <p>''With a record like that in Congress,'' the commercials conclude, ''why would we send Bob Franks to the Senate?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks's campaign responded tonight by dismissing Mr. Corzine's new strategem as a sign of desperation.</p>
        <p>''This is what wealthy candidates do,'' said Charlie Smith, the Franks campaign manager. ''Jon Corzine's spent millions trying to sell himself. It obviously wasn't working. And so he'll spend millions on negative attack ads.''</p>
        <p>''His campaign has obviously got some serious problems,'' Mr. Smith continued. ''They've got a candidate who has consistently given untruthful answers to simple questions. He's mired in a scandal where a charitable foundation's been used to purchase endorsements. And he's obviously failed to develop an inspired following. While people know who he is, people don't seem inclined to be excited about the potential of a radical, big-government senator from New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine disclosed on Monday that his family's charitable foundation had made more than $100,000 in gifts to groups whose leaders or sponsors later endorsed him, along with hundreds of thousands more in donations to groups that wield political influence of one kind or another, like the Archdiocese of Newark and Planned Parenthood of Northern New Jersey.</p>
        <p>He has denied that the gifts were used to buy influence. But on Thursday, he wrongly told a group of college students, in a program taped for television, that one widely questioned gift had been made before he became a candidate.</p>
        <p>In any case, one of Mr. Corzine's advisers conceded that the new commercial was timed to shift the public's attention. ''We're ready for a new horse,'' the adviser said, ''because the other one has been beaten sufficiently, and it's dead.''</p>
        <p>David P. Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University, said that Mr. Corzine's shift to the attack seemed a bit early, but understandably so. ''It'll take some pressure off the Corzine campaign because of the flub-ups of the last week or two,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he, like Mr. Franks's aides, questioned the use of Mr. Gingrich as a bludgeon. Peter DeMarco, Mr. Franks's spokesman, said that had been tried in 1996 and 1998 by the Congressman's Democratic challengers, to little effect.</p>
        <p>Said Mr. Rebovich: ''Any congressional Republican this side of Mother Teresa is going to be colored as an ultraconservative clone of Newt Gingrich. It's something Franks has to overcome. His pitch -- that he's a knowledgeable, experienced politician who knows how to do the right things in Washington for New Jersey -- that's kind of a nuanced position that's hard to get through in a cluttered media environment in a presidential election year. Even if you have money.''</p>
