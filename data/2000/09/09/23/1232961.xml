        <p>CANTOR-Herbert. 87, of Levittown, N.Y., died September 21, 2000 after a brief illness. A good, kind man, smart and funny, he was much loved by Millie, his wife of 54 years, children Phil, Mady and Dan, children-in-law Carrie, Arthur and Laura, and grandchildren Max, Nate, Tess, Eli, Ethan and Alice. A WWII veteran and lifelong Democrat, he owned Valley Stream Auto Parts for 30 years, and was a member of the Israel Cantor Family Society which was founded at his birth. A passionate follower of the events of the day and a partisan of fairness and decency throughout his life, he leaves a legacy of devotion to family and friends, of generosity without strings, and a marvelous sense of humor. He will be missed. Funeral Sunday, September 24, 12 noon, I.J. Morris, 46 Greenwich St, Hempstead. Visit www.cantorfamily.org</p>
