        <p>The entire Bulgarian weight-lifting team was expelled from the Olympics today in a drug scandal, paving the way for the United States to win its first gold medal in the sport in 40 years.</p>
        <p>The team expulsion was the second of the Games for weight lifting, whose credibility has been severely compromised by repeated scandals through the years and whose future in the Games has been threatened.</p>
        <p>The Romanian team was booted from the Olympics last week as part of a ''three strikes rule,'' which means automatic expulsion for an entire team if three of its athletes test positive for banned substances in one year.</p>
        <p>The four Romanian lifters who did not test positive were later allowed back into the Games after Romanian Olympic officials agreed to pay a $50,000 fine, in accordance with the rules of the International Weightlifting Federation, the sport's world governing body. However, federation officials said that the Bulgarians would not be given the option of paying a fine.</p>
        <p>''They have brought the sport of weight lifting into worthless repute,'' Sam Coffa, the federation vice president, told reporters.</p>
        <p>Two Bulgarian lifters tested positive for the diuretic furosemide, according the International Olympic Committee. It was the same diuretic that two Bulgarian gold medalists were caught using at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea. The entire Bulgarian weight-lifting team withdrew from those Games. Diuretics help athletes lose fluids to make weight, but they can also help mask the presence of banned drugs like steroids.</p>
        <p>Izabela Dragneva, the first female weight-lifting gold medalist ever in the Olympics, and the men's bronze medalist, Sevdalin Minchev, tested positive for the diuretic, and were stripped of their medals, the I.O.C. said. On Wednesday, Ivan Ivanov, who won a silver in the 123-pound division, was expelled for testing positive after also testing positive for furosemide.</p>
        <p>The gold medal in the women's 105-pound division will now go to Tara Nott of Stilwell, Kan., who finished second to Dragneva. It is the first gold by an American since Chuck Vinci won the 123-pound division at the 1960 Rome Olympics. Nott said she was ''kind of in shock'' at having been awarded the gold medal.</p>
        <p>''Someday we will have a level playing field,'' she said, ''and myself and others will be able to win on the platform rather than after a drug test.''</p>
        <p>The latest embarrassments could jeopardize weight lifting's future in the Olympics. After the 1988 Seoul Games, Dick Pound, a powerful I.O.C. member from Montreal, suggested that weight lifting be banned until it could prove that it had seriously tackled the issue of performance-enhancing drugs. Weight lifting's international governing body responded by changing all of its weight classes after the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain, thus expunging all world and Olympic records.</p>
        <p>Pound, who is also head of the World Anti-Doping Agency, created by the I.O.C. in the wake of the doping scandal at the 1998 Tour de France, said he would not recommend expulsion of the sport at this point, but warned that the doping problem must be brought under control.</p>
        <p>''As long as they're doing their best under difficult circumstances, I wouldn't kick them out,'' he said, referring to the federation. ''But clearly they have to intensify their effort. The embarrassing situations with Bulgaria and Romania have got to be a concern to them.''</p>
        <p>Michael Cohen, coach of the American women's team, said the Bulgarian case was one of stupidity. ''The drug they were caught with is so easy to detect,'' he said, ''it's like standing on the platform waving a big red flag.''</p>
