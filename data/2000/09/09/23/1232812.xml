        <p>Sixty-four years ago, George Nissen, an accomplished tumbler and diver, watched a circus trapeze artist drop safely into a net and ricochet back.</p>
        <p>He went home, gathered some scrap metal from a bed frame, grabbed a long piece of conveyor-belt material and hooked a few used bedsprings to the sides. When the springs failed to provide the elasticity he wanted, he cut out the inner tube of worn tires.</p>
        <p>Asked if there were any casualties with those first trampolines, Nissen, the man who invented the apparatus in 1936 said, ''Surprisingly, no.''</p>
        <p>''But we did have a few times when the material split down the center and people went through. We found some stronger stuff.''</p>
        <p>On Friday night at the Super Dome, Nissen, 86, watched his recreational toy transform into an Olympic sport. More than six decades after he constructed the first trampoline in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a pixie of a Russian woman named Irina Karavaeva pinned her chestnut hair back with barrettes. She smiled sweetly, pounced some 20 feet in the air, somersaulted, pirouetted and jumped even higher, straight toward the sport's inaugural gold medal.</p>
        <p>The ballerina in the sky and 11 other competitors gave Olympic wings to Nissen's lifelong dream. ''I've been waiting 50 years for this,'' said Nissen in slow, measured tones before the competition.</p>
        <p>From 1947 through 1964, trampoline was included as an event in gymnastics competition by the Amateur Athletic Union and the National Collegiate Athletic Association. It took longer to crack the Olympic program.</p>
        <p>''The political process slowed it down,'' Nissen said, adding that 12 trampolines were waiting to be used in the Moscow Games in 1980, but that a United States boycott forced officials to drop the planned demonstration sport.</p>
        <p>Respect has also been a long time coming for competitors. ''I used to hear, 'How high can you jump into the tree in your backyard?' '' said Robyn Forbes, the Australian entrant. ''But maybe that's starting to change.''</p>
        <p>Trampolining is just one of several new sports that are pushing the boundaries of traditional Olympic competition, while adding an X Games sensibility. In the new synchronized diving discipline at the Sydney International Aquatic Center, divers will perform side by side, spinning and flipping in tandem. In the springboard, they dive off different boards. In the platform, they leap from the same tower. How do they get in sync? ''We say, '1-2-3, go,' '' said the American diver Jenny Keim. ''Really.''</p>
        <p>And this weekend, on rolling suburban farmland west of Sydney, the mountain bike competition will make its second appearance in the Olympics following its debut in 1996. Riders will climb over hilly terrain and drop down a steep gully in a rugged race that features many spills and blowouts.</p>
        <p>And on Rushcutters Bay, the 49er dinghy is making its Olympic debut as the newest class in sailing. The double-handed, high-performance skiff is a direct descendant of the wild Aussie 18's, the extremely light dinghy class that grew to prominence on the harbor.</p>
        <p>In the trampoline and beyond, it seems, there is only one prerequisite for participants: the edgier, the better.</p>
        <p>Karavaeva leapt higher and was more acrobatic tonight than most of her competitors, earning a final-round score of 38.90 from the five judges, two of whom gave her 9.0's. She narrowly edged Oxana Tsyhuleva of Ukraine (37.70), the silver medalist, and Karen Cockburn (37.40) of Canada, the bronze medalist.</p>
        <p>No one fell off, but Anna Dogonadze of Germany illustrated the dangerous side of the sport. Competitive trampolines are larger and more powerful than backyard models, able to propel athletes as high as 30 feet. Dogonadze kept spinning toward the edge of the trampoline in her finals routine, until she hit the retainer pad on the left side, forcing her to end her routine abruptly and finish with a final-round score of only 5.0.</p>
        <p>The lone United States competitor, Jennifer Parilla, 19, barely missed the finals by finishing ninth in the compulsories. Her blonde hair pulled tightly back, she wore a metallic silver leotard.</p>
        <p>''My mom calls me the silver bullet,'' Parilla said. An avid snow boarder, she added, ''Now that would be cool, if I did these Games and the Winter Games.''</p>
        <p>Karavaeva enjoyed her moment. She wore an understated white nylon leotard, with a few ice-blue sequins sewn over her heart. Holding court for much of the major Russian news media, she said coyly through a translator, ''I hope this opens a lot of doors for my future.''</p>
        <p>Unlike artistic gymnasts, trampolinists can compete well into their 20's and 30's. The average age of the top 10 competitors in the world is 25. Two members of the United States men's team are in their 30's. Dogonadze and Natalya Karpenkova of Belarus have children, an unheard-of luxury in gymnastics.</p>
        <p>With the Olympics as a springboard, perhaps trampoline has a chance to catapult beyond its meager beginnings. After the first portable model, Nissen later sold them to United States Air Force flight schools before World War II and more recently to NASA for astronaut training. He could be seen in those grainy physical-education movies with a crew cut, trumpeting his product to grade schools.</p>
        <p>Nissen barnstormed the world, bounding in front of the pyramids or with a kangaroo in the background. Asked if he could be referred to as a carnival-barking promoter, he said: ''You can call me anything. I did it.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, at age 84, he performed a flawless back flip at a competition in Switzerland.</p>
        <p>''I wish they had got him up in front of the crowd,'' Forbes said. ''You know, he can still actually bounce. He can do some somersaults. He's a quite funny guy.''</p>
