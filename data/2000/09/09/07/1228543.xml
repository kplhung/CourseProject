        <p>Higher interest rates don't seem to be helping.</p>
        <p>The euro, born amid optimism some 20 months ago, suffered the worst day of its young life yesterday, as it lost 2.3 percent of its value against the dollar, settling at 87.01 cents.</p>
        <p>The European currency also hit a record low against the Japanese yen as it briefly traded below 92 yen.</p>
        <p>It was just over a week ago, on Aug. 31, that the European Central Bank raised interest rates for the sixth time in a year. The central bank then expressed concern over the ''protracted depreciation'' of the euro, which is down 26.5 percent against the dollar since Jan. 4, 1999, the first business day for the euro -- the currency of 11 European countries.</p>
        <p>The euro has long since come to seem quite cheap by many measures, like purchasing power parity, but that has not helped the currency to rally. Nor have higher interest rates helped.</p>
        <p>The theory is that higher interest rates help to bring in money to an economy, but while that may be true in some circumstances, it is not helping now.</p>
        <p>Part of the story is that the United States has also been raising interest rates as well, but the other part of the story is that it is not debt investments that now drive investment flows. It is the equity investments, both through stock purchases and direct foreign investments, that have driven the dollar up and the euro down.</p>
        <p>It is in that environment that the dollar has performed well despite a high and growing current account deficit.</p>
        <p>That deficit, largely driven by the trade deficit, must be financed by foreigners willingly reinvesting the money in dollar-denominated assets. So far they have been more than willing to do so.</p>
        <p>Given that current reality, the best course if Europe wants to support its common currency would seem to be to make itself more attractive for equity investors, and to some extent it has done so. European growth is at its highest levels in a decade, albeit still below growth in the United States. ''I am very impressed by European corporate restructuring,'' said Nicholas P. Sargen, global market strategist for J. P. Morgan's private clients. He compared the restructuring to that embarked upon by many United States companies in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>In addition, Germany is overhauling its tax structure in a way that is widely viewed as attractive to foreign investment and is likely to be imitated by other European countries.</p>
        <p>But none of that has been enough to make European investments seem more attractive than American ones, and raising interest rates may hurt if it threatens to slow growth and thereby make equity investments less attractive.</p>
        <p>''If you are tightening because your currency is weak, and your real economy and markets are also weak, it is not going to work,'' Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig Securities, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The euro has not been helped by the fact that while it is one currency, it has 11 governments. There have been efforts to get those 11 governments to show solidarity in defense of the currency, but in fact some Europeans like a weak currency. European exports are booming, in part because of the falling euro, and that eases pressures for structural reforms to European economies that are strongly resisted by European unions, among others.</p>
        <p>''The current euro-dollar rate is more of a reason to be happy than concerned,'' said Gerhard Schroder, the German chancellor, in a speech on Monday that helped to provoke the latest decline.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's German economic data showed some of the results of the weak euro. Unemployment fell to its lowest level in five years, although it still remains at 9.5 percent of the work force, in part because of strong factory orders from abroad. ''The export orders were very strong,'' noted John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange at ING-Barings Capital Markets.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McCarthy said there was nonetheless a wave of selling of the euro from Americans after it became clear that the currency was moving decisively below 89 cents, the area where it bottomed in May before rallying back above 96 cents in June. The currency had ended Tuesday's trading at 89.06 cents.</p>
        <p>When the euro was introduced, there were widespread predictions it would be a strong currency, continuing the historic role of the German mark.</p>
        <p>But the current level of the euro is equivalent to a value of 2.24 marks to the dollar -- the highest level for the dollar since 1986, when the dollar was falling from historically overvalued levels.</p>
        <p>At the time, interest-rate-denominated investments were much more important in driving currency flows, and American interest rates had fallen sharply. In addition, the American economy was slowing.</p>
        <p>In the end, the euro's weakness may end only when American investments come to seem less attractive, either because American markets are falling rapidly or because the American economy appears to be in danger of a recession. Neither possibility seems very likely to investors at the moment.</p>
