        <p>AFTER a week immersed in Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions, I found strange thoughts bubbling up in my head.</p>
        <p>After I noticed that I had left my computer on all night, I wondered, fleetingly, if I could rig up a boxing glove on a spring to hit the off button at an appointed hour.

        <p>AFTER a week immersed in Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions, I found strange thoughts bubbling up in my head.</p>
        <p>After I noticed that I had left my computer on all night, I wondered, fleetingly, if I could rig up a boxing glove on a spring to hit the off button at an appointed hour. When I inadvertently disabled an electrical socket in the bedroom and couldn't immediately figure out how to turn it on again, it flickered through my mind that if that had happened in the game, I would have been able to restore power with a laser that matched the color of the dead socket's faceplate.</p>
        <p>And when one of the cats solemnly presented me with its latest catch from the backyard, it occurred to me in passing that the poor mouse would have had a better chance reaching safety with the help of some explosives.</p>
        <p>So absorbing is this puzzle game, the first new Incredible Machine game in five years, that ruminations inspired by its more than 250 graphical conundrums have been intruding regularly upon the real world. I don't mind. It is a tribute to the game's homey appeal and its challenge, as well as a signal that this celebrated series has lost none of its ability to charm and infuriate.</p>
        <p>Like its five predecessors, Contraptions is inspired by the ramshackle inventions of Rube Goldberg, a cartoonist, sculptor and author who died in 1970 and is best known for his parodies of mankind's attempts to build ever-more-elaborate mousetraps.</p>
        <p>In the game, you assemble makeshift machines from objects ordinary (flashlights and magnifying glasses) and fantastic (anti-gravity pads) to achieve mundane results. (A mouse reaches its hole. A candle is lighted. Fireworks are launched.) These ostensibly labor-saving devices are peculiarly labor intensive. Balls drop to turn power on and off, start toasters and balance teeter-totters. Lasers power electrical sockets and light candles. A cat frightens a mouse, which runs in its cage on a wheel that turns a fan belt, which sets another mechanism in motion. The shortest distance between two points is never a straight line.</p>
        <p>In one puzzle, for instance, I was assigned to bop an animated baboon on the head with a steel ball. This contraption kicked into action when a ball, different from the one that would hit the baboon, dropped onto a springy platform and started bouncing, going higher each time. It finally caromed off an angled corner and hit a pair of shears. The shears snapped closed, cutting a cord that suspended a leaky can of paint above a detonator. The explosion that resulted when the falling can pressed the detonator's plunger blew out the bottom of a nearby bin, which freed a little boy inside. He walked down a ramp and onto a teeter-totter, pushing one side down onto the handle of an air pump. The blast of air set in motion a pinwheel, a fan belt connected to the pinwheel, a treadmill at the other end of the fan belt and a steel ball that had been resting on the treadmill. The ball zipped off to the right, where it clunked the innocent monkey.</p>
        <p>The baboon rubbed its head, not hurt in any serious way, and the puzzle was complete. I'd meant to take a break here, but I started the next puzzle instead. It was only a click away. Once you've started playing Contraptions, it's awfully hard to stop. Since you can use the included construction kit to create your own puzzles and can import new ones created by other players, the game needn't end.</p>
        <p>This particular puzzle was rated by the game as of medium difficulty and seemed relatively easy. But as you progress through the game, you increasingly find that the toolkit allotted to a particular task appears to be a tool or two short. That's usually a clue that one piece has to perform more than one function, sometimes a function unrelated to its obvious purpose. For example, on one level I found that pipe segments that accelerate whatever passes through them were more effectively used when they were piled up as steps so a ball could bounce down them. In that way, the puzzles extend into the supplies you are given to solve a problem.</p>
        <p>And as they say in advertising, positioning is everything. You not only have to select the correct tools to complete the gadget on the screen, but you must also tweak their orientation or settings. For example, you can adjust the clock on the egg timer for situations that require time delays. And you must often put objects in precisely the right spots to achieve the necessary end. Once you hit the Start button to set the contraption in motion, you can't intercede further.</p>
        <p>The creators, much to their credit, have not rendered Contraptions in three dimensions, as often happens with updates of older games. An Incredible Machine reinvented as an environment might raise the conceptual questions that Incredible Machine as a game never raises. (Mine is not to question why; mine is simply to enjoy myself.) The graphics are more detailed than in previous games, but the game remains distinctly low tech and straightforward. The familiarity of the household objects in the toolkit, the small scale (each puzzle is confined to a single screen) and the on-screen hints leave the impression of manageability.</p>
        <p>But their execution is quite another matter. Contraptions can be utterly maddening. I must have spent hours staring into the screen to figure out why a balloon steadfastly refused to float through a hole I'd created with a rocket. That reverie was broken only when the real world intruded upon the game world -- hot, heavy breath on my thigh and a steady, long-lashed gaze from the largest of my dogs told me that it was time for their dinner. I left the game and made my way downstairs to the kitchen.</p>
        <p>But on the way, I confess, I wondered how I could deliver food into their dishes without leaving my chair.</p>
