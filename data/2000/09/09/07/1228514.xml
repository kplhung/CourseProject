        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Henry Schleiff, the chairman and chief executive of Court TV, defends his ''real confessions'' program by calling it transparent (Op-Ed, Sept. 5). There's both ''manufactured'' and ''unmanufactured'' reality television, he argues, and this is the real thing. But when cameras and law mix, confusion between reality and fiction abounds.</p>
        <p>Real confessions promise powerful emotional immediacy. That has always been a reliable formula for television ratings. But what insight do they provide? What do we really know of the men and women or the circumstances of the crimes at issue? Criminal confessions deliver viewers to advertisers on the strength of outrage and contempt.</p>

        <p>An unfortunate byproduct of this commercial exploitation is that people treat it as real. Thus, reality TV, real-life criminal justice policies and perhaps even real jury verdicts dissolve into one another.</p>
