        <p>Armando Benitez throws heat. Every hitter knows it, and every hitter has to expect it. When the Mets' closer came into the game with the bases loaded and one out in the eighth inning today, protecting a one-run lead, he had to throw the fastball.</p>
        <p>''It's a real tough situation coming in with the bases loaded and one out,'' Benitez said. ''You have to come in with your best pitch. You don't want to throw a couple of pitches and make a mistake. He looked for the pitch he wanted. He had to look for my best pitch.''</p>

        <p>Armando Benitez throws heat. Every hitter knows it, and every hitter has to expect it. When the Mets' closer came into the game with the bases loaded and one out in the eighth inning today, protecting a one-run lead, he had to throw the fastball.</p>
        <p>''It's a real tough situation coming in with the bases loaded and one out,'' Benitez said. ''You have to come in with your best pitch. You don't want to throw a couple of pitches and make a mistake. He looked for the pitch he wanted. He had to look for my best pitch.''</p>
        <p>Benitez tried to throw his fastball outside. But it came in high over the middle of the plate, and Benito Santiago belted it over the fence in left-center field for a grand slam, the crushing blow in an 11-8 comeback victory for the Cincinnati Reds at Cinergy Field.</p>
        <p>Benitez, who had allowed 1 earned run in his previous 31 outings, was philosophical. ''Sometimes we're human, no?'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the human frailties are showing up at the same time on the roster. The Mets limped home having lost five of six games on a road trip that began Sept. 1, a date that has heralded doom for the team three years in a row.</p>
        <p>They missed the playoffs by losing their last five games in 1998. They dropped seven in a row late last season before returning from the brink of elimination.</p>
        <p>Now this.</p>
        <p>The Mets are taking comfort in the standings: after the Braves' 7-1 victory over the Diamondbacks last night, the Mets had a five-game lead over Arizona in the National League wild-card race and trailed Atlanta by two games in the National League East.</p>
        <p>''I think the guys will shake it off fine,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''We've got plenty of games left to play and we're still sitting O.K.''</p>
        <p>Bobby J. Jones, who started today's game and could not get an out in the third, agreed.</p>
        <p>''The good thing is we've still got a good lead in the wild card and we're right there in reach of the Braves,'' Jones said. ''Sure, it's a disappointing road trip, and every team has streaks like this. But we were right in all these games.''</p>
        <p>In a way, that made this trip harder to take. Matt Franco hit a three-run homer in the first inning and Todd Pratt homered in the second, but Jones could not hold a 5-2 lead. Bobby M. Jones relieved with four one-hit, shutout innings after the Reds tied the game, 5-5, but the Mets led by 8-5 before the eighth.</p>
        <p>''That was a slow game, a bad start for both teams, but we had the opportunity to put them away, and we let up,'' said Lenny Harris, who started at first base. ''We didn't put them away like we're supposed to, like we did last month when we were putting teams away. We just have to get that fire back, and hopefully we'll get it down the stretch.''</p>
        <p>After Bobby M. Jones's outstanding effort, in which he changed speeds effectively with a sinking, turnover fastball he had never thrown with confidence before, Dennis Cook pitched a scoreless seventh. Turk Wendell came on in the eighth and got one out, but he allowed two singles and Valentine called for John Franco.</p>
        <p>Franco missed two weeks with a sore pectoral muscle before returning on Tuesday, and he felt no discomfort today. He said he had good pop on his fastball and a better changeup, but he missed his spots and the Reds took advantage. Sean Casey and Dmitri Young singled, cutting the Mets' lead to 8-7 and bringing in Benitez. When Benitez allowed the slam, Franco was charged with three earned runs, the first he has given up since June 21.</p>
        <p>''The guy's been automatic all year,'' Franco said of Benitez. ''He comes in and gives up a home run -- big deal. It's a big deal we lost, yeah, but he's been so automatic all year. He made a mistake. It's not going to be the first time. It's not going to be the last time.''</p>
        <p>The problem is, so many Mets are making mistakes in unison. Even in the Mets' lone victory on this trip, they did not hit much. Todd Zeile's game-winning homer in the 10th on Tuesday followed five hitless innings, and the Mets managed just six hits today. Since whacking Arizona's Randy Johnson in a 13-3 victory on Aug. 25, the Mets are hitting .193.</p>
        <p>The Mets do not play Thursday, and on Friday they open a six-game homestand against Philadelphia and Milwaukee. Some players said the off day is a good thing. ''The day off is going to be very important,'' Alfonzo said. Others are not sure.</p>
        <p>''It's going to hurt watching baseball tomorrow,'' said Pratt, who added that he may check out the game between the Braves and the Diamondbacks, ''knowing we had a bad road trip and not being able to do anything until Friday.''</p>
        <p>But if the Mets' minds are flashing back to the last two Septembers, they are not letting on. The players know the comparison will be brought up by the news media, John Franco said, but this is a different year.</p>
        <p>''Last year's last year,'' Franco said. ''It's behind us. There's nothing you can do about that. We've just got to go out and play. You can't worry about last year. If we go back and play the way we played before this road trip, there's going to be no problems. We've got a good enough team to bounce back.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Mets started a lineup of reserves Wednesday, with ROBIN VENTURA (elbow), TODD ZEILE (knee), MIKE PIAZZA (elbow) and EDGARDO ALFONZO (groin) nursing minor injuries. All but Zeile eventually played. . . . ARMANDO BENITEZ has been dominant this year, except with the bases loaded. According to Stats Inc., hitters have four hits in four at-bats off Benitez with the bases loaded this season. Three of the hits were grand slams (by PRESTON WILSON, PAT BURRELL and BENITO SANTIAGO), and the other was a triple. . . . LENNY HARRIS scorched a line-drive triple off the wall in right center in the eighth inning. Harris, who has played in the majors since 1988, said, ''That's the hardest ball I've ever hit.'' . . . Before the Joneses, the only unrelated pitching teammates with the same names since 1900 were BOB G. MILLER and BOB L. MILLER of the 1962 Mets. The Millers pitched in the same game five times, but one never followed the other, as BOBBY M. JONES followed BOBBY J. JONES Wednesday.</p>
