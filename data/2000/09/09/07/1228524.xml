        <p>Uh-oh.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush has come up with a plan to overhaul Medicare.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Uh-oh.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush has come up with a plan to overhaul Medicare.</p>
        <p>This should be interesting. It's always interesting when the foxes roll up their sleeves and start renovating the chicken coop.</p>
        <p>To say that the Republican Party has been hostile to Medicare is to engage in the grossest of understatements. To Ronald Reagan, Medicare was an affront to the very idea of America. Robert Dallek, in his biography of Lyndon Johnson, ''Flawed Giant,'' recalled that Mr. Reagan ''saw Medicare as the advance wave of socialism, which would 'invade every area of freedom in this country.' ''</p>
        <p>''Reagan,'' wrote Mr. Dallek, ''predicted that Medicare would compel Americans to spend their 'sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was like in America when men were free.' ''</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990's, when the Republicans were trying to cut taxes while at the same time eliminating $270 billion in anticipated Medicare expenditures, Bob Dole was bragging about the fact that he had opposed the original Medicare bill in 1965, opting instead to support a voluntary alternative.</p>
        <p>And during that same budget fight, Newt Gingrich, apparently referring to the original fee-for-service version of Medicare that by then had become cherished by the elderly, wisecracked: ''We don't get rid of it in Round One because we don't think it's politically smart.''</p>
        <p>If it had been up to the Republicans there would have been no Medicare. And if you want to conjure up something frightening, think of America without it.</p>
        <p>Now comes Mr. Bush, the G.O.P.'s affable front man for the likes of Trent Lott, Dick Armey and Tom DeLay, and he's suddenly got a plan to fix Medicare. This is the same Mr. Bush whose own state of Texas has not bothered to comply with a 1996 consent decree requiring it to provide appropriate health care services to more than 1.5 million children who were eligible for Medicaid.</p>
        <p>Oh, doctor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's proposed renovation of Medicare includes a prescription drug benefit. That applause you hear is coming from the executives of the drug companies and the insurance industry. They like Mr. Bush's plans. Which should tell you something.</p>
        <p>Rather than providing the elderly with the traditional defined benefits under Medicare, the Texas governor would set up a potentially chaotic system in which private insurers would compete with the government to provide health coverage for the nation's 39 million Medicare beneficiaries. The prescription drug benefit would come largely in the form of a government subsidy to be used to purchase the drug benefit from private insurers.</p>
        <p>A prescription drug benefit was not always a cornerstone of Mr. Bush's presidential campaign. Health care was hardly his strong point, or even a matter of major interest to him. But polls seemed to show that Vice President Al Gore was scoring points by pressing hard for his prescription drug proposal, which would be part of the existing Medicare program and would provide greater benefits to more people.</p>
        <p>It makes a difference whether the drug benefit is contained within an expanded Medicare program (Mr. Gore's proposal) or is farmed out via subsidies to private insurers, as Mr. Bush wants. Ron Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, a nonpartisan, nonprofit advocacy group for health care consumers, discussed this in an interview yesterday:</p>
        <p>''The pharmaceutical industry fears, I think correctly, that if Medicare covers prescription drugs then the Medicare program will use its very significant bargaining clout on behalf of the 39 million beneficiaries to get prices down. So the pharmaceutical industry is apoplectic about the notion of expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's attempt at a better-late-than-never plan, especially one that would turn so many of the certainties of Medicare over to the whims of profit-oriented insurance companies and health maintenance organizations, has many longtime health care advocates worried. The fear is not only that this is not in the best interest of the nation's elderly, but that the compassionately conservative Mr. Bush is following through on the Republicans' decades-long dream of thoroughly undermining Medicare.</p>
