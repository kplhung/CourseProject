        <p>Gov. George W. Bush opened a new line of attack against his Democratic rival today, accusing Vice President Al Gore of making so many promises in this campaign that he would devour the entire $4.6 trillion federal surplus projected for the next decade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush chose to fight on the economy and fiscal policy on a day when Mr. Gore unveiled an ambitious and detailed economic blueprint and called for the creation of a $300 billion rainy day fund to be set aside as an emergency source of money if the economy slows down.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign took out a full page advertisement in some regional editions of USA Today quoting six Nobel laureates and nearly 300 other economists praising Mr. Bush's approach to fiscal policy. The Texas governor also seized on an analysis released by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee, who said the cost of the vice president's programs could be as high as $906 billion more than he has estimated.</p>
        <p>''I want America to add up all the promises my opponent has made,'' Mr. Bush told a crowd at an early morning airport rally in Scranton, Pa. ''All the promises over the course of this campaign. He has the easy style of campaigning. Go to one community and make a promise here, go to another community. When you add it all up, he's spent the entire surplus on bigger government. He won't admit it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush stood before a large blowup poster of the USA Today advertisement and used it to contrast his economic plan with Mr. Gore's.</p>
        <p>''My plan has been endorsed by these Nobel prize winners and leading economists,'' Mr. Bush said. ''His plan has been endorsed by Bill Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's accusations were a mirror image of the Gore campaign's own assertions that it is the Republican candidate who is threatening the surplus because of his proposal to enact a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years, and his spending programs. When Mr. Bush unveiled a $198 billion plan on Tuesday to change the Medicare system, Mr. Gore said, ''There is no money to pay for it if you give away all of the surplus in the form of a giant tax cut for the wealthy.''</p>
        <p>At every campaign rally Mr. Bush is now featuring blue-collar families who he says would receive large reductions under his tax cut plan but would get little to nothing from Mr. Gore's proposals for smaller, more targeted tax cuts for such expenses as college education or home health care.</p>
        <p>''We trust you with your money,'' Mr. Bush told crowds today as he promoted his tax cut in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Indiana. ''We trust you to make decisions with your lives. We don't trust bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. We don't believe in planners and deciders making decisions on behalf of America.''</p>
        <p>At another airport rally here he appropriated Mr. Gore's theme of helping ''working families'' and  thundered, ''Guess which plan is on the side of the working people? It's our plan. It's our plan.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's turn to economic themes today was echoed by his running mate, Dick Cheney, who campaigned before a chamber of commerce in Wilmington, Del. Mr. Cheney said he believed that the economic policies of President Ronald Reagan should get a strong measure of credit for the booming economy of the last eight years.</p>
        <p>Answering a question from a member of the audience, Mr. Cheney compared Mr. Bush's tax cut proposal to Reagan's own income tax cuts of two decades ago, saying it was ''exactly what we did to get this prosperity begun in the first place, back in the early 80's under President Reagan.''</p>
        <p>Later, speaking to reporters, Mr. Cheney said that the boom was created by 20 years of strong leadership of the Federal Reserve Board, reductions in military spending after the cold war and the tax policies of President Reagan and even those of President George Bush.</p>
        <p>''My analysis would be a 20-year look at the economy and policy, not just the last eight years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still later in the day, an aide said Mr. Cheney wanted to clarify that he also gave a measure of credit to President Clinton for ''reluctantly signing'' fiscal measures approved by the Republican Congress,</p>
        <p>The argument over surpluses and deficits is a muddy one because accounts of how much each candidate will spend depends on estimates and projections.</p>
        <p>The Senate Republican analysis  found, for example, that Mr. Gore's proposals would overshoot the available surplus by as little as $27 billion over 10 years if the costs of Mr. Gore's spending plans are assumed to be at the low end of credible estimates.</p>
        <p>If the costs of the spending plans are assumed to be at the high end of estimates, Mr. Gore's budget would be in the red by as much as $906 billion over 10 years, the report said. For example, the report noted that Mr. Gore says his plan to increase retirement savings would cost $200 billion over 10 years, while other estimates put the cost at as much as $750 billion. The Gore campaign dismissed the report as partisan.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign says that the governor's own plan leaves a $265 billion surplus. But John Cogan, an economics adviser to Mr. Bush, acknowledged today as he briefed reporters on Mr. Gore's spending, that the Bush figures do not account for the costs of deploying a missile defense system, but only for research and development. Mr. Bush has called for a far more robust system than the one that President Clinton had been contemplating at a cost of $60 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cogan argued that Mr. Bush could offset the cost with other military spending savings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also appeared today before the national convention of the American Legion, where he repeated calls for better military preparedness and better health care for veterans. Before he spoke, Alan Lance, the national commander, told the veterans' group that Mr. Gore had declined to appear before it because of a scheduling conflict.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lance said the vice president had offered a substitute, but was turned down because it ''isAl Gore Jr. who is running for president of the United States, not a substitute.''</p>
        <p>To applause, he added, ''I believe you deserve better than that and America deserves better than that.''</p>
