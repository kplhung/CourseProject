        <p>A stalker paid only $45 to an Internet research service to get Amy Boyer's Social Security number. That supposedly private, personal information led her former suitor to the workplace of the 20-year-old New Hampshire woman. He murdered her and killed himself.</p>
        <p>That's the sort of horror story that moves officials to make a pass at action. The Senate Appropriations Committee, at the behest of the New Hampshire Republican Judd Gregg, sent to the floor a bill prohibiting individuals from ''displaying to the public'' anybody's Social Security number without consent.</p>
        <p>His weak bill exempts ''information brokers'' that led the stalker to his prey. But it's a start, and could be toughened by the Democrat Fritz Hollings on the appropriations panel; that South Carolinian has been topping John McCain's privacy protection at the Commerce Committee.</p>
        <p>Over in House Ways and Means, a privacy bill with teeth in it is sponsored by the chairman of the Social Security subcommittee, Florida's Clay Shaw. Not only would it outlaw the sale of the identifying number, but would brand as an ''unfair trade practice'' the withholding of services from a consumer who declines to reveal his Social Security number.</p>
        <p>No longer would a merchant be able to say ''no Social Security number, no credit -- even if you have a good credit card.'' That number of yours has a resale value to other companies eager to target you for dinnertime telemarketing, charitable solicitations or employee monitoring. It is the key to the door of your identity. As in Amy Boyer's case, professional snoops can also offer your unique government identifier to a stalker.</p>
        <p>But even symbolic bills like Gregg's can open the way to stronger protection. A law passed last year, excoriated in this space as ''the Gramm-Summers sellout,'' allowed merged banks and insurance companies to pass around personal data on clients and patients without their consent. The banking lobby's triumph, however, contained one good deed for consumers: It enabled the Federal Trade Commission to curb the easy ''redisclosure'' of nonpublic, personal information by what calls itself ''the lookup industry.''</p>
        <p>The F.T.C. two months ago issued a rule that is enraging credit reporting services, skip-tracing divorce lawyers and some journalists. No longer can ''credit header'' information be bandied about cheaply and quickly. To obtain your name and address, Social Security and telephone number, and mother's maiden name, the buyer of your personal information must now plunk down the money for an entire consumer report.</p>
        <p>That may be meager protection, but it's drawn court challenges from irate snoops. The willingness of the F.T.C. chairman, Robert Pitofsky, to withstand the wrath of the online marketers is a straw of hope in the winds of privacy violation.</p>
        <p>Another straw can be seen in the envelopes you have been getting from the Internal Revenue Service for the past couple of years: the plastic windows showing your address are smaller. Why? It's so that any neighbors and postal workers who may be identity thieves won't be able to see your Social Security number without steaming open the envelope and thereby breaking the law.</p>
        <p>This idea was adopted last week by the Treasury Department, stung by harangues that Secretary Larry Summers' see-through worship of financial transparency was adding to worries about identity theft. ''By removing Social Security numbers from the windows of the mailings of Social Security checks,'' an underling announced proudly, ''we will help safeguard the privacy of millions of Americans.'' That's 14 million fewer times each month that our S.S.N.'s will not be on public display.</p>
        <p>I push this envelope because it  shows that even bureaucrats have begun to feel the groundswell against invasions of privacy.</p>
        <p>So do presidential candidates. George W. Bush was first to specify his support of ''opt-in,'' requiring sellers to seek informed consent of buyers before trading in personal information. And Al Gore, standing beside Amy Boyer's parents, said, ''I will make it a federal crime to buy or sell anyone's Social Security number.''</p>
        <p>There's time before the election to see which man's party is serious about the privacy issue. It goes into the decision mix.</p>
