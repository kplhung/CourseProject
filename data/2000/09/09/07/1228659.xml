        <p>Rejecting an emergency request by the United States Olympic Committee, a Supreme Court justice refused to keep the Greco-Roman wrestler Matt Lindland off the American team soon to leave for Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Justice John Paul Stevens, acting without comment yesterday, left intact court rulings that forced the committee to reinstate Lindland. Committee members sought to keep Keith Sieracki on the team instead.</p>
        <p>Lindland, a former wrestling coach at the University of Nebraska, dropped a 2-1 referee's decision to Sieracki, a military police sergeant, at the Olympic trials in Dallas on June 23. But Lindland contended he was illegally tripped by Sieracki and took the case to arbitration. The arbitrator ordered a rematch, in which Lindland defeated Sieracki, 8-0.</p>
        <p>When the U.S.O.C. balked at making a roster change, Lindland asked a federal trial judge to declare his right to join the United States team.</p>
        <p>United States District Judge James B. Zagel in Chicago ordered the committee to contact the International Olympic Committee and tell it to change the United States roster so Lindland could participate as its 167-pound member.</p>
        <p>A three-judge panel of the Seventh United States Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's order last Friday. (AP)</p>
        <p>SWOOPES INJURED AS U.S. WOMEN WIN: Sheryl Swoopes was helped from the court with a left ankle sprain yesterday with only a minute to play in the United States Olympic women's basketball team's 62-45 victory over Slovakia at Adelaide, Australia, in a tuneup for the Summer Games.</p>
        <p>Swoopes, the Women's National Basketball Association's most valuable player this season, and Teresa Edwards, who sustained a hip pointer in the first half, were listed as day to day. (AP)</p>
        <p>U.S. MEN ROUT JAPAN: The United States men's basketball team overwhelmed Japan, 105-49, in Saitama, Japan, yesterday in the Americans' next-to-last exhibition game before the Olympics. Vince Carter led the United States with 18 points and Vin Baker added 17. (Bloomberg News)</p>
