        <p>The beach chairs are back in the garage, the children have returned to the custody of their teachers, summer's hot breath has taken on the faint scent of autumn and, once again, the publicists are returning to Ontario.</p>
        <p>It can mean only one thing: the summer movie season is finally, blessedly over, and it's time for the Toronto International Film Festival.</p>
        <p>This year marks the 25th annual gathering of filmmakers, actors, agents, producers, publicists and the ladies and gentlemen of the entertainment press, an event that not only has grown into one of the world's most important film markets but also has become the prime launching pad for the fall and holiday season's Oscar bait.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year ''American Beauty'' and ''The Cider House Rules'' were fighting it out for the top Oscars, Kevin Spacey from ''Beauty'' was vying with Denzel Washington from ''The Hurricane'' for best actor, and Hilary Swank of ''Boys Don't Cry'' was carting off practically every acting award in Hollywood, including the Oscar. Every one of those films got its first big exposure at last year's Toronto festival.</p>
        <p>While this year's gathering will include some special events geared to the 25th anniversary -- including the festival's first filmmaker tribute since 1984, honoring the director Stephen Frears -- the festival will largely look as it has in recent years.</p>
        <p>''In a funny way, we didn't want the anniversary to impact on the festival,'' said Piers Handling, director of the festival for the last seven years. ''We wanted some special events, but we didn't want them to take over because, obviously, the festival is on a roll.''</p>
        <p>There were 1,832 films submitted to this year's festival, compared with 1,585 last year. ''And that doesn't include the films we're seeing on screening trips,'' Mr. Handling said. ''In the end, 329 made the cut, including 178 world or North American premieres, from 56 countries, 253 of them feature-length films. Last year, we had 254, so it's basically the same size festival as last year.''</p>
        <p>Tonight's opening gala, which is traditionally reserved for a film from a Canadian director, will be Denys Arcand's ''Stardom,'' about a small-town girl's sudden rise in the modeling world, with an ensemble cast including Dan Aykroyd and Frank Langella. The closing night film, on Sept. 16, will be Michael Kalesniko's ''How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog,'' a comedy with Kenneth Branagh and Robin Wright Penn as a struggling playwright and his baby-obsessed wife.</p>
        <p>There will be plenty in between. The writer and director Cameron Crowe will unveil ''Almost Famous,'' his first film since ''Jerry Maguire'' in 1996, based on his own adventures as a teenage Rolling Stone reporter. Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr. will star in ''Men of Honor,'' a big-studio adventure about the first black Navy Seal. Richard Gere will headline ''Dr. T and the Women,'' from the director Robert Altman.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Glazer, a first-time director, will offer ''Sexy Beast,'' starring Ben Kingsley as a veteran crook. The director Terence Davies has an adaptation of Edith Wharton's ''House of Mirth,'' and the director Ang Lee, returning to China, offers ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' a martial-arts fantasy that was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. Tom Tykwer, the director of the 1998 festival's biggest surprise, ''Run Lola Run,'' returns with ''The Princess and the Warrior,'' about a psychiatric nurse (Franka Potente, star of ''Lola'') whose life is saved by a small-time crook.</p>
        <p>As for performances, the publicists are already fanning the Oscar buzz as vigorously as they can. Among those drawing the most prefestival attention were Joan Allen, playing a United States senator with a sex secret in her past in Rod Lurie's ''The Contender,'' and Willem Dafoe in ''Shadow of the Vampire,'' playing a fictional version of Max Shreck, the actor who starred in F. W. Murnau's classic vampire film, ''Nosferatu.'' And, no doubt, a crop of sleepers will emerge from the public screenings held at packed cinemas all over downtown Toronto.</p>
        <p>''This is my 19th Toronto festival in a row,'' said Amir Malin, chairman of Artisan Entertainment. ''I love Toronto as a town. I love the Toronto audiences, who have a great affinity for films, both ones that are artistically oriented and ones that are more commercially oriented.''</p>
        <p>The Toronto festival has always served at least two functions -- a place where distributors can unveil releases before an appreciative audience (as well as the largest annual concentration of North American entertainment journalists) and a market where producers and directors can try to interest distributors in buying the rights to their films.</p>
        <p>''Toronto has always been the best launching pad for a movie of any festival in the world,'' said Tom Bernard, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, which has seven films in Toronto this year. ''It's like a big press junket that the newspapers have paid for themselves. So we can bring in our talent, screen our movies with very favorable audiences and make the talent available for newspapers all over North America. The Sundance festival is more of an industry audience. The New York festival is much more, well, they're patrons of the arts, not your mainstream filmgoer. But the Toronto audience is real moviegoers. They get every nuance, and they love movies.''</p>
        <p>If the festival has changed in recent years, as many believe, perhaps it has become more important as a launching site and somewhat less important as a film market.</p>
        <p>''It has less to do with the festival than with the ebbs and flows of the movie business,'' Mr. Malin said. ''I can remember going into Toronto and having five or six different films that everyone would be bidding on. Now there is less and less product that is available in a festival context, because there is a tendency when there is a good project around for one of us to pre-buy it.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone agrees. Tom Ortenberg and Mark Urman, co-presidents of Lions Gate Films, said they had continued to have success picking up films in Toronto in recent years (''The Big Kahuna'' last year, ''The Red Violin'' the year before) and hoped to buy more this year.</p>
        <p>''We always go there with an eye toward obtaining important titles for our lineup,'' Mr. Urman said. ''I think there are certainly a number of prospective acquisitions there this year, including many that will be seen for the very first time by anybody.''</p>
        <p>If there has been a shift in the festival, Mr. Ortenberg said, it has been to keep getting bigger -- not just in the number of films, but in their scope and in the swirl of events that surround the screenings.</p>
        <p>''I think it's always represented such an interesting blend of the biggest of Hollywood and the most obscure of international films and everything in between,'' he said. ''Most of the other festivals have an imported audience, but here you have a major metropolis that just gives itself over to the festival in a way that is really unprecedented.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Urman described it this way: ''With the New York Film Festival, if you veer two blocks away from Lincoln Center, you don't even know it's going on. But when you get off the plane in Toronto, you're bombarded. You can't escape it; it's omnipresent.''</p>
