        <p>Cherie Booth, the wife of the British prime minister, strode purposefully into a thicket of criticism last month when she publicly praised Britain's Human Rights Act, a central element of her husband's legislative program and the basis for much of her work as a high-powered international lawyer.</p>
        <p>Yesterday in Manhattan she demonstrated that even the Conservative opposition's provocative efforts to compare her to Hillary Clinton and Lady Macbeth -- in the same breath, and not as a compliment -- had not dissuaded her from pursuing what has become an increasingly outspoken role.</p>
        <p>At a forum sponsored by New York University School of Law, she joined a panel of lawyers from Britain and the United States in discussing the revolution taking place in English courts as the country prepares to incorporate the European convention on human rights into British law, effectively giving ordinary Britons their first domestic bill of rights.</p>
        <p>She was breaking new ground by discussing anything at all. No prime minister's spouse -- including Sir Denis Thatcher, Margaret Thatcher's discreet and sporting husband -- has ever opened his or her mouth in public before in anything but the most innocuous way.</p>
        <p>Norma Major, John Major's wife, was best known for her expertise on the opera. Sir Denis, who tended to walk demurely behind his wife, once observed that ''she runs the country; I run the family.''</p>
        <p>Byron Shafer, the Andrew Mellon professor of American government at Oxford University, said: ''Before Cherie Blair, in some sense the role model for the prime minister's spouse would have been someone like Lady Bird Johnson. They could have public causes -- saving species and beautifying highways -- things that no one could criticize.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Booth, 45, who until recently has deliberately avoided politics and who never speaks to reporters, has taken a leading role in what, for Britain, is a decidedly controversial cause: human rights law in an increasingly Europeanized England.</p>
        <p>''As the world merges together, and at a time when we're at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations, we're seeing the emergence of a body of jurisprudence that is truly international and that provides extraordinary opportunities,'' she said yesterday.</p>
        <p>''We're going to live in a very interesting time in which our judges can take part in the community of nations and rule on the application of international law,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Just how politically fraught such comments can be became clear last month when Ms. Booth and a colleague, Rabinder Singh, wrote an article for The Daily Telegraph saying that the new human rights law, which takes effect on Oct. 2, would ''bring rights home.''</p>
        <p>''The Human Rights Act forms an integral part of the government's program of constitutional reform, which has the aim of modernizing Britain to make it a strong and confident democracy in the 21st century,'' the two wrote.</p>
        <p>But the article provoked an outpouring of sniping from conservative-minded Britons who believe that the new law will produce a deluge of lawsuits and upend many of England's traditions by setting individual rights -- of gays, criminal suspects and the like -- above the rights of the state.</p>
        <p>John Bercow, a home affairs spokesman for the Conservative Party and a man known for his pungent metaphors, was dispatched to lead the party's attack. Accusing Ms. Booth of suffering from ''Hillary syndrome,'' Mr. Bercow said that ''people in Britain will not put up with anyone who thinks she can be an unaccountable cross between first lady and Lady Macbeth.''</p>
        <p>Leaving Lady Macbeth out of it, Ms. Booth has gone further than Mrs. Clinton in pursuing her own career, even as her husband pursues his. Sometimes the two courses seem almost contradictory. As a lawyer specializing in employment law, she is often called on to challenge laws enacted by the government or decisions made by public authorities.</p>
        <p>''In a sense, hers is the more radical departure,'' Mr. Shafer of Oxford said. ''She's said, 'I'm having a life of my own, and it's a public life, and it's going to go on.' ''</p>
        <p>In the end, the attack seemed to backfire, as even some Conservatives bristled at Mr. Bercow's insinuation that perhaps Ms. Booth should not have a job at all. But even so, said Ann McElvoy, a columnist for The Independent in London, Ms. Booth put herself in a newly vulnerable position by inserting herself so publicly into such an explosive issue.</p>
        <p>''Cherie is a very political person,'' Ms. McElvoy said. ''Where there's perhaps a bit of a conflict is that she was very deliberately using Blairite language to describe what the human rights law will achieve. It's very hard, as Hillary Clinton found out, to go back into the shadows once you've come out.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Booth, who temporarily slipped out of the conference yesterday, colleagues said, to breast-feed her three-month-old baby, has proved remarkably unperturbed by the fuss.</p>
        <p>''She is very tough, Cherie,'' said Nick Martin, chief executive of Matrix, the human-rights-minded law firm set up in a blaze of publicity by Ms. Booth and an number of other high-profile lawyers last spring. ''She wants to get on with it and do her job. Her only worry would be that her partners would feel that it distracted from Matrix's work.''</p>
        <p>The Tories also picked on Ms. Booth when it emerged that she had held legal meetings with clients in the Blair family apartment above No. 11 Downing Street.</p>
        <p>''The taxpayer pays for Downing Street as a place to live and work for the prime minister,'' sniffed John Redwood, a top-ranking Conservative. ''A member of the prime minister's family should not be using No. 10 or No. 11 for business purposes. It's as simple as that.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Booth -- who spoke recently during a case involving parental leave about the ''culture of discrimination'' forcing women ''to struggle with the balance of work and family life'' -- was on maternity leave at the time, a Downing Street spokesman said.</p>
        <p>''Downing Street is Mrs. Blair's home,'' the spokesman said. ''As a mother with a small baby, it is not unreasonable for her to work from home.''</p>
