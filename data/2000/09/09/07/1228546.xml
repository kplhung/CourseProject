        <p>Valerie Murphy stood in the alley behind her modest house on the tattered fringe of downtown, smoking nervously, looking away as if to keep tears from coming into her eyes. Even now, four decades later, she said she could hardly speak of the time when her life had been stolen.</p>
        <p>At 53, she is part of what is known here as the ''stolen generation,'' one of perhaps 100,000 Aboriginal children, most of them light skinned, who were taken from their parents between 1910 and 1970 and placed into training homes to be assimilated into the dominant white culture.</p>
        <p>''I don't like thinking about it,'' Murphy said, producing a photograph of herself, uncertainty and fear on her face, with other girls at the Cootamundra Training Home for Girls.</p>
        <p>''I was 5 or 6 when they took me. Eleven years I was there. When you did something wrong, they put you in a room like a box. I would bang and bang to get out of that box. When I was 14, the police flogged me. They have taken my life away.''</p>
        <p>The Summer Olympics, which begin Sept. 15, will showcase Sydney's famous Opera House, its arresting harbor vistas and its fabulous swimmers. The Games will also focus attention on the plight of the Aborigines, Australia's indigenous minority who originally inhabited the continent 50,000 years ago but were marginalized over the past two centuries by European settlers.</p>
        <p>The treatment of the Aboriginals, who make up about 400,000 of Australia's 19 million people, has a bleak resonance with the struggles of American Indians and blacks in the United States. Indigenous people were not allowed to vote until 1962 in Australia and were not counted in the national census until 1967. Life expectancy is 18 years shorter for Aboriginals, average incomes are one-third lower and the unemployment rate -- 34 percent -- is nearly five times the national average.</p>
        <p>Problems with alcohol, drugs, suicide, domestic violence and high birth rates are severe. A quarter of the Aboriginals age 55 or over have never been to school. Aborigines account for half of the young people incarcerated in the juvenile justice system.</p>
        <p>The Australian government will spend $1.5 billion on Aboriginal programs this year, addressing disadvantages in health, education, employment and housing. In May, more than 200,000 people marched through Sydney in support of racial equality. But contentious debate persists on how to achieve reconciliation.</p>
        <p>Only last week, after a number of reprimands, the conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard announced that it would no longer cooperate with the United Nation's attempt to investigate Australia's human rights practices.</p>
        <p>Apparently concerned about the government's vulnerability to demands for compensation, Howard has declined to formally apologize to the Aborigines. He has also opposed a civil rights treaty for Aborigines. Opinion polls indicate that most Australians support Howard in opposition to special treatment for indigenous people.</p>
        <p>''Both the prime minister and I have expressed our personal feelings of deep sorrow in relation to the injustices suffered by indigenous Australians as a result of the practices of past generations,'' said Senator John Herron, the minister for Aboriginal affairs.</p>
        <p>But the government does not support a formal apology, Herron said, because it ''could imply that present generations are in some way responsible and accountable for the actions of earlier generations, actions that were sanctioned by the laws of the time, and that were believed to be in the best interests of the children concerned.''</p>
        <p>Aborigines have sharply criticized Herron for suggesting that perhaps only 10 percent of Aboriginal children were taken from their families and for calling the term ''stolen generation'' rhetorical.</p>
        <p>''They say we were not stolen,'' Murphy said outside her home in the Redfern section of Sydney. ''It made me cry, it hurt so much.''</p>
        <p>She said she was not seeking financial reparation from the government, only an apology for past wrongs.</p>
        <p>''In my heart, it would be helpful,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Australia's most celebrated Aborigine, Cathy Freeman, the world champion in the 400-meter sprint and an Olympic gold medal favorite, called the federal government insensitive in July and revealed that her grandmother had been taken from her parents and did not know her own birthday or her precise age.</p>
        <p>''This is an endemic problem ignored by most Australians, and there seems to be compassion fatigue for acknowledging the problem,'' said Senator Aden Ridgeway, the only Aboriginal member of Parliament.</p>
        <p>The cause of the Aborigines will be made visible during the Olympics in both celebration and protest. Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, plans to mention the Aborigines in his remarks during opening ceremonies. The boomerang, an Aboriginal hunting tool, has been incorporated into the official Olympic logo.</p>
        <p>Organizers will allow the red, black and yellow Aboriginal flag -- depicting the earth, the skin of the indigenous people and the sun -- to be flown at Olympic stadiums. Freeman and others will also be welcomed to carry the flag during victory laps.</p>
        <p>In Victoria Park, just outside Sydney's central business district, televisions will be hooked up so that protesters occupying 40 or so tents at the so-called Aboriginal Tent Embassy can watch Freeman run. A fire ritual is performed each day at the encampment as branches from gum trees are placed on smoking logs in a gesture of peace and healing. Oral histories will be presented at Aboriginal forums in the park during the Games, and a rally is planned for the day the Games open.</p>
        <p>''We want the world to know that this country is at war with its indigenous people,'' said Isabell Coe, the advocate who started the tent embassy in July.</p>
        <p>Another group is planning to form a human chain along the road outside the Sydney airport to make Olympic visitors aware of the despairing condition of Australia's indigenous people. Trevor Close, an Aboriginal activist, said he planned to camp with some protesters near the Olympic Stadium and might resort to violent clashes if the police interfere.</p>
        <p>The Aborigines were nomadic hunter-gatherers still using stone tools when European settlers, primarily British convicts, arrived in 1788. Their encounter with white migration proved ruinous to the Aborigines' way of life. Many were massacred, others died of diseases to which they were not immune and survivors were placed in missions run by churches and the government.</p>
        <p>''We are being treated like aliens in our own country,'' Coe said. ''The only place we are winning is the number of prisoners.''</p>
        <p>Still, Aboriginals have managed to produce notable achievements in recent years on the national and world stage. Nova Perris-Kneebone became the first Aborigine to win a gold medal as part of Australia's field hockey team at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Freeman is a two-time world champion and Olympic silver medalist in the 400 meters. The Aborginal writer Kim Scott won a share of Australia's top fiction prize this year.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, two members of the so-called stolen generation had their claims for reparation dismissed last month in a federal test case.</p>
        <p>The urban despair of Sydney's Aborigines is apparent in Murphy's blighted neighborhood, known as ''the block,'' a failed land-grant experiment for indigenous people. It is a rat- and drug-infested collection of graffiti-scarred houses where heroin addicts inject themselves 50 yards from a playground where children frolick on swings.</p>
        <p>Ridgeway, the Aboriginal senator, said the sense of fatalism can be overcome only by self-determination, including the recognition of traditional laws, diversionary programs instead of mandatory prison sentencing and restoring the role of Aboriginal elders within communities. But the current government is concerned that the creation of two sets of laws would diminish the sense of Australia as a single nation.</p>
        <p>''If you are talking about a disciplinary code that is breached and the penalty enacted might be a spear in the thigh, by today's values that would be something broadly unacceptable,'' said Philip Ruddock, the minister of immigration and multicultural affairs.</p>
        <p>The infant mortality rate among Aboriginals, once 20 times the national average, has decreased to three times the national average. While only a handful of Aborigines once went to college, there are now 8,000 college graduates, ministry statistics show.</p>
        <p>But a much more comprehensive effort needs to be taken, Ridgeway contended, or the cycle of poverty and despair will only perpetuate itself under the current welfare state.</p>
        <p>''The most a young Aboriginal person can expect to achieve is to work for the dole scheme, and he essentially reaches that at 16, 17 or 18,'' Ridgeway said. ''There is nothing beyond that. Incarceration becomes a badge of honor, a right of passage into adulthood.''</p>
