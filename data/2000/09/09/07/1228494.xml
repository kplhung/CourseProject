        <p>WHO knew that so many grandfathers went by the name Poppop?</p>
        <p>Robert Sullivan found out. A grandfather of eight who lives in Summerville, S.C., Mr. Sullivan uses the name Poppop@aol.com as his e-mail address. He gets about five e-mail messages a day for the wrong Poppop.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan suspects that many of the missives are meant for variations of Poppop -- Poppops burdened with additional numbers or initials -- owned by people who were too late to claim the pure, unadulterated version that he grabbed in 1992.</p>
        <p>A good screen name is hard to find, and getting harder. AOL has 23 million members and allows seven names for each account. So theoretically, 161 million names have already been taken.</p>
        <p>People looking for new names are frustrated. Some switch e-mail services, try other spellings, add numbers or finally just settle on a less appealing name.</p>
        <p>''I must have tried a million combinations of my name,'' said John Noh, who works in public relations in Silicon Valley. ''You wouldn't believe how many JNohs or JohnNs or JohnNohs there are in the AOL database.</p>
        <p>''Each abbreviation I tried had to be accompanied by some number,'' said Mr. Noh, who used to think that his Korean last name was not very common. ''I got so fed up I said, 'I'll put my own number in there.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Noh claimed noh666@aol.com.</p>
        <p>''I had such a devilish time trying to get a screen name,'' he said, ''maybe I chose it subconsciously.''</p>
        <p>But the screen name became a problem when he began looking for a job.</p>
        <p>''I felt stupid sending it out,'' Mr. Noh said. ''It was a conversation piece among my friends, but in a professional setting I realized how inappropriate it was.'' He was relieved to get jnoh@excite.com.</p>
        <p>Screen names are now an important part of people's identities, said Dr. Steve Jones, a communication professor at the University of Illinois in Chicago who studies online social relations. People's screen names are often meaningful to them, even if they are inscrutable to others.</p>
        <p>When someone asks for a screen name that is already taken, e-mail services often suggest adding a number. That can be a problem. Even numbers that mean something to the user -- a street address, a ZIP code, a birth date, a lucky number -- seem random and hard for others to remember. That is why people prefer sequences, like 1234, or patterns, like 8888, Dr. Jones said.</p>
        <p>The earliest AOL users were able to get ordinary screen names. ''Having anything normal-sounding on AOL is a gold star of the early adoptive personality,'' said Rachel Pine a former AOL user in New York.</p>
        <p>Last fall, Ms. Pine planned a party that was supposed to have Curious George as the host. She wanted to register ''CuriousGeorge'' as a screen name where people could send R.S.V.P.'s. She tried CuriousGeorge@yahoo, then CGeorge, CuriousG, CuryosGeorge and even YellowHat -- a ''desperation move,'' she said. All were taken. So she went elsewhere and found CuriousGeorge@looksmart.com.</p>
        <p>As for her own name, both RachelPine@yahoo.com and RachelPine@aol.com were taken. But she got Rachel</p>
