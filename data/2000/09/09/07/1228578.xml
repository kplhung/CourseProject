        <p>Ruling that the online music start-up company MP3.com had willfully infringed the copyrights of the Universal Music Group, a federal judge yesterday ordered the company to pay potentially crippling damages in one of the first cases to test the legal boundaries of digital music distribution.</p>
        <p>Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan said MP3.com must pay $25,000 for each of the Universal compact discs included in its My.MP3.com service, which lets users listen to music from any computer connected to the Internet after indicating that they possess the CD or have purchased it through an online vendor associated with the company.</p>

        <p>Ruling that the online music start-up company MP3.com had willfully infringed the copyrights of the Universal Music Group, a federal judge yesterday ordered the company to pay potentially crippling damages in one of the first cases to test the legal boundaries of digital music distribution.</p>
        <p>Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan said MP3.com must pay $25,000 for each of the Universal compact discs included in its My.MP3.com service, which lets users listen to music from any computer connected to the Internet after indicating that they possess the CD or have purchased it through an online vendor associated with the company.</p>
        <p>The number was less than the $45,000 a CD that Universal's lawyers had requested, but an MP3.com lawyer had argued that any penalty more than $500 a CD would be a virtual ''death sentence'' for the company.</p>
        <p>The number of CD's copied is in dispute. But depending on how many copyrights MP3.com is found to have infringed, total damages could reach as high as $250 million.</p>
        <p>''If they have to pay numbers near that it would be devastating,'' said Heath Terry, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''But now we go into more negotiations and an appeal. Basically it stretches out the timeline on all of this, so instead of being able to come to a resolution they're plunged into more litigation.''</p>
        <p>Another phase of the trial in November will determine the number of CD's involved. Universal has said 5,000 to 10,000 copyrights are at issue. MP3.com's lawyers have set the number at 4,740, but said they planned to challenge the eligibility of virtually all of Universal's copyright registrations.</p>
        <p>With about $300 million in cash, some of which has been earmarked to settle with the four other major record companies originally involved in the lawsuit, analysts said MP3.com should be able to stay afloat if it managed to keep the damages payment in the $100 million range. The other companies -- Sony Music, Time Warner, the EMI Group and Bertelsmann A.G. -- did not disclose the settlement amounts, but  analysts estimated that MP3.com settled for $20 million with each company. A group of music publishers has also filed suit against the company.</p>
        <p>The trial has been closely watched by many companies seeking to stake a claim in the potentially lucrative arena of Internet music distribution, including Napster, the online music trading service that is facing its own lawsuit by the major record labels.  In July, a federal judge ordered Napster to stop helping computer users trade copyrighted music over the Internet. The ruling was later stayed pending appeal.</p>
        <p>In determining the level of damages, Judge Rakoff said he chose a number considerably lower than the maximum penalty of $150,000 an infringement because Universal had not specified how it lost money because of MP3.com's actions, even though it could have done so. He also said MP3.com had acted more responsibly than other Net start-ups.</p>
        <p>But the judge said he balanced that against the need to deter other Internet companies from copyright infringement.</p>
        <p>''Some companies operating in the area of the Internet may have a misconception that because their technology is somewhat novel, they are somehow immune from the ordinary applications of laws of the United States, including copyright law,'' Judge Rakoff said. ''They need to understand that the law's domain knows no such limits.''</p>
        <p>Shares of MP3.com fell in after-hours trading. They last traded at $5.88 on the Instinet electronic trading system, down $2 from where they last traded before being halted, pending the ruling announcement, at about 2 p.m. on the Nasdaq stock market.</p>
        <p>Michael Robertson, MP3.com's chief executive, said the company would appeal.</p>
        <p>''We built technology that lets people listen to their own CD collections,'' Mr. Robertson told reporters in Judge Rakoff's courtroom yesterday afternoon. ''We think the law needs to accommodate consumers' need to listen to their own CD collections online in a digital form.''</p>
        <p>The law currently allows consumers to store their music on-line and listen to it anywhere after those individuals copy their own CD's in a somewhat onerous process known as ripping, and upload them to a virtual storage locker provided by companies like Myplay, an MP3.com rival.</p>
        <p>To make its My.MP3.com service easier to use, MP3.com did not require users to load their own music into an online locker. Rather, a user had merely to insert a CD into the CD-ROM drive of a computer and log into MP3.com's Web site, at which point MP3.com would automatically put a copy of the music into the person's virtual locker. A user could also buy a CD from an online retailer and listen to it immediately once MP3.com had confirmed the transaction.</p>
        <p>The company suspended the service after Judge Rakoff ruled in April that the company had violated the copyrights of the major record labels by compiling a database of some 80,000 CD's.</p>
        <p>MP3.com hoped to attract advertisers with the service and eventually charge a subscription fee. The company argued that the service was legal under the fair-use doctrine of copyright law.</p>
        <p>After MP3.com settled with the other four companies, Universal, a unit of the Seagram Company and the largest of the five major companies, remained as a plaintiff.</p>
        <p>A Universal spokesman said yesterday that the company would have no comment because of the pending litigation.</p>
        <p>Cary Sherman, general counsel of the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group representing the major labels, said in a statement that the group was pleased with the ruling. ''This should send a message that there are consequences when a business recklessly disregards the copyright law,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In an appeal, MP3.com will no doubt have to address Judge Rakoff's initial determination that its fair-use defense was, as he reiterated yesterday, ''without any merit.'' In his ruling on willfulness, the judge said that the notion that My.MP3.com simply enabled consumers to more easily store their own CD's was ''little more than a sham'' because the consumers' CD's were never actually stored with MP3.com.</p>
        <p>''While they camouflaged the critical differences with broad-brush appeals to 'consumer rights,' they were in fact never in any doubt that this purported justification for their otherwise obvious copyright infringement rested on a doubtful factual premise,'' the judge said.</p>
