        <p>RSA Security said it had placed the RSA public key encryption algorithm into the public domain, permitting programmers to freely incorporate the technology into their products. The RSA algorithm -- named after three computer scientists: Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adelman -- has been widely used for more than a decade to protect the privacy of digital commerce and communications. The technology was originally awarded a United States patent on Sept. 20, 1983, and the patent is due to expire this month. Known as public key cryptography, the technology, also pioneered independently by researchers at Stanford University, makes it possible for two people who have never met to exchange information securely.</p>
