        <p>Andre Agassi, the defending Olympic gold medalist in men's singles, announced yesterday that he was withdrawing from the Sydney Olympics,  and made it clear that he was doing so because both his sister, Tammee, and his mother, Elizabeth, have breast cancer.</p>
        <p>Agassi's decision was not a surprise. The news of his mother's and sister's condition emerged during the United States Open, in which Agassi was defeated in the second round and acknowledged that he was struggling with his concentration.</p>
        <p>''For personal reasons, as a consequence of a family medical situation, I will not be able to participate in the upcoming Sydney Olympics,'' Agassi said in a statement. ''My time and attention should be with my family during this period. I wish all of the U.S. athletes great success and know that you will return more enriched by your experience.''</p>
