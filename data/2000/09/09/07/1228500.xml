        <p>I JUST hope I don't pick up a fake English accent,'' Candace Bushnell said, reaching for a glass of Champagne. It was proffered by a dapper butler on hand one evening to serve her and some 25 British and American guests cocktails and blinis laden with caviar.</p>
        <p>The setting was Cranley Lodge, the London pied-a-terre of her English boyfriend, Stephen Morris, where Ms. Bushnell now makes herself at home.</p>
        <p>Like the main character in ''Single Process,'' a novella in her new book, ''Four Blondes'' (Atlantic Monthly Press), Ms. Bushnell appears to have found love at last with a suave gent after years of exasperation with the dating game in New York. Since the couple began cavorting romantically 15 months ago, Ms. Bushnell has been sharing his home in London. Mr. Morris, a venture capitalist with a taste for the high life, spends three months a year in England.</p>
        <p>''London's like New York -- there's a lot of funny, fun girls here,'' Ms. Bushnell said. One of them is Imogen Edwards-Jones, a columnist for The Times of London. With a flourish, Ms. Edwards-Jones entered Cranley Lodge clutching a copy of her own new book, ''My Canape Hell.'' (''It's about a girl on a downward spiral in celebrity hell London,'' she said.) The two women embraced with theatrical effusiveness.</p>
        <p>For all the withering precision with which she chronicles the glittering lives of semicelebrities, social aspirants and moneyed folk, Ms. Bushnell, 41, appears to relish being part of the world she makes seem so harrowing.</p>
        <p>Cranley Lodge, despite the grand name, is a tiny two-bedroom house built in 1860 as a painting studio for an earl's wife. Essentially a country cottage in Chelsea, in the middle of London, the house is concealed behind a high brick wall that barely diminishes the roar of passing double-decker buses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morris appeared at the party in a conservative blue suit and tie that looked incongruous in the silvery stage set  designed for him by Nicholas Haslam, the society decorator. ''I told Nicky I wanted it to be like a Roman villa, then I pretty much left it to him,'' Mr. Morris said. Mr. Haslam gave him trompe l'oeil stone walls, plump sofas and shimmering curtains. ''It's the stuff photographers' umbrellas are made out of,'' Mr. Haslam said. ''It keeps in the heat in winter, and it's terribly chic.''</p>
        <p>During the party -- where the eccentric assortment of guests included Paul McKenna, a celebrity hypnotist; a bevy of rail-thin blondes; and raffish bankers chuckling about plans to hit a lap-dance joint later -- Mr. Haslam carried on decorating. With casual aplomb, he whipped a small tube of gold paint out of his pocket and proceeded to daub a scuffed fluted column.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Haslam sought her opinion, Ms. Bushnell had limited input. She doesn't do decor (even though her parents took her antiquing almost every Sunday of her childhood, she said) but she makes an effort to be spectacularly decorative. Ms. Bushnell greeted the guests in a mohair micro-miniskirt with sequins, and glittery knee-high boots by Jimmy Choo, enthusiastically inhaling Marlboro Lights and shaking a professionally coiffed golden mane.</p>
        <p>Fittingly for a chronicler of sexual mores in ''Four Blondes'' and her first book, ''Sex and the City,'' she invariably writes next to the bed. ''So the only thing I asked for was a little tiny desk in the bedroom, because that's where I work,'' she said.</p>
        <p>After years of struggling as a freelance writer for women's magazines -- her career began improbably at Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping -- she gained recognition five years ago as the sex columnist for The New York Observer; lucrative book, television and film contracts followed.</p>
        <p>She now flies business class and relishes shopping sprees (but not in London -- ''You find yourself buying a little pair of sweat pants, and it's like $200,'' she said). And she gives imaginative gifts. For Christmas, she commissioned a painting from Lady Theresa Chipman -- a painter who is the sister of the Duke of Rutland, as well as the former lead singer in a rock band. Lady Theresa is also an ex-New York nightclubbing pal of Ms. Bushnell. The subject of the painting? Mr. Morris. And the painting is proudly displayed in the Chelsea living room.</p>
        <p>She seems tickled that her travels in the fast lane in New York and London, including her nighttime peregrinations and even her sex life, have become the subject of gossip columns on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>''Being an author is really the lowest level of celebrity,'' she said. Maybe so, but she has raised it to a high art with a series of titillating publicity pictures that feature her seemingly infinite legs and generous portions of honey-toned flesh. Currently, she is working on a movie script for Universal Studios based on ''Platinum,'' the third novella in ''Four Blondes,'' about an insecure American girl married to a European prince whose life -- and Cinderella fantasy -- starts to fall apart when she becomes convinced that her husband is cheating on her.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bushnell says that Universal executives have been urging her to make some characters seem more mature, sincere and to have them exude noble intent. ''I was trying to do it, but I got stuck,'' Ms. Bushnell admitted. ''Then I realized, I don't do noble. I do shallow and superficial.''</p>
        <p>If so, she may find material lacking in London, which she distinguishes from New York as a place where one might actually be happily married and not have to be constantly in search of excitement.</p>
        <p>''It's just not a big deal, being married here,'' Ms. Bushnell marveled. ''It's not this horrifying thing that it is for men in New York. Here, they don't have the attitude of the old ball and chain. If you're married, it doesn't mean you're home every night with your spouse. There's less of that 'Oh my God he's out, what is he doing?' syndrome.''</p>
        <p>And dinner parties at home in London are the preferred form of socializing. ''It's not like New York, where you feel like going out is your second job,'' she said. ''Here, it feels like people go out not necessarily to have their photograph taken, but to see their friends.''</p>
        <p>Not that she has given up on New York. Three of the four stories in her new book are set in Manhattan. And she divides her time between New York, London and a rented house in Kent, Conn. In Manhattan, she and a girlfriend, Anne Fell, share an Upper East Side apartment just a few blocks north of the town house Mr. Morris, 35, uses when he is in town. She shares the Connecticut house with Sara Colleton, a film producer who also lives in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''Emotionally, I think it's healthier to live with other people,'' Ms. Bushnell said. ''If I am working alone in the country, I feel like I'm going crazy after a few days.'' Since Mr. Morris's business activities frequently take him to Australia and all over Europe, Ms. Bushnell explained, the couple try to schedule weekends together in Connecticut or flying visits to London.</p>
        <p>''English guys are fun,'' Ms. Bushnell said. ''They're more relaxed and less afraid of being themselves and being vulnerable. Most of the English men I know are willing to poke fun at themselves. It's less of a macho culture. You don't meet guys here who go to the gym every day. Men here just don't care.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, she noted: ''In England, character counts for a lot. You don't have to look like a model to get a guy.'' (Looking like one herself, she would have to admit that it certainly helps.) ''It's all about being entertaining and being a good egg,'' she said. ''Englishmen are entertaining -- they're characters. They can be flawed and make mistakes and it's O.K.''</p>
        <p>Does she include her new boyfriend in that description? ''I don't feel that comfortable talking about it much,'' she said. ''He is terrific. I would say he would fit that model.''</p>
        <p>Englishmen are no more likely to discuss their feelings than the American variety, she said. ''But unlike New York, this is not a psychoanalyzed culture,'' she said. ''That idea of English restraint, which sounds horrifying to Americans, is actually a good thing, like this culture of manners and being polite. The truth is that manners and politeness can get you through the rough patches of a relationship. If you act like nothing happened, sometimes it's better.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bushnell's appreciation for restraint -- at least in men -- seems to have been instilled when she was growing up in Glastonbury, Conn. ''I'm from New England,'' she said. ''We're kind of cold.''</p>
        <p>For the last three years, she and Ms. Colleton have been renting a small, slightly ramshackle, red-painted clapboard Connecticut house that sits on nine acres, with a sizable pond.</p>
        <p>''Stephen kindly calls this a cottage,'' she said during a visit in August to her country place.</p>
        <p>''Nonsense,'' Mr. Morris countered, grinning. ''It's a shack in the woods.'' Well, hardly. But its cozy slip-covered sofas and threadbare Yankee chic are a far cry from the bijou glitz of his designer beige-and-gray bachelor pad in London. For the Connecticut house, Ms. Bushnell picked the vintage fabric for the living room curtains at a local antiques store with the risible name R. T. Facts, then just threw the fabric over the curtain rods. ''Yeah, I say, I'm going to sew them some day, but I really don't sew,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The books in the living room came with the house, but she has found places for the antique boxes and lamps her mother has given her over the years.</p>
        <p>On a sunny Sunday afternoon, Ms. Bushnell wandered around in a bathing suit and red-and-white striped men's shirt, leading this reporter on a tour. ''Henry Kissinger lives up here, and we share the same plumber,'' she said. ''But that's as close as I've got to him.''</p>
        <p>As she passed through the chaotic kitchen, the casually dressed Mr. Morris gave her a fulsome wink and offered her a beer glass full of Champagne. ''I always drink Champagne on Saturdays and Sundays,'' Ms. Bushnell said, as if imparting the secret of the miracle diet that keeps her slender and cheerful.</p>
        <p>On reaching the abandoned vegetable patch, which has weeds taller than her 5-foot-6-inch frame, Ms. Bushnell issued a confession. ''I'm not much of a gardener and I can't decorate,'' she said, sounding apologetic. ''I'm so bad at it. I'm just so lucky that Sara is my roommate, because she's great at all that stuff. I'm the kind of person who after 15 minutes in a place doesn't notice the furniture. I don't really notice my environment.''</p>
        <p>For all the time she spends in the country, Ms. Bushnell seems quintessentially urban, making no claims to being domesticated. Asked why he fell for Ms. Bushnell, Mr. Morris laughed. ''It's not her chicken wings, I'll tell you that,'' he said.</p>
