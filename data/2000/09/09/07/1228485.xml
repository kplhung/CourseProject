        <p>Newtithing, a San Francisco organization created a decade ago to encourage people with assets to give more, developed the tool, called NewTitheCalc. It has a five-step process to show people how by analyzing income, expenses and assets they can compare their current giving practices with the NewTithing strategy.</p>
        <p>Financial advisers and tax planners discourage giving by focusing on minimizing how much income is realized so that taxes are held down, said Claude Rosenberg, a retired San Francisco investment manager who founded NewTithing in 1990. He said people with financial assets, even modest ones, have much more capacity to give than they realize.</p>
        <p>The calculator will be unveiled today at Sharing the Wealth, a philanthropy conference in Minneapolis. It will be available initially at two sites. One, maintained by Minnesota Public Radio, is access.mpr.org/civic</p>
