      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The cock-of-the-walk score for ''The Bulls' Night Out,'' performed by the Swing Daddies, gives the film a focus and energy that its filmmaking lacks. (The music sounds like a bouncing-on-the-balls-of-its-feet Las Vegas fanfare for a Sinatra entrance at the old Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas.) The picture's title is explained in the very first scene, when a barkeep, George (Jack Marnell), tells a customer why the Bulls' Night Out banner hangs in Ruby's Bar, his establishment. ''Off-duty retired cops show ID, drink for free -- they do it once a month,'' George explains. Satisfied, the customer downs a vodka, drops off the mail and heads off into the streets.</p>
        <p>''Bulls' Night Out'' is an occasion for three of George's retired friends -- Louie (Steve Kasprzak), Zap (J. J. Flash) and J. J. (A. J. Johnson) -- to drop by and play a few games of poker while tossing back free drinks. The film's writer and director, Lindley Farley, set his story in 1993 and cast actors who look like retired cops. They have heavy arms, thickening middles and faces that have moved beyond exhausted to hardened; they look like aging rhinos determined to show they're still entitled to keep their chests up and do some good.</p>

        <p>The cock-of-the-walk score for ''The Bulls' Night Out,'' performed by the Swing Daddies, gives the film a focus and energy that its filmmaking lacks. (The music sounds like a bouncing-on-the-balls-of-its-feet Las Vegas fanfare for a Sinatra entrance at the old Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas.) The picture's title is explained in the very first scene, when a barkeep, George (Jack Marnell), tells a customer why the Bulls' Night Out banner hangs in Ruby's Bar, his establishment. ''Off-duty retired cops show ID, drink for free -- they do it once a month,'' George explains. Satisfied, the customer downs a vodka, drops off the mail and heads off into the streets.</p>
        <p>''Bulls' Night Out'' is an occasion for three of George's retired friends -- Louie (Steve Kasprzak), Zap (J. J. Flash) and J. J. (A. J. Johnson) -- to drop by and play a few games of poker while tossing back free drinks. The film's writer and director, Lindley Farley, set his story in 1993 and cast actors who look like retired cops. They have heavy arms, thickening middles and faces that have moved beyond exhausted to hardened; they look like aging rhinos determined to show they're still entitled to keep their chests up and do some good.</p>
        <p>George keeps a log of the license plates of criminals who drive around the neighborhood, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The quick-to-anger Zap wears a Hawaiian shirt that was probably his idea of undercover back when he was, as they say on ''NYPD Blue'' (and in ''Bulls''), on the job. Louie drinks himself into an early morning haze. J. J. has mellowed into a nine-year-old depression after the murder of his wife and children.</p>
        <p>These actors tear into the material, rolling through the movie with the pride of guys who've known exactly what they wanted to do for their entire lives. When they inflict a little barroom justice on a would-be robber, tricking him into revealing which hand he favors so they can inflict a lesson upon it, you're watching actors with years of confidence in their craft. In story terms, ''Bulls'' resembles one of the 1970's born-to-be-paperback police novels written by Dorothy Uhnak or Robert Daley. George and his pals take so much pride in their return to action that they begin stalking the neighborhood drug dealers, and their vigilante actions go tragically wrong.</p>
        <p>''Bulls'' almost looks like a movie an ex-cop would make; the bar interior, where most of the action takes place, looks like it's lighted with the high beams of a police cruiser. Mr. Farley's directing is crude, at best, with surveillance camera technique and cuts that seem to have been made with a blowtorch. He also crams in several space-wasting subplots, including a romance between George's daughter, Ruby (Jayne  A. Larson), and a long-haired stereotypical bleeding heart who looks like a perp. And there's too much of a  baker (Steve Roberts), stuck in for comic relief, whose accent and patent leather mustache seem to have come from a correspondence course.</p>
        <p>But then there are the four actors playing the rusting, impatient former cops -- especially the easygoing but brusque Mr. Marnell (George Wall) and Mr. Johnson, whose low-boil bitterness is so well thought out that even the speech he gives explaining himself doesn't undermine it. (He's the weary voice of reason reacting to Zap's racism.)</p>
        <p>The movie doesn't turn out to be as benignly right-wing as it initially suggests, though the plot turns can  be spotted a mile away. As could the torch Bill that (Russ Romano), George's other bartender, has been carrying for Ruby for years, something that should be obvious to everyone and goes unnoticed. Maybe George and his crew weren't such good cops after all; their observational skills are questionable.</p>
