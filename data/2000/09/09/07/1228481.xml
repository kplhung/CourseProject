        <p>The Way of the Bunchberry</p>
        <p>Q. I have tried many times to transplant bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), to no avail. Now I have found some plants with red berries. Will they contain seeds I can plant? Is this the right time to pick them, and what are my chances of success?</p>
        <p>A. Collecting wildflower seed is much less destructive of native stands than the gathering of plants, and in the case of bunchberries it's also more likely to lead to success, said Cheryl Lowe, horticultural director of the New England Wild Flower Society, in Framingham, Mass. The society has had a lot of experience with these lovely little plants, which, at about six inches tall, are the shortest native dogwoods. Ms. Lowe recommends the following method of propagation.</p>

        <p>The Way of the Bunchberry</p>
        <p>Q. I have tried many times to transplant bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), to no avail. Now I have found some plants with red berries. Will they contain seeds I can plant? Is this the right time to pick them, and what are my chances of success?</p>
        <p>A. Collecting wildflower seed is much less destructive of native stands than the gathering of plants, and in the case of bunchberries it's also more likely to lead to success, said Cheryl Lowe, horticultural director of the New England Wild Flower Society, in Framingham, Mass. The society has had a lot of experience with these lovely little plants, which, at about six inches tall, are the shortest native dogwoods. Ms. Lowe recommends the following method of propagation.</p>
        <p>This fall, gather the berries as soon as they are soft and part readily from the plant. Crush them lightly. Then cover with cool water and soak them for a week or so to loosen the clinging pulp. Strain, and then work the mush between your fingers to free the seeds. Rinse them.</p>
        <p>Fill a planting flat with sterile potting mixture and plant the seeds  1/2 to  3/4 inch deep, 2 inches apart in all directions. Water thoroughly from the bottom. Choose a partly shaded spot outdoors and sink the flat so the top is level with the soil surface. Cover with a porous plant cover like Reemay, to keep animals out and prevent splashing. Leave for the winter.</p>
        <p>Start checking for seedlings in early spring and remove the cover when they appear. When they have four leaves, transplant to a flat filled with potting soil that has been mixed with a small amount of aged bark. Sink the new flat as you did the old one. Keep the little plants moist but not wet.</p>
        <p>Leave them in the nursery flat for another year; then transplant to their final location, which should be partly shaded, cool and damp. Remember that bunchberries thrive in Greenland and will do best where chilly.</p>
        <p>''The farther north you go, the better they do,'' Ms. Lowe said. ''They really don't like hot, humid summers. Our best spot here is a north facing slope where a seeping spring keeps the ground cool all summer.''</p>
        <p>The New England Wild Flower Society sells bunchberry seeds; it is at 180 Hemenway Road, Framingham, Mass. 01701; (508) 877-7630. Plants are available from Fieldstone Gardens, 620 Quaker Lane, Vassalboro, Me. 04989 (207) 923-3836; both catalogs are $2.50.</p>
        <p>Tomatoes Need Another Home</p>
        <p>Q. I have been planting tomatoes for seven years. Every year, they grow well and yield a nice output of fruit. Then, around Aug. 1, the leaves turn yellow, starting at the bottom and moving up the plants, which die in a few weeks. I have been told that the cause is the acidity of the soil. I have applied lime in substantial quantities, but this year the same thing happened.</p>
        <p>A. Northeastern soils are usually on the acid side, and adding lime to prevent them from becoming too acidic is an old farming tradition. But adding large amounts of lime -- or any other mineral -- without knowing whether you really need it can do more harm than good. It's always best to get a soil analysis before taking action.</p>
        <p>Soil analysis can be done by the nearest agricultural extension service, which may be listed in the phone book under Extension or Cooperative Extension, under the name of the state university or with county offices. The extension office will explain how to gather and send the sample. In most states, you can also send a dead leaf or two and get an expert autopsy.</p>
        <p>While waiting for the results, think about planting next year's tomatoes somewhere tomatoes have never grown. It's likely the service will tell you that your problem is not acidity but rather a fungus disease like early blight (alternaria) or fusarium wilt. These diseases are widespread and once they get into the soil they stay there for years.</p>
