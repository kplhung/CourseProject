        <p>Tired of wearing those unwieldy eyeglasses? Sick of messing with contact lenses? Try getting a job with the city of Hartford, and your troubles could soon be over.</p>
        <p>Hartford, it turns out, is the only large city in Connecticut, and possibly in the New York metropolitan region, that offers its employees full coverage for cosmetic laser eye surgery, a perk that could end up costing the struggling city millions.</p>
        <p>No one knows exactly how many of the 7,000 current and retired city employees have taken advantage of the hugely popular corrective eye surgery, which costs a minimum of $3,600 for both eyes. But union officials estimated several hundred union members employed by the city have undergone the procedure.</p>
        <p>Some city officials had been unaware of the contract clause stipulating the benefit until a local ophthalmologist started running newspaper ads telling of it last week. Now the officials are admitting they are concerned about its potential cost.</p>
        <p>''We need to get a handle on it, see what the costs are,'' said Saundra Kee Borges, Hartford's city manager, who has had the laser eye surgery.</p>
        <p>Since 1995, when the federal government approved laser eye surgery for correcting nearsightedness, the process has become a routine out patient procedure, but only for those who can afford to pay several thousand dollars for it. Because the procedure is regarded as primarily cosmetic, most insurance plans do not cover it.</p>
        <p>Gene Surrett, the city's health benefits manager, said the eye surgery benefit had been part of the city's health plan since at least 1991, but was not widely used until recently. ''We're kind of saddled with it at this point,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Edwin Vargas, president of the Hartford Federation of Teachers, the largest union in the city, estimated that about 400 city employees have taken advantage of the benefit so far. ''It's been pretty widely known around here,'' he said. ''People who were happy with the surgery, they go back to the school and say, 'I can see perfectly.' ''</p>
        <p>Though other cities in the New York metropolitan region may offer health plans that offer discounts or low-cost laser eye surgery, none do it at their own expense.</p>
        <p>In Bridgeport, Conn., city employees can choose a vision plan that pays up to $1,800 per eye for the surgery, said Monti Miles, the city's employee services coordinator. In Newark, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, the city's largest health care provider, offers a 25 percent discount on the procedure if it is performed by a specific clinic.</p>
        <p>New York City soon may also offer its employees a health plan that gives discounts for the surgery, said Dorothy Wolfe, director of the city's employee benefits program.</p>
        <p>What prompted Hartford, with a 27 percent poverty rate, to give its employees an expensive, mostly cosmetic health benefit? A bit of municipal history is required to explain.</p>
        <p>In the late 1980's, the city's labor contracts included a clause requiring the city to cover the cost of radial keratotomy, a method used at the time to treat vision-related conditions. In 1991, when the city switched from being self-insured to contracting with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield to provide a customized set of major medical benefits, the rarely used keratotomy benefit was included, Mr. Surrett said. But as recent technological advances made laser eye surgery faster, safer and cheaper, city employees started using the keratotomy clause to make the city pay for the procedures.</p>
        <p>''Who was to know it was going to develop into this today?'' Mr. Surrett said. He said he would not ask the unions to reconsider the perquisite. ''That would open a whole can of worms,'' he said. ''Negotiations would never end.''</p>
        <p>The benefit had not attracted much attention until earlier this year, when Dr. Richard Fichman, an ophthalmologist in nearby Manchester, began hiring people to troll the hallways of Hartford schools to hand out fliers telling how city employees could undergo his clinic's laser procedure at almost no expense to them, Ms. Kee Borges said.</p>
        <p>In July, Dr. Fichman's representatives were caught handing out pamphlets at City Hall. ''We told them to get out,'' Ms. Kee Borges said.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Surrett placed a call to Anthem Blue Cross, asking exactly how many city employees have elected to have the surgery so far. If one-quarter of the city's 7,000 active and retired employees have the procedure, at $4,000 for both eyes, the cost to the city would be $7 million.</p>
        <p>Of course, the procedure does not appeal to everyone. ''Some people freaked out when they saw that the contract they had to sign said there's a possibility they could go blind,'' Mr. Vargas said.</p>
