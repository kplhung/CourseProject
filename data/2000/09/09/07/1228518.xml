        <p>Re ''Life Change for A.C.L.U. Chief. Not That Words Fail Him'' (Public Lives column, Sept. 2):</p>
        <p>Ira Glasser merits great praise for his highly effective stewardship of the American Civil Liberties Union. But surely you exaggerate when you describe the union, pre-Ira, as ''a chaotic group of young lawyers in threadbare offices with pizza crusts lurking under broken chairs.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Life Change for A.C.L.U. Chief. Not That Words Fail Him'' (Public Lives column, Sept. 2):</p>
        <p>Ira Glasser merits great praise for his highly effective stewardship of the American Civil Liberties Union. But surely you exaggerate when you describe the union, pre-Ira, as ''a chaotic group of young lawyers in threadbare offices with pizza crusts lurking under broken chairs.''</p>
        <p>During the 1970's, I was regularly on the premises of the A.C.L.U. (and had office space there from 1972 to 1973), helping to start the union's Women's Rights Project and serving as one of its general counsel. The union in those days was ably managed by its executive director at the time, Aryeh Neier. Staff and volunteer lawyers ranged in age from late 20's to late 40's.</p>
        <p>Care, and not chaos, marked the quality of the legal work. My office at the A.C.L.U. was no more, indeed less, threadbare than my faculty office at Columbia Law School, and I never encountered the remains of a pizza lingering under a chair.</p>
        <p>It hardly detracts from Ira's good work and the good work of his staff to recognize that they carried forward the good work of their predecessors.</p>
