        <p>In the end, the summer movie season was neither as lucrative as it looked at its onset nor as disastrous as it appeared at its midpoint, but what exactly was it?</p>
        <p>In raw numbers, the movie season that ran from Memorial Day to Labor Day, traditionally Hollywood's most lucrative period, generated $2.7 billion at the box office, about $200 million less than last year's record. Eleven of the films released earned more than $100 million each, and one or two others may eventually surpass that mark.</p>
        <p>Not so bad, on the face of it. But there were some disquieting details beneath the surface.</p>
        <p>While overall box office looked fairly strong, even in comparison with last year's sizzling pace, that was partly because of an increase in ticket prices. In fact, attendance at movies was down significantly, by 9 to 15 percent, depending on what the National Association of Theater Owners concludes was the summer's average ticket price, said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, a Los Angeles company that monitors box office performance.</p>
        <p>And while there were just as many $100 million movies this summer as last, there was only one $200 million movie (''M:I-2,'' the season's biggest hit at $214 million), compared with three last summer (''Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace,'' ''Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' and ''The Sixth Sense''). At the same time, many movies that opened quite strongly this summer quickly fell off.</p>
        <p>But most disturbing to many in the movie business was that people just weren't talking about movies this summer. Last year, the hottest topics of conversation and magazine covers were the new ''Star Wars'' prequel and the surprise success of ''The Sixth Sense'' and ''The Blair Witch Project.'' This year, no movie seemed to generate that kind of buzz.</p>
        <p>''People's attention was on other things,'' Mr. Dergarabedian said. ''Last summer, to be included in the discussion you had to go see 'Blair Witch' or ''Sixth Sense.' This year, you had to watch 'Survivor' on television to be part of what everyone was talking about. There was nothing on the order of a cultural phenomenon, which is what you need to keep attendance from falling flat or dipping. General malaise sort of overtook the summer.''</p>
        <p>Part of the problem, some said, was that the summer of 1999 was such an unusual one, kicked off by a frenzy over the ''Star Wars'' film and then powered by one major hit after another. It was unfair, they said, to expect a subsequent summer to live up to that.</p>
        <p>''The summer of '99 was an extraordinary summer, and I think that to use it as a benchmark is difficult,'' said Robert G. Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture Group. ''You need to look over the last three years and, when you do, that tells you that the summer of 2000 was a very good summer, equal to or even better than '97 and '98.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Friedman said he was not overly concerned about the attendance drop. ''Our business is movie-driven,'' he said. ''It's not as though people have gone to other forms of entertainment. It's not as though we've lost them as future moviegoers. They've just responded to the product that's been offered to them.''</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the summer movie season begins on Memorial Day, but the trend in recent years has been to release big-budget, summer-oriented films earlier and earlier. This year, for instance, Ridley Scott's ''Gladiator,'' the summer's second-biggest hit at $184 million, opened the first weekend in May, followed by Disney's ''Dinosaur'' ($136 million) in mid-May. Then came a record-breaking Memorial Day weekend led by ''M:I-2'' and, shortly after, the surprise success of Martin Lawrence's ''Big Momma's House'' ($116 million).</p>
        <p>After that, moviegoers seemed to get pickier, and it was not until after a monthlong slump that the box office revived over the Independence Day weekend, thanks in part to Wolfgang Peterson's ''Perfect Storm'' (at $178 million, the summer's third-biggest hit). Other hits followed, like ''Scary Movie,'' a $19 million spoof of teenage slasher films that has earned nearly $150 million, and more expected successes like ''Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps'' ($115 million) and ''X-Men'' ($153 million).</p>
        <p>By August, however, ticket sales had cooled again.</p>
        <p>''The bottom sort of fell out,'' Mr. Dergarabedian said. ''We ended up the summer with 10 out of 15 weekends performing more poorly than the same weekends last summer, and you just can't recover from that.''</p>
        <p>One problem was that, except perhaps for ''Scary Movie,'' the summer produced nothing like the kind of sleeper success enjoyed by ''Sixth Sense.'' And outside of a few films, notably Robert Zemeckis's ''What Lies Beneath'' (which has earned $137 million and is still attracting audiences) and Clint Eastwood's ''Space Cowboys,'' the summer releases did not seem to hold on at the box office week after week, indicating that people were not telling friends to go see them.</p>
        <p>Particularly disquieting to studios and theater owners is that no movie coming out of the summer seems likely to run strongly into September, as ''Sixth Sense'' did last year. And with the Olympics about to begin and few major releases in the immediate offing, there are fears that it will not be until after the World Series and the presidential election -- until November, that is, and the release of the big holiday films -- that the box office will recharge.</p>
        <p>''I think it's been a good summer, though obviously not a great summer,'' said Jim Tharp, head of distribution for DreamWorks. ''I think it always goes back to the movies. Now, we have more theaters, more conveniently located, more up-to-date and nicer to be in, so that would seem to indicate you'd get more attendance. But we didn't. So the issue has to be the movies.''</p>
