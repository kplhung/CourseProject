        <p>It did not matter to Todd Martin if the Nielsen families had turned in for the night, or how many people were missing the amazing revival he was staging inside Arthur Ashe Stadium.</p>
        <p>As Tuesday night spilled into Wednesday morning, the graying 30-year-old was pointing to the crowd as Jimmy Connors once did during his epic battles at the United States Open, and he was peeling back the layers of his reserved exterior. As the fifth set neared completion, Martin plunged right into the frat house atmosphere that erupted during his four-hour, fourth-round comeback against Carlos Moya.</p>
        <p>His impromptu celebration was for those who stayed behind to hoot and holler to the emotionally draining end. Once he accomplished his improbable 6-7 (3), 6-7 (7), 6-1, 7-6 (6), 6-2 victory at 1:19 a.m., and cracked his racket on the hardcourt in an outburst of emotion, Martin trotted around the court and hugged some of the stragglers who braved the chill in the air.</p>
        <p>''That was everything,'' Martin said yesterday afternoon. ''That was wanting them to know how happy I was, wanting them to know how pleased I was that they could be a part of it.''</p>
        <p>After his celebration ended, Martin spent the next two hours recovering in a trainer's room. He was hooked up to an IV, received a rubdown and did not return to his hotel until 4:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>Less than 12 hours later, the unseeded Martin was back at the National Tennis Center, going through a workout and receiving treatment yesterday.</p>
        <p>When his quarterfinal match against the unseeded Thomas Johansson rolls around today, Martin expects his rebound to be complete. He had faith that his muscles would snap back, and his emotions would still be intact.</p>
        <p>''It was a lot of fun,'' Martin said. ''It's a matter of losing your inhibitions and letting people see what's inside of you.''</p>
        <p>Almost one year ago, Martin pulled a similar comeback here when he found himself down two sets to love against Greg Rusedski in the fourth round.</p>
        <p>But again, his miracle unfolded after midnight.</p>
        <p>His more visible moments have come in the harsh light of day. In 1996, he had a commanding fifth-set lead against MaliVai Washington in the Wimbledon semifinals but his composure buckled on the grass. In June, he was in control of the fifth set against Andre Agassi in Wimbledon's second round, but lost again.</p>
        <p>In one way, it seems unfair for his blemishes to be so discernible and his heroics so unnoticed. But Martin is eternally positive, a quality that seems to energize him when he goes head to head with doom, so he doesn't see it that way.</p>
        <p>''I'll always remember my matches at Wimbledon against Mal and Andre,'' Martin said. ''I think life is incredibly fair or else we wouldn't be able to learn from our mistakes.''</p>
