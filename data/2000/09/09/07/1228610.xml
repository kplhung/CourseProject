        <p>I think there is one real argument in the Napster controversy that has not been made.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I think there is one real argument in the Napster controversy that has not been made. I download songs on Napster occasionally, but only songs that I have previously purchased on a record or tape, which is a huge number of songs. In fact, I believe that I have already purchased the right to do that by purchasing an album in the past.</p>
        <p>For instance, I bought a tape several years ago, but it became useless after about 18 months. Rather than buy it again and paying twice for the right to have a copy of the song (the mechanical royalty) I downloaded the one and only song I wanted from the album on Napster. I wanted to add that song to my performance repertoire and, as a result, the songwriter is receiving performance royalties he may not otherwise have gotten (at least theoretically) from the places where I play it.</p>
        <p>If an artist or record company has already received a mechanical royalty payment from me, why should I pay twice? It should also be pointed out that the performance royalties, the bulk of which go directly to the artist and songwriter and not the record companies, are not affected at all by Napster.</p>
