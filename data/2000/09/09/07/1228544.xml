        <p>The Central Intelligence Agency says Iraq has consistently used the United Nations' oil-for-food program to reward countries that call for ending economic sanctions against Iraq, and to punish those that oppose lifting the embargo, administration officials familiar with the findings have said.</p>
        <p>The officials said the C.I.A. stated in a new report that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has given the bulk of contracts in the program to China, France and Russia, as well as to other vocal champions of lifting the sanctions. The Security Council imposed the sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 to force Iraq to give up weapons of mass destruction.</p>
        <p>The Council instituted the oil-for-food program in 1996 to let Iraq sell some of its oil to help ease the suffering of ordinary Iraqis reportedly caused by the sanctions. But the C.I.A. study shows that Iraq has also used the program as a lever to pry open the sanctions by rewarding allies with contracts, especially those on the 15-member Security Council. The Council can vote to lift the sanctions, and to punish its foes.</p>
        <p>''Over the life of the program, Baghdad has awarded one-third of the contracts to France, Russia and China,'' the report states. ''Besides these Security Council members and neighbors, Iraq has given substantial oil-for-food business to others that deliver antisanctions rhetoric.''</p>
        <p>Iraq has even denied contracts to traditional suppliers who have not called for an end to sanctions. The report notes that Japan and Germany, Iraq's two largest suppliers before the gulf war, have each received ''only 1 percent of total contracts.''</p>
        <p>The two-page report is accompanied by charts and graphs that demonstrate the strong correlation between support for lifting sanctions and the awarding of contracts under the program, which is now in what the United Nations accounting system calls Phase 8. Each phase corresponds to a period of 180 days.</p>
        <p>Copies of several of the graphs and charts were provided to The New York Times, and sections of the report were read to a reporter by officials who had read the report and thought that its conclusions should be more widely known.</p>
        <p>The report, which was completed last month and is secret, is little surprise to the Clinton administration, Iraq's most vocal critic on the Security Council and the chief advocate of continuing the sanctions until Iraq proves that it has abandoned its programs for nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. But the report is quite likely to reinforce administration frustration over the mounting pressure among nations and aid organizations to lift the sanctions on the ground that they inflict undue hardship on the Iraqi people.</p>
        <p>In response to such pressures last year, the Security Council lifted the ceiling on how much oil Baghdad could sell. As a result, United Nations records show, Iraqi oil exports have soared, as have the contracts for food, medicine and other social programs. In the part of Phase 8 from June 9 to Aug. 25, Iraq earned $3.8 billion in oil revenues.</p>
        <p>Iraq is pumping two million barrels of oil a day.</p>
        <p>Based on United Nations statistics, the C.I.A. determined that contacts to Vietnam, for instance, began rising sharply in January 1998, after Vietnamese cabinet ministers endorsed an end to the sanctions, climbing from $50 million in 1998 to $170 million three phases later. Contracts to Lebanon jumped on two occasions, after Beirut denounced a four-day bombing series against Iraq, and after Lebanon sent an aide for commercial liaison to Baghdad.</p>
        <p>Although 40 percent of Iraqi oil exports eventually wind up in the United States, Washington, not surprisingly, has sold almost nothing to Baghdad under the program.</p>
