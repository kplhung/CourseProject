        <p>A mob led by militiamen brandishing automatic rifles and homemade firearms attacked a United Nations refugee office in West Timor today, killing three staff members, including a person from Puerto Rico, and possibly another aid worker. The attack prompted outrage halfway around the world at a summit meeting of world leaders here.</p>
        <p>The 149 leaders included Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid, who, embarrassed by the failure of his army and police based on the troubled island to prevent the rampage, attributed it on grieving supporters of a local militia leader who died under mysterious circumstances on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid promised to send two battalions of troops to reassert control, but it did not placate the fury at the United Nations, which has seen 193 of its peacekeepers and civilian workers killed in the line of duty since 1992.</p>
        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan, who was to have met with Mr. Wahid later this week, instead confronted him at a meeting today. Mr. Annan condemned the attack and told Mr. Wahid that the security situation in West Timor was unacceptable.</p>
        <p>Earlier, addressing the opening of the summit meeting, Mr. Annan said: ''This tragedy underlines once again the dangers faced by unarmed humanitarian workers serving the United Nations in conflict or post-conflict situations. The Security Council, and I myself, have repeatedly expressed concern about the safety of United Nations personnel in the field, both military and civilian.''</p>
        <p>The refugee agency identified the dead as Carlos Caceres-Collazo from Puerto Rico, Sampson Areghegn from Ethiopia and Pero Simundza from Croatia. A statement issued later by the Security Council referred to the possible death of a fourth international aid worker but did not give any details.</p>
        <p>The Council was briefed on the attack by Bernard Miyet, the head of United Nations peacekeeping operations, and Sadako Ogata, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. Mrs. Ogata read to the Council an e-mail message that Mr. Caceres-Collazo had tapped out shortly before he was killed. According to a diplomat present, it said in part:</p>
        <p>''You should see this office. Plywood on the windows, staff peering out through openings in the curtains hastily installed a few minutes ago. We are waiting for this enemy. We sit here like bait, unarmed, waiting for wave to hit.''</p>
        <p>''I am glad to be leaving this island for three weeks,'' Mr. Caceres-Collazo wrote. ''I just hope I will be able to leave tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ogata ordered the evacuation of the refugee agency's workers in West Timor, in effect suspending aid to more than 100,000 refugees in the region. Barely suppressing her anger at a briefing for journalists, she called the rampage the worst security incident that her office had seen.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ogata said she protested the attack in ''an encounter'' with President Wahid today. She reported that he had expressed feelings of mourning for the slain refugee workers, and had told her that one of the two promised battalions was already on its way to West Timor.</p>
        <p>But after the strained meeting, Mrs. Ogata said: ''I would like to insist that the president of Indonesia implement security measures. Words are not enough anymore. I want facts.''</p>
        <p>Violence has ravaged the divided island of Timor since last year, when militias opposed to independence from Indonesia attacked residents of East Timor who had voted for secession, killing or wounding many of them and razing some villages. Nearly 300,000 East Timorese fled for safety to the western part of the island. An estimated 170,000 of the refugees have since returned home, but up to 125,000 remain in West Timor, where militias have continued to prey on them, despite appeals by the United Nations and others for the Indonesian government to intervene.</p>
        <p>''It's not something that happened all of a sudden,'' Mrs. Ogata said of today's rampage. ''It's just expressed in the worst possible way.''</p>
        <p>According to her staff, the attack on the refugee office in the impoverished town of Atambua was prompted by a funeral for Olivio Mendonca, a militia leader also known as Moruk.</p>
        <p>''The man killed was the head of one of the most notorious and criminal militia groups of East Timor,'' Mr. Caceres-Collazo wrote in his e-mail. ''These guys act without thinking and can kill a human as easily (and painlessly) as I kill mosquitoes in my room.''</p>
        <p>Shortly thereafter, dozens of militants from the funeral procession of more than 1,000 mourners stormed and trashed the refugee office, beat Mr. Caceres-Collazo and his two colleagues to death, set fire to their vehicles and stole equipment, including radios needed for contact with other United Nations offices on the island.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials said the refugee agency suspended operations for six days in West Timor last month after several employees were badly beaten but resumed work on Aug. 29 following assurances of security from the Indonesian authorities.</p>
        <p>By this evening, 14 United Nations employees and 30 workers for other relief organizations, including some local employees in Atambua, were plucked out by helicopter and flown to Dili, the capital of East Timor. Others were reported still hiding from the mob. Frederic Eckhard, the secretary general's spokesman, declined to give details to avoid putting their lives at risk.</p>
        <p>The United Nations has more than 8,000 military peacekeepers deployed in East Timor, but their mandate restricts them to providing security and supporting reconstruction in that territory in preparation for formal independence from Indonesia, probably next year. Two peacekeepers were killed in a clash with militiamen this summer.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ogata said her agency's employees still in West Timor, including about 50 in its capital, Kupang, would be pulled out on Thursday, and would not go back until their security was guaranteed.</p>
        <p>E-Mail Message By U.N. Worker</p>
        <p>Following is an excerpt from an e-mail message sent by Carlos Caceres-Collazo, one of the United Nations workers killed yesterday, shortly before his murder, as provided by a diplomat. The United Nations high commissioner for refugees, Sadako Ogata, read it to the Security Council.</p>
        <p>I was in the office when the news came out that a wave of violence would soon pound Atambua. We sent most of the staff home, rushing to safety. I just heard someone on the radio saying that they are praying for us in the office. The militias are on the way, and I am sure they will do their best to demolish this office.</p>
        <p>The man killed was the head of one of the most notorious and criminal militia groups of East Timor. These guys act without thinking and can kill a human as easily (and painlessly) as I kill mosquitos in my room.</p>
        <p>You should see this office. Plywood on the windows, staff peering out through openings in the curtains hastily installed a few minutes ago. We are waiting for this enemy, we sit here like bait, unarmed, waiting for wave to hit.</p>
