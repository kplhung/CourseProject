        <p>The wrangling over the presidential debates intensified yesterday, as Vice President Al Gore continued to insist that Gov. George W.

        <p>''I'm going to Washington, you bet,'' Mr. Bush said on NBC's ''Today'' show, in response to a question about his proposed debate on ''Meet the Press'' with Tim Russert on Tuesday at 10 p.m. Eastern daylight time.

        <p>The wrangling over the presidential debates intensified yesterday, as Vice President Al Gore continued to insist that Gov. George W. Bush accept an independent commission's schedule of debates, while Mr. Bush vowed to show up next week for a television debate he helped to set up regardless of whether Mr. Gore was there.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to Washington, you bet,'' Mr. Bush said on NBC's ''Today'' show, in response to a question about his proposed debate on ''Meet the Press'' with Tim Russert on Tuesday at 10 p.m. Eastern daylight time. ''It's on my schedule. And I hope he's there. After all, it was on Mr. Russert's show, where he clearly said that he would show up if I showed up, and I'm showing up.''</p>
        <p>But NBC officials said there would be no edition of ''Meet the Press'' on Tuesday if Mr. Gore was not on hand.</p>
        <p>''Our offer of a debate has always been contingent upon acceptance by both candidates,'' said Barbara Levin, an NBC spokeswoman. ''We have no interest in favoring one candidate or another.''</p>
        <p>All the maneuvering has left the staging of any debates up in the air. The Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group that has been running the candidate showdowns since 1988, has a longstanding invitation to both contenders to appear in three debates on college campuses in October, an offer Mr. Gore accepted months ago. On Sunday, Mr. Bush countered with his own  plan, which included one of the 90-minute commission debates but replaced the others with one-hour forums on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' next week and CNN's ''Larry King Live'' on Oct. 3.</p>
        <p>The commission has invited the campaigns to meet to settle their differences, but thus far only the Gore campaign has agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who denounced Mr. Bush's offer as an effort to duck the commission debates because he was trying to limit the viewers, has said he is amenable to debating on the two programs. But he added that Mr. Bush must first consent to the commission's debates, which traditionally are broadcast live across the spectrum of major broadcast and cable news networks.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush's plan would make it impossible for the candidates to adhere to the commission's schedule, because the date for the proposed encounter on Mr. King's program -- Oct. 3 -- is the same as the first commission debate, at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. Aides to Mr. Bush last week had expressed particular opposition to that debate, because of the university's proximity to the John F. Kennedy Library, an institution honoring a Democratic president.</p>
        <p>Asked whether CNN had been made a party, perhaps unwittingly, to efforts to scuttle the Boston debate, CNN said that it was the candidates who had the power over the schedule and that the Bush campaign itself chose the Oct. 3 date.</p>
        <p>''They are in control of when and where they debate,'' said Christa Robinson, a CNN spokeswoman. ''What CNN did was put an offer on the table that did not have a specific date on it.'' But, she added that no debate would occur without Mr. Gore's participation.</p>
        <p>The degree to which Mr. Bush is pushing his counterproposal was underscored yesterday, when the Bush campaign introduced a new commercial taunting the vice president for not accepting Mr. Bush's debate plan.</p>
        <p>''When it was politically convenient, Gore said he'd debate 'anytime, anyplace, anywhere,' '' an announcer says, concluding, ''If we can't trust Al Gore on debates, why should we trust him on anything?''</p>
        <p>The commercial drew an immediate condemnation from the Gore campaign, which contended that it was Mr. Bush who was practicing debate avoidance.</p>
        <p>''It's just the latest act of political chicanery,'' said Chris Lehane, the Gore campaign press secretary. ''The bottom line is, he's bobbing and weaving and dodging by not putting the debates before the largest number of people possible.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's alternative plan drew complaints from other corners. Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee for president, sent letters to all the major cable and broadcast networks yesterday, asking that he be included in any debates they show. Mr. Nader wrote that the inclusion of him and the Reform Party candidate Patrick J. Buchanan would, among other things, make the debates more entertaining.</p>
