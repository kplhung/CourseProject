        <p>RICHARD C. YOUNGKEN, a city planner with an eye for design disasters, pulled into a parking lot next to a busy four-lane road in Middletown, R.I., and looked up.</p>
        <p>There it was, a perfect specimen: a rugged brown utility pole that stood at least 40 feet high, topped with transformers and strung with wires leading off in every direction.</p>
        <p>There were electric lines, telephone lines, cable television lines, even lines for the city's fire alarms -- all of them joining on this tar-stained totem of technological ingenuity.</p>
        <p>''It's just like, 'Good God, what have you got on that pole?' '' Mr. Youngken said incredulously, craning his head out the window before driving off to point out the next eyesore.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of miles south, at a house in Faulkier County, Va., Fred Smith has his own problem with visual pollution. Through a window, he said, he can see a 200-foot cell phone tower that stands on a low ridge against an otherwise uninterrupted view of the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p>
        <p>''They are putting them up all over the place,'' said Mr. Smith, who has written a letter to his local newspaper declaring the towers ''this century's blight.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith and Mr. Youngken are just two crusaders in a growing movement against the encroachment of obtrusive, ugly technology into daily life. It is time, participants say, to realize that the devices  we use in our cars and houses can have an impact on our physical environments. Some people may be fortunate enough to live in cities or newly developed suburbs where wires, cables, transmitters and receivers are buried underground or hidden on rooftops. But for many Americans, those wires and towers are all too visible.</p>
        <p>In the last few years, people have started to fight for measures that will at least reduce the visual blight. Local government meetings are full of heated discussions about what can be done, and in extreme cases, what lawsuits should be filed. City planners are talking to utility and telecommunications companies, trying to fend off obtrusive additions to the landscape.</p>
        <p>Some people active in the campaign are becoming well versed in the intricacies of telephone transmission lines and cellular equipment so they can argue intelligently with those who install them.</p>
        <p>''People care about how these things look,'' said Mr. Youngken, who is the director of the Dunn Foundation, a small organization in Warwick, R.I., that is dedicated to raising awareness of the value of well-planned, pedestrian-friendly towns and cities. Part of the foundation's mission is to show people that the underpinnings of technology can be hidden.</p>
        <p>''The hope,'' he said, ''is that more people will expect it -- and demand it.''</p>
        <p>More than 73,000 cell phone towers with heights of at least 200 feet are scattered across the American landscape, according to the Federal Communications Commission. But that does not include myriad other cellular transmitters and receivers, called cell sites, that are placed on lower towers or on poles and buildings. Some experts estimate that more than 100,000 cell sites are now in place.</p>
        <p>Ted Kreines, a consultant in Tiburon, Calif., who advises local governments on doing business with telecommunications companies, said that the growth of such technology is just beginning. He estimated  that as many as one million cell sites would be installed by the time technology companies reached their desired capacity for wireless data and voice transmissions.</p>
        <p>Utility poles and wires are even more common. According to the F.C.C., more than 180 million telephone cables stretch across the country. The country has more than three million miles of overhead power lines, according to the Edison Electric Institute, an association of utility companies.</p>
        <p>Fewer than 100,000 miles of lines are underground, the institute says, and most of those buried lines are in large cities. For example, American Electric Power, a large power company with customers in 11 Midwestern states, has buried only 12.3 percent of the lines that carry electricity along streets to houses and offices in its coverage areas.</p>
        <p>Newer tendrils of technology are also beginning to entwine themselves around communities. Fiber optic cable, the backbone of many future high-speed Internet  lines, can be now seen along some highways on utility poles. Television stations, which are required by the F.C.C. to deliver digital broadcasts by 2003, have asked the agency for permission to pre-empt local regulations controlling the number and size of towers so they can put up more towers. Metricom, a company that has built wireless data networks in Atlanta and San Diego so far, is putting radio transceivers on top of street lamps and traffic lights.</p>
        <p>''Nobody realizes there are all these things going up there,'' Mr. Kreines said. ''It's happening all over the country.''</p>
        <p>Two seemingly unrelated trends have led to today's landscapes -- and to the current fights over control of them. Telecommunications experts say that deregulation is partly responsible.</p>
        <p>The Telecommunications Act of 1996 not  only led to more competition among providers of phone and cable services (and therefore more towers and cables), but also included a provision that protected companies from being shut out by local zoning laws. Under the 1996 law, no city or town can keep a cell phone company from putting up sites within its borders. The law adds, however, that local governments may have some say over the locations of the towers that are about to spring up in their midst and how they look.</p>
        <p>That is where the second trend comes in. While planning boards and zoning laws have long been in place, planning experts say, residents of cities and towns are starting to look at how those regulations relate to the overall aesthetics and characters of their communities.</p>
        <p>''Americans are waking up to design,'' Mr. Youngken said. He has helped several towns create strategic development plans and has found that one of their first goals is to bury the above-ground utility lines. And when towns plan for the future, he said, some of their first thoughts how to avoid being overrun by cell phone towers.</p>
        <p>Property values play a big role, too. The Dunn Foundation, in its research on utility lines, has found that real estate prices increase in places where lines have been buried. Mr. Kreines has seen real estate values drop when cell phone towers have been installed nearby. In a case in Ho Ho Kus, N.J., he said, a tax assessor determined that the aggregated value of property near a cell phone tower would drop as much as $660,000.</p>
        <p>Telecommunications companies say they are trying to balance two opposing desires: cellular customers want clearer calls, and property owners want unobstructed views.  But the companies say they try to be sensitive to aesthetics.</p>
        <p>''We do the best we can to keep our facilities from looking unsightly,'' said Tracey Kennedy, a spokeswoman for Verizon, which provides wireless and conventional telephone service. ''The last thing you want,'' she said, ''are your constituents to be up in arms about their surroundings.''</p>
        <p>Some communities have found that companies are responsive to their requests. Several have asked cell phone companies to install cell sites on top of light poles or on buildings where they are less noticeable. And camouflaging is becoming more popular for the sites. Some cell phone companies have made cell phone towers look like pine trees, and in Arizona and California, cell sites that look like giant saguaro cactuses  rise 35 feet above the desert.</p>
        <p>When compromises cannot be reached, battles erupt. Search the Internet for ''cell phone towers,'' and you will find dozens of Web sites that have been posted by people protesting the erection of towers that block their views.</p>
        <p>In many cases, wireless companies have sued municipalities for the right to go forward with their plans. In others, local governments have sued to prevent construction. Mr. Kreines lists about 15 cases on his Web site (www.planwireless.com).</p>
        <p>A few years ago, most cell-site lawsuits were won by the telecommunications companies. But some observers say that is changing as municipalities realize that they can place limits on construction and still stay within the law.</p>
        <p>For example, in a case last year against Albemarle County in Virginia, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled in favor of the county. The county's board of supervisors had denied an application filed by 360degrees Communications, a company that wanted to install a 100-foot tower on a ridge called Dudley Mountain. The company sued, but the appeals court ruled that the denial of that single tower did not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless services. The county board, for example, might someday permit other towers or poles in other places.</p>
        <p>Getting rid of ugly utility lines may be a tougher fight. Cities and property owners are usually expected to cover the costs of taking down the wires and burying them, a practice known as ''undergrounding.'' The cost to communities can run from $500,000 to $3 million per mile, said Dan Weaver, an urban planner who coordinates a San Francisco campaign to bury utility wires.</p>
        <p>Technical challenges contribute to the high costs, said Dave Gordon, a manager for American Electric Power. Construction crews, for example, must avoid things like water and sewer lines when they excavate. And while underground wires are protected from falling trees or high winds, Mr. Gordon said, they are often harder and costlier to repair when something does go wrong.</p>
        <p>But many cities and towns argue that the benefits of putting wires underground outweigh the disadvantages. Planners show photographs of cities in the early 20th century, when a haphazard sprawl of telephone and electrical cables crisscrossed every street. In new suburban developments, most developers do not even consider installing above-ground lines.</p>
        <p>At least nine states have granted municipalities the authority to create special districts that could tax residents to cover those costs, according to the Dunn Foundation. In California, for example, a surcharge is added to utility bills to pay for burying wires in areas where landowners are also willing to pay for land surveys, connection fees, new street lighting and the cost of administering the special districts. Those services, Mr. Weaver said, can cost residents as much as $7,000 each.</p>
        <p>But those who oppose unsightly towers and overhead wires say that is not enough. The California plan does not work, Mr. Weaver said, because the areas with the most overhead wires are usually populated by people on low or fixed incomes, who generally can't afford to pay to bury the wires.</p>
        <p>''More and more people are getting upset because undergrounding just never happens,'' Mr. Weaver said. The joke in San Francisco, he added, is that some areas are on a ''300-year undergrounding plan.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weaver is researching new ways to pay for putting wires underground. One possibility, he said, is to charge a fee to property buyers and sellers in areas where wires are still overhead. That is no different, he said, from the fees that are typically included in the cost of houses in new developments where wires are buried.</p>
        <p>Other options, Mr. Youngken said, include trying to hide the lines above ground.</p>
        <p>As he continued his recent drive through the suburbs of Rhode Island, he described some of those efforts. Some cash-strapped towns have managed to move the wires to alleys or have requested heavy-duty wire that can be strung through tree branches. At the very least, he said, communities should require utility companies to get rid of unnecessary poles.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Youngken talked, he passed a sign for Newport, R.I., which recently put some of its utility lines underground. ''Now look,'' he said, pointing at the scenery whizzing by. The poles suddenly disappeared, and nothing but grassy lawns sloped down to a tranquil waterfront on the roadside.</p>
        <p>''What a difference,'' he said. ''Isn't it amazing?''</p>
