        <p>The Turkish police barred several hundred gay Americans today from visiting tourist sites near an Aegean port, Kusadasi, and ordered them back aboard their cruise ship, prompting complaints from the State Department, officials said.</p>
        <p>Most of the tourists, who are on what travel operators say is the largest gay cruise to visit Turkey, were rounded up from locations ashore, ordered to board their buses and escorted by the police back to the ship, according to State Department and White House officials, as well as people who spoke with passengers.</p>
        <p>Other passengers were prevented from leaving the area where their ship, the Olympic Voyager, was docked. About 800 gay tourists are on the cruise.</p>
        <p>American diplomats protested to the Turkish Foreign Ministry and raised the concern that the Americans were being mistreated because of their sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>''We asked that the tourists be allowed to continue their tour of Turkey unencumbered,'' said Philip Reeker, a spokesman for the State Department.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Reeker said the facts surrounding the incident were sketchy, he confirmed the police actions. ''Obviously,'' he said, ''we're dismayed at the actions. That's why we contacted the Turkish officials.''</p>
        <p>The tour operator decided to continue the cruise, which is scheduled to reach Istanbul on Thursday. The State Department has asked the American consul general to meet the travelers and to help ensure that there are no further problems, Mr. Reeker said.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the Turkish Embassy in Washington, Sensu Yemisci, said she did not have specific information about the incident. But she disputed a suggestion that Turks were not tolerant of gays and noted that the beach resort of Bodrum, not far from Kusadasi, also near Samos, was popular among homosexual tourists. She called the allegations of police bias absurd.</p>
        <p>''There are hundreds of thousands of gays in Turkey,'' Ms. Yemisci said. ''Probably, ordinary people don't like it very much. But it doesn't make any difference.''</p>
        <p>David Mixner, a gay Democratic Party campaigner who spoke by telephone with the tour organizer in Turkey, said the Turkish police had told the tourists that they were not allowed ashore because of their homosexuality. Mr. Mixner said he spoke with Rich Campbell of Atlantis Events, the operator, which has its headquarters in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''They were not allowed off the ship because they were gay,'' Mr. Mixner said. ''This was not a secret. There was no issue other than that. There was no inappropriate behavior or confrontation. They were tourists.''</p>
        <p>The weeklong luxury cruise was to include stops to see the Parthenon in Greece, the Pyramids in Egypt and Israeli holy sites. In promotional material, Atlantis, the largest American tour operator that caters to gays, described the trip as ''unlike any Atlantis has ever offered.''</p>
        <p>The incident was the third time that Atlantis has faced a significant confrontation abroad.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the Cayman Islands, a Caribbean destination renowned for its scuba diving, notified Atlantis that it would not allow its cruise ship to dock. The tour was rerouted to Belize.</p>
        <p>Also that year, members of an Atlantis group faced small public protests in Costa Rica. Government officials subsequently apologized, Atlantis officials said.</p>
