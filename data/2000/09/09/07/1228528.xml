        <p>ARTHUR ASHE was not one for fig leaves -- symbolic fig leaves, anyway. His views regarding human and race relations -- as well, as I recall, virtually any other subject -- were never anything but direct. You asked Arthur Ashe a question and he gave you not only what was on his insightful mind, but what was in his heart, as well.</p>
        <p>It's also true, however, that there is no record of his ever having played naked in a tennis tournament.</p>
        <p>The latter has contributed to some of the controversy regarding that big bronze guy in the tree-shaded Arthur Ashe Commemorative Garden outside Arthur Ashe Stadium in the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. So has the musculature. It's more Rodin, or Arnold Schwarzenegger, than the lithe Ashe.</p>
        <p>Big Bronze Guy stands tall -- 14 feet tall, as a matter of fact -- and, without even benefit of a towel around his waist, tosses up a ball that has forever disappeared into the sky as he serves.</p>
        <p>''What's that supposed to be -- a broken tennis racket?'' said Rose Giaramita, a hair stylist from Forest Hills, Queens. ''I don't get the whole thing.''</p>
        <p>The racket indeed appears to be sawed-off, suggesting perhaps something lethal, which Ashe's serve often was.</p>
        <p>''That's Arthur Ashe?'' said Isaac Manjo, a Maryland insurance agent. ''That's crazy.''</p>
        <p>''It's a wonderful display, it's a wonderful statement -- there is a power and a stature to it, which reflects Arthur Ashe,'' said Janet Cook of Philadelphia, ''but I'm offended by the nudity.''</p>
        <p>Daniel Burgess of Freeport, N.Y., loathed the statue to such a degree that he handed out copies of a letter drafted to the United States Tennis Association demanding the immediate removal of the statue. He said he had gotten 1,000 signatures.</p>
        <p>To no avail. ''The statue stays,'' said Judy Levering, president of the U.S.T.A. ''The sculpture is not a depiction of Arthur; it is a representation honoring his legacy and memory. Some of the confusion may be in that the artist's name for it is not in the Garden, 'Soul in Flight.' We probably should fix that.''</p>
        <p>Art is always in the eye of the beholder. You read it here first. And art objects can have such emotional affect that they are sometimes defaced or defamed, or, conversely, seen as depictions of faith.</p>
        <p>In front of the United Center in Chicago, an iconic sculpture of Michael Jordan soaring for a dunk shot has been generally hailed. People throw coins at the foot of it, as though it were a wishing well.</p>
        <p>But only a few miles away, the abstract Picasso sculpture in front of City Hall drew a different response. It's ''a heroic monument to some dead dodo, a Barbary ape, or some sort of Trojan dove,'' said Alderman John J. Hoellen at the unveiling several years ago. Dump it in Lake Michigan, he said, and put up a statue of Ernie Banks.</p>
        <p>There is still no statue of Banks, the former Cubs star, but many athletes have been memorialized in this fashion. And all of them, from Stan Musial in St. Louis to Willie Mays in San Francisco to Dan Marino in Florida, are representational -- but unlike, say, Michelangelo's David and Eric Fischl's Big Bronze Guy, they are also conventionally frocked.</p>
        <p>Police Officer Frank Casaburi was assigned to a beat beside the statue. ''My supervisor told me that it's pretty controversial,'' he said, ''and that some people may not understand it. But we've had no incidents. Personally, I think it's beautiful.''</p>
        <p>While Isaac Manjo, who moved to America from his native Liberia, was initially put off by the sculpture not being a likeness of Ashe, he seemed to appreciate the rest of it. ''I get a sense of a man struggling, struggling to achieve,'' he said. ''Arthur Ashe was a role model for me, and for many black folks. And if it wasn't for his struggles, the doors wouldn't have been open for players like Venus and Serena Williams.''</p>
        <p>And while many fans were intent on seeing the sculpture, it is safe to say that they also had some interest in the other players, many of whom were at least 8-feet shorter, with more modest pectorals. But Lleyton Hewitt, who beat Arnaud Clement in his quarterfinal match yesterday, seemed to encapsulate the general opinion of the players.</p>
        <p>''What do you think of the statue?''</p>
        <p>''What statue?'' he replied.</p>
        <p>''The one outside the stadium.''</p>
        <p>''Don't know anything about it.''</p>
        <p>''You were just involved in the tennis itself?''</p>
        <p>Hewitt's eyebrows narrowed. ''I hope so,'' he said.</p>
