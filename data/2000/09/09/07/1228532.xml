        <p>Novell Inc. said yesterday that it would eliminate 900 jobs, or about 16 percent of its worldwide work force, in an effort to reduce costs.</p>
        <p>The company said it would take a pretax charge of $40 million to $50 million in its fourth quarter, which ends Oct. 31, reflecting the cuts.</p>
        <p>Once the powerhouse of computer networking software, Novell has struggled to remain relevant in the Internet age. Although a Web-enabled update of its core Netware product was well received two years ago, it sold primarily to existing users, and did not dent sales of the Microsoft Corporation's competing products, Windows NT and Windows 2000. Newer Novell products have been praised by critics but have not sold in large volumes.</p>
        <p>Novell shares closed yesterday at $10.69, down 37.5 cents, in Nasdaq trading, after falling 9 percent on Tuesday in expectation of the announcement.</p>
        <p>Analysts say that the layoffs, which will leave Novell with 4,600 employees, are necessary but that the company still needs to jump-start sales of new products to revive growth.</p>
        <p>Novell, which is based in Provo, Utah, said it expected to reduce total quarterly costs by approximately $25 million, beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2001. The reorganizing is part of management plans to focus the company on a new initiative to deliver software programs and performance enhancements as services on the Internet, while improving business performance.</p>
        <p>Total quarterly savings from the revamping are about $45 million, but increased spending on related Internet services initiatives will offset about $20 million of the initial quarterly savings, the company said.</p>
        <p>''We're reducing expenses over all, and we are also freeing up dollars to spend on key sales, marketing and development initiatives that are part of our strategic focus,'' Eric Schmidt, Novell's chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts.</p>
        <p>''Immediate benefit will come with the prospect of better earnings performance after lowering expenses,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''The greater objective is returning Novell to growth, increasing our investments in new Net services, while maintaining high levels of customer support.''</p>
        <p>Charles Phillips, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said that Novell had bought some time by updating Netware and adopting a more attractive pricing policy but had failed to come up with a strategy for new growth. ''The problem is in the software business quick fixes are rare, and you had to think of the solution two years ago to deliver it today,'' he said. ''They had an innovative product years ago but times have changed, so the prospects look pretty dim.''</p>
        <p>For the quarter ended July 31, Novell reported earnings of $8.6 million, or 3 cents a diluted share, down 82 percent from $49.3 million, or 14 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales fell 17 percent, to $270 million from $326.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 1999.</p>
        <p>As Novell's fortunes have slipped, the company has been the subject of  speculation and rumors about a possible takeover, perhaps by I.B.M.. Several analysts had published reports suggesting that the company would announce far larger numbers of layoffs than it did yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmidt said yesterday's announcement was the only one the company would make, and he objected to the flood of rumors that led up to it. ''Almost every piece of preceding information has been false in some way,'' he said. ''There have been some that are malicious.''</p>
        <p>Dennis Raney, Novell's chief financial officer, said he expected Novell to break even in its current fiscal fourth quarter, and to return to year-over-year growth after the first quarter of fiscal 2001. He said the company would confine revamping costs to the current quarter.</p>
