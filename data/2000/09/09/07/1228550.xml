        <p>Despite unusually sharp criticism from European antitrust regulators, executives of Time Warner and America Online do not plan to offer any concessions to clear their proposed merger plans when they meet regulators behind closed doors here on Thursday, company executives said today.</p>
        <p>Instead, the companies will try to refute European arguments that the merged company would harm competition because of its enormous size.</p>
        <p>That sets the stage for what is likely to be bruising negotiations over the next several weeks. But despite the American companies' seemingly hard line, many experts think that they will have to modify their plan before they receive permission to operate as a merged company in Europe.</p>
        <p>The European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, has sent the two companies a 45-page statement of objections, arguing that the merger in its current form would allow the companies to dominate the online distribution of entertainment and of music, in particular.</p>
        <p>According to people who have seen the statement, it warns that America Online and Time Warner would create a ''dominant position in the markets for online music delivery, music software, Internet dial-up access, broadband Internet access and integrated broadband content.''</p>
        <p>In explaining their concerns, European regulators here argued that the two companies would own so many forms of entertainment and information that America Online would be able to lock customers into its service. That in turn would give the combined company even more leverage in acquiring rights to music, videos and online information services.</p>
        <p>European concern has been magnified in Time Warner's separate plan to merge its music business into a joint venture with the EMI Group of Britain, the big music distributor. In an all-day hearing today, also in private, Time Warner and EMI executives tried to convince officials that the deal would be beneficial despite reducing the number of major music distributors to four from five.</p>
        <p>The battle in Europe is parallel but somewhat different from the one involving the companies in the United States, where regulators are also scrutinizing the merger.</p>
        <p>In the United States, America Online is by far the largest provider of Internet service. Time Warner is the nation's second-largest cable company and therefore controls the means to deliver high-speed Internet service to millions of homes.</p>
        <p>In Europe, the companies are significantly weaker. AOL Europe serves only about 10 percent of online subscribers and is no more than a distant second place in any market. And despite the Europeans' stated worries about Time Warner's potential control of broadband Internet access, the company owns no cable television or other high-speed networks in Europe.</p>
        <p>Kathy McKiernan, a spokeswoman for America Online, said today that the European Commission's objections were nothing more than ''a normal and predictable part of the process'' and that AOL would not offer any compromises when it presented it case.</p>
        <p>At the hearing, Time Warner and America Online will be questioned by senior members of the European Commission's merger task force. Antitrust regulators from each country in the European Union and representatives of at least a few companies that are fighting the merger will also take part.</p>
        <p>European arguments about the companies' grip on music are likely to be stronger because worldwide music distribution is already dominated by a handful of giants, and the combination of a Time Warner music operaton with EMI would concentrate the industry more.</p>
        <p>The European Commission has real power. It can block mergers between companies that generate European sales of more than 250 million euros a year, currently $217 million. On many occasions, including mergers between two American companies, officials have used their power to force companies into divestitures or changes in their practices.</p>
        <p>The commission's deadline to reach a final decision on Time Warner's deal with EMI is Oct. 16, and on its merger with America Online, Oct. 24. The companies have to submit proposed remedies at least one month before then.</p>
