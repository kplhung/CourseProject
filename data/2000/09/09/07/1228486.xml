        <p>PAGAN BABIES  By Elmore Leonard  263 Pages. Delacorte Press. $24.95</p>
        <p>In a move more apt to inspire compassion than readers' confidence, Elmore Leonard begins his latest novel with the grim aftermath of genocidal massacre in Rwanda. Five years earlier, 47 of the Rev. Terry Dunn's parishioners were murdered in church, and he still lives with the memory. Father Dunn also lives with an interestingly eclectic attitude toward his spiritual duties. When a Tutsi man confesses homicidal anger toward the Hutu who killed his family, the priest offers practical advice. '' 'Walk up to the guy,' Terry said, 'and hit him in the mouth as hard as you can, with a rock. You'll feel better.' ''</p>

        <p>PAGAN BABIES  By Elmore Leonard  263 Pages. Delacorte Press. $24.95</p>
        <p>In a move more apt to inspire compassion than readers' confidence, Elmore Leonard begins his latest novel with the grim aftermath of genocidal massacre in Rwanda. Five years earlier, 47 of the Rev. Terry Dunn's parishioners were murdered in church, and he still lives with the memory. Father Dunn also lives with an interestingly eclectic attitude toward his spiritual duties. When a Tutsi man confesses homicidal anger toward the Hutu who killed his family, the priest offers practical advice. '' 'Walk up to the guy,' Terry said, 'and hit him in the mouth as hard as you can, with a rock. You'll feel better.' ''</p>
        <p>As he describes Terry's quiet, haunted life in Africa, Mr. Leonard remains noticeably out of his element (though not nearly as far out as when he tried working rock lyrics into ''Be Cool,'' his shaky 1999 foray into the music business). But then, 50 pages into the story, the happily inevitable begins to happen. Circumstances force Terry to leave Rwanda in a hurry, and he returns to what is terra firma for this author: a Detroit filled with delusional schemers and fabulously inept hoods. And the pieces of this crime tale begin falling into place so handily that Mr. Leonard might as well have hung a ''Virtuoso at Work'' shingle on his door.</p>
        <p>Terry has a brother, Fran, who knows a woman named Debbie Dewey, who has ambitions as a stand-up comic. Debbie has been honing her act in a women's medium-security prison, a hard place to get laughs. The centerpiece of her act is an account of the event that landed her behind bars. ''True story,'' Debbie tells her audience. ''I was visiting my mom in Florida and happened to run into my ex-husband . . . with a Buick Riviera.'' Pause for effect. ''It was a rental, but it did the job.''</p>
        <p>Two salient things about Debbie: Terry, who raised eyebrows by living in not-so-priestly closeness with his Rwandan housekeeper, will be secular enough to like her style, and what she passes off as the true story of her automotive mishap is baloney.</p>
        <p>The car was a Ford Escort, but she thinks Riviera sounds classier. The ex-husband was really an ex-boyfriend, but she changed that detail for the same reason. She didn't mention that he conned her out of money by posing in a yachting cap and borrowing funds for imaginary nautical supplies. And she didn't hit him hard enough, because Randy Agley (ne Aglioni) is still around. Randy is a restaurateur who has hair like Michael Landon's, keeps a photograph of Soupy Sales over his desk and went through a brief phase of fashioning himself after Pierce Brosnan. Now his style inspiration is the mob.</p>
        <p>When Terry meets Debbie, and when he finds himself having to settle an old score about cigarette-smuggling charges from his unholy days, ''Pagan Babies'' hits its cool, sustainable stride. Mr. Leonard returns to the lean fluidity of his best work as he begins demonstrating how a proposed Little Orphans of Rwanda Fund may just spin off dividends for Terry and various other characters.</p>
        <p>The book's title, less enlightened, comes from Terry's school days, when ''there'd be a jar in the classroom and a sign that said FOR THE PAGAN BABIES, and we'd put change in it left from our lunch money.'' Fund-raising methods may have changed, but the scam artistry displayed by Mr. Leonard's latest crowd of miscreants is timeless.</p>
        <p>''Pagan Babies'' takes Terry seriously as a man of conscience, despite his wily way of navigating hoodlum-infested waters and his impressive dissembling. Thus, partly paralyzed by virtue, he remains a neutral hero, but the book that he anchors does not lack local color.</p>
        <p>As it moves entertainingly up the gangland food chain, escalating from tax-free cigarettes to mob hits and a scam to extort damages from Randy's restaurant, the story trots out an irresistible array of lowlifes. Randy, in particular, is a character actor's dream, what with the debonair manner of an ersatz yachtsman, the pretensions of a professional host and the paper-thin civility of a mob frontman.</p>
        <p>Told that he has to subsidize mob-controlled prostitutes at his restaurant for an exorbitant fee, Randy wearily raises no-win questions about the fairness of the deal. ''What you're telling me,'' he tells a mob intermediary, ''the girls could all quit and become stockbrokers, you still get your eight'' thousand ''a week.''</p>
        <p>The book is at its devilish best in a scene that has Randy interrogating Mutt, a potential hired killer who doesn't seem to know any tricks of the trade. ''I'd like to catch him someplace having his supper,'' says the would-be assassin. ''You don't mean here,'' Randy hastily replies. No, Mutt is imagining one of those mom-and-pop Italian restaurants that are required for gangland assassinations in movies. (''In the movies they're always sending to Detroit for a hit man, like they're sitting around waiting for calls,'' Terry remarks. ''Guy picks up the phone, 'Hit man, can I help you?' '')</p>
        <p>But Randy thinks it might be better to drive past and pop the victim. ''You do have a car?'' he asks Mutt. No, but Mutt has a pickup with a battery that often needs jump-starting. ''Or you could steal a car, just for the job,'' suggests Randy. ''I understand that's often the way it's done. You know, in case someone gets the license number.''</p>
        <p>Well, maybe. But then Mutt would need to worry about finding a parking place. Maybe a buddy could drive him, but he doesn't have any friends. Nor does he, unlike many more highly skilled hit men, have a gun.</p>
        <p>When the terms of the shooting are worked out, Mutt has one last question: ''But now which person was it again?''</p>
        <p>It will spoil none of the story's cunning, and probably surprise no one, to learn that Terry Dunn, a k a ''the priest,'' is the intended target. Or that Mutt, in the manner of Mr. Leonard's most memorable small-time operators, has a practical streak.</p>
        <p>''I guess it's O.K.,'' he decides. ''I'm a Baptist.''</p>
