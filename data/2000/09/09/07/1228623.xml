        <p>Moving quickly to shake up the leadership of the Police Department, Bernard B. Kerik, the new commissioner, announced yesterday that he was removing the assistant chief in the Bronx, where there has been a rise in murders, and the chief of uniformed officers.</p>
        <p>Police officials said Joanne Jaffe, the assistant chief in the Bronx and the department's highest-ranking woman officer, would be moved to a planning job at police headquarters. They said John Scanlon, the chief of patrol, would be shifted to chief of the transit bureau, a less prestigious position. But last night, Chief Scanlon, 60, called the commissioner to say that he planned to retire.</p>

        <p>Moving quickly to shake up the leadership of the Police Department, Bernard B. Kerik, the new commissioner, announced yesterday that he was removing the assistant chief in the Bronx, where there has been a rise in murders, and the chief of uniformed officers.</p>
        <p>Police officials said Joanne Jaffe, the assistant chief in the Bronx and the department's highest-ranking woman officer, would be moved to a planning job at police headquarters. They said John Scanlon, the chief of patrol, would be shifted to chief of the transit bureau, a less prestigious position. But last night, Chief Scanlon, 60, called the commissioner to say that he planned to retire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik made the move just two weeks after he assumed leadership of the department. When he was named commissioner, Mr. Kerik said that he would move forcefully to improve the department's leadership, especially in areas where he believed it had been weak. The transfers were among 30 changes in senior managers announced last night.</p>
        <p>Chief Jaffe had been the borough commander in the Bronx since mid-1998, and she was seen as a rising star as the number of murders declined there in 1999. But so far this year, the pace of the killings has surged by 51 percent even as the murder rate has been almost flat in the rest of the city, puzzling police officials and raising fears within the community.</p>
        <p>Chief Jaffe will be succeeded by Deputy Chief Patrick Timlin, the commander of detectives in Queens, whose work drew attention earlier this year when his officers quickly solved the mass murder of workers in the basement of a Wendy's restaurant in Flushing.</p>
        <p>Chief Scanlon, a wiry ex-Marine with a boot-camp crew cut, commanded the vast majority of the uniformed officers in the department for two years. He has been a popular leader.</p>
        <p>But he was also in command in two instances when police tactics received considerable criticism. In one case, officers were accused of overreacting at a 1998 Harlem youth rally, originally labeled the Million Youth March, when they stormed the stage after the keynote speech by Khallid Abdul Muhammad. Chief Scanlon also was in charge earlier this year when there was a series of sexual assaults in Central Park after the Puerto Rican Day parade.</p>
        <p>Police officials would not say why Chief Scanlon was transferred except to say that Commissioner Kerik wanted a new team.</p>
        <p>As Chief Scanlon's successor, the commissioner named William A. Morange, the commanding officer of the special operations division, which coordinates rescues and responds to dangerous situations.</p>
        <p>Commissioner Kerik, a former police officer, was the city's correction commissioner from 1997 until mid-August, and he gained Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's confidence through aggressive moves to bring down violence within the jails.</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon and evening, the commissioner called senior officers involved in the changes to his office, officials said.</p>
        <p>The moves came a day after Commissioner Kerik was formally sworn in in an elaborate ceremony outside City Hall, where he promised to rebuild relationships between the department and the public ''that might have been broken.''</p>
        <p>The commissioner also filled two other top jobs that had come open through retirements. Most of the other changes announced last night involved senior managers below the level of assistant chief.</p>
        <p>Among those appointed to the top jobs were George Brown, who had been chief of the transit bureau; he will succeed Martin B. O'Boyle, chief of the organized crime control bureau. James H. Lawrence Jr., an assistant chief who has been in charge of school safety, will succeed Michael A. Markman as the chief of the personnel bureau. Both Mr. Markman and Mr. O'Boyle had announced their retirements before Commissioner Kerik was appointed.</p>
        <p>Also yesterday, in a clear display of concern about the rise in Bronx homicides, Commissioner Kerik named a second commander to serve as executive officer for the Bronx; traditionally there had been just one such job. Inspector Anthony Izzo, who had been the commanding officer of the 75th Precinct in Brooklyn, will take the new position in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>There have been 145 murders in the Bronx this year, up from 96 during the same period last year, while in the city as a whole there have been 470 murders so far this year, up from 465 by this time last year. The only other borough with more murders so far this year is Staten Island, where there have been four more murders this year than during the same period in 1999.</p>
        <p>Chief Jaffe's rise to become the force's highest-ranking woman had been one of a series of milestones in her career, which began in 1979. She  has been a street officer, a narcotics investigator and a manager in the street crimes unit. She will move to a job in the department's office of management planning.</p>
        <p>Chief Scanlon also had once been Bronx borough commander, named to the job in 1996 amid concerns about another rise in murders. Just a year ago, he was considered a leading candidate to become chief of department, the top uniformed job.</p>
        <p>Chief Jaffe did not respond to messages seeking comment last night. Chief Scanlon declined to comment.</p>
