        <p>Searching within Web sites is often just as frustrating as searching the whole Web. Dead ends and unrelated links are common. But a new technology that is being unveiled this week on the Public Broadcasting Service's Web site could help change that.</p>

        <p>Searching within Web sites is often just as frustrating as searching the whole Web. Dead ends and unrelated links are common. But a new technology that is being unveiled this week on the Public Broadcasting Service's Web site could help change that.</p>
        <p>The new search technology is among the first to do a linguistic analysis of a searcher's query instead of simply relying on matching keywords with words in a document. ''You can now ask questions the way you normally do, using your own words,'' said Bruno Henry, chief executive of LexiQuest, the company that developed the search technology.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Henry said, in the past when someone typed something like, ''I want to find information on myths in American culture,'' the person was unlikely to get useful results. The words of the query were too vague and had multiple meanings. But with the new technology, Mr. Henry said, that query would be read by software trained to look for the context of the sentence.</p>
        <p>Dave Johnston, senior director of technology for PBS.org, said he expected that the new technology would help uncover ''a wealth of content that is not uncovered by the typical user.'' And it will solve another big problem, too: it will forgive misspellings of a keyword favorite: ''Antiques Roadshow.''</p>
