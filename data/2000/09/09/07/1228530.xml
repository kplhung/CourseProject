        <p>A federal judge has rejected a motion filed by lawyers for Ecuadorean Indians requesting that he withdraw from handling their seven-year-old lawsuit against Texaco Inc. The suit accuses Texaco of polluting the Indians' Amazon lands.</p>
        <p>The lawyers said the judge, Jed S. Rakoff of Manhattan, had attended an expenses-paid seminar in 1998 at which a former chairman of Texaco spoke. They said this gave the appearance of a conflict of interest.</p>

        <p>A federal judge has rejected a motion filed by lawyers for Ecuadorean Indians requesting that he withdraw from handling their seven-year-old lawsuit against Texaco Inc. The suit accuses Texaco of polluting the Indians' Amazon lands.</p>
        <p>The lawyers said the judge, Jed S. Rakoff of Manhattan, had attended an expenses-paid seminar in 1998 at which a former chairman of Texaco spoke. They said this gave the appearance of a conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>Judge Rakoff, who denied the request on Tuesday, confirmed he had attended the seminar but said the lawsuit was never discussed.</p>
