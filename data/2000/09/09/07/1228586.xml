        <p>If the presidential debates were held on the networks and days chosen by George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, they would almost surely be seen by the fewest number of people ever to have watched them.</p>
        <p>The shows and networks chosen by Mr. Bush have never reached even half as many viewers as the least-watched previous debate. That took place four years ago, when the second Clinton-Dole debate -- carried by the three major networks and CNN -- reached a total of 36.3 million viewers. The ratings were diminished by the competition from the Fox network, which that night chose to broadcast a Major League Baseball playoff game.</p>
        <p>Still, that audience represents more than twice the viewers of CNN's ''Larry King Live'' the night in 1993 when Al Gore debated Ross Perot about the North American Free Trade Agreement. That debate reached 16 million viewers, by far the most-watched night ever for the  program.</p>
        <p>It is also about nine times as many people who saw Mr. Gore debate Bill Bradley on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' last December, which reached 4.71 million viewers, the most-watched political event for that program in this election season.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has chosen those programs as substitutes for two debates set by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which would have been broadcast by all the networks.</p>
        <p>If the CNN and NBC debates take place, they would be the first in a presidential election not carried by more than one network. ABC and CBS have said they would not broadcast debates conducted as part of programs on another network.</p>
        <p>Paul Taylor, the executive director of the Alliance for Better Campaigns, a group arguing for a rise in free media time devoted to the presidential race, called the system of debates covered by every network, ''something that needs to be defended for the sake of the democracy.'' He did not fault the news organizations for proposing more debates, but said that ''jockeying by candidates is imperiling the debates that can be seen by the entire country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor questioned how a debate limited to coverage on a cable network like CNN could substitute for a debate covered by every network. ''You should not have to pay a subscription fee to have a front-row seat at democracy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It was only in the past two presidential elections that debates were not broadcast live by every major network. Contracts with Major League Baseball compelled CBS in 1992 and the Fox network in 1996 to broadcast playoff games rather than presidential debates.</p>
        <p>The result was a drop in the number of viewers for the debates. But the drop was much more significant in 1996, when ratings for the two debates that year hit a historical low. They averaged 40.6 million people, down from an average of 66 million for the three debates in 1992.</p>
        <p>In 1988, two Bush-Dukakis debates reached 65.1 million and 67.3 million viewers. The most-watched debate of all time was the only debate of the 1980 campaign, between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, which reached more than 80 million people.</p>
        <p>NBC offered to move ''Meet the Press'' to prime time Tuesday, replacing the 10 p.m. program, ''Dateline NBC.'' That program averages about 11 million viewers a week. CNN and the Fox News cable network have said they would carry the debate, as would the NBC-owned cable channels MSNBC and CNBC. But that might add only two million to three million more viewers.</p>
        <p>NBC has not committed to broadcasting the debate agreed to by CNN on Oct. 3 because it has a commitment to a baseball playoff game.</p>
