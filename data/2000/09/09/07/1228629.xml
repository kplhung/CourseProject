        <p>Lleyton Hewitt and Elena Dementieva, both born in 1981, grew up idolizing Andre Agassi and Monica Seles.</p>
        <p>But while their former heroes have already exited the United States Open, these 5-foot-11-inch teenagers are amazed to be in the semifinals, their undaunted spirit and crackling baseline play catapulting them into a future that has suddenly arrived.</p>
        <p>As they gulp back the adrenaline rush, they insist they will remain grounded. Hewitt, the 19-year-old less-famous pony-tailed Australian men's tennis player, is still a devotee of Australian rules football. Dementieva, the 18-year-old less-famous long-haired blond Russian women's tennis player, still enjoys a quiet game of chess in her spare time.</p>
        <p>She entered the tournament buying her own outfits, but she secured a sponsor between her fourth-round and quarterfinal victories.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the unseeded Dementieva advanced further than any Russian woman at the United States Open when she outlasted the 10th-seeded Anke Huber, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, in the quarterfinals. She will play Lindsay Davenport, who defeated Serena Williams, 6-4, 6-2, in the semifinals.</p>
        <p>In a breezy but efficient 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 quarterfinal, the ninth-seeded Hewitt served a personal-best 18 aces to defeat Arnaud Clement, the unseeded Frenchman who ousted Agassi in the second round. Hewitt is the youngest male semifinalist at the Open since another 19-year-old named Pete Sampras became the tournament's youngest champion in 1990. Past, present and future collide in the semifinals Saturday when Hewitt meets Sampras, who ousted Richard Krajicek last night, 4-6, 7-6 (6), 6-4, 6-2.</p>
        <p>Hewitt has dreams, but no illusions. ''I didn't come here to win it,'' said Hewitt, known for his backward baseball cap and quick-moving baseline style. ''Probably a bit stupid for me to come out and say, 'I'm going to win the tournament,' when I haven't made the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam going into this event.</p>
        <p>''That's not really realistic coming here and saying I'm going to knock off Agassi, Sampras, Krajicek and win this tournament, all these great champions who have been in that situation before. I definitely gave myself a chance of making the second week. But you know, it really has been a bonus to make it through to the semifinals now.''</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Hewitt's pony-tailed countryman, Patrick Rafter, was winning the first of his two Open titles. At the time, Hewitt was ranked No. 722 in the world. If someone had mentioned to Hewitt 18 months ago that he would make a Grand Slam semifinal at 19, he might have said, ''You're joking.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, when Lindsay Davenport was winning the Open, Dementieva watched it on television in Russia. She had turned pro two weeks earlier.</p>
        <p>Hewitt is now ranked ninth in the world, Dementieva 25th, and both are only in their second full seasons of professional tennis. Their parallel leaps have been more impressive than improbable.</p>
        <p>Hewitt began playing when he was 6, the son of two professional athletes. His mother, Sherilyn, played net ball, a combination of handball and basketball. His father, Glynn, played Australian rules football, and started his son's path toward a tennis career with lessons at a local club. Respectfully, Hewitt said he forgot in which teenage year he beat his father for the club championship.</p>
        <p>Hewitt became known for his fist-clenching and his trademark ''Come On!'' yell. He ascended the junior ranks with fiery competitiveness, motivating himself by watching ''Rocky'' movies. This year, he reached the fourth round at the Australian and French Opens, and seemed poised for a breakthrough after defeating Sampras at the Queen's Cup warm-up to Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>Sampras called Hewitt ''the best mover in the game,'' compared his quickness to Michael Chang's, and said he had ''an aura about him.'' That aura popped briefly when Jan-Michael Gambill upset Hewitt in the first round of Wimbledon and Sampras won his record 13th Grand Slam title.</p>
        <p>Hewitt knows that his only victory in four tries against Sampras came on grass and has little relevance for the hardcourt semifinal. ''It's a totally different tournament, on a totally different surface, and it's a Grand Slam,'' Hewitt said.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, that June victory boosted his confidence, along with his ranking. ''As soon as I got in the top 10, I think I really started to believe, you know, that I should be there,'' he said. ''I want to cement my spot in the top 10. This is just another step in my career.''</p>
        <p>Dementieva said she gained confidence when she defeated Venus Williams in the 1999 Fed Cup final. But yesterday, playing her first match in Arthur Ashe Stadium, Dementieva admitted to being a bit overwhelmed. She raced to a 6-1 lead against Huber, but stumbled in the second set.</p>
        <p>Even after Huber broke her to take a 2-0 lead in the third set, Dementieva recovered and played solidly from the baseline, waiting for Huber to make mistakes. Huber obliged with 44 unforced errors.</p>
        <p>''I think she has already the experience she needs to play the big matches,'' Huber said. ''Her serve is not unbelievable, but she plays smart and simple, maybe not like the other 18-year-olds who are just hitting the balls.''</p>
