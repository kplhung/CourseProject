        <p>The budget rescue plan of Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County executive, is so flimsy and lacking in detail that more work needs to be done, soon, to save the county from bankruptcy or from a takeover by a financial control board, critics of the plan said today.</p>
        <p>As county legislators from both parties criticized the sketchiness of Mr. Gulotta's proposal, one political analyst said the documents that Mr. Gulotta submitted this afternoon -- four hours late -- to back up his plan for 387 layoffs and a 4 percent tax increase in effect invited a financial control board to take over the county's fiscal management.</p>
        <p>Facing a projected deficit of $300 million over the next three years, the county received a $105 million, five-year bailout from the state this year, with the provision that it reduce its shortfall by $70 million in 2001 and 2002 and $80 million in 2003.</p>
        <p>Failing that, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, known as NIFA, which was set up by the state to help the county restructure its debt, would become a control board and manage the county's spending and taxation.</p>
        <p>''We are frustrated and deeply disappointed,'' Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the majority leader of the County Legislature, said today about a preliminary plan released on Tuesday. ''We had been waiting, working and looking forward to yesterday, expecting a 2001 budget and a four-year multiplan,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta must still present a longer-range spending plan.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs said she still had grave concerns about nearly half of Mr. Gulotta's plan to save $70 million -- $20 million in concessions Mr. Gulotta is counting on from the Nassau County Police, about $8 million from freezing bus service at last year's level, and about $6.5 million from local initiatives in mental health and social services.</p>
        <p>The interim finance authority is not ''going to accept just pie-in-the-sky figures,'' she said, citing $1 million in savings proposed through an energy management program that she said was not adequately described.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, received even harsher criticism from within his own party.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what NIFA's going to say,'' said Peter Schmitt, the County Legislature's minority leader. ''I don't think they'll be impressed with the details of the proposal, because there aren't any.''</p>
        <p>He questioned how the county could be considering giving the police a large raise, and how exactly, under Mr. Gulotta's plan, consolidating various county departments could save more than $5 million.</p>
        <p>''By merging departments, and by better use of staff, you can achieve some real savings,'' Mr. Schmitt said. ''I don't see that here. I don't see much of anything here.''</p>
        <p>He said his party remained opposed to raising taxes and continued to believe that more cuts could be made. For instance, the county executive could save $19 million, nearly enough to outweigh the tax increases, by halting union wage increases, he said.</p>
        <p>''If he stands tough, which would be a first, and stands tough with the unions, and can convince them of the seriousness of the county's problems, he can stop the clock on wage increases,'' Mr. Schmitt said.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki, questioned about Nassau's budget while in Huntington to sign legislation today, said, ''I'm disappointed that there's any need for any tax increase.''</p>
        <p>One political analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the preliminary papers released by the county executive today made it close to inevitable that the county would need outside oversight.</p>
        <p>''If anybody had any doubts that Nassau County wasn't getting a financial control board, this 17-page memorandum should provide us with a map that leads to the financial control board at the end of the day,'' the analyst said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gulotta seemed unfazed.</p>
        <p>''While everybody may not like every aspect of what is being done, I find there is a tremendous sense of relief that the issue is being dealt with in a responsible fashion, even though it may involve some very difficult decisions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Tony Giustino, president of the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents 6,000 Nassau County government workers, said those difficult decisions should not include layoffs from the union.</p>
        <p>''He should have the guts to tell people not that we may have to cut some services, but that we're going to close this park, or the sewage plant may not be properly manned,'' he said. ''He's got to think about the legacy of having a third-rate county, and then he ought to be reconsidering his draft.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giustino estimated that a $20 annual increase in property taxes per household, in addition to the $33 per household Mr. Gulotta proposed, could save the county from layoffs, which carry their own costs: termination pay, unemployment payments and increases in overtime.</p>
        <p>Throughout, there was a sense of budgetary burnout.</p>
        <p>''I'm frustrated,'' Mr. Schmitt said. ''This is not the traditional way Republicans do budgets, or do business. It's getting kind of wearisome. It has gone from strange to bizarre.''</p>
