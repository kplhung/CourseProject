        <p>Gov. George W. Bush announced a proposal on Tuesday to provide prescription drug benefits as an option under comprehensive Medicare reform. But since he does not expect such reform to happen anytime soon, he wants state governments to deal with the problem while a new White House task force works out the details of future reforms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, like Vice President Al Gore, hopes to court elderly voters with a plan to help pay for the escalating costs of drugs. But unlike Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush would not create a universal drug benefit for all retirees under Medicare. Instead he lays out a rough Medicare reform plan, with few details, that may or may not make drug coverage more accessible in the future. The Bush plan is inferior because it relies on uncertain action by states and the private sector, and would leave too many people without coverage for now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush takes a complicated two-track approach. He would first create a four-year transitional program that places the onus on states to provide drug coverage for the elderly while the federal government works on comprehensive Medicare reform. He would provide $48 billion over four years to help states pay for full drug coverage for retirees with incomes below 135 percent of the poverty line, or about $12,000 a year for an individual. Those earning up to 175 percent of the poverty level, about $15,000 a year, would get a partial subsidy.</p>
        <p>The trouble is that more than half the states currently do not provide such assistance, and many would have to create new bureaucracies to administer a new drug insurance program. State participation would be voluntary, and states would be allowed to set different premium levels and benefits. Once any retiree has spent $6,000 a year on prescription drugs, additional costs would be paid for by federal funds. Otherwise, people earning more than 175 percent of the poverty line would get no help under this interim plan. This would leave a big population unprotected, since nearly half of those without drug coverage now are middle-income people, with incomes above the cutoff for subsidies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is far less specific about how drug coverage would work in the long term, leaving the details to a task force that would be convened next year. He would not create a universal drug benefit that would be available to all the elderly at the same cost. Instead he would rely primarily on private insurers. Low-income people would be heavily subsidized, as under the Gore plan. But Mr. Bush's plan does not spell out a minimum drug benefit package or maximum premiums for middle- and higher-income retirees. Instead, government would help pay 25 percent of their drug coverage premiums.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush says he wants to spend an additional $110 billion over 10 years to modernize Medicare by having private insurance plans compete against traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Presumably, many of those plans would provide drugs as an optional benefit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush hopes that as more retirees choose these plans, fewer will be left without drug coverage. But achieving that goal is uncertain. Without a new Medicare drug program, people who stay in fee-for-service Medicare would still have to buy separate drug coverage on the private market. In that respect, the Bush plan faces the same problem as the flawed bill that passed the House in June. That plan relies on private insurers to sell prescription drug policies. Yet many insurers have said they will not be able to offer affordable policies even with a subsidy because only people with high drug expenses would buy the coverage. Mr. Gore's plan does not have this problem because his program would offer uniform drug coverage to all the elderly at $25 a month, without relying on private insurers to sell affordable policies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's reform proposal does add an interesting element to the debate. He says he would use the $6,000 cap that would initially apply to drug expenses for all out-of-pocket Medicare costs as part of long-term reform. This is a positive proposal, provided he identifies a way to pay for it.</p>
