        <p>There is one major drawback to conventional cathode ray tube monitors: as the screen size expands, so does the plastic box out back. Flatter liquid crystal displays, which take up less desk space, eliminate that problem.</p>
        <p>NEC-Mitsubishi Electronics Displays will soon begin shipping an L.C.D. monitor that, at 21.3 inches, approaches the size of the largest conventional monitors.</p>
        <p>Al Giazzon, vice president for marketing at NEC-Mitsubishi, acknowledged that there were larger flat-panel displays based on plasma display technology. But he added that although their width-to-height display, like a movie screen's ratio of about 16 to 9, may be fine for watching the latest DVD films, it falls short when it comes time to work again.</p>
        <p>That is because word processors and other software often use a display format that works better with the 4-to-3 width-to-height ratio that is the current standard for monitors. The NEC MultiSync LCD2110 maintains the 4-to-3 ratio, which allows more useful viewing area, he said.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, space-starved users may face another shortage: money. The LCD2110 sells for a staggering $7,999.</p>
        <p>Until the price drops, Mr. Giazzon said, he expects the largest group of buyers to be stock and commodity traders, whose thirst for screen space is apparently unquenchable. It is quite common, Mr. Giazzon said, for a single trader to sit in front of three or four screens.</p>
