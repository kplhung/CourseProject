        <p>Editorial endorses candidates in four Democratic contests in New York; for New York State Assembly, supports Assemblywoman Catherine Nolan in 37th District, Queens, and Raymond Jorgensen in 59th District, Staten Island; for Civil Court, supports Barbara Jaffe in First District, Manhattan, and Judge Maxine Archer in Seventh District, Brooklyn</p>

        <p>As candidates campaign vigorously before crucial primary elections next Tuesday, here are our endorsements in four Democratic contests -- two for Assembly races that have drawn increased public attention in recent days and two for Civil Court judgeships. Winning these races is usually tantamount to election.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY -- 37th District, Queens: Assemblywoman Catherine Nolan has battled hard for this district over the last 16 years, pushing for improvements in public transportation, elderly care, women's and workers' concerns and air quality. She has also become an important leader in Albany, the first woman to head the Assembly's Labor Committee. Patrick O'Malley, her challenger, has made much of Ms. Nolan's unfortunate vote to end New York City's commuter tax. But Ms. Nolan is the better choice for her experience and her record.</p>

        <p>As candidates campaign vigorously before crucial primary elections next Tuesday, here are our endorsements in four Democratic contests -- two for Assembly races that have drawn increased public attention in recent days and two for Civil Court judgeships. Winning these races is usually tantamount to election.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY -- 37th District, Queens: Assemblywoman Catherine Nolan has battled hard for this district over the last 16 years, pushing for improvements in public transportation, elderly care, women's and workers' concerns and air quality. She has also become an important leader in Albany, the first woman to head the Assembly's Labor Committee. Patrick O'Malley, her challenger, has made much of Ms. Nolan's unfortunate vote to end New York City's commuter tax. But Ms. Nolan is the better choice for her experience and her record.</p>
        <p>59th District, Staten Island: John Lavelle, the Democratic Party chairman on Staten Island, has ignited intense criticism among Democrats in this district by first promising not to run for office and then announcing for the seat, which is being vacated by Elizabeth Connelly. Mr. Lavelle's opponent is Raymond Jorgensen, a city worker, union steward and Democratic leader in the district. Mr. Lavelle offers inventive ideas, such as more public access to the water from the island's northern shore. But Mr. Jorgensen, who has a long line of union endorsements, backs a stronger campaign finance reform package for state elections, easier ballot access and smaller classes in area schools. We endorse Mr. Jorgensen for his promise to work for these and other enlightened changes in Albany.</p>
        <p>CIVIL COURT -- First District, Manhattan: The crowded field in this race comprises four candidates. They are Joan Kenney, a senior attorney in the State Supreme Court law department; Ira Cure, a private attorney specializing in labor law; Phyllis Mingione, an experienced solo practitioner and part-time counsel to the New York County clerk; and Barbara Jaffe, the author of numerous public reports on current legal issues, who is the principal law clerk to a State Supreme Court justice. The most promising choices are Ms. Mingione and Ms. Jaffe. Both have the solid legal grounding and temperament to make fine judges. But Ms. Jaffe earns our endorsement because of her legal scholarship and her impressive record of pro bono work demonstrating a commitment to improving the justice system.</p>
        <p>Seventh District, Brooklyn: During a decade as a Civil Court judge, Maxine Archer has emerged as a competent if not particularly distinguished jurist. Her affable and energetic challenger, Betty Williams, a senior hearing officer with the New York City Board of Education, was rated ''not approved,'' apparently for lack of litigation experience, by the City Bar Association. We endorse Judge Archer for another term.</p>
