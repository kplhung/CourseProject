        <p>With television cameras and photographers crowded around him, Representative Rick A.

        <p>With television cameras and photographers crowded around him, Representative Rick A. Lazio settled behind a green plastic picnic table in the Caracci family backyard here to talk up what he calls the most dramatic component of his tax cut plan: allowing taxpayers to deduct their payroll tax from their federal income taxes.</p>
        <p>''If you had an extra twelve hundred bucks, what would you do with it?'' the Suffolk County Republican asked four Rochester area taxpayers recruited by his campaign for an orchestrated conversation designed to draw attention to the tax cut that he has presented as a cornerstone of his campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>But the tax plan Mr. Lazio promoted again today was not precisely what he first proposed two weeks ago, his aides acknowledge. The aides have offered some new details on the plan since then, the effect being to lower the plan's potential cost. Those changes occurred as some of Mr. Lazio's economic assumptions were challenged by some independent analysts, and after Mrs. Clinton's aides said he underestimated the plan's price tag so he could distance himself from the $1.3 trillion tax cut proposed by George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>The payroll tax deduction that Mr. Lazio has proudly highlighted in his speeches would, in fact, be phased in over 10 years, meaning that it would be 2011 at the earliest before the four people seated at the table with Mr. Lazio today would get the $1,200 tax cut he promised. What is more, in a bit of tax policy that several independent analysts described as highly unusual and extraordinarily complicated, the tax deduction, for Social Security contributions, would only be permitted for taxpayers who, after computing their gross adjusted income, found themselves in or below the 28 percent income tax bracket. They would then proceed to subtract the additional deduction.</p>
        <p>Without those provisions, the cost of making the payroll tax deductible would be $500 billion over 10 years. With these provisions, its 10-year cost would be about $300 billion.</p>
        <p>The idea of making the payroll tax deductible has been considered, but discarded, in Congress, both because it is highly expensive and because deductions favor taxpayers in upper brackets. And in Albany, Frank J. Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a group that studies government finances, contended that Mr. Lazio's proposal, even with its upper-income limit restrictions, would still benefit wealthier taxpayers because they are statistically far more likely to itemize deductions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio made no mention of those restrictive provisions when he outlined what he described as a ''bold'' idea to the Chamber of Commerce in Amherst, N.Y., on Aug. 24, and there was no mention of it in the detailed briefing papers his campaign provided about the plan that day. ''I propose allowing people to deduct their payroll taxes on our 1040 forms -- the same way we do our state income taxes and real estate taxes,'' he said in his speech. ''This pro-family tax cut will reduce the average two-income family's tax bill by $1,200.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference afterward, Mr. Lazio described his tax plan in even more generous terms, saying that with other provisions -- including the elimination of the so-called marriage penalty, and an increase in the amounts families are allowed to contribute to IRA's -- the average family would save close to $3,000 a year. Bryan W. Flood, one of Mr. Lazio's senior advisers, said that these provisions were always part of Mr. Lazio's plan, though Mr. Flood acknowledged that the candidate did not mention them in his speech, or in appearances since then.</p>
        <p>''There was no intention to mislead,'' Mr. Flood said. 'We talked about about the fact that the payroll tax deduction plan is aimed at lower and middle-income voters. In retrospect, I guess, we could have been more clear about that. But certainly we're talking about it as a middle-class tax cut.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Flood said disputes about numbers aside, Mr. Lazio had put forward the plan as a way to draw one of the sharpest distinctions between the congressman and Mrs. Clinton: How much of the nation's surplus should be used for tax cuts.  The first lady has offered a much more modest, and less detailed, tax cut plan that adheres to the Democratic program that would provide targeted tax cuts for specific income groups.</p>
        <p>''One of the ideas of putting out an economic plan is to spark a discussion of the candidates' approach to economic issues and taxes,'' Mr. Flood said.</p>
        <p>Several elements of Mr. Lazio's tax cut plan are under fire from analysts and Democrats, who contend that their costs are significantly understated. From a political perspective, this is more than just a bookkeeping dispute because Mr. Lazio has gone to some lengths to distinguish his plan from the $1.3 trillion plan offered by Mr. Bush, putting the cost of his own plan at $776 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>For example, he put the cost of eliminating the marriage penalty at $89 billion. But analysts said that figure accounts for just the five-year cost of the tax cut: the 10-year cost is $293 billion, according to the bipartisan Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. Similarly, Mr. Lazio put the cost of repealing part of the Social Security tax at $56 billion. Mr. Flood acknowledged, though, that that figure was ''several years old'';  the joint committee's estimate is $117 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flood said that his campaign stood by its estimates, suggesting the different views were nothing more than customary disputes between Congressional Democrats and Republicans over numbers. If Mr. Lazio were to accept the Congressional figures, the cost of his plan would clearly jump over $1 trillion, complicating his efforts to distinguish himself from Mr. Bush and providing Mrs. Clinton with a clearer target.</p>
