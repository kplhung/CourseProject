        <p>Documents released today provided additional evidence that Bridgestone/Firestone and possibly Ford knew about a pattern of tire failures long before a recall was announced in August, and lawmakers began calling for tighter regulation of the auto and tire industries.</p>
        <p>The disclosures came in a long day of hearings on Capitol Hill in which Masatoshi Ono, the chairman and chief executive of Bridgestone/ Firestone, the American unit of Bridgestone of Japan, read apologies in halting English.

        <p>Documents released today provided additional evidence that Bridgestone/Firestone and possibly Ford knew about a pattern of tire failures long before a recall was announced in August, and lawmakers began calling for tighter regulation of the auto and tire industries.</p>
        <p>The disclosures came in a long day of hearings on Capitol Hill in which Masatoshi Ono, the chairman and chief executive of Bridgestone/ Firestone, the American unit of Bridgestone of Japan, read apologies in halting English. ''I come before you to apologize to you, the American people and especially to the families who have lost loved ones in these terrible rollover accidents,'' Mr. Ono told senators in the morning, squeezing in a reference to what some tire industry officials describe as an excessive tendency of Ford Explorers to roll over when they lose a tire.</p>
        <p>Republicans and Democrats alike refused to accept Firestone's apologies or each company's efforts to blame the other. Members of Congress accused both companies of having at least blithely ignored public safety, and perhaps of conspiring to do so. ''Ford and Firestone had at a minimum a moral obligation to make sure that the products they sell to the American public and other people in other countries are safe,'' said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama. ''And yet they both failed to bring this issue to consumers' and the federal government's attention, at the cost of dozens of lives, I am afraid.''</p>
        <p>The lawmakers also called for a larger budget for safety regulators and proposed federal criminal penalties for any future cases in which companies might be found to have sold products with lethal defects.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Ono's statement, Ford's chief executive, Jacques Nasser, jabbed back at Firestone later in the day, saying, ''This is a tire issue, not a vehicle issue.''</p>
        <p>But the central issue of the hearings was what did each company know and when. House investigators showed reporters a Firestone financial statement indicating that the tire maker had found a pattern of tire problems earlier than it had acknowledged. In the document, dated Jan. 19, 2000, Firestone's financial managers calculated that $1.84 million of the $2.88 million in claims in 1999 against the company for tread separation problems, or 64 percent, was for tires made at just one of its 10 North American factories.</p>
        <p>The statement identified Firestone's factory in Decatur, Ill., as making the problem tires. Previously, Firestone said it had not noticed the problems in Decatur until early August, when Ford conducted an analysis of Firestone quality data.</p>
        <p>Firestone is now recalling and replacing 6.5 million light truck tires installed mainly on Ford Explorers, including all 15-inch Wilderness tires made in Decatur for the Explorer since 1996. The Firestone data shows that the Decatur plant had its worst quality problems from 1994 through 1996, when hundreds of replacement workers were employed there during a long dispute between Firestone and its unionized workers.</p>
        <p>Before the financial statement was disclosed, Gary Crigger, Firestone's executive vice president for business planning, told a Senate panel that Firestone had immediately notified regulators in early August upon becoming aware of a problem.</p>
        <p>Representative Heather A. Wilson, Republican of New Mexico, challenged Firestone officials this evening on why their safety officials did not act if the company's financial staff was aware of a problem. ''So you looked at it from a financial point of view and not a consumer safety point of view?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crigger responded, ''I'm sorry to say that's the case.'' Firestone switched production of tires for the Explorer from Decatur to other factories last January for reasons the company has never explained.</p>
        <p>Ford also gave House investigators today a complete copy of an internal memorandum from March 1999, describing how the company handled the replacement of problem Firestone tires on Ford Explorers in Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, Congressional investigators gave reporters a copy of the memo with one section previously blacked out by Ford.</p>
        <p>That version showed that Firestone officials had been leery of sending a letter to tire owners in Saudi Arabia for fear that it might have to inform the United States Transportation Department and that it might be banned from the Saudi market. ''They feel that the U.S. D.O.T. will have to be notified of the program, since the same product is sold in the U.S.,'' the Ford memo said.</p>
        <p>But in the section of the memo that was previously blacked out by Ford, the memo's author, a Ford official named Chuck Seilnacht, mentioned that a colleague at Ford shared Firestone's worries.</p>
        <p>Corey MacGillivray, an official in the general counsel's office at Ford, ''was concerned about the implications,'' as well, the memo said. ''He was going to check with one of his colleagues to get more info.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Crigger said he had been aware of talks within Firestone's legal department of how to handle tire problems in Saudi Arabia but was not familiar with the details.</p>
        <p>Unlike Firestone, Ford sent a letter to owners of Explorers in Saudi Arabia, several months after the memo, that they should get new tires, Mr. Nasser pointed out in testimony tonight. Ford also took out advertisements to promote the tire replacement and covered the program's expense after Firestone refused to do so on the ground that the tires were failing because of customers' misuse.</p>
        <p>But Ford did not tell American regulators about the recall after Firestone officials assured the automaker that the tires did not pose a problem in the United States. Both companies still take that position: all tires replaced in Saudi Arabia were 16-inch Wilderness tires, a size that has not been recalled in the United States, though some plaintiffs' lawyers say they should be.</p>
        <p>If Ford and Firestone knew of problems and did nothing, federal regulators could impose up to $925,000 in fines. But the companies and possibly their executives could face criminal charges by state and local prosecutors, who could accuse them of culpability in deaths that occurred after the companies clearly became aware of problems, said Joan Claybrook, who was administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration under President Jimmy Carter and is now the president of Public Citizen, an advocacy group. A prosecutor in Indiana tried to charge Firestone officials with criminal negligence after the company's huge tire recall in 1978 but was unsuccessful, she said.</p>
        <p>If the public comes to perceive Ford and Firestone as culpable, that could also help plaintiffs' lawyers win larger punitive damages in lawsuits against the companies. The biggest potential damage to both companies, however, is that their images could be so sullied that customers start shying away from their products. Ford and Firestone both say that their August sales showed little effect from the recall, but some independent tire dealers say that many customers are now avoiding Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>Ford officials said today that they had repeatedly asked Firestone over the last two years to check the tires for defects and had been assured every time that any problems had resulted solely from customers' abuse of the tires. But senators and representatives were unsympathetic, saying that Ford had a responsibility to make sure that it put safe tires on vehicles.</p>
        <p>''Ford, too, when faced with hundreds of complaints of major tire defects on the Explorer, failed to respond with the sense of urgency that one would expect when the safety of so many people rested on its shoulders,'' said Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., Republican of Virginia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nasser announced tonight that Ford would set up an ''early warning'' system with the tire industry to identify tire problems as they emerge. He also said Ford would tell United States regulators of all foreign recalls.</p>
        <p>Proposals by lawmakers today emphasized harsher punishment for violators of safety rules and closer government monitoring of the auto industry, with little attention to new safety rules for tires. A few of the proposals put forward were so far-reaching that even safety activists spoke against them at the hearings.</p>
        <p>Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, proposed that the Transportation Department assign inspectors to auto factories much as the Agriculture Department assigns inspectors to chicken processors, and that automakers be required to forward their quality-control data to the government. Ms. Claybrook said that regulators did not have the staff necessary for such an ambitious undertaking.</p>
        <p>Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said that he planned to introduce legislation as soon as Thursday to establish federal criminal penalties, possibly including second-degree manslaughter, for the executives of companies that knowingly sell defective products that kill consumers. Automakers narrowly turned back a similar measure in 1966, when the nation's auto regulatory system was set up.</p>
        <p>Violations of federal auto safety rules are currently punished with a fine of the manufacturer of no more than $925,000, plus a mandatory recall of the defective vehicle, auto part or tire.</p>
        <p>Senator Shelby, who is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee for transportation, which held one of today's hearings, said he would consider an immediate increase in the budget of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department. The agency's budget was cut almost in half at the beginning of the Reagan administration and remains a third lower than it was in the Carter administration, after adjusting for inflation.</p>
        <p>For years, auto defects have received little attention on Capitol Hill. Sue Bailey, the safety agency's administrator, pointed out that it recommended on March 24 that Congress enact stiffer laws, including an increase in the limit on civil penalties to at least $1 million. No member of Congress has yet introduced a bill with these proposals, she added.</p>
        <p>The current session of Congress is scheduled to end a month from today, with only 21 more working days. Bills and budget changes introduced this late in a session usually have little chance of passage, but Senators Specter and Shelby said in interviews that Congress and the nation were so interested in the tire issue that legislative action was possible and even probable.</p>
        <p>The tire recall appears to have had fairly little effect on sales of sport utility vehicles. S.U.V. sales rose 5.1 percent in August from the level of a year earlier, while the overall auto market was flat. But all of the growth in sport utility sales occurred in small car-based models like the Chrysler PT Cruiser, which the auto industry classifies as sport utilities so as to qualify for the more lenient regulations that cover light trucks.</p>
        <p>Sales of larger models like the Ford Explorer, which tend to be based on pickup designs, fell 0.9 percent in August, partly because the Explorer, the nation's top-selling sport utility, had a drop of 0.8 percent. Sales of pickup-based sport utilities soared in the mid-1990's, but the growth has been slowing since 1997.</p>
        <p>''I see it leveling off; I don't see anything drastic happening,'' said Mark Cornelius, an auto sales analyst in West Olive, Mich.</p>
        <p>Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, said he would use the Firestone and Ford issue to seek quick passage of legislation barring companies from sealing information relevant to public safety in court settlements of lawsuits. Plaintiffs' lawyers contend that Ford and Firestone have hidden many documents with such secrecy orders.</p>
        <p>Helen O. Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for safety and environmental issues, said Ford only sealed the amounts of settlements and did not seal engineering information.</p>
        <p>Plaintiffs' lawyers said it does not appear that Bridgestone/Firestone has softened its litigation stance the last week, despite the threat of criminal prosecution in Venezuela, pressure from federal regulators to recall additional tires and blistering hearings in Congress.</p>
        <p>The heightened scrutiny ''has had no effect whatsoever,'' said Bruce R. Kaster, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Ocala, Fla., who has been a leader in suing Bridgestone/Firestone over tread separation problems. ''There's no indication of any willingness on their part to soften their position on discovery or settlements or anything else.'' Firestone is only settling cases, he said, ''when they start getting nervous.''</p>
