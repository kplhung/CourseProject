        <p>Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for United States Senate, stopped by the New Jersey State House today for what looked like an easy afternoon's work: accepting the endorsement of the state's largest environmental group, the Sierra Club.</p>
        <p>But the audience he encountered was salted with campaign workers for his Republican opponent, and Mr. Corzine ended up talking himself into an embarrassing gaffe involving his spotty record as a voter.</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Corzine arrived, campaign workers for Representative Robert D. Franks, the Republican candidate, handed out news releases, which noted that Mr. Corzine had not voted during several recent elections when open-space bond issues were on the ballot and questioned his commitment to the environment.</p>
        <p>When reporters asked Mr. Corzine about those elections, he insisted that Mr. Franks was wrong. He said he had voted in 1998 and supported Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's initiative to issue bonds to preserve a million acres of open space.</p>
        <p>But voting records at the Union County Board of Elections indicate that Mr. Corzine did not vote in 1998, and when confronted with those records several hours later, his campaign retracted his statement.</p>
        <p>''Jon misspoke,'' said Tom Shea, Mr. Corzine's spokesman. ''He didn't vote in 1998.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Corzine's memory and the 1998 open space initiative are unlikely to emerge as enduring issues this fall, the encounter offers an early glimpse of what the next nine weeks may look like. Mr. Corzine, a political newcomer who is financing his run with his $400 million fortune, is expected to rely far more on his expensive television ads than on his  wobbly performance as a public speaker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine began running television commercials on Monday and is likely to spend at least $1 million a week on ads between now and Nov. 7, Election Day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, who has raised slightly more than $1 million since the primaries ended in June, is unlikely to go on the air until sometime in October. Mr. Franks, who has held elective office for nearly 20 years, is in the improbable position of running an insurgent's campaign, scrambling for creative ways to gain free media exposure and goad Mr. Corzine into making rookie political mistakes.</p>
        <p>Already, the Franks campaign has established a Web site mocking Mr. Corzine's call for such expensive social programs as universal preschool and universal access to health care (www.mruniversal.com). Mr. Franks has been so eager for television exposure that he spent part of this afternoon filming a segment for Nickelodeon, a network created to appeal to viewers who will not be old enough to vote for a decade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks sent his campaign manager to the Corzine ceremony today, along with a spokeswoman and a campaign lawyer. They were accompanied by the chairman of the New Jersey Republican Party, Chuck Haytaian.</p>
        <p>Charlie Smith, campaign manager for Mr. Franks, was at first coy when he was asked whether he and his surrogates would dog Mr. Corzine on the campaign trail this fall.</p>
        <p>''We just wanted to see if he's the same guy who's in all the TV commercials,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But when pressed, Mr. Smith argued that it was appropriate for Mr. Franks's staff to offer instant rebuttal at Mr. Corzine's press events because Mr. Corzine had made infrequent public appearances over the summer and had not yet agreed to a schedule of televised debates.</p>
        <p>''It seems likely that every appearance, Jon Corzine will make a misstatement or misstep, and our campaign finds it important to document these and point them out to the voters,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's aides predict that such aggressive tactics could backfire. ''Jon was trying to have a civil discourse with the voters of New Jersey, and I think it's unfortunate that Bob Franks's campaign had to resort to this sophomoric attack,'' Mr. Shea said. ''All they do is attack, attack, attack. But you notice that they couldn't find any way to defend Bob Franks' environmental record.''</p>
