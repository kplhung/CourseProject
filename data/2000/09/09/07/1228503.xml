        <p>A small British magazine recently ran a cover feature on the Berlin-based female trio Chicks on Speed that didn't sit well with the band. The image on the cover was of a vivacious female model on a motorcycle with the words ''We've Got Chicks on Speed'' serving as a tag line.</p>
        <p>''Chicks on Speed is not some sleazy girl with her dress blowing off and her rear end showing on some motorcycle,'' complained Melissa Logan of Chicks on Speed in a recent telephone interview.</p>

        <p>A small British magazine recently ran a cover feature on the Berlin-based female trio Chicks on Speed that didn't sit well with the band. The image on the cover was of a vivacious female model on a motorcycle with the words ''We've Got Chicks on Speed'' serving as a tag line.</p>
        <p>''Chicks on Speed is not some sleazy girl with her dress blowing off and her rear end showing on some motorcycle,'' complained Melissa Logan of Chicks on Speed in a recent telephone interview.</p>
        <p>What Chicks on Speed is exactly is not so easy to define. Everything about the band defies convention: its music (simultaneously post-punk and post-techno), its clothes (homemade designs fashioned out of paper and leather), its members (a New Yorker, an Australian and a German), its concerts (every one is a completely different performance, with its own clothes and sets) and even the mediums it works in (graphic design, music, visual art, performance art, fashion, sales).</p>
        <p>But one thing is certain: Speed for this band is not about bikes, leather and pills. It is about productivity. Last weekend alone the band members had six art and music projects to complete, from a performance at a Communist magazine's 30th-anniversary party in Vienna to a Berlin radio interview about globalism and superheroes with a musician named Sylvesterboy, who is to release his music on Chicks on Speed Records, one of three record labels run by the band.</p>
        <p>''We say yes to everything,'' said Alex Murray-Leslie, the band's Australian third. (The band's German member is Kiki Moorse.)</p>
        <p>And they accomplish so much, Ms. Logan added, snatching the telephone from Ms. Murray-Leslie during what developed into a bizarre tag-team interview, ''because it's faster to grab something and do it right then and there.''</p>
        <p>The band also plans to open a store at the end of the month on its Web site (www.chicksonspeed.com). The merchandise will include the band's  own line of sneakers. As a comment on the competition between Adidas and Nike to be the shoes on the feet of the gold medalists at the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Chicks on Speed's own line will consist of Adidas shoes that have been turned into Nikes and Nikes turned into Adidases.</p>
        <p>The band, which not surprisingly formed in art school (the Munich School of Art), has not released an album in the United States or toured here, but it recently signed with the independent label K in Olympia, Wash. Its album ''The Rereleases of the Unreleases,'' a collage of past music, interviews and sound snippets, is scheduled for release next month. And the band hopes to begin an American tour immediately afterward.</p>
        <p>Recently the band released a mini-album in Europe on which it performed three B-52's songs. (The B-52's manager mystified the members of Chicks on Speed by referring to them as mini-Madonnas after hearing the music.) The group also released ''Will Save Us All,'' a more straightforward collection of its best-known material, like its version of the Cracker song ''Euro Trash Girl'' and ''Glamour Girl,'' a collaboration with Christopher Just, the Austrian techno producer.</p>
        <p>''We thought we wanted to make gabba,'' said Ms. Murray-Leslie, referring to the dark, high-speed techno that Mr. Just's former band Ilsa Gold once specialized in. ''So we saw him in a club and decided to ask him for help because he was the expert. Then we went to meet him in Vienna and brought text and samples, and he came up with the music.''</p>
        <p>Though the easiest reference points for Chicks on Speed are late 70's women's hybrid punk bands like the Slits, the Raincoats and Kleenex, the band is also a play on girl groups from the 60's on that haven't played instruments and have been created by male producers.</p>
        <p>''It was interesting watching what the Spice Girls were doing,'' Ms. Murray-Leslie said. ''Because everything was so plastic. You knew they had producers, but you didn't know who the producers were. We wanted to turn that inside out and say we are a produced band, but we want to look at the way the mechanism of production works.''</p>
        <p>Think of Chicks on Speed as a postmodern version of the do-it-yourself band. As Ms. Murray-Leslie put it, ''We want to do everything ourselves -- but with other people.''</p>
        <p>Generation Gap</p>
        <p>Last week Senators John McCain, the Arizona Republican, and Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who is running for vice president, announced that they would hold a hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee on Sept. 13 on marketing violence to children. The hearing will discuss the results of a recent Federal Trade Commission investigation into the marketing of explicit music, movies and video games to children.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain, an advocate of legislation to restrict the sale of violent and sexually explicit entertainment, has not released a list of the witnesses who will speak before the committee. But he has made clear that he does not want to hear from industry trade groups but from the executives of the major record labels themselves. One executive he may want to hear from is his own daughter, Sid McCain.</p>
        <p>Ms. McCain is a senior director of publicity at Capitol Records and would seem to be involved in the very practice her father is investigating. Among the rock, pop and rap groups that she represents is Megadeth, a 15-year-old heavy-metal act whose songs include ''Symphony of Destruction,'' ''Into the Lungs of Hell'' and ''Wake Up Dead.'' In a news release promoting Megadeth's latest album, she writes of the band's cross-marketing of its music into video games like ''Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,'' Jean-Claude Van Damme movies and World Wrestling Federation matches. These more or less run the gamut of violent entertainment covered in the F.T.C. investigation. Quoting Megadeth's leader, Dave Mustaine, she writes, '' 'Wrestling is aggressive,' he says, 'much like our music.' ''</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in the release, however, Ms. McCain quotes Mr. Mustaine as saying that he hopes listeners can ''apply the positivity of the music'' to their lives. ''Here's a band that seems to be misconceived to have a lot of violent lyrics, when in fact a lot of their money goes to Boys and Girls Club of America,'' Ms. McCain said. ''Dave Mustaine mentors drug addicts, and proceeds from his last tour went to the National Coalition for the Homeless.'' She added that she had a great relationship with her father, often discussed music with him and had no comment on the hearings.</p>
