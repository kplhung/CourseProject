        <p>THE No. 1 television network in viewers and advertising revenue, ABC, is reorganizing and expanding its sales and marketing efforts. The goal is to offer sponsors an easier way to buy everything from commercials during ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and ads in Disney Adventures magazine to banner ads on ESPN.com and spots on a giant video screen perched atop the ''Good Morning America'' studio in Times Square.</p>

        <p>THE No. 1 television network in viewers and advertising revenue, ABC, is reorganizing and expanding its sales and marketing efforts. The goal is to offer sponsors an easier way to buy everything from commercials during ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and ads in Disney Adventures magazine to banner ads on ESPN.com and spots on a giant video screen perched atop the ''Good Morning America'' studio in Times Square.</p>
        <p>The refocusing of the ABC Television Network's sales operations is to be accomplished through a new unit, ABC Unlimited, intended to integrate and coordinate the purchase of commercial time and ad space by marketers across all units of ABC's parent, the Walt Disney Company. This includes broadcast; cable; syndicated and local TV; radio; and print and online media.</p>
        <p>The changes, detailed yesterday at a news conference at the ABC office near Lincoln Center in Manhattan, involves promotions and new appointments for five executives as well as the hiring of about 50 employees to add to a staff of about 150.</p>
        <p>Until now, the ABC sales department had been widely considered the most traditional among the broadcast networks, reflecting the meat-and-potatoes approach of its longtime previous parent, Capital Cities/ ABC. By comparison, the rival CBS, now a part of Viacom Inc., formed CBS Plus, a division with a purpose similar to that of ABC Unlimited, in November 1998. Cable companies like the Turner Broadcasting System, part of Time Warner, have also assiduously pursued sales across disparate properties.</p>
        <p>ABC is ''keeping up with the Joneses,'' said Marc Berman, media analyst for the Mediaweek.com unit of VNU USA, who covered the news conference for The Programming Insider, a daily e-mail newsletter.</p>
        <p>Divisions like ABC Unlimited, dedicated to what is known in the media industry as cross-selling, are ''something all the networks have to think about,'' Mr. Berman said, as they seek to improve their effectiveness by broadening their horizons at a time when advertisers are turning increasingly to alternatives like the Internet, promotional campaigns and cause-related marketing.</p>
        <p>The shifts at ABC, described as the results of six months of study, planning and testing, are emblematic of the attempts by established media brands to keep abreast of upstart competitors amid a rapidly changing landscape. One purpose is to wean marketers from their long-held view of broadcast network television as only a ''cpm medium'' -- that is, one to be bought on the basis of the lowest cost per thousand viewers achieved through tough, confrontational bargaining, which diminishes perceptions of its worth.</p>
        <p>Rather than sell ''the same way we've done it for many, many years,'' said Alex Wallau, who became president of the network in June after 25 years at ABC, the idea was to foster ''more productive relationships and partnerships'' with marketers and agencies by making ABC Unlimited ''the point of entry for the entire range of media assets of the Disney company.''</p>
        <p>''This is a huge allocation of people and resources to something at the heart of what we do,'' he added.</p>
        <p>ABC Unlimited will be headed by Mike Shaw, who becomes president for sales and marketing at the ABC Television Network. He succeeds Marvin Goldsmith, a longtime network executive being named to a new post, executive vice president at the ABC Broadcast Group, consulting on sales strategies.</p>
        <p>''Going to advertisers with an integrated marketing approach really is the key,'' said Mr. Shaw, 46, who is being promoted from executive vice president and national sales manager, the No. 2 post in the department behind Mr. Goldsmith, 59. Mr. Shaw will report to Mr. Wallau.</p>
        <p>''We want to sit down with advertisers at the beginning of the process and find out their marketing objectives,'' then determine how our various assets can respond to those needs,'' Mr. Shaw said. ''This is a long-term way of doing business.''</p>
        <p>In the last year under Mr. Goldsmith, ABC became the highest-rated TV network as a result of the runaway success of ''Millionaire'' and broke revenue records with the telecasts of the Super Bowl in January and the Academy Awards in March.</p>
        <p>In the so-called upfront market in June, when commercial time is sold ahead of the annual TV season, ABC set another record by selling about $2.4 billion worth of spots to run in the 2000-2001 season.</p>
        <p>The ABC sales executives are ''at the top of their game,'' said Joe Mandese, who attended the news conference in his capacity as editor of The Myers Report, a media industry newsletter, so it ''is very symbolic they're moving in this direction.''</p>
        <p>''All the networks are talking about wanting to get a bigger share of the budgets'' of major marketers, he added. ''It will be interesting to see how this plays out.''</p>
        <p>Also involved in the reorganization is Laura Nathanson, 42, who is being promoted to executive vice president and national sales manager from executive vice president for prime-time sales. That broadens her purview to include other aspects of the broadcast schedule like daytime, news and children's programming.</p>
        <p>Bill Bund, 46, is being named to the new post of senior vice president for integrated sales. He had been manager for sports sales for the Central and Western division of ABC Sports, which recently underwent a similar reorganization of its ad sales operations, now handled by a new unit called ESPN ABC Sports Customer Marketing and Sales.</p>
        <p>And Dan Longest, 35, is being named to the new post of senior vice president for integrated marketing and promotion, reporting to Mr. Shaw. Previously, the network marketing department had reported to Mr. Wallau. That is intended to foster closer cooperation between the sales and promotion functions.</p>
        <p>One ''danger'' ABC Unlimited will try avoiding, Mr. Wallau said, is to succumb to the pressure to lower prices typically exerted by advertisers buying time and space across various properties of a media giant.</p>
        <p>''We have to make them understand and appreciate the value of what we're doing,'' he added. ''If we can demonstrate value, we will get money for that value.''</p>
