        <p>Somewhere in the background of the hype, standing well out of the swirl of attention, the unassuming Lindsay Davenport and the mischief-making Martina Hingis were feeling a little Williams-sister fatigue recently.</p>
        <p>For the past year, the focus has been on the charismatic sisters with the colorful style, public appeal and two Grand Slam titles that, at some point, went through Davenport and Hingis. So there was an innocent conversation recently, and a little joke between the two women hidden behind Venus and Serena Williams. One of them had to crash the party.</p>
        <p>''It started last year, because I played the first semifinal against Serena,'' said Davenport, referring to last year's United States Open. ''Martina played Venus. She's like, 'Well, you better win.' So I lost. I saw her in the locker room. She was shaking her head at me right before she played. Obviously, she won. This time she said, 'You're first again.' ''</p>
        <p>This time, it was Davenport who was able to creep into the airtight confidence of Serena Williams with unsettling blasts of patience. By repeatedly pounding her ground strokes into the same corners of the court, by luring Williams into gimmick shots as a way to end the point, Davenport decoded her opponent's hold on her with a 6-4, 6-2 quarterfinal victory inside a chilly Arthur Ashe Stadium. Suddenly, the end came to Williams's chance to repeat as the United States Open champion. Abruptly, the all-Williams final many envisioned was in pieces.</p>
        <p>''That's the way a lot of people want it,'' Serena Williams said after her loss. ''I'm sure a lot of people never want to see an all-Williams final. It's going to happen in the future, inevitably. Nobody's going to be able to stop it. Unfortunately, I didn't pull my end up this year. I'm sure in the next Grand Slam I'm going to do my utmost to make sure it happens.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, no one would want to see an all-Williams final because everyone doesn't really like us.''</p>
        <p>There has been tension in the locker room between the Williams sisters and some of the other players on the women's Tour. Some see them as polite, but aloof or arrogant. Some also view the sisters as a threat to take over the Grand Slam events.</p>
        <p>But Davenport proved last night that she wouldn't be intimidated. Although she had lost to Serena Williams in their last five meetings, Davenport didn't flinch. As a result, she will meet the unseeded Elena Dementieva in the semifinals tomorrow. The other semifinal will feature Venus Williams against Hingis. Then, it will be Hingis's turn to see if she can pull off a victory over a Williams sister. No doubt, Davenport will be in Hingis's corner.</p>
        <p>''We get along well,'' Davenport said of Hingis. ''She sides with me against them. She's fun to joke with. Venus doesn't talk to me much.''</p>
        <p>The silence will probably grow after last night's outcome. Davenport was unshakable in her game plan against Serena Williams. Davenport knew what she had to do. One short ball or mis-hit, one passive second serve or ill-conceived drop shot, and Williams could devour it.</p>
        <p>After all, Williams was the one who covered the court with the speed of ricochet while Davenport has more of jellyfish-like languor to her movement.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to get every ball, but if I try my hardest, and physically I'm a hundred percent, I'm not the slowest thing out there,'' Davenport said.</p>
        <p>At first, Davenport was vulnerable to the differences in quickness. A confident Williams scampered toward every driving ground stroke by Davenport and turned sure winners into amazing gets. A steady Williams was also putting in her crushing first serve at 78 percent.</p>
        <p>For a brief moment, Davenport looked overwhelmed, acting as if she just wanted to stay in the point instead of dictating it. In the second game of the match, Davenport had to fight off three break points just to keep on serve. Williams had her chances, but foreshadowed just how impatient she would become in this match.</p>
        <p>On her first break point, Williams tried to end a rally by pulling out a backhand drop shot. After Williams whacked an over-the-shoulder overhead well out, Davenport exhaled after holding at 2-1.</p>
        <p>The threat was over, and the momentum turned. Suddenly, Williams became overeager, and began whipping forehands 2 feet beyond the baseline.</p>
        <p>She also started a stream of desperate spinners and drop shots until she found herself handing Davenport her first and only break point of the first set in the ninth game.</p>
        <p>That was all Davenport needed. She served out the set. Williams never recovered. In the end, she could only hold Davenport off for so long. By yelping as she took swipes at the ball, Williams saved five match points in a thrilling seventh game of the second set that contained every theatrical version of a point.</p>
        <p>There was Williams, flicking her wrist like a short-order cook, cracking strokes with great angles only to see Davenport answer by putting balls into the corner of the court.</p>
        <p>''The difference was, Lindsay just played better than I did,'' Williams said. ''You can't afford to be on anything but your best game in the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam.''</p>
