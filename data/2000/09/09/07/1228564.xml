        <p>In the past week, he was upstaged by a nun who earned a standing ovation at the kickoff luncheon. He has offered acts of contrition, as well as faith, about his ability to coach and recruit. He uncharacteristically pumped his arms in the air asking for more celebration after a season-opening victory. He has ignored the names rocketing through cyberspace and landing in newspapers about his possible replacement.</p>
        <p>Now, Nebraska, the No. 1 team in the nation, looms for Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie, and he is doing a remarkable job of looking comfortable in the most precarious position in college football. After a 24-10 victory over Texas A&amp;M here last Saturday and a return to the Associated Press poll at No. 23, Davie knows his role heading into the Fighting Irish's most difficult game in a pivotal season: embattled coach.</p>
        <p>''If we would have lost last weekend, this golf cart would have been covered in camouflage,'' Davie said with a wry smile as he motored out to the practice field today.</p>
        <p>He does not want anyone to feel sorry for him. He is not relying on Irish mystique -- a nation-topping eight victories over No. 1 teams over the last 64 years -- as Notre Dame heads into its game with the Cornhuskers here on Saturday. The outcome, he insists, will be decided by preparation. And he wants is to win, not save his job.</p>
        <p>''What a great opportunity: here is the embattled coach and if he can win this game what a great. . . .,'' Davie said, before abruptly halting the storybook tale. ''That's all just talk. It's great conversation, but it comes down to the preparation to go play this game.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Davie says he does not believe his job is in jeopardy, and he dismisses talk that Tom Coughlin of the Jacksonville Jaguars or Butch Davis of the University of Miami will lead the Irish next year. Still, after a 5-7 season last year and a 22-16 overall record early in his fourth year, Davie has tried to confront alumni criticism.</p>
        <p>In front of 2,000 people at the kickoff luncheon last Friday, he acknowledged that coaching communication breakdowns were responsible for some of the 1999 losses. He did not talk specifics, but in consecutive losses at Michigan and Purdue last year the clock ran out as the Fighting Irish were about to push through for what would have been the winning score.</p>
        <p>''I'm not proud of everything we've done,'' Davie said today. ''I'm trying to be honest. I've always prided myself on telling it like it is.''</p>
        <p>He also addressed the perception that Notre Dame is not getting the best talent in the nation. The Irish have not had a consensus all-American since 1993, and there have been only two first-round National Football League draft picks since 1995. In 1994, when Davie was the defensive coordinator for Lou Holtz, 10 players were drafted.</p>
        <p>''I know talent is a touchy issue; it's sensitive,'' he told the luncheon crowd. ''But I believe we have as many good football players and as much depth as we've had in some time.''</p>
        <p>''It's true we can't get some other players other top programs can,'' he said. ''But it's also true that there are plenty of good, talented kids out there for us. I think we have laid the foundation of a very good team.''</p>
        <p>How long Davie will be able to build on that could be up to the new athletic director, Kevin White. White shared an on-field hug with Davie after the Texas A&amp;M victory but says only that the coach will be evaluated at season's end.</p>
        <p>''We're focused on the moment,'' White said. ''Bob Davie is our football coach. Let's not be naive; this sort of talk is part of college football and college athletics. But I'm more concerned about the potential negative impact these kind of inquiries have on our team.''</p>
        <p>Notre Dame players say they admire the way Davie has handled the uproar. Defensive end Anthony Weaver says it has never intruded into the locker room or on the practice field. ''Everything I know I have read in the paper,'' Weaver said. ''I see when he's asked about it he handles it straight on and with grace. We don't need to win for him. We need to win for us.''</p>
        <p>Davie and the Fighting Irish really have to win for a large and devoted constituency, as Sister Patrica Jean Garver demonstrated. She is 74, a retired teacher, a member of the Sisters of the Holy Cross and as ardent a Notre Dame fan as they come. She met Davie when he went to her convent for a speaking engagement. She asked if she could address his team; he said yes.</p>
        <p>At the luncheon, the coach hailed her stirring words to his team and asked her to stand and be recognized.</p>
        <p>Sister Patrica Jean, though, headed straight for the microphone. She recounted her talk to the team, how she had been a friend of the former all-American Alan Page, how Holy Cross sisters from South Bend to Bangladesh listen to Notre Dame games each Saturday afternoon, how she thought they were champions.</p>
        <p>It was an impossible act to follow, though Davie tried. Embattled or not, before sliding off the golf cart to start practice today, Davie smiled at that uniquely Notre Dame moment.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't trade what I'm doing for anything in the world,'' he said. ''It isn't as tough as people think.''</p>
