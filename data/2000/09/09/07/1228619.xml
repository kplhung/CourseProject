        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I appreciated ''Long-Distance Romance, Web-Enabled'' (Aug. 31), about relationships carried on with the help of e-mail and Webcams, because I carried on a Web-based romance with a girlfriend in 1998-99. My favorite (mis)adventure from that concerns Yahoo's Instant Messenger. If an Instant Messenger buddy logs on while you are logged on, a knocking noise is heard. My girlfriend had a high-speed Ethernet connection through a college and was constantly logged on, while I, stuck with a mere dial-up connection, frequently logged on and off.</p>

        <p>When we spoke over the Internet one night, my girlfriend turned up the volume on her computer speakers. They were still turned up and the computer turned on when I logged on the next morning -- but it was 4 a.m. where my girlfriend was. She was awakened by what sounded like loud knocking at her door. After wandering up and down the halls of her dormitory, trying to figure out who was the phantom knocker, she returned to her room, bewildered. Then she found the latest batch of instant messages waiting for her on her computer screen and figured it out.</p>
