        <p>It looked at first like a botched robbery: the owner of a Chinese takeout restaurant making a food delivery was lured late Friday night to a dark dead-end street in Queens, where he was jumped and bludgeoned to death. The killers left him with $600.</p>
        <p>But investigators said yesterday that the real motive was heartbreakingly mundane: he had been killed by a group of teenagers who wanted a free meal.</p>
        <p>Five teenagers were under arrest yesterday and were arraigned last night. They had no criminal records and were mostly from solidly middle-class families. Prosecutors said they were hungry and wanted to eat without paying, so they used a cell phone to call in their $60 order --  General Tso's chicken, shrimp egg foo yong, chicken with broccoli and shrimp lo mein -- to a vacant house on 176th Street in Springfield Gardens, Queens.</p>
        <p>When the restaurant owner, Jin-Sheng Liu, 44, arrived shortly before midnight, he was jumped from behind, covered with a bedsheet and pummeled to death with repeated head blows from fists and at least one brick.</p>
        <p>As police officers converged on the scene, the group -- four boys and a girl, none older than 17 -- fled with a bag of food to one of the boys' homes to eat, officials said.</p>
        <p>In a matter of days, the police, who cracked the case by tracing the call to the restaurant on the cell phone,  began zeroing in on a group of teenagers who lived in the neighborhood around the vacant house at 130-19 176th Street. The youngest, a skinny 14-year-old karate enthusiast named Robert Savage, was arrested Tuesday as he was riding his bicycle outside his parents' neatly kept home on 130th Avenue.</p>
        <p>Based on statements from the teenagers, investigators say they believe it was Mr. Savage who struck the most serious blows, smashing the skull of Mr. Liu with a brick. Mr. Liu, the owner of the Golden Wok at 192-15 Linden Boulevard in St. Albans, Queens, was dead at the scene.</p>
        <p>Robert Eilam, 20, who lives across the street from Mr. Savage, said that on Tuesday afternoon, a few hours before Mr. Savage was arrested, the boy had started to cry for no apparent reason. ''He was just acting as if he were so sorry about something,'' Mr. Eilam said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Savage and the other teenagers are being prosecuted as adults. Each faces multiple charges of second-degree murder, robbery and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Liu was a hard-working immigrant who leaves behind a wife and two children,'' said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. ''He was killed without provocation and without reason. It was a shocking crime, which leaves us all shaking our heads and wondering why these kids would do what they did.''</p>
        <p>The authorities identified the other teenagers as James Stone, 16, of 176-31 130th Avenue; Jamel Murphy, 17, of 219-05 131st Avenue; Darryl Tyson, 17, of 132-07 178th Street, all of Springfield Gardens; and Stacy Royster, 17, of 257-52 148th Drive in Rosedale. Because of his age, Mr. Savage faces a maximum sentence of nine years to life in prison, prosecutors said. The other four face up to 25 years to life.</p>
        <p>The teenagers were arraigned last night and ordered held without bail.  Later, their lawyers told reporters that detectives obtained statements improperly, and they disputed the authorities' account of the attack.</p>
        <p>Most notably, Mr. Savage's lawyer, Rudy Hirschheimer, disputed the prosecution's contention that his client had acknowledged striking Mr. Liu with a brick. ''My client said he didn't hit anyone with a brick,'' he said, joining with other defense lawyers in suggesting that a sixth teenage boy may have been involved.</p>
        <p>Neville Reed, a lawyer for Mr. Tyson, said that police officers repeatedly assured Mr. Tyson's parents that their son did not need a lawyer during questioning. ''The so-called statement they obtained from my client was in my opinion in violation of his constitutional rights to have counsel,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Relatives of Mr. Savage, Mr. Stone and Mr. Tyson either would not comment or did not respond to messages.</p>
        <p>A man who would not give his name but identified himself as the father of Jamel Murphy trembled  during a brief interview yesterday in front of his house. ''I really don't have any words to describe how I feel right now,'' he said. He said he would not attend the arraignment of his son, who is known to his friends as Trigger. ''For me to go and show support for something I don't support would be hypocritical.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Royster's grandmother, Anastasia Brown, said in an interview yesterday that her granddaughter had struggled in recent years with mental illness that at times made her ''aggressive and out of control.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown, who raised Ms. Royster after the girl's mother died about eight years ago, said that in recent months Ms. Royster had seemed to get her life back on track. Only last week, Ms. Brown said, she signed up for classes at Queensborough Community College.</p>
        <p>Investigators described Mr. Liu's death as the senseless outcome of an amateurish scheme. The group had already eaten once on Friday from another Chinese restaurant, but they decided they wanted seconds. Only this time, they came up with a plan to avoid paying, investigators said.</p>
        <p>The idea, officials said the teenagers told the police, was for Ms. Royster to place an order at the Golden Wok with her cell phone. Then, investigators said, Ms. Royster was to wait on the front steps of the vacant house. The teenagers later told investigators that they chose Ms. Royster because they figured that she would be perceived as less of a threat, the officials said.</p>
        <p>When the deliveryman arrived, the boys were supposed to jump out of nearby bushes, cover him with the sheet and then flee with the food, investigators said. But they also were armed with a couple of bricks taken from one of their homes. They told investigators that they intended to throw the bricks if he struggled.</p>
        <p>According to the authorities, the scheme unfolded as planned about 11 p.m. on Friday when Ms. Royster called the Golden Wok. Ms. Royster barely knew most of the boys. She had become involved with the group through her friendship with Mr. Tyson, whom she had known from the 11th grade at Christ the King High School in Queens. She keeps a photograph of Mr. Tyson by her bedroom mirror, not far from her posters of Snoop Doggy Dog and Mariah Carey and her collection of stuffed animals.</p>
        <p>''You couldn't find a nicer guy,'' Ms. Brown said of Mr. Tyson.</p>
        <p>According to Ms. Brown, her granddaughter had been at home much of Friday, listening to CD's -- hip hop and Spanish music -- writing e-mail messages, watching television. About 5 p.m. she told her grandmother she was going over to Mr. Tyson's house, in Springfield Gardens several miles away, and said she would not be out late.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown said that about 9 p.m., she beeped her granddaughter, who called her back on the cell phone Ms. Brown had bought for her a few months ago. Ms. Brown said she told her not to stay out late, but Ms.  Royster did not come home until about 2 a.m., and she was agitated and nervous, staying up until 3:30 a.m. and acting ''hyper.''</p>
        <p>By then, Mr. Liu was already dead. Plans for a simple robbery of food had spiraled out of control, investigators said, when Robert Savage used one of the bricks to begin hitting Mr. Liu. An autopsy found that he had been struck in the skull at least three times, and pieces of brick were recovered at the scene.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liu had operated the Golden Wok for at least 10 years. It is a modest storefront operation. There are no tables for dining, and Mr. Liu, a Chinese immigrant who spoke little English, made most of the deliveries himself. He worked long days side by side with his wife, a son and a daughter, and they lived in an apartment fashioned from partitions and bunk beds at the rear of the restaurant, the former property manager for the restaurant said. Yesterday, the Golden Wok remained closed and the Liu family remained in seclusion.</p>
        <p>In the days after Mr. Liu's death, the teenagers carried on as if all were normal. They went to a nearby mall. Mr. Savage showed off a new melody he had composed on his keyboard. On Tuesday, Ms. Royster went to her first day of classes at Queensborough, and while she was at the college a detective showed up at the house with questions about the cell phone call to the restaurant.</p>
        <p>Ms. Royster had told her grandmother over the weekend that she had lost the phone, but when confronted, she quickly admitted to calling the restaurant and then described the attack, Ms. Brown said. Several people who live in the neighborhood said Ms. Royster was seen riding in an unmarked police car pointing out some of the boys.</p>
        <p>''Stacy had nothing to do with that man being killed,'' Ms. Brown said, beginning to cry.</p>
