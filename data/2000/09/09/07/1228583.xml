        <p>Gore Says Prosperity Will Fuel Economic Goals  President Al Gore offered his economic vision for the future, a book-length plan that hinged on optimistic fiscal forecasts and offered a mountain of detail. He said the 10 economic goals he outlined were attainable, given the nation's current prosperity, including cutting poverty below 10 percent, raising the level of home ownership and creating 10 million new high-technology jobs.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Several Teamsters officials said the executive board would vote today to endorse Mr. Gore, despite the union's often-expressed anger at his support for the China trade bill.
