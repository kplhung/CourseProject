        <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations has released a report warning that despite a level of economic recovery, globalization threatens the region's competitiveness as an exporter and a place to invest.</p>
        <p>''All over the world, continent-sized economies, regional free trade areas and other forms of economic partnership mount a serious challenge to Asean in the global competition for markets and investments,'' said the report, written by the regional group's general secretary, Rodolfo C.

        <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations has released a report warning that despite a level of economic recovery, globalization threatens the region's competitiveness as an exporter and a place to invest.</p>
        <p>''All over the world, continent-sized economies, regional free trade areas and other forms of economic partnership mount a serious challenge to Asean in the global competition for markets and investments,'' said the report, written by the regional group's general secretary, Rodolfo C. Severino of the Philippines.</p>
        <p>The report is usually released after an annual meeting in July of Asean foreign ministers, but a spokesman for the association said it was withheld this year by mistake.</p>
        <p>The released report omits references to doubts about governments' commitment to economic reform, which were included in earlier versions leaked to local reporters.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the report is certain to provide grist in the debate about the effects of globalization. As world leaders meet at the United Nations this week to discuss globalization, economists and financial authorities in Southeast Asia are contemplating how the increasingly borderless world of commerce and information is somehow marginalizing once-envied tiger economies.</p>
        <p>Despite an uneven recovery from the financial crisis that began in 1997, most Southeast Asian economies, while still growing, have slipped behind in opening markets and competing globally.</p>
        <p>Political instability, sluggish efforts to mobilize private capital and inadequate progress in high technology are combining with increased competition from outside the region to reduce Southeast Asia's ability to meet the aspirations of a generation of young job seekers raised on Hollywood and MTV.</p>
        <p>As the demands for change from this up-and-coming generation collide with vested interests, ''there is potential for serious political turmoil,'' said William C. Belchere, head of fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch here in Singapore.</p>
        <p>On the surface, Southeast Asia's vital signs look good. Economic growth is slowing but is on track toward a 7 percent gain this year, according to J. P. Morgan. Exports remain strong, with the region a major source of computer and telecommunications hardware.</p>
        <p>But the report from Asean -- which groups together Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- points up several worrisome trends.</p>
        <p>First is a dwindling share of exports to the United States, the world's largest economy. Though Southeast Asian exports have steadily risen, United States imports from China and from Mexico are rising more quickly. In the meantime, foreign investment in Asean nations has been shifting to other developing countries, according to the report.</p>
        <p>''If Southeast Asia doesn't work harder, you could see some deindustrialization,'' said Tan Kong Nam, who heads the department of business policy at the National University of Singapore.</p>
        <p>Economists like Professor Tan warn that Southeast Asia is caught in a difficult transition between an older model of Japanese-style, state-guided economic growth and a new and unproven model based on free movements of capital and labor. Under the old model, foreign and especially Japanese investment played a crucial role -- along with huge public bank deposits -- in helping governments build export industries.</p>
        <p>That investment reached a peak in 1996, resulting in industrial overcapacity, a collapse in asset prices and a debt burden that still hobbles the region's banks and curtails its ability to finance the transition to the new economy, Professor Tan said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Asean report finds a ''stark'' digital divide between Southeast Asia and some other economies, offering statistics showing, among other things, that the Chinese are more than twice as likely to use the Internet as Southeast Asians.</p>
        <p>The size of this region's market for electronic commerce indicates a similar kind of disparity. Though growing rapidly, Southeast Asia has made only one-tenth the transition toward the new economy that the United States has, according to figures from the International Data Corporation.</p>
        <p>Asia lacks much of the physical infrastructure required for electronic commerce to take off. Attitudes also play a big part, technology executives say, since transactions conducted over networks have a kind of transparency that is anathema to the cozy relationships and under-the-table deals that have long characterized business in the region.</p>
        <p>Analysts and investors say Southeast Asia's diversity also hinders the development of a new economy. The region, with a market of nearly 800 million people, is divided by nationality, culture, language and regulations, with no one market of Internet users, that can compare with the likes of China or even Latin America. ''It makes it tougher for these companies to develop,'' said Dane Anderson, vice president for Internet research at International Data in Singapore.</p>
