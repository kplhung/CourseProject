        <p>Religious Visions</p>
        <p>Throughout his career, which spanned the Gothic, Renaissance and Reformation eras, the great German artist Albrecht Durer (1471-1528) was preoccupied with the Passion.

Beginning on Saturday, an exhibition at the Busch-Reisinger Museum of the Harvard University Art Museums in Cambridge, Mass., will display each series side by side. Encompassing nearly 100 works, ''Durer's Passions,'' through Dec. 3, is assembled from Harvard's collections and those of the British Museum; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and institutions in Frankfurt, Berlin and Bremen, Germany.</p>

The exhibition, ''Unseen Treasures: Imperial Russia and the New World,'' continues through Dec. 31.</p>
