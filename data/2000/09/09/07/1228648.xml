        <p>Correction of Sept 2 article on finances of Dick Cheney, Republican candidate for vice president, and his wife, Lynne's, membership on corporate board</p>
      </abstract>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Saturday about the finances of Dick Cheney, the Republican candidate for vice president, misstated his reason for having rejected $89,500 in honorariums from 1992 to 1999 and having directed them to charity. The action was voluntary, not required.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the relationship of Mr. Cheney's wife, Lynne, to the board of Union Pacific Resources. She was a board member until the company was taken over this year by the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, an independent oil and gas exploration company. She is not now a member.</p>
