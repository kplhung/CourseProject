        <p>Robert Gottlieb, one of the most powerful agents in book publishing, resigned as head of the William Morris agency's New York literary group to start his own agency and multimedia management company, a blow to the venerable William Morris's presence in the book business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gottlieb's jump is also a sign of the strains on agents' traditional roles as more agents and managers seek to participate in lucrative deals to produce their clients work for other media like film and television. In fact, by opening the possibility of producing projects based on his clients' work, Mr. Gottlieb is apparently reversing his own recent disparaging statements that such managers were ''neither fish nor fowl,'' creating a potential conflict of interest by representing authors in negotiating some contracts while sitting across the table from their clients to sign deals for other media.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gottlieb, 46 years old, began his career at William Morris 24 years ago in the mail room and now represents a roster of blockbuster writers including Dean Koontz, Deepak Chopra, Elizabeth George, Catherine Coulter and Janet Evanovich.</p>
        <p>In recent months, Mr. Gottlieb clashed with James A. Wiatt, the former vice chairman of International Creative Management who took over last year as president and co-chief executive of William Morris, but both sides said yesterday that Mr. Gottlieb's departure was unrelated to their personal relationship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gottlieb's move had been in the works for at least eight months according to people involved, and his new company, the Trident Media Group, has already furnished and occupied its office on Madison Avenue.</p>
        <p>''For some time, I have been planning on starting an agency that is not simply devoted to selling rights or selling authors' manuscripts but really is a business founded on an understanding of the world of intellectual property rights, branding and managing across a variety of platforms,'' Mr. Gottlieb said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gottlieb said his new company would represent clients in film, television, Internet and museum exhibition deals as well as books. The new firm will receive a commission on some deals it negotiates but may participate as producer and partner on other deals, he said. ''That is part of the entrepreneurial proposition,'' he said, ''There are no closed doors, no borders.'' Mr. Gottlieb said that his clients would be represented by outside lawyers or agents when they negotiated deals with his firm.</p>
        <p>After his longtime client Tom Clancy recently dropped William Morris in favor of Michael Ovitz's new talent management firm, Mr. Gottlieb criticized Mr. Ovitz for blurring the lines between agent and manager or producer. ''I think this is different,'' Mr. Gottlieb said. ''I am going to embrace agents, managers and laywers. I have no intention of taking clients away from agents.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gottlieb will take with him three former William Morris staff members and, he said, the more than 40 clients on his roster had agreed to follow him.</p>
        <p>His resignation leaves a substantial vacuum in the William Morris agency's literary group. The firm will retain commissions from all of the contracts Mr. Gottlieb negotiated while at the firm, some of which extend for several books yet to be written. But his departure leaves William Morris without another agent of Mr. Gottlieb's stature. Among its biggest agents are Owen Laster, head of its worldwide literary group, and Joni Evans, former publisher of the Random House adult trade division, who joined William Morris seven years ago but has not established a client list nearly comparable to Mr. Gottlieb's.</p>
        <p>Losing Mr. Gottlieb ''is a big bump,'' said Mr. Laster, 61 years old, who once employed Mr. Gottlieb as his assistant. ''We will have to do some rebuilding, I can't deny that.'' Among its best-selling remaining authors are Judy Blume, Susan Isaacs and Peggy Noonan, Mr. Laster said. William Morris, one of the largest talent agencies, retains operations in extensive film, music and television businesses.</p>
