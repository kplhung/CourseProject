        <p>A suburban Los Angeles school district has reached an agreement to recognize a group of gay students and their supporters. The decision would settle a federal lawsuit challenging the district's refusal to allow it to meet as a student club.</p>
        <p>The Orange Unified Board of Education in Orange is expected to complete the agreement on Thursday to allow the meetings at El Modena High School, which had been taking place under court order since February. The planned settlement comes after the Salt Lake City School District voted on Tuesday to end a four-year ban on noncurricular clubs that had been instituted after a gay tolerance group tried to form at a high school there. Salt Lake schools had also been sued over their ban.</p>
        <p>The Orange board approved the settlement by a 5-to-2 vote at a closed session in August. On Thursday, the board plans to adopt changes in policies involving clubs that will allow the agreement to take effect.</p>
        <p>''This settlement agreement would allow us to bring this to closure and move ahead with the business of the district, which is offering quality education to the children of Orange Unified,'' said Judy Frutig, director of communications, for the district.</p>
        <p>Commenting on the parallel decisions in Orange and Salt Lake City,  Jon W. Davidson, a supervising lawyer with the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, which represented students in both districts, said, ''I think the message of both of these districts is it's a losing battle for school districts to try and prevent students from forming the clubs they want, including gay-straight alliances.''</p>
        <p>In voting last year to deny the Gay-Straight Alliance's application to meet, the Orange board cited the state education code, which it said strictly defined how sex education and related courses were to be taught. The board maintained that it would be inappropriate for students to lead discussions on sexuality and sexual conduct.</p>
        <p>A federal lawsuit filed in behalf of the club and a student organizer, Anthony Colin, accused the district of violating the Equal Access Act, a federal law prohibiting schools from selectively denying noncurricular  clubs on the basis of content. The suit also contended that the board's denial violated students' constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection.</p>
        <p>''We have basically won, no matter what's said,'' Mr. Colin said. ''The gay and lesbian community now knows the board has made the right decision to welcome this club onto their campus. It sets a precedent for organizations all over the country, California and the rest of the nation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidson of the legal defense fund said it remained uncertain whether the change in Salt Lake City would mean that the gay-straight alliance would be allowed to meet.</p>
        <p>''The lawyers for the school district have suggested that it would,'' he said. ''However, there are a number of requirements in policy they adopted that we find troubling.''</p>
        <p>Among those were stipulations that any club can be denied authorization if it advocated or approved of sexual activity outside marriage or violated state laws regarding sex education. The policy also stipulates that the district can disapprove club names and requires parental consent for membership in clubs.</p>
        <p>John Robson, a lawyer representing the Salt Lake City School District, said he expected that the lifting of the ban on noncurricular clubs would result in a gay-straight alliance being allowed to meet.</p>
        <p>In Orange, the board stopped short of banning all noncurricular clubs in February following a preliminary injunction ordering the district to allow the Gay-Straight Alliance, which had about 50 members, to meet at El Modena High School. Instead, the board voted to restrict clubs at elementary and middle schools to those related to studies.</p>
        <p>Under the settlement announced on Tuesday, Orange Unified will continue to allow the group to meet, but will change some rules regarding non-curricular clubs. The new rules will include a restriction on discussions of sexual activities and will provide parents with an opportunity to prevent their children from participating in specified clubs.</p>
