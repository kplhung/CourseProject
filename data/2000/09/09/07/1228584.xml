        <p>Prominent Republicans around the country, including several who advise Gov. George W.

        <p>Prominent Republicans around the country, including several who advise Gov. George W. Bush, say they are worried that his candidacy has floundered in recent weeks, allowing Vice President Al Gore to build on his velocity from the Democratic convention in a way that they never expected.</p>
        <p>While none of these Republicans expressed panic and all said that Mr. Bush could reverse the trend, they acknowledged puzzlement, frustration and even some distress about the strides that Mr. Gore has made, a degree of progress that they said went beyond an inevitable tightening in polls.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt about it: There's real worry about the general state of things,'' said William J. Bennett, the former secretary of education, who has advised Mr. Bush from time to time. ''There's nervousness that was not there before.''</p>
        <p>In interviews during the past several days, leading Republicans on Capitol Hill, at state capitals and even at the Bush headquarters in Austin, Tex., raised concerns beyond poll numbers.</p>
        <p>Many of them expressed unease about the way Mr. Bush has handled himself, saying that in the last two and a half weeks there had been too many instances when he seemed either defensive, bumbling, weary, detached or peevish.</p>
        <p>And there have been too many missteps, several Republicans said. For starters, some cited Mr. Bush's refusal to go along with the debate schedule proposed by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, saying his reluctance had made him look timid and was diverting attention from issues that he would be better off discussing.</p>
        <p>Others said Mr. Bush was letting himself get dragged too deep by Mr. Gore into the bogs of a policy debate, where the vice president is at his best. Still others said that Mr. Bush's choice of Dick Cheney as a running mate had produced scant excitement on the campaign trail but significant damage in the news media, manifest in weeks of questions about the financial details of Mr. Cheney's retirement package from Halliburton, the energy services company he served as chief executive.</p>
        <p>Several Republican officials said they had serious reservations about the party's tongue-in-cheek TV commercial broadcast last week that challenged Mr. Gore's truthfulness and political consistency.</p>
        <p>Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the campaign was too preoccupied with trying to make everyone happy and not delivering a clear message.</p>
        <p>''The biggest mistake we can make is to try to be all things to all people,'' he said. ''We have to be very aggressive and not engage in any reticence about our philosophy or our positions.''</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, dismissed the worries about the state of the governor's candidacy, so dominant for most of the year.</p>
        <p>''Everybody wants to win in a landslide,'' he said. ''Landslides are rare. We've always known and said this was going to be a close race.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, to some Republicans, Mr. Bush began the process of correcting his campaign this week. On Tuesday, he moved aggressively to neutralize Mr. Gore's advantage on the critical issue of health care by releasing his own plan to give prescription drug benefits to the elderly. And Mr. Bush has engaged Mr. Gore much more forcefully in his comments and oratory.</p>
        <p>But Republicans said that the combination of Mr. Gore's surge and Mr. Bush's stumbles had made Mr. Gore, for perhaps the first time in the 2000 presidential race, the front runner.</p>
        <p>Many said they were unnerved by voter surveys showing that Mr. Gore -- who for months trailed in the polls -- had pulled even or ahead of Mr. Bush nationally and in some important states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Missouri, where campaign officials had long predicted victories.</p>
        <p>''Everybody expected a bounce, but not nearly as much as this,'' said Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, referring to Mr. Gore. And, he said, it had significantly altered the mood of Republicans in his state, a crucial battleground.</p>
        <p>''There is a lot of chatter at the grass-roots level about how they're scared of these new numbers,'' he said. ''This has shocked the system from what looked like a slam dunk.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who has campaigned with Mr. Bush in his state for the past three days, said: ''I'm at a loss to explain the rather significant change in the polling numbers.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Ridge said he was confident Mr. Bush would recover, he said, ''We've got to go a little bit more on the offensive.'' He added of Mr. Gore, ''This guy's tough.''</p>
        <p>In fact, in the nearly three weeks since the end of the Democratic convention, Mr. Gore has been constantly on the offensive. First he declared himself the candidate of the little guy and portrayed Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney as beholden to big oil and drug companies; then he relentlessly attacked Mr. Bush over tax policy and health care.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Gore has managed to use the favorable attention he received during the convention -- even the much publicized kiss he planted on his wife, Tipper, before his acceptance speech -- to give life and personality to his stiff and uninteresting stereotype.</p>
        <p>A Republican official closely involved in the Bush campaign said that Mr. Bush's aides had readjusted their expectations for a spate of new polls that are to be released in the next few days.</p>
        <p>As recently as two weeks ago, the official said, Mr. Bush's aides were forecasting that these polls would show the race in a dead heat. But there was now a feeling inside the Bush camp that Mr. Gore might have, on average, a 3-to-5-point advantage, the official said.</p>
        <p>A Washington-based adviser to the Bush campaign said: ''Today, I think anybody forced to wager on the race would have to bet on Gore.''</p>
        <p>An official of the Republican National Committee said, ''You're always on the defensive when your lead evaporates.''</p>
        <p>In the interviews, Republicans of all ideological stripes were hardly unified in dispensing advice for Mr. Bush, or in gauging the health of his candidacy. Several said that Mr. Bush was merely being buffeted by cyclical forces, which might change several times again before Election Day. Others said that Mr. Bush's position on debates made at least as much sense to voters as Mr. Gore's.</p>
        <p>But some concerns about Mr. Bush's campaign were mentioned time and again.</p>
        <p>For example, several Republicans said that Mr. Bush still needed to be more aggressive in explaining his proposal for a tax cut of $1.3 trillion over 10 years, more than double the size of the cut planned by Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''People get very worried about that kind of a tax cut with the speculative nature of the surplus,'' said Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>Mr. Specter and other Republicans said it was a mistake for the Bush campaign to sign off on a Republican Party commercial that poked fun at Mr. Gore for appearing at a Buddhist temple fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's wise to do a 'tongue-in-cheek,' '' Mr. Specter said. ''It's got to be treated very seriously and in a factual way with no apologies -- but not tongue in cheek.''</p>
        <p>Some people close to the campaign even said that Republican National Committee officials warned that the commercial was inappropriate because it moved the discourse away from issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney was also cited by many Republicans as a disappointing choice for Mr. Bush's running mate, especially compared with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who has helped energize the Democratic ticket.</p>
        <p>''He can recover, but he's not gotten off the dime,'' Mr. Upton said of Mr. Cheney. ''The focus, rather than on his solid record of achievement, particularly as the secretary of defense, and then in the private sector, has been totally eclipsed by personal finances.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennett put it this way: ''The Lieberman pick looks pretty solid. He's a happy camper out there.''</p>
        <p>Some Republicans also said that despite his proposal for debates this week, Mr. Bush was unwise to make an issue of the format for his televised encounters with Mr. Gore. ''He is proposing debates that will arguably reach fewer people,'' said a Bush adviser. ''You can't sell a Chevy and say it's a Cadillac.''</p>
        <p>In addition, several Republicans said, Mr. Bush has at times failed to muster the sunny geniality and bravado that have always been his strongest suits.</p>
        <p>He has fumbled with his mathematical figures and his words. In an interview late last week, at a time when he might be expected to be as pumped up by the gathering frenzy as ever, Mr. Bush instead grew prematurely reflective and slightly teary as he mulled over what he said was the greatness of American democracy.</p>
        <p>At a news conference on Sunday, as he showed snippets of videotape to support his accusation that Mr. Gore was backing out of an agreement to debate anytime and anywhere, he tapped his foot and occasionally pursed his lips.</p>
        <p>The next day, Mr. Bush, who prides himself on discipline, was caught uttering a vulgarity to describe a reporter into a microphone. While many political analysts said that the incident would cause no major damage, others said it could feed into perceptions of Mr. Bush as insufficiently experienced or mature for the task at hand.</p>
        <p>''He's still a relative rookie at the national level,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a government professor at the University of Texas in Austin, ''and that's showing right now.''</p>
        <p>Despite their concerns, some Republicans said that while they were sobered by the situation, they were not scared.</p>
        <p>''There was a period right before and during the Republican convention where it looked like Bush would sail away with this,'' said Senator Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois. ''We've all come back to reality.''</p>
        <p>Representative Joe Scarborough of Florida said: ''The campaign actually started yesterday in earnest. If Bush was going to have a problem, he picked the right time to have it.''</p>
        <p>Bill Paxon, a former House member who is an adviser to the campaign, said Republicans who expected Mr. Bush to be ahead now were guilty of ''Alice in Wonderland'' thinking.</p>
        <p>''I believe that it's going to be a tight race to the finish,'' he said. ''But I am as confident of victory as I was six month ago. George W. Bush is going to be the next president.''</p>
