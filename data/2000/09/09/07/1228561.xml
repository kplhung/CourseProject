        <p>The royals are coming.</p>
        <p>No, no, not the poor old British Crown Prince, still overshadowed by the tragic legacy of Diana, Princess of Wales. Nor any of his relatives, like that fellow who flies the helicopter and his former lady who does the weight-loss thing.</p>
        <p>No, New York is getting the other ones, the fabulously cool new royals: the handsome Crown Prince Philippe of Belgium and his ravishing Princess Mathilde, the fairy-tale couple that have monopolized magazine covers and glossy photo spreads throughout Europe. Their nuptials on Dec. 4 were trumpeted as the last royal wedding of the millennium.</p>
        <p>Their mission is nothing less than to take New York City by storm, winning hearts, minds, media and, more important, market share.</p>
        <p>And so, on Saturday, just when New York is once again a Millennium Summit-free zone, the prince and princess will kick off their whirlwind five-day visit. A plane full of European reporters and news crews will arrive at Kennedy International Airport with the royal delegation to cover the tour, which includes stops at the United Nations, the World Trade Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and even a supermarket.</p>
        <p>The joint visit is unprecedented, given the traditional protectiveness of the royal household. And the great to-do over the arrival is even more unusual given that the royals hail from the tiny, distant nation of Belgium, which to many New Yorkers is simply the country the waffles come from.</p>
        <p>But that stubbornly self-deprecating nation of 10 million people by the North Sea, in an area scarcely larger than New Jersey, has enjoyed an extraordinary visibility in New York City of late. The effusion of Belgianophilia includes eateries like Markt, Petite Abeille and Le Pain Quotidien, proliferating in a restaurant district in Manhattan that some call Little Belgium. Not to mention the explosion of interest in Belgian beers, chocolates, double-fried potatoes and deconstructivist fashion.</p>
        <p>Despite all this, ''Belgium is a well-kept secret that deserves to be better known by many more Americans,'' the prince said in the couple's first joint written interview.</p>
        <p>Ingeborg Kristoffersen, the Belgian consul general in New York, said the royal visit ''is a way to bring attention to the variety and quality of things Belgian.''</p>
        <p>One indication of the importance of the visit was the interview with the prince and princess, which ''is quite extraordinary,'' said Philippe Gyhsens, a royal-watching reporter for Belgium's largest newspaper, Hetlaatste Nieuws, in Brussels. ''Journalists are not allowed to ask questions of the prince or princess.'' [Excerpts are available at The New York Times on the Web: www .nytimes.com/international.]</p>
        <p>But the symbolic visit of the future monarch of Belgium is decidedly serious in a nation where the constitutional monarchy ''is the only institution holding the country together,'' said Luc Sante, the Belgian-born writer who is a visiting professor at Bard College. He referred to the disparate, oft-fussing population of Dutch-speaking Flemings and French-speaking Walloons.</p>
        <p>The ''working visit,'' as the prince termed it, is also a long-sought validation for American importers of Belgian products, who traversed a desert of indifference for decades before the current Belgian boom. The advent of the royals is nothing less than ''a culmination, coming at a very fortuitous time,'' said Don Fineberg, co-founder of Vanberg &amp; DeWulf of Cooperstown, N.Y., an importer of Belgian specialty beers.</p>
        <p>But are they attractive enough to bring off a Belgian conquest? Well, though he drives a Carrera 911 Porsche, studied at Oxford and Stanford Universities, leads trade missions and flies F-16's, Prince Philippe, the 40-year-old heir to the Belgian throne, does have his Prince Charles-ish aspects.</p>
        <p>Belgians had nearly given up on the prince, a perennial bachelor, until he stunned the nation by announcing the royal wedding from out of the blue -- after a secret three-year courtship -- last fall. He is reported to be reticent, even, well, ''dull,'' as Mr. Ghysens, the royal-watcher, put it.</p>
        <p>It is a reputation that ''I hope is unjustified,'' said the prince, adding:  ''I am not the best judge in this matter. You should ask my wife.'' Madame the princess did not touch on this point in her interview.</p>
        <p>Princess Mathilde, a friendly, radiant 27-year-old, has been dubbed the ''Queen of Hearts'' by the French magazine Paris Match. She resembles the model Claudia Schiffer and traces her aristocratic lineage to the 13th century. She is destined to become the 170-year-old country's first Belgian-born queen (royal predecessors have come from France, Italy, Spain and Sweden). So far, she can do no wrong.</p>
        <p>''Finally we have a gorgeous princess, and some glitter and glamour,''  Mr. Ghysens said. ''Now we finally have an international visiting card.''</p>
        <p>Surprising in a nation known for its reserve, she was greeted with a chant of ''Mathilde, Mathilde, Mathilde'' from thousands of Belgians during the wedding. ''It was a very private moment for the prince and me, and we were glad that we could share it with the Belgian people,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz started her own speech-therapy practice at the age of 22 in Brussels. She is  working toward a degree in psychology. Despite the royal fish bowl, the princess said, ''I intend to continue my studies, as I am doing my finals next year.'' But she acknowledged,  ''As you can imagine, it will be very difficult for me to work as a speech therapist as I did before.''</p>
        <p>For the princess, who once lived in Washington for three months, the return to America is welcome because ''I really enjoyed my stay here,'' she said. When asked if she found it difficult to define the role of princess in the year 2000, she agreed that the role was challenging, but said that ''my support of my husband is of utmost importance to me.''</p>
        <p>The high point of her activities is likely to be an attention-focusing visit to Abraham House, a seven-year-old halfway home in the South Bronx founded and run by Sister Simone Ponnet, a Belgian nun who works as a chaplain at Rikers Island.</p>
        <p>The prince and princess -- who are to be addressed ''monseigneur'' and ''madame,'' don't you know -- will attend 17 major events from Saturday until their departure on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The giddy whirl, graced on occasion by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt of Belgium, will range from a glittering dinner fund-raiser for the Belgian-American Chamber of Commerce at the Metropolitan Club to yes, a supermarket promotion: the royals will swoop down on the D'Agostino supermarket at 23rd Street and Eighth Avenue to kick off a celebration of Belgian products at 24 D'Agostino stores.</p>
        <p>There will be a Wall Street power breakfast (followed, of course, by the ringing of the bell by the prince to launch trading on the New York Stock Exchange). There will be global trade seminars and presentations for business leaders at the World Trade Center to sell the idea that Belgium is about biotechnology as well as mussels and frites.</p>
        <p>Presumably the royals will, by example, quash the base rumors that Belgian beermakers are disappointed that they don't publicly drink more of the national brew. ''I want to reassure you that both Princess Mathilde and myself are fond of Belgian beer,'' said the prince, ''and we drink it often.''</p>
        <p>Belgian living in New York will also be received at Markt, the Belgian bistro on 14th Street and Ninth Avenue. Young Belgian artists, academics and entrepreneurs will be feted at Le Pain Quotidien in SoHo.</p>
        <p>If anything, the advent of the royals in New York is viewed by some expatriates as fair Belgian retribution. ''Celebrities, the modern kings, have become one of America's most important export products,'' said Tom Ronse, an artist who is one of the metropolitan region's 8,000 Belgians.</p>
        <p>It is no exaggeration to say that the European press gushed, swooned and curtsied at the couple's picture-perfect December wedding, attended by some 45,000 Belgians and, literally, the crowned heads of Europe. A half-dozen Belgian television outlets offered as much as 15 hours of live coverage.</p>
        <p>Because they are Belgians, afterward some grumbled at the $1 million of taxpayers' money spent on the wedding for appointments that included a 1,000-person security detail, a host of motorcycle police and an F-16 fighter fly-by of the palace.</p>
        <p>But so great was the swell of national optimism that commentators said the ''Mathilde Factor'' helped to distract attention from a series of national scandals that questioned Belgians' faith in the country's policies, its judiciary and its political system, from a dioxin food scare to a pedophile-and-murder case bungled by Belgian detectives.</p>
        <p>It also caused consternation in the royal household, European journalists said, because Prince Philippe, not unlike Prince Charles, was being upstaged by his glamorous bride.</p>
        <p>Annually, Belgian taxpayers spend more than $8 million to support their monarchy, only a 10th of what the British annually pay for their royals. If the queen in England, as head of the Commonwealth and the Church of England, has more designated power, in Belgium the king appoints the new government and assumes a crucial unifying function.</p>
        <p>''If one of the royals were to favor the Flemish or the French, chaos would break out,'' said Mr. Sante, the Belgian writer who immigrated to the United States at 5 and described his life in ''The Factory of Facts'' (Pantheon Books, 1998).</p>
        <p>But the prince said there was ''a new spirit in the country,'' an improvement ''in the relations between the Flemish and the Walloons.''</p>
        <p>That new spirit could have something to do with Princess Mathilde, who is, herself, a balanced ticket. The ancestors of the princess come from Flemish-speaking Flanders to the north, but she grew up in French-speaking Wallonia to the south, and lived in bilingual Brussels.</p>
        <p>For her part, the princess is trying to tone down ''Mathildemania.'' ''Maybe I will not be able to fulfill all expectations,'' she said humbly, ''but I will surely do my utmost.''</p>
        <p>The prince's fortitude and his bride's charisma may soon be put to the test: King Albert II, Philippe's 66-year-old father, who had already undergone back surgery, had quadruple bypass heart surgery in April, giving rise to speculation that he will soon step down from the throne.</p>
        <p>So, will America fall prey to rampant Belgianism? Some expatriates are amused at the very presumption. ''Why is there this incredible fascination with royalty?'' asked Jacqueline Goossens, who lives in Stapleton, Staten Island, and files weekly reports on life in the city for two Belgian publications, De Morgen and Knack. ''I am flabbergasted that modern people in this day and age are interested in them.''</p>
