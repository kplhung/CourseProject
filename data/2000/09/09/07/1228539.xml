        <p>The Federal Trade Commission said yesterday that it was investigating whether Bristol-Myers Squibb and a small California company called American Bioscience might have illegally colluded to keep the lower-cost, generic version of Bristol's top-selling cancer drug, Taxol, off the market.</p>
        <p>The F.T.C. said in court papers filed in Federal District Court in Los Angeles that the terms of the agreement between Bristol-Myers and American Bioscience ''raise potential competitive issues,'' including questions about whether the two companies were trying to keep generic Taxol off pharmacy shelves, potentially harming consumers.

        <p>The Federal Trade Commission said yesterday that it was investigating whether Bristol-Myers Squibb and a small California company called American Bioscience might have illegally colluded to keep the lower-cost, generic version of Bristol's top-selling cancer drug, Taxol, off the market.</p>
        <p>The F.T.C. said in court papers filed in Federal District Court in Los Angeles that the terms of the agreement between Bristol-Myers and American Bioscience ''raise potential competitive issues,'' including questions about whether the two companies were trying to keep generic Taxol off pharmacy shelves, potentially harming consumers. Taxol, a drug discovered by the federal government, generated $1.5 billion in sales for Bristol-Myers last year.</p>
        <p>Generic drug companies often charge about 30 percent less than the price of a brand-name drug during the first six months that the generic drug is on the market. After the first six months, the price sometimes falls to less than 50 percent of the price charged by the brand-name drug manufacturer. Over all, generic drugs save consumers billions of dollars a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p>
        <p>The Food and Drug Administration gave Ivax, a generic drug maker based in Miami, tentative approval last month to sell generic Taxol. But while the F.D.A. said that Ivax's drug was just as effective and safe as Taxol, the regulators said they could not let Ivax sell the drug because of a complex legal agreement between Bristol-Myers and American Bioscience. Under that agreement, Bristol-Myers had listed a patent owned by American Bioscience that is related to Taxol in a publication maintained by the F.D.A, which is known as the orange book.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers said, ''Since we just learned of the investigation, it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.'' American Bioscience did not return repeated calls asking for comment on the investigation.</p>
        <p>The F.T.C.'s inquiry is part of a broader effort to stop brand-name drug companies from illegally trying to keep lower-cost generic drugs from being sold.</p>
        <p>Bristol-Myers and American Bioscience had asked Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. of the Federal District Court in Los Angeles to approve the agreement between them and to order Bristol-Myers to keep American Bioscience's patent listed with the F.D.A. Under federal law, the listing of that patent could have blocked Ivax from selling generic Taxol for as long as 30 months. Such a delay would have allowed Bristol-Myers to maintain its monopoly on Taxol, a coup that could have been worth more than $2 billion in sales.</p>
        <p>Last month, when Ivax learned of the agreement between Bristol-Myers and American Bioscience, company executives called it just ''another scheme'' to keep them from selling the lower-cost drug.</p>
        <p>But both Bristol-Myers and American Bioscience denied Ivax's accusations. American Bioscience said that it was asserting its legitimate rights to a patent granted to it by the United States Patent Office. To go ahead with development of a drug covered by that patent, American Bioscience said it needed Bristol-Myers to list the patent in the orange book.</p>
        <p>American Bioscience had filed suit against Bristol-Myers demanding that Bristol list the patent with the F.D.A. Judge Byrne had issued a temporary restraining order last month, ordering Bristol-Myers to do just that.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Judge Byrne said that he should not have issued the restraining order because he did not have jurisdiction over the matter. But it was not clear last night whether Bristol-Myers would remove the patent from the orange book, which would free Ivax to sell the lower-cost drug.</p>
