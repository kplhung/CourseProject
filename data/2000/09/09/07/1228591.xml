        <p>In releasing a detailed economic blueprint today, Vice President Al Gore reignited a debate with Gov. George W. Bush about who can better apportion the projected federal budget surplus without driving the government back into the red and running the good economy off the rails.</p>
        <p>By making selective assumptions about which tax and spending proposals to include and how to put a price on them, both presidential campaigns can produce bottom lines suggesting that theirs is the path of fiscal prudence and their opponent's the first step toward economic ruin.</p>
        <p>The money the two sides are playing with is only hypothetical at this point, and for all the numbers flying back and forth, the issue is not really arithmetic. What matters is the clear difference in approach to economic management and use of the surplus between the two parties and their candidates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush for the most part represents conservative orthodoxy, with a heavy emphasis on tax cuts, keeping politicians from getting their hands on too much money and relying on individuals and markets to solve problems and strengthen the economy.</p>
        <p>In his view, tax cuts are a powerful way to improve the chance that the economy will continue to grow over the long term. Reducing the national debt, while an important goal, is not a singular priority.</p>
        <p>After spending much of the past several months campaigning as a corporation-bashing populist fighting for working families, Mr. Gore presented himself today as the embodiment of fiscal responsibility, brushing aside the Bush camp's accusations that he is a recklessly big-spending liberal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore emphasized his willingness to take some money out of contention for either tax cuts or additional spending, vowing to set aside $300 billion of the projected surplus over the next 10 years in case the  surplus does not materialize as projected.</p>
        <p>If the money materializes, it would go to additional debt reduction; if it does not, it would not have been promised for any particular use and thus would not be contributing to any new deficit.</p>
        <p>The 191-page document released today by Mr. Gore was written largely by economic advisers closely associated with the Clinton administration's emphasis on keeping the budget balanced and paying off the national debt.</p>
        <p>They included Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary, who colleagues said has sometimes been uncomfortable with Mr. Gore's recent populist emphasis; Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy adviser; Erskine B. Bowles, the former White House chief of staff; and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former White House chief economist and policy adviser.</p>
        <p>Those advisers generally see the strong economy as Mr. Gore's best weapon, and reducing the debt as the best way of keeping interest rates low and stimulating the investment the economy needs to remain the world's most competitive.</p>
        <p>Yet even as he presented himself as a man of economic prudence, Mr. Gore sketched a vision of an activist government willing to take on big problems. The document he released today sought to spell out for voters, with considerable specificity, how Mr. Gore would seek to harness continued prosperity on their behalf.</p>
        <p>Incomes would rise by a third, Mr. Gore promised. The poverty level would decline to less than 10 percent, from 12.7 percent. College attendance and graduation rates would increase. Income-tax rates on families making the median income would fall. The disparity between what men and women earn would be reduced by 50 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore described not just the goals, but the programs and policies he said would be necessary to achieve them, from paying off the national debt to spending $115 billion more on education in the next decade and establishing a new retirement savings program at a cost of at least $200 billion.</p>
        <p>Whether the goals are achievable is largely a matter of how well the economy does in coming years, a variable mostly outside the control of any president.</p>
        <p>The current business expansion is already the longest the nation has ever enjoyed. Should the combination of healthy growth, low unemployment and higher productivity continue for another eight years -- by no means a certainty, even if the president, Congress and the Federal Reserve make all the right choices -- many if not all of Mr. Gore's goals could be within reach.</p>
        <p>Should the economy hit the rocks, they could come back to haunt a President Gore.</p>
        <p>The entire exercise was striking for the degree of detail it involved.</p>
        <p>Eight years ago, Bill Clinton offered an economic policy agenda titled ''Putting People First.'' It was praised for, if nothing else, being detailed and concrete about his plans and priorities. In its original form, it was a few dozen pages long, an airy pamphlet alongside Mr. Gore's chart-laden presentation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has not pulled his proposals together in a comprehensive document. But his campaign released a detailed accounting of his tax and spending plans today, right down to his proposed spending increase for aid to historically black colleges and universities ($900 million over 10 years).</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush counterpunched hard, citing support for his approach from conservative, Nobel Prize-winning economists like Milton Friedman, and asserting that Mr. Gore's long list of initiatives would blow a hole in the budget.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore's camp is happy to have the campaign fought over economic management issues, seeing that as ground on which Mr. Gore is both comfortable and right.</p>
        <p>It remains unclear how much credit voters will give to the vice president for the current prosperity -- whether, as is traditionally the case, the good times will lead voters to think hard before throwing the incumbent party out of the White House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore left little doubt about how he wants to put prosperity to work, but some of his more ambitious goals were vaguely defined.</p>
        <p>He said he would seek to create 10 million ''high-tech, high-skill'' jobs during the next decade. But he did not define how those jobs would differ from other jobs, or how much better they would presumably pay than flipping hamburgers.</p>
        <p>And his prescription for creating them encompassed such broad initiatives as improving education and training and continuing to open new foreign markets to American goods and services.</p>
        <p>He said he would work to raise family incomes by a third over 10 years, largely by fostering continued improvement in the growth rate of productivity, the basic measure of economic efficiency. As productivity increases, wages and profits can rise without setting off inflation, and much of the economy's recent strength can be traced to productivity improvements.</p>
        <p>But there is no simple recipe for nurturing productivity.</p>
        <p>Productivity dropped sharply in the early 1970's for reasons that economists still do not fully understand, and has rebounded only in the past few years. The spread of computers and other information technology has obviously played a role, but no one knows for sure how long the improvement will last.</p>
