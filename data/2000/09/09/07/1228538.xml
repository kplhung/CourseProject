        <p>Investors bailed out of semiconductor stocks again yesterday, driving the Nasdaq composite index, which rallied 11.7 percent last month, to its second consecutive decline and its biggest since late July.</p>
        <p>This time the main instigator of the technology fall appeared to be Micron Technology, which slumped $9.50, to $68.75, on the New York Stock Exchange, after its rating was cut by Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Intel played a similar role on Tuesday and fell an additional $3.55 yesterday, to $65.50, on the Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>''Stocks are being downgraded, making people nervous, worried about'' price-to-earnings ratios, said Mayer Offman, the chief trading officer at Carlin Equities. ''They're in sell mode,'' he added, predicting this would persist for a few more days before the market rebounded.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq lost 129.84 points, or 3.13 percent, to 4,013.34, finishing at the session's low for the second consecutive day, suggesting to some that more selling remained to be done. The index also slipped back into negative territory for the year, down 1.38 percent.</p>
        <p>Other markets fared better, largely because strength in a handful of financial stocks and in oil shares partly offset weakness in technology and in drugs.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.83 points, or about 1 percent, to 1,492.25. Advancing issues, however, outpaced declining ones by a sizable margin, 286 to 194.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, rode another big gain in J. P. Morgan to an advance of 50.03 points, or 0.44 percent, to 11,310.64. Morgan jumped $7.81, to $167.75, accounting for nearly all of the Dow's rise, on speculation that it is to be acquired by Deutsche Bank.</p>
        <p>But semiconductors and their ilk grabbed much of the attention as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 5.71 percent, cutting its gain so far this year to just above 50 percent. Among the other big losers were Applied Micro Circuits, down $10.77, to $179.05; PMC-Sierra down $16.58, to $217.05; and Xilinx down $7.13, to $81.94.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure what to make of Nasdaq,'' said Donna Van Vlack, head trader at Brandywine Asset Management. ''Is this backing and filling or the beginning of real decay?''</p>
        <p>This week's decline of 220.99 points was the severest since a July 26-28 swoon of 366.57 points that preceded the August rally. Yesterday's volume swelled to 1.76 billion shares from 1.60 billion on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Associates First Capital was the other major financial standout yesterday, leaping $10.50, to $38.50, on word that Citigroup was buying it for $31.1 billion in stock. Citigroup fell $3.02, to $54.92.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, H. J. Heinz fell $1.75, to $35.44, after the company warned that profits in the current quarter would fall short of expectations.</p>
        <p>With prescription coverage increasingly a focus of election debate, drug stocks sank further, with Merck, downgraded by Banc of America Securities on Tuesday, down $2.19, to $65.888, and Eli Lilly, Bristol-Myers and American Home Products all down $2 or more.</p>
        <p>On the New York Stock Exchange there were 1,620 stocks that rose compared with 1,255 that fell, with 167 stocks making new 52-week highs and 32 making new lows. Volume climbed about 20 percent from Tuesday's pace to a more normal 998 million shares.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Fall  By Reuters</p>
        <p>Bond prices fell as oil prices soared to highs not seen since the Persian Gulf war and as the market prepared for a rush of investment-grade corporate debt.</p>
        <p>The price of the 10-year note fell 8/32, to 100 8/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.72 percent from 5.68 percent.</p>
        <p>The 30-year bond fell 18/32, to 107 25/32. Its yield rose to 5.70 percent from 5.67 percent.</p>
