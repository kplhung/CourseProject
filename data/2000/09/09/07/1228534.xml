        <p>Facing an uncertain climate for Internet start-ups, the founders of Africana.com Inc., the Harvard University professors Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Kwame Anthony Appiah, have sold their venture to Time Warner Inc.</p>
        <p>Professor Gates said the deal would help keep the Web site alive. ''The revenue model was slow to develop, let's put it that way,'' he said. ''I would have become worried about its future by next year unless there was some dramatic turnaround.'' Terms of the deal were not announced.</p>

        <p>Facing an uncertain climate for Internet start-ups, the founders of Africana.com Inc., the Harvard University professors Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Kwame Anthony Appiah, have sold their venture to Time Warner Inc.</p>
        <p>Professor Gates said the deal would help keep the Web site alive. ''The revenue model was slow to develop, let's put it that way,'' he said. ''I would have become worried about its future by next year unless there was some dramatic turnaround.'' Terms of the deal were not announced.</p>
        <p>Africana.com is one of many Web sites seeking a worldwide audience of African descent but takes a uniquely pedagogical approach. It concentrates on educational content, from cultural history lessons to advice on dental hygiene and investing, sometimes offering advice on generic subjects like health or finance from experts who are African-American. Other features, like links to music from radio stations around the world, address the ''African diaspora.'' Professor Gates and Professor Appiah started the site to promote an encyclopedia that they edited, Africana.</p>
        <p>Professor Gates said Africana. com still records far less traffic than others in its market, like NetNoir. com, which focuses on celebrities, or BlackVoices.com, which features chat rooms. Africana.com is for-profit but does not sell banner advertisements, seeking sponsorships instead. ''We didn't want a lot of cheap ads that would dilute the brand,'' Professor Gates said.</p>
        <p>Edward Adler, a spokesman for Time Warner, said the company hoped to use the portal to exploit its extensive library of film, television and music of interest to African-Americans. The company also envisions cooperation between Africana. com's management and its traditional media units like Time magazine and CNN, he said. When Time Warner's proposed merger with America Online Inc. is completed, Mr. Adler said, the company may include Africana.com with a version of AOL distributed free to schools.</p>
        <p>Professor Gates said that he and Professor Appiah would continue to work on the site as ''consultants and idea people.'' The site has about 20 employees, who will continue operating it, he said.</p>
        <p>Other partners have included the music entrepreneur Quincy Jones, the former Time Warner executive Martin Payson and Harry M. Lasker III, a computer consultant.</p>
