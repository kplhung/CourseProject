        <p>Andrew Golota, whose most notable and most notorious moments as a heavyweight involved low blows that twice got him disqualified in bouts with Riddick Bowe in 1996, would seem to be the ideal lighted match to toss into the Mike Tyson powder keg in their 10-round bout Oct. 20 at the Palace in Auburn Hills, Mich.</p>
        <p>''But I'm a very clean fighter,'' Golota was saying yesterday at a casual news conference at a Manhattan restaurant. ''I take three showers a day.''</p>

        <p>Andrew Golota, whose most notable and most notorious moments as a heavyweight involved low blows that twice got him disqualified in bouts with Riddick Bowe in 1996, would seem to be the ideal lighted match to toss into the Mike Tyson powder keg in their 10-round bout Oct. 20 at the Palace in Auburn Hills, Mich.</p>
        <p>''But I'm a very clean fighter,'' Golota was saying yesterday at a casual news conference at a Manhattan restaurant. ''I take three showers a day.''</p>
        <p>His sense of humor aside, the primeval appeal of this pay-per-view Showtime confrontation at $49.95, believed to be a record for a nontitle fight, is based on the ratio of spontaneous combustion in each boxer. Which one will incite the other first?</p>
        <p>''If he tries anything dirty,'' Golota said, ''it'll be toe to toe.''</p>
        <p>And if Tyson, once the undisputed heavyweight champion, were to bite Golota's ear, as he twice bit Evander Holyfield's, would Golota respond with low blows?</p>
        <p>''I hope he has a mouthpiece,'' Golota said.</p>
        <p>But seriously, would he respond with low blows? ''That's very hard to do, Golota said. He's so short.''</p>
        <p>At 6 feet 5 inches and 250 pounds, Golota will tower over Tyson, generously listed at 5-10. Now 34, Tyson has a 48-3 record with 42 knockouts, including his 38-second demolition of Lou Savarse in his bout in Glasgow in June, when he also shoved the referee to the canvas.</p>
        <p>Tyson, who was not invited to yesterday's news conference, was fined $187,500 by the British boxing commission for the shoving of the referee, but he was not suspended.</p>
        <p>In Golota's 36-4 record, with 29 knockouts, all his losses were to tall heavyweights: the two disqualifications against Bowe, a first-round knockout in 1997 by Lennox Lewis (now the World Boxing Council and International Boxing Federation champion), and a 10th-round knockout in 1999 by Michael Grant.</p>
