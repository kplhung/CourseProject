        <p>A Senate subcommittee report yesterday accused the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development of playing politics with programs for the homeless in New York City to harass the Giuliani administration.</p>
        <p>HUD officials denied the charges and countered that the Republican subcommittee chairman was the one playing politics to embarrass the Democratic Clinton administration and to help Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a fellow Republican.</p>
        <p>The report said that HUD violated its procedures last year when it barred the city from its traditional role of ranking applications from private agencies seeking federal aid for homeless programs. The report also accused HUD of withholding facts that could have ended a suit over the funds.</p>
        <p>''The record shows that HUD leaders abused positions of authority for political purposes,'' said Senator Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, who issued the report in Washington as chairman of the Subcommittee on the Veterans Administration, Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies. ''HUD not only abused the law; HUD also abused the courts.'' He called for formal investigations and sanctions against the agency.</p>
        <p>But a HUD spokeswoman, Lisa MacSpadden, said that the report was inaccurate. ''Senator Bond is playing election-year politics by creating a smokescreen to camouflage the baseless nature of his previous criticism of HUD's action in this matter,'' she said. ''The General Accounting Office reviewed these matters at the request of Senator Bond and found no wrong-doing, thus forcing the senator to turn to his own political staff to produce this political report,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The dispute stems from complaints from two advocacy groups, Housing Works and the Coalition for the Homeless, that their applications for millions of dollars in program grants had been rejected in retaliation for their criticism of the city. Housing Works sued and won an injunction last December from Judge Allen G. Schwartz of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who found ''a clear showing of a pattern of antagonism by the Giuliani administration toward the plaintiff.''</p>
        <p>Based on that ruling, Andrew M. Cuomo, the secretary of HUD, revoked the city's role as an intermediary in funneling federal aid for the homeless. But city officials insisted that they would continue review the grant applications. Eventually the city revamped its procedures to the satisfaction of the nonprofit groups and HUD, and it resumed its role. Both the Coalition for the Homeless and Housing Works won their grants, and the lawsuit was settled with the city paying $90,000 in lawyers' fees to Housing Works.</p>
        <p>HUD officials said they were obligated to act against the city after Judge Schwartz's ruling. The co-executive director of Housing Works, Charles King, called Senator Bond one-sided in issuing the report, a 77-page document with 39 attachments that did not include the judge's findings.</p>
        <p>In another criticism, Senator Bond contended that HUD prolonged the Housing Works suit by withholding from the court that the group's application would be approved regardless of the city's rankings.</p>
        <p>But the agency's officials said that revealing such information would have violated their rules on premature disclosure and that because HUD was not involved in the suit at that point, it had no obligation to the court. Mr. King said that even had his group known that it would receive the funds, the suit claiming that the city violated its First Amendment rights would not have ended.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani said yesterday that he agreed with Senator Bond's view of the dispute, adding that his Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton -- who considers Mr. Cuomo a major backer -- played a part in HUD's actions.</p>
        <p>''It seems to me it was only part of the way the federal government was being used to try to help Hillary Clinton's campaign,'' he said. ''It was an absolutely incorrect way to use a federal agency.''</p>
