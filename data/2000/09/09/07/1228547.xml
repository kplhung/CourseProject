        <p>Continuing its campaign to become the dominant financial services provider around the globe, Citigroup said yesterday that it would buy the Associates First Capital Corporation, the biggest American consumer finance company, for about $31.1 billion in stock.</p>

        <p>Continuing its campaign to become the dominant financial services provider around the globe, Citigroup said yesterday that it would buy the Associates First Capital Corporation, the biggest American consumer finance company, for about $31.1 billion in stock.</p>
        <p>The acquisition, the biggest since the formation of Citigroup in 1998, would give Citigroup a significant position in consumer lending in Japan and a few other countries. It also would improve Citigroup's standing in the credit card and commercial leasing businesses.</p>
        <p>''This transaction really fits better than most anything that we could think about,'' said Sanford I. Weill, the acquisitive chairman and chief executive of Citigroup. ''From the consumer finance point of view, the exciting thing is the global presence.''</p>
        <p>Even before he engineered the merger of the Travelers Corporation with Citicorp in 1998 -- a deal that required legislative changes in Washington that finally occurred last year -- Mr. Weill was intent on building his company's overseas businesses, especially in Japan.</p>
        <p>In one swoop, Citigroup would become the fifth-biggest consumer finance company in Japan, the world's second-biggest market for consumer lending, Mr. Weill said. Buying Associates First would give Citigroup a lending business to match the $77 billion in deposits it holds outside of the United States. Those deposits could provide a low-cost source of funds for more lending to foreign consumers to buy cars, appliances and other goods, analysts said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weill said the deal should add 10 cents a share to Citigroup's earnings next year, despite the hefty premium Citigroup is paying. Citigroup agreed to swap 0.7334 share of its stock for each share of Associates First's stock. That translates to $42.49 a share, or nearly 52 percent more than Associates First's $28 closing price on Tuesday. Associates First shareholders would own about 10 percent of Citigroup.</p>
        <p>Shares of Associates First soared on the deal, rising 37.5 percent, or $10.50, to $38.50 in heavy trading. But, to Mr. Weill's obvious disappointment, Citigroup's stock dropped $3.02, to $54.92. The two stocks were the most heavily traded shares on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.</p>
        <p>Shares of other finance companies also rose on speculation that there might be more acquisitions. Household International, the third-largest consumer finance company, rose $2.56, to $50.19. Shares of finance companies have been depressed by concerns about the quality of their loans and government inquiries into their lending practices.</p>
        <p>David Sandor, a spokesman for Associates First, said that the Justice Department had begun an investigation of the industry two years ago, but that the company had never been charged with wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>If completed, the acquisition would be the fourth-biggest deal involving United States financial companies and the eighth biggest in the financial sector anywhere in the world, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data.</p>
        <p>''I really think Sandy scored,'' said Robert Albertson, president of Pilot Financial, a money management firm in New York. ''It may not be his biggest deal, but it may be his best deal. It's a superb strategic and tactical fit.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Albertson and other analysts said they were not concerned about the rich price as long as the deal made strategic sense and would add to Citigroup's earnings quickly. Several of them predicted that the acquisition would yield even bigger immediate gains than promised.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weill said the combination should result in a reduction of $400 million in costs in the first year and $600 million over two years. About half of those savings would come from combining the two companies' credit card operations, he said.</p>
        <p>Associates First operates private-label credit card programs for several companies, including some retailers like Radio Shack and some operators of gas stations. Citigroup is already the biggest company in the United States credit card business, through its Citibank Visa and MasterCard products.</p>
        <p>''This puts us in the oil-card business, which is a very good margin business and very profitable,'' said Robert Lipp, who oversees Citigroup's consumer finance businesses and was recently named a director of the company. Mr. Lipp said that after the deal was completed later this year Citigroup would have $85 billion to $90 billion in outstanding credit on its cards.</p>
        <p>Associates First started out in South Bend, Ind., as an automobile finance company, lending people money to buy Model T Fords. It was owned for almost 25 years by the Gulf and Western Corporation, before that company sold it to the Ford Motor Company. Ford spun off a 20 percent stake in Associates First in a public stock sale in 1996 and sold the rest two years later.</p>
        <p>To cover the costs of merging the companies' operations, Citigroup will take charges against its earnings of $600 million to $700 million before taxes.</p>
        <p>Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, said the big opportunity for Citigroup was in combining the companies' consumer lending units. Citigroup's 1,200 Citifinancial branches are considerably more productive and profitable than Associates First's 750 full-service branches. Most of the loans made through Associates First's branches are home-equity loans, in which consumers borrow against the value they have built up in their homes. Citifinancial's branches offer a wider array of loan products, some of which are more profitable than home-equity loans.</p>
        <p>By bringing the acquired branches closer to its own standards, Citigroup could reap big gains, Mr. Kraushaar said. He estimated that the deal would add 15 cents a share to Citigroup's earnings next year even with ''no revenue synergies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kraushaar predicted that Mr. Weill would follow up this deal with the acquisition of another consumer finance company in Japan in an effort to quickly make Citigroup one of the top-ranked companies in that market.</p>
        <p>Sitting in his office yesterday mesmerized by the changing stock prices on a nearby computer screen. Mr. Weill did not argue with that theory. ''It will probably be a pretty fair guess,'' he said, with a smile.</p>
