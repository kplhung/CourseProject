        <p>''It's a little late, but better late than never,'' said Anthony Quinn, talking in a Park Avenue hotel room about the Hispanic Heritage Award he will receive in Washington tonight. ''I've only barely been accepted by that community.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Quinn, who turned 85 in April, still burns with the unconquerable life force he has projected in movies for more than 50 years. Retirement is not an option for the man who played Zorba the Greek. He continues to write, paint, sculpture and of course act, appearing in at least one film a year.</p>
        <p>And he continues to have strong opinions.</p>
        <p>''I was born in Mexico, during the revolution,'' he said. ''My mother and father were both young kids fighting in the revolution, and we always lived a Mexican life, even when we moved to Texas. But to be Mexicans with the name of Quinn, that was not a nice thing to do. If your name isn't Gonzalez or Montoya or whatever, they just don't acknowledge you as a Mexican.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Quinn's grandfather was an Irish immigrant to Mexico who married a Mexican and started a family. ''My father, Francesco, had the same problem I did with people making fun of him because of his name,'' he said. ''And he joined the revolution to prove that he was a good Mexican.</p>
        <p>''But I must say that I think it was a good thing, if there is such a thing as a good thing, that I wasn't accepted 100 percent by the Mexican people. Because it drove me mad, it drove me absolutely crazy.''</p>
        <p>Crazy enough, Mr. Quinn surmised, to become an actor.</p>
        <p>The Hispanic Heritage Awards, sponsored by a coalition of 34 national organizations, are meant to identify role models for Hispanic youth. This year five people are to be honored with a gala at the Kennedy Center tonight; the presentation will be broadcast by NBC on Saturday night at 10.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quinn, whose career includes at least 150 movies and two Academy Awards (best supporting actor for ''Viva Zapata!'' in 1953 and ''Lust for Life'' in 1957), is being honored for his contributions to the arts. The other honorees are Oscar Hijuelos, the novelist, for literature; Dolores Huerta, a union organizer, for leadership, Cruz Reynoso, a law professor, for education; and Sammy Sosa, the Chicago Cubs slugger, for sports.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quinn has played relatively few Hispanic characters in his long career. Beginning with his first credited screen performance, as a Cheyenne warrior in Cecil B. DeMille's ''Plainsman'' in 1936, he became Hollywood's all-purpose ethnic.</p>
        <p>He has played Chinese (''China Sky,'' 1945), Malaysian (''East of Sumatra,'' 1953), Hun (''Attila,'' 1954), Eskimo (''The Savage Innocents,'' 1959), Arab (''Lawrence of Arabia,'' 1962), Mongol (''Marco the Magnificent,'' 1965), as well as countless Italians (including the strongman Zampano for Federico Fellini in ''La Strada'' in 1954) and a couple of conspicuous Greeks: the title role in Michael Cacoyannis's ''Zorba the Greek'' (1964) and a character based on Aristotle Onassis in ''The Greek Tycoon'' (1978).</p>
        <p>Mr. Quinn theorized that his confusion over his national identity contributed to his desire to become a performer. ''One of the reasons I did all the Greeks and Arab parts I did was because I was trying to identify myself as a man of the world,'' he said. ''I lived in Greece, in France, Iran and all over the world, Spain, trying to find a niche where I would finally be accepted.''</p>
        <p>More confusion came over religious issues. Raised in an agnostic household, Mr. Quinn said he was drawn to Catholicism when, as a 5-year-old shining shoes in front of a church in East Los Angeles, he became intrigued by the spectacle he glimpsed through the doors. ''I went in, and I was absolutely amazed by the rituals. I fell in love with the Latin chanting. I asked the priest, can I ever get up on that stage? And he said, oh, yes, you can, and he took me under his wing, and I studied with him until I was 14. He was trying to make me a priest.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Quinn's grandmother was stricken with cancer during this time. He came home one day to find a group of evangelical Pentacostalists praying over her, a sight he found shocking at first but grew to accept, particularly when his grandmother showed improvement and was eventually cured. He pledged his energies then to the evangelicals, and soon became a popular preacher in the church of Los Angeles's leading revivalist, Aimee Semple McPherson.</p>
        <p>It was a short step from the pulpit to the stage. But if Mr. Quinn had found a career, he still had not settled his spiritual quest.</p>
        <p>''I used to go to both churches, just like I was both an American and a Mexican,'' he said, which led to some confusion when the time came to define a religion for four of his children. ''I had read an awful lot of books about religion, and I liked one very much, Druidism. I said each one of our kids will go every Sunday morning, and we'll sit by our favorite tree. We'll look out at the ocean, and sit there for an hour and a half, and they'll find their own religions. Consequently they all have different ones.</p>
        <p>''But I love Druidism. When I go for a walk where I live in Rhode Island, I know all the trees and all the birds, and they all have names. There's a maple tree right in front of where I have breakfast every morning, and I've fallen in love with it. It's just a wonderful tree.</p>
        <p>''The tree and I have now become close friends, and it tells me its history. You can't help it at my age, you start thinking strange things. And it's interesting, because now I can't kill any animal, not even mosquitoes. It's stronger than I am.</p>
        <p>''I discovered the property six years ago and bought it. I think I bought it because I own a piece of ground in Greece, which Greece has never really given me the title to. A hundred acres of ground on the island of Rhodes that I bought from the Queen of Greece for $50,000. I spent about a million dollars improving it. And then one day the queen called me up and told me she had been thrown out.</p>
        <p>''She told me, 'Tony, they will try to take the land away from you, but never give it up.' And the government has never given me permission to build a house there. When I think of Rhode Island, I think of Rhodes, and I think that's why I bought it. It's a way of getting back at the Greek politicians.''</p>
        <p>It's a property that sees a lot of activity. Mr. Quinn is the father of 13 children by 5 women. The youngest of the children are 4 and 6.</p>
        <p>''I had just had a heart operation when I bought it, and I think I was reborn. I was just looking at myself and wondering who the hell I was. I've discovered an awful lot about myself in the last few years.</p>
        <p>''I got angry at one of my sons, who wrote in the newspaper that I was a different man, that he had seen me someplace and he thought I had had a lobotomy. And I said, 'Are you saying I needed a lobotomy?' He said, 'Pop, I've never seen you like this.'</p>
        <p>''So I guess I've gotten younger. Some miracle happened, and I'm now a younger man than I was 10 years ago. I'm still excited about life, I'm still finding out wonderful things about life.</p>
        <p>''In my will I had left that I wanted to be buried in Mexico. They would take me up to the top of a mountain in Chihuahua and leave me there, on a rock. I was really very comfortable about that. But when I was there in April, a friend asked me if I wanted to see the place, and he flew me out in a helicopter. It was 175 miles away. My wife said, 'How the hell am I going to bring you flowers when you're so far away?'</p>
        <p>''So I had to think of another place. Now, it's Rhode Island. Under the tree.''</p>
