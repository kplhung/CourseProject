        <p>The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the most powerful union to withhold a presidential endorsement, will vote today to support Vice President Al Gore, several Teamster officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the union's 24-member board would vote in Washington to endorse Mr. Gore, despite the union's often-expressed anger at the vice president over his support for the China trade bill.</p>
        <p>The Teamsters officials said their union's president, James P. Hoffa, was pleased about Mr. Gore's populist turn, his pledge to do more to help the nation's working families and his promise to negotiate worker protections in future trade agreements. Mr. Hoffa, these officials said, is also happy that Mr. Gore is increasingly talking about the importance of making it easier for unions to organize additional members.</p>
        <p>''It's because Gore moved at the convention and since the convention to have a more pro-working class kind of agenda,'' one Teamster official said. ''He's become increasingly believable as someone who cares about these issues.''</p>
        <p>For the Gore campaign, the Teamsters' endorsement is expected to be especially important in the swing states of the Midwest, where the Teamsters were founded and where they still have a powerful presence.</p>
        <p>One Teamsters official said Mr. Gore would speak on Sept. 17 at a meeting of the union's political action coordinators in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>After the United Auto Workers endorsed Mr. Gore last month, the Teamsters, with 1.4 million members, was the one large union still on the sidelines, often giving the impression that it would remain neutral. Mr. Hoffa lavished praise on Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, for his criticism of growing corporate power and unfettered global trade. Mr. Hoffa also seemed happy to be wooed by the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>One Teamster official said the executive board had decided to endorse Mr. Gore after an internal poll showed that 90 percent of the union's leaders across the country preferred Mr. Gore, while only 10 percent backed the other presidential candidates. Several officials said internal polls of the rank and file also showed solid majority backing for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>One Teamster leader said the general view among the union's officials was that Mr. Gore, despite his position on China, was far closer to Mr. Hoffa and the union's positions on the minimum wage, Social Security, the right to organize and other issues than was Gov. George W. Bush, the  Republican presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>Douglas Hattaway, a Gore campaign spokesman, said, ''Of course,  we'd like their endorsement, but we haven't heard word of anything.''</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a Bush campaign spokesman, said, ''Regardless of whatever the official endorsement is, we're confident the governor will enjoy the support of many of the rank-and-file workers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoffa has sought to persuade the federal government to end its decade-long supervision of the Teamsters, intended to root out corruption from what had been one of the nation's most mob-infested unions. Mr. Hoffa has said that the union is largely cleaned up and that he has put in place strong internal mechanisms to keep it clean.</p>
        <p>Teamster officials said Mr. Gore had made no promise whatsoever about ending the supervision in exchange for the Teamsters' backing.</p>
