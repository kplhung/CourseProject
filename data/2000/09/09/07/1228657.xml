        <p>John Thompson III was named coach of the Princeton men's basketball team yesterday, following the career path of his father, who built Georgetown into a basketball power. The appointment came on the same day Bill Carmody left to become coach of Northwestern.</p>
        <p>It will be the first head coaching job for Thompson, 34. He has been an assistant coach the past five years at Princeton under Pete Carril and Carmody.</p>
        <p>Thompson has three starters returning from a team that was 19-11 last season, losing in the first round of the National Invitation Tournament to Penn State. But the Tigers sustained a major loss a little more than a week ago when the unanimous All-Ivy League center Chris Young signed a baseball contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Ivy League does not allow athletes who sign a professional contract in one sport to play in another.</p>
        <p>Thompson, a former Princeton player, graduated in 1988. A forward, Thompson was co-captain in his senior year and shared the team most valuable player award as the Tigers went 17-9. (AP)</p>
        <p>CARMODY GOES TO NORTHWESTERN: After 18 years at Princeton, the last four as head coach, Bill Carmody was named yesterday as the coach at Northwestern, a team that was 5-25 last season.</p>
        <p>Winning as often as he did at Princeton, where he was 92-25 in four seasons after replacing Pete Carril, will not be easy. Instead of Dartmouth and Cornell, he will be going against Michigan State and Indiana.</p>
        <p>Northwestern did not win a game in the Big Ten last season and now must adjust to a new coach after the resignation of Kevin O'Neill, who left last week to become an assistant with the Knicks.</p>
        <p>I come in with my eyes open, Carmody said. I know it's going to be a rough situation.</p>
        <p>There is an impression that Princeton still wins by holding the ball with a deliberate style that is low scoring and frustrating for defenses. But Carmody says his teams play a style that is suited to their talent, not a system. He quickly moved to convince some of Northwestern's players.</p>
        <p>The offense is very free and open and flowing, he said. I showed some of the players a tape from Princeton. We're not holding the ball; that's a perception. It's not a dictatorship. The players will tell you how to play. It's basketball. Guard your man, make shots and let's go. (AP)</p>
        <p>CORNELL HIRES A PENN ASSISTANT: Cornell University named Steve Donahue as its new coach, handing him a program that finished last in the Ivy League last season. Donahue has been an assistant at the University of Pennsylvania for the past 10 years.</p>
        <p>Donahue replaces Scott Thompson, who resigned in July after four years as coach. Thompson, who has colon cancer, took another position within the university's athletic department. (Bloomberg News)</p>
