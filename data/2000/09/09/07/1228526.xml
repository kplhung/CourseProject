        <p>To his enemies, whose numbers seem to be growing by the day, Luiz Francisco de Souza is ''the Torquemada of Brasilia,'' a reincarnation of the fanatic priest who commanded the Spanish Inquisition.</p>
        <p>But Mr. de Souza is a federal prosecutor, not a cleric, and he bristles at the suggestion that he is engaged in anything other than a crusade to bring honesty, openness and accountability to government here.</p>
        <p>''The more the truth is hidden, the easier it becomes for iniquity to reign,'' he said in an interview. ''There is a lot of corruption in Brazil, and many things to be ashamed of, but we also have a Constitution that clearly spells out the functions and powers of a prosecutor, and those are to defend the democratic order and morality in administration.''</p>
        <p>Mr. de Souza owes his controversial image and sudden prominence primarily to an investigation he is leading into the whereabouts of nearly $150 million that vanished during the still unfinished construction of a federal courthouse in Sao Paulo.</p>
        <p>As a result of his efforts, a senator was recently expelled from office for corruption and the chief labor court judge in Sao Paulo is now a fugitive, with his bank accounts frozen and posters seeking his arrest on display at every airport.</p>
        <p>But even before that case put him in the national spotlight, Mr. de Souza, 38, led a separate inquiry that forced the lower house of the Brazilian Congress to banish one of its members, a former state police chief, now imprisoned for his part in the murders of dozens of opponents and criminals, some of whom were butchered with chain saws and thrown into acid baths.</p>
        <p>And after prosecutors found that cabinet ministers and other top officials were flying to beach resorts on air force planes at taxpayer expense, a law was passed banning that practice.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most astonishing of all to Brazilians, who are accustomed to seeing favoritism and nepotism at high levels go unpunished, is that Mr. de Souza and his team have not hesitated to make their own colleagues targets when malfeasance is suspected. After a prosecutor in Sao Paulo, for example, was recently found to have received a $51,000 check from a figure involved in the courthouse case, they ordered an investigation opened against him, too.</p>
        <p>As might be expected, the targets of Mr. de Souza's prosecutorial zeal are none too happy these days.</p>
        <p>One exasperated bureaucrat last month labeled the federal prosecutor's office here ''a judicial loony bin.'' And with municipal elections scheduled for October, members of Congress have accused Mr. de Souza of trying to advance his own career and the interests of opposition parties at their expense.</p>
        <p>''What you are doing wounds the sensibilities of many people,'' Senator Pedro Simon, a prominent member of the government coalition, complained at a recent congressional hearing. ''A prosecutor sends some mayor from a town in the interior off to jail and he becomes a star on television.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. de Souza's efforts seem to delight and amaze the average Brazilian. On the streets, he is recognized with increasing frequency, and is often greeted with pats on the back, thumbs-up signs, honks from car horns or shouts of encouragement.</p>
        <p>''Let the scoundrels squirm,'' Evandro Vieira Milhomem, a waiter here, said approvingly of those who have been caught up in Mr. de Souza's investigative web. ''It's about time that somebody called the rich and powerful to account and made them understand that the law applies to them, too, and not just to us poor folks.''</p>
        <p>Part of Mr. de Souza's appeal is the novelty of the crusading prosecutor, a figure who, while quite familiar in the United States, is not common here. In fact, until the ratification of the Constitution drawn up after the fall of a military dictatorship in 1985, one of the main duties of the Public Ministry, as the prosecutor's office is known, was to defend the federal government against lawsuits and provide legal counsel to the executive branch.</p>
        <p>But the current Constitution, dating from 1988, not only set up a separate advocate general's post to fill those functions, but it gave prosecutors a whole gamut of new powers to ferret out wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>Today, their responsibilities include the ''defense of the judicial order, the democratic regime and of social and individual interests,'' ranging from the environment and monitoring the behavior of police forces to assuring Indian and consumer rights.</p>
        <p>''I think what they are doing is wonderful,'' said David Fleischer, president of the Brazilian chapter of Transparency International, an anti-corruption group. ''They are filling a void, playing a role like that of the Government Accounting Office or the inspector general'' in the United States and ''doing what the executive and legislative branches really ought to be doing themselves but are not.''</p>
        <p>At first glance Mr. de Souza would seem an unlikely candidate for the role of the defiant defender of the public interest. He is mild-mannered in the extreme, even timid, is gawky and slightly hunchbacked, tends to mumble in a childlike voice when confronted by a battery of cameras or reporters and has ascetic personal habits that the newsmagazine Veja describes as eccentric.</p>
        <p>But in a society used to seeing the rules bent, it is precisely Mr. de Souza's rectitude that seems to have made him a celebrity. A former Jesuit seminarian who reluctantly gave up his religious vocation because of health reasons, he lives with his parents in a modest house here, drives a battered old Volkswagen Beetle, donates part of his $4,500-a-month salary to charity and has only one known extravagance: a personal library of some 7,000 books.</p>
        <p>''Like those possessed by divine fire, Luiz Francisco is austere and simple,'' Veja reported in a profile last month. ''He has two sports jackets, one single pair of shoes, and his few shirts are all identical and white.''</p>
        <p>Ingenuous or not, Mr. de Souza and his colleagues have so irritated the government that a ''gag law'' proposal to prohibit prosecutors, judges and the police from making any public comment on pending cases, and punish violations with fines of up to $125,000 and three years in prison, has been revived and sent to Congress. Mr. de Souza's response is that what Brazil needs is more publicity about official misbehavior, not less.</p>
        <p>''That court building was only able to get so much money from the government because for years the work of the auditors who were investigating it was held under lock and key,'' he said. The National Association of Prosecutors has also condemned the initiative, arguing that it would hobble the work of public officials who ''work tirelessly to fulfill their constitutional duty to defend the public patrimony.''</p>
        <p>''The function of all the great biblical prophets was to go to those who rule and say, 'You cannot do this,' to denounce illicit actions even at the cost of their own lives,'' Mr. de Souza said. ''It is amazing that we are now in a new millennium and we still have people who are trying to silence those who dare to open their mouths against infamy.''</p>
