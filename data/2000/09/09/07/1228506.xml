        <p>ROCCO arrived for physical therapy at Bonnie's K9 Swim Center in Manhattan, prancing with excitement, a bandana knotted around his thick furry neck and metal wheels strapped to his withered hind legs. Rocco, a 10-year-old German shepherd, had lymphoma last summer, followed by a ruptured disk requiring emergency surgery.</p>
        <p>In a gesture of paternal tenderness combined with the umph of a furniture mover on the last landing, Lenny Addamo, Rocco's owner, lowered the 90-pound dog into the waiting arms of Jodi Richard, who was already submerged to her shoulders in 87-degree water and ready to right Rocco adroitly as he started to roll and submerge. The pool's surface, lightly dusted with dog hair, boiled around Rocco's flailing front paws as Ms. Richard, the owner of Bonnie's K9, a new therapy center for dogs, held on to his hips.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, physical therapy was mainly for people. Pets, even when valued as guardians and companions, received limited medical care and were often euthanized when they were deemed too old, too infirm or too expensive to treat. Today, as pets become more prized, and a booming economy creates more discretionary income, pet care might include a $400 customized weight-loss program at a health spa.</p>
        <p>While the yellow pages bulge with listings for fancy poodle parlors, the latest pet spas are beginning to offer the same therapies available to humans -- from electro-stimulation to underwater treadmills. With fees kept low to attract all comers (an average $15 an hour for massage or swim therapy), these new therapy centers are only beginning to meet the demand of pet owners eager not only to indulge but also to save their animals. Typical of the new breed of pet spa is Bonnie's K9 in Chelsea, which offers massage and acupuncture as well as homemade organic dog food. Ms. Richard invested about $500,000 (with contributions from her husband, Dwight Merriman, co-founder of DoubleClick, an Internet advertising firm) to open the 2,000-square-foot center, designed by 1100 Architects of New York to be airy and odor-free. It is named after the couple's German shepherd, Bonnie, who had been caged for the first years of her life for breeding and, as a result, is paralyzed in her hind legs.</p>
        <p>Ms. Richard, who is earning a veterinarian technician degree (the equivalent of a nursing degree), has two full-time employees and works most nights until 8. She charges $35 for 30 minutes of swim therapy ($25 if the pet owner conducts it); $50 for a swim and doggie massage. A juice bar for humans is in the works.</p>
        <p>One recent evening, clad in a wet suit to keep from getting scratched, she handed a panting client a natural dog biscuit (and ate one too). ''Some people think I'm crazy to be doing this,'' she said, ''but it's extremely rewarding.''</p>
        <p>Veterinarians refer their clients to Ms. Richard, who treats dogs suffering from hip dysplasia, degenerative spinal disorders, cancer and other diseases resulting from dogs living longer than in the past.</p>
        <p>''We were overwhelmed when we found out that Rocco was probably never going to walk again,'' said Dr. Dina Addamo, a resident doctor at Mount Sinai who had to work extra night shifts to help pay over $10,000 for her dog's cancer treatments. Rocco is currently in remission.</p>
        <p>''We'd do practically anything; he deserves it,'' she added in a typical display of the unwavering strength of the animal-human bond.</p>
        <p>Operating on a much larger scale, on farmland 50 miles east of Pittsburgh, is the Baden-Baden of New Age pet spas, the sprawling Cozy Inn Pet Resort and Spa. Here, one afternoon last week, workers led a 1-year-old black Labrador runt named Zoey in for a therapeutic swim session. Unable to stand for very long because of a congenital affliction caused by overbreeding, Zoey is shaky as a newborn foal. But once in the pool, she takes off like the swimmer she's supposed to be. Afterward an attendant wraps Zoey in a clean towel and returns her to a cage with a private door flap leading into the yard.</p>
        <p>''At one time you took a dog with problems out and shot it,'' said Carol Boerio-Croft, the founder of Cozy Inn. ''Now dogs have a much better lifestyle. They're not disposable anymore; they're part of the household.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Boerio-Croft, whose husband, Dr. Henry L. Croft Jr., is a veterinarian, was among the first to sense a growth industry in the making. Fourteen years ago she created a boarding center for pets and offered luxury amenities like facial massages and off-leash nature walks. Three years ago, she added the Mozart wing, a step-down center for postsurgical and geriatric dogs named after her terrier mutt, which died of cancer. The $2 million complex is steeped in pet-theme memorabilia, from plaster dog statues on the lawn to ''101 Dalmatians'' clocks. There are two indoor pools: one is shaped like a bone; the other is a whirlpool in the shape of a dog paw.</p>
        <p>Business is brisk, with about 250 dogs on the grounds every day. Rates average $16 a day, generating enough income to allow the Crofts and an investor to underwrite a $3 million center in Pittsburgh, which is to open this winter. They say they hope it will serve as a prototype for a pet-care chain offering everything from vacation centers to education and spa treatments.</p>
        <p>In Annandale, Va., Stan Marks, a real estate broker, was inspired to build a rehabilitation clinic for small animals after he was unable to find the care he wanted for his 14-year old German shepherd, who died four months ago from degenerative bone disease. The Royal Treatment center, which is opening in six months, will offer conditioning and weight-loss programs, hydrotherapy and range-of-motion exercises.</p>
        <p>''People today are willing to go any distance for their pets,'' said Mr. Marks, who spent over $5,000 on hip replacements for his dog and even tried taking her to a horse farm in Virginia for swim therapy, but the water was 11 feet deep and too cold. ''I'm the perfect example. And there are a lot of 'me's' out there.''</p>
        <p>Although physical therapy has been used on thoroughbred racehorses and greyhounds for at least 20 years, it is new to the world of pets. Determined to improve and prolong the lives of their animals, the aging Me Generation has become the Me and My Four-Legged Companion Generation.</p>
        <p>''People are demanding these services,'' said Mr. Marks, who is already planning to open a second center next year in suburban Washington. ''It's a whole new area of veterinary medicine, and it can't move fast enough to meet the demand.''</p>
        <p>A survey last year of 1,200 pet owners by the American Animal Hospital Association found that pet owners were more likely to take their animals to the veterinarian regularly than they were to see a doctor themselves. (Eighty-four percent of the respondents called themselves Mom or Dad when talking to their pets.)</p>
        <p>The new therapy centers tend to focus  more on dogs than on cats, perhaps because cats live longer (16 years on average). Large dogs are considered old when they are 8. Modern medicine, often coupled with alternative methods and an insistent clientele, has stretched that natural limit.</p>
        <p>Shelly and Jack Galati of Riverdale, N.Y., have a 15 1/2-year-old Labrador named Sydney that has been undergoing acupuncture for three years. When Sydney began falling on slippery floors, they started looking for  additional treatments. ''We know she's old, and we don't expect her to get better,'' Mr. Galati said. ''We just want to keep her as she is.''</p>
        <p>Veterinarians are traditionally accustomed more to emergency medical care (''Help! My dog ate the remote control!'') than to prevention and wellness care. The American Veterinary Medical Association has been cautious in embracing treatments like acupuncture and physical therapy, although it agrees that there is anecdotal evidence supporting their benefits. The veterinarians who recommend physical therapies say that animals tend to respond to treatment better than humans because they don't resist their exercise regimes and they have a higher threshold of pain, making it possible to rebuild muscular tissue more efficiently.</p>
        <p>At present, there are no degree programs  or licensing requirements for physical therapists for pets. ''It's a bit of a problem, '' said Dr. Robert B. Parker, head of surgery department at the Animal Medical Center, a highly regarded animal hospital in Manhattan. ''It involves a lot of issues on the front lines of what should be done by a licensed veterinarian and what a lay person should do.'' (He often makes referrals to Bonnie's K9 for post-op dogs.)</p>
        <p>The insurance industry, which has been curbing reimbursements for physical therapy for humans, has inadvertently supplied a talent pool for budding animal therapists.  Two years ago, the American Physical Therapist Association started helping members explore the pet field ''in part because insurance is not reimbursing people for continued physical therapy,'' said Cheryl Riegger-Krugh, who runs the organization's special interest group on animal physical therapy. She added that while people without insurance coverage tend to drop out of treatment, people with pets don't seem to mind paying for it out of their own pockets.</p>
        <p>Ms. Boerio-Croft, the owner of Cozy Inn, has probably gone the limit herself. She spent $85,000 to fly her Irish wolfhound to Colorado for a bone marrow transplant with limited results. ''I bought him 8 months,'' she said, ''And I was happy to get it.''</p>
