        <p>Even as he was leaping high above the rim and leading Hartford Public High School to two state championships, Marcus Camby never counted on playing in the National Basketball Association. Instead, Camby planned for a more realistic career.</p>
        <p>''My first goal was always to be a principal, not necessarily to be in the league,'' Camby, a native of Hartford, said yesterday. ''I had a vice principal in high school who I thought the world of. He had a great relationship with me, as well as with the rest of the students. He was somebody I wanted to pattern myself after.''</p>
        <p>Now a multimillionaire forward for the Knicks, Camby is still inspired by the example of Frank DeLoreto, his vice principal at Hartford Public. That is one reason he will help the students at P.S. 194 in Harlem today kick off the first day of school with March With Marcus.</p>
        <p>This morning at 7:15, Camby will meet about 800 students at Colonel Young Park and march four blocks to class. His goal is to help increase attendance in schools and to promote education in one of the city's most impoverished school districts. After the march, Camby will address the students in the school's auditorium and hand out school supplies.</p>
        <p>This will be the third straight year Camby has held his March With Marcus, but it is his first time participating in New York. The first two marches were in Hartford, where he said his involvement helped increase the opening-day attendance at the Sand and Clark Street Elementary Schools from roughly 48 percent to 98 percent.</p>
        <p>''I feel that if the kids can see me, an N.B.A. player get up early in the morning and walk them to school, it hopefully can be contagious,'' Camby said.</p>
        <p>While it is commonplace for professional athletes to visit elementary schools, Camby's connection with P.S. 194 will be more than a one-time event. Camby, still interested in becoming a principal when his playing career is over, has committed himself to participating throughout the school year as a reader in the school's book of the month program and will even serve as the principal for a day.</p>
        <p>He has asked Sandy Small, the school's principal, to teach him the dynamics of running a school.</p>
        <p>''I'm going be his mentor,'' said Small, who added that the opening-day attendance rate at P.S. 194 is 86.7 percent. ''I was thrilled to find out that he is really interested in education and that he's not just doing something to do it. He told me he wants this to be his second career, and I thought that was just fabulous.''</p>
        <p>Camby majored in education before entering the N.B.A. after his junior year at the University of Massachusetts. He said he is only one semester short of earning his degree, and that he hopes to complete the necessary course work during the coming season.</p>
        <p>''It's going to take some hard work, balancing playing and trying to do schoolwork,'' Camby said. ''But I have my laptop and a lot of spare time when I'm on the road.''</p>
        <p>Camby has spent much of the summer rehabilitating a sore right knee, which severely limited him during last season's playoff run. He said he is 95 percent healthy and that he  began doing on-the-court drills at full speed two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>During the summer, Camby was disappointed to hear his name come up in trade talks. He understands that his play last season left much to be desired, but said the Knicks should not be worried about failing to land a rugged rebounder like Brian Grant or Danny Fortson in free agency. He said now that he is healthy, he will fill the bill.</p>
        <p>''My knee is feeling stronger and I'm feeling like I can lift,'' Camby said. ''Last season, I really couldn't lift. I wasn't really dunking and getting up and catching lobs like I'm used to. But now I'm finally getting it back.''</p>
        <p>Camby, who averaged 7.8 rebounds in 26.2 minutes a game, added: ''They say they need a rebounder and I feel that I'm that rebounder. I know that when I'm healthy and on top of my game, I'm a real tough guy to play and figure out. So hopefully, everybody can come back and regroup and get this thing done.''</p>
        <p>Staying or Going</p>
        <p>The likelihood that Patrick Ewing will return to the Knicks next season grows by the day. Talks with the Washington Wizards about a Ewing for Juwan Howard trade have broken down, an Eastern Conference official said.</p>
        <p>The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Knicks would continue to pursue opportunities to trade Ewing, who desperately wants out of New York.</p>
