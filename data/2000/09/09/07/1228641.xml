        <p>Pete Sampras was staring across the net at the one player who has been able to defuse his atomic serves with his own, and the one opponent who has been able to emerge from their matches with barely a scratch over the years.</p>
        <p>It was the steel-coated Richard Krajicek. He had taken six of his last eight matches against Sampras, and put together a head-to-head record no other active player has approached.</p>
        <p>For so long last night, inside a nervous Arthur Ashe Stadium, Sampras looked as if he would succumb to Krajicek's strange hold over him again. Sampras was in trouble after sleepwalking through the first set, and was about to fall into the abyss when he found himself down by 2-6 in the second-set tie breaker.</p>
        <p>''I was getting outplayed,'' Sampras said. ''I thought it was going to get away from me. I got lucky. I don't know how I won it.''</p>
        <p>Somehow, Sampras pulled off a great escape on his way to a 4-6, 7-6 (6), 6-4, 6-2 quarterfinal victory last night at the United States Open. The fourth-seeded Sampras, who will meet ninth-seeded Lleyton Hewitt in a semifinal match on Saturday, felt fortunate to advance. An unflappable Krajicek, who fired 23 aces to just eight by Sampras, was serving for the set with his gaudy lead in the tie breaker.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how you lose that tie breaker,'' Krajicek said. ''I didn't do anything really wrong. I think he just did a good job. There's nothing I can blame on myself.''</p>
        <p>Sampras recovered, in part, because of a mis-hit off a backhand return of serve at 3-6 in the tie breaker that turned into a point to keep him alive. Sampras also pulled a half-volley out of his hat, and conjured up a couple of tremendous responses to Krajicek's powerful serve, including one forehand return that cracked right in the corner for a winner. Krajicek looked on helplessly.</p>
        <p>After a run of five straight points to take the second set, Sampras was pumping his fists as he walked to the changeover with new life.</p>
        <p>''It was meant to be that he would win that set,'' Krajicek said. ''I guess it was his tie breaker.''</p>
        <p>He was sensing a turnaround. The lethargic demeanor that Sampras revealed early in the match vanished as the third set unfolded.</p>
        <p>''My confidence rose,'' Sampras said. ''I knew I was back in it.''</p>
        <p>In the third set, Sampras put in 79 percent of his first serves. In the fourth, he hit a solid 70 percent. There was little Krajicek could do to force a break of serve when Sampras was pouring on such force. Other than serving percentage -- and Krajicek was at 58 percent -- the statistics were almost even. Krajicek came up with 46 winners to Sampras's 49. Sampras had 19 unforced errors; Krajick had 16. But when it came to breaks of service, Sampras converted 4 of 6 opportunities while Krajicek was 2 of 8.</p>
        <p>''I didn't like the way I played in the third and fourth set,'' Krajicek said. ''That's what's disappointing.''</p>
        <p>Once he was revived by the second-set tie breaker, Sampras was dominant again, putting in 67 percent of his first serves. On match point, Sampras whipped a service winner that bounded off the frame of Krajicek's racket.</p>
        <p>A relieved Sampras had finally found a way to slip by the one player who has been his nemesis.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I needed to make a statement,'' Sampras said. ''It was a big match, and the fans were great. They really got behind me.''</p>
        <p>Sampras needed their help, particularly in the second-set tie breaker. In some ways, Sampras was in a similar situation against Patrick Rafter in the Wimbledon final. Once again, he was down in the second-set tie breaker, feeling the match slip away.</p>
        <p>''It was like Wimbledon,'' Sampras said. ''It was a matter of a point here or there. I thought I was finished. I thought I was gone. At Wimbledon, I thought I was just a few nails away in the coffin.</p>
        <p>''My will is always there, especially for a big match like today. But I needed a little luck today. I thought it was going to be a tough battle to come back. He was making me work hard, and he was outplaying me.</p>
        <p>''If I'd been down two sets to love,'' Sampras said, ''it would have been a tough hole to get out of.''</p>
