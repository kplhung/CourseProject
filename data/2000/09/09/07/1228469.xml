        <p>MUCH of what will glitter this fall will be gold. ''Gold is a neutral color that is warm and flattering, like candlelight,'' said Sherri Donghia, the design director of Donghia Furniture and Textiles. ''Gold is no longer a color just for holidays.''</p>
        <p>Nor is it appropriate only in traditional settings. Now, some futuristic fabrics used for spacesuits and running shoes are gold colored and show up as modern upholstery fabrics.
