        <p>Re ''Globalization Tops 3-Day U.N. Agenda for World Leaders'' (front page, Sept. 3):</p>
        <p>You quote critics who assert that the secretary general's ''global compact,'' designed to identify and promote good corporate practices in human rights, labor standards and the environment, opens the United Nations' doors to big business. These critics ignore the fact that the compact is an equal partnership among business, international labor and global nongovernmental organizations. The United Nations has guidelines for dealing with business; they were adopted in July.</p>

        <p>Re ''Globalization Tops 3-Day U.N. Agenda for World Leaders'' (front page, Sept. 3):</p>
        <p>You quote critics who assert that the secretary general's ''global compact,'' designed to identify and promote good corporate practices in human rights, labor standards and the environment, opens the United Nations' doors to big business. These critics ignore the fact that the compact is an equal partnership among business, international labor and global nongovernmental organizations. The United Nations has guidelines for dealing with business; they were adopted in July.</p>
        <p>You report that one critic suggested that the inclusion in the global compact of companies that may have had spotty records in the past sends the wrong signal. The implication is that the United Nations should strive to improve the performance only of the perfect. Doing so would make life easier, but what would be the point?</p>
