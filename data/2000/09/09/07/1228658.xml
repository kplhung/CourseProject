        <p>The Nets signed their second-round draft pick, center Soumaila Samake, to a multiyear contract, the team announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Terms of the deal were not announced. The Nets' president, Rod Thorn, said Samake runs the floor well and has the ability to block shots.</p>
        <p>The 7-foot-1-inch Samake, who is from Mali, was the 36th player taken in the 2000 draft and played last season with the Cincinnati Stuff of the International Basketball League, averaging 9.7 points and 7.6 rebounds while leading the league in blocked shots with 2.7 a game.</p>
        <p>He played six games for the Nets in the recent Boston Summer League.</p>

        <p>Cleaves holds the assists record for Michigan State and the Big Ten at 816. He had a school-record 195 steals. (AP)</p>
