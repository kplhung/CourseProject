        <p>Following are excerpts from an internal Ford Motor Company memorandum dated March 12, 1999, referring to concerns about the possibility of a tire recall in Saudi Arabia. In the first section, which was made available to reporters on Tuesday, Ford indicates that Firestone opposed a recall there for fear that the tire maker would have to report it to United States regulators.</p>
        <p>The second section was blacked out by Ford when first given to Congressional investigators. Ford supplied the complete document yesterday to investigators, who provided a copy. It indicates that Ford's general counsel had similar concerns about a recall.</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from an internal Ford Motor Company memorandum dated March 12, 1999, referring to concerns about the possibility of a tire recall in Saudi Arabia. In the first section, which was made available to reporters on Tuesday, Ford indicates that Firestone opposed a recall there for fear that the tire maker would have to report it to United States regulators.</p>
        <p>The second section was blacked out by Ford when first given to Congressional investigators. Ford supplied the complete document yesterday to investigators, who provided a copy. It indicates that Ford's general counsel had similar concerns about a recall.</p>
        <p>The memo is addressed to Dave MacKinnon, Ford's regional marketing manager in Dubai, from Chuck Seilnacht, a Ford export official. ''U.S. D.O.T.'' stands for the United States Department of Transportation. ''OEM'' is an abbreaviation for 'original equipment manufacture.'' ''I.tt'' is generally believed to be shorthand for ''I talked to.'' And ''OGC'' stands for the ''office of the general counsel'' at Ford.</p>
        <p>Firestone legal has some major reservations about the plan to notify customers and offer them an option. First, they feel that the U.S. D.O.T. will have to be notified of the program, since the same product is sold in the U.S. Second, they are afraid that the Saudi government will see this as a recall and react dramatically, including prohibiting the import of the current OEM tire. They believe the best course of action for the vehicles already in the market is to handle the tire issue on a case-by-case basis. . . .</p>
        <p>I.tt Corey MacGillivray in the OGC last Monday about the proposal. He didn't think that working on a case-by-case basis with the owners of the damaged vehicles presented a problem, but he was concerned about the implications of the owner letter (similar to the Firestone concerns). He was going to check with one of his colleagues to get more info. . . .</p>
