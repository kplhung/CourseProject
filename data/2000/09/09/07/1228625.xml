        <p>With oil prices surging to their highest level in a decade, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson called on oil-exporting nations today to increase their production.</p>
        <p>''My hope is that OPEC seriously considers increasing production,'' Mr. Richardson said, referring to the 11-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>
        <p>As crude oil prices rose to $34.90 a barrel in New York today -- the highest level since the 1990 military buildup before the Persian Gulf war -- Mr. Richardson said that energy costs were ''unacceptably high.'' American officials voiced concerns that home heating oil prices this winter could be 30 percent more than they were last year.</p>
        <p>In remarks to reporters, Mr. Richardson said OPEC should increase production enough to reduce prices to $20 to $25 a barrel or risk further disrupting the world economy. OPEC ministers are scheduled to meet in Vienna on Sunday.</p>
        <p>World markets ''are very clearly insisting that there's not enough oil on the market to bring stability,'' Mr. Richardson said.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration is under increasing pressure to do something about oil prices. The White House has prepared a contingency plan to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, although it has not yet acceded to demands from some lawmakers to do so.</p>
        <p>On a trip in February to the Middle East, Mr. Richardson secured a promise from Saudi Arabia to raise its output. The Saudi oil minister reported today that his nation had increased production by an additional 600,000 barrels a day since July, a 7 percent increase.</p>
        <p>American officials have so far declined to say exactly how much additional production they are seeking from OPEC nations.</p>
