        <p>Donovan McNabb was standing on the sideline last Sunday when the Eagles lost the coin toss to the Cowboys.</p>
        <p>Eagles Coach Andy Reid approached McNabb before the kickoff and told him, ''Make sure you have your helmet around because we're thinking of doing an onside kick here.''</p>
        <p>McNabb was startled. ''It wasn't something that was said in the locker room and guys got all excited and jumped on their lockers and did flips,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Reid, whose team will host the Giants on Sunday, drew up the play in minicamp after the special teams coach John Harbaugh suggested that the Cowboys might be susceptible to an onside kick. Reid, Harbaugh and kicker David Akers kept their secret until game time, and Reid had no trouble persuading them to take him seriously when he made the decision.</p>
        <p>''I guess it sends a message,'' Reid said today. ''I wasn't trying to make a statement to the world.''</p>
        <p>Intentional or not, Reid and the Eagles made everyone around the National Football League take notice. No one is taking the Eagles lightly after their 41-14 mashing of Dallas. The maurauding defense produced five sacks and gave Troy Aikman the ninth concussion of his career.</p>
        <p>''That was a momentum change,'' McNabb said of the onside kick. ''That sort of uplifted our spirits a bit.''</p>
        <p>Reid is a builder. His father, Walter, painted backdrops for theater sets. His son grew to enjoy carpentry and become a cabinet maker in his spare time. He likes working on old cars and owns a 1928 Model-A Ford.</p>
        <p>''Last year I thought we could build a foundation,'' said Reid, whose club finished 5-11 in 1999. ''I thought we did for the most part. By the end of the season we were headed in the right direction. We are hoping to come into this year and get back to where we finished last year and keep building forward.''</p>
        <p>Reid did not arrive in Philadelphia to a hero's welcome. The Eagles were booed by their fans for passing up running back Ricky Williams to draft McNabb with the second overall pick in last year's draft. Reid explained today that with running back Duce Staley on the roster, the Eagles needed a quarterback.</p>
        <p>The boos grew louder when the Eagles stumbled to an 0-4 start but McNabb won the starting job and Staley continued to excel. Staley, one of only two offensive starters still in place when Reid took over, produced his second straight season of over 1,000 rushing yards.</p>
        <p>Staley thrust himself into the class of elite running backs Sunday. He ran for 201 yards and added 61 receiving. He will present a tough test for a Giants defense that limited the Cardinals to 43 yards rushing.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't a grudge match,'' Reid said of choosing McNabb. ''We were new and there was a lot of national publicity for Ricky and not quite as much for Donovan. We really just wanted to do what was best for the organization. If you do that in the long run, it will work out for the whole city.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Safety SAM GARNES was listed as questionable for Sunday by the Giants after sustaining a concussion against the Cardinals when he collided with JESSIE ARMSTEAD. Garnes practiced in light pads with no contact today. He was still awaiting the results of tests. ''You never know until you get a hit,'' Garnes said. ''I wish somebody would hit me.'' . . . Tight end PETE MITCHELL, who underwent surgery after spraining his knee in the preseason opener, participated in individual drills and was listed as questionable. Veterans Stadium's notoriously unforgiving artificial turf could delay Mitchell's return. . . . Coach JIM FASSEL made it clear what running back JOE MONTGOMERY needs to do to avoid being inactive for a second straight week: ''You go out and show Coach Fassel that you are going to be a major contributor on special teams, which he is being given a chance to do. I explained that to him, and he's going to be rotating in regularly on special teams this week and he'll have some reps at fullback.'' Fullback CRAIG WALENDY played special teams last week but committed two penalties.</p>
