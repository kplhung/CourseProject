        <p>Fukuoka, Japan, has been called the Venice of Asia for its extensive network of canals and bridges. It might also be called the Seattle of Asia, since it is a rainy city. Thus there are underground pedestrian tunnels connecting stores to hotels, and office buildings to train stations. But tunnels don't have to be gloomy. In 1997, the Iwataya department store chain hired the Walker Group/CNI, an architectural firm in Manhattan, to design a new store in Fukuoka. The Iwataya Passage, connecting the store to a train station, was a bonus: a passageway suffused with light. ''We came up with a metaphor of bridges and evoking the character of water,'' said Jay Valgora, a designer at Walker Group/CNI. The 400-foot-long passage, 10 1/2 feet high and 16 feet wide, shimmers. The center part, top left, has glass panels coated with fine metal particles, which act like prisms. Panels are tilted at angles and suspended on stainless steel cables. ''The colors change, and the reflections of the people change,'' Mr. Valgora said. The ceiling, left, has glass pieces suspended from steel cables. As people walk through, they hear music, Haiku poetry whispered in three languages and the sounds of water. Motion detectors also trigger sounds. The tunnel's $1 million cost was shared by Iwataya and the city of Fukuoka. Mr. Valgora collaborated on the tunnel with two Manhattan design companies, FTL/Happold Architects and Engineers, and Art in Commerce, which did the music installation.</p>
