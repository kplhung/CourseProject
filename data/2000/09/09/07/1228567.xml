        <p>The opening salvos were predictable.</p>
        <p>As the union representing New York City teachers kicked off contract negotiations with the city yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani called for merit bonuses for teachers and the elimination of teacher tenure. Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, rejected those demands and said that city teachers needed salaries equal to those in suburban schools.</p>
        <p>But behind the bravado that marked the beginning of contract talks, the union and the mayor both realize that they are entering into critical negotiations that will not only affect the lives of 78,000 teachers, but may also end up significantly changing instruction for 1.1 million public-school children. Because of the worsening teacher shortage, the strong economy and increasing pressure to hold schools more accountable, both sides are likely to make concessions that could significantly change how teachers are compensated, as well as the rules they work by.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weingarten, for example, hinted that she was willing to experiment with a longer workday and year for teachers, perhaps starting with a small group of schools whose teachers agreed to the changes.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that teachers deserved fatter paychecks and that he had in fact set aside money to finance raises for city workers. But he said teachers needed to work at least one additional period a day. And as he has done for months, Mr. Giuliani said the most important raise would come in the form of merit pay for teachers whose students' performance improved.</p>
        <p>''There has to be a recognition that not all teachers are equal,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''Because when you do that, say all teachers are equal, you reduce it to the lowest common denominator.''</p>
        <p>Noticeably quiet yesterday was Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, who attended the negotiating session with senior aides but refused to discuss his expectations for the new contract. Mr. Levy will probably play a crucial role at the bargaining table, trying to smooth relations between the mayor and the union while ensuring that parts of both sides' most important demands are met.</p>
        <p>Like the union, Mr. Levy believes that New York City cannot attract nearly enough qualified teachers unless it significantly raises their base salary. On the other hand, he shares the mayor's desire for teachers to work longer hours and for principals to be able to remove the worst teachers without long bureaucratic delays.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Levy has good relationships with both the union and the mayor and empathizes with each side, he may be able to emerge from the negotiations with his most pressing need met: the ability to attract thousands of qualified teachers to his school system.</p>
        <p>''Harold is in a perfect position to broker an innovative and educationally productive deal,'' said Robert Berne, vice president for academic and health affairs at New York University. ''The mayor can get more productivity, the teachers can get more pay and Harold can get more qualified teachers.''</p>
        <p>But to get what he wants, Mr. Levy will have to be careful not to appear too sympathetic to either side. Mr. Giuliani fought Mr. Levy's appointment last winter on the ground that he was too cozy with the teachers' union. Mr. Levy has publicly distanced himself from the union in recent months, a move that some education officials described yesterday as a shrewd bargaining tactic.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Ms. Weingarten repeated what in recent months has become her mantra: that the city would be foolish not to raise salaries at least to match those in suburban school districts. City teachers are now paid $31,910 to $70,000 a year, with senior teachers earning up to 30 percent less than their suburban counterparts. But Ms. Weingarten also suggested that her members were willing to consider some changes in teacher work rules.</p>
        <p>''We made many different proposals that showed a lot of openness to doing things differently,'' she said after the negotiating session, held at the city's Office of Labor Relations.</p>
        <p>The only such proposal that Ms. Weingarten would publicly discuss was one that would allow a small number of the city's 1,100 schools to decide their own work rules, including the length of the school day and year. Teachers and principals would jointly decide on the rules, although Ms. Weingarten did not say exactly how it would work.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration has frequently pointed to the the city's new contract with the school principals' union as a model for the teachers' contract. That agreement ended tenure for principals, required them to work a longer school day and eliminated their two-month summer vacation. In exchange, principals got a 33 percent pay raise.</p>
        <p>But some education experts said yesterday that since teachers are not in managerial positions, as principals are, they need tenure protection. While most principals around the nation do not have tenure rights, most teachers do, Mr. Berne said. ''It's a standard practice around the country, and teachers need it because they are in fact vulnerable to political whims,'' he said. ''We would be noncompetitive without tenure.''</p>
        <p>As for the merit pay issue, it seems unlikely that the teachers' union will accept a system of rewarding individual teachers based on their students' performance. Ms. Weingarten said yesterday that it would ''undermine the teamwork, collegiality and collaboration that is necessary for schoolwide improvement.'' Mr. Levy has also expressed misgivings about merit pay for individual teachers.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Ms. Weingarten has hinted that she would not resist a merit pay program that rewarded every teacher in a school in which student test scores improved. Such a program is a likely compromise, especially if the new contract also includes across-the-board raises.</p>
        <p>''They could do a group incentive program and raise salaries in exchange for more year-round teaching,'' Mr. Berne said. ''Merit pay will have some significance during the negotiations, but it's not going to be the make-it-or-break-it issue.''</p>
