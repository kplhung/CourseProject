        <p>People attending the United States Open this month at Flushing Meadows Tennis Center must choose among several matches happening simultaneously. But tennis fans can hop from court to court online, browsing the action at will. With the Slam Cam, the online cameras at Usopen.org, users can direct up-to-the-minute still cameras and even determine the zoom intensity on three courts: the Arthur Ashe Stadium, the Louis Armstrong Stadium and the Grandstand. The cameras use TrueLook software developed in 1996 by a Chicago company, Perceptual Robotics, and installed by technicians from I.B.M., the sponsor of the Web site. I.B.M. also uses the Slam Cam at Wimbledon, the French Open and the Australian Open. The cams have been operating on Usopen.org since 1997, but this year they have become one of the site's most popular features, especially during rain delays and when two popular matches are in progress at the same time.</p>
