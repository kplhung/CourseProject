      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says evidence emerging in Congressinal inquiries into Firestone tires on Ford Explorers makes it apparent that both companies were aware of safety problems long before they took action to address them, and that National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, badly underfunded, was sluggish in reacting to number of tips about case; says story should remind Congress that when it comes to safety, free markets are no substitutes for adequately funded federal watchdog</p>

        <p>The precise reason that the treads on certain Firestone tires on Ford Explorers have been peeling off with deadly consequences is not yet clear, but evidence emerging in Congressional inquiries is making it increasingly apparent that both companies were aware of the safety problems long before they took action to address them. Equally worrisome is the fact that even once the companies did act in some foreign markets, they refrained from doing so in the United States.</p>
        <p>An internal Ford memorandum written in March 1999 indicates that the companies disagreed on whether they had a legal obligation to notify American regulators about a planned recall of tires in Saudi Arabia. Ford ultimately recalled the tires but did not notify the regulators. The Ford memo suggests that Firestone opposed the Saudi recall out of concern that it would have to be reported in the United States, a contention that was vigorously denied by Firestone officials testifying before Congress yesterday. In Venezuela, Ford and Firestone face the prospect of a criminal investigation over the tires.</p>

        <p>The precise reason that the treads on certain Firestone tires on Ford Explorers have been peeling off with deadly consequences is not yet clear, but evidence emerging in Congressional inquiries is making it increasingly apparent that both companies were aware of the safety problems long before they took action to address them. Equally worrisome is the fact that even once the companies did act in some foreign markets, they refrained from doing so in the United States.</p>
        <p>An internal Ford memorandum written in March 1999 indicates that the companies disagreed on whether they had a legal obligation to notify American regulators about a planned recall of tires in Saudi Arabia. Ford ultimately recalled the tires but did not notify the regulators. The Ford memo suggests that Firestone opposed the Saudi recall out of concern that it would have to be reported in the United States, a contention that was vigorously denied by Firestone officials testifying before Congress yesterday. In Venezuela, Ford and Firestone face the prospect of a criminal investigation over the tires.</p>
        <p>Ford's failure to share news of recalls overseas with American regulators is not acceptable behavior. United States laws should compel a multinational company to advise American regulators of a recall of an unsafe consumer product in another country when that product is also sold domestically.</p>
        <p>The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration did not learn about Ford's 1999 replacement of tires in Saudi Arabia and more recent recalls in Thailand and Malaysia until last May, after press reports and insurance company notices finally prompted the agency to launch its own investigation into some 1,400 incidents that resulted in 88 deaths and 250 injuries in America. At the safety agency's request, Firestone last month recalled 6.5 million tires used on Ford Explorers in the United States, but has refused the agency's subsequent request that it recall an additional 1.4 million tires used on other models.</p>
        <p>Relations between Ford and Firestone have frayed under the intense scrutiny. In their Congressional testimony yesterday, the companies pointed the finger at each other. Ford maintained that it had relied on Firestone's representations about the tires' safety, and Firestone said it believed that incidents in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere often involved under-inflated tires.</p>
        <p>For years, Ford suggested a lower pressure for tires on its Explorer than did Firestone. Further investigations will have to determine whether Ford set the lower level merely to provide a more comfortable ride, or whether it did so to compensate for a lack of structural stability in the Explorer.</p>
        <p>The highway safety agency was sluggish in reacting to a number of tips about this case, which may be a result of severe budgetary cuts over the past two decades. If so, this unfolding story should remind Congress that when it comes to safety, free markets are no substitutes for an adequately funded federal watchdog.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 9, 2000, Saturday  An article in Business Day on Aug. 31 about a regulatory agency investigation of defective Firestone tires misstated the name of the agency. The error also occurred in an editorial on Thursday and an Op-Ed article yesterday. The agency is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, not the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.</p>
