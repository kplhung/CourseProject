        <p>The foundation started more than two years ago to help spur and direct further redevelopment after the New Jersey Performing Arts Center opened here is seeking developers to help create a downtown residential and retail district.</p>
        <p>The New Newark Foundation, created by the philanthropist Raymond G. Chambers, hopes that the land it controls in downtown will be transformed with businesses and homes and that it will bridge two parts of the city: the area, on the east side, around the performing arts center, Penn Station, Riverfront Stadium and a proposed sports arena; and the area west of the city's main thoroughfare, Broad Street.</p>

        <p>The foundation started more than two years ago to help spur and direct further redevelopment after the New Jersey Performing Arts Center opened here is seeking developers to help create a downtown residential and retail district.</p>
        <p>The New Newark Foundation, created by the philanthropist Raymond G. Chambers, hopes that the land it controls in downtown will be transformed with businesses and homes and that it will bridge two parts of the city: the area, on the east side, around the performing arts center, Penn Station, Riverfront Stadium and a proposed sports arena; and the area west of the city's main thoroughfare, Broad Street.</p>
        <p>If the plan is successful, it could provide the round-the-clock street life that city officials and others say is necessary to sustain a downtown revival. The foundation hopes to reach out to the rather insular commuter campuses of Rutgers in Newark and its law school, the New Jersey Institute of Technology and the University of Medicine and Dentistry.</p>
        <p>''Bringing in a population that is there 24 hours a day has been the key to downtown revitalization in other cities,'' said James A. Schmidt, the executive director of the foundation.  ''And as a private, nonprofit organization directing development, we have the ability to say what type of use is better without looking at the bottom line all the time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmidt said a thick stack of brochures and planning studies were sent out to about 60 developers today, seeking proposals for the area controlled by the foundation: an eight-square-block area bound by Broad Street to the east, Washington Street to the west, Central Avenue to the north and Raymond Boulevard to the south.</p>
        <p>Mayor Sharpe James applauded the call for proposals and said that it would be the first ''real test'' of what had up to now been ''all talk and vision'' from the foundation.</p>
        <p>In the last two years the group has had two changes in leadership, which kept local officials wondering if it still had the backing and enthusiasm of Mr. Chambers. Mr. Chambers, who grew up in Newark, is one of the principal owners of the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils, as well as the chief benefactor of the performing arts center, which opened in 1997.</p>
        <p>''There was a lot of talk and vision but they didn't do anything,'' said Mr. James. ''I'm excited over these first positive steps at showing people that Newark can offer attractive and convenient downtown living.''</p>
        <p>Crucial to the foundation's vision for the area are two long-vacant, landmark buildings on Broad Street;  retail development is planned on the ground floors, and residential development above. One is the squat, four-story, turn-of-the-century building that once housed the Hahne Department Store. The other is the adjacent Griffith Piano Company Building, a  slender, 17-story structure adorned at the top with terra cotta harps and other musical instruments.</p>
        <p>Both buildings have been vacant for nearly 25 years, casualties of the city's decline and the exodus of businesses after the 1967 riots.</p>
        <p>The rest of the planned development area is made up of smaller, three- and four-story residential and commercial structures, some large and small vacant parcels. The idea is to keep the small, village-like scale of the area, Mr. Schmidt said.</p>
        <p>Donald Eisen, executive vice president of Cushman and Wakefield, the  commercial real estate brokers,  called the plan ''an iffy proposition'' because Broad Street might prove too wide a chasm for the development that has fueled the city's renaissance so far. He said residential development closer to the performing arts center and the proposed arena might have more chance of success.</p>
        <p>The conceptual plans for the redevelopment project was formulated over the last two years with the help of a consortium: Ehrenkrantz, Eckstut &amp; Kuhn Architects; Mikesell &amp; Associates; and Paulus, Sokolowski &amp; Sartor engineers. The group hopes to choose a developer early next year, Mr. Schmidt said</p>
        <p>Mary Ann Tighe, vice chairman of Insignia/ESG, a commercial real estate company, called the foundation's effort to pull the development energy to the west ''a worthy goal.'' The market, she said, would judge the rest. ''If the foundation is willing to accept lower prices for their property, they may be able to achieve their goal,'' she said. ''And it seems as if they are looking at the long-term goal of making Newark healthier rather than at what the market is saying right now.''</p>
