        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's campaign announced yesterday that it would begin running a new commercial attacking Vice President Al Gore's credibility on the issue of debates.

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's campaign announced yesterday that it would begin running a new commercial attacking Vice President Al Gore's credibility on the issue of debates. The 30-second spot is to run in select markets in some, but not all, of the 17 closely contested states where the Bush campaign is already running commercials. But campaign officials declined to name the states.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Maverick Media</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Video footage of Mr. Bush seated comfortably in a chair, looking relaxed in a blue shirt with an open collar. Cut to shots of Mr. Gore appearing more tense as he is being interviewed on two television shows. Closes with the words, ''If we can't trust Al Gore on debates, why should we trust him on anything,'' superimposed on a black screen.</p>
        <p>SCRIPT -- Female announcer: ''Labor Day weekend, Governor Bush accepts a record five national debates. March 14, Al Gore says he'd debate on CNN. July 16, Al Gore said he'd debate on NBC. When it was politically convenient, Gore said he'd debate 'anytime, anyplace, anywhere.' Now that Governor Bush has accepted, Gore says 'unacceptable.' Does Al Gore now mean debates depend on his meaning of 'anytime, anywhere?' If we can't trust Al Gore on debates, why should we trust him on anything?''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The spot ignores the broader context of the debate over debates, and in many ways distorts it. Mr. Gore has agreed to all three of the 90-minute, prime-time debates organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group that has been running debates since 1988. Mr. Bush has agreed to appear in only one commission debate and proposed joint appearances with Mr. Gore on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC and on CNN's ''Larry King Live.'' Both of those appearances would be 60 minutes long and, unlike the commission debates, would not be covered by all three networks. Mr. Gore contends that Mr. Bush is trying to reduce the number of people who can watch the debates and says he will not appear in any of Mr. Bush's proposed forums until the governor agrees to the three commission debates. But Mr. Bush contends that the vice president has backed away from his pledge to debate Mr. Bush ''anytime, anywhere.''</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mr. Bush's campaign is trying to fit the scuffle over debates into his broader attack on Mr. Gore's character and honesty. The line about ''his meaning of anytime, anywhere,'' is a sly reference to President Clinton's defense regarding his relationship with a White House intern: ''It depends on what the definition of is is.'' But this commercial could also remind voters that Mr. Bush, not Mr. Gore, is the one trying to sidestep the commission debates, and in that way underscore Democratic contentions that he is afraid to go one-on-one with the vice president before the largest possible national audience.</p>
