        <p>WHEN Ricky Martin swiveled his hips at the 1999 Grammys, he set off a tide of Latin pop record sales in this country. A year and a half later, on the eve of the first Latin Grammys, a new group of Internet entrepreneurs is trying to ride that tide by offering  Latin music Web sites that include crash courses in the different rhythms of mambo, bomba and merengue and also sell the latest salsa and rock en Espanol CD's.

Its Supermall sells CD's by top-of-the-charts Latin performers and links users to a site to make their own CD's.</p>

        <p>WHEN Ricky Martin swiveled his hips at the 1999 Grammys, he set off a tide of Latin pop record sales in this country. A year and a half later, on the eve of the first Latin Grammys, a new group of Internet entrepreneurs is trying to ride that tide by offering  Latin music Web sites that include crash courses in the different rhythms of mambo, bomba and merengue and also sell the latest salsa and rock en Espanol CD's. And while many Spanish-language music sites originate from Brazil and Mexico, these upstarts from the United States are in English to attract a new audience: bilingual Hispanic-Americans as well as fans who do not speak Spanish.</p>
        <p>Francisco de la Torre founded Eritmo.com (www2.eritmo.com) one year ago to fill a void on the Net.  Latin music styles vary from country to country, de la Torre reasoned, so Eritmo.com (''ritmo'' means rhythm in Spanish) customizes news and information with separate pages and headlines from Puerto Rico, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and the United States. Eritmo.com publishes limited concert reviews, news and opinion articles, and music rankings by country. It also has chats, puzzles and games. Its Supermall sells CD's by top-of-the-charts Latin performers and links users to a site to make their own CD's.</p>
        <p>If Eritmo.com feels like the sterile but stocked neighborhood superstore, the LaMusica.com site (www.lamusica.com) is a fan's basement, crammed with colorful photos and video interviews with the stars of the Latin pop, salsa, merengue and Tejano scenes. What LaMusica.com does best is to give access to small concerts and corner top performers in interesting places. When visited recently, the site had an interview with Son by Four in Central Park and one with Marc Anthony, holding forth from a bed (fully clothed). The site includes timely reviews of festivals sponsored by radio stations and of rare concert appearances, and links to Latin music radio shows featuring styles like freestyle and Latin jazz.</p>
        <p>The Spanish word ''descarga'' means ''to unload,'' but it also refers to a type of musical jam session. In that spirit, Descarga.com (www .descarga.com) is an amalgam of opinion, instruction and sales. Critical essays that assume familiarity with major figures in Latin music, and rare recordings and percussion instruments, like afuches and timbales, for sale make the site seem like a Greenwich Village music shop on the Web. The glossary is basic but useful for those encountering decades of Latin music for the first time. The catalog includes hard-to-find recordings like Israel (Cachao) Lopez's Cuban jam sessions and Afro-Cuban Santeria vocal and drum music.</p>
        <p>Two-year-old LA'Ritmo.com (www.laritmo.com) offers Top 25 charts in several Latin music genres, as well as the Tu Ritmo collection of digital sound clips, a handy sampling tool that gives beginners who cannot decipher Spanish labels a place to start looking for Latin CD's. The Latino Wired news link chugs with the latest industry music news and is updated daily; the extensive archives of reviews, charts and interviews go back two years.</p>
        <p>Dgolpe.com (www.dgolpe.com) offers a vast English- , Spanish- and Portuguese-language digital catalog for downloading, and though the six-month-old site's name is a pun on the Spanish word for coup, Dgolpe.com insists that all of its MP3 downloads are legal. Ritmoteca.com (www .ritmoteca.com), which made its debut in December, has a Latin catalog on its site, which is decorated with a deep red border, maracas and bongos. Artists' pages offer brief biographies and discographies to help users select CD's.</p>
        <p>A Latino lifestyle site, Latino.com (www.latino.com), available in Spanish and English, has an extensive music section, with news articles on things like hip-hop and salsa, and video links to Latin artists, but its best item is a map. The clickable, color-coded guide describes and matches Latin musical genres to their countries of origin.</p>
        <p>There are dozens of fan pages for specific artists and categories, as well as specialized sites with narrow city and club guides. Salsaweb.com (www.salsaweb.com) is a bright site with a few salsa headliner tour schedules, a listing of dance events around the world and an eclectic collection of features on topics like Japanese salsa and dance floor etiquette. The Latin Jazz Network (www.latinjazznet.com) compiles reviews, profiles and in-depth interviews with musicians, and links users to a calendar of jazz festivals and other events, as well as to Latin jazz radio stations online.</p>
        <p>For a primer on the backbone of Latin music, the spare but colorful Latin Rhythms site (www.cam.org /raybiss/rhythms) pulses with clickable musical staffs and congas with brief explanatory paragraphs for each pattern of beats. Latin American Musical Styles (havana .iwsp.com/radio/lamusic) illustrates its regional glossary of Latin genres, from aguinaldos (Venezuela) to zouks (French Caribbean), with clickable snippets from popular recordings of each.</p>
        <p>Visually oriented fans can click on a handful of Latin artists' streaming videos on AllLatinMusictv.com (www.alllatinmusictv.com), including one from the legendary Celia Cruz and a video of Enrique Iglesias performing an English cover of Yaz's ''Only You.''</p>
