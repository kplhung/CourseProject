        <p>LEPORE-Michael J., M.D. The Medical Staff of St. Vincent's Hospital mourns with sorrow the passing of a dear friend, mentor and esteemed colleague. Dr. Lepore joined our faculty in 1966 as Chief of the Section of Gastroenterology and Director of the Upjohn GI Unit. Dr. Lepore's research and medical practice enhanced the lives of thousands of grateful patients. He authored over 65 publications and textbooks. In 1982 he wrote ''Death of the Clinician'' a book in which he examined how education overemphasizes the science of medicine to the neglect of the art of caring for the sick. A physician of great courage, wisdon and intensity, he was a fierce and vocal advocate of the private practice of medicine and the sacred patient-physician bond. We will forever cherish the memory of this champion of medicine and extend our heartfelt sympathy to his son Frederick. Joseph M. Jabbour, M.D. President of the Medical Staff St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center</p>
        <p>LEPORE-Michael J., M.D. The Section of Gastroenterology of St. Vincent's Hospital mourns the loss of our Chief, leader, and role model-the great teacher and clinician, the unique, uncommon, compassionate caregiver, overtime in his dedication to patient care. James G. Robilotti Jr., M.D. Chief, Section of Gastroenterology St. Vincent's Hospital</p>
        <p>LEPORE-Michael M. The Meltzer family extend their heartfelt sympathy to the Lepore family upon the death of their beloved brother, Dr. Michael Lepore. He will be greatly missed. We love him too. The Meltzer Family</p>
