        <p>Less than two weeks after experts told the United Nations that it needed an in-house policy center to work on areas of tension before they turn into international crises, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda came along this week with a case in point.</p>
        <p>More than six years after a frenzy of ethnic killing tore his small African country apart, armed militia and former soldiers thought to be guilty of some of the killings are still roaming free in neighboring Congo. A plan to deal with them should have been worked out long ago by United Nations officials drawing on their collective skills, Mr. Kagame said in an interview. To him, they are the reason there is a war in Congo.</p>
        <p>In New York for the summit meeting of world leaders, Mr. Kagame said that until the Hutu responsible for killing Tutsi and their moderate Hutu allies are disarmed and resettled somewhere in peace, Rwandan troops will stay in Congo. The presence of foreign troops -- from Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- is also a major impediment to dispatching a United Nations peacekeeping operation.</p>
        <p>''The U.N. has enough resources and expertise -- and even experience from other situations -- to come up with a proposal,'' Mr. Kagame said. Breaking the cycle of blame and counter-blame between Rwanda and the Congolese government would mean separating fewer than 10,000 Rwandans who, he said, are mixed with troops from Congo and its allies.</p>
        <p>''There are many ways of dealing with the problem,'' he said. ''One is working together to see that these people don't get support from other governments. Let's put them into camps and disarm them. Let's repatriate them to Rwanda or take them elsewhere. I don't see why the U.N. can fail to do that.</p>
        <p>''They keep coming to us and asking us what we feel they should do, but this is simply trying to run away from the problem.''</p>
        <p>Tens of thousands of exiles have returned voluntarily, he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kagame said the costly business of keeping Rwandan troops in Congo to seal the border burdens the reconstruction of Rwanda, a country of about 7.5 million people.</p>
        <p>He said that Rwanda, like Cambodia, will suffer for a long time from the loss of much of its middle class in the killings. The events of 1994 left up to 800,000 Rwandans dead and led several months later to the overthrow of a Hutu-led government by Tutsi-led rebels whom Mr. Kagame commanded. He has been the central power figure in Rwanda ever since, although he did not assume the presidency until this year.</p>
        <p>The middle-class professionals lost to Rwanda came from both ethnic groups. Mr. Kagame said that in addition to those who were killed, many of the 120,000 Rwandans charged in the attacks and still in jail are also middle class: priests, civil servants, local political leaders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kagame, who has tempered the fury he first expressed at the failure of the United Nations and its leading members, including the United States and France, to prevent or end the massacres, now focuses his criticism on what he sees as an international failure to recognize that a country so profoundly wounded cannot be treated like just any place.</p>
        <p>''My country has to be treated as a special case,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He rejected suggestions that the Hutu majority and Tutsi minority will never be reconciled.</p>
        <p>''There has been nothing in the past to demonstrate that they can't live together,'' he said, ''but I do see a solution in the better political, economic and social management of the country.''</p>
