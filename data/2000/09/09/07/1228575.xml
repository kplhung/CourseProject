        <p>The day before classes were to begin for 1.1 million New York City public school students, parents  across the city found that the teachers they had expected in their schools had been ordered by the Board of Education to report to classes elsewhere in the city.</p>
        <p>As a result of the last-minute shuffling, hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of students at some of the city's best-organized and most successful schools will come to school today to find themselves in classes without teachers, Board of Education officials acknowledged.</p>
        <p>The reshuffling is the result of a new state policy aimed at steering the most qualified teachers to the most troubled schools. Nevertheless, board officials said that there is no way to force the displaced teachers to accept their new assignments, and that in the end, they could be lost to the system entirely.</p>
        <p>''It's horrifying,'' said Sue Schneider, whose daughter is a seventh grader at Middle School 54 on the Upper West Side. Parents and administrators at M.S. 54 were on the phone late yesterday afternoon trying to prevent three newly hired teachers -- one in science, one in humanities and one in English as a second language -- from being reassigned to other schools. Two of the teachers had spent large parts of the summer getting to know the school and preparing for their classes, parents said.</p>
        <p>''We saw these brand new bright-eyed wonderful faces, all excited about teaching, and they were told to report to central. I looked at them and thought, 'in a second, any one of them could get a job in business,' '' Mr. Schneider said.</p>
        <p>When the assignment policy was first announced about two weeks ago, it appeared that its main effect was to limit the options of teachers being hired in the last few days before school started -- forcing them to take jobs only in the most troubled schools.</p>
        <p>But Board of Education officials said yesterday that evidence was mounting that the policy is having a broader impact and is backfiring. It appeared, they said, to be affecting even schools that had done their hiring well in advance, and was generating anger, frustration and hostility on the part of well-organized middle-class parents.</p>
        <p>Parents reported a wave of complaints about teachers being bumped at schools across the Upper West Side -- including P.S. 75, P.S. 163, P.S. 145 and P.S. 207. Patricia Romandetto, the superintendent on the Upper West Side, did not return several telephone requests for comment.</p>
        <p>Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for Chancellor Harold O. Levy, said the reassignment of teachers was not limited to any one part of the city.</p>
        <p>''This is systemic,'' Ms. Feinberg said.</p>
        <p>The hiring crisis stems from a dispute between Mr. Levy and Richard Mills, the state education commissioner, over how to ensure that there are qualified teachers in the city's 94 worst schools, designated as failing by the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills has ordered the city to fill more than 400 positions at those schools with certified teachers -- including 195 vacancies and 239 jobs filled by uncertified teachers who are now being forced out. When Mr. Levy resisted, Mr. Mills got a court order on Aug. 24 ordering him to do so. Mr. Levy has argued that Mr. Mills is being overly dogmatic in using certification as the only measure of a good teacher. Mr. Mills, for his part, said last week that the board's bureaucracy had slavishly overreacted to the court order.</p>
        <p>''I just find it totally absurd and unfair that the kids are being used as pawns in a game of chess between two educators,'' said Betsy Combier, president of the PTA at M.S. 54.</p>
