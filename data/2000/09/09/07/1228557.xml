        <p>The space shuttle Atlantis is set to head for the International Space Station on Friday, beginning an intense push to finish the long-delayed orbital research outpost.</p>
        <p>The Atlantis and its seven-member crew are to blast off at 8:45 a.m.  Eastern time, beginning an 11-day mission to outfit the growing station for the arrival of its first permanent residents in November. The flight begins a surge of 15 station-related missions by American and Russian rockets during the coming year, which will greatly increase the station's size and functions.</p>
        <p>Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said today that no major problems stood  in the way of the launching, though there were some weather concerns.</p>
        <p>Shuttle managers are giving the shuttle only two and one-half minutes to lift off, starting at 8:45 a.m., about half the time usually allotted for missions to the space station.</p>
        <p>Officials said that launching when the shuttle's ground position is aligned perfectly with the space station's orbit could save fuel normally used to steer the shuttle toward its moving target. Having more fuel will make it easier for the shuttle to deal with any thrust shortfalls in its main engines, they said. It also makes it more likely that the spacecraft could return to an American landing strip  if engine problems develop.</p>
        <p>NASA officials said the flurry of flights, after more than two years of delays in building the station, would be one of the most intense periods of human space flight ever.</p>
        <p>Ron Dittemore, the space agency's shuttle program manager, said,  ''This mission begins a series of station-assembly flights aboard the shuttle during the next year that will be as complex as anything NASA has ever done, including landing a man on the moon.''</p>
        <p>The Atlantis's mission, hauling equipment and supplies to the station and getting the living quarters ready for occupancy, will be followed in October by a flight of the shuttle  Discovery to haul up the first segment of a scaffoldlike truss on which other segments will be built. The shuttle Endeavour is to go up in November with the first segment of American solar power panels, after the arrival of a Russian Soyuz ship carrying the first crew.</p>
        <p>Eight shuttle flights are scheduled for 2001, starting with delivery of the American science laboratory Destiny. The last time NASA flew eight shuttles in one year was in 1997, and a record of nine went up in 1985, the year before the Challenger explosion, which resulted in cutting back the ambitious shuttle program.</p>
        <p>Because of studies raising safety concerns about launching so many flights, NASA began hiring hundreds of new people, particularly safety engineers. And space shuttle contractors have added hundreds more.</p>
        <p>The Atlantis crew of five American and two Russian astronauts will start this renewed activity by unloading its two tons of supplies and equipment and 1,300 pounds of material from an unmanned Russian Progress cargo ship, which docked with the station last month, to outfit the service module, Zvezda.</p>
        <p>The shuttle, commanded by Col. Terrence Wilcutt of the Marines on his fourth trip into space, and piloted by Cmdr. Scott D. Altman of the Navy on his second shuttle flight, will dock with the station on the third day of the mission. The crew will wait almost two days before entering the station, first conducting a critical space walk to connect segments of the outpost electronically.</p>
        <p>An American astronaut, Edward T. Lu, and a Russian counterpart, Yuri I. Malenchenko, are to spend six and one-half hours scaling 110 feet of the 140-foot-tall station to connect nine communication and power cables, on the most distant space walk ever from a shuttle.</p>
        <p>The shuttle is to return to the Kennedy Space Center on Sept. 19.</p>
