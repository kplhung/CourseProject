        <p>ALBANY: SPITZER JOINS YESHIVA SUIT  The state attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, left, has joined the American Civil Liberties Union in a lawsuit charging that Yeshiva University illegally denied a lesbian couple campus housing in a dorm for married couples. The lawsuit was filed by the A.C.L.U. in 1998 but was dismissed last year by a trial judge in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, whose decision was upheld in May by a panel of the court's Appellate Division. On Tuesday, the A.C.L.U. petitioned the Court of Appeals in Albany to hear the case. The two women are medical students at the university's Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. Mark Jacoby, a lawyer for the university, declined to comment.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: NOT-GUILTY PLEA IN BREAK-INS  A man charged with a series of violent robberies on Manhattan's Upper West Side pleaded not guilty yesterday at his arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court. The man, Van Baskerville, 32, has been linked to six break-ins, one this summer in which a Manhattan homeowner was assaulted and remains in critical condition. Mr. Baskerville faces 20 counts of attempted murder, assault and burglary. He has three convictions on burglary and other charges.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: ANOTHER MONTH OF SPRAYING  New York City's health commissioner, Neal L. Cohen, said yesterday that pesticide spraying to combat West Nile virus would continue for at least a month, or until disease-bearing mosquitoes were wiped out by three consecutive nights of freezing temperatures. He said there were seven new cases of dead birds across the city, including crows in Riverside Park and City Hall Park, a cormorant in Central Park and an American kestrel at Clove Lakes Park on Staten Island.

        <p>THE BRONX: SCALDED CHILD DIES  A 14-month-old boy died yesterday after being scalded with hot water, the police said. They said they expected an autopsy to classify the death as a homicide. Around 11:45 a.m. yesterday, a 911 caller reported that a child was unconscious at 831 Bartholdi Street in the Olinville section, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman. The boy, Justin Majors, was found in the bathroom with burns on his torso and lower body. He died at Montefiore Hospital. The father, whose name was not released, was at home and was being questioned last night, Detective Pentangelo said. He said the boy's mother was absent.</p>

        <p>THE BRONX: HUMAN REMAINS FOUND  A black bag containing human remains washed up on the shore of Rikers Island yesterday, the police said. A spokeswoman for the city medical examiner said that an autopsy would be conducted today. Two weeks ago, human remains were found floating in the East River and Hudson River.</p>

        <p>CENTER MORICHES: ARREST IN ROUTE 112 BURGLARIES  A man known as the Route 112 Bandit was so brazen in his burglaries along the highway that he once interrupted a theft at the Dairy Barn in Center Moriches, posed as the manager, and made off with the cigarettes the others were trying to steal. On Tuesday, the accused man, Harry Fleischmann, 21, of Selden, pleaded not guilty to six counts of felony burglary. In one case, the police said, he rolled a safe from a building he had robbed and hailed a taxi.  Tina Kelley (NYT)</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>WEST MILFORD: BEAR HUNT OPPOSED  Several animal-protection groups and West Milford, a Passaic County town that is home to many black bears, have asked a New Jersey appeals court to block the Sept. 18 start of the state's first bear hunt since 1970. The anti-hunt coalition's lawyer, William Strazza, argued that the state's Division of Fish and Wildlife and its Fish and Game Council had exceeded their authority when they voted to allow the killing of 175 bears. Mr. Strazza also contended that the division's estimate that about 1,000 black bears were roaming the state's northwest corner, threatening public safety, was not based on scientific evidence. A spokeswoman for the division, Sharon A. Southard, declined to comment.  Robert Hanley (NYT)</p>
        <p>TRENTON: NEW YORK ADS ANGER WHITMAN  Responding yesterday to an angry letter from Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, Time Warner Cable pulled a direct-mail campaign in New York City for a technology said to be so easy that ''even somebody from New Jersey can use it.'' Mrs. Whitman received word of the offending mailing from a New Yorker, and wrote to company officials yesterday morning demanding it be discontinued, said her spokeswoman, Jayne O'Connor. By afternoon, the company agreed to halt the mailing, which was developed independently by Time Warner Cable of New York City, a subsidiary of Time Warner Cable, a spokesman for the parent company said.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: EX-MAYOR'S POVERTY PLEA DENIED  A federal judge yesterday rejected Kenneth A. Gibson's request to use public money to pay the lawyer, Cathy Fleming, who has been defending him in a $50 million fraud and bribery trial. Mr. Gibson, left, a former mayor of Newark, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he cheated the Irvington Board of Education on school construction projects between 1991 and 1995, after he had left office. After examining Mr. Gibson's finances, Judge William G. Bassler of Federal District Court turned him down, saying, ''He may not be able to afford Miss Fleming, but there's no indication he can't afford counsel.''  Andrew Jacobs (NYT)</p>
        <p>NEWARK: AIRPORT MONORAIL TO CLOSE  Passengers at Newark International Airport will have to rely on buses when the monorail system closes on Saturday for repairs that are expected to take until the end of the year. The airport, which is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, plans to have 50 buses and vans constantly ferrying passengers between parking lots, terminals and car rental areas. But travelers are being advised to allow an extra 30 minutes.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>BRIDGEPORT: INMATE HANGS HERSELF  A 41-year-old woman charged with jumping bail on drug and prostitution charges hanged herself in a police jail cell Tuesday morning, Chief Wilbur Chapman of the Bridgeport Police said. The woman, Edith Gutowski, who had a long history of arrests on such charges, hanged herself with a denim shirt about 6:30 a.m. and died Tuesday night, the chief said. Ms. Gutowski had been arrested on Saturday, and was to appear in court on Tuesday. She had skipped court appearances on two bail bonds, one for $5,000 and the other for $25,000.
