        <p>Thirty-eight people were charged yesterday in connection with racketeering schemes that prosecutors said siphoned millions of dollars from New York City construction projects and diverted it to the Lucchese family and its partners, corrupt union officials and contractors.</p>
        <p>It is the most significant case focusing on organized crime's role in the construction industry in a decade, the authorities said. The schemes involved public and private building projects, including schools, over the last two years.</p>
        <p>Among those named in an indictment were the acting boss of the Lucchese crime family and two of his senior aides, identified as Lucchese captains.</p>
        <p>The indictment announced by the Manhattan district attorney's office also charged 11 union officials, including the leader of carpenters unions long tainted by mob influence.</p>
