        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>GORE GAINS IN MISSOURI -- Thanks in part to postconvention gains among women, Vice President Al Gore has caught up with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in Missouri, a swing state in which he had been trailing. The results of the poll, conducted last Thursday and Friday for The Kansas City Star by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research, found that 45 percent of 621 registered voters favored Mr. Gore and 41 percent favored Mr. Bush, a spread that technically left the race a dead heat because the margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points. Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee, had 2 percent, and Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party had 1 percent. In a Mason-Dixon poll conducted July 6 to 10, before the Republican and Democratic conventions, Mr. Gore trailed Mr. Bush by 11 points, 48 percent to 37 percent.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>FLORIDA VOTES AS EXPECTED -- There were no surprises in Tuesday's primaries in Florida that picked Democratic and Republican candidates to compete for the Senate seat being vacated by Connie Mack, a Republican who is retiring. As expected, Representative Bill McCollum easily won the Republican primary, capturing 82 percent of the vote, and the state's insurance commissioner, Bill Nelson, coasted to a win in the Democratic primary, taking 77 percent of the vote. But the fall contest is expected to be one of the most competitive in the country. Democrats say Mr. Nelson has a real chance because Mr. McCollum, who had been counting on riding Gov. George W. Bush's coattails, no longer is assured of a good ride.</p>
        <p>In another Florida race, Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas, winning re-election, took 51.6 percent of the vote in an open primary, avoiding a runoff.</p>
        <p>In Nevada, former Representative John Ensign easily won the Republican primary for an open Senate seat. In the fall, he will face Ed Bernstein, a millionaire who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. The incumbent, Richard Bryan, a Democrat, is retiring.</p>

        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>GEORGIA RACE HEATS UP -- The race for the seat once held by Senator Paul Coverdell, the late Republican from Georgia, has been a quiet affair, with both leading candidates spending more time raising money than campaigning. Zell Miller, a Democrat, was appointed to the seat, pending a special election, after Mr. Coverdell died in July. This week Mr. Miller, a former governor, began running the first television advertisement of the campaign.</p>
        <p>''I was honored by Governor Barnes when he appointed me to fill the big shoes of my good friend Senator Coverdell,'' Mr. Miller says in the 30-second advertisement in which he courts some of the Republican voters who twice elected Mr. Coverdell over a Democrat. ''But in November, you get to decide if I should finish the last four years of his term. I pledge you this: as your senator, I will serve no single party but rather seven and one-half million Georgians.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller's opponent, former Senator Mack Mattingly, has a new campaign mailing that includes an endorsement by Mr. Coverdell's widow, Nancy.</p>

        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>ANOTHER DEBATE, ANOTHER DISPUTE -- As the spat over the presidential debates plays out, House and Senate Democratic leaders are churning up their own debate controversy. Several months ago, the two leaders -- Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senator Thomas Daschle of South Dakota -- challenged Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, the Republican House leader, and Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, to a debate on ''The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'' on Oct. 15. The Republicans said they were too busy and could not plan that far ahead. Yesterday, Mr. Gephardt wrote to Mr. Hastert, saying he was disappointed that Mr. Hastert would not participate in a discussion of campaign issues.</p>
        <p>''Given Governor Bush's refusal to participate in the three debates proposed by the Commission on Presidential Debates, your refusal raises questions about whether the leaders of the Republican Party really want any honest discussion of the issues this year,'' Mr. Gephardt wrote. John Feehery, Mr. Hastert's press secretary, said Mr. Hastert was busy doing his job. ''He is a legislator, not a debater,'' Mr. Feehery said.</p>
