        <p>In back-to-back sessions this evening, President Clinton met with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and then the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, to salvage the progress made in peace talks last month, but afterward the White House said there was little movement.</p>
        <p>The president's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that, as expected, ''no breakthrough'' was achieved. ''But the process is not broken down, it is ongoing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The mood was downbeat, after Mr. Clinton met with the leaders in the upper floors of the Waldorf-Astoria in a kind of hasty urban reprise of the bucolic Camp David talks six weeks ago. To build pressure on the leaders, the secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, met with Mr. Arafat as he waited for Mr. Barak to finish with the president, and she also met with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia before he sat down with Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart said the president had reviewed possible compromises with the leaders on the main issues, including the future status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees, but he declined to give details.  The session with Mr. Barak lasted less than an hour, and the meeting with Mr. Arafat, with whom the Americans feel they need to do the most work, lasted about 90 minutes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart said there were no proposals tonight for the next steps in the process. ''I don't want to say there is no hope for next steps -- I don't know what it is,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Last week, administration officials said that once today's highly anticipated meetings were over, the president would be assessing whether it would be worthwhile to bring the leaders together again in another meeting in the manner of the Camp David meeting. They said this would be done only if the leaders were close to signing an agreement.</p>
        <p>With a full array of world leaders in town, the White House seemed to be seeking out Arab leaders in particular in their effort to convince Mr. Arafat that time was running out for a peace agreement. Mr. Clinton met with Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia after his session with Mr. Arafat,  and earlier Dr. Albright spoke with the Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa.</p>
        <p>At the United Nations, both Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat spoke from the rostrum of the General Assembly, stating fairly familiar positions that included more generous terms than in the past.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak called Jerusalem ''the eternal capital of Israel'' and then went on to say, ''We recognize that Jerusalem is also sacred to Muslims and Christians the world over, and cherished by our Palestinian neighbors.'' He also stressed the short timetable, which the United States believes is framed by the return of the Israeli Parliament at the end of October. Mr. Barak has only a one-vote majority in the Parliament and faces the likelihood of having to call an election. Without a peace agreement, it would be an election he could well lose. ''History will judge what we do in the next days and weeks,'' Mr. Barak said.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Arafat said, ''We remain committed to our national rights over East Jerusalem, capital of our state and shelter of our sacred sites, as well as our rights on the Christian and Islamic holy sites, maintaining that the city should be accessible to all, and open onto its western side.''</p>
        <p>In a reflection of the touch-and-go dynamics of the peace effort, a senior administration official said before Mr. Clinton's meetings today that the positions of the parties had slipped some since Camp David.</p>
        <p>There had been some ''forward movement'' in some areas, but in other areas, ''I would say that they haven't necessarily stayed exactly where they were,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration said that at Camp David considerable headway had been made on subjects that had been taboo, particularly the future of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>But the senior administration official said that ''it's been hard to build on the advances that were made.''</p>
        <p>A senior Palestinian official, Saeb Erekat, who had been quite optimistic after Camp David, said that more than two dozen meetings between the two sides in the last six weeks had produced little.</p>
        <p>White House officials said they expected Mr. Arafat to return home this weekend to meet with the Palestinian Central Council, where a decision would be made on whether to declare a Palestinian state. Palestinian officials have indicated that rather than declare a state on Sept. 13, as they had pledged, November or even later might be set as a new date. Some European and Islamic nations have encouraged Mr. Arafat to delay his declaration of a state and concentrate on a peace settlement with Israel.</p>
