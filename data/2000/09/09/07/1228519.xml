        <p>The DaimlerChrysler Group unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. -- known as the Chrysler Corporation before being acquired by Daimler-Benz -- said unexpectedly last night that it would begin a review on accounts with billings estimated at $1.2 billion. The assignments, now divided between two agencies, may be consolidated at a single shop.</p>
        <p>The accounts under review are national and regional dealer creative assignments for the Dodge brand, handled by BBDO Detroit in Southfield, Mich., part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, and three assignments handled by the Southfield office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications: the worldwide Chrysler and Jeep brand accounts and the worldwide corporate brand account for the DaimlerChrysler Group.</p>

        <p>The DaimlerChrysler Group unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. -- known as the Chrysler Corporation before being acquired by Daimler-Benz -- said unexpectedly last night that it would begin a review on accounts with billings estimated at $1.2 billion. The assignments, now divided between two agencies, may be consolidated at a single shop.</p>
        <p>The accounts under review are national and regional dealer creative assignments for the Dodge brand, handled by BBDO Detroit in Southfield, Mich., part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, and three assignments handled by the Southfield office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications: the worldwide Chrysler and Jeep brand accounts and the worldwide corporate brand account for the DaimlerChrysler Group.</p>
        <p>''This is all about efficiencies, not about creative product or capability,'' Arthur C. Liebler, senior vice president for Chrysler Group Marketing at the DaimlerChrysler Group in Auburn Hills, Mich., said in a statement. ''We are in ongoing discussions with our major agency partners to determine additional ways to drive costs out of our system.''</p>
        <p>''We are undecided at this early stage what that final structure will be,'' he added, ''but it could ultimately lead to one primary agency for all Dodge, Chrysler and Jeep brand and corporate advertising.'' A decision is expected during the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Assignments not involved in the review include the DaimlerChrysler Group media planning and buying, handled by PentaCom in Troy, Mich., part of Omnicom; the American creative account of Mercedes-Benz, handled by Merkley Newman Harty in New York, also part of Omnicom; the creative duties for work aimed at minority groups; and customer relationship marketing.</p>
        <p>FCB has worked for DaimlerChrysler since September 1999, when True North shifted many accounts to FCB from a sibling, Bozell Worldwide. Bozell had worked for Chrysler since 1979, when Lee A. Iacocca hired a Bozell predecessor, Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt. BBDO has handled the Dodge assignment since 1960.</p>
