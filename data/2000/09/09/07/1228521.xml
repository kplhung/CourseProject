        <p>Two top officials at Hong Kong University resigned today after an investigation found that they and an adviser to the territory's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, had pressed a prominent pollster not to publish surveys critical of Mr. Tung.</p>
        <p>The university's vice chancellor, Cheng Yiu-chung, and his deputy, Wong Siu-lung, are the first casualties of a dispute that has become a referendum on whether Hong Kong's government has sought to stifle academic freedom since the British colony reverted to China in 1997.</p>
        <p>The two men said they rejected the findings of the investigation, which had been ordered by the university after the pollster, Robert Chung, made the allegations in July. But they said they would step down to avoid damage to the institution.</p>
        <p>The report also implicated Mr. Tung's senior special adviser, Andrew Lo. He refused to step down, saying he had not sought to intimidate Mr. Chung. Mr. Lo has been stoutly defended by Mr. Tung, but with the drumbeat of opposition, Mr. Tung may be forced to jettison Mr. Lo, one of his most trusted advisers.</p>
        <p>The dispute has injected a combustible element into Hong Kong's legislative elections, which will be held Sunday. In the first post-colonial ballot, in 1998, voters were driven by fears that China would curtail Hong Kong's freedoms. This time, people are likely to signal their dissatisfaction with their own Beijing-appointed leaders.</p>
        <p>''The scandal damages the credibility and image of the local government,'' said Tsang Yok-sing, the chairman of the main pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong. ''We are seen as close to Mr. Tung, so we will suffer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsang predicted that his party would lose at least one of the 24 seats in the Legislative Council that are chosen through direct elections. The other 36 seats are filled by indirect means that favor pro-Beijing interests.</p>
        <p>''Hong Kong voters are not electing a government,'' said Martin Lee, chairman of the Democratic Party. ''They are electing legislators, who are always going to be in opposition.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chung's allegation -- that the university had threatened to ''dry up'' his funding if he did not end polls on Mr. Tung's popularity -- prompted a blizzard of criticism.</p>
        <p>The university appointed an independent panel to investigate the allegations. After 11 days of hearings, broadcast live on television, the panel issued a damning report last week.</p>
        <p>It said that after a meeting between the vice chancellor and Mr. Tung's aide, the deputy vice chancellor delivered a message to Mr. Chung ''which was calculated to inhibit his right to academic freedom.'' The panel described Mr. Tung's adviser, Mr. Lo, as a ''poor and untruthful witness.''</p>
        <p>The panel found no evidence that Mr. Tung ordered Mr. Lo to stop the polls. Mr. Tung himself declined to testify. But Mr. Chung and many others say the chief executive signaled his displeasure with the surveys -- which led Mr. Lo to take matters into his own hands.</p>
        <p>''One of the issues in Hong Kong after the handover has been the lack of accountability,'' said Michael DeGolyer, head of the Hong Kong Transition Project, which measures post-colonial attitudes. For that reason, he added, the public airing of the dispute would have a salutory effect. Given Hong Kong's awkward political situation as a semi-democratic oasis in a Communist country, he said, people here should be highly alert to any threats.</p>
