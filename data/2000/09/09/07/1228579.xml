        <p>Unveiling a book-length plan that hinges on optimistic fiscal forecasts, Vice President Al Gore today offered his economic vision for the future, painting an image of a prosperous middle class that enjoys higher incomes, with more home ownership, more high-tech jobs and more people going to college.</p>
        <p>''My cause is hard-working, middle-class families,'' he declared at the start of his speech here today at Cleveland State University.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore outlined a series of social and economic goals that he said were attainable given the nation's current prosperity, and he presented a mountain of supporting detail that his campaign hopes will make Gov. George W. Bush's financial plan pale in comparison.</p>
        <p>The speech reflected a shift in language and approach for Mr. Gore, who has in recent days replaced the ''working families'' he courted so assiduously during the Democratic National Convention last month with ''middle-class'' families.</p>
        <p>''The Gore-Lieberman economic plan,'' he said, ''has one guiding purpose: to help the middle-class families who have always been America's purpose and pride, the people who pay the taxes, bear the burdens and live the American dream.''</p>
        <p>In his convention speech Mr. Gore used the phrase ''working families'' nine times. In today's speech, , he used ''middle-class'' 12 times and ''working families'' only once.</p>
        <p>The release of Mr. Gore's economic blueprint reignited a debate with Mr. Bush over whose plan can best manage the projected budget surplus over the next decade without ruining the economy. [News Analysis, Page A26.]</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush wasted little time yesterday attacking the plan, saying Mr. Gore had made so many spending promises that he would eat through the surplus.</p>
        <p>To deflect such perceptions, Mr. Gore included in his glossy, 191-page plan a pledge to set aside $300 billion as a hedge against overly optimistic fiscal projections. Aside from the rainy day fund, Mr. Gore's plan is largely a synthesis of many specific programs he has described over the last several months. But today was the first time the vice president had drawn all of these stray threads together into a broader theme.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said his 10 goals were to: eliminate the debt by 2012; protect the Social Security and Medicare surpluses; double the number of families that have more than $50,000 in savings; reduce income taxes on the typical family to the lowest level in 50 years; raise family income by a third over the next decade; enable seven in ten families to own their own homes; increase the number of people who go to college; reduce poverty to below 10 percent for the first time since poverty statistics were kept in 1959 (it was 12.7 percent in 1998); cut the gap between wages earned by men and women; and create 10 million new high-tech jobs.</p>
        <p>Some aspects of the plan beget others. For example, eliminating the debt by 2012 would reduce interest rates and thus make school loans more affordable so that more people could attend college.</p>
        <p>The economic blueprint that Mr. Gore offered today is a road map of middle-class life. It envisions expanded income in continuing boom times, with more people going to college and working in well-paying, high-tech jobs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's focus on the middle class is something of a turn away from the more combative populist language he has relied on for weeks. It reflects, in part, the arrival of a new pollster, Stanley Greenberg, who has written extensively about the middle class and helped Bill Clinton capture that broad swath of voters in 1992.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers said he had deliberately used the phrase ''middle class'' in this speech because he was also talking about reducing the number of people in poverty and wanted to distinguish between the two.</p>
        <p>But the vice president has been using the term ''middle class'' in speeches for days now, and has been losing ''working families.'' The plan  he distributed today was titled ''Prosperity for America's Families.''</p>
        <p>Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who at one time advised Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, on word choice and language, said that Mr. Gore appeared to have moved deliberately away from ''working families'' to the ''middle class'' to broaden his reach. Mr. Luntz said that voters perceived ''working families'' as applying to young couples and excluding people who were retired or about to retire. This is a huge block of voters who are especially important because they tend to go to the polls in larger numbers than younger people.</p>
        <p>''The battleground in this election is for the 30-somethings and the near-retirees,'' Mr. Luntz said.</p>
        <p>He said focus groups with voters he has conducted for MSNBC have found that the phrase ''working families'' was working against Mr. Gore, not only because of its connotations of youth, but also because of its suggestion of class distinctions that Americans are loath to acknowledge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's plan, particularly the goal of raising family income by a  third over the next decade, assumes an annual growth rate in incomes of 2.9 percent -- a fairly ambitious goal,  although the most recent figures available show that from 1997 to 1998, median family income grew 3.3 percent, to $46,737 from $45,262. Mr. Gore's budget advisers acknowledged that the country had never sustained such growth over a 10-year period.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore told his audience to ''read my plan,'' a pointed reference to the infamous pronouncement by former President George Bush, father of Mr. Gore's current rival, who told voters, ''Read my lips: no new taxes.''</p>
        <p>''My plan wasn't built on cross-your-fingers economics that says we can give more to the people who already have the most and then just hope the benefits trickle down to the middle class,'' Mr. Gore said, again contrasting himself with the Reagan-Bush era.</p>
        <p>To demonstrate a fiscally conservative approach, Mr. Gore said his $300 billion rainy-day fund would be a hedge against overly optimistic surplus projections.</p>
        <p>''If today's economic forecasts fall short, this new reserve fund will guarantee that we will not have to cut education or health care,'' Mr. Gore said. ''And unlike the promises made on the other side, we won't be running deficits and endangering America's prosperity.''</p>
        <p>Robert D. Reischauer, President Clinton's former director of the Office of Management and Budget -- now an analyst with the Urban Institute -- said the plan, especially the rainy-day fund, was ''fiscally prudent and politically sound.''</p>
        <p>He said that Mr. Gore's goals would essentially ''fall in his lap'' if the economy continued its expansion, and that these goals appealed to most voters.</p>
        <p>''The vast majority of people view themselves as middle class,'' he said. ''Those who are not in the middle class have aspirations to be there, and they view those aspirations as realistic, so you don't offend anybody.''</p>
        <p>In His Own Words  AL GORE</p>
        <p>Remarks prepared for delivery yesterday at Cleveland State University about his economic plans.</p>
        <p>''I propose to take 1 out of every 6 dollars of the budget surplus, and put it aside. So it will not be used for new spending. It will not be used for new tax cuts. It will not be spent on promises or proposals of any kind.</p>
        <p>So if today's economic forecasts fall short, this new reserve fund will guarantee that we will not have to cut education or health care. And unlike the promises made on the other side, we won't be running deficits and endangering America's prosperity.</p>
        <p>If you entrust me with the presidency, I will make sure the resources are there to invest in our families and build a more prosperous future. . . .</p>
        <p>I'm fighting for a full range of targeted tax cuts for middle-class families. To help you save for college and retirement. To pay for health insurance and child care. To reform the estate tax, so  people can pass on a small business or a family farm. And to end the marriage penalty -- the right way, the fair way. . . .</p>
        <p>Taken together, these middle-class tax cuts will bring the typical family's tax burden to its lowest level in 50 years.</p>
        <p>But let me say it plainly: I will not go along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process.''</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT  Correction:  September 9, 2000, Saturday  A front-page article on Thursday about Vice President Al Gore's economic plan misstated the title of Robert D.
