        <p>There are enough subplots here to fuel a prime-time soap opera, enough tightly wound coaches to require a stress-management clinic, enough thinly veiled salvos to mandate a flak jacket.</p>
        <p>The Jets (1-0) and the Patriots (0-1) play Monday night and, as usual, you need an updated roster -- and a flow chart of bruised relationships -- to keep up.</p>
        <p>Even with Bill Parcells ensconced in the Jets' front office, his presence, in the form of his disciples and the players he has coached in both cities, hovers over this rivalry like a puppeteer with full control of the strings.</p>
        <p>When Parcells and his nemesis, the New England owner, Robert Kraft, negotiated the settlement that paved the way for Bill Belichick -- who, in his famously scribbled note, resigned as 'H.C. of the N.Y. Jets' after just one day on the job in January -- to become the Patriots' head coach, Parcells declared that the border war between the Patriots and the Jets was over. It was an optimistic assertion.</p>
        <p>''Heck no, no way; it's just beginning,'' said quarterback Ray Lucas, who, like dozens of others, has links to both franchises.</p>
        <p>The week began with Jets Coach Al Groh, who coached with Belichick with the Giants, the Browns, the Patriots and the Jets, delivering an unsolicited verbal hug of his new defensive coordinator Mike Nolan.</p>
        <p>Nolan is in the difficult position of having to learn a defense masterminded by Belichick, about whom the Jets' defensive players still speak with reverence. Groh said that Nolan didn't ''fall into the genius syndrome,'' because he didn't overcoach when things weren't going well during a game. ''Genius,'' of course, is the tag attached to Belichick, who is renowned for his defensive adjustments and who has overshadowed Groh everywhere they coached together.</p>
        <p>Was Groh taking a shot at Belichick, without whose indecision in January Groh would not be the coach of the Jets today?</p>
        <p>Groh revealed a rare flash of pique today at that suggestion.</p>
        <p>''For those people who want to be amateur psychiatrists, and who want to analyze my relationships and my motives, and misrepresent them to the world, sometimes you don't have a hint of what you're saying,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''At this time next week, all anybody is going to want to talk about is football,'' Groh said. All anybody wanted to talk about now, Groh added with the use of some salty language, was other stuff.</p>
        <p>The backdrop to this game feels like fiction. Parcells had a messy divorce from New England, and took Belichick and Groh with him. Then, he had his staff craft a highly creative contract that lured running back Curtis Martin away from the Patriots. When Belichick left -- ostensibly because he was worried about the Jets' uncertain ownership situation -- he took Charlie Weis, the Jets' offensive coordinator and a Parcells protege who testified against Parcells and the Jets in Belichick's initial bid to escape his Jets contract.</p>
        <p>Belichick also took along the personnel man Scott Pioli who, in a nifty twist, is married to Parcells's daughter. And there have been innumerable players and coaches going between the two teams.</p>
        <p>Today, Belichick took a swipe at Parcells. They have spoken just a few times since their split. When asked if Parcells may have lost track of the clock and the score at the end of last year's season-opening loss to the Patriots, Belichick responded with the zinger: 'I remember the situation. It was a long time ago. Everybody makes mistakes. I'll take the high road.'</p>
        <p>Today, Groh tried to put a happy face on his relationship with Belichick, and suggested that the heat that comes from this game twice a year is a byproduct of the regional rivalry spawned by the trade of Babe Ruth to the Yankees and exacerbated by Mookie Wilson's grounder through Bill Buckner's legs in the 1986 World Series.</p>
        <p>''Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick, the two of them together were responsible for my coming into the league,'' Groh said. ''They taught me those things I needed to know.''</p>
        <p>Groh is almost in a supporting role in this melodrama, with Belichick and Parcells taking center stage in a game that will be played in prime time for the fourth time in the four seasons since Parcells left Foxboro, Mass. Today, Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe credited Belichick with instituting a level of discipline that had been lost after Parcells left.</p>
        <p>But if Belichick earns praise in New England, he elicits much more mixed emotions here. Most of the Jets' defensive players remain almost slavishly devoted to him and call him the best coach they have ever played for. Still, they were jilted when Belichick bolted.</p>
        <p>''I took it a little personally, thinking this was going to be the head coach,'' safety Victor Green said.</p>
        <p>''The main emotion I'll feel is walking into Giants Stadium,'' said Belichick, who helped Parcells win two Super Bowls with the Giants. ''I coached there for 15 years. I remember a lot of games and a lot of big moments and I can't say that about any other stadium.''</p>
        <p>''I'm very happy things worked out the way they did for me,'' he added. ''I don't have any leftover feelings.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Jets signed wide receiver-kick returner DAMON DUNN and waived the first-year tackle CORNELL GREEN. Dunn will be looked at for punt and kickoff returns.</p>
