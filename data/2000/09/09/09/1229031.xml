        <p>Canada's unemployment rate rose to 7.1 percent in August from 6.8 percent in July and 6.6 percent in June, a surprising trend that has raised concerns about the strength of the economy. An estimated 27,000 jobs were added in August, but more than three times as many people joined the work force. The influx of job seekers was a sign of confidence, economists said. But they noted that the number of new jobs in August did not make up for the 31,000 lost in June and July -- and that last month's additions were mostly part-time jobs.</p>
