        <p>The $6.3 million verdict against the Aryan Nations, the white supremacist group, and its leader Richard Butler may well put the organization out of business. The defendants argue they should not be punished for their racist and anti-Semitic ideology. But this case was not about free speech or the right to hold odious views, which the First Amendment protects. It was about holding an organization responsible for assaults committed by its security guards.</p>
        <p>The verdict of an Idaho jury sends a strong message that hate groups will be held financially liable for the violence they commit. It was properly about compensating victims who had been terrorized and injured by the Aryan Nations's security guards.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan and her son Jason Keenan, were attacked by the guards after they stopped their car on a road near the entrance to the Aryan Nations compound to retrieve a wallet that had fallen out of the car. The guards thought the Keenans were Jewish agents sent to attack the compound. They got into a truck, chased the car, shot at it with an assault weapon, forced it into a ditch, and then surrounded and physically beat the Keenans. The guards were drunk at the time.</p>
        <p>Two of the guards are now in prison for assault, and a third is a fugitive. The lawsuit by the Keenans, who were represented by lawyers with the Southern Poverty Law Center, charged the Aryan Nations and Mr. Butler with negligence and recklessness in training and supervising the guards. The jury awarded the plaintiffs $330,000 in compensatory damages and $6 million in punitive damages, with the bulk of that amount to be paid by Mr. Butler and the organization.</p>
        <p>The law center has sued other hate groups for violent acts committed by their members. The purpose is to shut down groups that engage in conspiracies or aid and abet violence. In 1990 the center brought a civil suit on behalf of a black man who was killed by neo-Nazi skinheads in Portland, Ore. A jury in that case awarded the man's family $12.5 million against the skinheads and the White Aryan Resistance, a white supremacist group that recruited and trained skinheads.</p>
        <p>While free-speech issues are inevitably raised in these cases, the Constitution is not violated when verdicts are rendered to punish conduct and not speech. Clearly, if a supermarket had hired drunken guards who shot at innocent passers-by, it would be liable for the conduct of its employees, and may even be put out of business by a large verdict. The same applies in this case. The fact that the Aryan Nations and its members are motivated by a political ideology does not shield them from liability to injured parties.</p>
