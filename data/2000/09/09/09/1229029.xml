        <p>Officials at the European Commission said yesterday that America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc. had proposed concessions in their attempt to overcome European antitrust objections to their merger. A spokeswoman for Mario Monti, Europe's commissioner in charge of competition affairs, said there had been concessions. European officials refused to say what the proposed concessions were or whether they would be sufficient. But industry executives thought AOL might have offered to strengthen its earlier proposal to limit its ties to Bertelsmann A.G., the German media company.</p>
