        <p>A decade ago, Pete Sampras was a California teenager about to barge into sports history. A record 13 Grand Slam titles later, Sampras has returned to the site of his tennis breakthrough a different man, having reached a different place: happiness, and comfort.</p>
        <p>''I've done a lot more than I ever thought I would in the game,'' Sampras said. ''You know, at this point, I'm just trying to add on to what I have already.''</p>
        <p>He deflated the pressure he had been facing by breaking the Grand Slam record at Wimbledon. He is engaged to the actress Bridgette Wilson. And he is in the semifinals of the United States Open, arriving healthy and relaxed, having thrown off a minor scare in the quarterfinals against Richard Krajicek with uncanny shots and unwavering confidence.</p>
        <p>''The best players are able to play every point, and when they do that, they are able to go to another gear,'' said Sampras's coach, Paul Annacone. ''That's what he does. It's just an innate belief that he's supposed to win.''</p>
        <p>That assessment gets a nod of agreement from Todd Martin, Sampras's fellow semifinalist and a tour veteran. ''That's why Pete's better than everybody else,'' Martin said. ''Even now, I still think he's the best player. It's because he does the right thing when he needs to. He can go out and play a bad match, but he does the right thing when he needs to.''</p>
        <p>Sampras has set a nearly impossible standard for the other three semifinalists, who are all hoping to make this their first Grand Slam title.</p>
        <p>Martin, the runner-up to Andre Agassi last year at this event, is the 30-year-old veteran looking to climb the final steps to a career peak. While he and Sampras, 29, have drawn confidence from their perseverance as much as their success, their opponents enter their first Grand Slam semifinal with a different sense: excitement and innocence, with both of them hoping to begin their legacies.</p>
        <p>Sampras plays ninth-seeded Lleyton Hewitt, a 19-year-old Australian whose surging resume includes a grass-court victory over Sampras in June. ''He's one of the guys that's going to be the future of the game,'' Sampras said.</p>
        <p>Another piece of the future is 20-year-old Marat Safin, the sixth-seeded Russian baseliner who plays Martin in today's first semifinal. Safin, just two inches shorter than Martin at 6 feet 4 inches, is prone to lapses of concentration and fiery outbursts at himself, two traits that reveal the impatience of youth. ''But he hits the ball much better than I ever dreamt of hitting,'' Martin said.</p>
        <p>Safin and Martin have never played each other, but they have left similar tread marks on the court at this tournament. Safin has played 200 games and four tie breakers, including consecutive five-set matches. Martin, after his dramatic five-set comeback against Carlos Moya in the fourth round, returned against Thomas Johansson in the quarterfinals and dragged his body to victory.</p>
        <p>''It has taken its toll,'' Martin admitted yesterday after an hour of treatment. He will rely on his mental strength this afternoon against Safin.</p>
        <p>''He's one of the few guys who can overpower anybody out there,'' Martin said. ''It's a matter of how long you let that overpowering occur. I've got to mix it up.'' Martin summed up any advantage he might have this way: ''Knowledge of the game. The ability to keep my composure on court.</p>
        <p>Safin, for his part, was wary of the veteran American. ''He's a big fighter, has a good serve,'' Safin said. ''It's a lot of headache because he's a big serve, no rhythm at all. It's a different game, which I don't like.''</p>
        <p>Sampras is wary of Hewitt's game, too, praising the Australian's quick footwork, which enabled Hewitt to claim his first victory in four attempts over Sampras in June. ''A win's a win,'' Sampras said. ''He beat me and that was a tough hurdle. It's a different situation and a different surface now. Still, he's serving better and he's real fired up.''</p>
        <p>In his own way, so is Sampras. Unlike at Wimbledon, when tendinitis in his left shin kept him from practicing throughout the tournament, Sampras has been able to practice consistently. ''I feel much better than Wimbledon,'' Sampras said.</p>
        <p>Winning 13 Grand Slam titles will do that, Annacone said. ''He's always told me that if he wins one major a year, it's a good year,'' Annacone said. ''He won one major and he broke the record, so it's a matter of having fun and just enjoying now. I believe it should free him up to play his best tennis.''</p>
        <p>Sampras does not want to make any predictions about youth versus experience, but he knows his legacy is not completed. ''Since I'm reasonably young and healthy, got the game, I might as well take advantage of it and try to make it 14,'' he said.</p>
