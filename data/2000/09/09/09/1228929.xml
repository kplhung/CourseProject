        <p>SRI LANKA: CENSORSHIP EASED  With a general election due next month, the government has temporarily eased some of its restrictions on the news media and the holding of public meetings. Only war news will still face the heavy censorship put in place by President Chandrika Kumaratunga. Under her rules, virtually any criticism of the government was illegal.</p>

        <p>KYRGYZSTAN: ANTI-TERRORISM ACCORD  The interior ministers of 11 former Soviet states meeting in Kyrgyzstan agreed to work together to combat militant Islamic groups that have been attacking southern Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. The ministers approved an anti-terrorism program through 2003. ''Terrorism and extremism are common problems for post-Communist countries and we have come to the opinion that such problems are easier to solve through joint efforts,'' said Russia's first deputy interior minister, Valery Federov.</p>

        <p>JAPAN: NAVY OFFICER HELD AS SPY  The police arrested a senior Japanese naval officer suspected of passing secrets to a Russian Embassy official -- a move that comes just three days after Japan and Russia pledged to cooperate in regional security. The 38-year-old officer, Lt. Cmdr. Shigehiro Hagisaki, left, a researcher at the National Institute for Defense Studies, is accused of giving classified documents to a Russian military attache in Tokyo on several occasions.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: NEW ACEH VIOLENCE  At least 12 people, including three police officers, were killed in an upsurge of violence in Aceh Province, the police and rebels said. The officers were shot when about 10 gunmen attacked a police van in central Aceh. Separatists in Aceh, a province rich in gas and oil deposits, have been fighting since 1975 for independence from Indonesia. At least 5,000 people have been killed in the past decade.</p>

        <p>CHINA: MEDITATION GROUP'S ASSETS SEIZED  Authorities in northern China have confiscated assets worth millions of dollars from a banned meditation group, including schools, businesses and a sanitarium, a rights group based in Hong Kong said. Shaanxi Province's government appropriated 123 Zhong Gong properties and land worth $36.5 million, the Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said. China cracked down on Zhong Gong soon after banning the better-known Falun Gong sect in July 1999.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: OIL PRICE REBATE  With oil prices at their highest levels in a decade, Ralph Klein, premier of Alberta, Canada's largest oil-producing province, has announced that his government will mail each taxpayer two rebate checks for $100, one in November and one in April. Noting that his province is to take in a record $5.7 billion from oil and gas royalties, Mr. Klein challenged other oil-rich jurisdictions in North America, like Texas, to follow his lead.</p>

        <p>ECUADOR: DOLLAR DAY  Hit by political and economic disorder for years, Ecuador completes a six-month transition to making the United States dollar its official currency at midnight tonight. Ecuador will join Panama and nine other countries in which the dollar is legal tender. Officials hope the switchover will end record inflation, now running at 104 percent a year, Latin America's highest. The step is intended to prevent the government from printing money to meet its budgetary needs.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>CYPRUS: WARNING ON TALKS  Britain's envoy to Cyprus said both sides on the divided island were poised to break new ground at United Nations-brokered talks in New York City next week, but he warned against expecting a quick breakthrough. Sir David Hannay called the talks a ''long and complex and difficult process'' but said three previous rounds had made it ''quite realistic to hope for progress.'' Cyprus has been partitioned since 1974, when Turkey occupied northern Cyprus after a coup engineered by the junta then ruling Greece.</p>

        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: FREEDOM FOR 11,000  In a move to reduce crowding in the country's prisons, the ministry of corrections plans to release about 11,000 people accused of petty crimes who have been unable to make bail while awaiting trial. The prison system, which has been plagued by escapes and mismanagement, has a capacity of about 100,000 inmates but has been holding as many as 170,000 in recent months.</p>

        <p>ETHIOPIA: AID PLEA  Ethiopia appealed for its mainly Western donors to release over $1 billion in frozen development aid that was suspended during Ethiopia's violent border war with Eritrea. The two countries signed a cease-fire in June, and Ethiopian officials said the aid money should be unblocked.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: TROOP CUT PROPOSED  Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev, left, said a high-level decision had been made to reduce the size of the armed forces by about 30 percent, or 350,000 troops, in the next three years. ''Decisions to that effect have been made and proposals on how to proceed are being drafted for the president,'' Mr. Sergeyev said, according to the news agency Interfax. Last month President Vladimir V. Putin pressed his commanders for a major restructuring of the 1.2 million-member armed forces.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: BASQUE CRACKDOWN PLANNED  The cabinet approved measures to crack down on separatist violence in the Basque region. Under the proposed laws, which require Parliament's approval, youths engaged in separatist street violence would be tried as adults and subject to longer sentences. In addition, trials of terrorist suspects would be held in Madrid instead of in the Basque region.</p>
