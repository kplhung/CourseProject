        <p>Following are excerpts from the United Nations Millennium Declaration from the General Assembly:</p>
        <p>We believe that the central challenge we face today is to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world's people. For while globalization offers great opportunities, at present its benefits are very unevenly shared, while its costs are unevenly distributed.</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from the United Nations Millennium Declaration from the General Assembly:</p>
        <p>We believe that the central challenge we face today is to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world's people. For while globalization offers great opportunities, at present its benefits are very unevenly shared, while its costs are unevenly distributed.</p>
        <p>We recognize that developing countries and countries with economies in transition face special difficulties in responding to this central challenge.</p>
        <p>Thus, only through broad and sustained efforts to create a shared future, based upon our common humanity in all its diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable. These efforts must include policies and measures, at the global level, which correspond to the needs of developing countries and economies in transition, and are formulated and implemented with their effective participation.</p>
        <p>We consider certain fundamental values to be essential to international relations in the 21st century. These include:</p>
        <p>FREEDOM -- Men and women have the right to live their lives and raise their children in dignity, free from hunger and from the fear of violence, oppression or injustice. Democratic and participatory governance based on the will of the people best assures these rights.</p>
        <p>EQUALITY -- No individual and no nation must be denied the opportunity to benefit from development. The equal rights and opportunities of women and men must be assured.</p>
        <p>SOLIDARITY -- Global challenges must be managed in a way that distributes  the costs and burdens fairly in accordance with basic principles of equity and social justice. Those who suffer, or who benefit least, deserve help from those who benefit most.</p>
        <p>TOLERANCE -- Human beings must respect each other, in all their diversity of belief, culture and language. Differences within and between societies should neither be feared nor repressed, but cherished as a precious asset of humanity. A culture of peace and dialogue among all civilizations should be actively promoted.</p>
        <p>RESPECT FOR NATURE -- Prudence must be shown in the management of all living species and natural resources, in accordance with the precepts of sustainable development. Only in this way can the immeasurable riches provided to us by nature be preserved and passed on to our descendants. The current unsustainable patterns of production and consumption must be changed, in the interest of our future welfare and that of our descendants.</p>
        <p>SHARED RESPONSIBILITY -- Responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social development, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be shared among the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally. As the most universal and most representative organization in the word, the United Nations must play the central role. . . .</p>
        <p>We resolve further:</p>
        <p>*To halve, by the year 2015, the proportion of the world's people whose income is less than $1 a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger; and also, by the same date, to halve the proportion of people who are unable to reach, or to afford, safe drinking water.</p>
        <p>*To ensure that, by the same date, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling; and that girls and boys will have equal access to all levels of education.</p>
        <p>*By the same date, to have reduced maternal mortality by three-quarters, and under-5 child mortality by two-thirds, of their current rates.</p>
        <p>*To have by then halted -- and begun to reverse -- the spread of H.I.V./AIDS, the scourge of malaria and other major diseases that afflict humanity.</p>
        <p>*To provide special assistance to children orphaned by H.I.V./AIDS.</p>
        <p>*By 2020, to have achieved a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers as proposed in the ''Cities Without Slums'' initiative.</p>
        <p>We also resolve:</p>
        <p>*To promote gender equality and the empowerment of women, as effective ways to combat poverty, hunger and disease and to stimulate development that is truly sustainable.</p>
        <p>*To develop and implement strategies that give young people everywhere a real chance to find decent and productive work.</p>
        <p>*To encourage the pharmaceutical industry to make essential drugs more widely available and affordable by all who need them in developing countries.</p>
        <p>*To develop strong partnerships with the private sector, and with civil society organizations, in pursuit of development and poverty eradication.</p>
