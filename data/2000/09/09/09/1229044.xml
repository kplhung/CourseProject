        <p>Ellen Lehman really wanted Rick Lazio to be her man.

        <p>Ellen Lehman really wanted Rick Lazio to be her man. Though she identifies herself as a Democrat at heart, Ms. Lehman said she was fed up with the Clintons and hoped that Mr. Lazio, the young Republican congressman with the nice family, would be the one to represent her in the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>''I thought anyone would be better than Hillary,'' said Ms. Lehman, 56, a  retired data entry operator sitting in front of a faded brownstone in downtown Troy. But as she learned more about Mr. Lazio, mostly from newspaper articles and television ads, she decided she did not like him much, either. ''Now I'm going to vote for Hillary, which I never thought would happen.''</p>
        <p>Many voters in this small, industrial city on the Hudson River, just north of Albany, are struggling to hold down jobs and raise families in aging neighborhoods. They say they view politics as the means to improve their lives, but do not necessarily stick with a particular party or candidate. Along with the 7,500 registered Democrats and 5,300 Republicans in Troy, there are 9,500 voters who are independent or have not declared a party affiliation.</p>
        <p>In the last Senate race, in 1998, Troy gave Charles E. Schumer, the Democrat, about 50 percent of its vote, and the Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato, 48 percent. But this was offset by the rest of Rensselaer County, where there is a stronger Republican tradition (26,900 registered Republicans, 23,800 Democrats). In the county as a whole, Mr. D'Amato received 52 percent of the vote and Mr. Schumer, 46 percent.</p>
        <p>Whatever their politics, voters in Troy said they wanted tax cuts, health care improvements and an infusion of money for public schools and redevelopment projects. But in conversations on sidewalks, at bus stops and inside one cozy diner, they were more likely to cite the shortcomings of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. Lazio than any of their policy initiatives.</p>
        <p>As upstaters, they remain deeply suspicious of Mr. Lazio, from Suffolk County on Long Island, and even more so of Mrs. Clinton, who moved to Westchester County just before she formally announced that she would run for office. They question whether either candidate truly grasps the needs of a city that was literally broke five years ago. Times are better now, but Troy is hardly the thriving manufacturing center it was in its heyday in the 1800's.</p>
        <p>Though some voters are still withholding judgment, Ms. Lehman and others have already decided to vote for the candidate who seems least offensive to them in a race that has been rife with hostility. In recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio have sought to take the high ground while accusing each other of underhanded campaigning and at the same time firing off a new round of inflammatory charges.</p>
        <p>But in and around Troy, the negative tactics seem to be working.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lehman, for instance, said she could no longer support Mr. Lazio because she disagreed with his votes on Medicare and education issues in Congress. ''I think his campaign was misleading,'' she said. ''He said he was for these things, but they dug up that he really wasn't.''</p>
        <p>In recent ads, Mrs. Clinton's campaign has accused Mr. Lazio of voting against Medicare spending, when in fact he had voted to cut increases in the spending. Her campaign has also criticized Mr. Lazio for voting against a Democratic bill to provide financing for 100,000 more teachers, though he voted for a Republican bill that did much the same thing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's unflattering portrayal of Mrs. Clinton -- as a carpetbagger without a political record -- has also resonated with voters. ''You just hear that people don't like Hillary, you don't hear about the issues,'' said James Moore, 22, a building materials salesman who was walking through the nearly deserted downtown last weekend. ''Unless you're really into politics, they're not doing a good job of explaining the issues and what they stand for.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore, a recent graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, said he considered himself a voter without a party, or a candidate. To earn his loyalty, he said, a candidate must address education issues, like college loans, and revitalizing the upstate economy. ''I don't see myself voting for either of them,'' he said. ''But I could be swayed if I heard something that would impact my life.''</p>
        <p>Both candidates have recently proposed tax cuts -- Mr. Lazio's to spur the economy and Mrs. Clinton's to be aimed at specific income groups. And Mrs. Clinton has even put together a specific upstate revival plan. But most voters interviewed around Troy seemed unaware of those proposals. Instead, they spoke of the candidates in general terms and struggled to discuss any specific campaign issue or platform.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton remains better known to Democrats and Republicans alike  after her nearly eight years in the public spotlight as the first lady and because of her head start in the Senate race. She has been campaigning for more than a year around the state, including several times in Troy. Mr. Lazio jumped in this spring after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani withdrew from the race to undergo treatment for prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>But voters continue to raise things that Mrs. Clinton has tried to leave behind: her husband's dalliance with an intern, his impeachment, Whitewater. They said those embarrassments had left a negative impression. ''I've heard a lot about Hillary,'' said Audrey Slocum, 71, a retired cook waiting at a corner bus stop. ''It's not all negative, and she's probably a very smart woman, but I just don't like her. I don't trust her. She wants power; I think that's obvious.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Slocum, a longtime Republican, had heard much less about her own party's candidate, even though her state senator, Joseph L. Bruno, who represents Rensselaer County, was one of the first political leaders to back Mr. Lazio publicly. ''He seems to be a very nice man,'' Ms. Slocum said of Mr. Lazio. ''He follows the Republican line, and I tend to be conservative.''</p>
        <p>At the counter in Barb's Coffee-Tyme in downtown Troy, the regulars talked more favorably about Mrs. Clinton between bites of scrambled eggs and sips of steaming coffee. Judy Grugan, 51, a housekeeper sitting on a black vinyl stool, praised the first lady for focusing attention on special education. Her 15-year-old son has a reading disability. ''That's one of her main goals, her and the kids, and the schools have improved even around here,'' said Ms. Grugan, a Democrat who decided to vote for Mrs. Clinton long before Mr. Lazio entered the race.</p>
        <p>But other coffee shop regulars said they knew too much about Mrs. Clinton for comfort. When asked which candidate they would most likely vote for, most said they did not know or named someone altogether different: Mayor Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki, even the retiring incumbent, Daniel Patrick Moynihan.</p>
        <p>''I don't like Lazio because of his political philosophy,'' said William  Sullivan, 75, a retired truck driver and lifelong Democrat as he stared morosely at his empty plate. ''She's all right but I don't think she's the best candidate either. It's unfortunate that our present senator is going to retire. They just don't have the political skills that he has.''</p>
