        <p>Gov. George W. Bush abandoned his effort to impose his own schedule of presidential debates today, and his campaign said it was prepared to sit down with aides to Vice President Al Gore to work out an agreement for debating under the auspices of a bipartisan commission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers responded that they were willing to meet with the Bush campaign. The Commission on Presidential Debates, the bipartisan panel that has been organizing the debates since 1988, said it had received a call today from Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, Don Evans, and immediately began trying to arrange a meeting with representatives of both campaigns next week in Washington.</p>
        <p>But the governor's decision did not appear to guarantee that Mr. Bush would sign off on the commission's original plan for three debates next month on college campuses in Boston, Winston-Salem, N.C., and St. Louis, all of which Mr. Gore has agreed to. Advisers to Mr. Bush continued to insist that while the campaign might agree to two of the commission's debates, it remained opposed to the Boston event and wanted to replace it with a network-sponsored debate, perhaps with CNN's Larry King as moderator.</p>
        <p>''Everybody knows there have got to be two commission debates, and everybody knows there has to be an agreement soon,'' an adviser to Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Bush repeated their position that Boston was not acceptable, because the debate was scheduled to be held on the University of Massachusetts campus adjacent to the John F. Kennedy Library, which honors a Democratic president. ''I can't think of any reason in the world why we'd do that,'' the adviser said.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign announced the shift in the face of what aides to the governor described as mounting criticism from prominent Republicans, and a desire to put a distracting issue to rest. Mr. Bush made the proposal on Sunday night, challenging Mr. Gore to two network debates, one on CNN and one on NBC, in addition to one sponsored by the commission.</p>
        <p>Because the network debates were likely to attract far fewer viewers than the commission debates, which were to be broadcast on multiple networks and cable outlets, many Democrats accused Mr. Bush of trying to avoid wide exposure.</p>
        <p>And while Mr. Bush tried to use Mr. Gore's rejection of the idea to raise questions about the vice president's credibility, even some members of Mr. Bush's staff suggested that the strategy was not working.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Bush advisers sought today to shift blame for the collapse of their proposal to Mr. Gore, saying he had made it clear he would not attend a debate proposed by Mr. Bush for next week on a prime-time edition of ''Meet the Press'' on NBC.</p>
        <p>''NBC News has told us that they have received a letter from Vice President Gore indicating that he will not attend the debate next Tuesday night,'' Mr. Bush's communications director, Karen P. Hughes, told reporters in a brief stop here.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes added that Mr. Gore's refusal came ''despite the fact that he had accepted that debate and said he will debate anytime, anywhere.''</p>
        <p>''NBC News reiterated today that they will not host the debate unless both candidates are there,'' she said.</p>
        <p>NBC News and the Gore campaign disputed the suggestion by Ms. Hughes that the letter was news. Mr. Gore's aides announced days ago that the vice president would not participate. And Barbara Levin, an NBC spokeswoman, said the network has had that rejection letter from William M. Daley, the Gore campaign chairman, since Sunday, the day Mr. Bush unveiled his plan.</p>
        <p>Mark Fabiani, the Gore campaign communications director, said: ''We sent that letter within an hour of Governor Bush's press conference. We faxed it to Tim Russert at his home and at his office.'' Mr. Russert is the host of ''Meet the Press.''</p>
        <p>After learning today that Mr. Bush had abandoned his plan, Mr. Daley said he welcomed the opportunity to meet with the governor's staff, but he seemed inclined to stick with the commission's original plan of three debates.</p>
        <p>''We'll go in and hear what they have to say,'' he said. ''Right now, our attitude is three. It's only four and a half hours in a campaign that lasts thousands of hours.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush had contended that his proposal, which included the 90-minute debate in St. Louis sponsored by the commission, plus two 60-minute debates, on ''Meet the Press'' on Tuesday and ''Larry King Live'' on Oct. 3, was an effort to invigorate the debates. Mr. Gore, however, sought to characterize the proposal  as an effort to limit viewership. Two major networks left out of the Bush plan, ABC and CBS, announced that they would not carry debates on rivals' programs.</p>
        <p>Debate commission officials have repeatedly said they are willing to negotiate over the formats of the debates, and would even entertain suggestions for moderators. But they have been less willing to forgo the debate sites, which were chosen from proposals submitted by dozens of institutions around the country.</p>
        <p>There is precedent for holding two commission debates. Four years ago, one commission debate was canceled because President Clinton had a scheduling conflict. Still, even those close to Mr. Bush were hard-pressed to view the counterdebates as even a partial victory.</p>
        <p>Days after the plan was announced, the campaign began running a commercial criticizing Mr. Gore for not accepting the plan, which failed to move the vice president from his dismissal of the Bush proposal. And privately, some Democrats said today that they believed that the Republicans' ability to bargain over the debates was diminished by Mr. Bush's abortive plan.</p>
