        <p>In a remarkable span of four holes, Tiger Woods went from the doldrums into contention today.</p>
        <p>While Grant Waite made eagle on his final hole to take a one-stroke lead at the Bell Canadian Open, Woods made a huge move up the leader board, from a tie for 45th place into a tie for seventh. Even for Woods, what he did from the 15th through the 18th holes was extraordinary: birdie, eagle, birdie, eagle.</p>
        <p>Woods birdied the par-3 No. 15 with a pinpoint 8-iron tee shot to within six feet of the cup. He made eagle at No. 16, smashing his drive 348 yards. He made another birdie at No. 17, hitting a gorgeous 6-iron fairway bunker shot from 172 yards to within eight feet of the hole. And at No. 18, he made eagle again, hitting his drive an astonishing 380 yards. The wind was at Woods's back, but 380 yards off the tee? He had to laugh when he talked about that one.</p>
        <p>How often does anyone shoot six under par over a four-hole span? But how often does a player like Woods come along? Storming past a host of competitors and setting up an intriguing weekend at Glen Abbey Golf Club, Woods shot a seven-under-par 65 and closed to four strokes behind the leader of the tournament after finishing at even par in the first round.</p>
        <p>Waite, a 36-year-old from New Zealand who last won on the PGA Tour in 1993, was the surprise second-round leader by two strokes. He was 11 under par (133) after a second-round 64 today. Greg Chalmers of Australia was in second place at 10 under par (69-65), while Brian Watts (67-68) was in third place.</p>
        <p>Woods was not the only prominent player in contention. Sergio Garcia, who defeated Woods in a made-for-television exhibition last month, shot 69 and was tied for fourth place at eight under par with Keiichiro Fukabori, Shaun Micheel and Brian Watts. Davis Love III, the winner of the 1997 P.G.A. Championship, was tied for seventh place at seven under par with Woods, Craig Barlow, J. L. Lewis and Kevin Sutherland, who began today with a one-stroke lead.</p>
        <p>So the stage was set. There was the potential for a showdown between Woods and Garcia. There was a chance for Love to beat them both. There was a chance for lesser-known players like Chalmers, Micheel and Sutherland to win for the first time on tour. And there was Woods's quest to become only the second player to win the United States Open, the British Open and the Canadian Open in the same year, matching Lee Trevino, who won all three in 1971.</p>
        <p>Waite, who finished second at the Air Canada Championship last weekend, was eager to see how he would respond to the pressure. His only tour victory came at the 1993 Kemper Open.</p>
        <p>''I had no idea what I was doing,'' Waite said, smiling at the memory. ''I beat Tom Kite. Ignorance is bliss. But I can carry that with me. I've won a tournament out here and a lot of guys haven't. This weekend I have to try and block out the distractions and keep my mind on what I'm doing.''</p>
        <p>But Woods liked his chances far better than he did Thursday. Today he made quite a comeback, even though he almost missed his tee time, thinking it was an hour later than it actually was. Still feeling the effects of flu symptoms, Woods was calmly eating breakfast in the clubhouse when someone told him he had only 15 minutes until his 7:58 a.m. tee time. Just like that, breakfast was over. Woods rushed to the driving range, hit a few balls, then headed to the 10th tee, where he hurriedly began his round.</p>
        <p>''Actually, it was probably a blessing in disguise,'' Woods said. ''I'm not really feeling my best physically. It was nice not to wear myself out on the range. That short warm-up is something I do anyway when I'm not feeling well, or in real hot conditions.''</p>
        <p>Woods got hot starting with his tee shot on No. 15, an 8-iron from 150 yards that looked good the instant it left the club face. He could not recall ever having a birdie-eagle-birdie-eagle stretch. Once in 1997, playing a friendly practice round with Mark O'Meara at their Isleworth home course in Windermere, Fla., Woods shot a 59, playing the first nine holes at 10 under par.</p>
        <p>But this was an official tournament, and the way Woods played No. 18, a 508-yard par 5, looked almost unfair. After his 380-yard drive, Woods needed only a 60-degree wedge to reach the green.</p>
        <p>Garcia is also a big hitter, but at No. 18, which he birdied, Garcia needed a driver, then an 8-iron to reach the green.</p>
        <p>This weekend, instead of running away with the tournament, Woods will have to catch up.</p>
        <p>''Once you see Tiger on the leader board, you know that you can't make any mistakes,'' Garcia said. ''But if you are intimidated by any player, you are not going to be able to play your game. Some players get intimidated, and some players don't. I hope I'll never get intimidated.''</p>
