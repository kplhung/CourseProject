        <p>The front page image on The New York Daily News yesterday captured the moment almost every newspaper across the country wanted to get: Fidel Castro nearly shaking hands with President Clinton.</p>
        <p>But the photograph was not exactly real. A note at the bottom right corner of the page read ''Daily News Photo Illustration.'' The image, a composite of two pictures, has officials at the White House and some in journalism circles questioning the newspaper's ethics.</p>
        <p>Ed Kosner, the editor in chief of The Daily News, said that there was ''no effort at misrepresentation'' and that the label for ''the photo illustration was in type larger than we usually use for captions.''</p>
        <p>The handshake, the first between  an American president and the Cuban leader, became news Thursday after President Clinton and Mr. Castro met at the United Nations Millennium Summit meeting in New York.</p>
        <p>The meeting was not photographed by any news agencies and  news organizations were unable to obtain a picture from the White House or the Cuban delegation.</p>
        <p>Several news organizations have faced criticism in recent years for prominently using photographs that have been manipulated. Time magazine was ridiculed for darkening a police mug shot of O.J. Simpson, and Newsday was criticized for combining two pictures to make it appear as if Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan were skating on the ice together at the 1994 Olympics.</p>
        <p>White House officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity and who worry that the image could cause problems for Vice President Al Gore, complained that the words ''photo illustration'' could not be read on The Daily News Web page.</p>
