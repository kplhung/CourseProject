        <p>JUST when Martina Hingis believed she had neutralized her opponent's vaunted power, she was suddenly confronted with the specter of Venus Williams's heart.</p>
        <p>It's a very big one, everyone should realize after Hingis let Williams off the hook and Older Sister surfaced from the depths of a third-set deficit to claim a United States Open semifinal that was deliciously desperate, if not uniformly pretty.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Hingis took Williams apart in an Open final between one polished teenager and another who was raw as a cold rain. ''A yearling,'' Williams said, laughing as she remembered her 1997 rookie Open run after her 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory sent her to this afternoon's final against Lindsay Davenport. ''I didn't know what I was doing, basically.''</p>
        <p>What she knew yesterday, after 24 straight victories that included her Wimbledon title, was what it took to win just about the time she looked worn out. She knew not to be afraid to go for it, to ''take the opportunities, because when you don't, they're gone.''</p>
        <p>In her game of punch and counter with the crafty Hingis, Williams is the superior athlete and nothing about that will ever change. But she deserves credit for so much more now because length and muscles alone do not make the legs chase the ball as if it were life itself.</p>
        <p>At the point Hingis had her 5-3 lead in the third set, moments before Williams's own father couldn't take the specter of defeat and walked on out, it appeared Hingis's game plan of softening Williams up with shots down the middle, into the body, was going to work. Now Hingis, feeling the weight of nearly three sets at the shot-making pace only a Williams can force, played the more percentage angles, sent her ground strokes into the corners and bet the tournament that Williams was in no shape to extend her angular frame to dig them out.</p>
        <p>''That was maybe my hope towards the end of the match,'' Hingis admitted. ''That she would still miss some return or she'd give me a chance to survive and finish it off.''</p>
        <p>At 3-5, 15-30, Hingis had a much-discussed overhead to put away that could have set up double-match point. Hingis is sure to remember the puny shot she returned to Williams's backhand for a down-the-line winner. Not to be forgotten is how Williams frantically stayed in that point, sprinting side to side, somehow keeping the ball and her hopes in play.</p>
        <p>Williams and Hingis do not represent the classic matchup of the baseliner versus the serve-and-volleyer. They are not Navratilova and Evert, or McEnroe and Borg. But rarely in any tennis match are we treated to the furious rallies the second and third sets were full of. The kind of points that reminded us these two players don't have to embrace each other, or like each other, but they sure should know that they bring out the best in each other.</p>
        <p>''Oh, it's a great time,'' Williams conceded.</p>
        <p>''Well, I do enjoy it,'' Hingis said. ''If you win, you enjoy more than if you lose.''</p>
        <p>She had left the Arthur Ashe Stadium and appeared in the corridor outside the women's locker room on the verge of tears. Then came Williams, a little glassy eyed herself, with a distinct wobble to her step. Her father, Richard, was already gone from the National Tennis Center, out into New York's evening rush. Who knows -- who cares? -- why he bolted after his daughter netted a drop shot for 15-30 in the ninth game of the third set? A pack of reporters followed him out, just as the real story was about to unfold.</p>
        <p>''Oh yeah,'' Venus Williams said, about to author the headline. ''I've got a pretty big heart these days.''</p>
        <p>No brag. Just fact. After saving her serve for 4-5, Williams broke Hingis at 15 to pull even. On the 15-30 point, Hingis got a short ball and angled a backhand crosscourt that looked like a winner. Williams was on it, though, with an elastic stretch and a primal scream. Suddenly, the two-hand backhand was down the line, deep in the corner. Hingis spanked it into the net. Her shoulders sagged and her expression finally seemed to say, ''I can't.''</p>
        <p>She is a wonderful player, Hingis is, who stands in tall against all these women who have half a foot on her. She had a plan yesterday, a thirst to win her first Grand Slam title since January of 1999. Yet just when Hingis began to believe she could be the toast of the Open again, Venus Williams refused to follow her father out into the street. He walked. She ran.</p>
