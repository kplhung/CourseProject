        <p>Correction of Sept 8 article, which misstated prosecutors' arguments for allowing testimony by two psychiatrists at Dr Robert Bierenbaum's trial</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about preparations in Manhattan for the trial of Dr. Robert Bierenbaum, who is accused of having killed his wife, Gail Katz-Bierenbaum, misstated prosecutors' arguments for allowing testimony by two psychiatrists who treated him before she disappeared in 1985. The prosecutors argued that because Dr. Bierenbaum permitted the psychiatrists to warn his wife and his parents that Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum might be in danger, he had waived his right to confidentiality. The prosecutors did not argue that the psychiatrists had waived it.</p>
