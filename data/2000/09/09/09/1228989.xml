        <p>They were parents and grandparents who thought they had fully grasped the perils facing their teenagers in the tough working-class streets north of Kennedy Airport in Queens. They said that they understood the power of peers, the lure of gangs and drugs, the impact of movies and music and television that with relentless repetition depicted a culture of casual violence.</p>
        <p>And, they said, they believed  they had taken the necessary precautions.</p>
        <p>They gave their children beepers and cellular phones to keep better track of them. They lined up mentors, and set curfews, and encouraged faith. When there were small signs of trouble -- skipped classes, foul language, low grades -- they cracked down with more rules. They had heart-to-heart talks about being leaders, not followers, about making distinctions between friends and manipulators, and of course they prayed, as parents everywhere do, that all their efforts, however imperfect, had somehow inoculated their babies from trouble.</p>
        <p>But on Tuesday, when the detectives began knocking at their doors with questions about murder and robbery, many of these adults said that they began for the first time to recognize with terrifying clarity the limits of their control over their children. Five teenagers ages 14 to 17 -- each from relatively stable middle-class homes, and none with a criminal record -- are accused of luring Jin-Sheng Liu, the owner of the Golden Wok restaurant, to a secluded, vacant house in Springfield Gardens, Queens, and then, during a bungled ambush to steal their $60 order of Chinese food, beating him to death with a brick.</p>
        <p>According to prosecutors, the teenagers have confessed to varying degrees of involvement, and so now -- between waves of tears and anger and disbelief, between frantic calls to lawyers and fending off reporters -- five stunned families find themselves confronting a nightmarish tangle of questions. Where did they fail? What did they miss? What more could they have done?</p>
        <p>''It just rips you apart,'' said Jean Smith, the mother of James Stone, the 16-year-old who police officials said threw a sheet over Mr. Liu's head moments before his skull was shattered by repeated blows. ''It makes you think maybe you failed. But I tell you, I tried so hard. I tried my hardest. My whole family did.''</p>
        <p>The contours of this parental anguish became clear this week during extended interviews with relatives of three of the teenagers and with neighbors, close friends or lawyers for the other two. Deepening their anguish is an unfathomable reality: an immigrant who struggled resolutely to build a restaurant business is dead, leaving behind a wife and two children.</p>
        <p>''I feel so terrible for what happened,'' said the mother of Robert Savage, 14, who the police say  was the one who hit Mr. Liu with the brick. ''Can you imagine what they are going through? They lost their father for what? Stupid food. I cannot believe I raised that child. He knows better than that.'' She added: ''I can't eat, I can't sleep. I really had no idea my life could get into something like this.''</p>
        <p>On the night of Sept. 1, only hours before Mr. Liu's death, all five teenagers seemed fully occupied with the usual rhythms of teenage life.</p>
        <p>Early in the evening, Jamel Murphy, 17, was flirting with girls at one of his favorite hangouts -- the Foster-Laurie Police Athletic League building in St. Albans, Queens. A tall, stocky boy who was obsessed with the notion of playing professional basketball, Mr. Murphy had spent most every day of the summer at the building, coaching a basketball team of 9- and 10-year-old boys. His supervisors gave him high marks.</p>
        <p>But that night, children were performing dance routines to the music of Whitney Houston, and Mr. Murphy watched some of the performances with his close friend, Ebony Cheston, 16. He and Ms. Cheston had talked often recently of their futures, of getting out of Queens. Ms. Cheston said they had both become wary of street violence. Mr. Murphy had vowed to avoid confrontation. ''I'll walk away,'' he told her.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy left about 7:30 p.m., saying he was going to see his friend  Darryl Tyson, 17, another student at Hillcrest High School in Queens. Mr. Tyson lived in Springfield Gardens, in a neighborhood of twisting dead-end streets and single-family homes just off Merrick Boulevard.</p>
        <p>By that time, Stacy Royster, 17, had caught a bus to Mr. Tyson's home from her grandmother's house in Rosedale on the eastern edge of  Queens. She knew Mr. Tyson from high school, and they remained close friends even after Ms. Royster left school and finished her studies at home. Ms. Royster was about to begin her first semester at Queensborough Community College. She had just bought her first batch of textbooks, said her grandmother, Anastasia Brown, who has raised Ms. Royster since the death of her mother nine years ago.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown worried about her granddaughter; she was fragile, prone to acting out, vulnerable, she said. For several years the girl had  struggled with bipolar disorder, but  doctors assured Ms. Brown that Ms. Royster would be fine if she took her medication. Around 8 p.m., Ms. Brown decided to beep her. Ms. Royster promptly called her back from the cell phone her grandmother had given her for just that purpose. ''Stacy, don't get home too late,'' Ms. Brown said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a few blocks from Mr. Tyson's home, James Stone was getting ready to say goodbye to his mother, who was leaving that night for a church bus trip to Canada. Mr. Stone moved to Queens only last spring. He had lived with his father in Atlanta, but they had been quarreling. His parents decided he should live with his mother, who had recently remarried.</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith, 49, a senior teletype operator for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said that while her son fit in well at home, he sometimes struggled at August Martin High School in Queens. He was often bored by school, she said, and he sometimes cut classes. Nor was she pleased with some of his new friends. Alarmed, she convened family meetings. She  suggested Bible readings to her son. More recently, she said, she had decided and he had readily agreed that he should attend a Catskill boarding school that emphasized military discipline.</p>
        <p>''I always worried about Jay,'' she said, ''because he's a boy, and boys don't like to stay home, and there are so many temptations out there.''</p>
        <p>But that Friday night, she felt certain that her son was in good hands with her husband, Ralph Smith, a maintenance man. Her son, she said, had grown close to his stepfather -- he called him Pop -- and she had also taken comfort in a recent conversation. They had been watching a movie that showed a grisly murder.</p>
        <p>''Oh, man, that's so cold-hearted,'' her son had said, prompting a discussion about the consequences of violence.</p>
        <p>On that Friday night, her main worry was that the two men wouldn't eat right while she was away. She stocked the kitchen with steaks and hamburgers, gave her son $20, and laid out smothered pork chops, green beans and corn for dinner that night.</p>
        <p>''Be good,'' she told her son, giving him a hug and a kiss before driving off about 10 p.m.</p>
        <p>Five doors up the road, the parents of Robert Savage were getting nervous. He had said he would be home by 10, but he wasn't. So his father went out looking for him. It was a typical response, neighbors said, describing the 14-year-old's parents as doting but strict. Recently, they had been warning him to stay away from older boys, some of whom liked to gather at a nearby dead end and drink Olde English Malt and smoke marijuana.</p>
        <p>''We have been fighting about that for months,'' his mother said. ''I talk to him loud, I talk to him soft, I beg.''</p>
        <p>It remains unclear, investigators said, who among the teenagers raised the idea of robbing a deliveryman, or how they arrived at their plan to ambush Mr. Liu, a slightly built man, 5 feet 6 inches tall.</p>
        <p>For the last 10 years, Mr. Liu had run the Golden Wok, a take-out restaurant at 192nd Street and Linden Boulevard, in St. Albans, not far from where the teenagers were hanging out that night. He made the deliveries himself.</p>
        <p>According to the police, the teenagers had a scheme: Ms. Royster was to order the food from her cellular phone and greet the deliveryman. When he got there, she would stand up to reach into her pockets, as if she were going to pay. The four boys, three of them holding bricks and one of them holding an old bedsheet to cover Mr. Liu's head, were to wait in hiding, then jump him.</p>
        <p>Knowing that deliverymen can be suspicious, particularly when young people order food, they decided that Ms. Royster should place the order because, as a girl, she would be perceived as less of a threat. Ms. Royster placed the first call at 10:52 p.m., ordering General Tso's chicken, shrimp egg foo yong, chicken with broccoli and shrimp lo mein -- $60 worth of food in all, according to the police and prosecutors. Mr. Murphy told the police that he wore a latex glove because he was going to search the man's car for money, according to court records.</p>
        <p>Having been robbed twice before while making deliveries, Mr. Liu, 44, called back to confirm the order and the address, investigators said. Ms. Royster called the restaurant three more times before Mr. Liu arrived, at least once to change the address, investigators said.</p>
        <p>Many restaurant workers along Linden Boulevard, a lively commercial strip dotted with takeout places and Caribbean-style restaurants, say they have had to take extra precautions when making deliveries. Several have installed caller-ID to verify phone numbers; sometimes they call back and cancel orders if no one answers. Others avoid venturing into rougher neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Despite the change of address, Mr. Liu went ahead with the delivery. And shortly before 11:30 p.m., he pulled up to the house and got out of his car carrying two bags of food. He walked across a grassy patch of lawn toward the stoop, and Ms. Royster greeted him and pretended she was going to pay.</p>
        <p>The four boys jumped out of the bushes and descended on Mr. Liu in a flash of chaos and violence, punching and trying to choke him and then eventually killing him by smashing him in the head with a brick, according to the police and court records. Mr. Stone, who had gone to his house around the corner to get the sheet, threw it over Mr. Liu's head, police said.</p>
        <p>The teenagers gave varying accounts to the police of what happened.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stone told investigators that when Mr. Liu got to the house, Mr. Tyson started choking him and wrestled him to the ground as he struggled to break free, before Mr. Savage smashed him with the brick, according to court records. Ms. Royster told investigators that after Mr. Stone threw the sheet over Mr. Liu's head, all four of the boys were fighting with him. Mr. Savage told the police Mr. Tyson first grabbed Mr. Liu from behind while Mr. Stone put the sheet over his head, and then Mr. Savage hit him with the brick.</p>
        <p>Lt. Richard Bellucci, commanding officer of the 113th detective squad in Jamaica, who oversaw the police investigation, said that it was hard to sort out exactly how the attack unfolded, but that he believed Mr. Tyson and Mr. Murphy had grabbed Mr. Liu and started choking and punching him. The lieutenant said  Mr. Savage was the only one to use a brick in the attack, even though two other boys had brought bricks to the house.</p>
        <p>''It happened all at once,'' he said, adding, ''This went down very quickly.''</p>
        <p>The teenagers then fled, taking one bag of the Chinese food with them. They went to Mr. Tyson's house, a few blocks away on 178th Street, where, they told police, they hid for several hours, Lieutenant Bellucci said. They ate the food there.</p>
        <p>For a few days, their worlds remained intact. Ms. Royster prepared for her first day of college. Mr. Stone's mother returned from her church trip and completed his application for boarding school.</p>
        <p>''I heard some Chinese man died,'' Mr. Tyson told a friend he met at Green Acres Mall.</p>
        <p>None of their parents suspected a thing.</p>
        <p>But by Tuesday, having traced the cell phone calls to Ms. Royster and confronted her, detectives from the 113th Precinct fanned out to make arrests.</p>
        <p>When they knocked on Mr. Stone's door at 11:30 p.m., his mother cried out in panic. She assumed they were there to tell her that her son was dead.</p>
        <p>She said her son at first calmly denied everything.</p>
        <p>Today, what makes her most angry is the suggestion that a man died because her son and his friends wanted a free meal. ''He had a hot dinner on a stove and a house full of food,'' she said, adding that she had since given her son her Bible to read in jail.</p>
        <p>After the arrests, Ms. Royster's grandmother's hands trembled so badly, she could not dial the telephone. ''I dedicated myself to Stacey,'' she said. ''That's why it hurts so much. Sometimes I wonder if I've done too much.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy's father was so angry that a day after the arrest he was shaking with rage. Meanwhile, the players at the athletic league were stunned to see their coach on television, head down and in handcuffs. One of his players, Ebony Cheston's brother, burst into tears.</p>
        <p>''Jamel was his mentor,'' Ms. Cheston said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Savage's mother, who came to this country from the West Indies, said she could barely bring herself to talk to distant friends and relatives.</p>
        <p>''I'm so ashamed of what has happened,'' she said, weeping. ''I'm afraid even to let people know. I'm ashamed of it even though I didn't do anything.''</p>
