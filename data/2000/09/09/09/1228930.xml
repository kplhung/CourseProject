        <p>Law Hing shifted restlessly from one foot to the other as he listened to the candidates trade accusations in a debate at a housing project here this week. ''These guys are without integrity,'' he said, shaking his head at the litany of supposed wrongdoing and chicanery.</p>
        <p>Well over a million people are expected to turn out for legislative elections on Sunday, the second such vote since Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Many, like Mr. Law, 73, regard voting as a civic duty and a hard-won privilege. But even though this is the largest exercise in multiparty politics under Chinese rule, Beijing has barely a walk-on role.</p>
        <p>Rather than seizing the election as an opportunity to stand up to China, most people here regard it as a chance to register their dissatisfaction with the local establishment. Hong Kong politics, which in previous years throbbed with debates about freedom and law, now revolve around seamier issues, like a party boss who failed to disclose his business interests.</p>
        <p>''The Beijing factor is no longer important,'' said Lau Siu-kai, a professor at the Chinese University here. ''China is perceived as having withdrawn from local politics. But there is still a lot of voter discontent.''</p>
        <p>People here blame the government for failing to lift Hong Kong out of the Asian economic crisis more quickly. They say it has moved from scandal to scandal under the hapless leadership of Tung Chee-hwa, a shipping magnate installed by Beijing as Hong Kong's chief executive. The Legislature is seen as an ineffectual body that carps about Mr. Tung but offers no solutions of its own.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Tung's ties to Beijing, dissatisfaction with him has not translated into unhappiness with China. In a new survey by Hong Kong Baptist University, 63 percent of those polled approved of the performance of the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, while only 32 percent approved of Mr. Tung.</p>
        <p>''There is a decline in optimism,'' said Michael DeGolyer,  who conducted the survey. ''But it seems to have more to do with how Hong Kong's leaders are performing than with any supposed interference from Beijing.''</p>
        <p>The ebbing of China as a hot issue has scrambled Hong Kong's political landscape. In 1998, when fears about Beijing were still running high, the Democratic Party scored a resounding victory, winning nearly half the directly elected seats in the Legislature.</p>
        <p>But in district elections last year, the Democrats lost ground to the main pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong. Its emphasis on the economy was more appealing to voters in recession-ravaged Hong Kong than appeals to democracy or civil liberties.</p>
        <p>This time around, analysts predict that the Democratic Party will hold on to its position -- but only because the pro-Beijing party has been tarred by a scandal involving one of its founders.</p>
        <p>The party may also be hurt because of its coziness with Mr. Tung's government. This week Mr. Tung was on the defensive again after an investigation concluded that one of his advisers had met with officials at Hong Kong University to suppress opinion surveys critical of the government.</p>
        <p>Some analysts say this aggressively local election is a sign of Hong Kong's political maturity. Left alone by Beijing, the former British colony is behaving like any big city during campaign season -- consumed by local disputes.</p>
        <p>But other commentators say the nasty tone reflects Hong Kong's stunted political culture, where only 24 of the 60 members of the Legislature are directly elected.</p>
