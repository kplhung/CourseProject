        <p>The biggest player in the National Hockey League has a big problem.</p>
        <p>Zdeno Chara will not play for the Islanders this season -- or for any other team in the N.H.L.</p>
        <p>The 6-foot-9-inch defenseman rejected the team's latest offer, and General Manager Mike Milbury said yesterday that the Islanders had terminated talks and would not negotiate with him again until next summer. That will effectively sideline Chara for the season, but Milbury insisted he would not trade the 23-year-old.</p>
        <p>''He's made a mistake as big as he is,'' Milbury said as the team began training camp in Lake Placid, N.Y. ''He was well aware of a time frame. There is no chance he will play for us this year. None. Zero. Zilch. If he came in tomorrow and asked to play for $1, the answer would be no.''</p>
        <p>Chara, at home on Long Island, said he was stunned when he got the early-morning phone call from Milbury wishing him good luck, and goodbye.</p>
        <p>''I was shocked; I still am,' Chara said. ''It's really disappointing. I wanted to be with my teammates and help the team, but it's out of my hands.</p>
        <p>The owners and Mike have decided they were not going to pay. They have their rights, but in this case I think they were using them to make a point.''</p>
        <p>Chara, a restricted free agent who last season earned a base salary of $575,000 and a signing bonus of $275,000, was seeking a four-year, $4 million deal but would have settled for a two-year contract worth $2 million. The Islanders, who under the collective bargaining agreement did not have to offer more than a 10 percent raise over Chara's base salary last year, countered with several different packages, including a three-year deal totaling $2.4 million beginning at $700,000 a year, and a four-year deal worth $3.7 million beginning at $750,000.</p>
