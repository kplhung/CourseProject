        <p>The embattled Indiana University Coach Bobby Knight last night denied an allegation that he physically and verbally assaulted a student on Thursday afternoon after the student addressed him by his last name.</p>
        <p>In a news conference on the school's campus in Bloomington last night, Knight said he had a brief encounter with the student about ''manners and civility'' but said he never swore at the student or manhandled him.</p>
        <p>At the news conference, Knight also had one of his assistant coaches, Mike Davis -- who said he had witnessed the incident -- vouch that the allegation was untrue.</p>
        <p>The news conference came just hours after the university confirmed that it was investigating what Christopher Simpson, a school spokesman, described as an ''extraordinarily serious'' allegation. And it came just four months after Myles Brand, the president of the university, suspended Knight for three games in the coming season, fined him $30,000 and warned him that any future instances of unacceptable behavior could result in his immediate dismissal.</p>
        <p>Brand instituted his zero-tolerance policy after a seven-week investigation by the school's board of trustees concluded that Knight had displayed a ''pattern of inappropriate behavior'' that had embarrassed the university. Among the accusations investigated by the trustees were that the often-volatile Knight had once choked a player during practice and had hurled a vase near a school secretary during a fit of anger.</p>
        <p>In the latest incident, Mark Shaw, a former Bloomington-area radio talk-show host and a critic of Knight, told ESPN that his stepson -- a 19-year-old freshman -- had been grabbed by Knight and cursed at after he greeted him on campus at about 2 p.m. Thursday by saying, ''Hey, what's up, Knight?''</p>
        <p>Shaw told The Indianapolis Star that he saw finger marks on his stepson's arm and reported the incident later that afternoon. He, his stepson and four other witnesses also reported the incident to the campus police. Shaw asked that Knight apologize and that the incident be reported to a committee headed by Clarence Doninger, the athletics director, and charged with devising a code of conduct for Knight and all university coaches.</p>
        <p>At the news conference last night, Knight acknowledged he was going through a doorway at Assembly Hall -- where the basketball team plays its games -- when Shaw's stepson, Kent Harvey, greeted Knight by his last name.</p>
        <p>''My name is not Knight to you,'' the coach said he told the student. ''It is Coach or Mr. Knight.''</p>
        <p>Knight said he had his hand on the inside of the young man's arm as he addressed him but said the allegations of any pulling or spinning of the student were false.</p>
        <p>At the news conference, Knight used a blackboard to diagram the doorway encounter, then used Davis as a prop to demonstrate Knight's version of what occurred.</p>
        <p>''He never said a cuss word; he never raised his voice,'' Davis said of Knight.</p>
        <p>Knight told reporters that the student is the stepson of what he termed his ''most vitriolic critic.'' He also said that in the wake of his recent sanctions, he would have to be an ''absolute moron'' to get involved in a public confrontation.</p>
        <p>''You can't enter anger into this thing,'' said Knight, who at one point recounted how through his own mistake as a youngster he had learned the proper way to address adults. ''This is a matter of manners and civility.''</p>
        <p>Lt. Jerry Minger of the campus police said investigators were scheduling interviews with the younger Shaw as well as other witnesses, but that it was difficult to determine how long it would take to complete the investigation.</p>
        <p>Shaw said his stepson and the witnesses were interviewed by the Indiana University police and investigators took pictures of his son's arms.</p>
        <p>''If he wants to tell this fantasy story, then how did the marks get on his skin?'' Shaw said tonight in a telephone conversation.</p>
        <p>When asked about the suggestion that Knight was set up, Shaw said: ''Does he really think that out of 37,000 kids, mine is going to wander in front of him? I think that's reaching for an explanation.''</p>
