        <p>With the loss of the nuclear submarine Kursk and its 118-member crew, President Vladimir V. Putin has begun consultations with other leaders on an international agreement in which nations that operate warships under the sea would come to one another's aid during disasters.</p>
        <p>The proposals, drafted by a commission investigating the causes of the Kursk's sinking in the Barents Sea on Aug. 12, were discussed by Mr. Putin during this week's meeting of world leaders at the United Nations. Mr. Putin confirmed in a meeting with news media executives on Wednesday that he had carried the proposals to New York for discussion with other leaders, but the Russian plan has not been elaborated on in public.</p>
        <p>In an interview in Moscow today, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya I. Klebanov, who heads the investigating commission, said that a decade after the end of the cold war, a ''framework of relations'' is needed along with a ''general system of a provision of assistance'' between submarine navies.</p>
        <p>The Russian initiative follows a political outcry over Mr. Putin's delay in requesting foreign assistance to help rescue the crew of the Kursk.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Putin made clear in comments this week in New York that he believed that most crew members died immediately in a powerful explosion that destroyed the forward compartments of the vessel as the ship prepared to fire a torpedo during an exercise.</p>
        <p>He also said that tapping noises emanating from the sunken vessel just after the accident were not, as initially thought, made by crew members, but came from unknown ''mechanical'' sources. Initially, the noises had energized the rescue effort and riveted international attention on the plight of the crew.</p>
        <p>By recommending that well-defined protocols be established for rescues during catastrophes, Mr. Putin may be seeking to blunt political recriminations from his domestic critics. But his proposals may also prompt an examination of how submarine commanders, engaged in silent reconnaissance missions near one another's fleets, conduct themselves when they detect disaster in another fleet.</p>
        <p>Two United States submarines, the Memphis and, according to some reports, the Toledo, were monitoring the military maneuvers in which the Kursk was participating last month when two explosions disabled and sunk the Kursk, a 490-foot attack submarine. Senior American officials have said that the American vessels lingered in the area and monitored Russian radio transmissions in the frantic early stages of the search-and-rescue operation before leaving the area. A few American submarines on intelligence missions have been known to carry deep-sea divers and small submersibles, but these officials have said the American boats on this occasion were not equipped to help.</p>
        <p>Officials in Washington said they were unaware of Mr. Putin's proposal, adding that Mr. Putin did not raise it during his meeting with Mr. Clinton in New York.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has declined so far to publicly discuss the mission of the American submarines or how American forces might help a foreign submarine in distress. This week, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, turned over an unclassified analysis of sonar data collected at the time of the explosions that scuttled the Kursk to Sergei Ivanov, his Russian counterpart.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klebanov, speaking in the interview, said that the American information turned over in New York was ''seismological'' in nature and that it conformed with earlier information supplied by Norway. However, he said, Russian sonar specialists differ in their interpretation of the information, believing that the first of two explosions recorded on Aug. 12 could have been the sound of a collision or of a mine detonating. Russian specialists also believe that any vessel that collided with the Kursk, disabling it and sending it careering to the bottom, could have survived such a collision and then slipped away.</p>
        <p>The deputy prime minister, an engineer who oversees Russia's huge military industrial complex, also confirmed reports that the force of the second explosion blew away much of the bow and torpedo compartment. Mr. Klebanov said a crucial problem of the investigation is that the second explosion may have obliterated some of the evidence of whether the Kursk was struck by another vessel or a mine.</p>
        <p>''The second explosion greatly distorted the first cause,'' he said, adding, ''we have elements of the inner hull bent inside'' indicating an external blow, ''and we have metal bent outside,'' indicating an internal explosion breaking through the hull.</p>
        <p>''This is why we cannot abandon the version that a collision occurred,'' he said, ''because we have parts bent to the inside.''</p>
        <p>He also elaborated on Mr. Putin's remarks in New York about the analysis of tapping noises. The navy's tapes of the tapping noises on the hull revealed ''clear, rhythmic sounds,'' but when they were subjected to ''multiple computer processing,'' he added, ''we can say with a large degree of probability that it was mechanical tapping, not by a man, but it was noise from a mechanism whose nature we cannot establish, but almost for sure we defined that those signals were not emitted by live crew members.'' He said the noises stopped just before noon on Aug. 14.</p>
        <p>Also today, Russian officials denied a report in a German newspaper suggesting that the Kursk was struck by a missile from the cruiser Peter the Great.</p>
        <p>All weapons fired during Russian military exercises carry dummy warheads, Mr. Klebanov said. He also clarified that at the time of the accident, the Kursk was preparing to fire a standard torpedo that was equipped with a dummy warhead. However, he added, the Kursk was equipped with a normal complement of live torpedoes and other conventional missiles carrying high-explosive warheads.</p>
        <p>The torpedo that the Kursk was preparing to fire was of the Squall type that has been in the fleet for 20 years and was equipped only with a new battery that had been subjected to earlier testing, he said.</p>
        <p>American Navy officers have said that handling errors and flaws involving torpedoes have created dangerous situations on other submarines. Some former Navy officials believe that the explosion of a torpedo battery caused the loss of the American submarine Scorpion and its 99-man crew in 1968.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klebanov also disclosed that Russian rescue vessels actually docked 18 times on the Kursk's rear outer hatch in vain attempts to create an air-tight corridor that would have allowed them to open the inner hatch to the submarine compartment below, but damage to the seal around the hatch and flooding inside the submarine doomed this final pathway into the submarine.</p>
        <p>Crew recovery operations begin at the end of this month, with large holes to be cut in the Kursk's hull. But Mr. Klebanov said a decision on whether to cut into the reactor compartment is still under study. He said radiation levels remain normal on and around the wrecked vessel.</p>
