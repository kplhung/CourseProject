        <p>First thing this morning, Gov. George W. Bush stared out at a group of workers and said, ''I have a confession to make. I'm here to ask for your vote.''</p>

        <p>First thing this morning, Gov. George W. Bush stared out at a group of workers and said, ''I have a confession to make. I'm here to ask for your vote.''</p>
        <p>He described how he had run for Congress from Texas in 1978 and ''came in second in a two-person race.'' A woman came up to him in his hometown afterwards and told him she had not voted for him. ''And I said, 'Well, why not?' '' Mr. Bush recalled, ''and she said, 'Because you didn't bother to ask for my vote.' ''</p>
        <p>So today George Bush was asking.</p>
        <p>It was the debut of the more accessible style that the governor had promised as a way of addressing concerns among prominent Republicans and even some of his own aides that his campaign was slipping in the polls. For the first time since the Republican primaries, Mr. Bush held a sustained question and answer session with voters, running longer than some recent campaign events.</p>
        <p>At the same time the Republican National Committee unveiled its  strongest commercial yet against Vice President Al Gore in a drive to make voters doubt the Democrat's credibility.</p>
        <p>In the commercial a woman announcer speaks of Mr. Gore's pledge to overhaul the nation's campaign finance system and then runs through a litany of the indictments and unanswered Congressional subpoenas resulting from the campaign finance abuses of 1996 when the Democratic National Committee returned several million dollars in contributions because of questions about the money's origins.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore's promising campaign finance reform,'' the announcer says. ''Can I believe him? Because of Gore's last fund-raising campaign, 22 people have been indicted, 12 convicted, 70 took the Fifth Amendment, and 18 witnesses fled the country.'' The advertisement then goes on to cast doubt on Mr. Gore's proposals for school accountability and ends, ''Just more politics from Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>The juxtaposition of Mr. Bush's new style and the advertisement showed how the campaign is seeking to move ahead: plant questions about Mr. Gore's credibility and the validity of his promises and then showcase Mr. Bush in informal settings open and accessible and speaking of ''real plans for real people.''</p>
        <p>Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, said of the commercial: ''I think it highlights a fundamental question of the election and that is: if you can't trust the vice president's credibility on an issue like campaign finance reform, how you can trust his credibility on an issue like education reform?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's visit to the Marconi Communications company, about a half-hour's drive outside Pittsburgh, had been planned as a venue for Mr. Bush to speak in a swing state about his plan to divert some of the Social Security payroll tax into private investment accounts as a way to refashion the program for the retirement of the baby boom generation.</p>
        <p>''Instead of being a retirement system gone bust, it's a retirement system that's robust,'' he rhymed.</p>
        <p>In keeping with his decision to get closer to the people, Mr. Bush headed quickly to the company cafeteria, where he bought a cup of coffee and began greeting employees who applauded him from their tables. And after his prepared remarks to a group of employees, he took an array of questions, talking of his relations with the news media and with Democrats, his efforts to give the golden cheek warbler a place to nest on his Texas ranch, his tax policy and plans for education.</p>
        <p>His first questioner was almost inaudible, but it was clear that he did not think that journalists portrayed Mr. Bush fairly.</p>
        <p>''I respect the media,'' Mr. Bush replied, but then he suggested that he would not dare say otherwise, noting, ''Of course, it's about 60 days before the election.''</p>
        <p>''I do'' respect the news media, he emphasized. ''I think it's been fair to me. But the best way for me to get my message out is to speak directly to the people.''</p>
        <p>When another man wanted to know about Mr. Bush's relations with Democrats, he spoke about working with Bob Bullock, the late Democratic lieutenant governor of Texas.</p>
        <p>''We had a rocky relationship at times, but let me tell you how it ended,'' Mr. Bush said. He said he had gone on his very first campaign trip to Iowa and New Hampshire, ''and I came back and this good man was on his death bed and he asked me to eulogize him at his funeral. It was one of the most touching moments I've had in my life, frankly.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush talked at length, gesturing emphatically, about his ideas to bring more testing and accountability in schools. ''It's kind of a long-winded answer,'' he said, ''but it's my passion. Thanks for the question.''</p>
        <p>By the time it was over, his audience had also learned that he is keeping a grove of cedars standing on his ranch because the golden cheek warbler nests in them -- though he said he would not want the federal government ordering such environmental steps by fiat. And he also told of his commitment to tax cutting in good times and bad.</p>
        <p>''If we ever went into a recession -- which I certainly hope we do not do and I don't think we will -- I'm going to increase the pace of tax relief,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The best way to grow out of a recession is to accelerate tax relief to people.''</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Bush announced that he had won the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, and held an airport rally, opposing Mr. Gore's populist cry that the vice president is ''for the people, not for the powerful'' with some populism of his own. Mr. Bush showcased people who would get substantial tax cuts under his plan to cut taxes by $1.3 trillion, but little under Mr. Gore's tax cut plan.</p>
        <p>''Now you tell me, Who's standing on the side of the people?'' Mr. Bush said. ''You tell me, Whose plan is a real plan with real solutions? It's our plan. It's our plan.''</p>
