        <p>The Bureau of Indian Affairs marked its 175th anniversary today in a ceremony that blended sorrow, hope and a remarkable apology from the bureau's director.</p>
        <p>''In truth, this is no occasion for celebration,'' said Kevin Gover, the assistant interior secretary who heads the bureau. Instead, he said, it was a time ''for sorrowful truths to be spoken, a time for contrition.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gover said he was apologizing to American Indians on behalf of the bureau, not the government as a whole, though White House officials saw an advance copy of the statement and did not object.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gover recounted the bureau's evolution from a War Department office that dealt with what white Americans regarded as the ''Indian problem'' to an Interior Department agency entrusted with promoting tribal autonomy and improving the lives of Indians.</p>
        <p>In forcing Indians from their land and trying to stamp out their cultures and languages, ''this agency participated in the ethnic cleansing that befell the Western tribes,'' Mr. Gover said. Even after its mission changed, he said, the bureau made little headway against the alcoholism, drug abuse and domestic violence that afflict Indian life.</p>
        <p>''Let us begin by expressing our profound sorrow for what the agency has done in the past,'' he said, then offered a formal apology to Indians.</p>
        <p>What made his gesture remarkable is that Mr. Gover is himself a member of the Pawnee tribe. ''I realized it was partly for me,'' he said later of his statement.</p>
        <p>His voice faltered as he spoke of ''the decimation of the mighty bison herds, the use of the poison alcohol to destroy mind and body, and the cowardly killing of women and children.'' Such suffering, he said, ''made for tragedy on a scale so ghastly that it cannot be dismissed as merely the inevitable consequence of the clash of competing ways of life.''</p>
        <p>In a way, Mr. Gover, who is 45, stood as a bridge between two societies. He came from a poor family in Lawton, Okla., and went to Princeton with the help of federal scholarship aid. He earned a degree in public and international affairs, then graduated from the University of New Mexico law school.</p>
        <p>Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt also spoke, calling the bureau ''a work in progress,'' but one that now belongs to Indians, who make up most of its 10,000 employees. ''May you prosper, grow, advocate, get under people's skins,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The bureau was founded in 1824, so its 175th anniversary was actually last year. But the observance was postponed to avoid being overshadowed by the Interior Department's 150th anniversary, also in 1999.</p>
        <p>The ceremony today reflected how Indian culture has endured and how it has been assimilated. Numerous tribal leaders were present. Some wore traditional jewelry and headbands, but many others wore dark business suits.</p>
        <p>''By accepting the legacy,'' Mr. Gover said, ''we accept the moral responsibility of putting things right.''</p>
