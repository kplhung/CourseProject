        <p>Today's KEY GAMES</p>
        <p>NO. 1 NEBRASKA 1-0  NO. 23 at NOTRE DAME 1-0  Notre Dame, improved this year, held favored Texas A&amp;M to 255 yards last Saturday. The Irish face a stiffer test against Nebraska, which rolled up 596 yards (505 rushing) against San Jose State. Still, Coach Bob Davie of Notre Dame, said: ''With a young quarterback and a not-real-confident defense, I think we showed a solid foundation on which to build.''  TV: NBC, 2:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>NO. 4 MIAMI 1-0  NO. 15 at WASHINGTON 1-0  Two offensive powerhouses. Washington's quarterback, Marques Tuiasosopo, passed for 223 yards and ran for 80 against Idaho and his teammates collected four fumble recoveries, an interception and a blocked punt. TV: ABC, 3:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>NO. 2 FLORIDA STATE 1-0  vs. GEORGIA TECH 1-0  Florida State held Brigham Young to minus-2 yards rushing. Georgia Tech is better than it showed against Central Florida, when it needed two touchdown passes in the last four minutes to win.TV: ABC, 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>OTHER GAMES</p>
        <p>EAST  Louisiana Tech (1-1)  at Penn State (0-2)  Penn State rushed for only 6 yards against Southern California and 30 against Toledo. Tailback Larry Johnson says the fault is in using the same system for years.</p>
        <p>Boston College (0-1)  at Army (0-1)  Both have struggling offenses. Boston College has better talent.</p>
        <p>Buffalo (0-1)  at Rutgers (1-0)  Rutgers, with a creative passing game, may become a decent team.</p>
        <p>SOUTH  No. 9 Georgia (1-0)  at South Carolina (1-0)  South Carolina ended its 21-game losing streak just in time.  TV: ESPN2, 3:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>Vanderbilt (0-1)  at No. 13 Alabama (0-1)  Alabama couldn't handle U.C.L.A.'s blitz. This should be more comfortable.</p>
        <p>MIDWEST  Oregon (1-0)  at No. 5 Wisconsin (1-0)  Wisconsin, with players serving N.C.A.A. suspensions, must step up against an aggressive defense.</p>
        <p>Rice (1-0)  at No. 3 Michigan (1-0)  John Navarre, who had never taken a college snap, threw four touchdown passes for Michigan against Bowling Green.  TV: CH9, Noon</p>
        <p>Marshall (1-0)  at No. 24 Michigan State (0-0)  This figures to be the end of Marshall's 18-game winning streak, the best in Division I-AA.  TV: ESPN, Noon</p>
        <p>Syracuse (1-0)  at Cincinnatti (1-0)  Syracuse's running game should thrive, even after fullback Kyle Johnson's surgery for a broken ankle.  TV: MSG, 3:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>FAR WEST  Colorado (0-1)  at No. 11 So. California (1-0)  The Colorado offense, which gained 532 yards in a loss to Colorado State, faces a Trojan defense that held Penn State to 10 first downs.</p>
        <p>No.18 Ohio State (1-0)  at Arizona (1-0)  Ohio State's defense (four touchdowns against Fresno State) appears too strong.  TV: FSNY, Noon</p>
        <p>Fresno State (0-1)  at No. 16 U.C.L.A. (1-0)  Ryan McCann is U.C.L.A.'s quarterback because Cory Paus separated his throwing shoulder on the first play against Alabama.</p>
        <p>No. 22 Texas Christian (0-0)  at Nevada (0-1)  More woes for Nevada, which totaled minus-3 yards rushing against Oregon.</p>
        <p>No. 21 Illinois (1-0)  at San Diego State (0-1)  Should be easy for Illinois, which stopped Middle Tennessee three times inside the 10-yard line.  TV: ESPN2, 10 p.m.</p>
        <p>MISMATCHES  Louisiana-Lafayette (0-1)  at No. 6 Texas (0-0)  Texas, with Chris Simms or Major Applewhite or both at quarterback, is a heavy favorite.</p>
        <p>Middle Tennessee (0-1)  at No. 8 Florida (1-0)  Florida was so mediocre against Ball State that the Gator fans booed their team, leading Coach Steve Spurrier to say, ''We won't be too full of ourselves after this one.''</p>
        <p>Kent (0-1)  at No. 14 Purdue (1-0)  Purdue held Central Michigan to 161 yards and could do it again.</p>
        <p>Arkansas State (0-1)  at No. 20 Oklahoma (1-0)  In routing Texas-El Paso, Oklahoma turned seven turnovers into five touchdowns.</p>
