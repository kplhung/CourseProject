        <p>Some critics have complained that there's no difference between the two major parties. If music can be any indication, they may be right. Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have picked nearly identical songs as their theme music for the presidential campaigns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has chosen ''Let the Day Begin,'' a rock number by the Call. Mr. Bush uses ''We the People,'' which was written for his campaign by Billy Ray Cyrus. Both are anthems to workers and strivers, drivers and dreamers, Americans of all stripe, leaving no one behind or out.</p>

        <p>Some critics have complained that there's no difference between the two major parties. If music can be any indication, they may be right. Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have picked nearly identical songs as their theme music for the presidential campaigns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has chosen ''Let the Day Begin,'' a rock number by the Call. Mr. Bush uses ''We the People,'' which was written for his campaign by Billy Ray Cyrus. Both are anthems to workers and strivers, drivers and dreamers, Americans of all stripe, leaving no one behind or out.</p>
        <p>The lyrics to the Democrats' tune go like this:</p>
        <p>''Here's to the babies in a brand-new world. Here's to the beauty and the stars. Here's to the travelers on the open road. Here's to the dreamers in the bars. Here's to the teachers in the crowded rooms. Here's to the workers in the field. Here's to the preachers of the sacred word. Here's to the drivers at the wheel.''</p>
        <p>And more:</p>
        <p>''Here's to the winners of the human race. Here's to the losers in the game. Here's to the soldiers of the bitter war. Here's to the war that bears their name.''</p>
        <p>And the Republicans' lyrics?</p>
        <p>''The farmers rise every morning at 5. The truckers drive them 18-wheelers all night. The factory workers, they build it with pride, 24/7 down the assembly line.'' In its attempt to honor workers of all sorts, it also says: ''Here's to every salesman on the telephone line.''</p>
        <p>And it comes with a warning:</p>
        <p>''We pay the taxes, we pay the bills, so they better pay attention up on Capitol Hill.''</p>
        <p>Both campaigns said they wanted to reach the common folk. Both also officially unveiled their theme songs at their conventions.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Gore fancies himself a music buff, he was not involved in the selection. He was busy writing his convention speech when a handful of aides sat down and systematically evaluated the available repertoire, including Tina Turner's hit,  ''Simply the Best.''</p>
        <p>Greg Simon, a senior Gore adviser and onetime drummer with a band, said, ''It talks about all corners of society -- and you can dance to it.''</p>
        <p>The campaign did not call the Call in advance to see if Mr. Gore could appropriate the tune, but Michael Been, the composer, has said in published reports that he has no objection.</p>
        <p>Gore's Son's Surgeon Hailed</p>
        <p>At a rally in New Orleans on Thursday night, Mr. Gore called Dr. David G. Kline to join him on the stage. Mr. Gore said vaguely that ''one of our children had a health issue'' and that Dr. Kline had come to the rescue. Dr. Kline flitted on and off the stage in the blink of an eye, without further explanation.</p>
        <p>Tracked down behind the stage later, Dr. Kline said he was the neurosurgeon who had operated on Mr. Gore's son, Albert III, in 1989 after he had been hit by a car in Baltimore and severely injured. ''After his acute care there, he needed reconstruction of the nerves in the right arm,'' said Dr. Kline, who is chairman of neurosurgery at Louisiana State University Medical School.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kline used a procedure he pioneered to examine the nerves by putting electrodes on them. The testing told the doctors that the nerves were slowly growing back, something that was not otherwise visible. ''If you looked at him clinically, you probably would have gone in and chopped them out, and that would not have been good,'' he said. ''We were able to clean them up, and God and Mother Nature and Albert regrew them.'' Albert, a senior in high school, has fully recovered and plays vigorous sports.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kline kept up with the Gores when their oldest daughter, Karenna, worked as an intern at The Times-Picayune. When Gore aides called him earlier this week to invite him to the rally in the French Quarter, Dr. Kline was not surprised. But he was when Mr. Gore called out his name to come up on the stage.</p>
        <p>''I had no idea about this,'' he said. ''I'm not sure I would have come if I had known that. I thought it was very unusual. It was very nice of them to do that. It's hard to talk about, but I'm very busy and in my own little field, very well known, so I don't need publicity. But it was very, very nice of them.''</p>
        <p>He said he generally votes Republican and had contributed money to the Republican Party, but this time he planned to vote for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Raising Big Money</p>
        <p>With a new Republican commercial lambasting Mr. Gore for attending a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in 1996, Mr. Gore was asked in a radio interview today what lessons he might have learned from that experience.</p>
        <p>''Have you learned anything?'' he was asked by WBRZ, the ABC radio affiliate in Baton Rouge, La. ''Oh sure,'' Mr. Gore responded. ''I support campaign finance reform, and I think it's obvious to one and all that it's needed now more than ever.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore then headed to two fund-raisers for the Democratic National Committee in Atlanta, where he hoped to raise $1 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is to attend a string of multimillion-dollar fund-raisers next week. He hits Philadelphia on Tuesday, Boston on Wednesday, and New York on Thursday for a star-studded gala at Radio City Music Hall.</p>
