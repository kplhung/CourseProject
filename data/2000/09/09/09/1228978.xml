        <p>A panel of experts assessing human rights and political life in Austria cleared the way today for the European Union to lift diplomatic sanctions that were hurriedly imposed last January after the Austrians allowed a far-right party into national government.</p>
        <p>The panel's recommendation to end the sanctions, which it said had become counterproductive, allows the European Union to wriggle free of measures that have become an increasing embarrassment. In particular, the sanctions had threatened to strengthen opposition to the Union, and the common European currency, in a crucial referendum on the euro in Denmark this month.</p>
        <p>The experts handed their report today to President Jacques Chirac of France, the current holder of the Union's rotating presidency, and gave high marks to the Austrian government, concluding that minorities, refugees and immigrants enjoy as many rights and protections in Austria -- if not more -- as their counterparts elsewhere in the 15-member European Union.</p>
        <p>But the report went some way to saving face for those -- like Mr. Chirac -- who advocated the sanctions by criticizing the far-right Freedom Party, whose admission into government prompted the measures. Without naming the party's former leader, Jorg Haider, the report concluded that some Freedom Party members are still using xenophobic language and are bombarding critics with libel suits in a strategy aimed at silencing them.</p>
        <p>Even when the sanctions -- which included boycotts of school trips, cultural exchanges and military exercises -- were hurriedly imposed on Jan. 31, there were critics who said the measures went too far. Although they have amounted to little more than a crimp in the social life of Austrian ambassadors, they represented an unparalleled intrusion in the internal affairs of a member country and they infuriated the Austrians, who have been demanding that they be rescinded.</p>
        <p>Although the measures were adopted unanimously by the other European Union members, enthusiasm for them waned quickly. Only a few countries, including France, have remained adamant. In recent months, the European Commission has tried to broker a face-saving mechanism for backing down.</p>
        <p>In July, they appointed the three-member panel of ''wise men,'' which was asked to study Austria's human rights record and the political nature of the Freedom Party before making a recommendation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac, however, has repeatedly refused to say that he would follow the panel's recommendation. Today, he accepted the report from Prof. Jochen Frowein, the director of the Max Planck Institute in Germany, former President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland and Marcelino Oreja, a former Spanish government minister, but offered no further comment. His spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said he would consult with the other member countries about what ''follow-up steps to take.''</p>
        <p>Still, many experts believe that the sanctions are now firmly on their way out. For one thing, even France has good reason to want to get rid of them.</p>
        <p>France has just taken over the rotating six-month presidency of the European Union and faces a difficult agenda. Both its prestige and, perhaps, even the timely expansion of the Union are riding on its ability to broker deals on how to overhaul the Union's institutions. With more than a dozen countries heading toward membership, the European Union must remake its various bodies or face paralysis. With such issues to solve before the end of the year, the French are unlikely to want to be encouraging tensions between members.</p>
        <p>Moreover, many critics have pointed out that Mr. Chirac's enthusiastic denunciations of Austria's Freedom Party played well at home, where he is already trying to position himself for the 2002 presidential race.</p>
        <p>But they did not play well in countries such as Denmark, something of a traditional maverick in the European Union and a nation already wary of the treatment smaller member countries will receive from the Union. Some experts believe that lifting the boycott -- or at least indicating that it will end -- could help make sure that Danes vote to adopt the euro when the issue goes to a referendum on Sept. 28.</p>
        <p>As the report became public, Austrian officials quickly called for the sanctions to be lifted. Karl-Heinz Grasser, the Austrian finance minister and a Freedom Party member, said the decision should be taken before an informal summit meeting of European Union leaders in Biarritz, France, on Oct. 13 and 14.</p>
        <p>''They were imposed in one day,'' Mr. Grasser said of the sanctions. ''They can be lifted swiftly.''</p>
        <p>The 45-page report concludes that the sanctions have served a useful purpose by focusing attention on common values within the European Union and by pushing the Austrian government to take a hard look at itself and its behavior.</p>
        <p>But it also said that the sanctions now risked causing more harm than good. ''If the measures adopted by the 14 member states are maintained, the effect will be counterproductive,'' the report said. ''The measures have already generated nationalist sentiments in Austria, above all because they have sometimes been wrongly interpreted as sanctions against the Austrian people.''</p>
        <p>The current Austrian government coalition was formed by Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel of the conventionally conservative Austrian People's Party to end months of political stalemate following October elections. The government won praise from the panel for ''fulfilling its commitment to European values'' by taking concrete steps to fight racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism.</p>
        <p>But the report was far more critical of the Freedom Party, which was led by Mr. Haider until he stepped aside in February, in part to ease the criticisms of Austria. It described the party as a ''right-wing populist party with radical elements.''</p>
        <p>While the report found that there was ''nothing seriously objectionable about'' most of the party members who were in government, it said that some members outside of the government had used xenophobic, even racist language and were not reproached in any way.</p>
        <p>''It has been demonstrated that the party has taken no measures against members of the party who use xenophobic language in public. It has neither punished them or chastised them. Nor has it apologized for them.''</p>
