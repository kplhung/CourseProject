        <p>Venturing deep into Gov. George W. Bush's home state, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman today painted a dismal picture of Mr. Bush's record on children's health care, and said the governor could not be trusted with the issue on a national scale.</p>
        <p>''Texas actually ranks 49th of 50 states in providing health insurance for kids,'' Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, said at a forum here.

        <p>Venturing deep into Gov. George W. Bush's home state, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman today painted a dismal picture of Mr. Bush's record on children's health care, and said the governor could not be trusted with the issue on a national scale.</p>
        <p>''Texas actually ranks 49th of 50 states in providing health insurance for kids,'' Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, said at a forum here. ''In this campaign, Governor Bush may say that he has a plan to improve children's health across America. But I think we have a right to ask, why hasn't he done it in Texas?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman and his running mate, Vice President Al Gore, have made health care a central issue of the campaign, promising to provide coverage for all of the nation's 11 million uninsured children by 2004 and prescription drug coverage for older people under Medicare. Buoyed by opinion polls showing that the public sees health care as a matter better handled by the Democrats, they have charged that Mr. Bush would endanger Medicare's financial stability and that his promises to improve health care are hollow.</p>
        <p>The senator's foray into Texas -- along with another he plans to make on Monday -- is a vivid sign of the confidence the Democrats have found in the last month. They have remained steadily on the offensive, particularly on health care, and are sure enough of their standing in traditionally Democratic states to send Mr. Lieberman into a state that is sure to be a Republican stronghold.</p>
        <p>Today's remarks by Mr. Lieberman may have been the harshest yet in this campaign, reinforcing the role he is playing as the Democrats' leading attacker. He charged that under Mr. Bush, Texas had done a bad job of enrolling children in federally financed health care plans, and that the state had erected bureaucratic hurdles that make it hard for qualified people to get those benefits.</p>
        <p>He cited a ruling by a federal judge last month that Texas had failed to provide adequate care for children on Medicaid, the health program for the poor, in violation of a 1996 agreement with the Bush administration. The state is appealing.</p>
        <p>''Governor Bush has just not made children's health coverage and care a priority,'' the senator said at the Magnolia Multi-Service Center, in a heavily Hispanic neighborhood here. ''More than 1.4 million children in Texas do not have health insurance.''</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, did not dispute the figures cited by Mr. Lieberman, but he said they stemmed from problems Mr. Bush inherited when he became governor in 1995. And he argued that the state found it hard to enroll people in benefit programs because ''there is a belief in Texas to scorn government assistance.''</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Bush's predecessor, Ann Richards, a Democrat, ''We were 49th then, too,'' Mr. Bartlett added. ''The challenges in Texas are not something that are new in the last few years.''</p>
        <p>But the focus of Mr. Lieberman's remarks, the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, is new. It was created in 1997 by Congress and President Clinton, providing federal money to the states to cover uninsured children from low-income families, and giving the states responsibility for designing their own programs and enrolling people.</p>
        <p>Texas has been one of the slowest states in signing up poor children for the program; the Children's Defense Fund ranked its efforts 45th among the states. Figures compiled by the Health Care Financing Authority, a federal agency, show Texas had 51,000 children enrolled as of a year ago, about one-third the national rate, compared with 521,000 in New York, the state with the largest program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bartlett said that the creation of a CHIP program in Texas was delayed because the Legislature meets only every other year. Texas officials say the state's enrollment is up to 90,000 children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman interviewed working parents here, some with toddlers squirming on their laps, who told of being unable to find coverage for their children. ''We had to choose between transportation and insurance,'' Rosalinda Camarillo said, adding that she had postponed surgery for her 9-year-old son for a year.</p>
        <p>Several parents said they had been wrongly denied Medicaid coverage, or had their benefits terminated. ''This state administration has kept in place a very cumbersome bureaucratic red tape that has kept 600,000 eligible children from enrolling in Medicaid,'' Mr. Lieberman said. Mr. Bartlett said the eligibility rules in Texas go back two decades, and that the state is reviewing them.</p>
        <p>The Children's Defense Fund reported last month that Texas was one of only eight states where the number of children with any form of health insurance declined from 1997 to 1999, despite CHIP, a charge Mr. Lieberman repeated today.</p>
