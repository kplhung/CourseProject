        <p>Rutgers has a big football game Saturday night. Not big in a national powerhouse kind of way. The Scarlet Knights took one small, but precious, step forward last week. Now they can take another.</p>
        <p>''We are not even close to being the type of team we need to be,'' Coach Terry Shea said.</p>
        <p>If Rutgers can beat Buffalo in the 6 p.m. nonconference game at home, the Scarlet Knights will be 2-0. The Scarlet Knights have not been 2-0 in six years. They have not even won two games in a row in two years.</p>
        <p>Rutgers is favored to beat Buffalo by more than three touchdowns. Mike McMahon, the senior quarterback, cannot remember the last time the Scarlet Knights were picked to win a game by such a large margin.</p>
        <p>''I've never paid any attention to the odds when I was on the other side, and I'm not paying any attention now,'' Shea said.</p>
        <p>Villanova, Rutgers's victim last week, is a Division I-AA team, and Buffalo, without a victory in its first Division I-A season last year, was clobbered by Syracuse last week, 63-7.</p>
        <p>But Rutgers has the opportunity to gather some steam heading into next week's game at Virginia Tech. This kind of roll has been rare at Rutgers, which has won only eight games in the last four years.</p>
        <p>''We're not a team that can take any other team lightly,'' McMahon said.</p>
        <p>McMahon is coming off the most impressive performance of his college career.</p>
        <p>He tied a 31-year-old school record by throwing five touchdown passes against Villanova, and he finished with 323 yards passing. The record and the other statistics tell only part of the story.</p>
        <p>Last October, McMahon, who is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 215 pounds and likes to wear his hair in a bleached shock, was not sure he would play football again. He dived for a touchdown to tie a game against Virginia Tech and injured his right shoulder.</p>
        <p>Two weeks later he had surgery. He did not throw a football hard until June, and then he was saddled by soreness and tightness in his shoulder during training camp.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't quite used to throwing that much again,'' he said.</p>
        <p>An examination showed that his shoulder was sore and tight but not damaged. McMahon completed passes to nine receivers against Villanova, and the 13-point margin of victory was the biggest for Rutgers since Shea became coach in 1996.</p>
        <p>''We are getting off the bus throwing the football,'' Shea said. ''That's who we are.''</p>
        <p>McMahon said he was not surprised with how well he played against Villanova. He was convinced he should have played better. He said he should have completed more than 27 passes because he missed some receivers.</p>
        <p>''It was definitely fun for a first game,'' he said, ''but I hope it grows from there.''</p>
        <p>Now McMahon and his teammates think they have enough talent to get to a bowl game. That may sound audacious coming from a team that won only one game last season, but McMahon is not joking. Last year's team was hounded by injuries and finished the season in a fog.</p>
        <p>''A lot of guys just rolled up and sat back,'' McMahon said.</p>
        <p>This season has a long way to go, but the Scarlet Knights are hopeful that disaster will not strike again. More players stayed near the campus to work out during the summer, and, as a result, not as many players got hurt during camp.</p>
        <p>The team has a much more favorable schedule. Rutgers exchanged California and Texas for Villanova and Buffalo.</p>
        <p>The Scarlet Knights are excited about the Virginia Tech game, and they think they will have a better chance against Michael Vick, the Hokies quarterback, if they beat Buffalo.</p>
        <p>So there was a reason Shea made the Buffalo Bulls sound more like the Buffalo Bills this week.</p>
        <p>''When they roll out here, you're going to say, 'Hey, these guys are definitely Division I-A,' '' Shea said.</p>
