        <p>The combative tone of the Senate campaign in New York has escalated this week with an exchange of television and radio advertisements as the candidates battle to redefine their own images and those of the opponent.</p>
        <p>Altogether, the campaigns and their supporters in the past 10 days have released nearly a half-dozen ads, most of them critical, in a back-and-forth duel between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Both sides promised more to come -- and exchanged blame for negativity -- as polls continued to show the candidates in a virtual dead heat, with many people undecided. Although the candidates are rarely as harsh on the stump, the bitter tenor left the campaigns wondering yesterday what to expect in the first debate of the Senate race, which is scheduled for Wednesday in Buffalo.</p>
        <p>Michael Murphy, Mr. Lazio's chief strategist, said the campaign had to respond to Mrs. Clinton,  ''when she airs just a whopper of a lie or distortion.'' Mr. Murphy is the architect of the candidate's ads, including a new series asking whether voters can trust Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''The big difference between Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party and the ads Rick Lazio is running is each of our ads are based on substantive issues,'' countered Peter Kauffman, a spokesman for the state Democratic Party, which has run a set of attack ads on Mrs. Clinton's behalf. ''When they run an ad, it attacks Hillary personally.''</p>
        <p>Two advertisements were announced yesterday, one by the state Democratic Party and the other by the state Republican Party, the first it has created on Mr. Lazio's behalf. Both take a pointed look at their respective candidates' opponents.</p>
        <p>The Democratic television ad, which began appearing yesterday, reprises a ''man in the street'' style that the party used in another ad released last week that purported to show everyday New Yorkers reacting in shock and dismay at Mr. Lazio's positions on health care and other topics. In the new ad, people react negatively as an off-camera narrator questions Mr. Lazio's support for education.</p>
        <p>The Republican Party released a tongue-in-cheek radio ad, to begin running in New York City on Monday, that attacks Mrs. Clinton's move to New York through a compilation of recorded snippets from her past speeches and news conferences. ''Chicago is my kind of town,'' she says in a recording from the 1996 Democratic National Convention, though the ad does not tell listeners that Chicago not only is her hometown, but was the site of the convention.</p>
        <p>No sooner was each ad released than the other side began to slam it. In the case of the Republican ad, the Democrats seized on the Republicans' decision to use ''soft money,'' largely unregulated donations. Mr. Lazio has criticized Mrs. Clinton for collecting millions of dollars in soft money, but the Republican radio ad gave Democrats ammunition to accuse him of hypocrisy. Both campaigns once again followed up the ads with e-mail messages to reporters and supporters, quarreling over who went negative first and pointing out what they said were inaccuracies in the opponent's ads.</p>
        <p>Political analysts were not surprised at the increasing vitriol. Mrs. Clinton, they noted, is seeking to reverse years of publicity that, according to several polls, has generated a negative impression among many voters, while Mr. Lazio is emerging from the obscurity of a Suffolk County Congressional seat.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, speaking at a fund-raiser last night in New York,  said that his wife had been unfairly accused of cashing in politically on her years in the White House.</p>
        <p>''Of all the things that her adversaries sometimes say, the thing that steams me the most is that she wouldn't be doing this if she weren't the first lady,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The president, who has intermittently come to his wife's political defense over the last few months, made his remarks at a $1,000-a-person cocktail party in SoHo. He said that he felt guilty when he first fell in love with Mrs. Clinton. ''I thought I was robbing her of the career that I felt she should have,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Regarding the two candidates' advertising, Jeffrey Stonecash, a political science professor at Syracuse University, said, ''Given that both of them have campaigns driven by trying to shape or reinforce an image of the other, there is going to be a lot of money spent on this and it is just going to keep on going.''</p>
        <p>Not all the ads will be broadcast statewide; some are having such a limited release -- a few stations, one or two days -- that they seem designed more to get attention from television stations and newspapers doing reports on them.</p>
        <p>Since the end of May, Mrs. Clinton has run 11 television and radio commercials; Mr. Lazio, 8; the Democratic Party, 7; and the Republican Party, 1. In addition, other groups like the New York Conservative Party and the Republican Leadership Council, which support Mr. Lazio, and the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, which supports Mrs. Clinton, have released advertisements.</p>
        <p>The campaigns did not believe the tone of these advertisements would turn off voters. ''I do believe people in TV land are able to make a fine distinction between an ad hitting somebody on their record and one hitting them on character,'' said a Clinton campaign official.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy characterized the flow of advertisements as a way to give a candidate controlled exposure, something Mr. Lazio desires with the electorate far more familiar with the first lady. ''The fact is, the local TV news guys will always put a cat who plays the piano on the TV news before anything on politics,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''We are forced to buy exposure.''</p>
        <p>The candidates themselves have been a little less acerbic toward one another on the campaign trail. They flick pointed barbs occasionally through news conferences, and did so yesterday about next week's debate.</p>
        <p>Sponsored by NBC News and The Buffalo News, the debate will be broadcast live at 7 p.m. on NBC affiliates in New York and shown again on the MSNBC cable channel at 10 p.m. A debate sponsored by WCBS-TV in New York City is scheduled for Oct. 8 and the campaign staffs are negotiating another.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, speaking to reporters after touring businesses in Westchester County, said he looked forward to the debate, and perhaps signaling what is to come, took the opportunity to criticize his opponent's campaign tactics.</p>
        <p>''I don't know where else the first lady comes from, except for attacking me and trying to distort my record; that's what she's been doing for most of this campaign,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''It would be wonderful if she didn't, if she just took a positive tack. But we'll wait and see.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, after touring an elementary school in Brooklyn, engaged in the time-tested strategy of lowering expectations about how she might do. ''My opponent has debated a lot and he's been on the floor of the House debating, so you know obviously I've never done it before,'' she said. ''I'm trying to get prepared but it's a totally new experience for me.''</p>
        <p>When the subject turned to the substance of the debate, however, she began sounding a bit like some of the harsh commercials made on her behalf.</p>
        <p>''He does a lot of talking but he doesn't actually deliver for New York,'' she said, rattling off a host of votes she contends Mr. Lazio did not support. ''He may score a debating point or two, but when it comes to  standing up for the children of New York, he's been missing in action.''</p>
