        <p>Iris Weinshall, a 20-year veteran of New York City government, was appointed commissioner of the Department of Transportation by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday. She succeeds Wilbur L. Chapman, who resigned in July to become police commissioner of Bridgeport, Conn.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weinshall, who since 1996 has been the first deputy commissioner of the city's Department of Citywide Administrative Services, ''is a proven leader, manager and administrator,'' Mr. Giuliani said at a City Hall news conference. Ms. Weinshall, who is married to Senator Charles E. Schumer, is a lifelong Brooklyn resident. She has served in senior posts at the city's Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>

        <p>Iris Weinshall, a 20-year veteran of New York City government, was appointed commissioner of the Department of Transportation by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday. She succeeds Wilbur L. Chapman, who resigned in July to become police commissioner of Bridgeport, Conn.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weinshall, who since 1996 has been the first deputy commissioner of the city's Department of Citywide Administrative Services, ''is a proven leader, manager and administrator,'' Mr. Giuliani said at a City Hall news conference. Ms. Weinshall, who is married to Senator Charles E. Schumer, is a lifelong Brooklyn resident. She has served in senior posts at the city's Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
        <p>Her appointment, which was widely anticipated, came after an exodus of the mayor's senior advisers from City Hall, particularly women and minorities. The departure of Mr. Chapman, who is black, had followed that of Richard T. Roberts, who is also black and was commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, and of Ninfa Segarra, a woman who was deputy mayor and is now one of the mayor's appointees to the Board of Education.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weinshall, who will oversee a staff of 3,917, will be responsible for transportation services ranging from road repairs to the Staten Island Ferry. Her annual salary in the new post is $150,500.</p>
        <p>While she was accompanied to City Hall by Mr. Schumer yesterday, Ms. Weinshall sought to dispel any suggestion that her husband's position had any influence on her appointment, saying the mayor ''has always made decisions on the merits.''</p>
        <p>Drawing a laugh from officials who attended the announcement, including Mr. Schumer, she said she had been appointed ''despite the baggage I carry, meaning my husband.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Weinshall, who has been married to Mr. Schumer for 20 years, said her career in city government had been ''kept pretty much separate'' from that of her husband.</p>
        <p>''We have been able to keep things in balance,'' she said.</p>
