        <p>Goldman Sachs Is In Talks To Acquire Spear, Leeds  Goldman Sachs Group, the investment banking firm, is in serious talks to acquire Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg, the biggest maker of markets in listed stocks and one of the biggest traders on the Nasdaq stock market, according to a person with knowledge of the talks.</p>
        <p>The purchase, if completed, would be Goldman Sachs's biggest since it went public in May 1999. Goldman has shown interest in acquiring one of the leading Nasdaq trading firms to increase its role in electronic trading of stocks, especially those of popular technology companies, such as Microsoft, Cisco Systems and WorldCom. [Page C4.]</p>
        <p>Brokerage Executive Pleads Guilty  Randolph Pace, a brokerage firm executive charged with enriching himself through a wide-ranging securities fraud conducted between 1994 and 1997, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to 13 felony counts of conspiracy, money laundering and securities fraud. Under the terms of his plea, Mr. Pace agreed to give $3 million immediately to the United States government. He is subject to additional fines, to be determined by the court, that will go into a restitution fund for investors who lost $200 million or more as a result of the conspiracy, prosecutors said.

        <p>Financier Is Sued By His Mother  Saul P. Steinberg, the chairman of Reliance Group Holdings, is being sued by his mother, who contends he owes her millions of dollars. Anne Steinberg filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan demanding that her son repay almost $5 million that she says he borrowed from her in 1997 and promised to repay on Dec. 31, 1999. [B1.]</p>
        <p>Verizon Announces Option Grant  Verizon Communications said that it would grant 210,000 employees options to buy 55 million shares of stock, giving them a stake in the carrier's financial performance. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Consultants Corner Voter Market  Aristotle International, a consulting firm, has compiled the nation's largest voter databank -- the names of 150 million Americans registered to vote. And it is selling them to politicians like George W. Bush, Joe Lieberman and John McCain in ways that many fear removes too much privacy from the voting booth. Aristotle has a client list that reads like a political convention: 45 senators, more than 200 members of the House, state parties and every major presidential candidate except Al Gore, whose campaign says it will not hire any firm whose practices could jeopardize the public's privacy. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Slow Profit Growth Stalls Markets  Stocks fell as evidence of slowing profit growth prompted investors to sell shares. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 119.94 points, or 2.9 percent, to 3,978.41. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.01 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,494.50. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 39.22 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,220.65. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Vote Renews Call for Electric Cars  California regulators voted to keep a rule requiring that 10 percent of cars offered for sale in the state starting in 2003 emit few or no pollutants, a goal the industry has said is unreachable. The unanimous decision by the California Air Resources Board, which regulates the state's air quality, is expected to increase the number of electric cars on the road, not only in California but in other states that have opted to follow California regulations.

        <p>Crude Oil Falls From 10-Year High  The price of crude oil fell from a 10-year high, after Saudi Arabia signaled that OPEC would agree to expand production to trim prices at a meeting this weekend in Vienna. Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, said Saudi Arabia wanted to bring prices down to $22 to $28 a barrel for the group's oil benchmark -- the price was $33.63 on Friday. OPEC is expected to increase daily supplies 500,000 to 800,000 barrels. [C3.]</p>
