        <p>Yasir Arafat had deadlines to meet. Take, for instance, the fact that he was planning to declare an independent Palestinian state this month.

        <p>Yasir Arafat had deadlines to meet. Take, for instance, the fact that he was planning to declare an independent Palestinian state this month. So perhaps such business spurred him to move up his flight to depart from New York from yesterday evening to noon. Or maybe he just missed home cooking.</p>
        <p>''We have to get the aircraft in,'' Sgt. Vito Asparro of the Port Authority police said soon after the Secret Service called to relay the last-minute change. ''We've got a major situation here.''</p>
        <p>By noon, Mr. Arafat's motorcade had left Midtown for Kennedy International Airport. That made Sergeant Asparro sweat. Since 1986, he has held the title of V.I.P. coordinator in charge of dignitary protection. For those who need an acronym refresher, Mr. Arafat qualifies as a V.I.P., as do the other 150 or so world leaders who flew into town this week for the United Nations Millennium Summit.</p>
        <p>This weekend, the airport faces the mass exodus. For Sergeant Asparro, that means spending the final days of summer in Hangar 12.</p>
        <p>All around him, telephones rang and computer screens spat out information. To keep him company, lots of dark-suited men paced the room -- Secret Service agents, State Department security personnel, police officers and Port Authority officials, and employees from federal agriculture, immigration and health agencies.</p>
        <p>Fifteen delegations left on Thursday night, and 80 others were scheduled to depart over the weekend. The rest had not made plans. At times like this, having plans and sticking to them could endear you for life to the sergeant.</p>
        <p>Last month, he went to the United Nations and spoke with representatives from most of the countries that would be sending delegates. He began listing the things that he needed the delegations to do to make his job easier. He spoke for more than 90 minutes, and he would have kept going if they had not pulled him off the stage.</p>
        <p>Of course, not everyone heeded the sergeant. For example, he asked the 50 world leaders who were flying in on their private planes to bring along tug planes to help pull aircraft along the tarmac. A few delegations showed up empty-handed.</p>
        <p>''It's delicate, it's delicate, and I would rather not say who it was,'' the sergeant said.</p>
        <p>The private planes ranged from giant Boeing 747's to 15-seat Gulfstream IV's. Saudi Arabia came in with a dozen planes. (''You're talking big, big magnitude,'' Sergeant Asparro said.)</p>
        <p>Whatever the size, all were parked at nearby military bases.</p>
        <p>The delegates who were catching commercial flights had to check in just like everybody else. Their motorcades had to pull up to the departure terminals rather than the runway, and they had to have their luggage X-rayed and tagged. What would happen if suitcases bound for Congo ended up in Iceland?</p>
        <p>The sergeant didn't want to think about that. At the moment, Mr. Arafat's motorcade was pulling up, and he had to find a waiting area fit for a V.I.P. After all, a stress-free mind always makes for better peace talks.</p>
