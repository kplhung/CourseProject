        <p>When the United States Senate convenes in 2001, a familiar face will be missing for the first time in 24 years. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the four-time senator from New York, is retiring, to be replaced by either Hillary Clinton or Rick Lazio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moynihan's political career seemed to break all the rules. He was a Democrat in the Nixon administration and leaped into the Senate from the ambassadorship at the United Nations, never before having held elective office.</p>
        <p>But he has been unusual in another respect as well. He is not only a professional politician; he is also an influential scholar, a Harvard social scientist with 18 books to his credit. The Almanac of American Politics calls him ''the nation's best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson.'' So as the tributes to a long and successful political career pour in, the question arises: How does Mr. Moynihan stack up as a scholar? What is his reputation among his academic peers?</p>
        <p>Mr. Moynihan's reputation at Harvard was not high when he arrived there in 1966. ''He was viewed by many people . . . as little more than a journalist,'' said Phyllis Keller, a former associate dean of the faculty at Harvard and a co-author, with the Brandeis historian Morton Keller, of the forthcoming ''Making Harvard Modern.'' Although he had a doctorate from Tufts University, Mr. Moynihan was not well trained in methodological techniques, and to this day he has rarely published in peer-reviewed journals.</p>
        <p>In a field where thorough data collection, rigorous statistical methods and careful scrutiny by one's peers are considered the hallmarks of quality, Mr. Moynihan continues to be spoken of as a flawed social scientist, even a lightweight. His writings on poverty and welfare, said Frances Fox Piven, a professor of political science at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, are shoddy. He is ''very clever and very wordy,'' she argues, but his linguistic facility obscures the fact ''that he has not made a positive contribution to public understanding of those topics.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Piven goes further: Mr. Moynihan's flaws as a scholar, in her view, result in large part from his direct involvement in government. Ever sensitive, she said, to the way the political winds were blowing, he tailored his analysis to the politics of the day and hence produced work that, almost by definition, could not last. James Q. Wilson, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, disagrees. He said that Mr. Moynihan's best books were written after he became a senator. ''Pandemonium,'' his study of ethnic conflict, foreshadowed what would happen in Eastern Europe after the collapse of Communism, Mr. Wilson said. A later book, ''Secrecy,'' called attention to the problem of government obfuscation, long ignored by political scientists. ''Pat gets engaged intellectually by getting engaged with real problems,'' Mr. Wilson observes. That doesn't happen ''if you sit around at the Harvard Faculty Club and argue over parking spaces.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson is not impressed by the methodological rigor so often praised by academic social scientists. ''Take the 20 best books in the social sciences written in the last 50 years,'' he said, ''and hardly any got their start as articles in refereed journals.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moynihan first achieved a scholarly reputation in 1963 when he wrote ''Beyond the Melting Pot'' with Nathan Glazer. Before ethnicity and race became major subjects of academic concern, these authors demonstrated the degree to which New York City's politics and social life resisted assimilation. William Julius Wilson, Malcolm Weiner professor of social policy at the Kennedy School of Harvard University, considers the book a  classic.</p>
        <p>Of all of Mr. Moynihan's social science writings, none have proved as controversial as his report on the black family. Issued in March 1965, when Mr. Moynihan was an assistant secretary of labor in the Johnson administration, ''The Negro Family: The Case for National Action'' argued that ''the breakdown of the Negro family has led to a startling increase in welfare dependency.'' Because the report urged that federal policy be directed toward strengthening the family (implying that enhanced welfare payments were not the solution), it stirred anger among liberals and leftists. And because Mr. Moynihan said that measures that ''would work for most groups . . . will not work here,'' he seemed to be saying that the problems facing the black family were more intractable than those facing any other group in the United States.</p>
        <p>Critics immediately denounced Mr. Moynihan's reasoning, data and recommendations. William Ryan, a psychologist teaching at the Harvard Medical School, attacked Mr. Moynihan's methodology in scathing tones in The Nation. ''No sophisticated social scientist,'' he wrote about the idea of family breakdown, ''would rest a broad concept on such crude and simplistic measures'' as out-of-wedlock births, for there were many forms the contemporary family could take. He said that Mr. Moynihan's methodology was filled with fantastic errors that led to stupefying statements. Mr. Moynihan had cause and effect backwards, Ryan argued. It was not the Negro family structure that caused poverty; it was poverty and racism that caused the absent-father syndrome that Mr. Moynihan mistook for family instability.</p>
        <p>To this day, Mr. Moynihan's critics point to ''The Negro Family'' as an example of what can go wrong when a social scientist is too close to power to appreciate what it means to live in a society that treats its poor and its minorities as second-class citizens. The report's analysis and findings, Ms. Piven maintains 35 years after its appearance, are ''not academically valid.'' Mr. Moynihan did not control for other variables that might explain welfare dependency, she said. The report received so much attention, Ms. Piven said, not because of its discoveries but because it fit the backlash conditions of the time. Mr. Moynihan may not have been a conservative, but his report, in her view, paved the way for the conservative attacks on welfare that followed.</p>
        <p>Yet precisely because the Moynihan report broke with the conventional wisdom of its time, others hail it as a milestone of social science research. ''Moynihan's study of the relationship between poverty and family structure,'' William Julius Wilson said, ''provided a framework for social scientific investigation that has -- especially since the mid-1980's, when research on the black poor was revived -- influenced research ideas and the development of research topics across social science disciplines.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson calls Mr. Moynihan's focus on the black family prophetic. Indeed, Mr. Moynihan, he said, can be credited with several firsts. He said that Mr. Moynihan was the first social scientist to recognize that poverty had become primarily an urban problem, and the first to call attention to the increasing gap between middle-class African-Americans and those living in inner-city conditions.</p>
        <p>''I think that Moynihan ranks among the most important social scientists in the country,'' Mr. Wilson continued. ''His writings provide a model for those who want to use social science research and knowledge to address issues of public policy.'' Mr. Wilson cited not only ''The Negro Family'' as a major contribution to social science, but also ''On Understanding Poverty,'' ''Maximum Feasible Misunderstanding,'' ''The Politics of a Guaranteed Income'' and ''Family and Nation.'' For him, neither Mr. Moynihan's lack of social science rigor nor his involvement in the affairs of the day stands in the way of achieving first-class status as a social scientist. Quite the contrary. Mr. Wilson says that if one wants to understand real-world conditions, real-world involvement can only be an advantage.</p>
        <p>One way to answer the question of how Mr. Moynihan's work should be judged is to turn to a person a generation behind the controversies that Mr. Moynihan generated in the 1960's. Such a person is Theda Skocpol, the Victor S. Thomas professor of government at Harvard, who has no evident personal or professional stake in the politics of Mr. Moynihan's reputation.</p>
        <p>''He is truly of a piece,'' Ms. Skocpol says, noting that Mr. Moynihan's taste for controversy has influenced both his political and his academic careers. She describes Mr. Moynihan's academic work as quirky. He can, she comments, go off half-baked with an idea. But at the same time, he has an extraordinary ability to dramatize an issue by ''putting his finger on things.'' That is what Mr. Moynihan did with his work on the black family, Ms. Skocpol said. His report ''performed a national service in dramatizing the issue of family structure,'' she said. ''Lots of people who care about inequality are fully aware of its contribution.''</p>
        <p>Would Mr. Moynihan's work qualify him for tenure in today's Harvard? She replies that it is a myth that the contemporary university has no place for public intellectuals. Harvard is full of people who do important scholarly work and who also stimulate wide public debate, she said, citing two of her colleagues, the political scientists Robert Putnam and Michael Sandel. ''Quirkiness can be a plus,'' Ms. Skocpol said.</p>
        <p>Most scholars make their academic careers by contributing to the gradual accumulation of new knowledge. But Ms. Skocpol said that the academy also needs ''agenda setters'' and ''question raisers,'' people like Daniel Patrick Moynihan.</p>
