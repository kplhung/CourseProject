        <p>Two awards shows came to New York City on successive nights this week, and they were as different as the pop moment and the soul heritage. The MTV Video Music Awards on Thursday night at Radio City Music Hall had giant production numbers, bared navels, lip-synching and hype. The Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer Awards on Wednesday at the Hammerstein Ballroom offered modesty, a good heart and great unassisted voices.</p>
        <p>Both are about music that never went away and that has, in fact, come back around. The vocal groups and soul belters who were recognized by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation, like Stevie Wonder, the Chi-Lites and Betty Wright, are direct musical ancestors of MTV award-winners like Sisqo, N'Sync and Christina Aguilera. Yet while they can still sing their hearts out, the seasoned rhythm-and-blues performers aren't as glamorous as their MTV heirs.</p>

        <p>Two awards shows came to New York City on successive nights this week, and they were as different as the pop moment and the soul heritage. The MTV Video Music Awards on Thursday night at Radio City Music Hall had giant production numbers, bared navels, lip-synching and hype. The Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer Awards on Wednesday at the Hammerstein Ballroom offered modesty, a good heart and great unassisted voices.</p>
        <p>Both are about music that never went away and that has, in fact, come back around. The vocal groups and soul belters who were recognized by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation, like Stevie Wonder, the Chi-Lites and Betty Wright, are direct musical ancestors of MTV award-winners like Sisqo, N'Sync and Christina Aguilera. Yet while they can still sing their hearts out, the seasoned rhythm-and-blues performers aren't as glamorous as their MTV heirs.</p>
        <p>The MTV awards are a binge of promotion through glitter and approved mild naughtiness. They're chosen from MTV's limited offerings by a voting panel that's half music-business professionals, half fans, and in essence they recognize the successful application of huge marketing budgets -- for grooming artists, making videos, advertising and promoting songs to radio stations -- to reach MTV's squealing, allowance-squandering young audience. The MTV awards are the happy face of good returns on a pop investment, and the show presents itself as one branch of conglomerated show business, tied in to movies, television and this year to professional wrestling: Kid Rock and the Rock stood side by side to give an award.</p>
        <p>Well-behaved pop professionals dominated the telecast, which was more about skin than sin. Sisqo and Nelly bared their chests for their hip-hop come-ons. And Britney Spears, determined to prove the line in her hit ''Oops . . . I Did It Again'' that insists ''I'm not that innocent,'' stripped down to a glittering skin-tight halter top and pants, ending her number with a showgirl's pelvic thrust.</p>
        <p>Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit risked losing any semblance of rock credibility by stepping onstage to rap with Christina Aguilera. And everyone's antisocial anathema, Eminem, performed ''The Real Slim Shady,'' which warns about how many people are ''just like me,'' with dozens of quasi-look-alikes. But the best provocation Eminem could muster in his acceptance speeches was to show pills falling out of his pockets and to thank critics of his albums for helping him sell more of them.</p>
        <p>MTV promised feuds it didn't deliver. The show had appearances by Shawn Fanning, who invented the music-sharing program Napster, and Lars Ulrich of Metallica, which has sued Napster. Mr. Fanning wore a Metallica T-shirt, but MTV gave Mr. Ulrich the advantage: a video skit that equated sharing with theft.</p>
        <p>It took Rage Against the Machine, a band that still believes in a political rock rebellion, to shake up the show. It performed alongside video screens showing montages of demonstrations and phrases like ''Are you getting what you paid for?'' and ''corporate greed.'' Later, as Limp Bizkit collected an award, Rage's bass player, Timothy Commerford, tried a little anarchy: climbing up a tower of television monitors onstage, making it sway and threatening to jump. (He was arrested for assaulting a police officer when he eventually came down.) It was a true disruption in a show that prefers any outrageousness to take place on cue.</p>
        <p>The MTV awards, shown live, have a nationwide reach; the Rhythm and Blues Foundation dreams of being on television someday, said its co-chairman, the singer Jerry Butler of the Impressions. The MTV awards puts a silvery man-on-the-moon statuette next to young hitmakers' gold and platinum albums, while the Pioneer Awards gives checks for $4,000 to $15,000 to aging musicians who may well use them for medical expenses or, as Sylvia Robinson (the voice of ''Love Is Strange'') announced she would, contribute it to buy a building for her church.</p>
        <p>Others who received awards included Huey (Piano) Smith, who wrote ''Rockin' Pneumonia'' and ''Sea Cruise'' and declared bankruptcy in the 1990's; Johnnie Johnson, who was Chuck Berry's pianist; and the songwriter and producer Clyde Otis. Mr. Wonder, receiving a lifetime achievement award, vowed to help make a benefit album for the foundation that would bring together younger and older rhythm-and-blues musicians.</p>
        <p>The Rhythm and Blues Foundation has been the music business's nagging conscience. It has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to musicians in need, and it has pushed recording companies to make up for past abuses by raising royalty rates on old, exploitative contracts. Berry Gordy, the founder and former owner of Motown Records (which is now part of Universal), announced he was joining on both fronts, contributing $750,000 to help musicians and saying that he, too, is now in favor of royalty reform, including revisions to the tough contracts Motown made in its 1960's golden age.</p>
        <p>For its first 10 years, the Rhythm and Blues Foundation made its awards precede or follow the Grammys, latching on to some of the current stars who show up for the event. This year Grammy time became prohibitively expensive, so the foundation slipped in next to the MTV Video Music Awards instead. Yet while there were well-known musicians in attendance -- Aretha Franklin, Bonnie Raitt, Herbie Hancock, Dionne Warwick, Sister Sledge, Brenda Russell -- the only representatives of the MTV generation were Brian McKnight, who sang a Marvin Gaye tribute, and Erykah Badu.</p>
        <p>Presenting an award to Betty Wright, who had the million-selling hit ''Clean Up Woman'' in 1971, Ms. Badu hinted that current stars had not eliminated the problems that face their elders. ''I didn't know what to expect,'' said Ms. Badu, whose 1997 debut album has sold three million copies. ''I thought it was going to be a lot more money.''</p>
        <p>The MTV awards had an appearance by Richard Hatch, the millionaire winner on ''Survivor.'' But Smokey Robinson, the M.C. on Wednesday night, called the Rhythm and Blues Foundation ''the real survivor awards.'' He went on to explain, ''They survived a tough business where the rats ate you.''</p>
