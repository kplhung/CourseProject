        <p>Editorial urges Sen Joseph I Lieberman, Democratic vice presidential candidate, to drop out of Senate race in Connecticut and leave contest to candidates who will definitely be available to serve</p>

        <p>Joseph Lieberman is now running for two national offices at the same time -- his Senate seat from his home state of Connecticut and the vice presidency as the Democratic Party nominee.

Moreover, his dual candidacy could lead to a situation in which Connecticut chooses a Democratic senator in November but has a Republican installed by appointment. It could also lead to legislative contortions as Democrats in the State Capitol try to figure out a way to prevent Gov. John Rowland, a Republican, from filling the vacancy from within his own party should Mr. Lieberman go to Washington as vice president. At this point, only a few days after the traditional Labor Day kickoff of the fall campaign, there is still time for Mr. Lieberman to get off the ballot and let the two parties conduct a fair fight for his vacated seat.</p>

        <p>Joseph Lieberman is now running for two national offices at the same time -- his Senate seat from his home state of Connecticut and the vice presidency as the Democratic Party nominee. The Connecticut Elections Enforcement Commission decided this week that this double campaigning is legal. That still does not make it fair to Connecticut voters or smart for the state's Democrats.</p>
        <p>By staying in both races, Mr. Lieberman is hedging his bets in a way that benefits him, of course. But it hardly sends a signal of confidence about the future of the ticket he is sharing with Vice President Al Gore. Moreover, his dual candidacy could lead to a situation in which Connecticut chooses a Democratic senator in November but has a Republican installed by appointment. It could also lead to legislative contortions as Democrats in the State Capitol try to figure out a way to prevent Gov. John Rowland, a Republican, from filling the vacancy from within his own party should Mr. Lieberman go to Washington as vice president. At this point, only a few days after the traditional Labor Day kickoff of the fall campaign, there is still time for Mr. Lieberman to get off the ballot and let the two parties conduct a fair fight for his vacated seat.</p>
        <p>As things now stand, if Mr. Lieberman resigns from the Senate race before Oct. 27, Connecticut's Democratic State Central Committee would pick a replacement. The name mentioned most often is the state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, who would be a strong contender for the job. The Republican nominee, Mayor Philip Giordano of Waterbury, is regarded by some as a place-holder against Mr. Lieberman, but the Republicans would have the option of asking him to step aside in favor of a  stronger replacement.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Lieberman wins both his Senate campaign and the vice presidency, Governor Rowland will pick a replacement who must run for the office two years later. Mr. Rowland can be expected to choose a member of his own party for the job, giving the Senate one more Republican vote. Despite this potential for damage to his own party, Mr. Lieberman has said that he favors a Rowland appointment now because it would give the political system enough time to work -- with full primaries and full-fledged elections in the year 2002. If he pulls out early, he has argued, the process would be chaotic and unfair since a party committee, instead of a primary, would pick the Democratic candidate. Mr. Lieberman's spokesman adds that the winner of such a hurried election this year would be serving for six years, a full Senate term. He points out that the governor's probable Republican appointee would serve for only two years at most until facing election. This reasoning is thin and self-serving.</p>
        <p>The situation is prompting Democratic leaders in Connecticut to contemplate a hasty re-rigging of election laws. The thought is that if Mr. Lieberman resigns from the Senate to be vice president, the Democratic legislature can then pass a bill requiring a special election in three or perhaps six months to fill the empty seat sometime next year. Mr. Rowland, according to this plan, would have difficulty vetoing such a bill because it would appear undemocratic to deprive voters of an election.</p>
        <p>But the cleaner, fairer solution is to let Connecticut voters have a choice in the regularly scheduled general election. Mr. Lieberman should resign from the Senate race right away and leave that contest to candidates who will definitely be available to serve. That action would also put a ring of confidence into his predictions of victory on the presidential ticket.</p>
