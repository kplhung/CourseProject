        <p>President Clinton urged China's president, Jiang Zemin, to open a dialogue with the new government of Taiwan and to put a stop to China's missile exports to Pakistan.

        <p>End to Austria Sanctions Urged  A panel appointed by the European Union to assess human rights and political life in Austria reported that minorities, refugees and immigrants enjoy as many or more rights and protections there as their counterparts elsewhere in the 15-member European Union. The findings clear the way for the European Union to lift diplomatic sanctions hurriedly imposed after a far-right party joined Austria's government.</p>

        <p>Bush Yields on Debates And Will Seek Compromise  Gov. George W. Bush abandoned his effort to impose his own schedule of presidential debates, and his campaign said it was prepared to sit down with aides to Vice President Al Gore to work out an agreement for debating under the auspices of a bipartisan commission.</p>

        <p>Mr. Bush held a sustained question-and-answer session with voters for the first time since the primary campaign. The Republican National Committee unveiled its harshest ad yet against Mr. Gore, in a drive to cast doubt on his credibility.</p>

The action is expected to lead to a vast increase in the number of electric cars on the road, not only in California but in New York, Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine, which have chosen to follow California pollution rules.</p>
