        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Movie Theaters Build Themselves Into a Corner'' (front page, Sept. 4):</p>
        <p>Dick Westerling, a spokesman for Regal Cinemas, predicts that declining attendance will cause theater owners to become ''more creative'' about ways to generate revenue. He means that they should have more previews, more souvenirs for sale and more ads on popcorn bags. How about being creative by insisting that the industry make better movies?</p>
        <p>This summer, my friends and I keep saying, ''We want to go to the movies, but there's nothing to see.'' People want to go the movies, but the on-screen product isn't appealing.</p>
        <p>There is a blockbuster-focused mentality pervading the industry that prevents intelligent, amusing, sophisticated films from being made. Perhaps if these kinds of movies were being produced, theater owners would find that the empty seats in all their sparsely populated theaters would fill.</p>
        <p>RUTH WOLFF  New York, Sept. 4, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a playwright and screenwriter.</p>
