        <p>Mike Hampton stalked off the Shea Stadium mound, his disappointment and rage growing with each steady stride. There was polite applause from the fans for Hampton's gritty effort, but Hampton did not hear it. He still heard the sound of Scott Rolen's bat connecting for a two-run homer that eventually guided the Phillies to a 2-0 victory last night over the Mets. It was a sick sound to Hampton.</p>
        <p>About 20 feet before Hampton reached the first-base dugout, he flung his glove forward as if it were another misplaced cut fastball. Then Hampton rumbled down the steps and shook a stack of towels, attacking them as if waiting for something to emerge.</p>
        <p>Hampton, a left-hander, turned around and used his right forearm to bump a bulky cooler and almost knock a cup out of Todd Pratt's hands. After Hampton was careless enough to potentially injure his forearm, he flung his cap ahead of him and bolted to the clubhouse. The game was over for Hampton in the eighth inning, and it ended for the Mets soon after that.</p>
        <p>''It's just September,'' Hampton said, ''and I hate to lose, period.''</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine locked the clubhouse door after the Mets lost for the sixth time in the last seven games and continued to make this September feel like the sluggish Septembers of the last two years.</p>
        <p>But Valentine would not talk about what he might have told his team. What could he say: get a hit? That might be a start, since the Mets were 0 for 7 with men in scoring position last night, stranding 11 runners.</p>
        <p>Valentine could also lecture the intense Hampton about not using a forearm as a battering device. Hampton, who sat in front of his locker with a black cap pulled over his eyes and whispered his answers, would not hear that, either.</p>
        <p>''I never regret it,'' Hampton said. ''That's me. I'm just going to be me. I'm not going to act some way to impress anybody.''</p>
        <p>Valentine said that the Mets ''don't need that kind of emotion'' after surrendering a homer. But the manager added that he was not perturbed by Hampton's display.</p>
        <p>''I like everything Mike Hampton does,'' Valentine said. ''I'd rather have him not jeopardize his health. He's hit enough water coolers to know how to hit them.''</p>
        <p>Hampton's histrionics were memorable, but the Mets' offense was most memorable for its absence. Bruce Chen and four relievers tamed the Mets on nine hits, causing some fans to boo a team that is 47-23 at home.</p>
        <p>The Phillies, who terrorized the Mets by sweeping a crucial three-game series last September, ended an eight-game losing streak. The Mets slipped to three and one-half games behind the Braves in the National League East and saw their bulge over the Diamondbacks in the wild-card race shrink to four and one-half games because Atlanta and Arizona both won.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was the eighth day of September, a month in which the Mets have unraveled in different and dramatic ways for the last two years. Their latest tumbling has not escalated to a perilous stage yet because they still control the wild card, but they were home and they wanted to stop this spell before it became worse. They wanted Hampton to boost them.</p>
        <p>This was the type of pivotal game perfectly suited for Hampton. The Mets acquired him from the Astros to help guide them into the postseason, and to get that far they will obviously need him on nights like this. While the Phillies might be one of the worst teams in baseball, this was a spot for Hampton to perform like an ace. And he did, until his cutter to Rolen in the eighth.</p>
        <p>''He made one bad pitch to a good hitter,'' catcher Mike Piazza said.</p>
        <p>Before Rolen's homer, Valentine let Hampton bat with Jay Payton on first and one out in the seventh. Valentine did not want Hampton to bunt, either, as Hampton went up swinging and slapped a single to center field. The hit put men on first and second and knocked Chen out of the game.</p>
        <p>But the Mets did not capitalize after Hampton's hit as Vicente Padilla retired Derek Bell and Edgardo Alfonzo on groundouts. Chen limited the Mets to eight hits in six and one-third innings to increase his scoreless streak to 20 2/3 innings. The Mets had at least one base runner in eight of nine innings but had only two runners reach third.</p>
        <p>Valentine claimed that the Mets had not played much differently during this streak than they had played all season because they were pitching ''pretty well,'' hitting ''O.K.'' and playing ''pretty good'' defense. Still, even if the Mets have played similarly, the results have been bad.</p>
        <p>''We hit some balls hard, but we didn't bunch them,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>The game moved to the eighth and Hampton issued a two-out walk to Doug Glanville, who had been 5 for 25 in his career against him. That forced Hampton to face Rolen, a dangerous hitter. The count drifted to 3-2 and Hampton fired a cutter that stayed down the middle.</p>
        <p>After Rolen clubbed it, Hampton dropped into a crouch and never looked up. He remained in the crouch for about 15 seconds, looking stoic. That changed when he walked the next batter, left the game and acted like a cranky toddler tossing his toys around his room. Today is Hampton's 28th birthday.</p>
        <p>''Giving up a homer,'' Hampton said. ''I made a mistake.''</p>
