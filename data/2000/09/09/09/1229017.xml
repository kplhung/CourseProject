        <p>STEVE JUDY was all of 28 years old, and less than a month into his job as mayor of Coeur d'Alene, when he had his first official brush with the Aryan Nations, a white supremacist group that he and countless other people in this northern Idaho city describe as an awful thorn in the side of the community. The group wanted a permit for a parade down the town's main street.</p>
        <p>''I'm 31 now, though some days I feel 70,'' Mr. Judy said. ''It's going to be a great book someday, I keep telling people. 'So You Want to Be a Mayor?' That's going to be the title.''</p>

        <p>STEVE JUDY was all of 28 years old, and less than a month into his job as mayor of Coeur d'Alene, when he had his first official brush with the Aryan Nations, a white supremacist group that he and countless other people in this northern Idaho city describe as an awful thorn in the side of the community. The group wanted a permit for a parade down the town's main street.</p>
        <p>''I'm 31 now, though some days I feel 70,'' Mr. Judy said. ''It's going to be a great book someday, I keep telling people. 'So You Want to Be a Mayor?' That's going to be the title.''</p>
        <p>If he ever does write a book, Mr. Judy says, then Sept. 7, 2000, will mark a jubilant chapter: the day a local jury delivered a $6.3 million verdict against the Aryan Nations, a damage award that lawyers for two victims of a 1998 attack by members of the  group hope will bankrupt the organization and drive it out of the area.</p>
        <p>Jurors made clear in interviews yesterday that the question in their 10 hours of deliberations was never really whether to punish Richard G. Butler, the self-styled pastor of the group, and his deputy, but rather by how much to punish them; for a while, some jurors held out for a judgment of as much as $100 million. In any event, the mayor said yesterday, the community sent a message with the award.</p>
        <p>''It's the message we've always tried to give out: This is a place that cares about human rights,'' he said. ''Maybe now we'll be known as the place that got the verdict against the Aryan Nations.''</p>
        <p>People in Coeur d'Alene seem palpably frustrated that northern Idaho has acquired a reputation as a haven for neo-Nazis and other extremists like the 82-year-old Mr. Butler, a retired aeronautics engineer who moved to his compound 20 miles north of here in the 1970's to escape what he once called the ''alien scum'' in Southern California. He has described the compound as the ''international headquarters of the white race.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Judy says he contends with the region's image wherever he goes. ''It's up there with the floating green'' -- a signature hole on a golf course in this resort town -- ''and the beauty of the place as a whole,'' he said. ''Tons of people know how beautiful Coeur d'Alene is. But you also hear, 'Oh, is that where those skinheads or the Aryans are from?' ''</p>
        <p>What is less reported by the national media, he says, is the community's response to the fringe groups. First of all, there is the revulsion that most people feel for them. There is also the human-rights education fund set up with local donations, establishing a curriculum to teach schoolchildren, the mayor said, about ''dignity, tolerance and respect.'' There are also the various honors given the town, including the Raoul Wallenberg Award, usually given to an individual but presented to the entire community in 1987 for its efforts to counteract the Aryan Nations' message.</p>
        <p>Although some 80 skinheads and other young men gathered here in July 1998 for a march sponsored by the group, Mr. Judy feels some frustration that the community's response, a quaintly named ''Lemons to Lemonade'' campaign, was less well reported. Thousands of people attended a counter-rally, and some devised a pledge program for human rights that raised more than $1,000 a minute for every one of the 32 minutes the extremists marched.</p>
        <p>MR. JUDY, citing the loss of merchant business and the added security costs created by such hubbub and tension,  says the Aryan Nations has committed ''economic terrorism'' against his city. (Police security for the 1998 march, which ended without violence, cost more than $100,000.)</p>
        <p>''I'm a big believer in the Constitution,'' the mayor said, sitting in his office at City Hall, which has a magnificent view of Lake Coeur d'Alene. ''I studied constitutional law'' at Gonzaga University, and ''the community's rights are really second place to any organization's right to free speech.'' But ''it just seems to fly in the face of this Republic we have that those folks can come and portray a message here that hurts people, that hurts our community, that hurts a lot of people economically. What are the community's rights in this? It just doesn't seem fair.''</p>
        <p>As for the reputation that extremists have bestowed on the area, Mr. Judy said: ''We can't compete with the free media that they receive that's negative. We all want the headline to read, 'Coeur d'Alene, the city known for human rights, has this problem,' and the problem's two column inches and the rest of it is all about Coeur d'Alene and how great it is and how we respond. That's what we want. We deserve it.''</p>
        <p>But whether the jury's award will help change perceptions is an open question. A leader of the Jewish Defense League from Los Angeles recently criticized Coeur d'Alene for what he called its ''placid'' response to the Aryan Nations over the years. And even if the group's members leave, northern Idaho will remain one of the least ethnically diverse places in the nation: the black population is 0.2 percent, according to census figures, and the Hispanic population about 2.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Judy is up for re-election next year but says he has not yet decided whether to run. He certainly seems politically inclined -- he worked for five years as a Senate aide in Washington -- but he has a family with three young boys to support. At $1,000 a month, his salary is far from lavish, and he and his wife are hoping to establish a business soon.</p>
        <p>Still, he said, Coeur d'Alene sent a powerful message with the verdict on Thursday, and he is proud to be a public official here.</p>
        <p>''I think we've struggled against hate and against the Aryans for so long here,'' he said, ''a victory like this is a big deal to all of us.''</p>
