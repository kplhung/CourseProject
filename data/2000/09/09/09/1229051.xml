        <p>As she strode about the tables at the Sunnyside Senior Center in Queens on a recent morning, Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan was greeted by the crowd, mostly women, as though she were their favorite daughter. They asked about her 2-year-old son, they admired her necklace and they cheered lustily as she asked for their continued support.</p>
        <p>But when Ms. Nolan was asked by one smiling woman how she was doing, the assemblywoman's own smile vanished briefly. ''To tell you the truth,'' she answered, ''I'm a little bit nervous.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Nolan, the eight-term incumbent assemblywoman, the chairwoman of the Assembly's Committee on Labor, and a veteran Queens politician, is facing a political challenge in Tuesday's primary in the 37th Assembly District.</p>
        <p>Her opponent is Patrick T. O'Malley, 33, a former Queens prosecutor who placed his private law practice aside to undertake his first foray into elective politics. But Mr. O'Malley is no ordinary political neophyte. He is the brother of Martin O'Malley, the mayor of Baltimore, and he has raised a sufficient amount of money to cause Queens Democratic leaders, Ms. Nolan foremost among them, to take his candidacy seriously.</p>
        <p>Apart from the $70,000 he has raised, Mr. O'Malley was endorsed this week in a joint appearance by a past mayor of New York City, Edward I. Koch, and the current mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Ms. Nolan has long had a tenuous relationship with the Democratic Party organization in Queens, which took the unusual step of declining to endorse the incumbent in this Assembly race.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nolan, 42, has had little in the way of well-financed, competitive races since she was elected to the Assembly in 1984. ''I have to take this race very seriously,'' she said. ''I have to stress my record with regard to education, and programs that have really helped people in this community.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Malley, in discussing the race, said he decided to run because of what he described as the lackluster job Ms. Nolan had done in representing the district. His major complaint was that Ms. Nolan is so out of touch with her constituents that she voted in favor of repealing New York City's commuter tax for state residents who work in the city -- a position that has also made her the target of attacks by the mayor. The tax was abolished for in-state residents effective last July and for out-of-state commuters earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Malley said that this deprives the city of the tax revenue from commuters who work in New York City. ''That is a move that has robbed the city of $500 million each year,'' Mr. O'Malley said. ''That's not the vote of someone who cared about this city and this community.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Nolan explained her vote on the commuter tax as being based on her view of the regional nature of the New York area economy. She further said that by voting to reduce taxes for suburban residents, legislators from New York City could call upon their suburban colleagues for cooperation. ''I don't think the repeal of the commuter tax will have long-term negative consequences,'' Ms. Nolan said. ''We have to look at ourselves as being in a regional economy.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Nolan was quick to point out other aspects of her record. A vocal abortion rights advocate, Ms. Nolan mentioned, for example, how she secured financing for several programs, including the first occupational safety and health clinic in Queens, and how she sponsored legislation to increase the minimum wage.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nolan described her opponent as someone ''who seems perfectly nice,'' but as a political newcomer who was prompted to run in part by the invitation of the Queens Democratic organization. Last year, Ms. Nolan incurred the wrath of the Queens Democratic Party chairman, former Representative Thomas Manton.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Manton resigned from Congress and engineered the selection of his hand-picked successor on the ballot, Ms. Nolan was harshly critical. She broke with other Queens Democratic leaders by refusing to endorse Mr. Manton's successor, Representative Joseph Crowley. Instead, she endorsed City Councilman Walter McCaffrey, who undertook a short-lived challenge to Mr. Crowley earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Malley, a member of the Anarac Democratic Club -- of which Mr. Manton is the most prominent member -- insisted that the former congressman had offered no assistance or encouragement to his campaign. ''My campaign is not dependent on anyone's support,'' he said. Mr. Manton echoed that view, saying that he had not endorsed either candidate and that he had offered no assistance to Mr. O'Malley's insurgent race.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. O'Malley has put together a team of volunteers and a busy, if crowded campaign headquarters on the second floor of a building on Queens Boulevard. His campaign literature notes his work as a volunteer in teaching English in a village in Peru and his former job as a fifth-grade teacher in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>On the issues, Mr. O'Malley discussed the need to obtain more state money for schools in the district. He said he favors ''new educational techniques,'' including vouchers. On abortion rights, Mr. O'Malley said he generally opposes abortion, particularly the late-term procedure that its critics call ''partial birth abortion.''</p>
        <p>The 37th Assembly District is a stretch of western Queens, including Sunnyside, Ridgewood and parts of Woodside and Long Island City. It is a mainly working-class area that still has a large Irish-American population. But the district has in recent years had a growing population of Korean and Hispanic residents.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nolan has raised about $150,000 for the race and has years of incumbency and a network of Democratic supporters and field soldiers at her disposal. Nonetheless, she said she is taking nothing for granted.</p>
        <p>''I'm having to get out there and work,'' she said, before leaving the Sunnyside center for another campaign event. ''But having a race like this makes you spend time getting your message out. And, actually, that's a good thing.''</p>
