        <p>Whenever Aaron Copland spoke of his one true opera, ''The Tender Land,'' given its premiere in New York in 1954, he sounded rather defensive. He used to say that for composers like himself not hopelessly drawn to ''la forme fatale,'' as he dubbed the genre, writing an opera was a very problematic business.</p>
        <p>''The Tender Land,'' a simple story of a struggling Midwest farm family in the 1930's, ''is not the kind of work to be pulled apart for study of its counterpoint and harmony,'' Copland wrote in his autobiography. The music, he said, is very plain, with a colloquial flavor, mostly diatonic and orchestrated simply.</p>

        <p>Whenever Aaron Copland spoke of his one true opera, ''The Tender Land,'' given its premiere in New York in 1954, he sounded rather defensive. He used to say that for composers like himself not hopelessly drawn to ''la forme fatale,'' as he dubbed the genre, writing an opera was a very problematic business.</p>
        <p>''The Tender Land,'' a simple story of a struggling Midwest farm family in the 1930's, ''is not the kind of work to be pulled apart for study of its counterpoint and harmony,'' Copland wrote in his autobiography. The music, he said, is very plain, with a colloquial flavor, mostly diatonic and orchestrated simply.</p>
        <p>Copland sold his work short. On Thursday night the Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College opened its season with a concert performance of ''The Tender Land,'' presented without intermission in one 90-minute span. Cal Stewart Kellogg conducted an admirable cast and some players from the Orchestra of St. Luke's.</p>
        <p>An intimate staged production is still the ideal way to experience the opera. But in this concert performance, with the orchestra playing from the stage instead of a pit, the intricacies of Copland's score seemed newly revealed. Though seldom complex, the music's wide open diatonic harmonies and its gently lyrical vocal writing movingly befit this archetypal American story, with a libretto by Horace Everett (a pseudonym for the dancer and painter Erik Johns).</p>
        <p>Laurie Moss, a winsome woman on the eve of her high school graduation, lives on a farm with her widowed mother, her 10-year-old sister and her stern grandfather. Two young drifters come by looking for work. One of them, the hardy, shiftless Top, sets his sights on Laurie right off; but she falls for the younger man, the soft-spoken, shy Martin.</p>
        <p>The characters sometimes skirt  stereotypes, especially Grandpa Moss, who denounces Laurie at her graduation party for allowing Martin to sneak a simple kiss. Yet the grandfather knows all too well that Laurie dreams of escape and adventure, and that her mother, filled with her own stifled fantasies, will not fight to keep her at home.</p>
        <p>Copland did a better job of projecting the complexities of the characters through his music than he may have realized. Even in the opening pages of the score, which evoke the wistful tranquillity and cyclical routines of prairie life through shimmering, sustained modal orchestral chords, the music is quietly restless. The tremulous orchestral chords are voiced with gaping intervals, and wind instruments and strings in harmonics spike the chords with subtle dissonance.</p>
        <p>The love scene between Laurie and Martin is particularly effective. Below the arching vocal lines, the orchestra teems with activity, capturing the cross-purposes of the young people: Martin sees in Laurie a chance to settle down; she sees in him a means of escape.</p>
        <p>Though hearing the orchestra play from the same stage as the singers was revealing, it created some balance problems. Mr. Kellogg conducted a vivid, though not faultless, performance. But he might have tried to keep the orchestra's sound more in control.</p>
        <p>The soprano Tammy Tyburczy brought a sweet lyric voice to the role of Laurie, and Julia Fischer's dusky mezzo-soprano was right for Ma Moss. Yet neither singer's diction was clear enough. Just when you were ready to blame Copland, whose skills at prosody were not the best, the tenor Benjamin Brecher as Martin and the baritone James Demler as Top took the stage, and you heard their every word.</p>
        <p>This just shows what singers can do if they are as concerned with projecting English as with making pretty sounds. Gary Giardina was the crusty Grandpa Moss. Tory Giardina took the mostly spoken role of Beth.</p>
