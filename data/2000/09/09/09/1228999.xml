        <p>Three days of brainstorming by the leaders of virtually all the world's nations ended tonight with a brave attempt to agree on a set of goals for the next millennium, and common values by which to govern.</p>
        <p>It was not easy, but more than 150 leaders and few stand-ins tried to mesh the demands for universal democracy, the rule of law and human rights, including the equality of women -- all important to the developed world -- with demands by poor nations for better balance in the world's economy and more benefits from the rise of globalization.</p>

        <p>Three days of brainstorming by the leaders of virtually all the world's nations ended tonight with a brave attempt to agree on a set of goals for the next millennium, and common values by which to govern.</p>
        <p>It was not easy, but more than 150 leaders and few stand-ins tried to mesh the demands for universal democracy, the rule of law and human rights, including the equality of women -- all important to the developed world -- with demands by poor nations for better balance in the world's economy and more benefits from the rise of globalization.</p>
        <p>''We will spare no effort to make the United Nations a more effective instrument for pursuing all of these priorities,'' a declaration issued today said. ''The fight for development for all the peoples of the world; the fight against ignorance, poverty and disease; the fight against injustice; the fight against violence, terror and crime; and the fight against the degradation and destruction of our common home.''</p>
        <p>Few would expect the eight pages of ambitious pledges to be fulfilled, any more than citizens of any one country would believe the same promises from politicians. But the endorsement could not come from any higher authorities.</p>
        <p>''This has been the mother of all summits,'' Kishore Mahbubani, Singapore's representative at the United Nations, said. ''It also confirmed that the U.N. provides the only viable setting to develop a village council for a global village.''</p>
        <p>Stripped of the ceremony usually associated with events like this, the largest gathering of leaders ever held had in the end turned into an impromptu forum for examining the performance of the United Nations.</p>
        <p>There were many who felt that the organization could be doing more to help the poor and keep the peace.</p>
        <p>The final round of speeches was its own corrective, illustrating the passions that still run high on both sides of the divide between the north and south, the rich and poor. President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe was the most blunt.</p>
        <p>''If the new millennium, like the last,'' Mr. Mugabe said, ''remains an age of hegemonic empires and conquerors doing the same old things in new technological ways, remains the age of the master race, the master economy and the master state, then I am afraid we in developing countries will have to stand up as a matter of principle and say, 'Not again.' ''</p>
        <p>President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, taking a more optimistic line, said he thought that a lot of listening was going on and that the sheer number of government leaders gave the meeting ''the sort of weight that it needs.''</p>
        <p>''Because of that kind of participation,'' Mr. Mbeki said in an interview, ''it becomes possible to say what are the matters around which there is consensus in the world.'' He sees agreement that all nations have to deal with the challenge of world poverty and an understanding ''that in fact the resources and the means are there within the world economy to deal with this matter.''</p>
        <p>''I think that's a very important conclusion, because it gives the possibility to say what is the next step we then take,'' he added.</p>
        <p>That step, he said, is to reform the major international institutions like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>''Some people might say this is cynical,'' Mr. Mbeki said. ''But if you look at the almost 60 Chinese whose bodies are found in the port of Dover in England, they traveled all the way from China, pushed out of China by poverty. So you can't sit in the United Kingdom and say we're insulated from poverty in China because it's far away. When those bodies land at the doorstep, then you know that you actually are not insulated from that poverty.''</p>
        <p>In a week of meetings that brought together not only political leaders, but also corporate executives, religious figures and all varieties of protestors, many more events were outside the General Assembly hall than in it. At roundtables, government leaders exchanged ideas more informally than in set speeches.</p>
        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan met dozens of leaders privately to discuss situations confronting the United Nations around the world. At least 185 meetings between government leaders took place at United Nations headquarters, to add to the dozens of others held in hotels and diplomatic missions around New York.</p>
        <p>About 85 nations signed or ratified a total of nearly 300 treaties and conventions. The most attention was given to two conventions, one that bars children younger than 18 from participation in armed conflict and the other a prohibition on the sale or use of children, particularly for sex or pornography.</p>
        <p>A memorial to child soldiers killed, wounded, missing or taken prisoner of war on several continents was announced at Unicef, the United Nations children's fund. An aluminum slab inscribed with the names of scores of children, the memorial will travel around the United States to spread awareness of the more than 300,000 children thought to be fighting in wars in 30 countries. Many are forcibly conscripted or abducted by rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka and several groups in Colombia.</p>
        <p>Inside the iron fence that separated the people riding in limousines from the ones who were swamped by the traffic jams that the motorcades left in their wakes, the United Nations headquarters groaned a little, too. A 50's-era building with vintage elevators and escalators designed for 51 member nations whose leaders did not travel with small armies, the complex is under increasing strain, now with 189 member nations. It was 188 until this week, when the flag of Tuvalu (population 10,000) was raised.</p>
        <p>New York will have a chance on Sunday to bask in some gratitude for shouldering the inconvenience and expense of security, blocked intersections, intrusive motorcades and booked-up restaurants caused by all of the high-level caucusing. Windows on both sides of the Secretariat Building, the glass box on the East River, will be lighted to spell out, ''Thank you, N.Y.'' Mr. Annan, who must not have left the building very often, thanked New Yorkers today for their ''courtesy, understanding and support.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the meeting, Therese Gasteau, said today that 8,000 delegates and 5,500 journalists swelled the ranks of 4,500 Secretariat employees who run the United Nations. The final tally of leaders included 100 presidents or other heads of state, including the president of Switzerland, which is not a United Nations member; 47 other government leaders; 3 crown princes; and a few vice presidents, deputy prime ministers and some ''high ranking officials,'' a category that included Yasir Arafat.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials, especially the protocol and security staffs, have abundant experience handling plumed personalities and ruffled feathers, so there were no major diplomatic incidents that anyone could think of today. There was only that glitch in the group picture, which showed a few more faces than expected. Most of them were quickly identified as invited extras. But one, at first known officially as ''the interloper,'' was not. Fred Eckhard, Mr. Annan's spokesman, spoke today of a diplomatic decision not to put a name to the face, but the man in the upper left corner was Count Carlo Marullo di Condojanni, of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which is not a member of the United Nations..</p>
        <p>Outside a church in Harlem on Thursday night, Mr. Mugabe was served with papers from a suit in federal District Court in Manhattan that complains of widespread abuse of power before parliamentary elections this year in Zimbabwe. The lead plaintiff, Adella Chiminya Tachiona, says in the suit that her husband, Tapfuma, was killed on April 15 by members of Mr. Mugabe's governing party under his direction, according to Theodore M. Cooperstein, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.</p>
        <p>While leaders dined in hotel suites, ballrooms and banquet rooms, many others, from United Nations officials to New York City police officers, headed for the United Nations cafeteria.</p>
        <p>The run on the cafeteria meant long days for Michael Friend, who manages most of the building's eating and drinking places. He and his cooks had to show up by 4 a.m. to fire up the breakfast grills, squeeze the oranges and prepare for the daily attack on the espresso corner.</p>
        <p>At the sandwich counter, Elaine Rivas and Nicky Glasgow said they were making 500 sandwiches a day instead of the usual 200. The summit meeting ate its way through 3,000 pounds of chicken, 2,000 pounds of beef, 300 pounds of pasta and 100 gallons of tomato sauce.</p>
        <p>Mr. Friend took a philosophical approach. ''I think of those people in their offices moving a pile of papers from one box to another,'' he said of the work going on upstairs. ''What do they have to show for it? Here people are happy. People are fed.''</p>
