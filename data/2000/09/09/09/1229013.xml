        <p>The city's new police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, plans to move at least 300 officers from quality-of-life enforcement to street patrols as part of a larger reassignment that will also beef up the city's overburdened detective squads, police officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik laid out his plans for the redeployment of about 500 officers during a meeting of senior patrol commanders on Thursday, the officials said. The meeting came two days after he announced that he was removing some of the department's top leaders. At the meeting, Mr. Kerik told the city's eight patrol borough commanders that he wanted more officers and detectives in the streets, and that he wanted to let rank-and-file officers know that hard work would lead to promotion, the officials said.</p>
        <p>To get more officers on the streets, Mr. Kerik told the commanders, he will move 300 to 450 officers out of the so-called tracer units, which saturate neighborhoods after intensive undercover drug initiatives and focus on quality-of-life violations, like public drinking and urination and vandalism. The purpose of these units, which include 900 officers, is to stabilize troubled neighborhoods and maintain the gains won through narcotics crackdowns.</p>
        <p>The tracer unit officers selected to return to patrol will be selected from those who have made the least arrests and shown the least initiative, one senior official said.</p>
        <p>The official said that Mr. Kerik's plans, which have been approved by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, should not be seen as a change in the mayor's focus on quality-of-life crimes and street disorder because Mr. Kerik is convinced the police can achieve the same results with fewer officers.</p>
        <p>In addition to moving more officers into the patrol and detective ranks, a primary goal of the redeployments is to tackle the dismal morale that has been plaguing the department, the official said. The new commissioner feels it is important to re-establish a career path through which officers who excel can win promotion, officials familiar with Mr. Kerik's thinking said.</p>
        <p>Toward that end, he has asked the commanders to select the highest achiever in each of the 76 precincts and in Housing and Transit Bureau commands to work in detective squads, which have long been understaffed. Once in the squads, the officers will be on the traditional 18-month track to promotion to a detective's position.</p>
        <p>At the same time, 70 detectives from narcotics and 10 from the 218-member Street Crime Unit will also be assigned to precinct detective commands. The combination of reassigning one officer from each precinct, and the transfer of the narcotics and street crime detectives, will increase the staffing in every detective squad in the city by two investigators, the official said.</p>
        <p>Thomas J. Scotto, the president of the detectives union, the Detectives Endowment Association, praised the move, saying that he has long sought an increase in the number of investigators assigned to precinct squads. He said that for nearly a year, citywide, the squads had been short 400 detectives. ''We're glad to see they're finally addressing this issue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Of the 7,300 detectives in the department, only about 1,100 are assigned to the precinct units, which investigate serious crimes, including murder and robbery.</p>
        <p>In addition to raising the morale of energetic and productive officers,  the moves are also meant to stir up the officers who do little -- and let them know life will be uncomfortable if they fail to contribute more.</p>
        <p>In the past, tracer units, like the Department's Street Crime Unit, have been criticized for conducting random and unjustified searches. Four plainclothes officers from the Street Crime Unit shot and killed Amadou Diallo in the Bronx, leading to changes that included returning some of the officers to uniform and restructuring the citywide unit so that officers in each borough report to commanders there.</p>
        <p>The police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, has also criticized the tracer units, complaining that the department assigned too many patrol officers to the teams.</p>
