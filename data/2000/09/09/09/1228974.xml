        <p>Randolph Pace, a brokerage firm executive charged with enriching himself through a wide-ranging securities fraud conducted between 1994 and 1997, pleaded guilty yesterday in Manhattan federal court to 13 felony counts of conspiracy, money laundering and securities fraud.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pace, who was indicted by a federal grand jury in November 1998, was co-founder of Rooney Pace Inc., a brokerage firm expelled from the industry in 1987 by the National Association of Securities Dealers. Mr. Pace, 54, was twice censured by regulators and was ultimately barred from the industry.</p>
        <p>Having been forced out of the brokerage business, Mr. Pace began to act as a consultant to small, obscure start-up companies hoping to raise capital in initial public offerings of stock. In his guilty plea before District Judge Loretta Preska yesterday, Mr. Pace said that he had made $2.86 million in illicit profits in the three-year scheme.</p>
        <p>During this time, Mr. Pace secretly controlled Sterling Foster, a firm that bilked investors out of $100 million before it closed its doors in 1997. Two other brokerage firms were involved in the scheme: VTR Capital and Investors Associates. Both are defunct.</p>
        <p>Describing his scheme to the judge, Mr. Pace said that as small companies in need of capital came to him for help, he developed a ''deal structure'' that would encourage others to participate. That structure involved issuing substantial amounts of stock to company founders and consultants, like Mr. Pace, at very low prices before the public offerings. Mr. Pace said he offered these deals to friends and colleagues as well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pace described how these insiders arranged to sell their shares upon the company's public offering  even though the company's financial filings stated that the shares were subject to lock-up agreements restricting their sale. ''I understood that this made the documents false and misleading,'' Mr. Pace said.</p>
        <p>The former executive also admitted that he tried to hide his involvement in certain deals by arranging for other individuals to get cheap stock in companies before their offerings on his behalf. He would then split the profits with these individuals. ''Regulators became uncomfortable with my presence in some of the deals,'' Mr. Pace explained.</p>
        <p>The 11 companies in which Mr. Pace and others made illicit profits are Lasergate Systems Inc., Advanced Voice Technologies Inc., Com/Tech Communication Technologies Inc., the Embryo Development Corporation, Applewoods Inc., ML Direct Inc., Interiors Inc., Compare Generiks Inc., Perry's Majestic Beer Inc., Decor Group Inc. and Superior Supplements Inc. None of the companies have been charged with wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>Also pleading guilty yesterday to nine felony counts was Warren Schreiber, a broker at VTR Capital who participated in the scheme. Mr. Schreiber agreed to forfeit a property he owns in Westhampton, N.Y., to pay restitution to investors who lost money.</p>
        <p>In his statement to the court, Mr. Pace tried to distance himself from the fraudulent sales practices conducted by Sterling Foster, VTR Capital and Investors Associates, the firms which brought the companies public. He did not apologize for his conduct.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of his plea, Mr. Pace agreed to give $3 million immediately to the United States government. He is subject to additional fines, to be determined by the court, that will go into a restitution fund for investors who lost $200 million or more as a result of the conspiracy, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pace is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 21. The maximum sentence for the crimes he pleaded guilty to is 135 years but under sentencing guidelines he will probably receive a sentence of seven to nine years.</p>
