        <p>The principal of a Catholic elementary school in the Bronx was arrested today on charges that he distributed child pornography over the Internet, becoming the latest man snared by a long-running investigation by Westchester officials into Internet pedophilia.</p>

        <p>The principal of a Catholic elementary school in the Bronx was arrested today on charges that he distributed child pornography over the Internet, becoming the latest man snared by a long-running investigation by Westchester officials into Internet pedophilia.</p>
        <p>The principal, James Irwin, 51, was arrested this morning outside his home in Yonkers, then charged with seven felony counts of promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child, said Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester district attorney. At his arraignment in Yonkers City Court, he pleaded not guilty to the charges, which each carry a maximum of seven years in prison, and was ordered held in $10,000 bail in the Westchester County Jail.</p>
        <p>For the last 15 years, Mr. Irwin has been principal of Our Lady of Mount Carmel School in the Belmont section; before that, he was a teacher at Holy Cross School in the Bronx for 13 years, Mrs. Pirro said. And throughout his tenure, Mr. Irwin, well regarded and well liked, had never been the subject of a complaint, said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.</p>
        <p>''We were very surprised to learn that he had been arrested this morning,'' Mr. Zwilling said, adding that Mr. Irwin had not yet been fired or suspended. ''We'll be doing what we can to see if there were anything in the past that we might not have heard about that might now come to light in light of this allegation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Irwin is not the only prominent citizen who has been arrested as part of Westchester's two-year-old investigation. Other defendants have included a Yonkers city official, a former member of the Somers school board, a former chairman of the New Castle Planning Board and a retired spokesman for PepsiCo Inc.</p>
        <p>Of 35 men charged before today, 28 have been convicted and cases against the other seven are pending. And while the arrests have been well publicized in Westchester, Mrs. Pirro said it was still chillingly easy for pedophiles to use the Internet to transmit child pornography or arrange sexual trysts with children.</p>
        <p>''There was a time when pedophiles were in amusement parks or in playgrounds looking for children,'' Mrs. Pirro said during a news conference here. ''They don't have to leave their home computer to do that today.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the defendants in some of the other cases, Mr. Irwin has not been accused of sexually abusing children he met online. In fact, the explicit photographs cited by investigators apparently did not involve children from his school, which runs from prekindergarten to eighth grade, Mrs. Pirro said.</p>
        <p>Instead, he used a laptop computer at home and, with his America Online account, began exchanging e-mail with an undercover investigator posing as another man interested in trading pictures of children performing sexually explicit acts, Mrs. Pirro said.</p>
        <p>The correspondence began on Aug. 2, Mrs. Pirro said, and ended on Sept. 1, when Mr. Irwin transmitted seven still photographs of children performing oral sex and other acts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Irwin ''wanted more material, and he had material,'' said Mrs. Pirro, who displayed Mr. Irwin's Gateway Solo laptop during the news conference.</p>
        <p>At the school today, only a half-day of classes had been scheduled, and the 290 students had already been dismissed before their parents could be notified, Mr. Zwilling said. The school, which has long been a pillar in its heavily Hispanic, working-class neighborhood, plans to send a letter about Mr. Irwin to parents on Monday.</p>
        <p>''He will not at this point or at any point in the foreseeable future be going back to Mount Carmel or any other Catholic school,'' Mr. Zwilling said.</p>
        <p>By early this evening, Mr. Irwin, who apparently did not have a criminal record, had not posted bail. Calls placed to Mr. Irwin's Cox Avenue home were not returned, but neighbors said Mr. Irwin was a friendly, single man who kept to himself in a neighborhood full of children.</p>
        <p>''I'm horrified,'' said Carmela Spano, a neighbor. ''He seemed like an educated and refined gentleman. And then to hear about that from a principal, someone you'd expect to be a law-abiding person? It's a shame.''</p>
