        <p>How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to share the stump with a thankless Congressional candidate, Dick Cheney learned today.</p>
        <p>After coming here to campaign at the request of Mark Nielsen, a Republican who is running for the House, Mr. Cheney, the party's vice-presidential candidate, found that Mr. Nielsen had also chosen today to release a new commercial that holds up three men as examples of honesty and integrity: former President George Bush, Senator John McCain of Arizona and Connecticut's own Senator Joseph I. Lieberman -- Mr. Cheney's Democratic rival.</p>
        <p>The commercial even appropriates one of Mr. Cheney's stock phrases, which he repeats at nearly every event, about how he and his running mate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, will ''restore honor and integrity to the White House.'' In the commercial, as the announcer intones, ''Today, when America wants leaders of honesty and integrity . . .'', the image on the screen is of President Bush, Mr. McCain and Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>''The timing was perhaps unfortunate,'' Mr. Nielsen allowed, explaining that his campaign chose to highlight Mr. Lieberman in its commercial because of the senator's popularity in his home state. ''Joseph Lieberman is from Connecticut. He is the local person whose reputation everyone from Connecticut understands.''</p>
        <p>Asked about the reference to Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Cheney said: ''He can mention anybody he wants. He ought to run his own campaign so he wins in Connecticut.''</p>
        <p>It was that kind of day for Mr. Cheney. It began with him on the defensive for not voting in 14 of the 16 state and local elections held since he moved to Dallas 4 1/2 years ago. He did not even vote in the Texas presidential primary on March 14 that selected his running mate.</p>
        <p>The Dallas Morning News reported on Mr. Cheney's skipped votes today, noting that he missed presidential and state primaries, runoffs, municipal and school board elections, and votes on constitutional amendments and a school bond issue. An aide to Mr. Cheney explained that he was out of town for this year's presidential primary and noted that Mr. Bush's main challenger, Mr. McCain, had already dropped out of the race by then.</p>
        <p>But the report proved something of an embarrassment to Mr. Cheney, who has spent much of the last three weeks traveling the country and stressing the importance of local involvement and control of schools. Asked by reporters what his record said about the importance of school elections, he said: ''I'm sure they are for people that are connected with them. But I also traveled a great deal. Dallas was my base, that's where I lived and was headquartered. But I was not involved in community affairs very extensively in Dallas. My focus was on global concerns.''</p>
        <p>After he was tapped as Mr. Bush's running mate, Mr. Cheney switched his voter registration back to his longtime home state of Wyoming, because of the provision in the Constitution that is often interpreted as forbidding electors from voting for a presidential and vice-presidential candidate from the same state. Mr. Cheney voted in a primary election in Jackson, Wyo., last month, after the Republican convention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's voting record was seized on by the campaign of Vice President Al Gore. ''Cheney's poor voting record is just the latest find that Bush's examination of his background, including his big oil ties, was not too thorough,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign. Mr. Cheney had been in charge of helping the Bush campaign screen potential running mates before he agreed to take on the job himself.</p>
        <p>That prompted a response from Mr. Cheney's communications director, Dirk Vande Beek. ''Secretary Cheney has voted in every general federal election for over 20 years,'' he said. ''He is a patriot and an avid participant in the political process. For the Gore campaign to try to make an issue of this is just one more example of their willingness to stoop to the politics of personal destruction and their reluctance to engage on the issues that really matter to the American people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, who visited a center for the elderly here to deliver a speech on Medicare reform, did not so much as acknowledge Mr. Nielsen's presence during the event, making no mention of him in his remarks and not shaking his hand.</p>
        <p>Asked about Mr. Cheney's failure to mention him at all during today's visit, Mr. Nielsen put on a brave face. ''I don't think there's anything to be read into it,'' he insisted.</p>
