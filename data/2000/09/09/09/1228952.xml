        <p>Under withering criticism from doctors, patients and Gov. George W. Bush, the Clinton administration backed away today from a plan to cut Medicare payments for cancer drugs given to hundreds of thousands of patients in clinics and doctors' offices each year.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the cuts, which were to take effect on Oct. 1, had been deferred indefinitely. Federal officials said they needed to study the whole process by which Medicare pays for outpatient cancer chemotherapy, including not only drugs but also the services of doctors and nurses.</p>
        <p>Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, who supervises Medicare as administrator of the federal Health Care Financing Administration, said she still believed that Medicare paid too much for cancer drugs. But, she said, the government will not make any immediate cuts in payments for the drugs because officials now recognize that payments to doctors for chemotherapy services are inadequate. In effect, doctors use the overpayments for the drugs to subsidize the cost of delivering them.</p>
        <p>Medicare officials said they would not lower payment for cancer drugs until they increased payments for administering them. Next year, Ms. DeParle said, the government will propose regulations or legislation to increase payments for the services.</p>
        <p>Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, told Congress in May that she intended to reduce ''excessive Medicare payments'' for drugs. Medicare officials said today that they did not realize then that the cuts could disrupt the entire system of cancer care. Doctors, led by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said they would have to send many cancer patients to hospitals for treatment, causing inconvenience to patients while increasing costs to Medicare.</p>
        <p>Medicare now pays for a very limited number of outpatient drugs, including cancer drugs. Administration officials say they worried that the cuts in cancer-drug payments would create a political fiasco, undermining Democratic efforts to enact Medicare coverage of all medically necessary prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Governor Bush, the Republican nominee for president, cited the planned cuts to support his argument that the Medicare agency was ''rigid and sluggish and slow to change'' and posed ''a hazard to your health.''</p>
        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, New York Republicans' nominee for the Senate, said last month, ''In light of its oft-proclaimed intention of saving Medicare, it's highly ironic that the Clinton administration would propose a policy that would sabotage the ability of seniors to obtain cancer therapy.''</p>
        <p>Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York, said recently that if the cuts were imposed, many doctors would find it ''financially impossible to provide chemotherapy services in their offices.''</p>
        <p>At least 121 members of Congress -- 70 Republicans and 51 Democrats -- signed letters to Dr. Shalala expressing alarm at the planned cuts, which would have ranged from 30 percent to 50 percent, depending on the specific drug, and would have saved the government an estimated $170 million a year.</p>
        <p>A 1987 law directed the Health Care Financing Administration to study the adequacy of Medicare payments for chemotherapy services in doctors' offices. The study, due for completion by April 1, 1989, was never done.</p>
        <p>In effect, Medicare officials said today, they will now do the study that Congress ordered 13 years ago. But it  will not be easy to change the Medicare payment formula so that it accurately reflects the special costs incurred in outpatient cancer care. Terry S. Coleman, former chief counsel of the Medicare program, said, ''The reimbursement methodology is so complicated you can't just go in and adjust a few billing codes.''</p>
        <p>While putting off cuts in payment for cancer drugs, Medicare officials said they would proceed with previously announced plans to cut payments for drugs used at kidney dialysis centers and in the treatment of emphysema and other lung diseases, starting Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>People with irreversible kidney failure typically go to a dialysis center three times a week to have waste cleaned from the blood. They receive drugs for bone disease and anemia.</p>
        <p>Dolph Chianchiano, director of public policy at the National Kidney Foundation, said, ''As a result of the cuts being made by the government, Medicare patients may be unable to obtain the drugs they need, or they may have to make a special visit to a hospital each week to get the drugs'' -- assuming that hospitals are willing to provide them to outpatients at the reduced rates.</p>
        <p>One example illustrates how the cuts could have affected cancer care.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dean H. Gesme, president of the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, an advocacy group for patients, works with four other doctors at a clinic with 4,000 to 5,000 patients in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gesme said today that the cuts would have cost his clinic $300,000 to $500,000 a year. Currently, he said, the clinic, Oncology Associates, receives $2 million to $2.5 million a year in payments from Medicare for drugs and $400,000 for the services of doctors and nurses who administer the drugs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gesme said the clinic did not make any money on Medicare chemotherapy, deriving all its profits from privately insured patients.</p>
        <p>The changes planned by the Clinton administration would have directly affected only Medicare reimbursement. But Dr. Gesme said, ''When Medicare makes sweeping cuts, private insurers often follow suit, assuming that the government must be right.''</p>
        <p>Melissa T. Skolfield, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said, ''The oncologists raised some legitimate concerns.'' Ms. Skolfield said Dr. Shalala was not aware that Medicare was underpaying for such services when she announced the cuts in May.</p>
        <p>But Medicare officials have long been aware of the problem. A notice published in the Federal Register in 1988 acknowledged that Medicare ''may fail to compensate adequately for the services'' of doctors and nurses providing chemotherapy.</p>
