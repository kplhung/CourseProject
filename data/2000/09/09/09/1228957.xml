        <p>An 18-year-old woman was recovering yesterday from injuries she suffered in a vicious brawl on a Manhattan subway platform Tuesday afternoon, the police said.</p>
        <p>The authorities said the fight took place on the Canal Street subway platform after the victim, Maureen Matthews of Manhattan, and the assailant, a woman who is still at large, left the southbound A train.</p>
        <p>The police said that for reasons that are not clear, Ms. Matthews and the other woman exchanged hostile words and then began fighting, with the other woman bashing Ms. Matthews's head against the concrete floor of the platform. Ms. Matthews's 20-year-old sister, Selena, tried to intervene but was held down by three men who were accompanying the other woman, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for NYU Downtown Hospital said that Ms. Matthews was in stable condition yesterday.</p>
