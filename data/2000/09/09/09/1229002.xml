        <p>At first glance, Eric Harding appears to be another notch in Roy Jones Jr.'s legacy, a worthy challenger gunning for an upset against one of boxing's greatest champions.</p>
        <p>They meet Saturday night in a 12-round championship fight at the New Orleans Arena. If Harding (19-0-1, 6 knockouts) has any chance to take Jones's undisputed light heavyweight titles, it will be because of a left-handed approach and deceptive power that makes him Jones's most credible opponent since Reggie Johnson in June, 1999.</p>
        <p>Then again, Jones (42-1, 34) thrives on these moments of speculation and comparison. Although he failed to knock out Johnson, another left-hander, he floored Johnson twice and won every round while unifying the light heavyweight titles with one of his most dazzling performances.</p>
        <p>Harding enters the pay-per-view bout (TVKO, 9 p.m. Eastern time) two inches taller at 6-feet 1 inch and with a two-and-a-half-inch edge in reach. The fighters weighed in at almost identical weights, Jones at 173 1/2 pounds, Harding at 173 3/4.</p>
        <p>''My height, my reach, me being a left-hander and my speed,'' Harding said, ticking off reasons why Jones should be wary. ''My style is a style he hasn't seen.''</p>
        <p>Unfazed by what Harding considered to be advantages, Jones simply agreed.</p>
        <p>''He's got a very awkward style,'' Jones said. ''His punches come in at some awkward angles. ''He's totally different from what I've faced before. Not a problem, but totally different.''</p>
        <p>Harding is not known as a knockout artist, but he has worked to increase his power to prepare for Jones. Harding now throws punches from more of a lower, coiled position rather than lunging forward while trying to unload bombs.</p>
        <p>''Does he hit as hard as Jones? I don't know,'' said Al Gavin, Harding's trainer. ''But he can win this fight. He truly believes that. We've got as good a chance as anybody who's been in the ring with Roy.''</p>
        <p>Harding owns a proven, yet unspectacular, record and earned his shot at Jones with a solid 12-round decision against Antonio Tarver on June 23. Harding punished Tarver in the title elimination fight, breaking Tarver's jaw and two ribs.</p>
        <p>In a victory that surely caught Jones's attention, Harding won a close split-decision over Montell Griffin, who handed Jones his only loss, albeit on a disqualification. Harding fought Griffin on only four days notice in November 1998, and took him to 12 rounds for the first time Griffin's career.</p>
        <p>Another of Harding's quality victories came against Ray Berry, although no matter what an opponent has done, Jones seems more bemused than impressed.</p>
        <p>''Eric is coming to do what he has to do,'' Jones said. ''But that's what I like about Eric. I know he's been up against a lot of adversity and he's been able to come back. Those are the type of stories I like to see.''</p>
        <p>Jones said: ''I respect the strength that he has. No one ever gave him anything, but I didn't get to be champ by laying down for anyone. I'm glad Eric is coming to win. I want all my opponents to come to win. I'm looking forward to this challenge.''</p>
        <p>A high school dropout at age 16, Harding's troubled past was chronicled more in police reports than boxing stories. The 27-year-old from Philadelphia estimated he has spent from two to three years in jail. He said he has been shot twice, once in the hand and once in the leg. A stab wound from a jailhouse fight also serves as a reminder of how far Harding has come.</p>
        <p>''Nobody can intimidate me,'' said Harding, who began boxing at age 12. ''I wasn't scared of the guys who shot and stabbed me, so why should I be scared of him?''</p>
        <p>Harding is expected to earn $600,000 for the fight. Jones's payday will be decided by the gate and the pay-per-view audience, the promoter Mural Muhammad said. ''There is no purse for him as such,'' Muhammad said. ''Roy has chosen to invest in himself in this fight.'' Jones's take will be based on what remains after expenses, which Muhammad listed at $3.5 million.</p>
        <p>''He's got a lot of heart, and he beats people he's not supposed to beat,'' Jones said of Harding. ''He reminds me of what I was like when I was coming</p>
        <p>up. He takes whatever you put in front of him and he deals with it.'</p>
