        <p>As anyone who has spent time in Brazil can attest, Brazilian celebrations don't usually require elaborate justifications. Still, several were offered as reasons for the concert of Brazilian orchestral music that the consulate general of Brazil sponsored at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday evening.</p>
        <p>Most immediately, Thursday was Brazil's Independence Day. The concert also honored the 500th anniversary of the country's discovery in 1500. The Millennium Summit at the United Nations was also cited.</p>
        <p>In more purely musical terms, the concert was a way to put the spotlight on a side of Brazil's culture that is generally overshadowed by its success in the world of global pop. In that regard the program was slightly disappointing. Although it included United States premieres of a 1934 work by Francisco Mignone and a 1959 score by Heitor Villa-Lobos, the Villa-Lobos was the most recent work on the program. There were no works by living composers, nothing to show what Brazilian composers have been up to for the last 40 years.</p>
        <p>Nelson Nirenberg, a Brazilian who divides his time between Rio de Janeiro and Montclair, N.J., conducted the New York Chamber Symphony. He opened the program with the Sinfonia from ''Fosca,'' an opera by Antonio Carlos Gomes. Gomes, a contemporary of Verdi, was in vogue in Italy in the late 19th century. He assimilated the Italian opera style completely, and this overture has it all: gracefully winding woodwind themes, big ominous brass chords, a section given to quietly haunting string writing that bowed to ''La Traviata,'' and tub-thumping bombast in the final pages.</p>
        <p>The rest of the short first half was devoted to Mignone's ''Fantasia Brasileira'' No. 3, a compact, sparkling work for piano and orchestra. Unlike the Gomes, which is a thoroughly European work, the Mignone draws on quintessentially Brazilian elements -- the same ones, in fact, that continue to make Brazilian popular music and jazz so lively and so easily placed. Syncopated rhythms and playfully dissonant harmonies drive the piano part, and the orchestral fabric has the kind of distinctive coloration that Copland and Bernstein borrowed when they wanted to evoke a Latin American atmosphere. Not quite a piano concerto, it nevertheless offers some dazzling moments, and Linda Bustani, the soloist, made the most of them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nirenberg closed the concert with two works by Villa-Lobos. The Preludio from the ''Bachianas Brasileiras'' No. 4 is steeped in rich, deep string sonorities that evoke a 1940's vintage view of Bach. The belated premiere was the Suite No. 2, a five-movement work composed a few months before Villa-Lobos's death in 1959. It has its dark moments, not least in the opening ''Lamento.'' But this is hardly a deathbed rumination: the Scherzo is bright and cosmopolitan, and the ''Macumba,'' with its sweeping strings, vivid brass writing and insistent percussion, closes with a grandly cinematic flourish.</p>
        <p>The orchestra was in fine shape for much of the program. Moments of ragged ensemble and strident string tone marred parts of the Villa-Lobos Suite, but in the work's finale the orchestra's playing was bright and energetic, and it brought an appealing warmth and suppleness to the Gomes and the Villa-Lobos Preludio.</p>
