        <p>Three days after the Nassau County executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, presented his plan to rescue the county's finances, the question facing officials here today was not whether the county still faces a budget crisis. It was whether there was any way out of it short of a humiliating state takeover of the county's finances.</p>
        <p>Officials in the Democratic and Republican Parties reacted with skepticism, at times tinged with anger, when Mr. Gulotta presented a plan Tuesday to cut $143 million from the 2001 budget, largely by raising property taxes by 4 percent and laying off more than 350 county employees. Officials said that Mr. Gulotta's figures did not add up and that the plan was short on specifics.</p>
        <p>The pessimism deepened today as Mr. Gulotta presented a four-year budget plan that included a projected $207 million deficit for 2004, and as he sought costly pay increases for county police officers who are already among the highest paid in the nation. Unless the county comes up with a credible balanced budget plan by mid-October it faces a takeover of its finances by the Nassau Interim Financing Authority, known as NIFA. The state established the agency  to help the county restructure its debt.</p>
        <p>Nassau's long-term debt, as of December 1999, was $2.6 billion, said Todd A. Whitestone, managing director of the Wall Street credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's, which earlier this year lowered Nassau's bond status to one step above junk. Each  resident's share of the county's debt is $2,065. That is more than twice as much as  any other county in New York and more than six times the state average.</p>
        <p>But in order to receive $105 million in state aid over the next five years, part of the agreement to create NIFA, Nassau, an otherwise wealthy county, had to agree to a strict schedule: come up with a total of $70 million in spending cuts and revenue increases million in both 2001 and 2002 and $80 million in 2003.</p>
        <p>Few officials would say publicly today that state control was inevitable, but officials in both parties agreed it was now a distinct possibility -- perhaps a likelihood.</p>
        <p>''We're definitely headed in that direction,'' said Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the majority leader of the County Legislature. ''And it's going to take serious corrective action to divert a control board from taking over.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, even Republicans said the county's credibility had hit rock bottom. And even if officials come up with a rescue plan, the oversight board might not accept it.</p>
        <p>Robert Lazaro, a spokesman for the Peter Schmitt, a Republican, and the minority leader of the Legislature, said, ''Our biggest fear is that both sides of the Legislature will come together and fix the problem but shortly thereafter NIFA will morph into a control board because they don't have confidence in the administration to administer the solutions.''</p>
        <p>One state official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said of Mr. Gulotta's budget figures: ''I'm not sure there's a lot of people who have a lot of faith in any of this material. If this is all there was, I think there would be a control board very quickly.''</p>
        <p>Said another: ''The level of discomfort among the NIFA board is palpable.''</p>
        <p>The county is facing enormous hurdles. Drastic reductions in the county work force, the exodus of longtime top officials and the resolution of contracts with thousands of  union employees are looming. Part of what is troubling many officials is an effort by Mr. Gulotta to increase the salaries for county police officers and detectives, by more than 22 percent each over the next five years, and for correction officers, by nearly 30 percent over seven years.</p>
        <p>Dianne Baumert-Moyik, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gulotta, said the proposed raises come with $60 million in savings through union concessions. According to the proposal Mr. Gulotta submitted to NIFA, the plan for the Police Benevolent Association would add ''to annual longevity costs'' in the third, fourth and fifth years of the agreement. Some critics raised questions about whether other lucrative provisions would cause payouts to retiring officers to mushroom.</p>
        <p>''It provides too generous a benefit, over and above the cost of living, on top of what is a more than fairly paid police force,'' Fred Parola, a Republican and the county comptroller, said of the proposed contracts, which would need legislative approval to be enacted. ''And we don't even know what the fringe benefits are.''</p>
        <p>Still, Michael F. Adams, the president of the Nassau County Sheriff Officers Association, called the proposed raises modest and said he would like even more money for the 1,068 correction officers who work at the county jail, in East Meadow.</p>
        <p>''The correction officers have not had a raise for three and a half years,'' he said. ''In these times, other concessions have to be made in other areas. The county administration can't take it out solely on the back of correction officers.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps, many said today, the biggest problem the county is facing is Mr. Gulotta, the man at the center of the budget storm.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Gulotta's problem is his credibility is greatly suspect,'' said Mr. Parola, the comptroller. ''He has a long track record of budgetary submissions that have not held up. The numbers as presented in the budgets have not withstood either reality or close scrutiny.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Baumert-Moyik defended Mr. Gulotta's credibility and argued that he is providing leadership in tough fiscal times. She defended the county executive's multiyear plan as a working draft and said ''the legislators still have to provide consensus opinion on the initiatives that the county executive has outlined.''</p>
        <p>She disputed the notion that a control board was inevitable, saying that ''the legislators and the county executive are committed to solving the fiscal issues so that NIFA stands as an oversight board and not as a control board.''</p>
        <p>And Ms. Jacobs, too, said a control board was not a certainty.</p>
        <p>Once it gets Mr. Gulotta's final budget next Friday, the Legislature could increase property taxes even more than the 4 percent -- or $33 per household -- that he has proposed. It could make further spending cuts.</p>
        <p>The Legislature will have until mid-October to act. And it will have a ruling on Mr. Gulotta's plan from Frank G. Zarb, who is Gov. George E. Pataki's special adviser in the matter, to take into account. Some raised the question today of whether NIFA could provide more aid under the law that created the board.</p>
        <p>Darren Bloch, chief of staff to the Democratic legislative majority, said: ''I think we have a tremendously difficult task ahead of us, but there is still time and there is still the will to accomplish the task at hand. It is an uphill battle. But we're the last line of defense.''</p>
