      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Goldman Sachs Group, the investment banking firm, is in serious talks to acquire Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg, the biggest maker of markets in listed stocks and one of the biggest traders on the Nasdaq stock market, according to a person with knowledge of the talks.</p>
        <p>Negotiations continued as the weekend neared and may not be completed, this person said.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on the matter. Executives of Spear, Leeds, a private company, did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
        <p>The purchase, if completed would be Goldman's biggest since it went public in May 1999. Goldman has shown interest in acquiring one of the leading Nasdaq trading firms to increase its role in electronic trading of stocks, especially those of popular technology companies like Microsoft, Cisco Systems and WorldCom.</p>
        <p>Last September, Goldman paid $531 million for the Hull Group, a Chicago-based electronic trading firm that buys and sells futures, options and stocks electronically on 28 exchanges in nine countries.</p>
        <p>Goldman officials considered buying Herzog Heine Geduld, a market maker based in Jersey City, before Merrill Lynch &amp; Company bought that firm in mid-July for Merrill shares worth about $1 billion. Analysts said Spear, Leeds, which earned $846 million on revenue of $2.7 billion in the nine months ended June 30, could be worth several times what Merrill paid for Herzog.</p>
        <p>Buying Spear, Leeds, the fourth-biggest Nasdaq market maker, would give Goldman a 21 percent stake in Redibook, one of a new breed of electronic exchanges known as electronic communication networks. Earlier this year, Spear, Leeds sold shares of Redibook to other financial firms, including Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab.</p>
        <p>It also would make Goldman the biggest specialist firm on the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange. Specialists operate trading posts on the floor of an exchange at which they match up buyers and sellers for particular stocks and often use their own money to buy or sell shares. Their numbers have been dwindling through a series of mergers and some analysts fear that with the trend toward more electronic trading, specialists will gradually lose their value.</p>
