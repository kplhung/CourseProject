        <p>Ron Dayne says that one day he wants to qualify for the Olympics as a discus thrower.</p>
        <p>Dayne, a standout discus thrower and shot-putter at Overbook Regional High School in Berlin, N.J., competed in the Penn Relays and still has aspirations of resuming his track and field career.</p>
        <p>''No matter how long it takes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dayne threw the discus 216 feet 11 inches in 1996, a mark only two others have exceeded on the high school level. Later that spring he won the shot-put at the Penn Relays to qualify for the Olympic trials, which he turned down to focus on football.</p>
        <p>Dayne, who at 5 feet 10 inches, 253 pounds looks more like a shot-putter than a running back, ran for 78 yards and a touchdown last week in his National Football League debut with the Giants, a victory over the Arizona Cardinals.</p>
        <p>''We want to welcome Ron Dayne to the N.F.L.,'' Eagles middle linebacker Jeremiah Trotter said.</p>
        <p>The Eagles have some familiarity with Dayne. Quarterbacks coach Brad Childress was the offensive coordinator at Wisconsin during Dayne's first three years with the Badgers. Philadelphia fullback Cecil Martin was Dayne's teammate for three years.</p>
        <p>Garnes Still Out</p>
        <p>Sam Garnes again watched practice from the sideline today, which means that Lyle West will probably start at strong safety Sunday. Garnes has not been involved in hitting drills since sustaining a concussion Sunday against Arizona. Coach Jim Fassel did not include Garnes or tight end Pete Mitchell among the four inactive players he submitted to the league today. But Garnes could be deactivated Sunday.</p>
        <p>Garnes's expected absence leaves the Giants with a big hole in their secondary. At 6 feet and 215 pounds, West doesn't measure up to the 6-3, 225-pound Garnes. Both Fassel and defensive backs coach Johnnie Lynn were confident in West, who started all four preseason games at free safety in place of the injured Shaun Williams.</p>
        <p>''Lyle made dramatic strides this preseason,'' said Fassel, who wouldn't say whether West will play strong safety or switch positions with free safety Williams. ''He got better. That's one of the reasons I got more confidence in him.''</p>
        <p>Fassel said the coaching staff discussed briefly playing Omar Stoutmire, who was signed last week after being cut by the Jets, instead of West, but opted for West's experience with the defense. West, a quiet presence in the locker room, has become more vocal in his second season.</p>
        <p>''Now you're out there just playing football,'' he said. ''Before, when you're a younger player, you're trying to learn the defense, you're not as confident so you're not going to say something because you're afraid it's going to be wrong.''</p>
        <p>Playing mostly on special teams, West had a forgettable rookie season. He ended the preseason by allowing a game-winning touchdown when he went for an interception and failed to knock the ball from the receiver. Last November, West served a four-game suspension for violating the N.F.L.'s substance-abuse policy. He said an anti-inflammatory medication he had received from his doctor for a strained hamstring contained an anabolic steroid. He blamed himself for not clearing the prescription with the league.</p>
        <p>Mitchell, meanwhile, will most likely serve as the emergency long snapper on Sunday. He has been limited in practice this week and has not played with the first unit offense in more than a month. If he plays Sunday, he would be subjected to Veterans Stadium's unforgiving artificial turf. Mitchell sustained his injury in the Giants' first preseason game.</p>
        <p>''I'll be disappointed but it won't be something that will throw us out of whack,'' said Fassel, who had hoped to have Mitchell for this game. ''The way we planned is without him.''</p>
