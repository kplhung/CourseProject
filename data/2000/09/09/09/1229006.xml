        <p>The Knicks, the Seattle SuperSonics and the Los Angeles Lakers have resurrected trade talks concerning Patrick Ewing. The clubs are discussing a three-team deal that would send Ewing to Seattle, Glen Rice from Los Angeles to the Knicks and Horace Grant from the Sonics to the Lakers, three National Basketball Association officials said last night.</p>
        <p>As many as five other marginal players could be involved to make the trade fit the requirements of the collective bargaining agreement, with the Knicks and the Lakers possibly swapping backup centers -- Chris Dudley and Travis Knight, respectively. The Knicks might also have to take a few reserves from Seattle, possibly center Vladimir Stepania and forward Lazaro Borrell.</p>
        <p>Seattle and Los Angeles are ready to pull the trigger, leaving the fate of the deal in the Knicks' hands, according to two of the N.B.A. officials. Neither Scott Layden, the Knicks' general manager, nor Coach Jeff Van Gundy could be reached for comment. Wally Walker, the Sonics' president, refused to discuss the possible trade when reached last night by telephone.</p>
        <p>Last month, the Knicks, the Sonics and the Lakers came close to completing what would have been the largest trade in league history, but the four-team, 13-player deal was foiled when the Detroit Pistons backed out at the last moment.</p>
        <p>That deal would have also sent Ewing to Seattle, but the Knicks would have received Vin Baker, a four-time All-Star forward and a member of this year's Olympic team, from the Sonics, along with Rice and Knight from Los Angeles. The Lakers would have received Dudley and Detroit's Christian Laettner.</p>
        <p>The Pistons, who would have received seven marginal players in the deal, pulled out because of fan backlash and because the Dallas Mavericks offered Cedric Ceballos for Laettner on the day the deal was supposed to be completed. Dallas and Detroit completed that trade two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>The botched trade became a nightmare for the Knicks because Ewing was widely criticized by the news media and the New York fans when it was believed that he would be traded. Since then, several league officials have stated that Ewing is adamant about not returning to New York for his 16th season.</p>
        <p>Just days after the four-team trade fell apart, Layden said the Knicks would continue to seek opportunities to trade Ewing. He added that Ewing and his agent, David Falk, had helped orchestrate the possible trade and that they would remain involved in future talks.</p>
        <p>The Knicks, who discussed a possible deal with Washington of Ewing for Juwan Howard, have coveted Rice all summer. But the Lakers were not willing to deal the sharp-shooting forward unless they received a solid power forward in return. Grant, 35, fits the bill. While the Knicks would love to get Rice, whom they would acquire in a sign-and-trade agreement, he and possibly Knight, are not much of a return for Ewing. If this latest proposed trade is completed, it could be a prelude to a second trade by the Knicks.</p>
        <p>There was speculation that the Knicks would have traded Allan Houston and possibly Marcus Camby to Atlanta for Dikembe Mutombo if the four-team deal occurred, believing that the team does not need Rice, Houston and Latrell Sprewell.</p>
        <p>Officials from both the Knicks and the Atlanta Hawks have repeatedly denied that such a trade would have taken place.</p>
