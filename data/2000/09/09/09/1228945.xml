        <p>''The Far Side of the Moon,'' a theater piece written, directed and performed by the Canadian theater artist Robert Lepage, is being offered as part of the Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater, but it's not puppetry that commands the stage -- it's Mr. Lepage.</p>

        <p>''The Far Side of the Moon,'' a theater piece written, directed and performed by the Canadian theater artist Robert Lepage, is being offered as part of the Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater, but it's not puppetry that commands the stage -- it's Mr. Lepage.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the puppets here are decidedly secondary figures, not much more than props. They're done up as astronauts, and they make only a handful of brief appearances as dream figures; they're part of the metaphorical backdrop of this show, which posits the race to the moon by the United States and the former Soviet Union as a kind of sibling rivalry, and space exploration in general as a symbol of the desperate rooting around in the dark that characterizes human relationships.</p>
        <p>Yes, that is ponderous baggage for what is otherwise a piquant and simple story about estranged brothers after their mother's death. But the heavy-handedness of Mr. Lepage's connections between inner and outer space is easily -- and perhaps properly -- overlooked.</p>
        <p>Partly this is because the rest of his show, with the visual cleverness characteristic of Mr. Lepage and his company, Ex Machina, is so modest and engaging, and partly it's because of Mr. Lepage's virtuoso acting performance here.</p>
        <p>An unimposing presence with a doughy face and physique, he plays the two brothers -- Philippe, a haplessly introspective philosophy student, and Andre, a television weatherman with the chilly impatience of the deeply selfish -- as well as host of secondary characters, and it's a tour de force of unactorlike ease.</p>
        <p>As a doctor explaining to Philippe that his mother's death was no accident; as Philippe, working as a telemarketer and, in a painful coincidence, reaching a potential customer who turns out to be a former girlfriend, now married; as Andre, stuck in an elevator with a bookshelf full of remembrances from his childhood, Mr. Lepage is uncanny in his casual verisimilitude; you'll never see a performance that yields a more powerful sense of peeking in on someone who thinks he's alone.</p>
        <p>The show (which can be seen at the Joseph Papp Public Theater for three more performances, two today and one tomorrow) is told in a series of blackout scenes, each with its own bit of theatrics that please with their unspectacular ingenuity. There's the laundromat evoked by a couple of chairs, a water cooler, a porthole in the back wall and a behind-the-wall camera that projects the inside of a washing machine onto a screen for the audience. There's a hotel lounge, empty except for Philippe, whose loneliness and isolation are underscored by the vast stage-length mirrored tabletop that serves as the bar at which he sits smoking. There's a whole gymnasium full of exercise equipment suggested by, of all things, an ironing board.</p>
        <p>The simplicity of much of this is nearly obscured by the space race metaphor -- in a kind of accompanying sideshow, the history of American and Russian space programs is told in vintage film clips, projections and radio recordings -- and by a weird and beautiful original score by Laurie Anderson, whose syncopations and vaguely Asian-sounding dissonances give the show an aura of avant-garde profundity.</p>
        <p>But the strength of the show, the conventional realism of the emotions of the characters, shines through in Mr. Lepage's acting and in the simple elegance of his visual imagination almost in spite of these overlays.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lepage is not known for narrative economy, and the show, which runs nearly two and a half hours without intermission, proceeds at a languid pace. But if it asks an audience for patience, the narrative shape, seemingly indifferent to conventional peaks and valleys, also contributes to the idea that real lives are being glimpsed.</p>
        <p>The story focuses on Philippe, a shy fellow whose intellectual pursuits reflect the sort of nebbishy sadness that is played out in his personal life. (His doctoral thesis contends that ''man's interest in space travel is motivated not by curiosity but narcissism.'') He's devoted to honoring the memory of his mother in tiny ways; the care of her goldfish, for instance, becomes a crucial issue between him and Andre, a shallow, mercenary fellow who is driven nuts by his older brother's ineffectuality and introspection.</p>
        <p>Much of Philippe's own sense of failure is communicated through a video he makes for an organization called SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, a personal documentary, of sorts, that is to be digitized and sent off into the void like a message in a bottle.</p>
        <p>The idea is the contrast: Philippe's eagerness to send the mundane details of life into the void, as opposed to the vast technological machinery that the United States and Russia spent decades launching away from the earth. The one, the show suggests, is human; the other merely egomaniacal, creating dangerous misunderstandings between nations and brothers.</p>
        <p>That's a sentimental and not terribly complex idea, and one wishes it wasn't presented with such, well, gravity. In the end the space metaphor is best when it is least grandiose, when it isn't so conscious of its own epic proportions.</p>
        <p>A climactic scene in which Mr. Lepage, as Philippe, mimics weightlessness in the laundromat (helped by a wonderful and uncomplicated use of mirrors) is partly terrific. That's because what it says about a man -- that he's unmoored even in the most unethereal circumstance -- is moving, but what it says about mankind -- the same thing -- is merely weighty. Sometimes a small step is preferable to a giant leap.</p>
        <p>THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON  Written, directed and performed by Robert Lepage; written with the collaboration of Adam Nashman; artistic collaborator and project originator, Peder Bjurman; assistant to the director, Pierre-Philippe Guay; original music composed and recorded by Laurie Anderson; assistant set designer, Marie-Claude Pelletier; costumes by Marie-Chantale Vaillancourt; puppet designer, Pierre Robitaille and Sylvie Courbron; puppeteer, Pierre Bernier. Produced by Ex Machina and presented by the Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater. At the Joseph Papp Public Theater/Newman Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village.</p>
