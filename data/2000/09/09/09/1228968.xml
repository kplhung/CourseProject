        <p>Racing returned to the metropolitan area yesterday after six weeks at Saratoga, as Belmont opened a 33-day meeting of shakedown tests for some of the country's leading horses on the road to the Breeders' Cup.</p>
        <p>The Belmont barns were filled with heavy hitters, led by Lemon Drop Kid and Fusaichi Pegasus, the ranking candidates for Horse of the Year. They arrived by different routes with different agendas.</p>
        <p>Lemon Drop Kid, the winner in five of his last six starts, came straight from Saratoga, where he won the Whitney Handicap last month and became the leader pro tem in the race for Horse of the Year. He will take up the trail again next Saturday as the favorite in the $500,000 Woodward, and again Oct. 14 in the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup. After that: the Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 4 at Churchill Downs.</p>
        <p>But Lemon Drop Kid will be racing under the huge shadow of Fusaichi Pegasus, the 3-year-old superstar who won the Kentucky Derby in May. Because of a foot injury, Pegasus has not raced since he ran second in the Preakness. He might stage a comeback in next month's Jockey Club Gold Cup.</p>
        <p>Belmont opened its fall season of 40 stakes races before a small crowd of 4,482, a significant meltdown from the average crowd of 27,000 at Saratoga. The General Douglas MacArthur, a $75,000 handicap for horses foaled in New York State, was won by Say Florida Sandy, who scored by a length and a quarter over Hearts at Risk and paid $10.60 for a $2 bet.</p>
        <p>In terms of quality competition and purses, the meeting turns serious today with two of the 14 Grade I stakes booked for the fall. Eight horses will compete in the $500,000 Man o'War, led by the 9-year-old phenomenon John's Call. Eight fillies will run in the $200,000 Gazelle, led by Secret Status, winner of the Kentucky Oaks and the Mother Goose.</p>
        <p>The Man o'War, at a mile and three-eighths on the grass, brings three international stars from Europe: Fantastic Light, who won the $2 million Dubai Sheema Classic in March; Timboroa, who raced in Grade I company in France and Italy; and Ela Athena, a 4-year-old filly from England. But they will have to catch John's Call, who won the Sword Dancer Sheema Classic in March; Timboroa, who raced in Grade I company in France and Italy; and Ela Athena, a 4-year-old filly from England. But they will have to catch John's Call, who won the Sword Dancer last month by more than nine lengths and who has run first or second in 25 of his 32 starts.</p>
