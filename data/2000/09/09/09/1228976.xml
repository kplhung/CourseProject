        <p>The company that owns the Yankees made a new offer to the Madison Square Garden Network yesterday in an attempt to break a legal deadlock over who will broadcast the team's games over the next decade.</p>
        <p>In a letter to top officials, the YankeeNets partnership asked the Garden, in essence, to pay slightly more than $1 billion for the broadcast rights to Yankees games for the next 10 years. If the Garden balks at the price, the Yankees will go ahead with plans to set up their own cable network, officials at the partnership said.</p>
        <p>There was no immediate response from Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden. ''We are confirming that we received the letter and we will be reviewing the contents,'' said Cara Taback, a network representative.</p>
        <p>The offer was the latest move in a tangled battle between the MSG Network and the YankeeNets partners, who also own the Nets basketball team and the Devils hockey franchise.</p>
        <p>For months, the partnership has been laboring to set up its own cable network to carry the games of all three teams, eliminating MSG as a middleman and pocketing the profits from advertisers directly.</p>
        <p>Not suprisingly, MSG has fought the effort in court, since the Yankees are their biggest draw. MSG claimed in a lawsuit that, under their current contract with the Yankees that expires at the end of this season, they have a right to match any offer from a third party bidding for the ''exploitation rights'' to Yankees games.</p>
        <p>MSG has owned the Yankees television rights since 1988, when the network paid $493.5 million for a 12-year deal. At the time, the sum stunned the sports and television industries because it was bigger than any other for local broadcasts in the country. The money has fueled the growth of the Yankees' payroll, which in turn helped to bring them three World Series titles in the last four years.</p>
        <p>The Yankees think their television rights are worth much more than $493 million now -- at least $1 billion in present-day value and more than $2 billion if paid for incrementally over 10 years.</p>
        <p>In June, the Yankees had proposed starting a new network with the International Management Group under a structure in which the partnership would retain 95 percent of the ownership. To satisfy the contract with MSG, the Yankees proposed letting MSG match the offer by buying the 5 percent share the International Management Group was to have in the new cable company.</p>
        <p>MSG officials said the offer was a disingenuous concoction aimed at getting around their right to match bids from other parties. They sued in state court, arguing the 5 percent slice was peanuts considering that MSG had controlled the television rights to all Yankees games in the previous deal.</p>
        <p>Judge Barry A. Cozier agreed with them and issued an injunction. ''The Yankees are offering 5 percent and calling it a full loaf,'' he wrote. ''You cannot convert a 100 percent interest into a 5 percent interest.'' The judge also said the Yankees had to place a monetary value on the rights.</p>
        <p>In the new offer, the Yankees are seeking to simplify the deal. First, the partnership has withdrawn the previous proposal, rendering the lawsuit moot, Yankees officials maintained. Second, the partnership has taken the Nets and Devils off the table, leaving MSG with only the the Yankees rights to bid on. Third, the Yankees have hired several investment bankers, among them Morgan Stanley, to come up with a present-day value for those rights, a figure exceeding $1 billion.</p>
        <p>''We followed the judges instructions to a T,'' one Yankees official said, on condition of anonymity. ''They either match it or they don't match it.''</p>
        <p>An official with the YankeeNets said if MSG agrees to pay the $1 billion, the partnership will drop plans for a new network. ''If MSG agrees to pay, we are done,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Though MSG officials declined to comment yesterday, one tactic they may take is to attack the price as exhorbitantly high and thus not a bona fide offer. In the past, the Yankees have been more conservative in their estimates of revenues from the new cable network, placing it at around $900 million.</p>
        <p>The stakes are high for the Garden. The Yankees are crucially important to the MSG Network, which was bought by Cablevision in 1993. MSG's subscriber base has grown from 2.3 million to 7.6 million since it acquired the Yankees' television rights. Not only have Yankees advertisers bought time for Knicks and Rangers games, but revenues from the baseball games have also softened the blow when the Knicks and the Rangers, teams owned by MSG, have faltered.</p>
        <p>Under the contract, MSG has seven days to respond to the offer.</p>
