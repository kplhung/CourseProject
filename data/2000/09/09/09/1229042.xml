        <p>In a cease-fire after five years of hostilities, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and former Mayor Edward I. Koch took to the airwaves yesterday to declare a common bond in trying to unseat certain Democrats in the New York State Assembly. Their targets are Assembly members who voted last year for the repeal of the commuter tax, which has carved deeply into New York City revenues.</p>
        <p>The two men, appearing on Mayor Giuliani's weekly radio call-in program on WABC-AM, sounded like stalwart allies. ''I think Ed Koch has the best interests of the city at heart,'' Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch added, ''You and I are joined in this battle.''</p>
        <p>The unexpected alliance, which could provide potent support for several Assembly candidates, surfaced after a week of more subtle signs of reconciliation between the two men, who had a bitter falling-out over the selection of criminal court judges in 1995.</p>
        <p>That fight led to a spate of name-calling over the years and a series of more serious battles: Mr. Koch refused to endorse Mr. Giuliani in his 1997 re-election campaign (although he has said he voted for the mayor), and last year, Mr. Koch published a collection of his biting newspaper columns in a book called ''Giuliani: Nasty Man.''</p>
        <p>The thaw first became apparent on Tuesday when Mr. Koch accepted an invitation to City Hall -- his first since 1995 -- to attend the swearing-in ceremony for Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik. And on Thursday, the eve of their joint radio appearance, Mr. Koch joined Mr. Giuliani in a City Hall endorsement of Patrick O'Malley, a Queens Democrat who is challenging Catherine T. Nolan, a Democrat and eight-term incumbent in the 37th Assembly District. Ms. Nolan earned the wrath of the two mayors by voting in favor of repealing New York City's commuter tax for people who work in the city but live elsewhere in the state.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Koch said yesterday that he had a ''different personal feeling'' toward Mr. Giuliani since the mayor announced earlier this year that he had been given a diagnosis of prostate cancer. ''He has been a good mayor in a whole host of areas,'' Mr. Koch said.</p>
        <p>In the next breath, however, he said not to expect close personal ties. ''He certainly doesn't invite me to his home,'' Mr. Koch said, ''nor would I invite him to mine.''</p>
        <p>Instead of a sudden burst of affection, the bond displayed yesterday between Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Koch appeared to be forged in anger -- for once not at each other, but against Assembly Democrats whom they have branded traitors. The result of the tax repeal, Mr. Giuliani said yesterday, was a loss of $500 million to $600 million a year for the city.</p>
        <p>''The worst part is that representatives of New York voted for this,'' Mayor Giuliani said on the radio yesterday.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't say it better myself,''  Mr. Koch added.</p>
        <p>The most prominent targets of the two mayors' anger yesterday were Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, and Ms. Nolan.</p>
        <p>''We want to establish that if you are going to be a traitor to New York City, you are in danger of losing your seat,'' Mr. Koch said.</p>
        <p>Besides Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Koch said, he would endorse any ''mainstream challenger'' to the Assembly Democrats who favored the repeal, regardless of party affiliation, and expected Mr. Giuliani to do so as well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver responded in an interview that Mr. Koch and Mr. Giuliani ''should take the time to stop this demagoguery and consider the record'' of the Assembly on matters like education and health care.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nolan, after a second day of assaults, said she was taken off guard by the vehemence of the mayoral challenge. ''This thing has gotten out of hand,'' she said. ''You'd think I was the only one who voted'' for the repeal. She added, ''Albany is all about compromises.''</p>
