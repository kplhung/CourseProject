        <p>This is a new 30-second commercial that the New York State Democratic Committee plans to begin broadcasting today.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Axelrod &amp; Associates</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- This is the second commercial the state's Democratic Party has sponsored using what it says are everyday New Yorkers to react to certain positions attributed to Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican opponent of Hillary Rodham Clinton.  The last one, while effective in offering up real voices instead of just those of the candidates, backfired when it was revealed that one of the people interviewed had once worked for a Democratic member of the State Assembly.  This also is the latest in a number of ads partial to Mrs. Clinton that were paid for with ''soft money,'' or largely unregulated contributions that parties are not supposed to use to promote individual candidates. While this advertisement does not urge viewers to vote for Mrs. Clinton, it is clearly an attack on Mr. Lazio's record.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- (Interviewer to individuals)</p>
        <p>''Pardon me, did you know that Rick Lazio voted against funding 100,000 new teachers to reduce class sizes?''  ''No, I didn't. I didn't know that.''</p>
        <p>''No, I did not.''</p>
        <p>''And did you know Lazio voted with Newt Gingrich to eliminate the federal  Department of Education?''  ''That's not good.''</p>
        <p>''I think it's the worst thing he could possibly have done.''</p>
        <p>''And for the largest education cuts in history?''</p>
        <p>''It's horrible, horrible.''</p>
        <p>''Disappointing, very disappointing.''</p>
        <p>''Tell Lazio to stop saying he's for our schools, when he keeps voting against them.''  ''I mean, our kids . . . it's their future, and our future also.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Lazio's campaign insists he did vote to add 100,000 teachers to schools. He also voted for large education cuts, although his campaign asserts that President Clinton had proposed even larger cuts (that were never enacted). Mr. Lazio did not vote explicitly to eliminate the Department of Education; the 1995 bill the ad refers to, however, was a spending measure that did not include financing for the department.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The ad is effective in linking Mr. Lazio again with Mr. Gingrich, renewing a tactic both Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats have revived in recent weeks in an effort to paint Mr. Lazio as more conservative than most New Yorkers. But the party did not release the names of the participants in the ads, which, given the revelation about the previous one, leaves some doubt as to the ad's veracity.</p>
