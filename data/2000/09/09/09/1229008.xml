        <p>His Democratic opponent needled George W. Bush for months about being ''afraid'' to debate. The opponent said he would debate the Texas governor any time, anywhere.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush hemmed and hawed. When the governor finally agreed to debate, his opponent accused him of trying to dictate terms that would reduce the size of the audience.</p>
        <p>If the plot sounds as if it had been lifted from the debate squabbles between Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, think again. The Democratic opponent in question was Garry Mauro, and the election was the 1998 governor's race in Texas. ''Bush's position was he'd do it when the time was right,'' recalled Mr. Mauro, who is a chairman of Mr. Gore's Texas campaign. ''And the time was never right.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides now say that the governor always intended to debate -- a point that seemed less clear in 1998 -- and agreed to a single event late in the race when voters would be paying attention.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush did so only after his campaign was allowed to control when, where and how the debate was conducted, choosing the most remote city in Texas on a night when many people were attending high school football games.</p>
        <p>His staff also dictated the format, ruling out questions from an audience or Capitol reporters in favor of a single moderator, and declining a large auditorium for a small television studio.</p>
        <p>To some degree, Mr. Bush was simply playing the role of a popular incumbent reluctant to share a stage with a long-shot challenger. Despite leading in some polls by more than 50 percentage points, Mr. Bush exhibited the same caution toward debating that he does today, an approach that some now regard as a missed opportunity. Before the presidential campaign, Mr. Bush had participated in only two major debates, against Mr. Mauro in 1998 and against then-Gov. Ann Richards in 1994.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was curious that he didn't take advantage of this to prepare for the presidential race,'' said Richard Murray, a University of Houston political science professor, of the 1998 race. ''Mauro would have been a good sparring partner.''</p>
        <p>Few people believed Mr. Mauro, a former Texas land commissioner, had any chance of unseating Mr. Bush. With little money for advertising, Mr. Mauro had pushed for debates, even accepting an invitation from a radio station to debate the governor inside the ball park of the Texas Rangers, the baseball team once run by Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush had rejected invitations from many organizations before he agreed to a debate in El Paso, sponsored primarily by the local newspaper, that would be held about three weeks before Election Day.</p>
        <p>''The argument that we pushed was that if the governor planned to run for president, it would benefit him to have more than one debate under his belt,'' said Robert Moore, managing editor of The El Paso Times, who had courted the Bush campaign for several months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mauro accused Mr. Bush of trying to orchestrate a debate that no one would watch. El Paso, he noted, was the only city in Texas in the mountain time zone. And by picking a Friday night roughly three weeks before Election Day, Mr. Bush had chosen a time that conflicted with high school football, an ardent passion across Texas.</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said the governor chose El Paso because it had never been the site of a gubernatorial debate, and he wanted to emphasize the importance of voters in West Texas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore said the Bush campaign made several demands. First, he said, they rejected the format used in the lieutenant governor's debate, in which the candidates were asked questions by members of the audience, by a panel of journalists and then by each other.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Bush campaign insisted on a single moderator and asked Mr. Moore to fill that role. Mr. Moore  said the campaign insisted that the two candidates be seated at an oval-shaped table with himself in the middle. ''I would serve as a buffer that might prevent personal attacks,'' said Mr. Moore, who insisted on free rein to ask questions on any topic as well as follow-ups. ''They wanted a very controlled environment for the debate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mauro said the Bush campaign also required that the cameras only be allowed to focus on the moderator and whichever candidate was answering the question as a way of avoiding unguarded reaction shots.  Mr. Bartlett said any prohibitions on the cameras ''doesn't ring a bell with me.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the debate itself was considered something of a dud. Few people watched, and nearly everyone agreed it did not matter, and that, Mr. Mauro contends, is what Mr. Bush wanted all along.</p>
