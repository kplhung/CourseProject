        <p>The United States won the World Women's Team title here tonight, defeating Canada by 32 imps.</p>
        <p>The American team consisted of six Texans: Joan Jackson, Robin Klar, Peggy Sutherlin, Petra Hamman, Shawn Quinn and Mildred Breed, with Bob Hamman as nonplaying captain. The match was close in the early stages, but in the first session of play today, the Americans outscored their opponents 49-8 and held on to win.</p>
        <p>This was the first North American final in the 40-year history of the event. The losing finalists, who had defeated several favored teams in earlier rounds, were Francine Simon, Diana Gordon, Rhoda Habert, Beverly Kraft, Martine Lacroix and Catherine Thorpe.</p>
        <p>In the playoff for third place, the German women beat Norway by 64.</p>
        <p>In the Open series, the Italian team of Norberto Bocchi, Giorgio Duboin, Lorenzo Lauria, Alfredo Versace, Dano de Falco and Guido Ferraro had a close battle against Poland in the early stages. They  pulled ahead early in today's play, and led by 40 with 96 deals of 128  completed.</p>
        <p>Both teams played superbly throughout the two-week competition. The Polish players, who defeated the United States in Thursday's semifinal, are Cezary Balicky, Adam Zmudzinski, Jacek Pszczola, Machal Kwiecien, Piotr Tuszynski and Krzysztof Jassem.</p>
        <p>The United States took third place, defeating England by 67 in the playoff between losing semifinalists.</p>
        <p>When a Polish pair bid to a grand slam that failed unluckily against the Italians, a commentator remarked that although the pope is Polish, God is an Italian.</p>
        <p>In the Vugraph theater. Balicki and Zmudzinski, North and South for Poland, bid confidently to seven spades as shown.</p>
        <p>The Polish Club opening was forcing, although not necessarily strong. Balicki was delighted to hear his partner's positive response of one spade, and his jump to four clubs over the two-diamond overcall was a splinter, indicating a spade fit, club shortness and slam interest. When his partner showed diamond control, he was able to ask for aces and bid the grand slam.</p>
        <p>It would have been easy to make the grand slam with normal splits, but the gods of the game had decreed that both major suits would break badly.</p>
        <p>Zmudzinski won the opening diamond lead with the ace and led to the spade ace. That was the first blow. He then played three top hearts, hoping to discard two diamonds from his hand and maneuver a diamond ruff. But East ruffed the third heart, which was the second blow. There was now no way to make the grand slam.</p>
        <p>The third blow came later, when South discovered that Bocchi and Duboin had cautiously come to rest in six spades. Again the lead was a  diamond, which was necessary to defeat the grand slam; it removed a crucial entry to the South hand.</p>
        <p>After a black-suit lead, the big slam can be made. The declarer can arrange to ruff clubs in the North hand and eventually squeeze West in the red suits.</p>
        <p>The deal cost Zmudzinski's team  14 imps.</p>
