        <p>A truckers' strike protesting the rising cost of fuel, which had begun to cripple supplies around the country, seemed to lose some of its momentum today when the leader of France's largest truckers' group urged its members to lift their blockades at more than 90 of the country's major fuel depots.</p>
        <p>But many truckers, perhaps encouraged by a poll that suggested that more than 80 percent of the country supported them, appeared to defy their leader. And a smaller union said its members would continue the protest as well.</p>

        <p>A truckers' strike protesting the rising cost of fuel, which had begun to cripple supplies around the country, seemed to lose some of its momentum today when the leader of France's largest truckers' group urged its members to lift their blockades at more than 90 of the country's major fuel depots.</p>
        <p>But many truckers, perhaps encouraged by a poll that suggested that more than 80 percent of the country supported them, appeared to defy their leader. And a smaller union said its members would continue the protest as well.</p>
        <p>The truckers want a 20 percent cut in diesel fuel taxes for freight trucks and have been joined by workers from many other sectors of the economy who have been squeezed by the increasing cost of fuel in the last year.</p>
        <p>The strike has presented Prime Minister Lionel Jospin with a difficult political problem. On Wednesday he cut off negotiations with the unions when his offer of a 15 percent cut in taxes was rejected. Late today, he met with several of his cabinet ministers to discuss the next steps to take.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists in his coalition have already criticized the 15 percent tax cut he offered.</p>
