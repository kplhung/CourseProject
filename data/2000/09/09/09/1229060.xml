        <p>A STATUE it may be, but not a statue of limitations. This is the large bronze representation of Frank Sinatra that the Giuliani administration, in concert with the Sinatra family, hopes to put in the heart of Times Square.</p>
        <p>It seems that Nancy Sinatra badly wants this honor for her father, the incomparable singer and better-than-fair actor, who died two years ago. Ms. Sinatra even promises to pay for the job. One thing is essential to the family: the statue must stand on a traffic island at Broadway and West 44th Street, opposite the site of the old Paramount Theater, where Sinatra thrilled 1940's bobby-soxers and gave rise to the legend of Ol' Blue Eyes.</p>

        <p>A STATUE it may be, but not a statue of limitations. This is the large bronze representation of Frank Sinatra that the Giuliani administration, in concert with the Sinatra family, hopes to put in the heart of Times Square.</p>
        <p>It seems that Nancy Sinatra badly wants this honor for her father, the incomparable singer and better-than-fair actor, who died two years ago. Ms. Sinatra even promises to pay for the job. One thing is essential to the family: the statue must stand on a traffic island at Broadway and West 44th Street, opposite the site of the old Paramount Theater, where Sinatra thrilled 1940's bobby-soxers and gave rise to the legend of Ol' Blue Eyes.</p>
        <p>Great, says City Hall. In its usual fashion, best summed up by the Sinatra song ''All or Nothing at All,'' it has made the project its own and is pushing it through the city bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>And what, you may wonder, is the problem with this? Is not a daughter's devotion worth a price above rubies? Can anyone deny Sinatra's iconic status?</p>
        <p>On that score, you will get no argument here. The singer's fervent fans include this fellow, who has spent many hours at the piano running through the ''Frank Sinatra Songbook.'' Truth be told, some of that time probably should have been spent working. Call me irresponsible.</p>
        <p>But the proposed Sinatra statue does raise serious questions about limitations and the use of public space for private purposes.</p>
        <p>The same issue came up last week with the unveiling of a statue of Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden, the lovable, bus-driving schlemiel from the ''Honeymooners'' television series. That sculpture stands outside the Eighth Avenue entrance to the Port Authority Bus Terminal.</p>
        <p>On the surface, it all seems innocent enough. Hey there, Ralphie boy. Har-dee-har-har, and all that.</p>
        <p>But if you look at the inscription at the statue's base, you will notice that it says, ''Presented by the people of TV Land.'' And what is TV Land? A Viacom cable television channel that carries reruns of the 1950's series.</p>
        <p>In other words, this monument taking up precious space on a New York sidewalk is really a commercial for a big media company.</p>
        <p>The commercial potential of the Sinatra statue may be less obvious, but the basic issue is the same. Here you have a family with money, fame and influence, in effect being allowed to snatch up premier space in this city's central square for its own glory.</p>
        <p>''Every inch of public space is under assault,'' said Kent Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society. ''It's forever being encroached upon.''</p>
        <p>His point would seem hard to dispute. In recent years, the sides of buildings have often become little more than convenient spots for advertisements. Trucks that are essentially billboards on wheels are allowed to cruise the streets and pollute the air. Offer the city enough cash and you can sponsor a concert in Central Park, with your name slapped all over the place. If you happen to be Disney, the city streets are yours for a self-promotional parade.</p>
        <p>THE plans for the Sinatra statue have dispirited Times Square community groups. Their objections, rehashed with City Hall several weeks ago, include concerns about extra crowding on sidewalks that are already jam-packed. Some also doubt that Sinatra is right for that spot of honor. After all, his links to Broadway are slender. He made his mark west of the Hudson. As for those glory days at the Paramount, you might as well erect a statue of the Beatles outside Shea Stadium. They made a huge splash there in the 60's.</p>
        <p>''It feels a little tacky for a family to propose a statue to itself in Times Square,'' said one civic leader in the neighborhood, whose request for anonymity will be honored. Rudolph W. Giuliani may seem a gentler soul these days, but his capacity for vengeance still inspires fear.</p>
        <p>Perhaps that is why the anti-statue forces have avoided delicate points mentioned by some others, like the fact that Sinatra famously avoided the draft during World War II; if approved, his statue would share an island with the Armed Forces Recruiting Station. He was known, too, for hanging out with gangsters, something that perhaps ought to arch an eyebrow on the mob-fighting mayor.</p>
        <p>But some critics suspect that for all their objections, the project is a done deal. They can almost hear Nancy Sinatra, who once teamed with her old man for a song called ''Something Stupid,'' breaking out now in a chorus of ''They Can't Take That Away From Me.''</p>
