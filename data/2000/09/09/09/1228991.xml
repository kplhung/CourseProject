        <p>Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for United States Senate, agreed today to appear with Representative Bob Franks, his Republican opponent, in three televised debates in October, including two on major network affiliates.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Franks said he had accepted the same invitations but angrily attacked Mr. Corzine for rejecting many more debate proposals from news outlets and civic groups across New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's aides, meanwhile, said three debates were plenty.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued today, Mr. Corzine said he was ''happy to have the debate about debates behind us.'' But it seemed unlikely that Mr. Franks would let the issue die any time soon.</p>
        <p>Since the June primaries, Mr. Franks, who is struggling to raise the money to mount an effective television advertising campaign, has called for debates with Mr. Corzine in all 21 counties in the state, much like Vice President Al Gore's call for a twice-weekly schedule of showdowns with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the presidential contest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who like Mr. Bush is seen as having more to lose in such encounters, has resisted them throughout his run for the Senate. During the primary campaign against former Gov. Jim Florio, Mr. Corzine refused to debate on any network television stations, while spending more than $12 million on commercials. He began running his first TV commercials of the general election campaign on Monday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's aides said there was ample precedent for three or fewer debates. In New Jersey governor's races, candidates who accept public financing must agree to three televised debates. And in the 1996 Senate race between Robert G. Torricelli and Richard A. Zimmer, there were only two.</p>
        <p>But Charlie Smith, Mr. Franks's campaign manager, said Mr. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, was a special case. ''Dick Zimmer and Bob Torricelli were both congressmen who'd had long public records,'' he said. ''Jon Corzine has no public record other than his spotty voting record. He's a newcomer to the business of politics who needs to demonstrate his experience and grasp of the issues. He should want to do that for voters. The voters deserve that opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's aides said he planned to prove himself to voters on his own terms. ''We could be doing 30 debates in addition to these three,'' said Steve DeMicco, one of Mr. Corzine's campaign managers. ''But frankly, engaging every day with Bob Franks is not the way that we've chosen to run this campaign.''</p>
        <p>''We're not interested in a tactical dance with Bob Franks day in and day out,'' Mr. DeMicco said. ''Debates have their limitations. What we're interested in is that voters can choose to learn something about the candidates on the issues and in a constructive dialogue. Candidates can get into a dialogue with the voters, or they can tangle with their opponents.''</p>
        <p>New Jersey is divided into two major media markets. The first of the three hourlong debates would be telecast on Oct. 1 or 8 on WCBS-TV in New York and KYW-TV in Philadelphia, and would be co-sponsored by The Star-Ledger of Newark.</p>
        <p>The second debate, which has not yet been scheduled, would be co-sponsored by The New York Times and shown on the New Jersey Network, a statewide public television system. The final debate would be shown on Oct. 22 on WABC-TV in New York and WPVI-TV, the ABC affiliate in Philadelphia, and co-sponsored by The Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>
