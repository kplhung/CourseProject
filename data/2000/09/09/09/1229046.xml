        <p>The outcome of the game boosted the Yankees' division lead over Boston to a season-high seven games and left the Red Sox two games behind the Cleveland Indians, who also lost, in the wild-card chase. Excuse the Red Sox if those races were not the prevalent thought in their minds.</p>
        <p>''It puts things in perspective,'' Lou Merloni, the Red Sox third baseman, said after his team's 4-0 loss to Roger Clemens last night. ''You've got two teams battling down the stretch. But something like that happens, it's just a game. It's just a game. You just hope everything comes out all right for him.''</p>
        <p>Merloni was talking -- softly and prayerfully -- about his teammate  Bryce Florie, a relief pitcher, who was hit in the face by a Ryan Thompson line drive in the ninth inning. The sound of the collision of baseball with face jarred those who heard it.</p>
        <p>''It's not a good feeling,'' said Merloni, who instinctively fielded the ball and threw out Thompson. ''I've never seen something like that up close. The sound I heard from third base, it's not a good feeling. It was something I'd never seen and I don't want to see again.''</p>
        <p>Thompson was so stunned by the sight and sound that he momentarily forgot to run to first.</p>
        <p>''It sounded like someone stepped on glass,'' the reserve outfielder said. ''It wasn't a pretty sound.''</p>
        <p>After he belatedly ran and was out, Thompson stopped briefly at the mound, where Florie lay, and asked the Red Sox trainers to tell Florie he was sorry. ''I know they say you're not supposed to say sorry in baseball,'' he said later, ''but this is about life and family.''</p>
        <p>The ball smacked into the cheekbone just below Florie's right eye. It instantly knocked him to the ground and bloodied his face. ''There was blood everywhere,'' Joe Kerrigan, the Boston pitching coach, said.</p>
        <p>But Florie remained conscious. ''He knew exactly what was going on around him,'' Merloni said.</p>
        <p>The 30-year-old right-hander was taken to Massachusetts Eye and Ear at Massachusetts General Hospital, but the Red Sox did not get an immediate report on the damage the ball did.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, Clemens in particular, had already done damage to the Red Sox, who have only 24 games in which to claw their way into the playoffs. Clemens shut them down on five hits in eight innings as he continued the first-rate pitching he has provided since returning from a brief stay on the disabled list in June.</p>
        <p>In 14 starts before his groin injury, Clemens had a 4-6 record with a 4.76 earned run average and 84 hits allowed in 811/3  innings. In 14 starts since, he has an 8-0 record and a 2.25 E.R.A. with 74 hits allowed in 100 innings.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to make a living doing it,'' Merloni said about hitting against Clemens. ''He threw the ball outstanding. He seemed to get all the life to his fastball back. He was throwing the ball hard.''</p>
        <p>Jimy Williams had a simple question. ''How old is he?'' Williams, the Red Sox manager, asked, then said, ''I don't think he lost any of his juice in the eighth.''</p>
        <p>Merloni, who was hitting .354 in 18 games with Boston and was coming off his fourth three-hit game, lashed a triple in his first at-bat, then struck out in the fifth and seventh innings with runners on base.</p>
        <p>''The first one he just gave me a fastball, just came at me,'' Merloni said. ''I got a jump on the first pitch. After that he threw that hard split and it's tough to lay off. We had a few situations where we could have gotten some runs on him. But he's a good pitcher, a strikeout pitcher. He got strikeouts when he needed them.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, Merloni had recalled his boyhood when he was growing up in nearby Framingham. He did what every other young New England boy did. He played fantasy baseball in the backyard, and his team was always the good guys.</p>
        <p>''When you're a kid and you're out there playing ball, one team is always the Yankees, one team is always the Red Sox,'' he said. ''The Red Sox always won. Of course, of course, they always won.''</p>
        <p>And the winning pitcher? ''Somebody was always Roger Clemens,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nothing, then, really has changed, except Clemens's uniform.</p>
        <p>Nothing has changed either about the Red Sox status in the postseason picture. Even with three games left with the Yankees, beginning today with Pedro Martinez pitching for them, the Red Sox are as good as dead in the division race. The wild-card spot is more viable for the team that was the A.L. wild-card entry the previous two seasons.</p>
        <p>Asked after the game about the races, Williams said: ''The races? We got a game here at 1 o'clock tomorrow. That's what we're looking forward to.''</p>
        <p>And then he quickly added what was on the minds of everyone in the subdued Boston clubhouse. ''Hopefully, Bryce is O.K.,'' he said. ''That's more important than the game.''</p>
