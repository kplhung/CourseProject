        <p>International Federation of Secular Humanistic Jews holds conference in New York City in support of its view that one can affirm values and culture of Judaism without belief in God; speakers include poet Robert Pinsky and film director Lawrence Kasdan; federation leaders, Myrna Baron and Felix Posen, cite concern that many people are unaware of opportunities to join secularist communities (M)</p>

        <p>Health care, education and the military have all been -- not surprisingly -- major topics in the presidential campaign. But so has personal religious belief.</p>
        <p>Certainly, comments by the candidates have made it seem so, as when Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee, said that belief in Jesus had changed his life, and when Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, talked about the value of religious belief in public life.</p>
        <p>It has made some defenders of the separation of church and state uneasy. And a couple have even worried that the talk about faith leaves nonbelievers feeling like outsiders. According to the polls, this is not a small group in a nation of more than 270 million. At least 5 percent of Americans claim no belief in a deity; nearly three times that number said they had no religious preference or affiliation.</p>
        <p>But their presence is not always obvious -- unless, that is, an organized group shows up, like several hundred secular humanists who have come to New York this weekend for a conference declaring that one can affirm values and culture that originated in a particular religion, in this case Judaism, without having a need to believe in God.</p>
        <p>The conference is the International Federation of Secular Humanistic Jews, an association of organizations in Europe, Israel, North and South America and Australia. The federation, which said it has 50,000 members worldwide, recently established a headquarters in New York.</p>
        <p>The New York event began last night at Cooper Union, with speakers that included the poet laureate Robert Pinsky and the film director Lawrence Kasdan.</p>
        <p>In an interview before the conference, two of the federation's leaders voiced concern that some who might want to belong to a community of secularists (just as religious believers might want to join a church or synagogue) might be unaware that such opportunities exist.</p>
        <p>''I think many people don't know that there's a place to go,'' said Myrna Baron, the federation's new executive director and a founder of the City Congregation for Humanistic Judaism in New York. The word ''humanism,'' Ms. Baron said, does not translate into all languages (modern Hebrew being one of them) but in her experience, those who call themselves humanistic Jews share an interest in human dignity, human rights and the study of a Jewish heritage that emphasizes its human contributions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Baron was accompanied by Felix Posen, a chairman of the federation who lives in Britain.</p>
        <p>''What we're interested in is to give the extra option,'' Mr. Posen said. By that, he said, he meant a Jewish identity distinct from that offered by religious organizations. The constituency of the secular communities, he said, would be those who agreed with a phrase he attributed to the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin: ''I'm tone-deaf as far as God is concerned.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Baron had a copy of Sh'ma, an independent journal of Jewish opinion that devoted its June issue to the subject, with articles by Rabbi Sherwin T. Wine, founder of the federation and the humanistic Jewish movement in the United States, and Yehuda Bauer, an Israeli scholar of the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>''Our movement is secular because its focus is on the pleasures and pains of this world,'' Rabbi Wine wrote. ''It is humanistic because it finds the source of power for solving problems in human beings and because it sees the meaning of Jewish history in the Jewish defiance of an unjust world.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bauer wrote that for him, God's existence after the Holocaust, in which 1.5 million children were killed, was ''impossible from a moral point of view.''</p>
        <p>The journal also provided space for theological replies.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Marcia Prager, an official of a Jewish renewal organization, wrote that one could draw a lesson from the mystical teachings of Jewish Cabala: ''It is perhaps the ultimate testimony to the magnificence of the Divine love that God is willing to create and sustain a universe in which God's own presence is hidden, in which God's own existence can be denied, in which God can be abandoned.''</p>
        <p>And Rabbi David A. Teutsch, president of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, wrote: ''When we do not feel the presence of the Divine, living Torah keeps God present nonetheless.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Posen said that he and others in the federation hoped to develop educational materials for children and adults who want to study Judaism as culture rather than religion.</p>
        <p>''I'm starting a huge literary project of cultural Judaism,'' Mr. Posen said, citing one such project. He said the work already had scholarly advisers.</p>
        <p>''We will divide history into seven or eight periods, starting with the Torah,'' he said. The project will cover the modern era, so that much of its attention will be on recent Jewish cultural contributions. Placing his palms about two feet apart to indicate several volumes, Mr. Posen said, ''If it is this size, more than half of it will be the last 150 years.''</p>
