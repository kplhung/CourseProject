        <p>In an early first act to the new term that begins next month, the Supreme Court agreed today to resolve a growing dispute over federal court review of state criminal convictions.</p>
        <p>The question is whether federal prisoners can seek federal court review when the prior convictions are the reason the prisoner has been sentenced to extra time as a repeat offender.</p>
        <p>Although the question seems technical and arcane, it has grown in importance as federal sentencing has increasingly taken into account an offender's criminal past. There has been a recent spate of divergent federal appeals court rulings on whether the validity of earlier state court convictions can be challenged in federal court once the enhanced federal sentence has been imposed.</p>
        <p>Appeals from two of those opposite rulings were awaiting Supreme Court action, and the Justice Department told the justices that a prompt resolution was ''important to the stability of federal sentences.''</p>
        <p>The court today accepted an appeal by a California man who was convicted of violating a federal law that makes it a crime for a felon to possess a gun. He was then sentenced under a separate federal statute, the Armed Career Criminal Act, which imposes a minimum 15-year sentence for the gun violation on anyone who has three previous serious felony convictions. The effect was a doubling of the sentence for the defendant, Earthy D. Daniels Jr.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniels had four previous convictions in the California courts that met the definition. After his federal sentencing, he filed a motion in federal court to vacate his sentence on the ground that two of the earlier convictions, both for robbery, were constitutionally invalid because of improperly obtained guilty pleas and inadequate legal advice. He made his motion under a federal law, Section 2255, which authorizes federal inmates to seek correction of erroneous sentences.</p>
        <p>The Federal District Court in Los Angeles denied the motion, as did the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. Both courts acted on the basis of their interpretation of a 1994 Supreme Court decision, Custis v. United States, which held that federal defendants could not challenge the validity of prior state convictions at their federal sentencing hearing. The Ninth Circuit went further and held that challenges also could not be brought after the sentence was final.</p>
        <p>Whether the Custis decision was limited to the sentencing proceeding, or acted as a complete bar to later review of state court convictions, is the issue that has divided the federal circuits because the Supreme Court in the 1994 case did not address the question. Almost simultaneously with the Ninth Circuit's decision in Mr. Daniels's case, Daniels v. United States, No. 99-9136, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, read the earlier decision differently to permit a challenge under Section 2255 of a federal inmate's three 10-year-old drug convictions. The Justice Department has appealed that ruling, United States v. Clark, No. 00-122.</p>
        <p>The court gave no indication today why it acted in advance of its usual starting date to add the Daniels case.</p>
        <p>There had been some speculation that the justices might act today in the Microsoft antitrust case, in which the court must decide whether to hear the company's appeal or let the case be heard first by the federal appeals court here. But there was no word today, although the case is ready for the justices' action. The next possible date for an order in the Microsoft case is Sept. 26.</p>
