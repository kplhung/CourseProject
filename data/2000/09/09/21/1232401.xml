        <p>Ask people in this lonely little city, so far north that it is practically part of Canada, and they will tell you that the one thing their town needs is a highway.</p>
        <p>Ask the mayor, ask businessmen, ask union guys, and they will start lobbying for a four-lane to connect them to the rest of the state, so they can attract new businesses (and new people; it seems as if most everyone who lives in Ogdensburg was born there).</p>
        <p>Ask Eyal Shapira about a highway, however, and he snorts: ''Not in my lifetime.'' Rattling off the hurdles, from environmental to political to financial, he concludes: ''I drove from Plattsburgh to Ogdensburg, 120 miles, and saw 50 cars in a two-and-a-half-hour drive. You don't need a four-lane highway for 50 cars.''</p>
        <p>Given that Mr. Shapira is now the operator of the local freight railroad, his speech -- which he delivers at high speed and with a marked Israeli accent -- is perhaps not surprising.</p>
        <p>What is fairly astonishing, both to him and to the locals, is that Eyal Shapira, from Tel Aviv via Boston, is also in charge of luring companies and jobs to Ogdensburg. For the last six months he has been the area's industrial recruiter, hired by local governments, which means he basically works for all those folks who are pushing for the highway.</p>
        <p>Like many communities upstate, Ogdensburg has been getting by economically because of prisons, of which it has two, both New York State medium-security prisons. It also has plenty of low-wage jobs that pay $8 an hour, according to John C. Krol, the city manager. ''Many people here need to work two jobs to make ends meet,'' he said. ''We desperately need some more higher paying jobs, but they're very hard to get.'' Enter Mr. Shapira.</p>
        <p>''Culture clash'' only hints at the contrast between Mr. Shapira, with his red Jeep and cell phone, and the low-key residents of Ogdensburg, which modestly bills itself as ''one of New York State's best-kept secrets.'' People here are so polite and friendly that they say ''Hi!'' on the street to strangers (possibly they don't see many). Mr. Shapira's preferred form of greeting appears to be ''Darling!''</p>
        <p>But how and why he got to Ogdensburg tells a lot about this remote place. Indeed, his very presence is perhaps the boldest step yet that Ogdensburg has taken to bring itself into the 21st century and tap into the economic boom that has buoyed New York City and its suburbs.</p>
        <p>While this is by no means the worst of times for Ogdensburg and its fellow towns in the North Country, the economy isn't exactly sizzling, either. In all of St. Lawrence County, an enormous swath of land that includes just 113,000 people (including Ogdensburg's 13,000), only 200 new jobs have been added in the last year, an increase of 0.5 percent; the statewide average is 1.4 percent. The county unemployment rate is 5.8 percent, the highest of any area outside  New York City.</p>
        <p>Given its history, Ogdensburg could be forgiven for being leery of outsiders, going back to the War of 1812. British Redcoats crossed the St. Lawrence River and captured the city (not, it must be said, without provocation). Then there were all those promises about what a boon the St. Lawrence Seaway would be after it opened in 1959. ''It basically turned out to be a superhighway from Chicago and Duluth to Montreal or Europe,'' said Mr. Krol, the city manager. ''Very few ships stopped here.''</p>
        <p>Worst of all, perhaps, was the time in the 1970's when consultants from New York City persuaded the town fathers to raze their old-fashioned downtown and build a low-slung shopping center surrounded by parking lots. It was not a success, and the city lost some of its charm, though it did gain some remarkable views of the river.</p>
        <p>The extraordinary light and landscape of the St. Lawrence was a favorite non-Western subject of Frederic Remington, the painter and sculptor, who lived here in his youth; a museum dedicated to his works attracts flocks of Texans in boots and big cars during the summer months. And the city has other cultural attractions -- on Sept. 26, a professional orchestra and chorus will perform the works of Andrew Lloyd Weber.</p>
        <p>This tidy city has retained many of its old-fashioned virtues, like neighborliness and very hard work. ''As you arrive in Ogdensburg, you are going back in time,'' said Steve deJaray, chairman of Aim Global Technologies in Ottawa, which several years ago bought a plant here to assemble complex electronic equipment and is hiring more workers.</p>
        <p>The area has long taken advantage of its proximity to Canada, though the economic links have been strained by the decline of the Canadian dollar and the transformation of North America into one big free-trade zone. Back when the Canadian dollar was strong compared with the American greenback, shoppers surged south over the soaring Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge.</p>
        <p>William D. Nelson, a 40-year-old hospital administrator and since January the city's mayor, said that he and his family often hop in their boat and zoom across the river to Canada for dinner. And the easiest way to get from New York City to Ogdensburg is to fly to Ottawa and drive south for about an hour. Ogdensburg does have an airport, but the puddle-jumpers that serve it fly out of Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Perhaps through necessity, Ogdensburg has also made something of a virtue out of its isolation from the rest of New York State. For more than a century, it has been the home of the state-run St. Lawrence Psychiatric Center, a huge clutch of stone-and-brick buildings with steep roofs and wide verandas, which are now mostly vacant. As such institutions for the mentally ill fell out of favor, the center's jobs dwindled, and efforts to sell the property have not come to anything.</p>
        <p>The best jobs in town are at the prisons, where correctional officers make an average of $40,000 a year, plus benefits. Michelle Snye and her husband both teach horticulture to inmates, jobs that allow the Snyes to stay in the region where they grew up.</p>
        <p>''The economy here is not doing as well as in New York City and other places,'' said Mrs. Snye, 48. If it weren't for the prisons, she added, ''I'd be looking for work somewhere else.''</p>
        <p>Praise for the prison jobs propels Mr. Shapira into full rant. ''Any time you see more than one prison in a community, you know people gave up,'' he said, gradually gaining speed. ''Where I come from, we want our kids to go to Harvard, Yale, Brown. Nobody ever wants their kids to grow up to work in a prison. These are the most lucrative jobs? God help me, what's wrong with these people?''</p>
        <p>The locals don't see it that way. Richard G. Lockwood was mayor of Ogdensburg for two decades before retiring last December. He is also a longtime schoolteacher who still buttonholes former students to urge them to attend college. He was the one who persuaded the state to put the first prison in Ogdensburg in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>''Some would argue that two prisons shouldn't be a feather in your cap,'' he said. ''It was a stopgap,''  back when his hometown was reeling from cutbacks at the psychiatric center. To make matters worse, the biggest private employer, Diamond International, a paper products company, closed its pulp plant in 1978, and efforts to reopen it kept foundering (it is now being demolished).</p>
        <p>''The psychiatric center was the lifeblood of this community,'' Mr. Lockwood said. ''And if you didn't have someone working there, you had someone at Diamond. Then they were both gone.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Shapira, Mr. Lockwood has his reservations, as do others in Ogdensburg. ''I don't agree with Eyal's image of this part of the world,'' he said. ''His whole thing is, you can't do business by being nice. But I think you catch more flies with honey.'' (Mr. Lockwood is a beekeeper.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Shapira also has his supporters. Mayor Nelson calls him a go-getter. Charles W. Kelly, the editor of the local newspaper, The Ogdensburg Journal, who is known universally as Chuck, is also a backer of Mr. Shapira's, as well as a driving force behind the committee to get that highway built. In addition to finding Mr. Shapira something of a hoot, he also appreciates the fact that ''he's really trying to promote Ogdensburg, and that's what we need.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly, who was born and raised here as one of 10 children, knows it is not the easiest place to be an outsider. ''The joke is that you are not an acknowledged resident till you've been here 40 years,'' he said. ''We kid people that after 25 years, you can start voting if you want to.''</p>
        <p>This is not news to Mr. Shapira. ''Unfortunately, I will never be part of the community,'' he said. ''I will always be an outsider.''</p>
        <p>Just being Jewish sets him apart in Ogdensburg, not to mention the accent. He came to this country in 1977 to visit his now ex-wife, Mr. Shapira said, and got into residential real estate around Boston. In 1990, he began to specialize in railroad-related real estate projects.</p>
        <p>About three years ago, he said, the Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority, which is the chief economic development agency here, approached him about operating its freight railroad, which connects the city's port  to CSX Transportation's web of freight rails.</p>
        <p>And though he had never operated a rail line, had never even played with Lionels as a boy, Mr. Shapira said, ''Lo and behold, I own a railroad,'' the New York and Ogdensburg Railway Company. It was not much of a railroad; two years ago, it ran just once a week. In mid-September, Mr. Shapira said, it started running six days out of seven.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Shapira has big plans. He says he has persuaded several large plastics companies to ship resins by rail to Ogdensburg, where the material will be transferred to trucks and sent to Canada. He hopes that eventually companies that use plastics will set up plants here. The railroad will also get more business next year, when a new plant making wood paneling opens right outside of Ogdensburg.</p>
        <p>''He's gaining ground,'' said Danny L. Duprey, executive director of the port authority.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Shapira began working on the railroad, Mr. Duprey was wrestling with another problem. He wanted to hire an outsider to help with economic development, someone with a fresh approach. But he wanted to pay that person only if there were tangible results, just as one would pay a real estate broker.</p>
        <p>''Who's doing that? Nobody,'' he said. ''And nobody would do it as a hired gun.'' Nobody, that is, except Mr. Shapira.</p>
        <p>So six months ago, he got the job, representing the port authority, Ogdensburg and two other little towns. He gets $1,000 a month for his expenses, and a bonus for every job he actually brings in.</p>
        <p>Though he thinks Mr. Shapira's efforts have been positive, Mr. Duprey added, ''the verdict is still out'' on whether his contract will be renewed in March.</p>
        <p>The fit is clearly not ideal. With his very hard sell, Mr. Shapira sometimes comes off as ''the consummate used-car salesman,'' Mr. Duprey said, and because he doesn't have roots in the area, he misses some of the subtleties.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Shapira says he wants to improve the quality of life in Ogdensburg so people can afford to send their children to private schools. (Never mind that the public school and its Blue Devils teams are the city's pride and joy.) And he doesn't endear himself locally with remarks like, ''We cannot convert Ogdensburg into Pittsburgh overnight.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Shapira shrugs off criticism that he is too aggressive. ''My style works for most people,'' he said. ''Some people get offended.'' Those who complain ''don't understand the urgency of the problem,'' he added.</p>
        <p>''It's not only the railroad,'' he said. ''I have become a geography teacher. I must educate everyone in the entire U.S. where is Ogdensburg.''</p>
        <p>The Other Economy</p>
        <p>Upstate New York, a vast, diverse landscape of old cities, small towns, farms and forests stretching from Buffalo to Albany and north to the Canadian border, was once one of the most populous and prosperous regions of the country. But the national economic boom that swept into New York City and its suburbs passed it by.</p>
        <p>This is the sixth article of a series that began April 9 examining the region's quest for prosperity.</p>
