        <p>A familiar cacophony echoes in the school's peeling cement halls, just regular youngsters letting off steam during a break between classes. The boys are in tracksuits and Nikes, the giggly preteenage girls in Hello Kitty T-shirts and platform shoes.</p>
        <p>But somewhere in the background is the high-pitched sawing of a jinghu, an ancient Chinese string instrument. And no one seems to take much notice when a creature with a bleached white face splotched with brilliant colors carrying a sword rounds a bend in the stairs.</p>
        <p>These are ordinary children studying a most rarefied pursuit: they come from across China to a specialized middle school here in the hopes of becoming future Beijing opera stars. And in many ways these giggly pupils and their teachers form a fragile lifeline for a dying art that is the centerpiece of traditional Chinese culture.</p>
        <p>''In the old days everyone knew Beijing opera, and learning how to sing it was popular, but then there were no movies or home karaoke sets or VCD's,'' or video compact disks, said Li Xiaofeng, vice dean of the Accessory Intermediate School of the China Theatrical College, herself a former performer. ''As China has opened up, our cultural life has become so much richer -- plays, Western opera, art -- but that means that Beijing opera doesn't monopolize the stage as it once did.''</p>
        <p>With its complex stories sung in high whiny voices, crashing cymbals and highly stylized movements, Beijing opera is not an easy art form for the uninitiated to love. Even in its heyday many of the plotlines were only known to well-educated Chinese.</p>
        <p>Not so long ago every city in China was obliged to have an opera troupe if only as a symbol of local pride, the cultural equivalent of small countries boasting an airline.</p>
        <p>Today there are fewer than 60 troupes nationwide, and some provinces don't have any. Though Beijing opera performances are still presented around the capital, most fans are well-educated retirees. China's younger generation is far more attuned to the N.B.A. and MTV.</p>
        <p>And that presents a big problem for Beijing opera, since government support for the art form has dropped steeply as China's planned economy has given way to market forces. Troupes must now, for the first time, attract a paying audience to survive and often train their own performers.</p>
        <p>''With our reforms brought to bear on Beijing opera troupes, many get little financing from the government,'' said Li Hong, a division chief at the Ministry of Culture. ''They have to feed themselves by doing performances or finding sponsors.''</p>
        <p>For the Intermediate School of the Theatrical College, China's new market economy has meant large changes. Tuition-free until the mid-1990's, the school is now forced to charge about $600 a year in school fees, far more than the average Chinese public school fees and many times the average Chinese monthly income.</p>
        <p>Since Chinese teenagers are today far more apt to seek a career with I.B.M. or a punk-rock band, big opera troupes must recruit so that new performers will keep coming into the pipeline. Beijing opera is one of the world's most demanding art forms, with singing, dance, acrobatics, martial arts, drama. Successful stars combine the skills of a Luciano Pavarotti and a Nadia Comenici, and training almost always starts young.</p>
        <p>The troupes have become far more aggressive in hunting down students, holding contests in major cities, for example. They have also gotten into fund-raising, soliciting private businessmen to set up scholarships.</p>
        <p>Wang Shimeng, a lanky 12-year-old in a sky blue track suit and Donald Duck baseball cap, said that two years ago he had signed up for a tryout in his hometown, Harbin.</p>
        <p>''My parents are opera lovers,'' he said during a break from acrobatics class, as 30 boys flipped wildly onto foam mats in the background. He hopes someday to be a star, although for now he likes to play soccer and watch cartoons.</p>
        <p>The school has worked hard to introduce young Chinese to Beijing opera by developing ''greatest hit'' shows. Every two weeks Shimeng and his classmates perform in a local theater, and Ms. Li is trying to take shows to Beijing's colleges and schools.</p>
        <p>''There hasn't been enough promotion, so we go out to lecture and to popularize Beijing opera so people will understand what it's about,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Li acknowledged that for now, at least, the opera troupes could not continue their performance schedule without the government financing that remains, about $500,000 a year. With their fantastic sets and elaborate costume, Beijing operas are expensive to develop and stage.</p>
        <p>''If the government decided to totally let us live or die on our own, it would be very difficult for us,'' said Ms. Li. ''I don't think it would die out, but its influence would certainly shrink even further.''</p>
        <p>To help its students can navigate an uncertain future, the opera school  insists that all take academic courses and has added university and master-level opera programs. Its students seem at home in both the old-world China and the new.</p>
        <p>''Beijing opera is a national treasure, and I think most of my friends envy me, that I'm here,'' said Song Yang, a 12-year-old from Beijing in a fashionable white jacket, sunglasses and platform shoes. But when she and her classmates were asked to pick their favorite music, they giggled and confessed allegiance to a Hong Kong singer. ''I love pop music, especially Wang Fei,'' she said.</p>
