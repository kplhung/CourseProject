        <p>Barbara Walters To Stay at ABC</p>
        <p>Last spring, with her contract due to expire and no new deal completed, BARBARA WALTERS, the ABC News personality, had dinner with ANDREW HEYWARD, the president of CBS News, the one network news division for which she had never worked. (She was a co-host of ''Today'' on NBC before she left in 1976 for a million-dollar salary and a co-anchor's chair on ABC's evening newscast.)</p>
        <p>Word of the encounter with Mr. Heyward prompted speculation in the television news industry that Ms. Walters was entertaining an offer from CBS. But sometimes, a meal is just a meal.</p>
        <p>ABC News announced yesterday that Ms. Walters, 68, had signed a new contract and will remain at ABC for the next five years. Her duties will basically remain unchanged. The network said she would continue to be anchor of ''20/20 Friday'' and produce her ''Barbara Walters Specials.'' Under the agreement, Ms. Walters would be the host of two such programs a year, with one focusing on the Academy Awards.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of a separate contract with ABC, Ms. Walters will continue to produce ''The View,'' the daytime talk show on which she is also a host, for the next five years as well.</p>
        <p>The network did not say how much Ms. Walters would be paid between now and 2005; the network did say that she would not comment.</p>
        <p>A Private Tour Fit for a Prince</p>
        <p>CARRIE BARRATT, the curator who assembled the Metropolitan Museum of Art's new exhibition about Queen Victoria, led a documentary producer on a private tour on Tuesday night: PRINCE EDWARD, Queen Elizabeth's youngest son, who makes documentaries under the name EDWARD WINDSOR.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't worried about what I would say,'' Ms. Barratt said yesterday. ''It's more an American thing, I guess -- I was concerned about meeting a prince. Do you curtsy? Do you bow?''</p>
        <p>She did neither.</p>
        <p>Then there was the question of what to call her visitor. ''One person said call him 'sir,' one said 'Edward.' I can't remember if I called him anything. His demeanor is a poised informality that puts you at rest.''</p>
        <p>Upstaging a Mayor</p>
        <p>Baseball booster that he is, MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI could not resist presiding over a victory celebration at City Hall for the Staten Island Yankees, the single-A farm team of the major league team that calls Yankee Stadium home. The Staten Island Yankees won the national pennant in their division, and yesterday, a handful of players and managers was welcomed at City Hall. They were accompanied by their mascot, a costumed  seven-foot character that looks like Goofy from the Donald Duck cartoons and goes by the name Scooter.</p>
        <p>In less than 15 minutes, Scooter did the impossible: he upstaged the mayor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has spent much of the last year promoting a new minor league stadium for the Staten Island team just west of the St. George Ferry Terminal. Yesterday was no exception: Mr. Giuliani was talking about the importance of the new stadium and the benefits it would bring to baseball-loving New Yorkers on both sides of New York Harbor.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giuliani's remarks were interrupted when Scooter opened his oversized Yankees uniform to reveal a button that read ''Bratton for Mayor.'' This was a curious display, since the mayor has gone out of his way to ridicule the candidacy -- as yet not formally announced -- of WILLIAM J. BRATTON, the former police commissioner.</p>
        <p>The mayor looked surprised and tore the button from Scooter's chest, stowing it under his lectern.</p>
        <p>Then, with a dramatic flourish, Scooter pulled the head off his costume, revealing GUY V. MOLINARI, the Staten Island borough president, wearing a sly grin. A stalwart among New York City Republicans, Mr. Molinari may be alone among the city's elected officials in backing Mr. Bratton, who is expected to switch his voter registration from independent to Republican, and in remaining close enough to Mr. Giuliani to joke around at City Hall.</p>
        <p>Then a reporter asked what kind of animal Scooter represented. The mayor did not hesitate. ''It's a borough president,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Molinari disagreed.  ''No,'' he said, ''it's just a Republican.''</p>
        <p>JAMES BARRON with Jim Rutenberg and Thomas J. Lueck</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 23, 2000, Saturday  A report in the Public Lives column on Thursday about a victory celebration at City Hall for the Staten Island Yankees misstated the reason that Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island borough president, wore a button expressing support for William J. Bratton, the former police commissioner, who is considering a 2001 run for mayor. Mr. Molinari, who was dressed as Scooter, the team's mascot, wore it in jest; he is not supporting Mr. Bratton's candidacy.</p>
