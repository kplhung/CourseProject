        <p>IS it as easy as computer and video camera makers would have you think to edit a home movie on a computer?</p>
        <p>After spending a weekend making a short video of a youth soccer match, I can say that the definitive answer to that question is: yes and no.</p>
        <p>Yes, because video editing software -- I used the iMovie program that comes on Apple's iMac DV -- is simple, intuitive and even fun to use. No, because to assemble anything other than the most basic jumble of scenes requires an amount of skill, and free time, that I (and many other people, I suspect) don't possess.</p>
        <p>With iMovie, raw video is fed into the computer from the camera via a high-speed FireWire cable, then is broken down into individual scenes, which the software calls clips. These can be dragged and dropped into a ''clip viewer'' in the order desired for the final movie. Dissolves or other transitions are easily created, as are titles and other effects. Sounds can be added or subtracted, volume faded in or out.</p>
        <p>Simple, in theory. And iMovie's tutorial, which results in a cute little movie about two children giving a dog a bath, makes it seem simple in practice. The movie has six video clips and shows how to put them together, performing some tricks along the way, like digitally splicing part of one clip into another, adding a music soundtrack and creating scrolling credits.</p>
        <p>But even that 52-second movie takes about an hour to complete (the tutorial itself suggests that it may take up to an hour and a half). And that's with everything -- clips and sound files -- readily at hand.</p>
        <p>My soccer movie, which ended up being 3 minutes, 42 seconds long, took a lot longer to make. And while it's more than a basic jumble of scenes, it's not as polished as the tutorial movie.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest problems cropped up at the beginning of the process, as I was feeding the recorded video from the digital camcorder into the computer (video from older analog camcorders must be converted first). IMovie creates clips automatically, making a new one every time the camera was stopped during recording. While that is convenient, it also quickly revealed the haphazard nature of my camera work. While the tutorial had 6 clips, I ended up with 49, varying in length from two seconds to about a minute and a half. A little planning before and during the shooting would make the whole process easier.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the software makes it simple to delete unwanted clips (employing all the usual Cut, Copy and Paste commands), so in a first go-round I trashed about 30 of them. But that still left me with about 20, and among these, most had unwanted or unusable moments. (For one thing, an uninterrupted 90-second clip of a youth soccer game feels like an eternity when viewed on screen.) So before I could assemble my movie, I first had to edit the clips.</p>
        <p>Again, iMovie makes this easy. Each clip can be displayed and run through at will, and can be quickly cut in two, or desired snippets can be cut and pasted into new clips. The problem, of course, is that the number of clips quickly start to multiply like bacteria. Clip management can become a nightmare. IMovie gives each clip a number, but I found it more convenient to rename them, giving a short description of the action in each.</p>
        <p>Once the clips are edited, though, it's easy to arrange them in the clip viewer in rough form. The clips can also be rearranged at will; different combinations of scenes can be tried until the movie feels right.</p>
        <p>Each rough cut can be run through from start to finish on the program's main display windows. That  quickly revealed further flaws in the clips -- many were too long and needed to be cut (even an uninterrupted 15-second clip of a youth soccer game can feel like an eternity). That, in turn, created still more clips.</p>
        <p>My final movie contained 29 clips, and even after a fair amount of snipping and juggling, I wasn't completely satisfied. Some of the clips were still too long, and while I did the best I could arranging them, they seemed for the most part to be thrown together haphazardly. But I couldn't go on rearranging forever.</p>
        <p>I used transitions six times, with one scene dissolving into the next, or one appearing to push the other off the screen. These were easy to create and gave the finished product a more polished look, helping to disguise some odd cuts. Superimposing a title on one of the opening scenes was also easy to do.</p>
        <p>That left the sound track, which in some ways was even harder to create than the video. IMovie allows the sound to be extracted from a video clip, so if you like the sound somewhere in the raw material but don't like the video, you can take the sound and splice it in somewhere else. It's also easy to add canned sounds or those you record yourself, even right at the computer using the iMac's built-in microphone.</p>
        <p>The problem, as with the video, is that there is soon a profusion of audio clips. These are added to the movie quite simply, by placing them under the video clips. But unlike the video, the audio can't be seen, so it's easy to lose track of which clips are where in the soundtrack. I found that it took a lot of painstaking effort to get the audio clips right where I wanted them.</p>
        <p>Still, about four hours after I sat down at the computer, I had my finished movie, one that immediate family, at least, would find watchable. No doubt the next time things would go much faster, and the finished product would improve. But I doubt that there will be a next time. Movie making is a nice thing to do in theory, but in practice, I have other things to do with my time.</p>
