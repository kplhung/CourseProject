        <p>The Bank of England acknowledged that its Monetary Policy Committee had been narrowly divided this month on holding the benchmark interest rate at 6 percent. The bank said committee members voted 5 to 4 for the second successive month to leave rates unchanged. The closeness of the ballot suggested that the committee could be close to a rate increase if inflation was fueled by the sterling's weakness and high oil prices. The prospect helped to strengthen the pound to $1.4124 from $1.4016 and to 59.92 pence against the euro from 60.38 pence.</p>
