        <p>Pilots at American Airlines overwhelmingly rejected a one-year contract extension yesterday, dealing a blow to the airline's efforts to improve relations with one of its most critical employee groups.</p>
        <p>About 66 percent of the 8,200 pilots who participated in the vote cast ballots against the agreement. The result is a setback for Donald J. Carty, the chief executive of the AMR Corporation, the parent of American, and to Richard T. LaVoy and Brian A. Mayhew, president and vice president of the Allied Pilots Association. All three men had enthusiastically hailed the contract extension, which was announced in July, as the foundation of a new relationship between the airline and the union.</p>
        <p>Past strains between the two sides led pilots to stage an extensive sickout in early 1999, forcing American to cancel 6,700 flights and disrupting travel for tens of thousands of passengers. Two years earlier, the union went on strike but was immediately forced back to work by President Clinton.</p>
        <p>The chances of the agreement's being accepted plunged in late August when pilots at United Airlines, which is the biggest airline in the country, followed by American, negotiated a contract that raised wages as much as 28 percent and greatly increased retirement benefits. Several of the American union's board members who had initially endorsed the agreement changed their minds and urged pilots to vote against it after the United contract was announced.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's result means that the union and the company will begin negotiating a new contract next June, just before the current agreement comes up for renewal. The rejected deal would have extended the contract until Aug. 31, 2002. It also means that American Eagle, American's commuter subsidiary, is restricted to flying just 67 regional jets with 45 seats or more, while other airlines have much more flexibility.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Carty tried to put a positive spin on yesterday's defeat. ''The talks that led to this agreement are proof positive that American and the Allied Pilots Association can work together constructively, and we will continue to work on improving our relationship,'' he said. Last week in New York he told Wall Street analysts that he expected a no vote because of the United contract and that the company would not suffer financially as a result.</p>
        <p>Mr. LaVoy, the union president, was fatalistic. ''You've got to respect the membership's wishes,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''It was never a slam dunk anyway.''</p>
        <p>The deal would have allowed American Eagle to fly hundreds of 50-seat regional jets virtually anywhere in the country. It would also have forced pilots to spend more time flying a single type of jet, like a Boeing 737, before moving up to a bigger aircraft, reducing the airline's training costs.</p>
        <p>In exchange, American pilots were to receive a 3 percent wage increase and the promise that AMR would expand the airline, creating more opportunities for pilots to move up the ranks. The company also agreed to forgive the $45.5 million fine that a federal judge ordered the union to pay the airline as a result of the 1999 sickout. The deal was controversial within the union from the beginning. A group of pilots calling themselves PACE, or Pilots Against Contract Extension, set up a Web site to promote their objections and campaigned hard to defeat the deal.</p>
        <p>The group asserted that the extension was negotiated in secret by Mr. LaVoy and Mr. Mayhew. The two men were also the only individuals named in the $45.5 million fine, leading PACE to question the objectivity of their endorsement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mayhew said yesterday that it was unfortunate that the contempt fine was tied to contractual issues in the extension. But he added that he did not believe that that was decisive because it was clear that the company was always going to forgive the fine. ''It's a matter of when it gets settled, not if it gets settled,'' he said.</p>
