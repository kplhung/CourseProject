        <p>With world and Olympic records rapidly dissolving in the Olympic swimming pool, will there be a ripple effect for divers in the adjacent, deeper pool just a few feet away?</p>
        <p>The United States team's diving coach, Jay Lerew, says it is possible, and his divers say they like the pool.</p>
        <p>''This sort of water feels good to divers,'' Lerew said today, a week before the Games' diving competition begins. ''It has a nice, fluffy feel and you can see a lot better on entries.''</p>
        <p>The pools at the Sydney International Aquatic Center use nearly identical circulation systems, producing remarkably clear water containing few of the harsh chemicals, such as chlorine, that irritate divers. Water quality has been cited by competitors and experts as one reason Olympic swimmers have excelled in the 50-meter swimming pool.</p>
        <p>The diving pool often elicits praise.</p>
        <p>''I love this pool,'' said the United States' Michelle Davison, a 3-meter springboard diver. ''The water is great. The boards are great.''</p>
        <p>The American Troy Dumais, also a 3-meter springboard diver, said he has enjoyed competing in the pool, but added that the center is not perfect. He said that relatively minor drawbacks include fluctuating temperatures in the showers and Jacuzzis, and a cool breeze in the locker room that sometimes chills athletes between dives.</p>
        <p>''But if one person has to deal with it, we all have to deal with it,'' he said. ''It's a great pool.''</p>
        <p>Samaranch Returns</p>
        <p>Less than four days after leaving to be with his dying wife in Spain, the president of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, returned today for the remainder of the Games.</p>
        <p>''I'm very pleased to be back,'' he said. ''I felt I had the responsibility to return as soon as I could. I'm looking forward to seeing some competition.''</p>
        <p>Samaranch, attending his last Games as the I.O.C. president, left Sydney the morning after presiding over Friday's opening ceremony and flew to Barcelona, Spain, to be with his wife, Maria Teresa. But she died, after an illness of several months, a few hours before he arrived.</p>
        <p>Her body was cremated Sunday in Barcelona, where the family received condolences from Spain's King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar. (AP)</p>
        <p>Canadian Equestrian Out</p>
        <p>The Canadian Olympic Association said today that the star show-jumper Eric Lamaze, a major medal hope in Sydney, had been thrown off the team for using cocaine. ''Mr. Lamaze's use of cocaine is in direct contravention of the agreement he signed,'' the Canadian Olympic Association's president, Bill Warren, said. (Agence France-Presse)</p>
