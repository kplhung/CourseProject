        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, trying to put Hillary Rodham Clinton on the defensive over her campaign finance practices, declared today that he had obtained pledges from 14 political groups to stay out of the New York Senate race if Mrs. Clinton renounces soft money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio pointed out that Mrs. Clinton had demanded agreements from these groups, which had vowed to defeat her, before she would stop raising soft money, which can be donated in unlimited amounts.

        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, trying to put Hillary Rodham Clinton on the defensive over her campaign finance practices, declared today that he had obtained pledges from 14 political groups to stay out of the New York Senate race if Mrs. Clinton renounces soft money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio pointed out that Mrs. Clinton had demanded agreements from these groups, which had vowed to defeat her, before she would stop raising soft money, which can be donated in unlimited amounts. Now, Mr. Lazio contended in a speech here, she had no choice but to abide by her promise.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton responded that she was now more willing to discuss an agreement banning soft money from the contest.</p>
        <p>But the two campaigns quickly fell into squabbling over the details, and could not even agree on the terms of a meeting. At the same time, the chairman of the Republican State Committee, William D. Powers, indicated through a spokesman that he would not abide by any agreement prohibiting spending in the race by committees and groups outside the two campaigns.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's aides seized on Mr. Powers's position as evidence of their belief that Mr. Lazio's allies would not abandon their efforts to defeat her.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, showed up at Mrs. Clinton's headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, saying he wanted to negotiate an agreement immediately. His counterpart on the Clinton campaign, Bill de Blasio, met him at the doorway of the headquarters and told Mr. Dal Col that he would be happy to talk on Thursday morning.</p>
        <p>Posing for the cameras, their aides urging them on, the two men then argued for several minutes over whether reporters should be allowed into such a meeting. Mr. Dal Col said they should, saying that the public had a right to know the views of the two campaigns. Mr. de Blasio suggested that allowing reporters in would turn the meeting into a circus.</p>
        <p>The confrontation tonight capped several weeks of wrangling between the two campaigns over the issue of soft money, the largely unregulated contributions raised by political committees. Soft money is not supposed to be used to help candidates, but in recent years, the parties have spent it in ways -- typically commercials -- that are clearly an effort to assist their candidates.</p>
        <p>The campaigns have also fought over spending by advocacy groups independent of the parties, particularly conservative ones that are committed to defeating Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, at a conference here organized by a statewide journalists' association, released 14 letters from independent groups that promised not to raise or spend soft money on his behalf as long as Mrs. Clinton did the same.</p>
        <p>''This, ladies and gentlemen, is now a test of character for Mrs. Clinton,'' Mr. Lazio said, repeating a persistent theme from the stump.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton requested the letters from the groups this month as a condition of her abiding by a challenge she issued in May for the candidates to abstain from such money, which advocates of campaign finance reform say taints politics with shadowy contributors seeking to buy influence.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, after learning of the letters, said she was prepared to sign a pledge against soft money, but questions swiftly arose about the terms under which the 14 groups would stay out of the race. For example, one of the groups, the Conservative Leadership Pac, said it would not spend soft money in the race, but would reserve the right to spend hard money -- contributions subject to limits and strictly regulated by the Federal Election Commission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who has used the campaign finance reform issue to question Mrs. Clinton's trustworthiness, said his offer stood for 72 hours, but vowed not to open soft money accounts. Unlike Mr. Lazio, Mrs. Clinton has raised several million dollars in soft money. Neither the state Conservative Party, which is running a soft money ad critical of Mrs. Clinton, nor the state Republican Party, which has also run critical soft money ads, were listed in the agreement.</p>
        <p>The first lady, who spoke an hour after Mr. Lazio at the meeting, said she was willing to sign an agreement pending a close review of the letters. In response to a question on whether she was now willing to give up soft money, she replied, ''I am prepared to do that, and I'm very encouraged by what I heard.</p>
        <p>''I obviously didn't hear about it until I landed here in Albany,'' she continued, ''and I'm going to ask my campaign immediately to meet with his and figure out if what he's offered is compatible with the request I've been making for months, and we'll get to work on that right away.''</p>
        <p>Later, she added, ''we're going to have to look at everything, but certainly if we make an agreement to do with away with soft money, I assume it will include everything. Now obviously there are groups that we have no direct control over that you will have to ask to abide by whatever agreement you reach, but we will look at the whole range of issues that are raised by this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has released the letters while facing questions about his tactics in the debate last week in which he approached Mrs. Clinton's lectern and gestured for her to sign a pledge banning soft money. Mrs. Clinton and her advisers had pushed the notion he was overbearing, a complaint that Mr. Lazio dismissed as ''sexist,'' though his campaign was growing concerned that the message behind his gesture was being lost.</p>
        <p>During a question-and-answer session with the journalists' group, the New York State Associated Press Association, Mr. Lazio explained today why he had chosen to press the issue.</p>
        <p>A New York Times/CBS News poll released today found that two-thirds of the respondents liked Mr. Lazio's proposal. Respondents tended, though, to question the candidates' motivations, with some suggesting that both wanted to keep the campaign finance system the way it is.</p>
        <p>''I think there are a lot of things polls do not pick up,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''Campaign finance reform is a proxy issue for people's belief in the political system, that people are being trustworthy and truthful.''</p>
