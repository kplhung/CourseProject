        <p>Bowing to the inevitable, Los Angeles city officials have agreed to accept a federal court agreement that would require a series of long-sought changes in police management and training to head off a threatened civil rights lawsuit over what the Justice Department has called a systemic pattern of abusive conduct by officers here.</p>

        <p>Bowing to the inevitable, Los Angeles city officials have agreed to accept a federal court agreement that would require a series of long-sought changes in police management and training to head off a threatened civil rights lawsuit over what the Justice Department has called a systemic pattern of abusive conduct by officers here.</p>
        <p>The City Council voted 10 to 2 on Tuesday to accept a binding federal consent decree, after Mayor Richard J. Riordan rescinded his threat of a veto and Police Chief Bernard C. Parks reluctantly dropped his opposition. Mr. Riordan won office in 1993 on a pledge to expand the police department and did so, only to find himself over the past year facing the threat of the lawsuit, plus a separate local investigation into police corruption and evidence-tampering that amounts to the worst such scandal in decades.</p>
        <p>The agreement, which has yet to be given final approval by the Justice Department and a federal court, would require the department to collect data on the race of people stopped by officers in an effort to determine the extent of racial profiling, install a computerized tracking system to track complaints and disciplinary actions against officers, strengthen the civilian board of commissioners that oversees the police and create a special department unit to investigate shootings and use of force by officers.</p>
        <p>''I think it's just terrific as a first step to police reform,'' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor at the University of Southern California and the author of a report for the police union that recommended accepting the consent decree and adopting similar changes.</p>
        <p>''My only caution is that it's just a first step,'' Professor Chemerinsky said. ''I think it's very important that this not be the occasion for declaring victory and moving on, because there's a lot it doesn't do.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, police conduct has been a major civic and political issue here at least since the videotaped beating of the motorist Rodney G. King in 1991 and a subsequent inquiry by Warren M. Christopher, which recommended broad changes in police management, some of which, like the tracking system for problem officers, have been delayed and argued over since. One goal of the threatened lawsuit, which federal officials announced in May, has been to force such changes now.</p>
        <p>Bill Lann Lee, assistant attorney general for civil rights, expressed satisfaction at the vote. ''This is yet another positive step, and we look forward to working with the negotiating team to reach a final agreement,'' Mr. Lee said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department has been conducting its inquiry since 1996, centering on excessive use of force by officers. It is operating under a 1994 federal law inspired by the King beating and the 1992 riots sparked by the acquittal of officers in the case.</p>
        <p>The law authorizes federal prosecutors to go to court to force changes in the operations of local departments if it finds a ''pattern and practice'' of misconduct. Los Angeles would be the largest city to come under such supervision but the Justice Department has already reached consent decrees with police departments in Pittsburgh and Steubenville, Ohio, and with the New Jersey State Police, where the aim was to bar racial profiling in traffic stops by troopers. The United States attorney's office in Brooklyn has amassed what officials call evidence of systemwide problems in the New York Police Department's handling of brutality complaints, and the office is pressing New York for changes with the threat of a similar suit.</p>
        <p>The city attorney and a majority of the Democratic-controlled City Council here, many of whose members have been seeking changes in the police department for years, had favored a consent decree, which would be overseen by an independent monitor and supervised by a federal judge. But Mr. Riordan, a Republican, and Mr. Parks had bitterly resisted any measure that smacked of ceding local control and resisted collecting data on racial profiling. Mr. Riordan agreed to support an agreement as long as it included language aimed at ensuring that city officials would retain management of the department, that paperwork for officers would be minimized and that the consent decree would expire after five years unless the Justice Department sought to extend it.</p>
        <p>Officially, the department reports to a board of civilian commissioners appointed by the mayor, but it has long enjoyed an unusual degree of autonomy and regularly resisted civilian oversight. Voters approved creation of the office of an inspector general, recommended by Mr. Christopher's commission, to review department conduct, but the first two incumbents in that post complained that the department resisted requests for documents and data.</p>
        <p>''The real question about the consent decree is will Parks comply,'' said Joe Domanick, the author of ''To Protect and to Serve,'' a 1994 history of the department. ''Because it goes against his entire professional and temperamental grain. But I do think it'll have to be a bit different now, because if the chief doesn't comply, then the monitor can take the department to federal court and order him to comply.''</p>
        <p>Among elements the Justice Department has said would be part of an agreement are tightened controls of the police units that monitor gangs, stricter guidelines for the use of confidential informants and a campaign of ''community outreach'' aimed at restoring public confidence.</p>
        <p>Since last fall, the city has been shaken by a police corruption scandal that came to light after a rogue former officer in an antigang unit confessed to shooting an unarmed suspect and leaving him paralyzed, then testifying falsely at trial to send him to jail. More than 100 convictions have been thrown out by judges and prosecutors and 20 officers have left active duty. Officials say they expect more than 250 lawsuits to be filed by people wrongly accused of crimes, with potential legal costs to the city running into the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
