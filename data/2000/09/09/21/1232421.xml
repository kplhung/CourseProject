        <p>From the moment Alberto K. Fujimori entered politics little more than a decade ago, his most powerful weapon at times of crisis has been the element of surprise. Now, as he faces the most serious challenge to his hold on power, he appears to be counting once again on guile, agility and sleight of hand to save the day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori's announcement at  the weekend that he intends to call  elections in which he will not be a candidate for president caught even his most bitter enemies off guard and seemed a crushing admission of defeat.</p>
        <p>But even as the opposition continues to clamor for his immediate resignation, he has set about rewriting the rules of the political game here.</p>
        <p>''He has not surrendered, not by any means,'' Mirko Lauer, a prominent Lima political analyst, said today. ''He is preparing for a transition to a new government that he expects to follow the Fujimori line, a transition that is tailored to his own designs.''</p>
        <p>The crisis was set off late last week with the broadcast of a videotape showing Mr. Fujimori's national security chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, paying a $15,000 bribe to an opposition congressman to get him to go over to the government side. On Saturday night Mr. Fujimori announced his intention to ''dismantle'' the National Intelligence Service, which Mr. Montesinos heads, but he has not yet ordered either his aide's arrest or his formal dismissal.</p>
        <p>At a news conference called abruptly on Tuesday night, Mr. Fujimori deflected questions about Mr. Montesinos's status and whereabouts and his own relationship with the military, insisting that ''there is no vacuum of power.'' Instead, he outlined a complicated timetable for presidential and congressional elections that would culminate in the swearing in of a successor next July 28, more than 10 months from now.</p>
        <p>''I'm going, but I'm staying'' was the headline the daily La Republica used today to summarize Mr. Fujimori's plan. Another opposition daily, Liberacion, dismissed the package of constitutional amendments and electoral changes that Mr. Fujimori said would be introduced in Congress as an indication that he ''wants to impose his dauphin through fraudulent balloting.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, said Santiago Pedraglio, a political analyst here, ''he intends to maintain his control until July 28 as monolithically as he can.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori's real objective, Mr. Pedraglio added, , is ''an orderly withdrawal of his own people, so as to have the capacity to negotiate with the new government and pave the way for his own return'' to power.</p>
        <p>Indeed, at the news conference, which ended nearly 72 hours of silence that had this country of 25 million people fearing that a military coup was imminent, Mr. Fujimori proposed constitutional changes that would do just that. After ignoring both domestic and international public opinion to gain a third five-year term in office, he is now proposing that his successor be limited to a single term.</p>
        <p>''I've got a little surprise for you about what I'm going to do'' in 2006, Mr. Fujimori said Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori has always shown a liking for the knockout blow that comes when adversaries least expect it. He shut down Congress and the Supreme Court to assume authoritarian powers in 1992, crippled one guerrilla insurgency with a lightening raid that captured its leader and wiped out another by attacking its members even as they were holding hostages at the Japanese Embassy here.</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Fujimori will be able to carry out this new plan, however, is an altogether different matter. As Mr. Lauer pointed out, Mr. Fujimori's problem right now is ''not that people cannot count on him, but that he has no one on whom he can rely,'' above all Mr. Montesinos and the armed forces.</p>
        <p>So far, though, Peru's fragmented and fractious opposition has not been able to mount much of a threat to him, and it is unclear whether it will be able to take full advantage of the opportunities the crisis offers. ''I think the opposition can win, but I'm not so sure they can unite,'' Mr. Pedraglio said.</p>
        <p>At a news conference today, Alejandro Toledo, Mr. Fujimori's opponent in the first round of balloting in  spring that were marred by widespread accusations of vote rigging, reiterated the opposition's call for a transition government led by a figure with ''credibility and international respect.'' He suggested Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former United Nations secretary general, or the government's ombudsman, Jorge Santistevan, as possible candidates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toledo said that Mr. Montesinos must first be fired and face criminal charges and that elections  then be held in four or five months with a transition government meanwhile.</p>
        <p>While saying that ''this is not the time to talk about candidacies,'' Mr. Toledo indicated that he continued to view himself as the logical candidate of an opposition coalition. But a poll published Tuesday in the daily El Comercio showed that Fernando Olivera, the congressman who detonated the crisis by making the compromising videotapes public, has the same level of popular support.</p>
        <p>The poll results highlight a traditional problem here. Peru is a country in which ''there are no parties, only leaders,'' all of whom aspire to the presidency, the political analyst Fernando Rospigliosi said today.</p>
        <p>The opposition groups have further hampered themselves by setting conditions for the resumption of  a ''national dialogue'' promoted by the Organization of American States and boycotting proceedings in the Peruvian Congress. They object to the refusal of Fujimori loyalists to relinquish control of the legislature, a stand that analysts say is likely to play into the president's hands.</p>
        <p>''To the extent that Fujimori controls the electoral process, he can produce opposition candidates made to his measure,'' Mr. Lauer said. ''There could be five or six of them, which would pull votes away from the united coalition.''</p>
        <p>That factor is important because  of one of the consitutional changes  that Mr. Fujimori is proposing. Instead of needing a majority in the first round of balloting to avert a runoff, a candidate would have only to register a 10 percent lead over the closest contender to be elected, a prospect that becomes more likely if the opposition is fragmented.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toledo today vowed to organize street demonstrations if Mr. Fujimori refuses to step down. But the opposition, a Latin American diplomat said, ''has not demonstrated a capacity to convoke mass protests on a sustained, national level'' and ''found Fujimori's decision to call new elections so unexpected that it is still searching for a coherent response'' to the new situation.</p>
        <p>''I have a mandate to govern, and I will continue governing,'' Mr. Fujimori said Tuesday night. ''A transition government? There is no way I will allow that.''</p>
