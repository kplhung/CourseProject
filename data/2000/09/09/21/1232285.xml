        <p>Plans for two new arts centers were announced this month in Los Angeles. The more prominent is a 150,000-square-foot reconstruction of the Dixon Arts Center at the University of California at Los Angeles by Richard Meier (rendering, right). Mr. Meier, who designed the Getty Center, is but the latest New York architect to build on that campus. His design weaves together studios and galleries, and will make a connection by terraces to a sculpture garden and academic buildings. It seems an elegant planning solution and a high-quality, if familiar, white modernist Meier building.</p>

        <p>Plans for two new arts centers were announced this month in Los Angeles. The more prominent is a 150,000-square-foot reconstruction of the Dixon Arts Center at the University of California at Los Angeles by Richard Meier (rendering, right). Mr. Meier, who designed the Getty Center, is but the latest New York architect to build on that campus. His design weaves together studios and galleries, and will make a connection by terraces to a sculpture garden and academic buildings. It seems an elegant planning solution and a high-quality, if familiar, white modernist Meier building.</p>
        <p>The other center (below) is also a reconstruction, of the humbler Palos Verdes Art Center. But it is in some ways a more daring project, by Andrea Ponsi, a little-known Italian. Mr. Ponsi, 50, an architect, teacher and furniture designer based in Florence, was chosen through an open competition (rare in the United States) of 640 architects from 44 countries, who learned of the project through the Internet. Mr. Ponsi conceived a 22,000-square-foot cascade of buildings that blend into their terraced site and are knitted together by wood cladding, screens and trellises. The project is testimony, said Scott Ward, executive director of the center, to the impact ''of the Internet and the power of art.'' The U.C.L.A. arts center starts construction in 2002; Palos Verdes is about to begin a fund-raising program to build Mr. Ponsi's design.</p>
        <p>CURRENTS: LOS ANGELES -- DESIGN  Correction:  September 28, 2000, Thursday  A report in the Currents column last Thursday about the redesign of an art center at the University of California at Los Angeles misspelled the center's name. It is the Dickson Art Center, not Dixon.</p>
