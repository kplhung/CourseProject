        <p>''Some day he's going to crush me,'' Fabrice Santoro said. ''It's just a matter of time.''</p>
        <p>The force of nature in question was Marat Safin: the man of the moment in tennis and the man who crushed Pete Sampras in the final of the United States Open less than two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>But for now, if only for now, Santoro is too much for Safin, and today the small, clever Frenchman defeated the powerful and undoubtedly jet-lagged Russian in the first round of the Olympic tournament, 1-6, 6-1, 6-4.</p>
        <p>To the casual observer, that score must resonate like a major upset; must resonate as loudly as the crack that Safin's racket made as he angrily smashed it against a box underneath the umpire's chair midway through the second set. But how could it be an upset when Santoro has won all five of their encounters?</p>
        <p>''Everyone has a guy they don't like to play,'' said Safin's Russian teammate, Yevgeny Kafelnikov. ''Marat's guy is Fabrice. It's a psychological effect. There's nothing you can do about it; no matter how good you are playing. It has nothing to do with the jet lag. It's the opponent.''</p>
        <p>Safin could certainly be forgiven for feeling weary. After winning the United States Open, he quickly left New York for a minor tournament in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. After winning that event on Sunday, he flew to Sydney via Bangkok and did not arrive until 5 a.m., the day before this match. Santoro, a late addition to the French team after Sebastien Grosjean sustained an injury, has been here since last week.</p>
        <p>Safin refused to make excuses after his 12-match winning streak ended. ''You lose concentration because you get upset, not because you are tired,'' he said. ''If you are tired, you are going to lose 6-0 in the third set. It's not a question at all. I'm 20 years old. I have enough energy to play.''</p>
        <p>He played superbly in the first set, smacking winners with his groundstrokes and his serve and moving fluidly as Santoro lunged right and left and had difficulty countering Safin's superior power. If these two were prizefighters, they would fight in very different classes. Safin is 6 feet 4 inches and about 185 pounds; the 28-year-old Santoro is 5-10 and about 160.</p>
        <p>Santoro's two-handed ground strokes off both sides and frequent use of slice and dropshots rub many players' nerves and rhythm the wrong way (he has beaten Sampras and Andre Agassi). He is also adroit at the net, and when the second set began, he began pushing forward with greater frequency. He broke the Russian's serve three times in the second set, mixing angled volleys with great gets and jarring changes of pace. His leitmotif was keeping the ball low.</p>
        <p>To Safin's credit, he pulled his big game together in the final set. What he could not do was crack Santoro's serve despite three break points in the first game and one more in the fifth. In the opening exchange of the ninth game, he lost the point on a questionable call and argued vehemently with the chair umpire, Mike Morrissey, and when Santoro held after a struggle to take a 5-4 lead, Safin was left shaking his head. In the next game, at 15-30 he shanked a low overhead long and then watched as Santoro knocked a reflex backhand volley past him to win the match.</p>
        <p>For now, Safin will have to settle for being popular with the Clinton family (Father Bill called after the Open victory; daughter Chelsea was courtside today) and immensely popular at home. ''Marat is the No. 1 athlete in Russia right now,'' said Shamil Tarpischev, the Russian International Olympic Committee member and Davis Cup captain.</p>
        <p>Safin's victory in Uzbekistan pushed him past Sampras into the No. 1 spot in the yearlong points race, and a good performance here would have allowed him to take over the No. 1 spot on the 52-week entry system used to determine seedings.</p>
        <p>''I'm angry with myself because I can't fight for the gold medal,'' Safin said. ''I'm angry because I couldn't make it to No. 1 in the world. I'm angry because I'm still losing to Santoro, and I'm angry because of the chair umpire.''</p>
        <p>Santoro could only be delighted. ''This is my best victory over Marat,'' he said. ''But let's not forget that I'm still a long way from the podium.''</p>
        <p>Not nearly as far as Safin, but the Russian still has a chance for a medal; he is playing doubles here with Kafelnikov. And it must be nice to know that Santoro is not entered in that event.</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>The Australian teenager JELENA DOKIC won her first-round match, 6-0, 7-6 (1), over 14th-seeded AI SUGIYAMA of Japan. Dokic's father DAMIR, who was recently banned from WTA Tour events for six months after a series of altercations, was not in attendance, although he could have watched if he had bought his own ticket.</p>
