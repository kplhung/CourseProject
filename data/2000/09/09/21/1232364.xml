        <p>Football players, with the notable exception of Keyshawn Johnson, tend to be incredibly reserved when discussing coming opponents. Giving the other team any extra incentive is their greatest fear so they usually opt for a dose of diplomacy over reality.</p>
        <p>So it was hard to come by anyone on the Giants today who was willing to say what a victory Sunday night over the reeling Redskins would do for their season. Despite the denials, the Giants would control the National Football Conference East if they beat Washington.</p>
        <p>The Giants (3-0) are one of only five undefeated teams in the National Football League, and the only one in their division. Arizona (1-1) is the only other team without two losses. Washington, Dallas and Philadelphia are each 1-2.</p>
        <p>Beating Washington Sunday would make the Giants 4-0 for the first time since 1990, the season they won the Super Bowl. A third loss would be a huge setback for the Redskins, already fending off the beginnings of a quarterback controversy and questions about Coach Norv Turner's job security.</p>
        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel has resisted putting any more importance on the Redskins game. His players are fully aware of and understand the ramifications of the game.</p>
        <p>''I get into how we're going to beat them, not what the results of beating them are going to be,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>''We've got to worry about getting ready,'' linebacker Jessie Armstead said. ''We can't get ahead.''</p>
        <p>One thing Fassel and his players have not been afraid to do is speak in defense of the embattled Redskins, praising running back Stephen Davis and asserting how Monday night's 27-21 loss to Dallas in Washington had as much to do with the teams' rivalry as with any mistakes the Redskins made.</p>
        <p>Many Giants watched the game on television.</p>
        <p>''When I saw they lost to the Cowboys, I was like, man, we have to be ready because I know the type of guys they have,'' linebacker Mike Barrow said. ''Bruce Smith and Deion Sanders, those guys are fighters.''</p>
        <p>The idea of facing a desperate team is not alien to the Giants. Last week, they played in Chicago, where the Bears were trying to avoid an 0-3 start. The Giants were mistake prone but won.</p>
        <p>That is something Washington has been unable to accomplish. The beleaguered quarterback Brad Johnson will keep his starting job this week, but the free agent Jeff George looms on the sideline. Johnson, a Pro Bowl selection last year, today said the offense was playing well despite having trouble scoring. He has thrown five interceptions in the past two games, including four in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Johnson, in a conference call with New York reporters, did not dismiss the idea of his job being on the line Sunday but said he and George had a good relationship.</p>
        <p>''I've never looked over my shoulder, and I've always been around tremendous quarterbacks,'' Johnson said.</p>
        <p>But the Giants have a game plan to defend against Johnson and George, and at least one player sounded as if he expected to see both Sunday.</p>
        <p>''If you ask me this question, you know he's probably going to come in the game,'' Giants cornerback Dave Thomas said, referring to George.</p>
        <p>One thing the Giants do not seem to mind is painting themselves as the have-nots in this rivalry. The Washington owner, Daniel Snyder, went on a spending spree during the off-season. Compare that with the Giants' tango with the salary cap.</p>
        <p>''We went to the junkyard and pulled things off of spare parts,'' Giants guard Glenn Parker said. ''They went to the Ferrari and Porsche lot, and took what they wanted.''</p>
        <p>The metaphor was simple. The Giants are winning with less-publicized acquisitions; Parker is one of three new players on a rapidly developing offensive line. The Redskins are struggling to play up to their talent level.</p>
        <p>''Ferraris and Porsches are nice cars,'' Parker said. ''They look great sitting in the driveway.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The trays of grass between the yard markers that run the length of the Giants Stadium field have been replaced with new sod. The previous grass had not grown in well and was coming apart during Giants and Jets games. This week's transplant is part of a scheduled maintenance program. . . . Tight end PETE MITCHELL missed practice Wednesday with an intestinal infection. Guard RON STONE was on the field but also did not practice because of a sore right ankle. Both are expected to practice Thursday. . . . The Giants lead the league in average time of possession, 36 minutes 9 seconds. . . . Washington Coach NORV TURNER did not think teams have benefited from scouting the Redskins' summer training camp. Because Washington charges for parking an admission for fans to watch practice, National Football League rules require the Redskins to allow scouts to attend. The Giants are among many teams that took advantage.</p>
