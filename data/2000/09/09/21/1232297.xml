        <p>PERHAPS it would interest you to know that during the first quarter of this year, 50.4 percent of Internet users were women. You might be intrigued by the recent news that the number of people who visited Gov. George W. Bush's official Web site, www.georgewbush.com, soared 522 percent after a new version opened last month.

        <p>PERHAPS it would interest you to know that during the first quarter of this year, 50.4 percent of Internet users were women. You might be intrigued by the recent news that the number of people who visited Gov. George W. Bush's official Web site, www.georgewbush.com, soared 522 percent after a new version opened last month. Or maybe you will find it fascinating to learn that the money spent on business-to-business online advertising is expected to reach $3 billion by 2005.</p>
        <p>Then again, you may not care in the least.</p>
        <p>The many figures, projections and demographic revelations that those in the Internet business have decided are relevant to the public may demonstrate just one incontrovertible fact: the compulsion to measure has run amok.</p>
        <p>Market research is nothing new, of course. But as recently as 10 years ago, research results were, for the most part, shared quietly with the companies who used them to chart business strategies. Today, they are the stuff of headlines. Internet research now commands the same kind of attention as political polls and baseball statistics. But sports fans, baseball addicts in particular, demand their numbers. It's all part of the pleasure of the pastime. And political polls are just another type of scorekeeping.</p>
        <p>Keeping track of the Internet industry is different. The number of online advertisers may be useful to companies plotting their courses in the online world, but the statistic is so much white noise to the public at large.  Few people are likely to grow cranky if not given a daily dose of Web site rankings or told how many Web-enabled cell phones will be on the market by year's end. In the rush to inform the public on all matters related to the Internet, no one has asked the most obvious question: Who really cares?</p>
        <p>First, there's the pat explanation, which invokes the famous dictum, much embraced by statisticians, by the physicist Lord Kelvin: ''When you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind.''</p>
        <p>That is a sentiment echoed enthusiastically among the growing ranks of market research and measurement firms that focus on the Internet.</p>
        <p>''We're a society thirsty for information, and data tells us something about how we're doing,'' said Doug McFarland, a senior vice president at Media Metrix, a New York firm with offices worldwide that churn out regular reports on things like Web site popularity. ''We're also a very scientific society, and we like to have that precision of data.''</p>
        <p>Then there's the less lofty, more cynical perspective. ''It's really about money,'' said Maryann Jones Thompson, who is editorial director of the Metrics section for The Industry Standard, a weekly magazine about the Internet economy that devotes six pages of each issue to various statistics.</p>
        <p>''There's such a clamor for attention in the press,'' she said, ''that companies have learned that a great way to get publicity is to produce a study about your market and issue it as a study and have reporters pick it up.'' And reporters, this one included, have been known to do just that.</p>
        <p>Market research reports are used as tools to sell products. Corporate clients pay as much as $45,000 a year to receive sales projections for e-commerce, m-commerce (that's commerce conducted over mobile devices), cell phones and personal digital assistants.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the companies usually get what they pay for. A study sponsored by a Spanish-language site reveals that Hispanics are rushing to get online. A study paid for by a Web site geared at women concludes that women are more likely to buy things online than men are. Yet another -- commissioned by, of all things, a cell phone retailer -- finds that Americans are optimistic about the ways cell phones will be used in the future.</p>
        <p>Prof. Stephen Fienberg, the Maurice Falk university professor of statistics and social science at Carnegie Mellon University, said that people should be wary of the profusion of market studies masquerading as social science. ''One needs to make a distinction,'' he said, ''between the carefully crafted surveys that get done by government agencies like the Census Bureau, and just using the tools to make a buck, where the methodology isn't taken all that seriously, even though there's a gloss and spin on what they do.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, the press has called the accuracy of the market research firms' predictions into question, criticizing them as inflated and designed to promote a particular market sector. But Ms. Thompson said that after comparing older forecasts with what had actually transpired in a market, her staff had found that analysts' predictions often turned out to be conservative.  For example, Ms. Thompson's group found that four market research firms had underestimated the amount consumers would spend on online holiday shopping last year.</p>
        <p>Josh Bernoff, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, a large, high-profile market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., said, ''We have a 70 plus percent renewal rate among our clients so people are getting valuable things out of this.''</p>
        <p>Consider, for instance, a recent report from the Cahners In-Stat Group predicting that the use of wireless data technology would ''skyrocket'' from about 170 million subscribers worldwide in 2000 to more than 1.3 billion in 2004. That would put a wireless data device in the palm of one in every five people on the planet.</p>
        <p>Ask Cahners more about the report, however, and you will find that the number of subscribers does not mean the number of individuals. If one person subscribes to three different services, Cahners counts that as three subscribers, not one. Also, to reach its projection of 1.3 billion, Cahners queried not consumers themselves, but carriers, like Verizon and AT&amp;T Wireless, whose projections are bound to be optimistic.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jakob Nielsen, principal of Nielsen Norman Group, a product and Web design consulting firm, saw another flaw in the report. ''Let us for a minute accept the estimate that there may be 1.5 billion handsets and other devices with wireless capability sold between now and 2004,'' Dr. Nielsen said. That may be reasonable, he said, if one makes a projection based on the number of cell phones sold per year these days.</p>
        <p>''However, it does not follow from 'X devices sold' that there will be 'X users of wireless data.' '' he said. If people find the devices too difficult to use, he said, many will use them simply as cell phones.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, there was no shortage of press coverage on the report. ''Jeekers, I can't even tell you about the press calls I got,'' said Rebecca Diercks, director of wireless research for Cahners In-Stat. Ms. Diercks then rattled off a list of news outlets that had called her: Wireless Week, CNET, The Oregonian and Newsday.</p>
        <p>If the forecasts are sometimes questionable, the relevance of Internet statistics to consumers is even more difficult to fathom.</p>
        <p>There are, for example, Web site rankings generated by Media Metrix and a handful of competitors. The rankings hold as much surprise as a McDonald's menu. The top 50 sites are a collection of usual suspects:  Yahoo, eBay and Amazon.com. Yet Media Metrix also gets about 200 calls a day from journalists who are looking for rankings data sliced dozens of different ways.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Mr. Bernoff, of Forrester, is a staunch defender of the practice of publicizing statistics, particularly those that represent milestones. ''Big numbers are exciting,'' he said. ''People are fascinated with big magnitudes and transitions. It's the same as when you were a kid and the odometer turned over from 39999 to 40000. ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Thompson is more skeptical. ''I don't know necessarily that readers are internalizing all this,'' she said, ''or whether they actually feel like they need it, but it is definitely being covered by the media.''</p>
        <p>And people do seem to read it. Ms. Thompson said the Metrics section of The Industry Standard was one of the magazine's more popular sections. And that's not just an educated guess. ''Of course, we have the numbers on that,'' she said.</p>
