        <p>In an early morning raid yesterday, the Spanish authorities seized documents from the offices of Coca-Cola and its bottlers, investigating complaints that the companies had used illegal business tactics to keep rival soft drinks off the country's shelves.</p>
        <p>Acting on complaints filed last year by PepsiCo and La Casera, a Spanish beverage company, officials from the Ministry of Economy appeared without warning at Coke's corporate offices in Madrid, where they spent several hours looking through records pertaining to the company's competitive practices.

        <p>In an early morning raid yesterday, the Spanish authorities seized documents from the offices of Coca-Cola and its bottlers, investigating complaints that the companies had used illegal business tactics to keep rival soft drinks off the country's shelves.</p>
        <p>Acting on complaints filed last year by PepsiCo and La Casera, a Spanish beverage company, officials from the Ministry of Economy appeared without warning at Coke's corporate offices in Madrid, where they spent several hours looking through records pertaining to the company's competitive practices. Investigators also confiscated documents from three independent companies that bottle and distribute Coke across Spain, responding to complaints that they, too, had pressed stores and restaurants not to carry other brands.</p>
        <p>Investigators are looking for evidence that might substantiate competitors' contentions that Coke either required supermarkets and other businesses to promote and sell its drinks exclusively or offered them cash incentives and unusual discounts to do so. In June, Coke lost a lawsuit brought in Texas by nine Royal Crown bottlers accusing the company of engaging in similar practices, resulting in a $15.6 million judgment against Coke.</p>
        <p>Coke has been investigated by antitrust authorities across the globe. Inquiries are under way in more than 10 countries, mostly in Europe, and raids have become commonplace enough that Coke officials in Spain described them yesterday as ''established procedure.''</p>
        <p>''There's certainly a pattern here,'' said Ben Deutsch, a Coke spokesman. ''We believe through our experience in other countries that our competitors are more interested in these legal procedures than developing marketing programs that meet consumers' needs.''</p>
        <p>Acknowledging that its complaints are part of a larger strategy to gain market share abroad -- where Coke's dominance is significantly more pronounced than in the United States -- Pepsi officials said they had no choice but to seek the intervention of the authorities.</p>
        <p>''The common thread is abuse of dominance,'' said Larry Jabbonsky, a Pepsi spokesman.</p>
