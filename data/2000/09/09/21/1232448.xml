        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Undercover Buying, Fake Names and All'' (Online Shopper, Sept. 14), about trying to preserve one's anonymity while shopping online: Michelle Slatalla shouldn't have shied away from buying a Bruce Springsteen CD because of her husband's teasing. His reference to Springsteen as the ''Wayne Newton of our generation'' is ridiculous. People used to compare Newton with Frank Sinatra. Maybe your husband just doesn't like The Boss because he's been ''mainstreamed.''</p>

        <p>Re ''Undercover Buying, Fake Names and All'' (Online Shopper, Sept. 14), about trying to preserve one's anonymity while shopping online: Michelle Slatalla shouldn't have shied away from buying a Bruce Springsteen CD because of her husband's teasing.

        <p>Sinatra remains popular even after his music has gone out of style,  and nobody argues about his genius. Like him or not, Bruce Springsteen is an important and influential American singer and songwriter.</p>
        <p>We women should always remember three things about our husbands: Never let them teach you how to drive a stick shift, never let them do the laundry (particularly your laundry), and never let them pick your tunes.</p>
