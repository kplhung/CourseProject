        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You point out (front page, Sept. 18) that responsible people recognize the need for insurance, but increasingly find the cost oppressive, or totally out of reach.</p>
        <p>What most of us really want is true insurance, against major, catastrophic expenses. Paying directly for annual checkups and the odd bout of flu would not be a problem for most working people; forcing routine health care events through insurance channels only adds administrative expense, reduces choice and hamstrings both doctors and patients.</p>
        <p>Since wages and health benefits are just different forms of compensation, those with coverage at work need to speak up about the way employers spend their health care dollars for them. Employers should offer plans that return decision-making to patients and doctors, even if it means routine medical expenses aren't fully ''covered.''</p>
