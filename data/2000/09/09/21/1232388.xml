        <p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' general manager and the communications director yesterday asked Keyshawn Johnson to tone down his six-month tirade against the Jets. So yesterday, in the second of three news conferences Johnson is holding before the unbeaten Jets and the unbeaten Buccaneers in Tampa, Fla., on Sunday, the receiver seemed to go out of his way to say very little.</p>
        <p>But below the surface, the usually plain-spoken Johnson still seemed to be seething about his trade from the Jets in April.</p>
        <p>In recent days, Johnson has promised not to shake the hand of Jets Coach Al Groh, even if Groh offers, and he has labeled Wayne Chrebet as only the second-best receiver on the Jets behind Dedric Ward.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Rich McKay, the Buccaneers' general manager, and Reggie Roberts, the team's communications director, told Johnson to be honest but not to attack the Jets in his answers, said a team official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>The official said that while Coach Tony Dungy had not spoken to Johnson about what he should or should not say, he was told by McKay and Roberts that this was a big game and that ''he should not be in anyone's face.''</p>
        <p>So asked about Chrebet, Johnson said: ''You continue to keep comparing something to something, and it's not even relevant. Will it make you happy to see someone shake hands and hug? Is that what you want to do? You want me to say this guy makes terrific catches.''</p>
        <p>Johnson did not denigrate Chrebet or any of his other former teammates, but it was apparent that he still chafes at Chrebet's renown as a third-down receiver. Johnson had a higher yards-per-catch average on third down, though Chrebet has been among the league leaders in the number of third-down catches.</p>
        <p>Asked about his own success on third down, Johnson said: ''I've never been a third-down guy, most of the New York media will say. But I tend to do well on third downs because I know how important it is.''</p>
        <p>Johnson said he was friendly with numerous Jets players, citing Ward, Kevin Williams, Chris Hayes, Aaron Glenn, Bryan Cox, Mo Lewis and Victor Green. But Johnson added that there might be mixed emotions playing against Glenn, a Pro Bowl cornerback.</p>
        <p>''Of course, it is going to be weird,'' Johnson said. ''I mean, that's human nature. It's going to be weird, but at the same time I'm not going to lighten up on them because they are my friends. I know Chris Hayes. He tells me every day that he's going to knock my head off.''</p>
