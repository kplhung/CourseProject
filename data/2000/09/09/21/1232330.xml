        <p>Ruthie Bolton-Holifield had just rushed two shots, long 3-point heaves that bounced off the rim. Then she turned to witness something even more unsightly.</p>
        <p>Yelena Pchikova, the Russian forward, beat most of Team USA downcourt, hit a little runner from the left side and clutched her fist at the enormous possibility in front of her.</p>
        <p>The Americans trailed by 7 points, their dominance threatened by essentially the same opposition, then playing as the Unified Team, that dealt them their last Olympic loss eight years ago.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if I would use the word 'scared,' '' said Nikki McCray, the starting shooting guard for the Americans, ''but we had to show our character at some point. Or we were headed for real danger.''</p>
        <p>The United States managed to recover for an 88-77 victory after trailing by 47-44 at halftime, the first Olympic halftime deficit the American women had known since 1992.</p>
        <p>The comeback began with a McCray steal and 3-pointer with 17 minutes left. Then, with less than 12 minutes remaining, Bolton-Holifield caught fire from the perimeter, knocking down two 3-pointers and another jumper within two minutes, baskets that helped turn a 1-point lead into a 10-point bulge.</p>
        <p>Their menacing defense wore the Russians down in a performance that was more grit than skill before 8,383 at the Dome in Olympic Park.</p>
        <p>Asked if she saw the game as either a crack in the United States facade or a show of perseverance after her team moved to 3-0 in preliminary play, Coach Nell Fortner replied: ''We were resilient. We came together when we had to against some very tough opposition.''</p>
        <p>Lisa Leslie overcame early foul trouble to score 14 of her game-high 18 points in the second half. Yolanda Griffith and Sheryl Swoopes each added 16 points, and Bolton-Holifield had 12 clutch points off the bench.</p>
        <p>Russia was never out of the game, but the closest it came after the spurt was 68-63 with less than eight minutes left.</p>
        <p>Yet for much of the first 20 minutes, the Russians sliced apart the Americans' vaunted defense with precision. Point guard Anna Arkhipova (a team-high 15 points) and forward Svetlana Abrosimova, who plays for the University of Connecticut, ran the pick-and-roll as well as any tandem from the Utah Jazz, popping out for jumpers or penetrating for short bank shots.</p>
        <p>The center tandem of Yelen Chakirova and Mariya Stepanova were responsible for putting Leslie and Griffith in foul trouble.</p>
        <p>Russia took it to the Americans like no other team in the tournament, matching them in every facet until the comeback.</p>
        <p>The United States women have not lost in Olympic competition since the 1992 semifinals in Barcelona, Spain, where several of the players now on the Russian team were part of the upset. The last time the U.S. lost in international competition was against Brazil in an exhibition in Rio de Janeiro this past March.</p>
        <p>''We're not aggressive right now defensively,'' Griffith said. ''This is the third game we started slow.''</p>
        <p>Russia (2-1) seems headed for a semifinal showdown with Australia (3-0), which beat Slovakia by 70-47 tonight.</p>
        <p>As well as they played, the Russians were undermanned. Their starting point guard, Irina Soumnikova, was sidelined for the tournament when she caught an elbow in the face from a Cuban player in the opening game. Falling to the floor, she fractured her right wrist.</p>
        <p>The Russian coach, Yevgeny Gomelskiy, was still upset with the Cubans, calling the act malicious. ''She forced one of our girls to end up in a hospital,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Cuban player, Maria Leon, has denied that she purposely hit Soumnikova.</p>
        <p>What's more, center Yelena Baranova, one of Russia's best players and a star in the Women's National Basketball Association, missed the Olympics because of a knee injury.</p>
        <p>That left Arkhipova's arching 3-pointers -- she made all four she took -- and her teammates' creative passing to fill the void. Those Russian players taller than 6 feet often dribbled upcourt and picked up their defensive assignments in the backcourt.</p>
        <p>''I look at Russia, and their post players can do so much,'' McCray said. ''Can you imagine Lisa Leslie picking up someone 64 feet from the basket? They're really talented in a lot of different areas of the game, whereas we specialize a lot.''</p>
        <p>After the game, Gomelskiy congratulated the Americans for their comeback and superiority on defense. He talked about their outstanding individual skills, as if suggesting that his players had played better as a unit. He lamented a few mistakes, ''but as far as the team effort, there are no tragedies today,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If nothing else, his team gave the United States a few anxious moments.</p>
        <p>''This really wasn't a scare,'' McCray said again. ''It was a great challenge. Look, we're not going to beat the really good teams by 20 points anymore. People just have to get used to that.''</p>
