        <p>The United States Olympic baseball team, many of them unheralded minor leaguers and major league castoffs, knows that they are nobody's idea of a Dream Team. They might call themselves Olympic baseball's little-known secret.</p>
        <p>The United States, winning with drama and defense, is undefeated after four games of the Olympic baseball tournament, and the mighty Cubans, losers today to the Netherlands, are not.</p>
        <p>The medal round in baseball is still a week away and Cuba is still favored. But after another climactic late-inning victory today, the Americans are enjoying a spotlight they did not foresee and gathering self-esteem in the wake of their engaging successes.</p>
        <p>Today's hero for the United States was first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz, a Minnesota Twins farmhand who hit a towering, two-out, two-strike eighth-inning grand slam that made a scoreless game a 4-0 American victory over South Korea.</p>
        <p>For Mientkiewicz, who played all of 1999 with the Twins, it was his biggest swing since he hit a home run at Yankee Stadium off David Cone on Old-Timers' Day last year.</p>
        <p>''Maybe it wasn't a big hit because it didn't win the game, but it was my biggest relief,'' Mientkiewicz said. He was in a deep slump at the time. ''I couldn't believe I got a hit, I was running around the bases like a kid.''</p>
        <p>The left-handed-hitting Mientkiewicz, 26, behaved with more aplomb today. He even stood in the batter's box to watch his home run, then flipped his bat and raised his left index finger before circling the bases.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, I probably overdid it,'' said Mientkiewicz, who played this season with the Twins' Class AAA affiliate in Salt Lake City. ''But when it's the biggest hit of your life, I really don't care.''</p>
        <p>The United States team seems to thrive in these emotional games, and the Americans have already had a couple. Mientkiewicz, in fact, said he was emulating his teammate Mike Neill with his batter's box finger-waving Neill won the opening game against Japan with a 13th-inning two-run homer.</p>
        <p>The Americans are careful not to boast about their chances and have little to say about the Cubans, whom they will play in a preliminary game Saturday. But the United States team likes its chances and seems to be relishing the experience.</p>
        <p>''People can say we're a rag-tag group or whatever,'' outfielder Ernie Young said. ''We know we've got a lot of talent. And most of all, we've been playing like a team.''</p>
        <p>Seven shutout innings by the starting pitcher Roy Oswalt and spectacular fielding by shortstop Adam Everett and third baseman Mike Kinkade kept the United States in the game. South Korea, with several players from their professional league, left 11 runners on base and squandered several good chances to score.</p>
        <p>South Korea has lost three of four games and been a disappointment, but as the United States catcher Pat Borders said, ''They have a bunch of guys you could put in a major league uniform and they wouldn't embarrass themselves.''</p>
        <p>Borders, the most valuable player of the 1992 World Series when he was with the Toronto Blue Jays, is the eldest on the American team at 37. Borders, who spent most of this year playing for the minor league Durham Bulls in North Carolina, epitomizes the team's enthusiasm for the Olympic experience.</p>
        <p>''I thought this was going to be fun, but it's been much more than that,'' Borders said. ''I'm so glad I'm here. I get nervous before the games, nervous in the games, and as a player you like that.</p>
        <p>''It's stressful in a different way than playing in the major leagues. You don't want to make a big mistake and know you've cost your country a game. That's pretty important to me.''</p>
        <p>Borders said there was a form sent around in April, asking players if they were interested in playing for the Olympic team.</p>
        <p>''I filled it out, sent it back and never thought about it again,'' Borders said. ''When they called, I was surprised. I knew I wanted to go, but my wife never gave me a choice anyway.</p>
        <p>''She said: 'Pat, you're going. That's it.' I'm so glad I did. I love just walking around the Olympic Village and hearing all the different languages and seeing the different clothes. It's a great thing.''</p>
        <p>Borders smiled. ''And our team's playing pretty good, too,'' he added.</p>
