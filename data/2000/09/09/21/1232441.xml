        <p>Canada's federal government reported a budget surplus of 12.3 billion Canadian dollars ($8.3 billion) for the fiscal year ended March 31. It all was used to reduce debt, and an even larger surplus is building in the current fiscal year. Federal debt has been reduced by 19 billion Canadian dollars over the last two years, to 553 billion at the end of July. Debt as a percentage of gross domestic product has dropped to 59 percent from 71 percent since 1996. A budget surplus of 11.4 billion Canadian dollars in the first four months of fiscal 2000-2001 was twice as high as a year ago.</p>
