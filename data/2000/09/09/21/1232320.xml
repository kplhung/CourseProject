        <p>As an orator, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. made rich use of metaphor, often alluding to landscape -- mountains, valleys and water, shade and sunlight -- to convey emotion.</p>
        <p>''We were very fortunate; he understood what powerful imagery landscape can evoke,'' said Bonnie Fisher, a landscape architect and a partner in the ROMA Design Group, the San Francisco-based architectural and landscape firm named last week as designer of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial, to be set among the cherry trees along the Tidal Basin in Washington.</p>
        <p>Capturing Dr. King's own emotional power in a landscape will be the  formidable task of the memorial, to begin construction in 2003 on a four-acre covelike bend in the basin, across from the Jefferson Memorial.</p>
        <p>Best known as the designer of the revitalized Embarcadero here, a palm-studded oasis along the waterfront completed last June, Ms. Fisher's firm specializes in public spaces, including the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica. The firm was chosen from among 870 entries in a design competition organized by the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity (Dr. King was a member), which Congress designated to select the design and raise the money.</p>
        <p>''We didn't want it to be a monument, but a living place,'' said Dr. Ed Jackson Jr., the chairman of the design jury and the director of the Center for Building Performance at the American Institute of Architects in Washington. ''This design captured conceptually the words and message of Dr. King.''</p>
        <p>The design was selected in a two-tiered jury process that initially included the Mexican architect Ricardo Legoretta and the Indian architect Charles Correa, the designer of the Gandhi memorial in Ahmedabad. The landscape of the new memorial is largely inspired by imagery from the 1963 ''I have a dream'' speech, drawing literally on metaphors, including the ''stone of hope'' hewn from the ''mountain of despair.''</p>
        <p>In consultation with Dr. Clayborne Carson, a Stanford University history professor and the chief editor of the Martin Luther King Jr. papers, Ms. Fisher and her partner Boris Dramov played off Dr. King's references to hills and valleys, expressed in changes in grade; smoothness and roughness, in various stone textures; and the all-important symbolism of water, from streams to torrents (''we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream'').</p>
        <p>''Water and mist will cool in the heat of the day,'' Ms. Fisher said. ''Through water we wanted to build on King's words and the crescendo effect of his sermons.''</p>
        <p>Like Maya Lin's Civil Rights Memorial at the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., which also incorporates water, the design embraces other martyrs to the civil rights movement, including Medgar Evers and the four children killed in the bomb blast in Birmingham. They will be honored with 24 niches perched above a long crescent-shaped wall, spaces of contemplation, from which water will flow.</p>
        <p>The wall will arc in a half circle to form a central open gathering space.  ''As in the civil rights movement,'' Mr. Dramov said, ''we wanted to express gathering force as well as personal commitment.''</p>
        <p>Visitors will enter the memorial, the first site on the Mall to commemorate an individual African-American, in numerous ways. The formal entrance will be through two monolithic stone portals, to be cut from Stone Mountain granite (''Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia''). Inscribed with Dr. King's words, the surfaces will be polished but the edges left rough, like a boulder split down the center. Its missing piece -- the ''stone of hope'' -- will be visible near the Tidal Basin's perimeter. Emerging from the edge of this stone will be a sculptured image of Dr. King, ''as if he embodies the stone itself,'' Mr. Dramov said.</p>
        <p>In what is perhaps a response to past design controversies, especially at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the designers are using a variety of techniques to tell their story, from water flowing over inscriptions to nuanced sculpture. ''Some people relate to words, some to pictures, some to symbols,'' Mr. Dramov said. ''We're committed to all of them.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Jackson added, ''If you have multiple experiences, it will entice people to come back.''</p>
        <p>The stone of hope will look out toward the Jefferson Memorial, which is a classical temple of democracy. It will be inscribed with Dr. King's reference to democracy as ''a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.''</p>
        <p>It will be pushed forward, ''to symbolize justice, hope and democracy,'' Dr. Jackson explained. The message, he said, is ''Remember, you guys made a promise.''</p>
