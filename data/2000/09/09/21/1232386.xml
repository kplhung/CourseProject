        <p>The price of crude oil climbed again yesterday amid increasing concern about the impact of the rising price on the world's economy.</p>
        <p>In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil for October delivery jumped as high as $37.80 a barrel but gave back some of its gains late in the day, ending up 69 cents at a 10-year high of $37.20. Yesterday was the last day for the October futures contract, a day on which trading is often volatile. .</p>
        <p>The price of heating oil for October delivery ended at $1.0179 a gallon, down 0.12 cent.</p>
        <p>Oil for November delivery rose 23 cents, to $35.23 a barrel. It becomes the current, or spot, contract today. The immediate demand for oil has been strong -- so much so that the price of the near-term futures contract has been higher than the price for delivery in later months. If that kind of demand does not change, the price of the November contract can be expected to soon catch up with that of the expired October contract.</p>
        <p>The low level of supplies, both for crude oil and distillate, which is used to make home heating oil, is pushing the price higher right now.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration is expected to decide in a few days whether to release oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a step rarely invoked and one of a few developments that could put downward pressure on prices.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore is expected to add to the growing political debate over oil prices when he makes a campaign speech today outlining his proposals.</p>
        <p>The high price of oil will also be an important topic at a gathering this weekend of finance ministers of the International Monetary Fund in Prague. These discussions could put more pressure on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production.</p>
        <p>The American Petroleum Institute reported after the close of trading yesterday that crude oil inventories fell by just over two million barrels last week, to 286.6 million barrels. That is 22.2 million barrels, or 7.2 percent, below the level of a year ago. And while distillate inventories rose 1.25 million barrels, they are still 19.4 percent below last year's level.</p>
        <p>President Clinton said yesterday that he needed ''a few more days'' before deciding whether to release oil from the 571-million-barrel petroleum reserve. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who has been pushing the administration to open the oil reserve, spoke yesterday with Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.</p>
        <p>In an interview after the meeting, in which he assessed the outlook for releasing oil, he said: ''Those who were for it are more strongly for it, and those who were against it are now believing that it should be done. They didn't tell me this, but for the first time, I believe that odds are greater than 50-50'' that oil will be released from the reserve.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France called for a meeting of members of the OPEC countries, the 15 nations of the European Union and the United States. He said France would propose the meeting in Prague this weekend in conjunction with the I.M.F. meeting.</p>
        <p>Treasury Secretary Summers, after a speech at Johns Hopkins University, declined to say if he wanted to release oil from the petroleum reserve or whether he supported France's proposal. But he did say that oil would be a topic this weekend.</p>
        <p>''We are obviously watching developments in the oil market very closely,'' he told reporters. The price of oil, he added, ''is one factor bearing on the global economic outlook.''</p>
        <p>But reflecting the comments of I.M.F. officials, Mr. Summers added, ''I share the overall judgment of the I.M.F. that the global economy is healthy and in many ways healthier than it has been in some number of years.''</p>
