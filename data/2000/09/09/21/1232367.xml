        <p>A flurry of afternoon buying of technology stocks rescued the Nasdaq composite index from an early slide yesterday, but other major gauges slumped.</p>
        <p>Investors continued to fret about oil prices, which made another 10-year high, and the depressed state of the euro as more companies cautioned that quarterly results would be shy of expectations.</p>
        <p>Some, however, took heart from upbeat Wall Street comments about Intel and some other technology companies and pushed the Nasdaq composite index up 31.80 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,897.44. The index has declined 4.22 percent so far this year.</p>
        <p>But the rest of the market, though firming up on hints that the government might act to cap oil prices and on a Federal Reserve survey showing further slowing of the economy, remained in negative territory.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index lost 8.56 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,451.34, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 101.37 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,687.92 -- 7.04 percent lower than where it started the year.</p>
        <p>Only two of the Dow's 30 components advanced. At its weakest yesterday, the Dow was nearly 222 points lower.</p>
        <p>Referring to the narrowly focused Nasdaq recovery during the day, Ned Riley Jr., chief strategist at State Street Advisors in Boston, said, ''It's clearly concentrated in the top 15 stocks, such as Cisco, Sun, Intel and Dell.'' He said the public, rather than institutions, dominated because transactions of fewer than 1,500 shares accounted for 75 percent of the volume in stocks like Intel.</p>
        <p>Some other stocks bucked the downtrend. Boeing gained $2.29, to $59.06, after it raised its cash-flow estimates for this year, and Lehman Brothers added 75 cents, to $144.44, after reporting sharply higher quarterly profits and a 2-for-1 stock split. Buffalo-based M &amp; T Bank announced a 10-for-1 split and rose $5, to $510.</p>
        <p>Darden Restaurants, owner of Red Lobster and Olive Garden, beat profit estimates for its first quarter and gained $1.25, to $18.56.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Sprint PCS said it expected to add fewer customers than it previously projected and the stock dropped $7.81, to $33, dragging other wireless shares lower, notably VoiceStream and Western, $8.19, and $6.50, respectively.</p>
        <p>Informix, Spartech and TheStreet.com also fell after saying they would miss earnings estimates.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola, with major exposure to currency markets, slumped $4.60, to $49.63.</p>
        <p>''Just a handful of tech stocks led the rebound,'' said Brian G. Belski, strategist at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. ''There's no clearly defined reason to buy'' when so much earnings and other news is expected in the weeks ahead.</p>

        <p>Treasuries Drop</p>
        <p>By Bloomberg News</p>
        <p>Treasury bond prices fell yesterday after a Federal Reserve report citing higher labor costs spurred concern that the central bank's string of interest-rate increases had not done enough to slow growth to a pace that would not lead to faster inflation.</p>
        <p>Government securities also fell as oil prices jumped and Freddie Mac sold $6 billion of new debt, joining dozens of borrowers that will offer about $40 billion of bonds this month.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury note fell 10/32, to a price of 98 31/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.89 percent from 5.85 percent on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 20/32, to 104 4/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.95 percent from 5.91 percent on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Fed's report ''and oil on the rise kept the sell-off going,'' said James Rice, a fixed-income strategist at Stone &amp; Youngberg L.L.C. in San Francisco. ''The market is treacherous to trade,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Traders pulled in bets that the Fed was done raising rates in the current cycle after the central bank's report, which stated ''reports of wage increases were widespread and some firms indicated that higher labor costs were an increasing problem.''</p>
