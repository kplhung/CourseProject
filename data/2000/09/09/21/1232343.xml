        <p>There had never been a 100-meter freestyle like this. Three men had traded the world record in swimming's main event over the last five days, and the eight lanes of water churned so furiously today that they seemed to boil with expectation.</p>
        <p>The women's 200-meter butterfly did not carry the same tense mystery, but it was one of stunning unexpectedness. Misty Hyman of Phoenix took an early lead and, instead of collapsing as she frequently had in the past, produced the biggest upset of the Olympic swim meet: she overcame the defending champion and world-record holder, Susie O'Neill, who is known in her native Australia as Madame Butterfly.</p>
        <p>If the outcome of the 100 freestyle was murky at the midway point, it became crystalline as Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands drew his long, thin form into an inexorable lead. He was the only man to cover the final 50 meters in less than 25 seconds. There had been a look of surprise on his face after he won his first race of the Sydney Olympics, but tonight it was a look of inevitability.</p>
        <p>Ian Thorpe of Australia was supposed to be the swimmer of these Games, but van den Hoogenband has proved himself the best. He has won two gold medals, set two world records and tied a third. He beat Thorpe in the 200 freestyle on Monday, and tonight he defeated the two-time Olympic champion Aleksandr Popov of Russia in the 100 freestyle in 48.30 seconds.</p>
        <p>The time did not match the world record of 47.84 that the Dutchman set in Tuesday's semifinals, but it was more than eight-tenths of a second faster than Popov's time. A world record holder last week, Popov had to settle for silver tonight in 48.69. Gary Hall Jr. of the United States, the 1996 silver medalist who has battled diabetes the last year, took third in 48.73 seconds.</p>
        <p>Tonight's race was so fast that Michael Klim of Australia, who set the 100 freestyle record last Saturday, could not even win a medal, finishing fourth.</p>
        <p>This meet was supposed to be a chlorine war between the United States and Australia, but the Netherlands has appropriated the individual competition. After winning the 100-meter butterfly on Sunday, Inge de Bruijn broke her own world record in tonight's 100-meter freestyle semifinals in 53.77 seconds. She and van den Hoogenband have been collecting world records as if they were Olympic pins.</p>
        <p>Of the 12 world marks set or tied here, they have accounted for 5. They will also be favored in the 50-meter freestyles and could end up with six gold medals between them. Even the reticent van den Hoogenband finally had to concede he was the best.</p>
        <p>''I won two gold medals and broke two world records,'' the 22-year-old van den Hoogenband said. ''Yes, at this moment, I am the best.''</p>
        <p>If the 100 freestyle produced no shock tonight, the 200 butterfly did. Having improved her personal best by four seconds over the last month, Hyman won the gold medal in 2:05.88, while O'Neill finished seven-tenths of a second behind. The crowd of 17,500 at the International Aquatic Center was left incredulous. If any victory seemed certain for O'Neill it was this one, especially since Hyman lacked confidence and nearly gave up the sport as recently as May.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Hyman was a pioneer who spent 30 meters underwater at the beginning of her races, swimming on her side in an undulating motion that she nicknamed the fish kick. In 1998, though, the underwater start was restricted to 15 meters. As she rose to the surface sooner, her self-assurance sank.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't sure I could continue at the elite level without it,'' Hyman said of the fish kick. Four months ago, she said she considered ''throwing in the towel.'' Friends and coaches implored her to continue and she won the Olympic trials in July, but struggled home in the final 50 meters.</p>
        <p>She was overshadowed in her own training pool at Stanford University, where Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres raised much of the attention and expectation before these Games. And even though Thompson won her seventh career gold medal tonight, anchoring the American 4x200-meter freestyle relay team home in 7:57.80, she has never won an individual event. Neither has Torres. It was the youngest swimmer in the group, the 21-year-old Hyman, who produced the first singular triumph.</p>
        <p>While Hyman lacked the reputation of her training partners, she had the same access to the Olympic women's coach, Richard Quick, and to a dozen specialists who helped her with weight training, nutrition, stretching and flexibility. She even had a specialist to massage the toxins out of her lymphatic system.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'O.K., I belong here, I can compete with the best of them,' '' Hyman said.</p>
        <p>She reached the first 50 meters tonight in second place, and moved into the lead at the midway point. Could she hold on? O'Neill did not believe so, but, as Hyman touched the wall for her final turn, she thought to herself, ''I can do this, I can finish this.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill made a final charge, but she had won the 200-meter freestyle on Tuesday, and there was not enough left in her legs tonight.</p>
        <p>''She's known for dying in the last leg,'' O'Neill said of Hyman, ''but good on her, she held it together until the end.''</p>
        <p>Van den Hoogenband maintained the same calm presence in the 100 freestyle to defeat Popov, who had won the 50 and 100 freestyles at the past two Olympics. Once, the Dutchman would have seemed an unlikely Olympic champion. His mother, Astrid, was a former swimmer, but Pieter preferred soccer and field hockey and judo until, at age 11, he went to the pool because his mother was giving lessons.</p>
        <p>''And here I am with a gold medal in my hand,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After the 1992 Summer Olympics, where only two Dutch swimmers reached a final in Barcelona, Spain, van den Hoogenband's parents began a foundation to try to resuscitate the sport. Cees-Rein van den Hoogenband, a trauma surgeon who is the team doctor of the renowned PSV Eindhoven soccer team, asked his wife if there was any talent in the country.</p>
        <p>''Your son and his friends,'' his wife replied.</p>
        <p>Dr. van den Hoogenband raised $30,000 from businessmen associated with the soccer club and hired Jacco Verhaeren as coach of his swimming group. Verhaeren now coaches both de Bruijn and Hoogie, as he is known, in a system that relies on fierce sprint training over 50 and 100 meters instead of the distance work often used in the United States.</p>
        <p>After finishing fourth in the 100 and 200 freestyles at the Atlanta Olympics, van den Hoogenband left the sport briefly but returned with a new resolve, winning six gold medals at the 1999 European championships and defeating Popov twice. He took a leave from medical school to train for the Sydney Games.</p>
        <p>The accomplishments of the Dutch here have inevitably raised suspicions about drug use, but no other swimmers have accused van den Hoogenband. His father said, ''If Pieter takes drugs, I break his legs and he can't swim anymore.''</p>
        <p>''He's probably on the most potent drug there is: hard work,'' said Neil Walker of the United States, who finished fifth tonight. Pieter van den Hoogenband said: ''In swimming we have rules. One of the rules is that you don't take drugs. You want fair competition.''</p>
        <p>He is thin at 6 feet 3 inches, weighing only 174 pounds, and his concave chest reduces drag, like the hull of a catamaran, allowing him to ride high in the water, his father said.</p>
        <p>''He hears a lot of jokes about his build -- they call it a chicken breast,'' Ad Roskam, the Dutch team manager, said. ''He says: 'That is my special thing. That is why I'm a surfboard in the pool.' It is why he doesn't wear a high suit. It would cover his dent.''</p>
        <p>Two gold medals on his chicken breast have made Hoogie a celebrity in the athletes' village. All he wants to do now is party, he said. Not really, Roskam said.</p>
        <p>''He is the guy watching people have fun; that's his fun,'' Roskam said. ''His trick is to pay $25 if you empty a bottle of ketchup on your head.''</p>
