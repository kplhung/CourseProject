        <p>Since the Nets re-signed the veteran Johnny Newman this summer, there is not much room for Mullin as a perimeter player. Even if New Jersey would have gambled on Mullin, he would have been limited in his playing time, much as he was in Indiana this past season.</p>

        <p>The Nets will not be signing the free agent Chris Mullin, the 37-year-old small forward and former St. John's star from Brooklyn whom the Indiana Pacers chose not to re-sign.</p>
        <p>Since the Nets re-signed the veteran Johnny Newman this summer, there is not much room for Mullin as a perimeter player. Even if New Jersey would have gambled on Mullin, he would have been limited in his playing time, much as he was in Indiana this past season.</p>
        <p>Chris is looking at a team where he can get minutes, and where he can win and win big, Nets President Rod Thorn said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Thorn also said the Nets were not likely to be re-signing the free agent Scott Burrell, a 6-foot-7-inch forward who averaged 6.1 points and 3.5 rebounds a game last season coming off the bench. ''He's looking for as much guarantee of playing time that somebody else might be able to give him,'' Thorn said.</p>
        <p>The Nets begin training camp Oct. 3 in their own facility in East Rutherford and Thorn hopes to have just 18 players in camp.</p>
