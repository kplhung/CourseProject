        <p>Verlyn Klinkenborg editorial comment says that although New York is a stylish city, New Yorkers always seem just a little dowdy when Fashion Week shows are taking place in midtown Manhattan (S)</p>

        <p>Soon Fashion Week -- a nine-day week, by the way -- will have come to an end. The huge white tents in Bryant Park will be struck. Burly men driving forklifts and self-propelled cherry-pickers will dismantle the rigging, the wiring, the plywood underfloor that has turned the grass yellow. The self-refreshing web cameras will be taken down, and one will no longer be able to peer into an audience of empty chairs or watch the models slowly strobing down the catwalk.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the 8:15 A.M. crowd rushes past the Fashion Week tents from Port Authority and from the subways in Times Square. People glance at the tents, at the sudden profusion of fashion advertising on the 42nd Street sidewalk, then back to the sidewalk ahead. As always in workaday New York, this is a somberly dressed crowd, safe in black, in blue, in gray. If you listened to the majority of the clothes in the crowd as it passed, you would hear a steady murmur saying, ''I had to put something on.'' We dress in the dark and pretend we know what we look like when we set out for work.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, the 8:15 A.M. crowd rushes past the Fashion Week tents from Port Authority and from the subways in Times Square.

        <p>There is always that strangeness during Fashion Week. Inside the canvas canopy, the fashion-aerialists are putting on their big show, defying gravity, while outside on the sidewalk the echoes of fashions long past and almost forgotten can still be heard. If you stand near the Public Library, watching the rush-hour crowd, you can imagine what it might be like if, for that one block between Sixth Avenue and Fifth, everyone strode like a loosely hinged model, hips swaying, shoulders back. Yet no one does. It's hard to carry a newspaper and a briefcase that way. New York is truly a stylish place, but when Fashion Week comes, the town outside those stark white tents seems just a little dowdy.</p>
