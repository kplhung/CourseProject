        <p>Twenty-four hours earlier, in the same clubhouse, there had been a fiery monologue, stern words from their manager about how they were too good to be playing so badly.</p>
        <p>Tonight, there were smiles and songs and grown men dressed as Superman, Batman and the Jolly Green Giant. For the first time in nine games over the last three Septembers, the Mets had beaten the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field.</p>
        <p>The Braves left the bases loaded three times in the late innings. They made Al Leiter and the Mets earn their 6-3 victory -- and their celebration.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if we wanted to win to beat the Braves,'' said Mets catcher Mike Piazza, who hit a home run, ''or win so we could dress the rookies up.''</p>
        <p>For the first time in a while -- too long, they knew -- the Mets played like superheroes on the field. Tuesday night's speech by Manager Bobby Valentine had the desired effect after two losses in this series.</p>
        <p>''It kind of refreshed our minds,'' said second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo, who had two doubles and a homer. ''It helped. We came in today and said, 'Just play for fun and do what we're able to do.' We had a lot of pressure the first two games, and we didn't deserve to win. They played better than us.</p>
        <p>''He came in last night and told us the truth, that we should play a much better game. We have to believe we have a pretty good team.''</p>
        <p>Valentine believes it, too. Before the game, and for the second year in a row, he intimated to reporters than he should not be rehired if the Mets do not make the playoffs.</p>
        <p>He probably has no reason to worry. The Mets are 86-66, and though they trail the Braves by four games in the National League East, they lead any challenges -- by the Arizona Diamondbacks or the Los Angeles Dodgers -- in the wild-card race comfortably.</p>
        <p>Some players talked of climbing back in the N.L. East race. The Mets play their next four games in Philadelphia and the Braves their next four in Montreal, before Atlanta goes to Shea Stadium for three games next week. ''We still have hopes of trying to win the division,'' center fielder Jay Payton said.</p>
        <p>Simply having one strong showing against their main rival was enough for tonight.</p>
        <p>''Our goal was to come in here and win the series, and it turned from that to not getting swept,'' Piazza said. ''You know what? We accomplished our goal. We were kind of adamant about the fact that we know we are a better team than what we've shown. From a pride standpoint, we just wanted to play a good game.''</p>
        <p>Leiter gave them the chance to do that, pitching out of what could have been a ''here-we-go-again'' spot. The left-hander opened the game with five perfect innings, using his hard stuff and his off-speed pitches effectively for harmless pop-ups and grounders.</p>
        <p>But with one out in the sixth and the Mets leading, 3-0, third baseman Robin Ventura charged but failed to get in front of a grounder by Walt Weiss. It skipped past him for an error, and though Leiter retired the pinch-hitter Bobby Bonilla, he lost a 12-pitch duel with Rafael Furcal, who singled to left after six two-strike fouls to score Weiss.</p>
        <p>''There were some frustrating things happening in that inning that could easily have blown up,'' Leiter said. ''But it didn't.''</p>
        <p>Leiter walked Andruw Jones, and Chipper Jones reached on an infield single. The bases were loaded for Brian Jordan, who hits Leiter well, but Jordan popped to first to end the inning.</p>
        <p>The Mets had built their lead off Tom Glavine (19-9), who had beaten the Mets the last five times he faced them, including in last year's National League Championship Series. A two-out single by Benny Agbayani brought in a run in the first, and Alfonzo and Todd Zeile had bases-empty homers in the sixth.</p>
        <p>The Braves kept coming back. When Leiter gave up two one-out walks in the seventh, followed by two singles, Valentine called for left-hander John Franco. The situation could have been worse that inning, but the rookie left fielder Timo Perez -- later to wear the Batman suit -- astutely threw to second to nab a scrambling Reggie Sanders after a single by Weiss.</p>
        <p>There were two runners on when Franco entered, and he walked Furcal. Then, with the bases loaded, Franco went to 3-0 on Andruw Jones. The Mets lost last year's N.L.C.S. here on a bases-loaded walk, and the 48,278 fans at Turner Field were howling.</p>
        <p>''I didn't revisit that in my mind,'' Valentine said. ''But I can tell you however uncomfortable I was last year, I was just as uncomfortable this year. I sure liked these results better.''</p>
        <p>Franco threw a strike, then got Jones to pop out to right. But Franco created trouble for himself in the eighth when, protecting a 5-2 lead, he gave up a homer to Chipper Jones and a one-out single to Andres Galarraga.</p>
        <p>Armando Benitez entered and issued two walks to load the bases again. But Keith Lockhart popped out and Wally Joyner grounded out, and disaster was averted. Benitez worked a happily uneventful ninth for his 38th save, tying Franco's club record.</p>
        <p>Franco and Benitez have gotten plenty of rest lately as the Mets have struggled to a 7-12 record this month. That, Valentine said, is one positive from an otherwise forgettable stretch. He had confidence that Benitez could get a five-out save, and he did. ''Their touch was a little off,'' Valentine said, ''but they had plenty of bullets left.''</p>
        <p>And the Mets have 10 games left before the postseason, 10 games to shake off their September slide and build much-needed momentum.</p>
        <p>''It's a big win,'' Piazza said. ''If anything, we learned tonight what we can do as a team.''</p>
