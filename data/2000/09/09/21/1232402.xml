        <p>In the latest attempt by Republicans to force Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for United States Senate, to release his personal tax returns, a former federal judge called today on Goldman Sachs Group, Mr. Corzine's former employer, to free him from a confidentiality pact that Mr. Corzine says prevents him from doing so.</p>
        <p>Herbert J. Stern, who spent 13 years on the federal bench in Newark after serving as United States attorney for New Jersey in the early 1970's, said in a letter to Henry M. Paulson Jr., who succeeded Mr. Corzine as Goldman's chairman, that the ''extraordinary circumstances'' of Mr. Corzine's candidacy justified such a move.</p>
        <p>''I cannot know, of course, what there can be, if anything, in this financial information which could possibly prejudice your firm, which itself is publicly held,'' Mr. Stern wrote in a letter dated Thursday and released at a news conference here today. ''I do know, however, that the lack of this information is prejudicial to the informed judgment of the voting public.</p>
        <p>''Weighing these interests in the balance,'' Mr. Stern concluded, ''I hope that you will agree that the public interest here is paramount, and I therefore respectfully request that you permit the people of New Jersey access to this information about a candidate for the office of United States senator.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Paulson was traveling today and could not be reached. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to respond on his behalf.</p>
        <p>The issue of his tax returns has been a particularly vexing one for Mr. Corzine, who has been unable to make it go away despite months of trying. When the subject came up in his Democratic primary battle with former Gov. Jim Florio, Mr. Corzine said he asked executives at Goldman to allow him to release his returns, but was turned down.</p>
        <p>When he came under mounting pressure from Mr. Florio, Mr. Corzine asked the firm to let him disclose a range of information -- from the innocuous, like the total number of pages in his tax return, to a list of the forms and schedules in his return, or a copy of his return omitting any sensitive information. Again, the firm said no.</p>
        <p>And when reporters pressed Mr. Corzine to produce the confidentiality agreement itself, to refute Mr. Florio's speculation that he was using Goldman Sachs as a straw man, Mr. Corzine replied that the firm had turned him down again. The secrecy agreement, he said, even applied to itself.</p>
        <p>In the last few weeks, Mr. Corzine's Republican opponent, Representative Bob Franks, has revived Mr. Florio's line of attack and made it the focus of his campaign. It has won him helpful headlines in the state's newspapers at a time when Mr. Corzine is spending more each week for television commercials than Mr. Franks has managed to raise since June.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Corzine caved in to pressure from Mr. Franks on a related matter and published his charitable contributions for the last two years. His records revealed that Mr. Corzine had given more than $100,000 to groups whose leaders or sponsors later endorsed him, and that Mr. Corzine had been less than completely candid when asked in April whether he had made such donations.</p>
        <p>On the subject of releasing his tax returns, however, Mr. Corzine has shown no sign of movement -- or perhaps more precisely, no sign that he expects his former colleagues at Goldman Sachs might budge from their earlier refusals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine has made the issue somewhat more confusing in recent weeks; his spokesman, Tom Shea, who says he has never seen the confidentiality agreement or Mr. Corzine's tax returns, at one point said Mr. Corzine would be freed from the pact at the end of this year. He later said he had been misunderstood.</p>
        <p>Efforts to clarify that point, or anything else that would shed light on Mr. Corzine's confidentiality agreement, were met with congenial nonresponses from Mr. Shea today. Asked when and in what context Mr. Corzine signed the pact, and its duration; whether it explicitly mentioned tax returns; and what the penalties were for violating the agreement, Mr. Shea checked with Mr. Corzine's lawyer and then would not comment, saying Goldman Sachs would have to answer such questions.</p>
        <p>Those questions were put to Goldman Sachs today, along with a few others, like: What harm there could be in releasing Mr. Corzine from the pact, especially since the firm is no longer a partnership, but a public company?</p>
        <p>But a spokesman for the firm again would not comment.</p>
        <p>At his news conference today, Mr. Stern, the former judge, said he had been asked by a lawyer for Mr. Franks to weigh in on the subject but noted that although he is a Republican, he was not motivated by partisan politics. As evidence of his independence, he said he had been the Democratic appointee to a legislative commission that investigated contracts for automobile inspection stations and the E-ZPass system.</p>
        <p>''I don't doubt Mr. Corzine's word, when he says he has a contract,'' Mr. Stern said. But he said Mr. Corzine should have realized in advance that running for Senate today requires the fullest financial disclosure. ''If I can't meet those conditions, then I don't enter that arena,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A somewhat beleaguered Mr. Shea responded today that if Goldman Sachs ''would grant Herb Stern's request, I'd be the happiest guy in the world.''</p>
        <p>''Jon would much prefer that Goldman release him from this agreement, so he can get his tax returns out, put this behind him, and focus on Bob Franks's voting record,'' he added. ''We hope Herb Stern has better luck than we did. He's got a great idea -- such a great idea that Jon had it six months ago.''</p>
