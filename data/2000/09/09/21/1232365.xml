        <p>SOME might be scandalized to hear that a fellow could win an election with a criminal indictment hanging over his head, but to hear Pedro Espada Jr., a Democratic candidate for the State Senate from the Bronx, tell it, his victory in the primary last week was a beautiful thing.</p>
        <p>''It has a lot do with 20 years of being here, present in almost every aspect of this community's life as a native son of the South Bronx,'' explains Mr. Espada, a charming man with choirboy eyes, which one would be inclined to fall trustingly into were it not for his impending trial on charges of second-degree grand larceny. ''The people that I grew up with I still encounter in the street; my fourth-grade teacher and I are still in touch. They understand that I'm a political independent, but mostly they trust me and know me from my delivery of human services.''</p>

        <p>SOME might be scandalized to hear that a fellow could win an election with a criminal indictment hanging over his head, but to hear Pedro Espada Jr., a Democratic candidate for the State Senate from the Bronx, tell it, his victory in the primary last week was a beautiful thing.</p>
        <p>''It has a lot do with 20 years of being here, present in almost every aspect of this community's life as a native son of the South Bronx,'' explains Mr. Espada, a charming man with choirboy eyes, which one would be inclined to fall trustingly into were it not for his impending trial on charges of second-degree grand larceny. ''The people that I grew up with I still encounter in the street; my fourth-grade teacher and I are still in touch. They understand that I'm a political independent, but mostly they trust me and know me from my delivery of human services.''</p>
        <p>What a likable fellow Mr. Espada is, even with that pesky indictment, which involves a charge that four years ago he used $221,000 from the Universal Health Plan, a health maintenance organization for Medicaid patients, to help finance the political campaigns of him and his son.</p>
        <p>Privately, even Mr. Espada's opponents acknowledge that he is far more articulate than the candidate he defeated, the incumbent, Senator David Rosado. Both men ran intense campaigns, but Mr. Espada, 46, who owns six health centers in the Bronx, must be credited with gallantry: on the morning of the primary, he was at the Hunts Point subway station, handing roses to women. He had to do this very early, he notes, as he had to appear in court, a scheduling problem he attributes to his enemies.</p>
        <p>He also insists that his case is not, as the Bronx district attorney's office maintains, about $220,000 in stolen Medicaid funds, but about the laws regarding campaign contributions.</p>
        <p>''They happened to criminalize my case because they had a friendly D.A.,'' Mr. Espada says. ''The number is right, but everything else about this case stinks to high heaven.''</p>
        <p>The intrigues of the 32nd District: Mr. Espada, who won a seat in the State Senate in 1992 and lost it four years later, has feuded with the Bronx Democratic Party for the last few years. In 1996, he and his son, Pedro Gautier Espada, who was then running for an Assembly seat and is today on the City Council, were thrown off the ballot for campaign irregularities. Two years ago, Mr. Espada and two associates were indicted on the latest charges, which carry a maximum of 15 years.</p>
        <p>MR. ESPADA insists the charges are politically motivated. He buoys that argument with a videotaped conversation between his son and Mr. Rosado two years ago -- Pedro Gautier Espada secretly recorded it -- in which Mr. Rosado seems to suggest that if the elder Mr. Espada did not run for office, he might avoid prosecution. It takes no coaxing at all, up at his office at the Soundview Health Center on White Plains Road, for Mr. Espada to roll that video.</p>
        <p>On that tape, Mr. Rosado says, ''If you run, there will be a case regardless, even if it's'' -- here Mr. Rosado uses a vulgarity. ''But it will tie you up.''</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Espada and Mr. Rosado are suing each other for slander. Mr. Espada is also suing both the Bronx Democratic and Republican Parties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada came to the South Bronx from Puerto Rico when he was 5. His father had been wounded and disabled in the Korean War and turned to drink; his mother supported her large family on welfare.</p>
        <p>''The serpent side of me comes from my father, the dove comes from my mother,'' Mr. Espada says. ''She's calming, she's an angel. My father left the house for the last time when I was 14, and I became the head of the family in many ways.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada gets a scholarship to Syracuse University, is a father at 19, and graduates from Fordham University. He teaches, is a social worker and becomes involved in community politics and health care after moving into the Stevenson Commons housing project.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada starts Soundview with a federal grant of less than $100,000. Today, there are 300 employees and Mr. Espada, the president, is paid $197,000 a year. In 1994, he also founded the Universal Health Plan, which was financed with city and state money.</p>
        <p>Ask Mr. Espada why public funds earmarked for poor people were going into his campaign and he goes into his pretrial mantra:</p>
        <p>''Is Universal Health Plan's ability to contribute to politics any different from any other not-for-profit that is currently financing millions in political campaigns? We are talking about criminal charges and the law, and I am asking: what is permissible under not-for-profits by way of political campaigns? That answer will be convincingly, unequivocally, clear one minute after my acquittal. And then the question I want to ask is: why? Why damage my credibility and all of what I have done in this borough?''</p>
        <p>Fast forward:</p>
        <p>''I've forgiven them all, because I've been vindicated.''</p>
        <p>Does that mean Mr. Espada will be dropping his lawsuits?</p>
        <p>Apparently not.</p>
        <p>''This corporation, which has never run for public office, has been vilified and defamed. Me, as an individual, I will forgive, but as president of the company, I am responsible for 300 people, and if their corporation is defamed, if they can't get a doctor to work in an indigent community, that's a little different than picking on Pedro Espada.''</p>
