        <p>TEENAGE angst is nothing. To understand real pain, consider the grown man trying to buy a big-screen television in the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Few give the television set purchase its due. People think cars and houses are bigger purchase decisions, yet they trade in their cars every three years and switch homes every seven. Compared with that, buying a television set is a much longer-term emotional commitment. My old 19-inch Sony Trinitron outlasted nine cars and five homes -- it moved out to California with us and back home to New York -- in a 20-year career of crisply perfect pictures and total color saturation. It failed only when our 9-year-old son accidentally knocked it from its perch, about five feet off the floor.</p>
        <p>Having always been a movie lover, I began to miss them sorely when baby sitters became extinct shortly after our triplets were born in 1991. Video rentals are O.K., but have two problems: picture and sound. It's torture watching wide-screen movies on regular television screens. I squirm and groan about all the picture I'm missing and the inability of the almost-square screen to deliver the ''director's vision.'' In occasional fits of  pique over particularly bad ''pan and scan'' conversions, I even shut off the TV.</p>
        <p>I feel similarly about the pale ghost of a movie soundtrack that most TV's can deliver, and pumping the sound through my big old wooden stereo speakers is much better but not quite good enough.</p>
        <p>The answer to my problems, of course, is a home theater with a big-screen TV and real movie-house-quality, rib-breaking surround sound. But a decade ago, mere mortals couldn't afford a worthwhile home theater system, and besides, access to widescreen movies was rare in that pre-DVD era.</p>
        <p>Now, it appears, all the pieces are there and affordable. Wide-screen versions of just about everything are available on DVD, surround sound is cheap, and even the prices of big-screen high-definition televisions are plummeting.</p>
        <p>And there's the rub.</p>
        <p>Any thinking person who tries to make an intelligent purchase in the realm of big-screen TV right now must end up like me: desolate, inconsolable, barking angrily at my wife when she dares speak to me and muttering to myself in dark corners of the living room in ways that frighten the children. We are all victims of a giant conspiracy -- or gross incompetence, I can't decide which -- perpetrated by manufacturers, broadcasters, politicians and the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
        <p>Here's the essence of the problem for the man on the street with a credit card burning a hole in his pocket. Old-fashioned analog televisions sets, the kind that we all have in our living rooms, bedrooms and playrooms, are officially dead. By F.C.C. mandate, broadcasters must be transmitting their programming via high-definition digital signals by 2006. You'll undoubtedly find analog broadcasts for a few years after that, but not many.</p>
        <p>So the first circle of this particular hell is the analog versus digital question. Analog televisions, like Sony's flat-screen Wega, are at the pinnacle of their art, inexpensive in comparison with digital TV's and liable to last a lifetime. But analog signals may not be around for that lifetime. Digital TV's exhibit extraordinary picture quality when rendering images from a digital signal, but there aren't very many digital signals around yet and there's no telling when there will be, despite the F.C.C. mandate.</p>
        <p>Digital televisions are also expensive and have many bugs yet to be worked out. In all the product reviews, for instance, you can read about ''digital artifacts,'' which are basically anything from nearly invisible little bursts of seemingly random color on the screen to seizures of the entire image's motion.</p>
        <p>''But wait,'' I thought. ''I want this big-screen digital TV to watch movies. I'll simply pair it with a DVD player, which delivers the digital signal right into the set.''</p>
        <p>And we bump up against the next circle of hell: aspect ratio. It is deceptively simple at first. High-definition digital TV's come in the rectangular 16:9 aspect ratio; old-fashioned televisions come in the more square 4:3 aspect ratio. The set I've had my eye on recently, the Mitsubishi Platinum Plus WS55807, has a rear-projection, high-definition, 55-inch (diagonal) TV screen with a 16:9 aspect ratio. It's specially enhanced to show DVD movies.</p>
        <p>I was agog at the Mitsubishi's enhancements, having personally driven crazy the sales manager at a local electronics store by making him shift his DVD player around among a half-dozen sets, showing multiple movies on each. So why not buy this magical movie machine and then, when we want to watch regular analog TV, we'll just watch it in its 4:3 aspect ratio in the middle of the Mitsubishi's theater-size screen. It will still be a bigger picture than our current 26-inch living-room set.</p>
        <p>Then I saw it. It was a sign on the floor model. For brevity's sake, I'll paraphrase it: You can't watch regular analog TV in the middle of the screen for more than 15 percent of your viewing time, or you'll ruin the screen. You'll get little ghost images of blank bars on the parts of the screen where there was no image. For myself, I could make the 15 percent argument, since I expect to watch  movies and little else. But who are we kidding? The three 9-year-olds are going to be the primary users of the television, and judging by this sign, they'll destroy it in a month.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers of high-definition TV's have tried to skirt the problem by offering various special screen ''modes,'' all of which amount to some stretching, scrunching or  otherwise fouling up of the geometry of the analog picture so that it will fit the wide-screen shape. It makes everything you watch look like you're at a really bad circus.</p>
        <p>Reluctantly, I tore myself away from the WS55807 and set my sights on its 4:3 aspect ratio cousin, a 50-inch (diagonal) model that had essentially the same high-definition specs but with a square screen. I reasoned that I'd trade off a little bit in size for the movies I wanted to watch, but normal TV would fill the whole screen (until 2006 -- ouch!), so the triplets couldn't really hurt it. My wide-screen movies would probably account for around 15 percent of the viewing time, so the black or gray bars wouldn't ''burn'' the screen. It wasn't a perfect solution. But we're living in a difficult transition period, I reasoned, so it would have to do.</p>
        <p>The hard-working sales manager plugged his DVD player showing a wide-screen movie into the 4:3 television and my world collapsed. The picture was all scrunched up in the middle of the screen. Nothing either one of us did would get the movie to show properly.</p>
        <p>Experts say DVD players have a switch to let them know whether they're connected to a wide-screen or a 4:3 television, so that they can provide the correct picture. But on that day with that particular DVD player, we just couldn't get it to work.</p>
        <p>I am, for now, a broken man. Desolate, inconsolable, off muttering in the corner of the living room. The kids approach me cautiously. I watch DVD movies on a 26-inch TV that looks like 15 or so inches when you display the whole wide-screen movie frame. My wife and I squint from the loveseat, 14 feet away.</p>
        <p>I nearly bought one of those 36-inch analog Sony Wegas. ''Last gasp of the analog world,'' I told myself. ''It's a work of art, a classic, the best analog picture ever created.'' But it can't make me happy. It's not quite big enough for watching movies in our room. And every time I looked at it, I'd be reminded of the last six weeks of research and analysis and utter failure.</p>
        <p>And I'd be bitter.</p>
