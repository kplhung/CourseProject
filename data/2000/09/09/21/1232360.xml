        <p>In what is expected to spur further consolidation among European utilities, RWE  A.G., a German energy and environmental concern, is nearing an agreement to acquire Thames Water P.L.C., of Britain for $:4.3 billion or about $6 billion, people close to the discussions said today.</p>
        <p>RWE, which is about to complete a merger with a German rival, VEW, has said it will use its 30 billion euro war chest, or about $25.5 billion, to expand throughout Europe. In addition to energy and environmental activities, RWE runs waste management operations and water utilities in 120 countries, although it currently has no operations in Britain.</p>
        <p>Thames Water has been eliminating jobs in Britain and expanding abroad -- most recently buying the New Jersey utility E'Town Corporation for about $1 billion -- after British regulators cut water prices by 12 percent this year. Prices over the next four years will be allowed to rise in line with inflation.</p>
        <p>Word of a possible RWE deal for Thames pushed up the British company's share price by 26 percent today to 1,153 pence, or about $16.14. RWE shares fell 3.9 percent, to 39.5 euros, or about $33.58.</p>
        <p>Thames Water's sheer size in Britain, where it has about 12 million customers, would make it attractive to a foreign player looking to gain a foothold, analysts said.</p>
        <p>''It's a good deal,'' said Verity Mitchell, an analyst with HSBC Securities, who rates Thames shares a buy. ''Thames fills a gap in RWE's existing armory.''</p>
        <p>The deal, which is expected to be all cash, could be announced as soon as Monday. As part of the deal, RWE would assume $:2.4 billion of Thames Water's debt, the people close to the negotiations said. At a 13 percent premium to Thames Water's asset value of $:3.8 billion, the current offer is fair, several analysts said.</p>
        <p>Thames Water issued a statement today confirming that it was in ''advanced discussions'' with an unnamed bidder, but a spokesman declined to comment further. Executives from RWE declined to comment.</p>
        <p>The British company is expected to be the first of several utilities in the country to be snapped up by foreign buyers, since British regulators have said that any benefits from mergers between British utilities must be passed to consumers, rather than to shareholders.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mitchell noted that E.ON A.G.,  would probably be interested in acquiring a British utility, possibly United Utilities P.L.C., or Anglian Water P.L.C.</p>
