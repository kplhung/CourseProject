        <p>THE nation's pizza peddlers, stung by a recent sluggishness in sales, are stepping up their already frenetic advertising, marketing and promotional efforts.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the pizza business is so intensely competitive these days that decisions made in the courtroom seem to loom just as large as those made in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>''This summer has been soft for pizza,'' said Cheryl Bachelder, executive vice president for marketing and product development at Domino's Pizza in Ann Arbor, Mich., owned by Bain Capital and senior managers. The reasons range from unseasonable weather in many parts of the country to consumers deciding to eat more meals away from home.</p>
        <p>''The category has been a little slow in the last few months,'' said Randy Gier, chief marketing officer at Pizza Hut in Dallas, the market leader that is part of Tricon Global Restaurants. ''We expected it to be a little stronger.''</p>
        <p>To stimulate interest in their doughy, cheesy concoctions, Domino's, which is No. 2, and Pizza Hut are running dueling campaigns centered on television commercials appearing during the NBC coverage of the Olympics.</p>
        <p>Domino's is expanding a campaign focused on product attributes that features Andy, a naughty puppet-like character.</p>
        <p>The creature, designed by Henson Productions, which created the Muppets, ''is a way to educate people about what we call our 'zealous pizza-making process,' '' said Donny Deutsch, chairman and chief executive at Deutsch Inc. in New York, Domino's agency. The campaign's theme is: ''Bad Andy. Good pizza.''</p>
        <p>Meantime, Pizza Hut plans to spend $40 million on a multimedia campaign to introduce its latest pizza creation, called the Insider. Insider will make its debut formally on Sunday after a weeklong teaser campaign that asks, ''What is Pizza Hut trying to hide?''</p>
        <p>Pizza Hut also figured in a decision late Tuesday by a federal appeals court that overturned much of a ruling that would have required Papa John's International -- the No. 4 pizza purveyor, just behind Little Caesars -- to stop using its longtime slogan ''Better ingredients, better pizza.''</p>
        <p>The decision was the most recent in a two-year battle pitting Pizza Hut against Papa John's, which has aggressively tweaked Pizza Hut in campaigns featuring John Schnatter, the founder and chief executive of Papa John's. That tactic has often helped to increase sales for a company fighting a far larger competitor.</p>
        <p>''We've got the lawyers poring over the ruling,'' Mr. Gier said, adding that Pizza Hut was considering an appeal.</p>
        <p>Usually, Pizza Hut is more interested in making news through products rather than legal procedures.</p>
        <p>''If you look back at the pizza category over the last 10 years, what sparks sales is new products,'' said Charlie Miesmer, vice chairman at the principal Pizza Hut agency, BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. ''If people can experience the basic taste of a pizza in a new way, they consider it cool and fun.''</p>
        <p>The Insider -- a stacked, thin-crust offering to be promoted as a ''pizza inside a pizza'' -- joins recent additions to the Pizza Hut menu like the Edge, introduced in 1997, and revamped in April, and the Big New Yorker, brought out last year. Executives at Pizza Hut undoubtedly hope the Insider fares better at the cash register than the 1999 movie of the same name did at the box office.</p>
        <p>''It's not that people are less interested in pizza,'' Mr. Gier said. ''It's just that no one in the category has done anything that has hit the hot button.''</p>
        <p>Along with BBDO New York, the agencies developing the Insider campaign are TLP in Dallas, an Omnicom sibling, for print, and BBDO Houston, for radio. The TV spots from BBDO New York show the Insider being assembled and offer exaggerated vignettes of getting more inside something than expected: an elephant is stuffed into a telephone booth and four sumo wrestlers are squeezed inside a photo-taking booth.</p>
        <p>''It is not a serious product,'' Mr. Miesmer said. ''We need novel devices, something that would get the average 16-year-old to look up and pay attention.''</p>
        <p>At Domino's, Andy's antics are also intended to be humorous, as the character is shown hindering attempts by Domino's employees to prepare and deliver hot, fresh pies.</p>
        <p>Andy is ''not mean or evil,'' Ms. Bachelder said. ''He does things that maybe a little boy would do,'' like trying to make pizzas by duplicating a photograph in a copier.</p>
        <p>''Andy is a mischievous foil to the people who work at our stores,'' she added, ''which gives us a way to reveal who we are and what we do for the customer without pounding our own chests.''</p>
        <p>The decision involving Papa John's was closely watched because it dealt with a chest-pounding ad concept known as puffery, or vague claims of superiority that many advertisers have traditionally used in campaigns. Pizza Hut executives insisted the slogan was misleading and harmful to their business and sued Papa John's in 1998.</p>
        <p>While the slogan, used along with certain ads about pizza sauce and dough, ''conveyed objectifiable and misleading facts,'' the appeals court ruled, the slogan was not misleading by itself. As a result, the lower court's ruling was set aside.</p>
        <p>Papa John's, based in Louisville, Ky., considered itself vindicated by the appeals court decision, Syl Sosnowski, vice president for marketing, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>For those wondering why the Domino's character was named Andy, Mr. Deutsch had this explanation: ''If we did 'Bad Morty. Good pizza,' I don't know if it would have worked.''</p>
