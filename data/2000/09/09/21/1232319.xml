        <p>Heartbreak was played for tears and then for defiant laughs when two of Mexico's reigning pop stars, Ana Gabriel and Juan Gabriel, shared a double bill at Madison Square Garden on Sunday night. It was an efficient marathon show: two 100-minute sets separated by a 5-minute band changeover.</p>
        <p>The two singers, who are not related, are longtime hit-makers: Ms. Gabriel since the mid-1980's, Mr. Gabriel since the early 1970's. Like other top Mexican singers, they have both run two-track careers. Between albums of contemporary pop, they also make albums with more traditional accompaniment by mariachi bands, bandas (brass bands) or, on Ms. Gabriel's latest album, an acoustic bolero ensemble. At Madison Square Garden, each singer led two bands: a pop orchestra and a glittering, sombrero-topped mariachi group.</p>

        <p>Heartbreak was played for tears and then for defiant laughs when two of Mexico's reigning pop stars, Ana Gabriel and Juan Gabriel, shared a double bill at Madison Square Garden on Sunday night. It was an efficient marathon show: two 100-minute sets separated by a 5-minute band changeover.</p>
        <p>The two singers, who are not related, are longtime hit-makers: Ms. Gabriel since the mid-1980's, Mr. Gabriel since the early 1970's. Like other top Mexican singers, they have both run two-track careers. Between albums of contemporary pop, they also make albums with more traditional accompaniment by mariachi bands, bandas (brass bands) or, on Ms. Gabriel's latest album, an acoustic bolero ensemble. At Madison Square Garden, each singer led two bands: a pop orchestra and a glittering, sombrero-topped mariachi group.</p>
        <p>Love is a perennial tragedy in Ms. Gabriel's lovesick, lonely songs. The man she adores is cold or out of reach or deceitful; she knows that loving him is madness, but she can't help herself. Her greatest pain, she declares, has always come from falling in love. And she confesses her suffering in a voice that's never at peace.</p>
        <p>Her songs become sweeping vocal dramas, whether they are international-style diva anthems, marching slowly toward grand choruses, or gently bouncing mariachi rancheras and waltzes. When she sings quietly, her voice has only a hint of grit; as the lyrics reveal deeper loneliness and yearning, the grit turns into a rasp and then a racking, breaking, inconsolable sob. Some songs build slowly to desperate, dolorous peaks; others sweep up and down, in arguments between head and heart.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gabriel didn't play the tragic heroine between songs. She put on a New York Yankees cap provided by an audience member and she welcomed another Mexican star, Veronica Castro, to sing a few songs. But with the first notes of each song, she was back in character.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gabriel's voice cut through the tinkling sheen of her mini-orchestra's arrangements, but it was even more striking in more traditional arrangements: grieving against the calmly plucked backdrop of a bolero, rising to meet her horn section's simulation of a brass band or pleading against the courtly admonitions of trumpets and violins with the mariachi band. She wasn't entirely a victim of love, either. After she sang about a cheating man who wanted a second chance, cheers arose when she finally told him, ''Es demasiado tarde'' -- ''It's too late.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gabriel took affairs of the heart more lightly.  He was a puckish figure onstage -- part Tom Jones, part Liberace -- with a teasing smile, an occasional hip wiggle and some surprisingly graceful dance steps. Singing about an unfaithful lover, he turned cuckoldry into comedy, mocking his rival as an imbecile and making rude gestures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gabriel moved quickly through a more or less chronological selection of his hits beginning in 1971. At one point he paused and said, ''Which year was I up to?''</p>
        <p>His early hits reflected north-of-the-border pop, smoothing out 1950's rock the way Loggins and Messina did, and he held his voice back to sound like a modest pop croon. But there's a heart-on-sleeve Mexican tenor within him and it came out soon enough. Mr. Gabriel made his voice rougher and heartier, particularly in the songs with the mariachi band; even in the keyboard-laden ballads, he carried his vows of love up to wide-open high notes. The audience sang along on every song, savoring unabashedly sentimental romantic memories. As one of his hits ended, Mr. Gabriel traced a heart in the air.</p>
