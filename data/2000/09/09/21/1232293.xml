        <p>A TECHNOGEL place mat made with fabric scraps and a bright chartreuse straw mat are a far cry from their plain-Jane cousins. This fall, designers are using new materials and reworking old standbys to create interesting ways to protect, as well as decorate, the dinner table.</p>
        <p>1. Rubber circles-within-circles come in contrasting combinations of colors ($15.95 each). The inner circle can be used as a coaster or a napkin ring. At Mxyplyzyk, 125 Greenwich Avenue (13th Street).</p>

        <p>A TECHNOGEL place mat made with fabric scraps and a bright chartreuse straw mat are a far cry from their plain-Jane cousins. This fall, designers are using new materials and reworking old standbys to create interesting ways to protect, as well as decorate, the dinner table.</p>
