        <p>''Made in California,'' an exhibition opening next month at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, developed from three years of discussion and debate over what represents 20th-century California by curators from the museum, exhibition designers, historians and art and architecture critics. The show, meant to celebrate the turn of the millennium and the 150th anniversary of statehood, examines California's image in the popular and fine arts, architecture, decorative arts and ephemera. Included will be Ray Eames's cover for the May 1945 issue of Arts &amp; Architecture (left) and a 1936 chair and ottoman (inset), designed by R. M. Schindler for the never-built Shep House. Information: (323) 857-6000.</p>
