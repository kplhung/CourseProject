        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he wanted to build a domed indoor-outdoor arena on the West Side of Manhattan that would seat up to 100,000 people for major concerts, conventions and sports events. His plans were supported for the first time by Gov. George E. Pataki, who controls the agency that owns the land.</p>
        <p>''We're interested in moving forward with this,'' said Zenia Mucha, a senior adviser to Mr. Pataki, who said the governor wanted the plans to include the expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani left open the possibility yesterday that the arena could be used by the  Jets, the New York Yankees, the New York Mets or the Olympics in 2012. But he said he wanted to build the arena, on a site from 30th to 34th Street on the West Side, regardless of whether he had commitments from the International Olympic Committee or the football and baseball teams.</p>
        <p>''I'm open to all ideas, not closed to any,'' Mr. Giuliani said during a news conference in the City Hall Blue Room. ''And I'm willing to put together whatever group will get me that large, domed, indoor arena. If that includes getting the Jets back, that would be wonderful. If it doesn't, and we still build the stadium, we can justify it. If it solves the Yankee problem or the Met problem or some other, those are all tangental to it. The main thing is getting the domed indoor arena.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has wanted to build a stadium on the West Side for years and is negotiating now with Jets officials. But his remarks yesterday were quickly taken as a positive development by other parties who want space on the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>Members of NYC 2012, the local Olympic committee that has been working with the Jets on a potential West Side stadium that could be used for football and the Olympics, said the mayor's comments were consistent with their plans. The mayor proposed such a stadium in his State of the City speech in January. That same month Robert Wood Johnson IV bought the Jets and said he was looking for a new home for the football team.</p>
        <p>But representatives of the Yankees embraced the mayor's words yesterday as a revival of a proposed $1 billion West Side stadium for the Yankees, an idea vigorously promoted by the mayor in 1996 but beaten down by opposition from city residents, politicians and most community leaders on the West Side.</p>
        <p>''It certainly leaves open an option of a baseball stadium,'' said Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Yankees. ''Everything is possible because it's an excellent location.'' Although George M. Steinbrenner, the chief owner of the Yankees, has been publicly quiet on the subject in recent months, local real estate and planning officials say that he has complained that a West Side stadium should be his, not Mr. Johnson's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki had long been skeptical of a West Side stadium for the Yankees, and has said they should remain in the Bronx. It was unclear why Mr. Giuliani suddenly left a door open for the Yankees yesterday.</p>
        <p>Recently the Jets hired Peter F. Powers, a former deputy mayor and a close friend of Mr. Giuliani's, as a consultant to help them find a new home. They have also hired Kieran Mahoney, a political consultant who is a friend of Mr. Pataki's.</p>
        <p>Even as Mr. Giuliani spoke enthusiastically of the stadium, opponents were assembling for a news conference near the City Hall steps. ''Mayor Giuliani is obsessed with stadiums,'' said Thomas K. Duane, a state senator whose district is on the West Side. ''At any given time, he has half a dozen stadiums on the drawing board.''</p>
        <p>Others at the news conference included Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, and a City Council member, Christine C. Quinn. One opponent held a sign that said, ''We love the Jets in Queens or Long Island.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani dismissed the opposition. ''They're against everything!'' he said at his news conference. ''Come on, everything I've done they're against. I mean, it's almost a signal to me it's the right idea.''</p>
        <p>The opponents are only one hurdle. Mr. Giuliani also needs the cooperation of the Javits Center as well as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that owns the land. Part of the Olympics committee proposal includes new rail stations in the area that would extend service on Metro-North Railroad, the Long Island Rail Road and the No. 7 subway line.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that the city and the M.T.A. had worked out an agreement to extend the No. 7 line west of Times Square but that it needed final approval. ''That's always been our position,'' said Tom Kelly, the press secretary to the M.T.A. ''That we would look at it and do it to coincide with the overall development of the West Side.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said he wanted the arena to have a retractable roof. ''It would be open so that you could play football there on the good days,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''You could close it, not only for football, but for a second purpose, that would have tremendous economic benefit for the city.'' He added that the city was losing ''hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars'' because it lacked a big indoor stadium.</p>
        <p>''What we need is a place where 50,000 to 100,000 people can sit down indoors and watch something, a concert, a convention, a show,'' Mr. Giuliani said, noting that Madison Square Garden holds only 20,000 people. He added that a large indoor arena would allow the city to compete for events like the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani admitted that his plans were still ''all in the discussion and proposal stage'' but said he was not going to back down under what would almost certainly be enormous neighborhood opposition. ''You've got to keep challenging all the people that sit there saying, 'Ah, can't be done, you can't do it, you shouldn't do it,' '' he said. ''Those are the people that were killing the city.''</p>
