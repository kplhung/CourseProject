        <p>After three legs of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay tonight, the United States was in danger of not defending its Olympic title.</p>
        <p>As Jenny Thompson dived into the pool, the Americans were trailing slightly behind Australia. After finishing a disappointing fifth in the 100-meter butterfly at these Sydney Games, Thompson might have been dispirited. Instead, she set an Olympic record with her anchor split in 1 minute 59.35 seconds, and the United States won another gold medal in the event in 7:57.80.</p>
        <p>By the time Thompson touched the wall, she was seven-tenths of a second ahead of Petria Thomas of Australia. The Americans now have eight gold medals in swimming, doubling the Australian total.</p>
        <p>''It was pretty sweet,'' Thompson said. ''It was nerve-racking because it was neck and neck. I saw Petria and just put my head down in the last 25 meters.''</p>
        <p>The victory gave Thompson the seventh gold medal of her career, the most by an American woman in any Olympic sport. Next is Bonnie Blair, who won five gold medals in speedskating. The one unfulfilled aspect of Thompson's celebrated career is that all her gold medals have come in relays. Her last chance at an individual gold will come Thursday night in the 100 freestyle. She plans to retire to enter medical school at Columbia University next August.</p>
        <p>Over all, Thompson now has eight Olympic medals, tying her with the swimmers Shirley Babashoff of the United States and Cornelia Ender of the former East Germany. However, an individual gold is very likely to remain elusive. Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands has become the world's dominant sprinter. She set a world record tonight in the semifinals of the 100 freestyle in 53.77 seconds. Thompson hung on de Bruijn's shoulder the entire race but finished behind in 54.40 seconds.</p>
        <p>A flurry of world records this year has raised suspicion in the swimming world about potential drug use by de Bruijn. She has denied it. And tonight, when asked if he believed that de Bruijn was clean, Thompson's coach, Richard Quick, said, ''I'm going to presume she is unless something were to change that.''</p>
        <p>He did not have the same ameliorating words for China's Zhuang Yong, who defeated Thompson in the 100 freestyle at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain. More than three dozen Chinese swimmers have since been caught taking drugs.</p>
        <p>''I know she was cheated out of an individual gold by a Chinese woman,'' Quick said. ''That's too bad. But in my mind, Jenny Thompson is one of the greatest swimmers in the history of women's swimming. She won two world championships and held two world records. An individual gold she would love to have, but that doesn't diminish Jenny Thompson at all.''</p>
