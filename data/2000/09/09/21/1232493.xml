        <p>Lisa Fernandez relived her worst softball nightmare here this afternoon, when she surrendered a two-out, two-run home run to Australia, sending the United States women to a demoralizing 2-1 defeat in 13 innings in the preliminary Olympic tournament.</p>
        <p>Petra Edebone connected on a blast over the left-field fence, just as Fernandez appeared ready to close out a brilliant, record-breaking 25-strikeout performance. Instead, the United States lost its third straight game -- the first time that has happened in 35 years of international play.</p>
        <p>Before Edebone hit the home run, Fernandez had retired Joanne Brown for the second out; Sally McCreedy, the base runner automatically assigned to second base from the 10th inning on, moved to third. It was Brown who had homered off Hernandez in almost the same situation during the Atlanta Olympics, breaking up her perfect game in the 10th inning for a 2-1 Australia victory. In that game, as in today's, the winning pitcher for Australia was Tanya Harding.</p>
        <p>That was the only game the United States lost on its way to a gold medal. Now 2-3 in preliminary play, the Americans must win their remaining games against New Zealand and Italy to make the medal round.</p>
        <p>Typically emotional, occasionally hyper, Fernandez was beyond the point of restraint after being held back in Coach Ralph Raymond's rotation for this game, this rivalry, described by Fernandez along the lines of ''the Knicks and the Heat.''</p>
        <p>Bouncing on her toes between pitches like an agitated boxer forsaking his stool, Fernandez was overpowering, running through the first nine hitters in the Australian batting order. She struck out six and the only ball hit halfway well was a soft liner back to the mound.</p>
        <p>The Americans weren't doing much against Harding, though. They wasted a two-out double by Michele Smith in the third, and left another runner on third in the fourth. The Australians didn't get their first runner until one out in the home fourth, when Natalie Ward grounded a single through the middle. Hernandez took a deep breath, got the next two outs and the scoreless battle went on.</p>
        <p>When you think about the nature of this pitching-dominated sport, the fact the United States had lost a total of seven international games in 17 years and had not endured a two-game losing streak since 1982 is even more amazing. In so many low-scoring games, what are the odds against any team, even one with the superior talent, not muffing a ground ball at the worst of times?</p>
        <p>Stuff happens, at least that is what the Americans were telling themselves after two insufferably fruitless nights at the plate that led to botched plays at second base in extra innings and losses to Japan and China. While the medal round still wasn't in jeopardy, the cloak of invincibility, real or imagined, was long gone by the time the United States walked onto the field for its showdown with Australia.</p>
        <p>''We did think we were going to do a lot better than what we are,'' Fernandez said. ''We have to have a different frame of mind.''</p>
        <p>A few more hits wouldn't hurt, and perhaps a bit less sitting back and waiting for the long ball, a longtime habit.</p>
        <p>While not alone in her futility in getting on base or getting a runner in from third, Fernandez broke down in tears after the Japan game on Tuesday, at which point she was 0 for 13 in the tournament and still awaiting her turn to pitch. Six more hitless trips to the plate followed in the 2-0, 14-inning loss to China, in which 21 strikeouts and 13 scoreless innings by Smith were wasted.</p>
        <p>The game got away moments after the late-night sprinkler system activated and sent the players scurrying to their benches. With the Americans' collective ego already dampened, they had to face Harding on her home turf in a rematch of the memorable Atlanta Olympics preliminary round game four years ago. Fernandez took a perfect game into the bottom of the 10th inning with a 1-0 lead; the United States had knocked in its ''free'' runner at second base, which is women's softball's version of the shootout at the start of the 10th inning. With two outs and two strikes on Joanne Brown, Fernandez threw a ''riser that didn't rise.'' Brown hit it over the center-field fence.</p>
        <p>Stuff happens, though the Americans recovered from that trauma and resumed course for a gold medal.</p>
