        <p>Voter attitudes toward Rick A. Lazio have turned markedly more negative since June, with suburban women now moving solidly toward Hillary Rodham Clinton and many New Yorkers saying Mr. Lazio came across as harsh and inexperienced in his debate with Mrs. Clinton last week, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.</p>
        <p>The survey, which began last Thursday and was completed on Tuesday night, suggested deterioration in Mr. Lazio's standing at the time that most politicians believe that voters are beginning serious  consideration of the choice before them in the race for Senate.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton now has a 9-point lead over her opponent, with 48 percent to Mr. Lazio's 39 percent. The remaining voters are undecided or are supporting minor-party candidates.</p>
        <p>In the last Times/CBS poll, taken in June, Mrs. Clinton had a 5-point lead over Mr. Lazio, who had just entered the race.</p>
        <p>When the undecided voters were encouraged to express which way they were leaning, and their probable votes were added to the totals, Mrs. Clinton broke the 50 percent barrier in the most recent poll, something of a milestone in this race, leading Mr. Lazio by 51 percent to 41 percent.</p>
        <p>The poll was taken starting the evening after the debate in Buffalo, an encounter that seems to have enhanced Mrs. Clinton's standing, at least for the time being. Nearly half of the poll respondents who saw the debate pronounced Mrs. Clinton the winner, a perception that Mrs. Clinton's advisers acknowledged could fade with time.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio are to meet in at least two more debates, and Mr. Lazio had, as of Aug. 23, the last federal reporting date, $10.2 million in campaign funds to finance television advertisements attacking an opponent who Mr. Lazio's advisers argue is ripe for attack. Mrs. Clinton showed $7.1 million in campaign funds available in her August report.</p>
        <p>And there is, as aides to both candidates noted yesterday, plenty of  time left, in a contest that will not end for six weeks, particularly given the relatively large number of voters who remain undecided.</p>
        <p>If history is any guide, most of those voters are likely in the end to favor Mr. Lazio, the way they would choose a challenger over an incumbent, because Mrs. Clinton is already so well known that voters have solidly formed opinions about her.</p>
        <p>The Times/CBS News poll sketched an electoral landscape that, as of today, seems daunting for the four-term Republican congressman from Suffolk County who, like Mrs. Clinton, is running for statewide office for the first time.</p>
        <p>Potentially of most concern to Mr. Lazio is the growing support for Mrs. Clinton among a group of voters that has been worrying the first lady's advisers: suburban women. Mr. Lazio was leading among those voters by 43 percent to 36 percent in June. Now, she has the support of 54 percent of suburban women, compared to 38 percent for Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mrs. Clinton has the support of 56 percent of women in all areas of the state who describe themselves as moderate. In June, she and Mr. Lazio were tied among those voters.</p>
        <p>Among the reasons for Mrs. Clinton's improved standing with those female voters, the poll findings suggest, was the aggressive posture Mr. Lazio struck toward Mrs. Clinton at the debate in Buffalo. That episode has emerged as a watershed in this campaign, since it was the first time so many viewers had an opportunity to view a candidate whom most people did not know before the summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio attacked her at almost every question, and at the end, he walked over to her lectern, demanding that she sign a piece of paper renouncing the use of soft-money campaign contributions.</p>
        <p>Among women who watched the debate, half of the poll respondents said that Mr. Lazio did not display the requisite maturity and experience to serve in the United States Senate. Half also said that Mrs. Clinton had won the debate, compared to  26 percent who said Mr. Lazio won.</p>
        <p>Men who watched the debate had a more favorable reaction to Mr. Lazio's performance. Still, overall, 54 percent of respondents who viewed it said that Mr. Lazio was too aggressive, compared to just 4 percent who said the same thing about Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''It was the aggressiveness'' Mr. Lazio showed during the debate Marie Harvey, 75, a medical secretary from New Hyde Park who had been undecided, said in a follow-up interview, ''that did it for me. I had never heard him speak for any length of time before that. I thought Lazio should have come out with more of his background in Congress instead of attacking her husband's actions. I was surprised that Hillary Clinton displayed so much poise and control during the debate.''</p>
        <p>According to the poll, Mr. Lazio's difficulties go beyond women voters. Respondents who now hold an unfavorable view of Mr. Lazio have nearly tripled, to 28 percent, since 10 percent in the last poll, while his favorable rating is 33 percent, up from 26 percent in June.</p>
        <p>Four in 10 respondents describe Mr. Lazio as conservative, a 13-point jump since June, suggesting that Mrs. Clinton has achieved some success in linking Mr. Lazio with conservative members of Congress, like former Speaker Newt Gingrich.  There has also been a sharp jump in the number of voters who believe Mr. Lazio is spending more time attacking his opponent than explaining his positions, and more voters believe that he is running a more negative campaign than Mrs. Clinton is. That might complicate any attempt by Mr. Lazio to turn up the volume of his attacks, as he is planning to do over the next six weeks.</p>
        <p>The poll was conducted among  1,212 registered voters, of whom 1,066 were characterized as likely to vote. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
        <p>The Times/CBS poll also found that in the presidential race in New York, the Democrat, Al Gore, is leading George W. Bush, the Republican, by nearly two to one. That, too, is unwelcome news for Mr. Lazio, since it almost certainly means that Mr. Bush will not devote time or money to this state, and that the Democratic turnout could be particularly high for Mr. Gore. In a contest roughly analogous to this one, when Robert F. Kennedy moved from Massachusetts to New York State and run for Senator in 1964, Mr. Kennedy won in no small part because Lyndon B. Johnson was elected president with a 2.4 million vote margin in New York.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton is now doing extremely well in New York City, with about 70 percent of the vote. A strong showing there is essential for any Democrat running for statewide office. By contrast, upstate, the Republican stronghold in New York, Mr. Lazio has the support of about half the voters, which is probably below what a Republican candidate needs to win a statewide race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's advisers disputed the findings of the Times/CBS poll, and said their own polls showed the race to be tighter. They said they were pleased with the candidate's performance to date and confident of his victory. ''I hope Mrs. Clinton believes this poll,'' said Mike Murphy, Mr. Lazio's consultant. ''She's in for a big surprise on Election Day.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's pollster, Mark Penn, said the findings reflected his  polls, and asserted they represented  a rebuke to the way Mr. Lazio has conducted his campaign. ''It shows that the voters rejected the campaign of insults that Rick Lazio launched almost since the moment he entered the race,'' Mr. Penn said. ''I think further it shows that people are finding out more about Lazio and more about his record.''</p>
        <p>The dynamics of the election have clearly shifted since the last Times/ CBS poll, in June, when Mr. Lazio first stepped both into the race to replace Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and into a statistical tie with the first lady. The change over the summer has largely been to Mrs. Clinton's benefit, though her successes would appear, in no small measure, to be a consequence of difficulties Mr. Lazio has encountered.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton remains where she has been for much of the year: hovering with between 45 and 49 percent of the vote, with about one-third of the voters expressing an unfavorable opinion of her.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Lazio is no longer the little-known quantity he once was, and that might not be entirely to his benefit. At 28 percent, his unfavorable rating is nearly as high as Mrs. Clinton's, which is 32 percent. And the poll found that 46 percent of New Yorkers say that Mr. Lazio cares about ''the needs and problems of people like yourself,'' double what that was in June, while 56 percent said they believed Mrs. Clinton cares about their problems.</p>
        <p>Those findings, along with the jump in voters who consider Mr. Lazio conservative -- not exactly a selling point in elections in New York -- indicates that Mrs. Clinton's attacks on Mr. Lazio have taken a toll.</p>
        <p>Mattie Perelman, 56, a Republican from Somers, said in a follow-up interview that she had been prepared to support Mr. Giuliani over Mrs. Clinton, but would now vote for Mrs. Clinton after following his campaign to date. ''I don't feel Rick Lazio is experienced or connected enough to be effective,'' she said. ''I don't think he's a heavyweight at all compared to Hillary Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also does not appear to have had, again so far, much success in his attacks on Mrs. Clinton. The number of voters who view her unfavorably is 32 percent; it was 31 percent in April, when she was running against Mr. Giuliani. Nearly one in two voters view her favorably, the highest number since her name first emerged as a possible candidate for Senate in New York last March.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's principal attack on Mrs. Clinton, that she is untrustworthy, also does not yet appear to have taken hold. One in two respondents said Mrs. Clinton has the honesty and integrity to be senator, about the same as in February. That is also about the same number of people who say that Mr. Lazio has the honesty and integrity to be senator.</p>
        <p>Finally, the poll suggested that the debate in Buffalo was an unusually pivotal moment in the campaign.  Nearly half the respondents said they watched the debate, a high figure.</p>
        <p>In the Times/CBS poll, 47 percent said that Mrs. Clinton had won the debate, compared to 33 percent who said Mr. Lazio had. And one in three said the debate was too negative and held Mr. Lazio accountable for that; again, just 4 percent said that about Mrs. Clinton. (Two percent said the fault lay with Tim Russert, the moderator.)</p>
        <p>How the Senate Poll Was Conducted</p>
        <p>The latest New York Times/CBS News poll of New York State is based on telephone interviews conducted Sept. 14-19 with 1,611 adults throughout the state. Of those, 1,212 said they were registered to vote. Interviews were conducted in either English or Spanish.</p>
        <p>The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges across the state. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.</p>
        <p>The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region of the state, race, Hispanic origin, sex, age and education.</p>
        <p>In addition, the questions about voting preferences in the 2000 election for United States Senate are based on the responses of 1,066 ''likely voters.'' Likely voters are those who say they are registered, intend to vote in November, and voted in 1998 or 1996, further weighted so that those who reside in New York City make up 31 percent of the entire state, which is the city's typical share of total ballots cast on Election Day.</p>
        <p>In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult residents of New York State. For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. As an example, for likely voters in the suburbs surrounding New York City it is plus or minus seven percentage points.</p>
        <p>In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.</p>
