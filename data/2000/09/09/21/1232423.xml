        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>CLASH ON ENERGY POLICY  Winter is coming, and so, it seems, is a battle between the presidential campaigns over energy policy. Vice President Al Gore, a frequent critic of ''big oil,'' told Fox News yesterday that he would give ''a major policy speech'' today on what to do about the soaring price of home heating oil. Gov. George W. Bush, the former oil man, pounced on that issue yesterday, critizing President Clinton and Mr. Gore for lacking an energy policy and pointing out that the surge in oil prices had occurred in their administration. ''I'm just asking what the man's solution is,'' Mr. Bush said of Mr. Gore in an interview on MSNBC.</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>A PLUG WITH A PURPOSE  Beginning a three-day tour of the Midwest, Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president, said yesterday in Wisconsin that he thought Vice President Al Gore was pulling away from Gov. George W. Bush. ''I think he's going to do to Bush what Clinton did to Dole in 1996,'' Mr. Nader told reporters. His words seemed intended to reassure liberal voters that casting a ballot for him would not help elect Mr. Bush, an argument that Democrats have used to try to woo Nader supporters into Mr. Gore's camp. Mr. Nader also said he planned to spend more time campaigning in states where the election is expected to be lopsided, so Democrats would feel comfortable about voting for him. Those states include Texas, New York, Massachusetts and California, he said.</p>

        <p>THE DEBATES</p>
        <p>CASTING FOR THE DEBATES  The casting of the onstage roles in the 2000 debates is now complete. The Commission on Presidential Debates says that the CNN anchor Bernard Shaw will be the moderator of the vice presidential debate at Centre College in Danville, Ky., on Oct. 5. Mr. Shaw, who has been with CNN since its founding in 1980, has served over the years as a questioner or moderator in a number of primary and general election debates, his most memorable appearance being in the second commission debate of 1988, when he asked the Democratic nominee, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, whether he would support the death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered. Mr. Dukakis's placid response to the disconcerting question became an issue itself in the campaign.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>WHERE BRADLEY IS NOW  Former Senator Bill Bradley, who has been out of the political limelight since losing to Al Gore in the Democratic primaries, has taken a position as a board member and adviser to the chief executive of a new company called UPromise Inc. The Boston-based firm is trying to create a financial product that will allow people to amass tax-free savings accounts for college by purchasing goods from certain vendors. ''Obviously this is to make money,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''But they also want to change the world.'' Mr. Bradley also has written a new political book that will be released next week, entitled ''The Journey From Here.'' It offers his reflections on the issues he tried to raise in his presidential run.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>MILLIONAIRE IN SENATE RACE  Maria Cantwell, an Internet millionaire who is using part of her wealth to underwrite a bid for the United States Senate, won the Democratic primary in Washington State on Tuesday and will go up against the veteran Republican incumbent, Slade Gorton, in November. After pouring $5 million into her primary campaign, Ms. Cantwell, who served a single term in the House in the early 1990's, easily bested State Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn. Mr. Gorton, who is seeking a fourth Senate term, faced little competition in Tuesday's Republican primary. But his popularity has slipped in recent years in the state and he is considered one of the more vulnerable Republican senators this year.</p>

        <p>THE TRAVEL LOG  A number of new national polls indicate the presidential race may be tightening again. But George W. Bush and Al Gore were a continent apart yesterday when it came to campaigning, with Mr. Bush working Pennsylvania and Mr. Gore in California. The stats for the day:</p>
