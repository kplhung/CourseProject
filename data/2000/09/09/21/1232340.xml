        <p>Who doesn't dream of a Dan Jansen Olympic moment? For four years, for more hours in the gym and on the cycling track than he could remember, Marty Nothstein thought of little else.</p>
        <p>''There were a lot of tears, a lot of skin lost, to get to this day,'' he said tonight at the Olympic Velodrome, rejoicing following redemption.</p>
        <p>His reversal of fortune, his triumph of the spirit, came on wheels, not skates. It didn't pack the sudden emotional outpouring of Jansen's long-delayed speedskating gold medal performance at the 1994 Lillehammer Games, but don't tell Nothstein that. The victory lap, with his young son aboard the bike, after winning the men's sprint in track cycling felt just as good. The kisses from his wife were just as sweet.</p>
        <p>The medal around his neck -- the first Olympic gold in cycling for the United States since 1984 and first nonboycott gold for a male cyclist since 1904 -- was equally earned.</p>
        <p>Nothstein had to beat his longtime rival and the two-time defending Olympic gold medalist, Jens Fiedler of Germany, in the semifinals, and did. He had to descend from the cloud within the hour and snatch the gold from a world-class French sprinter, Florian Rousseau, and did. Nothstein, a 29-year-old two-time world champion from Trexlertown, Pa., won both the two-of-three-race rounds in two straight, powering from the outside in the stretch of all four.</p>
        <p>That was his plan, and he stuck with it, holding his once-notorious temper in check after some bumping with Fiedler and controlling his emotions after learning that a longtime friend and fellow cyclist, Nicole Reinhart, had died in a road race accident in Massachusetts earlier this week.</p>
        <p>''Since we found out about the tragedy, everyone here has been thinking about her,'' Nothstein said. ''I know I have. But I came here to win.''</p>
        <p>Nothstein had defeated the 30-year-old Fiedler before, though not since 1997. At the medal news conference, when the American said he believed he was the better cyclist in 1996, Fiedler frowned and later said: ''I was better in '96. He was better today.''</p>
        <p>These two have been stalking each other on banked tracks worldwide for the better part of a decade, in a sport that might best be prepared for by driving a New York City cab.</p>
        <p>Head-to-head, the sprint consists of three laps, with the first two used for feeling the other out, building up speed before the final all-out sprint, which is the one that is timed. It is not a sport for the faint of heart, or those weak from the waist down.</p>
        <p>At 6 feet 3 inches tall, 210 pounds, with short-cropped hair, Nothstein has the legs of a linebacker. He played football in high school, and was a baseball catcher, but team sports were a diversion, for fun. As a 12-year-old, he and his brother were caught throwing rocks at the house of a neighbor, Heinz Walter, who suggested that he do something useful like take advantage of a free local cycling program.</p>
        <p>As he had always been something of a daredevil on wheels, Nothstein went for the bait, was soon hooked and later targeted the Atlanta Olympics as his place to strike gold. He said that defeat to Fiedler, after losing the first sprint by the tread of a tire, has ''haunted me every day.''</p>
        <p>The last couple of years, he practically moved into the Lehigh Valley Velodrome and the West End Racquet Club. He worked out until he was dizzy and had to lie down. He lifted 270 pounds of weights until he had to rush to a bucket he kept nearby to throw up.</p>
        <p>''People don't see the grind you go through,'' he said. ''The only thing they see is you standing on the podium getting a gold medal around his neck.''</p>
        <p>He narrowly beat Fiedler in both sprints with almost identical times of 10.930 and 10.903. In the other semifinal, the Frenchman, Rousseau, needed a third ride to eliminate his countryman, Laurent Gane, while Nothstein rested.</p>
        <p>''A good surprise,'' said Nothstein's coach, Gil Hatton.</p>
        <p>The final was a mismatch. The Frenchman, outweighed by 40 pounds, didn't have the energy or the power to prevent Nothstein from twice blowing by him on the outside to win going away.</p>
        <p>''I was aware that my opponent was very strong and capable of overtaking me on the outside,'' Rousseau said.</p>
        <p>Soon after, the medal was around Nothstein's neck, and he was back on the bike, riding a lap with the American flag flapping in the draft. Then his wife, Christi, was in the first row of seats, helping 5-year-old Tyler over the restraining wall, while their daughter, 2-year-old Devin, stayed in her arms.</p>
        <p>''I made sacrifices and so did my family,'' Nothstein said.</p>
        <p>It paid off in gold.</p>
        <p>Frenchwoman Wins Gold</p>
        <p>SYDNEY, Australia, Sept. 20 -- In the women's gold medal match, the five-time world champion Felicia Ballanger of France beat Oxana Grichina of Russia, 2-1. Irina Yanovych of Ukraine beat Michelle Ferris of Australia, 2-0, for the bronze.</p>
        <p>Juan Llaneras or Spain won the men's 40-kilometer points race. Milton Wynants of Uruguay took the silver and Aleksei Markov of Russia won the bronze.</p>
