        <p>The Suffolk County police are investigating the death of a 62-year-old gunsmith who was also a retired New York City police officer in a fire that ravaged his home here on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>The body of the former officer, Ronald Tortorella, was discovered in the kitchen of his home, at 31 Grand Central Avenue, where the police said they also found several thousand rounds of ammunition. The fire remains under investigation and the cause has not been determined, Detective Lt. John Gierasch of the Suffolk County police said, adding that arson was not suspected.</p>
        <p>The police said that they believed Mr. Tortorella's death had been caused by smoke and heat from the two-alarm blaze, although the official cause would not be determined until a formal autopsy ws completed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tortorella, who lived with his daughter and granddaughter, was home alone during the fire, the police said. Mr. Tortorella is also survived by a son.</p>
        <p>Officers responded to a telephone call from a neighbor who reported hearing an explosion at the house house Tuesday around 7:40 p.m., the police said. Lieutenant Gierasch said that early speculation that ammunition or fireworks ignited the fire was unfounded, and that the explosion neighbors heard was a result, not a cause, of the fire.</p>
        <p>He said ammunition that was found throughout the house was removed by emergency workers and would be destroyed.</p>
        <p>Fire departments from Amityville and Copiague responded to the call, and the 40 firefighters brought the blaze several under control within several hours, fire officials said.  Neighbors said that the one-story house was engulfed minutes after the explosion and that sparks shot into the air over other houses. ''The smoke was terrible, I guess, from the car,'' said Julius Kaczmarski, 77, who was visiting three doors down. ''The rubber tires were burning.''</p>
        <p>Family members and friends gathered yesterday on lawn chairs in front of the house, whose gutted carport housed a burnt-out car.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know until two hours later that Ron was in the house when it happened,'' said Eileen Cole, who said she lives around the corner and has known Mr. Tortorella for more than 20 years. ''It's just a tragedy. Thank God, like I said, no one else was in the house at the time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tortorella cleaned and restored guns as a hobby, said Ms. Cole, but had spoken about giving it up. She recalled that his granddaughter and daughter had moved in with him several months ago, and that he was thrilled to have his grandchild around. She recalled his saying, ''It makes us feel younger.''</p>
