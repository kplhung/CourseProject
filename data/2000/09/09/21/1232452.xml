        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article on finding the right screen name reminded me that sometimes the choice pays off in unexpected ways. I picked ''wyvern'' for several reasons: I liked how it looked and what it meant (a two-legged dragon with wings and a barbed tail), it was so obscure that nobody else was likely to have it, and it was my favorite Scrabble word when I was growing up.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article on finding the right screen name reminded me that sometimes the choice pays off in unexpected ways. I picked ''wyvern'' for several reasons: I liked how it looked and what it meant (a two-legged dragon with wings and a barbed tail), it was so obscure that nobody else was likely to have it, and it was my favorite Scrabble word when I was growing up.</p>
        <p>Last year I was in West Hartford being interviewed for a job producing a video about a prep school. One of the assembled staff members asked: ''Is your screen name really 'wyvern'?'' When I confirmed that and asked why, he replied, ''It's our school mascot.'' Sure enough, through the window I could see two stone dragons perched atop the pillars at the front gate.</p>
        <p>I got the job.</p>
