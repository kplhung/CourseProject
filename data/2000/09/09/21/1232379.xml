        <p>In a brief and businesslike statement, the independent counsel Robert Ray said yesterday that the six-year investigation into Whitewater had produced ''insufficient'' evidence to justify criminal charges against President and Hillary Rodham Clinton. But while the statement came as a great relief to the White House, Mr. Ray's terse legal judgment does not excuse the White House's long record of obfuscation in the Whitewater matter, including its clumsy meddling with official inquiries and its failure to produce relevant records in a timely manner.</p>
        <p>After tidying up some loose ends, Mr. Ray will turn his full report over to the three-judge panel that oversees his office. It should then be released so that the public can draw its own conclusions. In the meantime, Mr. Ray is to be commended for resisting any temptation to convey his private thoughts about these tangled events or otherwise politicize his conclusions in the final weeks of Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign in New York.</p>

        <p>In a brief and businesslike statement, the independent counsel Robert Ray said yesterday that the six-year investigation into Whitewater had produced ''insufficient'' evidence to justify criminal charges against President and Hillary Rodham Clinton. But while the statement came as a great relief to the White House, Mr. Ray's terse legal judgment does not excuse the White House's long record of obfuscation in the Whitewater matter, including its clumsy meddling with official inquiries and its failure to produce relevant records in a timely manner.</p>
        <p>After tidying up some loose ends, Mr. Ray will turn his full report over to the three-judge panel that oversees his office. It should then be released so that the public can draw its own conclusions. In the meantime, Mr. Ray is to be commended for resisting any temptation to convey his private thoughts about these tangled events or otherwise politicize his conclusions in the final weeks of Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign in New York.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, in a report on the so-called Travelgate case, involving the firing of seven White House employees, Mr. Ray likewise found no ground for prosecution. But he had been openly critical of Mrs. Clinton's sworn statements that she had nothing to do with the dismissals. Mrs. Clinton can probably be thankful that Mr. Ray avoided similar commentary in this case. The flat tone of yesterday's statement is a plus for her, and is unlikely to affect her growing lead over Rick Lazio, her Republican challenger, as reflected in the latest New York Times/CBS poll.</p>
        <p>The Clintons themselves are largely responsible for the late delivery of Mr. Ray's statement. From the day that questions were first raised about their relationship to Madison Guaranty, an Arkansas savings and loan that went bust at a cost of more than $70 million to the American taxpayers, they and their political confederates in the White House and the executive branch went to puzzling lengths to hobble legitimate investigations. Instead of candidly laying out the facts of the matter, the Clinton apparatus instead stonewalled the investigators and defamed the Clintons' critics. All this gave rise to suspicions that the Clintons had something to hide, and prolonged the investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray said his office had investigated at least seven separate criminal allegations involving the Clintons, including the mysterious matter of the Rose Law Firm billing records, which detailed Mrs. Clinton's legal work on behalf of the failing savings and loan. In each case, he found that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the Clintons were involved in any crime related to Madison Guaranty or other aspects of Whitewater, or that they had  committed perjury or otherwise obstructed justice.</p>
        <p>Even in advance of the full report, there are obvious lessons to be learned. One is that full disclosure from the outset would have been much the wiser course for the Clintons. Another is that the public is poorly served when senior executive branch officials try to control legitimate inquiries into matters involving the president. In that regard, Congress's decision to allow the independent counsel act to lapse has left the job of investigating executive misbehavior to the Justice Department -- an agency, as recent experience shows, that is ill suited to pursue misdeeds elsewhere in the executive branch. Congress will need to devise some sort of independent mechanism to deal with investigations of potential criminal conduct by the nation's senior federal officials.</p>
