        <p>Eight Cuban survivors of a plane crash in the Gulf of Mexico were taken today to Key West for medical evaluation, a move that is likely to allow them to remain in the United States.</p>
        <p>United States Coast Guard officials decided late this evening to take the eight Cubans to hospitals in Key West so they could be treated for their injuries and evaluated by doctors, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service said.</p>
        <p>Once the eight Cubans set foot on United States soil, they can legally apply for political asylum. A ninth survivor is already being treated in Key West for head and neck injuries and is expected to be moved, perhaps as early as tonight, to be with friends and relatives in Miami.</p>
        <p>The decision to allow the Cubans off a Coast Guard vessel and onto American soil was made according what Greg Gagne, a spokesman for the immigration agency, called medical necessity.</p>
        <p>Ten people in all were inside the small crop-duster plane when it took off from western Cuba on Tuesday and then crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. The crew of the cargo ship Chios Dream pulled all 10 from the water, including one man with serious head injuries who was flown to a hospital in Key West for treatment at a hospital and one man who was killed in the crash.</p>
        <p>Earlier reports from the American authorities had led many here in Miami's Cuban-American community to believe that the eight remaining passengers, none of them with life-threatening injuries, would not be transferred to American soil anytime soon -- or at best, that they would be taken to the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where their requests for political asylum would be heard. But Coast Guard officials apparently decided that all the crash survivors needed medical attention.</p>
        <p>The decision at least appears to head off another confrontation between the Clinton administration and Miami's Cuban Americans, who had clashed over Elian Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>''The Coast Guard has decided to go ahead and medically evacuate the remaining eight Cuban migrants from the Chios Dream,'' Petty Officer Scott Carr was quoted by The Associated Press as saying, referring to the cargo ship. ''We made the recommendation that all the people would be brought in to the hospital so they could be checked out medically.''</p>
        <p>The survivors were transferred from the cargo ship to the cutter Nantucket. They were to be treated at Florida Lower Keys Hospital, Petty Officer Carr said.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both Republicans from South Florida, and the politically powerful Cuban American National Foundation sent letters to the Clinton administration asking that the nine survivors be granted political asylum.</p>
        <p>''Certainly they will face persecution in Cuba for their involvement in such a high-profile and risky attempt to flee the island,'' wrote Mr. Diaz-Balart and Ms. Lehtinen, referring to early news reports that the plane had been hijacked from an airfield in Cuba.</p>
