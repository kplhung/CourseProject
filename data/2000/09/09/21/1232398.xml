        <p>For about eight months, Abdel Ghani Meskini has sat in a Manhattan jail, accused of having a role in a terrorist plot to smuggle explosives into the United States before the millennium celebrations.</p>
        <p>While his lawyer disputes that he had any role in a terrorist plot, Mr. Meskini did make known yesterday one surprising fact about his resume: he was once a confidential informer for the United States government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meskini, a native of Algeria, testified in Federal District Court in Manhattan yesterday that he had cooperated with the United States Customs Service because he felt he had no choice: he was living in the United States illegally and was told he would otherwise be deported.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meskini said he had assisted the Customs Service for about two months in 1995, and at one point made a secret tape recording of others at the behest of a customs agent. The investigation involved allegations that hashish was being smuggled into the United States on Algerian tankers, federal officials said.</p>
        <p>A Customs Service spokesman, Dennis Murphy, said yesterday: ''We can confirm that Abdel Ghani Meskini received a total of $100 compensation from the U.S. Customs Service in 1995 and 1996 for information he provided regarding illegal drug activities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy would not comment on Mr. Meskini's assertion that the customs agent had essentially struck a deal with him not to pursue deportation in return for his assistance.  One government official said the information and assistance from Mr. Meskini, who lived in Boston at the time, led nowhere: no arrests or seizures of drugs were made.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meskini's confidential role with the Customs Service was revealed during cross-examination of Mr. Meskini by a federal prosecutor, David N. Kelley. The testimony was given in a hearing originally sought by Mr. Meskini and his lawyer to block prosecutors from using a lengthy statement Mr. Meskini gave to the Federal Bureau of Investigation after his arrest last Dec. 30 at his Brooklyn apartment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meskini, 32, has been indicted on charges he assisted in a suspected terrorist plot that was interrupted last Dec. 14 when another Algerian, Ahmed Ressam, was arrested as he tried to enter Washington State from Canada. The authorities say Mr. Ressam was trying to smuggle explosives and other bomb-making equipment into the United States.</p>
        <p>A slip of paper found on Mr. Ressam during his arrest contained Mr. Meskini's name and phone number, the authorities have said, leading them to begin surveillance of him and ultimately to arrest him. The intended target of the suspected plot has not been revealed, nor its origins.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meskini and his lawyer, Roland Thau, have said in court papers that Mr. Meskini was not properly informed of his rights against self-incrimination and to counsel during the interrogation. They contend Mr. Meskini spoke to the agents, in a session that lasted about 11 hours, only after they used threats and other forms of psychological pressure on him.</p>
        <p>In court yesterday, Mr. Meskini said it was widely known that in Algeria, police beatings of suspects was common. Judge John F. Keenan interrupted and asked Mr. Meskini whether any of the agents who interrogated him in New York had threatened to beat him.</p>
        <p>''No,'' Mr. Meskini said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Meskini's testimony offered little evidence of coercion. One agent told him that he should cooperate or he could face a lengthy prison term. But the agents did not raise their voices at him, he said, and asked whether he needed to use the bathroom or wanted to take a break to pray.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors say Mr. Meskini was advised of his rights several times, and made a fully voluntary statement. In his testimony yesterday, Mr. Meskini acknowledged that he had read, understood and signed the form waiving his right to counsel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meskini said he had told the agents that he was involved in credit card fraud, but had denied any role as a terrorist. ''I said, 'I have nothing to do with terrorism. The only thing I do is I'm a thief. I do credit card scams. That's all,' '' he testified.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meskini acknowledged that while being interrogated, he made telephone calls at the request of the F.B.I. (which the agency recorded with his consent), to Mokhtar Haouari, who has since been arrested and also charged in the suspected plot.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor, Mr. Kelley, appeared to want to elicit Mr. Meskini's testimony about his cooperation with customs agents to show that he was already familiar with law enforcement and its techniques, and that his taped calls for the F.B.I. last December were not much different from the secret tape recording he made for the customs agent in 1995.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thau said after the hearing that the government's decision to elicit Mr. Meskini's testimony about his work for the Customs Service was not relevant to the case against his client, nor was it damaging. Mr. Thau said it showed that ''law enforcement people sometimes close their eyes to their sworn duty to, in this case, get an illegal alien deported.''</p>
        <p>The prosecutor, Mr. Kelley, had no comment. The customs agent, who was identified as Robert O'Connell, has since died, Customs Service officials said. Judge Keenan said he would issue a ruling by Oct. 27 on whether to suppress Mr. Meskini's statement.</p>
