        <p>FOR an industry that is supposed to be improving the lives of people around the world, or at least around the United States, the telecommunications business sure looks ugly these days. Shares in communications carriers -- large and small -- are in a mire. Growth rates are slowing. The downturn is so broad that it might even comfort AT&amp;T, which is stuck in one of its own periodic funks.</p>
        <p>This week's victim appears to be the Sprint Corporation. Yesterday, Sprint said that its core operation would fail to meet analysts' earnings expectations for the third quarter. The company added that the core unit would grow at its slowest rate since the company issued a tracking stock for its wireless division almost two years ago. As for the wireless unit, the company said it would grow by about 800,000 subscribers this quarter, about 100,000 fewer than many analysts had expected.</p>
        <p>Even though Sprint said the wireless unit would generate more cash flow in the quarter than had been previously expected, investors dumped the wireless shares, sending them down $7.81, to $33, on the New York Stock Exchange. Sprint shares fell $1.50, to $26.81, also on the Big Board. As could be expected, the Sprint news spread like a contagion, sending down the shares of just about every big United States communications carrier.</p>
        <p>This is the way it has been recently in the communications services business. Investors are afraid that too many companies and too much newly raised capital are chasing too few customers and too few revenue opportunities. That can be seen as a general problem. Throw in the specific fact that the long-distance telephone business is imploding amid ferocious price competition and much of the industry now has an investor base that is just looking for reasons to sell.</p>
        <p>Consider Sprint's wireless unit. The company said that it would sign up about 11 percent fewer customers this quarter than analysts had expected but that it still hoped to meet its overall subscriber target for this year. The shares dropped 19 percent yesterday despite the fact that the company said its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization would be ''in the low $100 million range.'' An analyst for Salomon Smith Barney said yesterday that he had expected that figure to come in at $71 million. A Merrill Lynch analyst had that estimate at $55.8 million.</p>
        <p>Sprint, which has about eight million wireless subscribers, said it would miss the earlier target partly because of increased competition but also because it was cutting off more of its own users for not paying their bills.</p>
        <p>Of course, if William T. Esrey, Sprint's chairman, had had his way, he would not be running the company today. Sprint was supposed to be owned by WorldCom by now. It is not, and it turns out that not only did the failure of that merger bruise some egos, it has also bruised Sprint's financial performance.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Sprint said that its core group (just about everything except wireless) would grow about 4 percent in the third quarter compared with results from the quarter a year earlier. Not only does that mean that Sprint may grow more slowly than AT&amp;T this quarter, it also means that Sprint's growth has slowed every quarter this year. In the fourth quarter of 1999, Sprint's core unit grew about 8.1 percent compared with figures in the period a year earlier. The growth figure was 7.1 percent in the first quarter of this year and 5.5 percent in the second.</p>
        <p>The price wars in the long-distance business have certainly played a role in that slowdown. But so did the collapse of the WorldCom deal.</p>
        <p>''There was a belief that in getting the merger completed we would have to divest some of the Internet business,'' Arthur B. Krause, Sprint's chief financial officer, said in an interview yesterday. ''So the focus on those sorts of products was not the same as if we were trying to grow those markets independently. If the deal had gone through, you wind up saying, 'O.K., we're looking at a combined unit going forward.' So when the deal failed, we lost some momentum that we can regain with some effort.''</p>
        <p>That is a remarkably candid thing for a chief financial officer to say: part of the reason Sprint is growing so slowly is that the company is now stuck with a data communications unit that was damaged through neglect when Sprint thought it would have to sell that division to someone else.</p>
        <p>Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted that Sprint's core operation would earn 49 cents a share this quarter. Yesterday, the company said it would earn 45 to 47 cents. Mr. Krause said that a big part of the difference could be attributed to Sprint's continued ownership of 25 percent of a money-losing Brazilian communications venture. People close to Sprint said the company had expected to have sold that stake by now and was still trying to find a buyer.</p>
