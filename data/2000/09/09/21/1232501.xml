        <p>The Rangers got down to 33 players yesterday by reassigning defenseman Filip Novak to his junior team, the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League.</p>
        <p>''We're very pleased with the way he played for us, but he wasn't going to make the team this year,'' Coach Ron Low said.</p>
        <p>Low said he planned to skate Pavel Brendl on a line with Petr Nedved in a preseason game tonight in Atlanta to try and gauge what the highly touted prospect can do.</p>

        <p>McCLEARY RETIRES: Trent McCleary, the Montreal Canadiens wing who was nearly killed when struck on the throat by a puck last season, retired yesterday, citing the injury as the reason.</p>
        <p>McCleary said the team doctor, David Mulder, refused to clear him to play because he had breathing problems in the Canadiens' opening exhibition game on Sunday. ''He said, 'this is dangerous,' McCleary said.</p>
        <p>McCleary said although the injury had healed enough for him to live a normal life, he had problems breathing while playing.</p>
        <p>McCleary's larynx was fractured when he was hit on the throat while blocking a slap shot from Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Chris Therien during a game Jan. 29 at the Molson Center. (AP)</p>
