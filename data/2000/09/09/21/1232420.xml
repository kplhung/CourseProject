        <p>Last week, when NBC signed a deal to hold a televised  contest to send a civilian into space aboard a Russian-built rocket, the television networks seemed to have pushed their hunger for new forms of reality programming literally to new heights.</p>
        <p>But there may be more to come. The networks are continuing to make deals for programs that involve everything from a scavenger hunt around the world to a competition to escape from a high-technology prison.</p>
        <p>Perhaps nothing captures the competitive atmosphere in television as much as a series of program-pitch meetings this week in which executives at three networks  pondered an offer to start a new form of space race going against the NBC show with one of their own -- with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as a partner.</p>
        <p>At least that is what the networks were told would be possible.</p>
        <p>A company with ties to NASA, Dreamtime Holdings Inc., proposed -- at meetings Monday with CBS, ABC, and Fox -- a show that would use NASA facilities at the Johnson Space Center in Houston to train 20 contestants hoping to be selected to spend a week aboard the new International Space Station, executives at the three networks said.</p>
        <p>Dreamtime, a multimedia company based in Moffett Field, Calif., that has contracted with NASA for a number of media projects, was offering the show to the networks in conjunction with the prominent Hollywood talent agency,  Endeavor. A third party, an independent producer of documentaries called Highway Films, was also involved in the talks, the executives said.</p>
        <p>NASA was not represented at the pitch meetings with the networks.  Asked yesterday if NASA approval would be given for such a move, a  spokesman for the agency, Robert Jacobs, said only: ''NASA has not seen a proposal for such a show. The agency has to see a proposal before it makes any commitment.''</p>
        <p>Dreamtime's chief executive, Bill Foster, who attended the pitch meetings, would not discuss the nature of the talks. In a telephone interview Tuesday, he said his company would act only within the boundaries of its contract with NASA. In a statement yesterday, Mr. Foster said Dreamtime was ''pursuing opportunities to generate greater excitement, awareness and understanding about space.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jacobs said that any deal involving the use of facilities at the Johnson center or the living quarters aboard the space station would require Congressional approval.</p>
        <p>The show being pitched to the networks was similar to the one that NBC committed to two weeks ago, except that it would be American-based as opposed to Moscow-based, and produced in cooperation with an American governmental agency, not with MirCorp, an independent company set up to exploit commercial possibilities of the aging Russian space station, Mir.</p>
        <p>Executives at all of the networks involved said they had been told that NASA would be participating in the program. Sandy Grushow, the chairman of Fox Entertainment, said: ''We were told NASA was involved. If they're producing this thing through NASA, that's the powerful attraction.''</p>
        <p>A senior ABC program executive, who requested anonymity, said, ''They told us this had a stamp of endorsement from NASA.''</p>
        <p>Endorsed or not, a deal for the show has not yet developed at any network. One network senior executive said, ''I'm skeptical that either of these space shows will get off the ground.'' He cited questions about liability exposure for the network.</p>
        <p>But Mark Burnett, the producer behind the Mir show at NBC, and the man who turned ''Survivor'' into the television hit of the year for CBS, remains confident that he will make his show for NBC. ''I'm laughing at the idea of NASA reacting to me,'' Mr. Burnett said of the prospect of a competing show. ''Talk is cheap. I can actually do this.''</p>
        <p>Even if some skepticism surrounds the space idea, skepticism about reality shows is not widespread inside the network entertainment divisions. They continue to buy reality formats, in search of the next show that might capture the imagination of American viewers the way ''Survivor'' did on CBS.</p>
        <p>''The networks not only remain enthusiastic about the reality genre, but the next iterations are all about one-upping the others,'' said Ben Silverman, the head of international packaging for the William Morris Agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverman noted that the shows have mainly been imported from Europe, ''and there shows like ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and ''Survivor'' are several years old. The Europeans are already onto the next wave.''</p>
        <p>One of those shows, which ABC is enthusiastic about, is ''Jailbreak,'' in which a group of contestants try to be the first one to break out of a high-technology prison.</p>
        <p>Fox's ''Boot Camp'' will follow a group of volunteer recruits through the rigors of military training in pursuit of cash prizes.</p>
        <p>Longer range, Fox's syndication division is interested in a show called ''The Big Diet,'' which follows a group of people trying to lose the most weight for a cash prize.</p>
        <p>And ABC has a show called ''Life on Mars,'' which will put a group of people into a house approximating living conditions on Mars.</p>
