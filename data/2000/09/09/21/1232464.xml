        <p>Greetings from the Sydney Games, where the Knicks' new starting center was outplayed by Canada's Todd MacCulloch the other night.</p>
        <p>Patrick Ewing probably always imagined himself traded for another Hall of Famer. Today, Luc Longley, the underachieving center of the Australian national team, will have to do.

        <p>Greetings from the Sydney Games, where the Knicks' new starting center was outplayed by Canada's Todd MacCulloch the other night.</p>
        <p>Patrick Ewing probably always imagined himself traded for another Hall of Famer. Today, Luc Longley, the underachieving center of the Australian national team, will have to do. He is a very pleasant bloke, always quick with a joke and very complimentary of the centers who routinely outplay him. But whether playing him or Travis Knight, also part of last night's trade, makes the Knicks more of a contender is barely a question worth answering.</p>
        <p>This is hard to figure. Perhaps the decision-makers high above Penn Plaza saw Longley in the opening ceremony and were overcome with Olympic spirit. Maybe they were scared into moving Ewing, dreading the prolonging of a relationship that was beginning to get ugly.</p>
        <p>Maybe one of their owners is infatuated with wheeling and dealing and names, figuring Glen Rice, the marquee name coming to New York, could justify ticket increases and conceal the facade one more season.</p>
        <p>Either way, the Knicks were soon to end their tumultuous 15-year relationship with their franchise center, sending Ewing to Seattle in the kind of monstrous deal that is becoming commonplace for the National Basketball Association. It sounds like another fantasy league swap, concocted by a couple of socially challenged freshmen over a pepperoni and mushroom pizza in the campus bar.</p>
        <p>The Knicks get six players, including Rice, Longley, Knight, Vernon Maxwell and four draft picks, including the Lakers' and the Sonics' top pick in 2001. Ewing goes to Seattle. Horace Grant and three others go to the Lakers. Chris Dudley and a Knicks top pick in 2001 go to Phoenix.</p>
        <p>Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant finally get the kind of front-line support to stave off Portland's redwoods for another season. The Suns get a former All-Star, who is trying to find his game and his balance. And the SuperSonics acquire a professional in the pivot, who at 38 is still one of the top 10 centers in the game, a warrior who, despite his injury-prone status the past three seasons, is entering a contract year -- always a motivating factor for aging players in this league.</p>
        <p>The Knicks? Unless they have something else percolating, they give up one of the few players who could grab an important defensive rebound for them last season, earn a trip to the foul line in the final minutes and occasionally blend in seamlessly with Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell. Unless they have something else percolating, they give up any shot of contending for a championship.</p>
        <p>First round and out.</p>
        <p>You will hear testimony from people today who believe the Knicks can survive and thrive without Ewing, who believe a player like Rice will turn them into the Sacramento Kings of the Eastern Conference, a breathless, seat-of-the-pants team that will make beautiful music in the open court. They will be entertaining to watch for, oh, about 85 games.</p>
        <p>It is true that Ewing had a hard time grasping the fact he was no longer an All-Star. At times, he monopolized the ball at the end of games as if it were 1992 all over again and he could put up 40, on Cartwright or whatever overmatched soul was guarding him. But he also shot less and passed more after injuries robbed his body of its explosiveness.</p>
        <p>Was Patrick the answer? Should he be thoroughly celebrated today instead of ushered out of town? Probably not. But for a city allegedly home to some of the most knowledgeable basketball people in the world, the good-riddance mob borders on the pathetic. Many became infected with knee-jerk opinions about his game and his contributions to the team the past two seasons, jumping on the same Patrick-Must-Go bandwagon each time he had a tough night.</p>
        <p>The whole town so loved the things Spree and Marcus could do above the rim, they became more infatuated with eye candy than winning basketball. At times, when Ewing kicked the ball out, rebounded and hit his baseline fallaway when no one else was open, the Garden had both.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it's appropriate that the Knicks wind up with Longley, who will be subjected to some of the most unfair treatment in his career. He will hear every uncouth knock on his game, take in stride the weekly back-page abuse and wonder why people are so obsessed with winning in New York, instead of competing and having a good time, as they do Down Under.</p>
        <p>As one of his meek jump shots caroms off the back of the rim to lose a tight game, Longley will wonder what all of New York should be wondering today after they exchanged one future Hall of Famer for a 7-foot role player:</p>
        <p>They used to boo Patrick Ewing? Poor bloke.</p>
