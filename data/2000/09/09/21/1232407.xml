        <p>NBC's ratings for the Sydney Summer Games, which in their first four days drew the Olympics' smallest nighttime audience in American television history, improved on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>But the Games' ratings still fell short of the NBC's original expectations.</p>
        <p>The network's coverage of gymnastics and swimming on Tuesday night drew a 17.8 prime-time rating -- meaning it was watched in an average of 18.2 million households from 8 to 11 p.m.</p>
        <p>NBC said it was its most-watched Tuesday night since July 30, 1996, when it was covering the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. It easily doubled the ratings of each of its broadcast network competitors during prime time.</p>
        <p>But the network's entire night of Olympics coverage, from 7 p.m. to 11:40 p.m., drew a smaller 15.5 rating. (Each rating point represents slightly more than a million households.)</p>
        <p>Though Tuesday's was the best nightly rating so far for the 2000 Summer Games -- they had averaged a 14.3 rating through Monday night -- it was still well below the average rating for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Also shown on NBC, those Games averaged a 17.5 rating.</p>
        <p>NBC had announced publicly that it expected do at least as well this year. The ratings have been so far below original estimates that NBC faces the likelihood of having to reimburse sponsors with free advertising.</p>
        <p>But executives said yesterday that the size of the audience on Tuesday night -- the fifth night of the Games -- gave them hope that the ratings would turn around.</p>
        <p>''We're building momentum,'' said Cameron Blanchard, an NBC Sports spokeswoman. ''There's clearly a big appetite for the Olympics out there.''</p>
        <p>Executives offered no clear reason for the improvement in ratings Tuesday night. They said they generally believed that they were helped by the popularity of gymnastics, which Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports, called ''traditionally the highest-rated events during the Olympics.''</p>
        <p>Executives said they hoped that more gymnastics events, and the emergence of more compelling stories about athletes, would continue to help raise the ratings.</p>
        <p>NBC has attributed many of their Olympics ratings problems to the time difference between Australia and the United States. It is forcing NBC to show events hours after the fact, when results have been widely available not only on TV and radio newscasts, but also on the Internet. The Games are also taking place later in the year than usual, with school back in session and fewer people likely to stay up late watching TV, they said.</p>
