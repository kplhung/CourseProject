        <p>HOW do you compete in a business where the next-largest company holds a market share hovering just under 100 percent? That's the quandary WordPerfect faces.</p>
        <p>A federal judge ruled last spring that Microsoft held a competition-stifling monopoly in personal computer operating systems with a market share of roughly 85 percent. But Microsoft's worldwide dominance in word processors is even more complete, hovering between 93 and 95 percent, by most estimates. So when Dave Ludwick, a senior manager at the Corel Corporation, the Canadian company that owns WordPerfect, said, ''We are pursuing a strong niche strategy,'' he may seem overly optimistic at first glance.</p>
        <p>Five years ago WordPerfect was the world's leading word processor, with more than 50 percent of the market. The program lost its place largely as a result of blunders by the program's former owner, Novell, and astute marketing by Microsoft, which figured out before anyone else that programs packaged in office suites were popular.</p>
        <p>Today many people are surprised to learn that WordPerfect still exists, so complete is Microsoft Word's dominance. But WordPerfect, the oldest word processing program still in wide production for PC's, is thrumming along.</p>
        <p>Version 1.0, called P-Edit, came out in 1979. It was renamed WordPerfect in 1980. Version 9.0 is now in use, and it is utterly competitive with Word.</p>
        <p>WordPerfect partisans, and there are still millions of them, primarily in government and the legal profession, argue that it's better.</p>
        <p>But Corel understands one thing perfectly: to survive, WordPerfect must be fully compatible with Word. If a WordPerfect user cannot open a Word attachment that arrives by e-mail, the program will not survive.</p>
        <p>''WordPerfect can't place its users on a technological island,'' Mr. Ludwick acknowledged. Or, as Don Sylvester, a former Corel official, put it in an interview while he was still with the company in 1998: ''It's clear to us that Microsoft isn't the competition anymore. They are our environment.''</p>
        <p>Historically, word processors have engendered stronger customer loyalty than many other sorts of programs, largely because learning to use one takes a lot of time. That's less true today, with the great similarities among Windows programs. But that phenomenon has left WordPerfect with a large base of 22 million users in the United States and Canada, according to one marketing survey. I am one of them.</p>
        <p>I've used WordPerfect off and on since Version 2.24 in 1983, when the program was produced by the Satellite Software International of Provo, Utah. My first serial number was 5,250. In recent years I've also used Word. In many ways now, the programs are largely interchangeable.</p>
        <p>I wrote this article to this point in WordPerfect. But now, after saving it in WordPerfect format, I've opened the file in Word without a hiccup. After writing another sentence, I saved the file in Word format and moved back to WordPerfect. I picked up where I left off without a fault.</p>
        <p>Over time I've encountered Word users who cannot open my WordPerfect file attachments, for reasons that are not easily explained. And I occasionally receive a Windows file of one form or another that Word will open but WordPerfect will not. Here again, the reasons remain obscure. So even the dedicated WordPerfect user can find that it's best to have a copy of Word, too, to be completely safe when exchanging files via e-mail.</p>
        <p>While WordPerfect looks and feels a lot like Word, WordPerfect's interface is cleaner than Word's. Icons don't pop up unbidden. Almost any significant feature you might find on Word you'll also find on WordPerfect, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>But Corel officials point to a couple of conveniences, including one that has stayed with the program since the earliest versions: the Reveal Codes option.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, in a complex document, you will become muddled in conflicting commands. A font change or an indent command will find its way into your document even though you swear you didn't put it there.</p>
        <p>Hit the Reveal Codes button, and a gray shaded panel pops up at the bottom of the screen displaying several lines of text around the cursor. In that box, every hidden embedded command is shown. You can edit or delete them, then exit to find your document repaired. That one feature is a tremendous convenience and has no direct counterpart in Word (the comparable feature in Word is more limited).</p>
        <p>The drop-down menus for typeface and font size -- in the upper-left margin of the lower tool bar, just as in Word -- display true-to-life examples of the various typefaces or font sizes your cursor passes as you scroll through the options. Another nice feature.</p>
        <p>And the program is infinitely customizable. Every toolbar can be changed to show whatever commands you want. Even the bar at the bottom of the screen can be edited to show more than file name and cursor position. But in truth, a Word partisan could stroll through that program and point out an equal number of much-appreciated features that are available in Word but not in WordPerfect.</p>
        <p>The point is that even with Word's dominance, there is an attractive alternative. And WordPerfect wins hands down by one measure: price. The WordPerfect Office Suite, which includes WordPerfect, spreadsheet, presentations and a couple of other programs, typically sells in stores for about $90.</p>
        <p>Microsoft Office sells for about five times that price.</p>
        <p>You can buy WordPerfect only as a part of the office suite, though you can choose to install only the word processor. Microsoft offers a stand-alone version of Word, which sells for about $275.</p>
        <p>Corel released WordPerfect Version 9.0 in May 1999 and plans to issue Version 10.0 in the first half of next year. Right now, Corel officials say, WordPerfect is in use in most law firms in the United States and Canada, and in many government offices.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department, where the federal antitrust suit against Microsoft was written, uses WordPerfect. The New York attorney general's office, where the companion state antitrust suit was written, uses Word.</p>
        <p>And on the Web site of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the court where Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found Microsoft in wide violation of the nation's antitrust laws and ordered the company broken in two, his rulings are published in three formats: Adobe Acrobat, HTML . . . and WordPerfect.</p>
        <p>STATE OF THE ART  Correction:  September 29, 2000, Friday  The State of the Art column in Circuits on Sept. 21 about Word Perfect software referred incorrectly to the program used in the New York attorney general's office. It is WordPerfect; the office used Microsoft Word in 1998, when the states' antitrust suit against Microsoft was written there.</p>
