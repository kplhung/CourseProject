        <p>A debate may rage over whether leather pants will really be this fall's fashion fetish, but there is one accessory that urban hipsters should not be seen without: Modo. At least that is what Modo's developers will tell you.</p>
        <p>Modo is a walnut-shaped handheld device that displays bite-size chunks of information about a city's dining and entertainment options, updated daily and delivered wirelessly without a subscription fee.</p>
        <p>The device went on sale in New York City last week at Virgin Megastores, DKNY and other stores that try attract the demographic group that Modo's developers are aiming for: people 18 to 34 years old, active, urban and in decent financial straits. The gadget, which can also be bought online at www.Modo.Net, sells for $99.</p>
        <p>Lacking a stylus or keypad, Modo has no aspirations to become a replacement for the Palm organizer or other personal digital assistants.</p>
        <p>''The demographic is different from the button-down professional set,'' said Geoff Pitfield, chief executive of Scout Electromedia, the San Francisco-based company that created the device.</p>
        <p>And it does not try to replicate the services of Vindigo, Zagat's or other downloadable software services that enable people to search for nearby restaurants or movies.</p>
        <p>''The objective is not to be like the Yellow Pages,'' Mr. Pitfield said. ''The idea is to be like your friend.''</p>
        <p>Each day, at least four writers employed by Modo in each city send out blurbs and reviews about whatever they think is buzzworthy: eclectic dance bands or the three best restaurants in a specific neighborhood or the latest movie that everyone is talking about. You can scroll through these reviews or select a feature called Gambles, which picks an event or restaurant at random.</p>
        <p>''If you are saying, 'What are we going to do tonight?' '' Mr. Pitfield said, ''we'll help.''</p>
        <p>If the random entertainment selections don't move the crowd, Modo also features what it calls ''characters'': real people living somewhere in the city who publish their musings on Modo each week. ''It's got a little bit of a soap opera, 'Real World,' voyeuristic feel to it,'' he said. ''That's what we're going for.''</p>
