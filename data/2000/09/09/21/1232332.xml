        <p>A Romantic Natural History, maintained by Dr. Ashton Nichols, a professor of English at Dickinson College, examines the way artists, writers and scientists viewed nature in the century before Charles Darwin published ''On the Origin of Species'' in 1859 (www.dickinson .edu/nicholsa/Romnat/romnat1.htm).</p>
        <p>That 100 years included the work of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, the author of ''Frankenstein''; Carl Linnaeus, who devised the system for naming plants and animals; the fiery poet William Blake; John James Audubon, the nature illustrator; and the writer Henry David Thoreau.</p>
        <p>Visitors to the site, which features several papers by Dr. Nichols and a bibliography, can meander along a timeline that covers the years from 1750 to 1859.</p>
        <p>The timeline offers wonderful juxtapositions, like the publication of Jane Austen's ''Sense and Sensibility'' and the ''New Idea of the Anatomy of the Brain,'' a paper by Charles Bell, in 1811; and the 1832 posthumous publication of ''Faust, Part II,'' by Goethe, followed by an 1834 entry noting the invention of the first computer, an ''analytical engine'' by Charles Babbage.</p>
