        <p>The slumping euro and fuel price inflation quickly took over as the dominant themes today in advance of a meeting of some of the world's top finance officials, with the European currency weakening to a record low and oil prices reaching another 10-year high.</p>
        <p>French leaders, alarmed at the soaring cost of oil and gasoline that has aroused protests across Europe, demanded a unified stand for lower fuel prices when they meet here this weekend among the Group of 7 leading industrial nations. The top official of the International Monetary Fund also warned of the risks of high oil prices and, in unusually blunt remarks, urged the Group of 7 countries to intervene in the currency markets to strengthen the euro.</p>
        <p>The remarks by Horst Kohler, the I.M.F.'s managing director, put pressure on the United States and its partners to attempt their first global currency intervention since their rescue of the falling Japanese yen two years ago.</p>
        <p>The combination of a weak euro and expensive oil is considered especially perilous in Europe just as new signs are emerging that the region's vibrant economy may be slowing. Today, for instance, Italy reported an unexpected slowdown in its quarterly growth rate, and a widely watched indicator of business confidence in Germany fell for the third consecutive month.</p>
        <p>In France, Finance Minister Laurent Fabius asked other big oil-importing nations to jointly demand that oil exporters lower what he called ''the massive and brutal rise in prices.'' He spoke as the commodity price of a barrel of crude oil reached an intraday high of $37.80, settling in New York trading later in the day at $37.20. [page C13.]</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohler, speaking to reporters here in the Czech capital, called the euro ''heavily undervalued'' and urged that central bankers take steps to increase its exchange rate against the dollar and the Japanese yen. ''In my mind it is clear that intervention cannot be a taboo,'' he said. ''My advice is to get the euro back to values based on economic fundamentals.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohler's comments reflected growing worries in Europe not only about the euro's value but also its viability as the region's common currency.</p>
        <p>When 11 West European nations, led by Germany and France, introduced the currency in January 1999, some European leaders thought it might soon displace the dollar as the world's preferred storehouse of value.</p>
        <p>Virtually the opposite has happened. The euro slipped from $1.17 at the start and is now suffering the worst rout of its 20-month life, touching a new low in European trading today of 84.44 cents, then rising somewhat in New York to 84.72 cents.</p>
        <p>Along with the increasing price of oil, which Mr. Kohler said had put growth prospects in many importing countries at risk, the I.M.F. has stressed that the weak euro could undermine generally optimistic prospects for the global economy.</p>
        <p>The euro's diminished value means that much of the Continent must pay more for imported goods, pushing up inflation and potentially forcing the European Central Bank to raise interest rates. That would slow growth in the region, which along with the United States economy has contributed to the strongest world growth in more than a decade.</p>
        <p>Even more disconcerting for European policy makers, the currency's tumble comes a few days before Denmark is scheduled to vote on whether to adopt the euro. New polls show that Danes have turned decidedly negative on the euro as their Sept. 28 referendum approaches, a serious blow to proponents of the single currency, who hope to expand its domain to include other European nations, especially Britain.</p>
        <p>The weak euro also has an impact in the United States by strengthening the relative value of an already strong dollar. Though the dollar has been a cornerstone of America's long economic expansion, import-loving Americans have helped amass a huge trade deficit, now 4.3 percent of the gross domestic product, a level many economists consider too high.</p>
        <p>''There is a serious psychological bubble that has pushed the euro way down and the dollar way up,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, ''and it could do some serious damage. My conclusion is that the only way they are going to turn this around is with a positive psychological shock'' -- concerted intervention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bergsten said the leading powers should repeat their rescue operation of the sagging Japanese yen during the Asian financial crisis, in 1998. At that time, the United States, Europe and Japan coordinated an effort to buy yen and scared off speculators who had been driving the yen down. The yen rebounded, rising by almost a third against the dollar and has remained largely stable.</p>
        <p>When the Group of 7 finance ministers meet this weekend, they will face the issue of whether -- and how -- to grapple with the euro.</p>
        <p>The markets are betting that they will debate over words more than deeds. The customary joint communique at the end of the meeting will be scrutinized for semantics, especially any official endorsement of the idea that the euro has fallen below its fundamental value. It is also possible that they will emerge with an agreement, possibly secret, to sell dollars and buy euros at an opportune moment -- though that is regarded as less likely.</p>
        <p>Several senior European officials have signaled that they favor intervention, but Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers has so far shown no interest in joining them. Without American participation, any intervention will carry a high risk of failure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Summers reiterated today that the United States policy favoring a strong dollar remains in force. He has often said that he prefers to allow the market to set currency values. He seems especially unlikely to alter that philosophy with the presidential election ahead.</p>
        <p>Any intervention could fail, embarrassing the Clinton administration. Or it could work too well, pushing the euro up sharply at the expense of the dollar and making the American trade deficit -- now projected at $354 billion this year -- unsustainable, weakening the economy and hurting Vice President Al Gore's campaign.</p>
