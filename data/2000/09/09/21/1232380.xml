        <p>Using the same language that some critics used against him and former President George Bush after the Persian Gulf war nearly 10 years ago, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today accused the Clinton administration of letting Saddam Hussein ''slip off the hook'' by avoiding weapons inspections.</p>
        <p>''For a period of time there, in the aftermath of the gulf war, we had a very robust inspection regime under way,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''We had people in there all the time, checking out, making certain that he wasn't going back trying to rebuild his biological and chemical capabilities.''</p>

        <p>Using the same language that some critics used against him and former President George Bush after the Persian Gulf war nearly 10 years ago, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today accused the Clinton administration of letting Saddam Hussein ''slip off the hook'' by avoiding weapons inspections.</p>
        <p>''For a period of time there, in the aftermath of the gulf war, we had a very robust inspection regime under way,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''We had people in there all the time, checking out, making certain that he wasn't going back trying to rebuild his biological and chemical capabilities.''</p>
        <p>''Now,'' he said, ''we've seen a situation develop in which he's kicked out all the inspectors and this administration appears to be helpless to do anything about it. We're at the point where I think we have not seen the kind of aggressive, effective leadership that President Bush provided with respect to the coalition.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney made the charge at a campaign stop in Lancaster, Calif., that began with a teary recollection of the day the ground war began in the Persian Gulf. His words were reminiscent of critics of the Bush administration, who said it let Mr. Hussein off the hook by ending the war while he was still in power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney made the accusation against President Clinton in response to a question from the audience after he delivered a speech on the need for increasing the military's research and development budget. The campaign chose Lancaster for the speech because it is in the middle of California's Antelope Valley, a hub of the aerospace industry.</p>
        <p>Surrounding himself with former pilots and astronauts -- including Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon, and Col. Gordon Fullerton, a retired space shuttle commander -- Mr. Cheney declared, ''These individuals had the right stuff, but they also had the right support.''</p>
        <p>Later, speaking at a solar cell factory here, he criticized aspects of the United States mission to Somalia, saying that the troops did not get all the necessary equipment and that the objective was at times ''fuzzy.''</p>
        <p>In past appearances, Mr. Cheney has been questioned on why the Bush administration did not continue the gulf war until Mr. Hussein was driven from power. He has answered that the object was to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, not to depose Mr. Hussein, and that the international coalition would have been pulled apart if the United States had continued.</p>
        <p>The United States and Iraq have long tussled over arms inspections,  and in late 1998, the United States and Britain conducted four nights of air strikes to punish Mr. Hussein's government for its refusal to cooperate with inspectors. Since then, the administration has grown increasingly reluctant to consider force. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said last week that the United States would not use force to make Iraq allow inspections to resume.</p>
        <p>The gulf war was on people's minds from the beginning of the day. Mr. Cheney was introduced here, as he often is, by his wife, Lynne, who enjoys telling anecdotes about him along the campaign trail. Today her voice began to quaver as she spoke about the morning after the ground war in the gulf began and recounted a quiet trip she and her husband made to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington.</p>
        <p>''Gosh, I'm getting teary just thinking about this,'' Mrs. Cheney said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, who removed his glasses and wiped his eyes before speaking, said, ''Lynne, we're going to have to work on that introduction some.''</p>
