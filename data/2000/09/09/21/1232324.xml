        <p>Cliff Bayer will long remember the last touch of Kim Young Ho's sword to his stomach today, the one that crushed his chance of advancing to fencing glory. Bayer came to the Summer Olympics trying to ignore the hopes of his team and his federation that come with winning two World Cup fencing titles in the last year and being 12th-ranked in foil in the world.</p>
        <p>He wanted to prove that an American fencer was the equal of his foreign competition and that he was better than he was as an anxious 19-year-old who lost his first bout at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Bayer had never faced Kim before but was wary of the resilience he had seen when the South Korean came back from an 8-point deficit to win a world championship match.</p>
        <p>''He was the one guy I really didn't want to face,'' Bayer said. ''When I saw him in my bracket, I was nervous. He's smart, really smart.''</p>
        <p>In their match today, the second for each man, Bayer was cruising, up by 11-7, 13-10, then 14-13. But Kim knotted the bout, then ducked under an attack by Bayer and countered with the final touch.</p>
        <p>''I'll be seeing that for a long time,'' said Bayer, who works out of the New York Athletic Club and is on a sabbatical from attending the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. ''I just missed. It's a heartbreaker.''</p>
        <p>Kim, 29, inflicted heartache on three more opponents to win a gold medal, staging riveting, methodical comebacks against Dmitri Chevtchenko of Russia in the semifinal and Ralf Bissdorf of Germany in the final. Three of Kim's victories came by 15-14 scores. ''I didn't want it that way,'' Kim said through an interpreter. ''I want to win from the beginning.''</p>
        <p>In fencing, the first to score 15 points wins; if no one reaches 15, the most touches after three three-minute rounds wins.</p>
        <p>Throughout his bout with Bissdorf, Kim stalled frequently, doing nothing, avoiding contact while pointing his foil at Bissdorf across the strip, measuring, or maybe, lulling the German. The tactic seemed to give each man a respite, but Kim could only describe it as a defense against a Bissdorf attack. Later, the South Korean said his ability to come back against Bayer, Chevtchenko and Bissdorf was by means of a ''a skill, where I have to stretch my arm if I'm not as tall as he is.''</p>
        <p>''I practiced it for three months,'' Kim said. ''It's an attack, a stretch.'' Kim is 5 feet 11 inches; Bissdorf stands 6-2.</p>
        <p>Whatever it was, it worked, and Bissdorf understood. ''He likes to attack and he attacks very well,'' the German said. ''I do, too. But we didn't attack each other as much because our defenses were so good. Today we had a real good fight. At 14-14, my strategy was not enough. His was excellent.''</p>
        <p>Kim may have succeeded because he adapted his style to suit his foe.</p>
        <p>Against Chevtchenko, he was a Joe Frazier-like plodder, a tough guy repelling the 6-4 Russian's trademark running charge, like an irate bull, down the strip. Their bout had all the wondrous excitement of a late-in-the National Basketball Association game Hack-a-Shaq strategy.</p>
        <p>Against the lean Bissdorf, Kim seemed to mimic the German's style, as they stretched their scoring into early in the third period. Bissdorf seemed to be in command at 9-6, but Kim rallied with five unanswered touches and stretched the lead to 13-10, before Bissdorf tied Kim at 14. When Kim won the decisive point, his coach rushed onto the stage at the Sydney Exhibition Center and tackled him, while Bissdorf stood to the side, waiting to congratulate him.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know if I was dreaming,'' Kim said. ''I didn't know if it was reality. I thought about my wife, my mother, my son. History was being made. This is the first gold for Korea in the men's individual.''</p>
