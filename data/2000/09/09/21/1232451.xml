        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read with much amusement ''Good Screen Names Are Hard to Find and Getting Harder'' (Sept. 7). I'd like to offer another suggestion for selecting a screen name: using an anagram of one's name. That is the route I took when selecting a personal e-mail address. I'm fairly sure that there are already kwadsworth's and kimw's online by the score, so I didn't even attempt to try those screen names.</p>

I'm fairly sure that there are already kwadsworth's and kimw's online by the score, so I didn't even attempt to try those screen names.</p>
        <p>Some time ago, I learned that one possible anagram of my full name is the nonsense phrase ''wrinkly and her wombats,'' and I tried that instead, guessing -- correctly, as it turned out -- that the odds were vanishingly small for someone else beating me to using this phrase.</p>
