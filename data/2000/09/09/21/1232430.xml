        <p>With Yugoslavia's presidential election only days away, the two main rivals held competing rallies here tonight, speaking as if to two separate nations, with President Slobodan Milosevic taking up the fight for his future in an extraordinarily personal fashion.</p>
        <p>For the first time in memory, Mr. Milosevic made two appearances in a single day, delivering slashing attacks on opposition leaders at rallies in Montenegro and later tonight in Belgrade, calling them ''rabbits, rats and even hyenas'' who had ''the loyalty of dogs'' to the NATO masters ''who bribe and pay them.''</p>
        <p>Tonight in Belgrade his main opponent, Vojislav Kostunica, appeared before an enormous excited crowd estimated at 100,000, urging them to vote for his own vision of ''a normal European democratic country'' where ''the government is not afraid of the people, and the people are not afraid of their government.''</p>
        <p>The election is Sunday, and the campaign has suddenly seemed to take on weight and moment, with Mr. Milosevic trying to beat back the challenge of those he considers traitors, while the opposition gathered courage from numbers and from the obvious nervousness of the regime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, hoarse and tired from his campaign of retail politics all over Serbia, urged courage on the crowd, saying, ''There is a great chance and hope that after these elections, we will begin a new life in different Serbia.''</p>
        <p>Rather than a country ''that is hostage to one man,'' he said, ''I know you want to live in a good, democratic European state, one that is free inside and free abroad, too, that is independent, with a normal economy, industry, banking system, social and health care and media.''</p>
        <p>The crowd shouted slogans like ''He's finished!'' about Mr. Milosevic, and ''Save Serbia from this madhouse, Kostunica!'' (pronounced KOSH-too-nee-tsa).</p>
        <p>The mood was happy, helped by the performance of two famous Yugoslav musicians, Bajaga and Bora Djordjevic, who endorsed Mr. Kostunica. Nebojsa Ristic, a television journalist jailed for 339 days by the government for supporting free speech, also spoke to endorse Mr. Kostunica.</p>
        <p>Speaking on an outdoor stage in front of the Parliament, Mr. Kostunica was flanked by the leaders of 18 opposition parties who chose him as their joint candidate. While some have said they are uncomfortable with his deeply felt nationalism, they decided that Mr. Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer, was their best answer to Mr. Milosevic's appeal to Serbian patriotism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, both in his speech and an earlier appearance on state television, spoke in strong terms tonight about ''NATO's criminal bombing of Yugoslavia'' last year and the damage the war did ''to the international legal order.''</p>
        <p>He repeated his assertion that the tribunal in The Hague that indicted Mr. Milosevic for war crimes at the end of the Kosovo war ''is an American tribunal -- not a court, but a political instrument.''</p>
        <p>And he said again that he disagreed with the indictment of Mr. Milosevic, ''which puts Serbia in a difficult position'' and gives Mr. Milosevic ''no way out except to make the whole country his hostage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic's appearance in Montenegro was his first visit to Serbia's sister republic in four years, and he went to a carefully protected military airfield in Berane, just across the border from Serbia, an indication of how little he can call this republic his own.</p>
        <p>The president of the Montenegro republic, Milo Djukanovic, split with Mr. Milosevic in 1998 and has turned to the West while edging toward independence from Serbia. Mr. Djukanovic has urged a boycott of the Yugoslav elections, but up to a third of Montenegro's 440,000 voters are likely to cast ballots in any case.</p>
        <p>In slashing style before some 10,000 people, Mr. Milosevic mocked Mr. Djukanovic and Serbia's opposition leaders as those ''bribed and blackmailed by the mighty,'' calling them rats ''who want to turn this great nation into a permed poodle.''</p>
        <p>He said that Mr. Djukanovic would surrender Montenegro's true freedom and independence, and that its traditional musical instruments and costumes would be reduced to museum exhibits ''for American stars and British spinsters to see after they swim free on the beaches of Sveti Stefan,'' a famous Montenegrin resort.</p>
        <p>While bellicose, he was also conciliatory, urging Montenegrins to carefully consider their future. ''I think your interests are to live with Serbia, but it is up to you whether or not you wish to live with Serbia or if you choose another way,'' he said. ''Whatever happens, I wish you good luck.''</p>
        <p>In a conservative blue suit and white shirt, Mr. Milosevic appeared confident. ''How long Yugoslavia will survive will depend on the Montenegrin and Serbian people,'' he said. ''If they want to live together, no one will be able to separate them.''</p>
        <p>The crowd, many bused in from other parts of northern Montenegro and some from Serbia, cheered and clapped for Mr. Milosevic, who stayed barely 35 minutes, shouting, ''We love you, Slobo!'' and ''We are all Yugoslavia!''</p>
        <p>He then returned to Belgrade, apparently by helicopter, for a second rally tonight, opening a sports hall orginally begun for a 1994 world basketball championship that international sanctions made impossible to hold here.</p>
        <p>Speaking before a conservatively dressed crowd estimated at 15,000 people, who gave him standing ovations and rhythmic applause, Mr. Milosevic continued to attack his opposition as tools of the same Western countries that bombed Yugoslavia. He said the opposition was inspired by the West ''to spread terrorism and crime'' and ''to destroy families through religious sects, spy groups and drug lords.''</p>
        <p>''Those alleged political parties, united or on their own -- it makes no difference -- are tasked with spreading lies and defeatism, provoking crime and terrorism, inciting chauvinism,'' he said. He accused the opposition of ''abusing children and youth through sects and other intelligence organizations, terrorist groups and the narco-mafia.''</p>
        <p>His appearance in Montenegro was the main feature on state television, whose news broadcast was also shown simultaneously on every channel in Belgrade, something unprecedented even during the war, when state television was bombed by the Atlantic alliance. (One young girl of seven was infuriated when ''Baywatch'' was pre-empted by Mr. Milosevic in Montenegro, asking her mother whether something was wrong with the television.)</p>
        <p>Opposition politicians interpreted Mr. Milosevic's appeareances as a sign of nervousness about the results of the election; he continues to trail Mr. Kostunica in the polls.</p>
        <p>If no one wins more than 50 percent of the vote on Sunday, a runoff between the two top finishers will be held two weeks later. But opposition leaders say Mr. Milosevic will find a way -- even through electoral fraud -- to declare victory in the first round.</p>
        <p>The opposition also appealed today to the army and the police not to let themselves be used to save Mr. Milosevic if he loses the elections. ''Your sacred duty is to defend the country and peace in it, and this means to respect the will of the people,'' the opposition said.</p>
        <p>As if in response, the chief of staff of the Yugoslav military, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, said tonight that the army would accept Mr. Kostunica as head of state if he wins the elections. General Pavkovic, who has come out in open support of Mr. Milosevic, repeated his view that the military will support the elected head of state.</p>
        <p>''There is no debate over the fact that the military will accept the victory of Vojislav Kostunica if he is elected president,'' the general said on Montenegrin state television.</p>
        <p>It was less clear what would happen if both Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Kostunica declare victory, or if the opposition goes into the streets to protest a rigged victory by Mr. Milosevic.</p>
