        <p>MANHATTAN: TAMING TIMES SQUARE -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he would decide within the next two weeks whether to proceed with a long-awaited plan to widen sidewalks along Seventh Avenue and Broadway in Times Square. ''The competition for space is ferocious, and the resulting pedestrian environment is significantly impeded by obstructed sidewalks, conflicts with traffic, and poor directional and informational signs,'' said a report released by the mayor's office yesterday. It was prepared jointly by the Department of City Planning and Department of Transportation. Mr. Giuliani said the first phase of the plan, installation of simpler street signs, would begin immediately.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: $19 MILLION AWARD UPHELD -- A Staten Island man's $19 million personal injury award was upheld yesterday by a state appellate court. The man, John Brown, now 35, and his brother Virgil, 36, became quadriplegics after diving off a pier on Coney Island in 1992. Their lawyer, Harvey Weitz, argued in court that although the water was only 5 feet deep, the city had failed to post No Diving signs. Virgil Brown, was awarded $19 million as well, but the appellate court asked that a jury reconsider whether the city was 100 percent liable, Mr. Weitz said.</p>

        <p>HAUPPAUGE: COMPUTERIZED CANCER 'MAP' -- The National Cancer Institute held public meetings yesterday on a $4.8 million computerized mapping system to help researchers and citizens groups determine the causes of Long Island's elevated incidences of cancer. The effort is part of a $27 million study of cancer on Long Island. Computerized maps and other data will not be available until May, said a spokeswoman, Linda Anderson, but information can be found on the Web at http://www.healthgis-li.com.</p>

        <p>NEW YORK STATE: EXPERTS' WEB SITE -- To encourage businesses to consult professors and others in academia, more than 100 private colleges and universities have established a Web site listing research centers and institutes that have experts in 13 areas central to New York's economy. Albert J. Simone, president of the Rochester Institute of Technology and chairman of the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities, said yesterday that through the site, http://www .cicu.org, experts could be found to help with training and other services.</p>

        <p>BUFFALO: SCHOOL CONTRACT APPROVAL -- The Buffalo Board of Education yesterday unanimously approved a five-year contract recommended by a state mediator, ending a strike by union teachers. On Tuesday, the Executive Committee of the Buffalo Teachers Federation approved the pact, subject to the school board vote. Teachers are to meet tomorrow for a final vote. The contract, which is retroactive to July 1, 1999, provides for raises of about 13 percent over its life. To balance the increases, teachers will pay more for their health insurance when they retire.</p>

        <p>THE BRONX: SUSPECT MAY HAVE STRUCK AGAIN -- A man who sexually assaulted three girls on their way to St. Thomas Aquinas High School last week as well as a 24-year-old woman on her way to Public School 205 may have struck again, the police said. At 8 a.m. yesterday, a man who fit the same description exposed himself to two girls, ages 14 and 16, near East 163rd Street and Washington Avenue, the authorities said. The police described the assailant as a dark-skinned Hispanic man in his 20's, between 5 feet 8 inches and 6 feet tall, with a short afro haircut. He was seen driving a blue 2000 Dodge minivan.</p>

        <p>BRIDGEWATER: REWARD IN BIAS CRIMES -- The Anti-Defamation League is offering a $7,500 reward for the indictment and conviction of those who have been spraying swastikas and other anti-Semitic graffiti and of those who have been making threats against Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Mayor James Dowden over the last two years. The league's regional director, Charles Goldstein, denounced the graffiti, left on signs, benches and seats, as a combination of bias crimes and attempts to undercut democracy. ''This is a crime against the whole community,'' Mayor Dowden said yesterday.</p>

        <p>SOUTH ORANGE: SETON HALL FALSE ALARMS -- The sensitive fire alarm system installed in Seton Hall University's seven residential halls after the fatal dormitory fire in January has inadvertently been touched off six times this semester by students taking hot showers, the university said. The two latest incidents occurred yesterday afternoon in Xavier and Cabrini Halls, forcing all students to leave. ''The system has been adjusted as much as it can be while maintaining the utmost in safety,'' said a university spokesman, Molly McDonough.</p>

        <p>WOODBRIDGE: A.T.M. FEES UPHELD -- After opposition from the banking industry, Woodbridge and Newark have agreed to drop attempts to ban fees at automated teller machines, officials said. Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge said the Township Council voted Tuesday night to rescind the ban, which had already been temporarily blocked by a federal judge in Newark pending the outcome of a lawsuit by the New Jersey Bankers Association to overturn it. Newark, too, was sued by the bankers association, although Mayor Sharpe James had threatened to veto a ban.</p>

        <p>STONINGTON: TRIBAL RECOGNITION SOUGHT -- Another group from southeastern Connecticut is seeking official federal recognition as an Indian tribe, becoming at least the third group to claim that its members are descendants of the historic Eastern Pequot tribe of Native Americans. The group, the Wiquapaug Eastern Pequots, filed a letter of intent this month with the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. Federal recognition brings numerous benefits, including the possibility of casino gambling. Two other groups have won preliminary recognition, although their applications have been opposed by the state attorney general and others.</p>
