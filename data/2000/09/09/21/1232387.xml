        <p>The Ford Motor Company acknowledged today that it had used a pickup truck, and not an Explorer sports utility vehicle, to test Bridgestone/Firestone tires at low air pressure, despite submitting an affidavit of a retired worker that implied that an Explorer was used.</p>
        <p>Congressional investigators quickly seized on the discrepancy, and Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, who plans to conduct a second hearing on Thursday on the tendency of the tires to fail and the vehicles to roll over, plans to ask whether the intent was to mislead Congress, according to a member of his staff.</p>
        <p>Also today, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously approved legislation that would establish criminal penalties for failing to notify the government of safety defects if those defects result in death or serious injury.</p>
        <p>And Ford said that regulators were looking into failures of a part in the front suspension of 1995 and 1996 Explorers, although the company said that the problem did not appear to cause anything more than noises under the hood and ''vague handling.''</p>
        <p>With the number of deaths in tire-related Explorer rollover accidents apparently more than 100, a key question is the discrepancy between Firestone's recommended inflation level, 30 pounds per square inch, and Ford's, a range of 26 to 30 pounds.</p>
        <p>Congressional investigators have been seeking to establish what tests were done at 26 pounds, because lower pressure leads to more flexing of the tire sidewall, producing more heat which can encourage tire failure.</p>
        <p>Ford officials called reporters this afternoon to say that the tests, two hours in the hot Arizona desert at more than 90 miles per hour, had been conducted in 1989 using a Ford F-150 pickup truck.</p>
        <p>They used the truck, officials said, because the V-6 engine used on the original Explorers probably could not have run the vehicle that fast for that long on a day when the temperature was at least 90 degrees, as the test required. In fact, they said, the prototype vehicles available at the time the test was run were probably too frail to run that fast.</p>
        <p>While the F-150 is not an Explorer, ''it mimics it perfectly,'' said Jason Vines, a spokesman for Ford. Because of the way the suspension is set up and the weight is distributed, ''the tire believes the vehicle is an Explorer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Mr. Tauzin, the chairman of the House Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection, said: ''It might resemble an Explorer, but it's not an Explorer. That's the whole point.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''We will have legislation to solve that problem in the future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson also said that investigators had found records of tire tests done in 1996 at Firestone's Decatur, Ill., plant, where many of the defective tires were produced. Of 229 tires randomly tested, 31 failed a standard test of 10 minutes at 112 miles an hour, he said. The tire is supposed to last for 10 minutes but ''they started peeling like bananas a couple of minutes into the test,'' he said. Of the 31, 20 were tread separations, he said, adding, ''Someone at Firestone had to know they were having problems,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Firestone, Julia Sutherland, reached this evening, said she was not familiar with the document.</p>
        <p>Ford, meanwhile, said it was looking into the part in the front suspension, a sway bar link, that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had asked about. The part helps keep the vehicle from leaning too far during turns.</p>
        <p>Ford said its own database of complaints showed that they came mainly from northern states where road salt, a cause of corrosion, is used for melting snow. The company believes the highway traffic agency will open an investigation.</p>
        <p>Asked if the failures were a safety problem, Mr. Vines said, ''everything we see says no.'' He added, ''In the end, we'll do the right thing for our customers.''</p>
        <p>While the House committee discusses legislation, the Senate Commerce Committee passed a bill, sponsored by Senator John McCain of Arizona, the committee chairman, that would establish criminal penalties for knowingly violating an existing law that requires manufacturers to notify the government about defects. It would also have the Government establish rules for reporting by companies of warranty claims and crashes.</p>
        <p>But the idea was immediately attacked by the United States Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>''Criminalization at the heat of the moment may sound like a good thing,'' said Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the chamber. ''But does everybody understand that criminalization take precedence over civil law?''</p>
        <p>Manufacturers would refuse to turn over records to government regulators or Congress, he said, for fear of incriminating themselves. ''You've now defeated the open flow to the very authorities and the American public that need to know.''</p>
