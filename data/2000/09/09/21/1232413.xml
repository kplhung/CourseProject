        <p>Federal prosecutors in Salt Lake City have decided not to file any charges in the death of a 19-year-old man who was beaten by fellow passengers last month after he broke into the cockpit of a Southwest Airlines flight to Salt Lake City from Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>As many as eight of the 120 passengers on the Boeing 737 subdued the man, Jonathan Burton of Las Vegas, who was removed from the jet after it landed and taken to a Salt Lake City hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

        <p>Federal prosecutors in Salt Lake City have decided not to file any charges in the death of a 19-year-old man who was beaten by fellow passengers last month after he broke into the cockpit of a Southwest Airlines flight to Salt Lake City from Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>As many as eight of the 120 passengers on the Boeing 737 subdued the man, Jonathan Burton of Las Vegas, who was removed from the jet after it landed and taken to a Salt Lake City hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Federal investigators and prosecutors declined to provide details of the incident or the inquiry that followed, including the names of the other passengers involved in the incident.</p>
        <p>But the United States attorney for Utah, Paul M. Warner, who concluded last week that the death was a homicide, said the passengers who subdued Mr. Burton acted out of self-defense and did not demonstrate ''criminal intent,'' at least not to the extent that prosecutors believed they could win a conviction in court.</p>
        <p>Ed Stewart, a spokesman for the airline, said today that it was ''crystal clear'' that Mr. Burton was trying to disrupt the flight, calling his actions ''less an example of air rage than an attempted hijacking.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stewart said Mr. Burton tried several times to break in the cockpit door, succeeding on his third attempt, which prompted the passengers to wrestle him to the floor.</p>
        <p>''By all accounts,'' Mr. Stewart said, ''he was hitting everybody. It was a matter of trying to restrain him. By his third attempt to get into the cockpit, children were crying, it was pandemonium. People were in panic. Everybody who had him grabbed an arm or a leg. One guy trying to grab him wound up with a busted lip.''</p>
        <p>At least one passenger on the flight, a Canadian who was not interviewed by American investigators, offered an account suggesting that one passenger, more than the others, might have caused some of the injuries that led to Mr. Burton's death.</p>
        <p>Dean Harvey, who was traveling with his wife and infant son on the Aug. 11 flight, told The Edmonton Journal that during the altercation he saw ''a burly man'' jump onto Mr. Burton's chest repeatedly.</p>
        <p>''I asked him to stop,'' Mr. Harvey was quoted as saying in an article in today's edition of The Journal. ''I said, 'You've got the guy subdued. What more do you want? You don't have to pound his head in.' The guy was being held with his arms outstretched. He had no chance to absorb the shock.''</p>
        <p>A lawyer representing Mr. Burton's family, Kent Spence of Jackson, Wyo., said today that he was unaware that a passenger had publicly described what he saw on the flight. Mr. Spence, the son of a prominent defense lawyer, Gerry Spence, said neither the Federal Bureau of Investigation, federal prosecutors nor Southwest Airlines would share any information about the incident or the investigation, other than the medical examiner's autopsy report.</p>
        <p>That report said that Mr. Burton suffered injuries to his torso, face and neck and died of suffocation and that when police arrived, ''Mr. Burton was lying face down with at least one individual standing on his neck.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spence said that Mr. Burton's family, which includes his mother, Janet, and two older brothers, Craig, 21, and Brad, 23, had not decided whether to file a wrongful death lawsuit. But, he said, he would try to contact Mr. Harvey to hear his version of events.</p>
        <p>Jim Matthews, a spokesman for the Salt Lake City office of the F.B.I., said investigators had interviewed ''most everybody on the plane, those we could locate,'' and included the results of the interviews in a report to prosecutors.</p>
        <p>Federal agents could not find Mr. Harvey until Tuesday, Mr. Matthews said, and today were trying to arrange a time to interview him.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Matthews stressed that agents wanted to talk to Mr. Harvey ''out of the course of business, like any other passenger, not because he made any fantastic claims.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harvey's telephone number in Edmonton is not listed.</p>
        <p>According to his account to The Journal, Mr. Harvey and his wife, Flavia, saw Mr. Burton ''flying down the aisle toward the cockpit, yelling, 'I can fly this plane! I can fly this plane!' ''</p>
        <p>With about 20 minutes left in the 75-minute flight, Mr. Harvey told the newspaper, he saw Mr. Burton break through the cockpit door.</p>
        <p>''He reaches right in with both arms and grabs each pilot, one with each arm,'' he said, adding that Mr. Burton was then surrounded and restrained by five people, including the man who began jumping on him.</p>
        <p>Melody Rydalch, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office in Salt Lake City, said Mr. Warner decided not to pursue a prosecution because he did not believe he could gain a homicide conviction, which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Matthews said the results of the interview with Mr. Harvey would be sent to the prosecutors to consider whether his account provided sufficient reason to re-examine the case. Despite Mr. Harvey's account, though, Mr. Matthews said he did not believe agents would spend much more time on the case.</p>
        <p>''In general, once they decline to prosecute, we're finished,'' he said.</p>
