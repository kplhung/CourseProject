        <p>His is the other reunion, the silent sideshow to Keyshawn Johnson's full-color, surround-sound carnival of trash talk and bruised ego.</p>
        <p>Under cover of the verbal barrage by his former teammate, Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde is sneaking ever so quietly back to Tampa, Fla., this week to face the team that made him the first overall pick in the 1987 draft and, eventually, the scapegoat for a failing franchise.</p>
        <p>It will be the first time he has returned to Tampa in the regular season.</p>
        <p>The Buccaneers never won more than six games a season during Testaverde's six-year stint, and their fans could not wait to usher him out of town. The sharp edges of that experience have been dulled by the seven years that have passed since Testaverde left, initially as a free agent for Cleveland, and by the comfortable life he now enjoys.</p>
        <p>Testaverde has the success and the respect with the Jets that he never had in Tampa Bay, and yet he still owns a sprawling lakefront home 20 minutes from the Bucs' home, Raymond James Stadium.</p>
        <p>For all the vitriol in the comments by Tampa Bay's Johnson about the Jets, Testaverde's feelings about the Buccaneers are so lacking in heat that there was an off-season rumor that he might want to return there to close out his career. Testaverde denied those rumors, but said he makes his home in Tampa because it is a good place to raise a family and because he has never had an uncomfortable encounter with fans outside the stadium.</p>
        <p>''I think it's just going to be another game for me,'' Testaverde said today. ''The things I went through at Tampa made me a better person, made me a better player. I don't think I could have reached this level if I didn't go through some of those experiences.</p>
        <p>''At times, it was disappointing when I was down there, but at the same time, I tried to continue to work hard and stay confident in my ability as a quarterback to know I can play in the N.F.L., regardless of what was being said.''</p>
        <p>What was being said was not complimentary. Tampa Bay had won a total of four games in the two seasons preceding its selection of Testaverde, who had won the Heisman Trophy. He started four games his rookie season, setting what was then a single-game record for rookies in his debut with 369 yards on 22 of 47 passing. But Testaverde's numbers slid dramatically.</p>
        <p>He never had a season in which he threw more touchdowns than interceptions. In 1988, his first full season as a starter, Testaverde completed only 47.6 percent of his passes and threw 13 touchdowns and an astonishing 35 interceptions. In six seasons with Tampa Bay, he completed 1,126 of 2,160 passes (52.1 percent) with 77 touchdowns and 112 interceptions.</p>
        <p>In only one other season of his career -- his second season in Cleveland -- did Testaverde have more interceptions than touchdowns. In 1998 with the Jets, he completed 259 of 421 passes (61.5 percent) for 29 touchdowns, and he threw 7 interceptions.</p>
        <p>When Testaverde became a free agent after the 1992 season, he wanted to move on, although he had the chance to stay in Tampa.</p>
        <p>''When you go through things like that, it makes you a stronger person,'' he said. ''It would be easy for me to sit here and fire back at certain individuals. I've never been a vindictive person. We were a young team; we were inexperienced. We weren't very good. I was the same way. Over time, with experience, I think I've become a much better quarterback. There were a lot of expectations put on me.''</p>
        <p>There are similar expectations now. Testaverde spoke during the last off-season of wanting to return from the injury that ended his 1999 season, a torn Achilles' tendon, to reach the level he had attained in 1998, when the Jets were on the brink of a Super Bowl appearance.</p>
        <p>Although the Jets are 3-0, Testaverde's play has come under scrutiny simply because he has not yet reached the Pro Bowl form he had in 1998. Testaverde has completed 55 of 113 passes (48.7 percent) for 730 yards, 5 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. Occasionally his timing has been off and he has produced touchdowns on only 19.4 percent of the drives he has led this season.</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh said he was unconcerned about Testaverde's slow start.</p>
        <p>''Quarterbacks are judged by two things: getting the team in the end zone and scoring more points than the other team,'' Groh said. ''In that respect, he's establishing a pretty good record with the Jets.''</p>
        <p>Testaverde thinks that the subtle changes in the defenses since 1998, particularly in the different ways they line up, have steepened his comeback curve this season. Against Tampa Bay, the Jets' offense will face one of the league's most fearsome defenses.</p>
        <p>''It's like writing about football every day and then they ask you to write about a tennis match,'' Testaverde said. ''Maybe you're not too familiar with it. Each week, I've felt better. I felt more comfortable dropping back, seeing the field, seeing the defense. That's all part of getting back into it. Sometimes you may get frustrated. I try not to. To this point, it's worked for us.''</p>
        <p>During the off-season, while Testaverde was rehabilitating his leg in his own weight room at home, he was constantly reminded of another big game that will be played in Tampa at the end of this season. With the Jets off to their surprising start, that game seems closer to home than ever.</p>
        <p>''All off-season I heard on the news how the Super Bowl is in Tampa and how great it would be for the Tampa Bay Bucs to be in the Super Bowl, which would be the first time in N.F.L. history that the host city would have their own team,'' Testaverde said. ''But at the same time I'm thinking I'd love to play in it, too, because that's where I started my career. That's where I live.</p>
        <p>''It would be a great place to play in my first Super Bowl as well. Every year, you come into camp very optimistic, but yet there's some uncertainty when you go through changes, like we have. But as the season continues forward and you're winning, I think your dreams are closer to becoming reality.''</p>
