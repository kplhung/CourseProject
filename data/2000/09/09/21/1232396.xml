        <p>Harvey Parrott, who hunts wild turkeys in his breathtaking native countryside hereabouts, could not believe his eyes and slammed on the brakes of his vehicle on the narrow forest road.</p>
        <p>''You're gonna do what?'' he asked, incredulous as a young  woman peered 200 feet down into the creek-side melange of the Adkins Town Road dump, an illegal eyesore mushrooming at the bottom of a mountain hollow. She had to tell him twice that the mess would be rooted up and out by next spring, to the very last bedspring, horse cadaver and rat's nest.</p>
        <p>''And we'll plant grass seed and put TV cameras on it after,'' said  the woman, Karen Engle, the director of a determined citizens' cleanup movement, as she studied the fetid jumble below, one of the countless ''holler dumps'' that long have pocked the beauty of Appalachia.</p>
        <p>''Well, I been sick and so sad about that dump forever,'' said Mr. Parrott, who lives just up the switchback road. Delighted with the news, he was doubtful that friends and neighbors could ever be stopped from blithely tipping tons of trash, including worn-out sofas, broken appliances and food scraps, down the hillside.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Engle was here to tell him the news: 40 counties of eastern Kentucky, intent on scrubbing forth a new national image, have banded together to root out the countless festering garbage dumps and the pipes that dump raw sewage into creeks and ditches, features that long have broadcast a stereotype of backwoods fecklessness in Appalachia.</p>
        <p>The eastern Kentucky effort, called Pride (Personal Responsibility in a Desirable Environment), an alliance of federal, state and volunteer workers, was considered politically risky when it was conceived four years ago by the local congressman, Representative Harold Rogers, and the state secretary of natural resources, James E. Bickford.</p>
        <p>After all, even with the opening of modern legal landfills, the traditions of impoverished mountain hamlets and mining camps die hard. With no organized sanitation for much of the 20th century, rural residents had long tolerated the netherworld cascade of holler dumps and the post-outhouse ''straight-pipe'' way of sanitation from mobile homes and simple cottages -- sewage primitively piped straight out into the Great Outdoors.</p>
        <p>But the cleanup has quietly caught on, with 1,996 dumps mapped and turned into targets by searchers so far and 377 of them eliminated. The worst of them required a 7,000-ton, $1 million engineering feat, said Ms. Engle, executive director of Pride, a nonprofit agency of six workers who coordinate the effort. Owners of the first 36,000 straight-pipe sources of pollution, a minority of the overall problem, are being offered low-interest loans of $1,500 for septic tanks or sewer linkups, and 2,600 of them are signed up.</p>
        <p>The effort has cost $70 million so far in federal money, plus in-kind services and equipment, like video security, from state and local workers. Mr. Rogers tailored a change in federal law allowing the Army Corps of Engineers, long identified with massive river-control programs, to pursue subtler backwoods needs here. The corps has created wetland lagoons to treat sewage from mountain hollows and introduced trash-skimming boats and barriers on lakes and rivers.</p>
        <p>The program has proved popular despite roiling old habits, with tens of thousands of volunteers and students wading into the dumps and even discreetly informing on neighbors still using straight pipes and indulging in ''holler tipping.'' Breathitt County provided a measure of the excitement with a $5 bounty for each appliance reclaimed from a dump or creek. In three days, residents had amassed a mountain of more than 5,000 rusted hulks for recycling, and the county had to float a loan to keep it growing.</p>
        <p>''For years, this was all a point of shame,'' Mr. Rogers said of the blight on his beloved eastern Kentucky, one of Appalachia's longer-suffering but gritty regions. ''To me, the most amazing thing is what Pride is doing to local politics: every candidate is suddenly running on platforms of cleaning up their county.''</p>
        <p>The political effects have resonated beyond the 40-county region. A new state law denies hookups for electricity to any new home that relies on straight-pipe sanitation. A central court, outside the region in Lexington, was designed to avoid having local juries judge and punish their sloppy neighbors. It has been ordering the worst polluters to pay $1,000 fines and haul out four tons of trash per violation as community service.</p>
        <p>''People dump everything down the hollers -- a wooden leg, dead house pets,'' Mr. Bickford said. ''We even caught a guy on one of our cameras shooting his dog.''</p>
        <p>With the new cleanup zeal, a special legislative session next winter will take up Gov. Paul E. Patton's omnibus sanitation proposal, which would provide for the first mandatory statewide garbage pickup in Kentucky, an old coal-and-timber state not previously rated as strong on environmentalism. Twenty-three of the state's 120 counties have made garbage collection mandatory in recent years, 18 of them in the Pride region.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers says the volunteers and the students avidly testing water quality and hauling trash provide the ultimate riposte to the old offensive cliches about Appalachian folk -- notions that, visitors easily see, do not apply in the face of the high-tech ''Silicon Holler'' budding near Hazard. ''The old stereotype of the mountain people was a creation of time and the press,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''But now I defy any other region to match what our people are doing to make their place better.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bickford, a retired Army general who ran the global fuel supply lines for the military services, returned home to Harlan County after 30 years of world travel and was appalled by how pervasively the ''throwaway society'' had marred the glory of Appalachia.</p>
        <p>''I tell people we still got the natural beauty, but why aren't the tourists here?'' he asks. ''I remind them our trash is not unique and tourists aren't going to pay to come and view it.''</p>
        <p>In Whitley County, Steve Schwartz packs a pistol and roams in a truck that proclaims ''environmental officer,'' as watchful as an old revenue agent. He writes trash citations that can bring fines of $500.</p>
        <p>''People were disturbed by all this at first, but they gradually began reporting neighbors when they saw things improving,'' said Mr. Schwartz, as he confronted a man named Lester about a straight pipe leading to a drainage ditch from his rundown trailer.</p>
        <p>Closely watching Lester and the Law was Judy Brimm, the local Pride volunteer. ''In the past, the straight-pipe problem simply wasn't discussed by anyone,'' she said. ''But the more I roamed around, the more irritated I got at what I saw. We tracked 63 dumps in the county and have cleaned up 38. But I found another 12.''</p>
        <p>She is grateful for the peer pressure that has sprung up over the dumps and straight pipes.</p>
        <p>''Mountain people are very proud,'' Mr. Bickford said. ''We may still have a lot of Bubbas and Billy Bobs here, but I've seen a lot of Bubbas and Billy Bobs in New York City, too. All very good people, once they see a problem and get after it.''</p>
