        <p>IN the years Joe DiMaggio reigned as New York's best baseball player, if not as all of baseball's best player, some often wondered how many more home runs he would have hit if he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in cozy Ebbets Field instead of in Yankee Stadium, even more cavernous then than now. When that question was being debated one day, a New York Journal-American baseball writer named Garry Schumacher shook his head.</p>

        <p>IN the years Joe DiMaggio reigned as New York's best baseball player, if not as all of baseball's best player, some often wondered how many more home runs he would have hit if he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in cozy Ebbets Field instead of in Yankee Stadium, even more cavernous then than now. When that question was being debated one day, a New York Journal-American baseball writer named Garry Schumacher shook his head.</p>
        <p>''DiMaggio could never play in Brooklyn,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Why not?'' one of Schumacher's listeners asked.</p>
        <p>''Because he's too perfect,'' Schumacher replied.</p>
        <p>Too perfect. Too elegant. Too stylish. At least for the borough that in those years embraced its Dodgers as ''dem bums'' long before the Boys of Summer team departed for Los Angeles after the 1957 season. But too perfect or not, Joe DiMaggio, in a way, is now playing in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Forty items of DiMaggio's memorabilia -- one of his Yankee uniform shirts, an oil portrait, his Hall of Fame induction plaque, autographed photos, bats and baseballs -- are on display at Xaverian High School in Bay Ridge.</p>
        <p>Some items will be auctioned at the Joe DiMaggio Award Dinner on Jan. 24 at the Marriott Marquis in Manhattan, with the proceeds going to the DiMaggio Scholarship Fund at Xaverian; other items will remain at the school.</p>
        <p>''Aside from the West Side Highway being changed to the Joe DiMaggio Highway shortly after his death early last year,'' said Sal Ferrera, the Xaverian president, ''our memorabilia is the only official connection to Joe DiMaggio in the New York area.''</p>
        <p>But why Brooklyn? Why Xaverian High School?</p>
        <p>''Joe's weakness was health and education,'' said Morris Engelberg, the lawyer for the DiMaggio estate, was saying from his Hollywood, Fla., office. ''Marilyn Monroe was his love, but children were his weakness. In 1997 Joe's foot doctor, Rock Positano, a Xaverian alumnus, brought him to the school to meet the championship baseball team the night before the school honored Joe with its first Concordia Award.''</p>
        <p>Of Xaverian's 1,300 boys, about 800 are involved in athletics.</p>
        <p>''I just thought Xaverian was where some of Joe's memorabilia belonged,'' Engelberg said. ''Everything there was in my office, personally signed by Joe. The 1951 Yankee uniform shirt is unusual because it's signed on the back. Joe seldom did that.</p>
        <p>''He once told me, 'I don't sign uniforms on the back because I never liked to have my picture taken from the back.' But he signed that shirt on the back.</p>
        <p>''Joe knew that about 60 percent of the boys at Xaverian are of Italian heritage,'' Engelberg added. ''Joe liked that. He would have wanted to have his memorabilia there.''</p>
        <p>Engelberg and Positano grew up in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn, where Yankee fans were few and far between. But DiMaggio was an Italian icon.</p>
        <p>''All my friends were Italian,'' Engelberg said. ''I remember their fathers let them root for the Dodgers but one said, 'When DiMaggio is up, you root for him.' ''</p>
        <p>Even so, it has to be wondered how many in Brooklyn were rooting for him with two out in the ninth inning of the fourth game of the 1941 World Series at Ebbets Field, when Mickey Owen let the right-hander Hugh Casey's third strike get past him and Tommy Henrich hurried to first base. If the Dodgers held onto their 4-3 lead, they would square the Series at 2-2.</p>
        <p>But the next batter, DiMaggio, singled sharply to left. Charlie Keller's two-run double put the Yankees ahead, 5-4. Joe Gordon's two-run double completed the Yankees' 7-4 victory.</p>
        <p>And somewhere in Brooklyn, so the story goes, a deflated Dodger fan tossed his dog out an open window in his upstairs apartment. The next day, the Yankees finished up the Series.</p>
        <p>In the 1947 Series against the Dodgers, DiMaggio thought he had hit a home run in the sixth game until little Al Gionfriddo raced to the 415-foot sign in front of the left-field bullpen in Yankee Stadium and caught the ball.</p>
        <p>In an unusual display of frustration, DiMaggio kicked the dirt near second base.</p>
        <p>The Yankees also won that Series, in seven games, then won the 1949 Series with the Dodgers in five games. In those three World Series against the Dodgers, Joe DiMaggio hit three homers and drove in eight runs, but batted only .263, .231 and .111.</p>
        <p>Enough to help the Yankees win, and enough to remain too perfect.</p>
