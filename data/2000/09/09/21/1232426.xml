        <p>While California suffers the most economic harm from earthquakes, cities in other parts of the country, like Seattle, New York, Salt Lake City and St. Louis, are also at risk of heavy damage and should be doing more to prevent such harm, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The agency conducted the study, its first nationwide projection of earthquake losses in monetary terms, to guide disaster planners and to show that earthquakes can be as economically devastating as hurricanes and flooding.</p>
        <p>Researchers reviewed when and how often quakes occur, and the value and condition of buildings in 1994, the latest comprehensive data available. Then they projected the number and strength of earthquakes over hundreds of years -- long enough to account for rare, powerful tremors in places like the East Coast.</p>
        <p>Based on those computer models, they calculated that earthquakes would cause an average of $4.4 billion in damage and lost income a year in the United States, comparable to the losses from hurricanes.</p>
        <p>While acknowledging that the condition and value of buildings is likely to change greatly, the study's authors said it would give disaster planners a baseline for understanding how much economic risk their communities face.</p>
        <p>Magnitude 7 earthquakes, for example, hit Charleston, S.C., in 1886, and off the Atlantic coast of Canada in 1929. A quake that size hitting an East Coast city today would probably cause tens of billions of dollars in damage, much more than if it hit a better-prepared West Coast city.</p>
        <p>The agency plans similar studies in the next two to three years to predict hurricane and flood damage. When those studies are released, local officials will be better able to prepare, said Dr. Stuart Nishenko, senior seismologist at the agency who was the study's project officer.</p>
        <p>Because of its large population in quake-prone regions, the West Coast sustains the biggest losses, the study said, with California absorbing almost three-quarters of the damage.</p>
        <p>The agency's model does not predict losses in any given year but provides a comparison of damage to various cities over centuries. In the projection, Los Angeles suffers the highest loss of any metropolitan area, an average of $1 billion a year.</p>
        <p>But the damage to the New York City area, averaged over the next 2,500 years, would be only 5 percent of that confronting Los Angeles. Even so, that is the most of any metropolitan area outside of the West Coast, and 11th over all.</p>
        <p>The estimates include only damage to buildings, not bridges, roads or other infrastructure.</p>
        <p>In the New York City area, most years there are no earthquakes. But three moderate temblors, about magnitude 5, have struck nearby in the last 300 years, and a quake that size today would probably cause several billion dollars of damage.</p>
        <p>Dr. Klaus Jacob, a senior research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University and an executive committee member of the New York City Consortium for Earthquake Loss Mitigation, estimated that a magnitude 5 earthquake could cause about $5 billion of damage.</p>
        <p>''When it gets to a magnitude 6, that's when it gets nasty,'' he said. A quake that size, he said, would cause about $30 billion of damage.</p>
        <p>In 1995, the city amended its building code to include seismic requirements for new buildings and older buildings undergoing major renovation. Since 1993, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has included seismic retrofits in major renovation work on its bridges.</p>
