        <p>New series of bold and provocative pulp fiction paperbacks is geared directly and unashamedly to black urban youths, serving as the literary equivalent of hip-hop videos and using the language, metaphor and rhythms of hip-hop, with all its sex and violence; books, published by ï¿½S}Affilates, an imprint of Syndicate Media Group, come packaged with a Def Jam CD, are being sold not in bookstores, but rather in record stores and gear and clothing shops where young urban blacks shop; they also include six or seven one-page color ads; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Life is good for Jerome Usher, who drinks Dom P and lives in an enormous apartment with three bedrooms and a walk-in closet with rows of Versace, Armani, Valentino and Gucci suits, a $15,000 billiard table, an 80-inch Mission armoire and 10 universal remotes with which he can flip on Mobb Deep's ''Hell on Earth'' or just about anything else. Jerome also has a collection of watches, from Cartiers to Patek Philippes, and a six-foot Mosler safe that holds an assortment of handguns and silencers and an AR-15 sniper rifle. They are his professional tools. Usher is a black hit man.</p>
        <p>He is the main character in the first of a series of bold and provocative pulp fiction paperbacks to be produced by a small publishing house that has popped up on the West Coast. The novels are geared directly and unashamedly to black urban youths and are meant to be more than just reads. They are the literary equivalent of hip-hop videos, using the language and metaphor and rhythms of hip-hop, its sex and violence, only in prose rather than lyrics and beats. Indeed, each novel comes packaged with a Def Jam CD, with tracks by artists like Jay-Z, Foxy Brown, Memphis Bleek, who have more or less donated their work. As the publisher's sampler proclaims, ''They aren't just books -- they're 'joints.' ''</p>
        <p>Now, one can argue that the last thing the world needs is a series of novels for young people that glorify sex and mayhem. Or one can argue that getting young people to read, whatever they read, is an important end in itself. Whatever the argument, and whatever one wants to make of these novels, the idea behind the enterprise is being examined with both fascination and wariness by some traditional publishers because there are plenty of other interesting impudences about these books besides their content.</p>
        <p>For instance, the books will be sold first not in bookstores, but in record stores and gear and clothing shops where young urban blacks shop. And each book will contain six or seven one-page color advertisements. Included in the first novel is an advertisement for Saucony sneakers and one for L.L. Cool J, as well as one for ''The Art of War,'' the latest movie featuring Wesley Snipes  (who is an investor in the publishing company). Not since the early days of paperbacks have books carried advertisements in them. Despite the book's violence, about 1,000 copies have been shipped, so far, to prisoners.</p>
        <p>Each novel will be about 6 by 6 inches, slightly larger than its accompanying CD; each will have a shimmery cover with a parental warning. Each will be about 150 to 160 pages and sell for $16.98, book and CD.</p>
        <p>The first of the novels will be in stores next month. It is ''Street Sweeper'' by Ronin Ro, the author of ''Have Gun Will Travel: The Spectacular Rise and Violent Fall of Death Row Records'' (Doubleday, 1998). There are 50,000 copies of ''Street Sweeper'' ready for distribution, the publisher said. The second book, in January, will be ''The International/Assignment Hong Kong'' by Antoine Black. The authors receive modest advances, ranging from $5,000 to $10,000.</p>
        <p>How does one describe Jerome Usher, the protagonist in the first novel? One part Richard Gere in ''American Gigolo,'' one part Sean Connery as James Bond and one part an emotionless Wesley Snipes in ''The Art of War.'' Toss in a touch of ''Goodfellas.'' Then make him bad and black, put a roll of $100 bills in his pocket and provide a different woman nearly every night. Wow, what kid wouldn't want to be Jerome? Still, Jerome becomes somewhat ennobled in the end, showing an unanticipated moral resolve when he falls in love, leading to a violent denouement, a recognizable scenario if you watch enough music videos. The ending is just unclear enough that if the book is a commercial success perhaps the hit man will be back.</p>
        <p>The books are being published by [S] Affiliated, an imprint of Syndicate Media Group, a small company in Los Angeles whose president, Marc Gerald, is one of two whites involved in the business. His previous experience in book publishing was as the editor, from 1996 to 1999, of the Old School Books imprint at W. W. Norton, which specialized in African-American suspense novels but not hip-hop.</p>
        <p>The arguments, of course, will center on whether reading this stuff will encourage violence. Which is much the same debate that surrounds rap music.</p>
        <p>''Our only goal is to sell books to a readership that just hasn't had books,'' Mr. Gerald said. ''They are not about the urban realism people expect. They're about style and suspense and no more violent than a Don Westlake or an Elmore Leonard novel.'' He argues that anything that gets young people reading is probably positive, almost regardless of its cultural virtue.</p>
        <p>He added: ''It's not our burden to be responsible. Our burden is to make people read, even if the books tread on dangerous ground. Nobody asks white kids to read responsible books. People need a first book to make them read more.'' Self-serving? Of course. Mr. Gerald is a businessman, and just about anything that will sell between covers, he'll consider publishing.</p>
        <p>But next year, to sort of balance things, Syndicate Media Group plans to offer several series of nonfiction books, also aimed at black urban youths. These books will be about self-help, finances, about relationships, sexuality, mental health and faith and spirituality. ''We'll tell young black men what Wall Street doesn't want people to know about investing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That's perhaps for the future. For now there are the novels, and for the black mother these books are not necessarily a positive. One African-American professional called them ''the literary equivalent of a sugary soft drink.'' She said: ''They're diversions that I don't think add anything to the understanding kids need of the world or themselves. Kids need to learn good contemporary writing and the classics. Pandering or dumbing down books for poor black kids is offensive.''</p>
        <p>Anita Diggs, an African-American who heads the One World imprint at Ballantine Books, said the whole enterprise ''doesn't sound like anything new.''</p>
        <p>''I used to read Donald Goines and Iceberg Slim under the covers when I was a teenager,'' she said. ''I don't think that's what I should have been reading. This is the same wine in new bottles. Would I want my daughter to read them? No, I want kids to read substantial fare, enriching books.''</p>
        <p>Certainly traditional publishing floods the world with books for children and teenagers. How many of are aimed at young black readers? That's for another column.</p>
