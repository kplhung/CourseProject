        <p>Few slow-play penalties were imposed at the world team championship in Maastricht, the Netherlands, this month. When play was slow, there were several possible reasons: a particularly close match, complex conventions requiring much study of defensive methods, naturally slow players and difficult hands. South was certainly entitled to take his time in playing the diagramed deal from the quarterfinal stage.</p>
        <p>When the Austrian East-West pair came to rest in two hearts, the American South, Howard Weinstein, reopened with a double. East eventually doubled three clubs, which should have failed by one trick.</p>

        <p>Few slow-play penalties were imposed at the world team championship in Maastricht, the Netherlands, this month. When play was slow, there were several possible reasons: a particularly close match, complex conventions requiring much study of defensive methods, naturally slow players and difficult hands. South was certainly entitled to take his time in playing the diagramed deal from the quarterfinal stage.</p>
        <p>When the Austrian East-West pair came to rest in two hearts, the American South, Howard Weinstein, reopened with a double. East eventually doubled three clubs, which should have failed by one trick.</p>
        <p>After the defense took the heart ace, the spade ace and the spade king, East should have given his partner a spade ruff. He erred, however, by leading the heart queen and the play became complicated. South ruffed, crossed to the diamond king and led a trump. East put up the queen, and South won with the ace, leaving this position:</p>
        <p>The obvious lead of the club jack at this point would fail if East ducked. South could then cross to the diamond ace and lead a trump but would lose a trump trick when East took his king and led a spade.</p>
        <p>After careful card-reading, Weinstein led to the diamond ace immediately and then played a trump. East had to play low, and the jack won. Now South ruffed a diamond winner, ruffed a heart, and crossed to the spade queen. Then his last trump scored en passant to bring home his doubled contract. The Americans gained 13 after scoring 140 in the replay.</p>
