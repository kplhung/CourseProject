        <p>After a humbling loss Tuesday night, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine scolded his players for their lackluster play this month. Today, he put the responsibility on himself, suggesting for the second year in a row that he should not return as manager if the Mets somehow miss the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''If we don't make the playoffs, I'll gladly take Fred off the hook, if we have to get into that nonsense again,'' Valentine said, referring to the Mets' co-owner, Fred Wilpon.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, when pressed by reporters, Valentine backed off that statement. ''I got to retract that silly thing I said here,'' he said. ''I cut to the chase and jumped to a conclusion that someone was going to ask it.''</p>
        <p>Late last September, as the Mets suddenly crumbled and their comfortable four-game wild-card lead vanished, Valentine stated that he should be fired if the Mets did not reach the postseason. Wilpon backed Valentine then, although he did not extend Valentine's contract, which expires after this season. The Mets recovered and reached the National League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>Wilpon has maintained he will make no decisions on Valentine's future until after this season, though he said on Aug. 31 that he shared Valentine's ''good feeling'' that he would return next year. The Mets led the National League East that day, but their 6-12 record this month has dropped them four games behind the Atlanta Braves after tonight's 6-3 victory, and, for the third straight season, raised questions about why the Mets stumble so severely in September with so much at stake.</p>
        <p>After tonight's game against Atlanta, the Mets held a five and one-game lead for the wild-card spot and Wilpon said today that he still believed in Valentine.</p>
        <p>''We have to focus on the games, and right now, we're in a slump, no question,'' Wilpon said. ''But I have a lot of confidence in Steve and Bobby and in all of our coaches and players, and I think they're going to turn it around. We'll look back on it as a slump, and therefore we'll get to where we want to get to. I'm very optimistic.''</p>
        <p>Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, who is also in the last year of his contract, was not in Atlanta tonight, but through a team spokesman he declined comment on Valentine's remarks. But Wilpon said, ''Steve has indicated he'd like Bobby to return as manager.''</p>
        <p>Valentine said Phillips conveyed that wish to him in a telephone conversation this morning.</p>
        <p>Today's pregame interview was conducted in the manager's office in the visiting clubhouse, where Valentine had been combative and tense during Tuesday's postgame session, after the Braves had routed the Mets. It was the 11th straight time  that they have lost a September or October game at Turner Field. He was relaxed today, though sarcastic, when his future was mentioned.</p>
        <p>''Oh yeah, I'd rather have it about me, absolutely, please do,'' he said. ''It's just, again and again, it's the same old thing. If the team's going good, I know who it's about, and when they're not going good, I know who it's about. It's not going good, so let's make it about me.''</p>
        <p>Valentine then asked repeatedly for the other side of the argument, for what would happen if the Mets make the playoffs. ''What is the flip side?'' he said. ''Play it for me, so I can hear the music.''</p>
