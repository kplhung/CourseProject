        <p>A federal judge today dismissed the wrongful death civil lawsuit brought by Branch Davidians, clearing the government of any wrongdoing in the deaths of about 80 members of the religious sect during the disastrous 1993 standoff at the group's compound near Waco, Tex.</p>
        <p>The judge, Walter Smith Jr. of Federal District Court in Waco, issued an order that found that federal agents had acted legally and could not be held liable for the deaths. His ruling ended a legal battle that lasted nearly seven years and came after an advisory jury in the case and a special counsel, former Senator John C.

        <p>A federal judge today dismissed the wrongful death civil lawsuit brought by Branch Davidians, clearing the government of any wrongdoing in the deaths of about 80 members of the religious sect during the disastrous 1993 standoff at the group's compound near Waco, Tex.</p>
        <p>The judge, Walter Smith Jr. of Federal District Court in Waco, issued an order that found that federal agents had acted legally and could not be held liable for the deaths. His ruling ended a legal battle that lasted nearly seven years and came after an advisory jury in the case and a special counsel, former Senator John C. Danforth, both issued similar findings in July.</p>
        <p>The Associated Press reported that Judge Smith wrote in his order that no Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents ''fired any shot nor used any force against residents of the compound and the Davidians that was unprovoked.''</p>
        <p>''Gunfire was directed at A.T.F. agents by both male and female adult Davidians,'' the judge wrote. ''No A.T.F. agent fired any shot nor used any force against residents of the compound and the Davidians that was indiscriminate.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder issued a statement: ''We are pleased with today's ruling. Like the special counsel before it, the court reaffirmed the fact that David Koresh and certain Branch Davidians were responsible for the tragedy at Waco.''</p>
        <p>The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louis J. Freeh, whose agents were accused of causing the deaths of the Branch Davidians, called the ruling gratifying.</p>
        <p>''All the agents in both agencies have for seven long years carried the heavy personal burden those unfounded allegations placed upon them,'' Mr. Freeh said in a statement. ''For them and their families, I am grateful the court and the judge laid the blame squarely on the Davidians.''</p>
        <p>Michael Caddell, the lead lawyer for the survivors and relatives of the Branch Davidians, could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>In July, the government won two definitive victories.</p>
        <p>First, a jury serving as an advisory panel to Judge Smith deliberated for less than two hours before finding that federal agents did not use excessive force on Feb. 28, 1993, when A.T.F. agents attempted to arrest Branch Davidian leader David Koresh on weapons charges.</p>
        <p>The ensuing gun battle left four  agents and six Davidians dead and began a 51-day standoff.</p>
        <p>The standoff ended on April 19, 1993, when F.B.I. agents used armored vehicles to pump tear gas into the compound hours before the wooden structure burned to the ground. The advisory jury also cleared the bureau of any wrongdoing on that final day.</p>
        <p>Second, a week after the jury's verdict, Mr. Danforth, the special counsel appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to re-examine the incident, announced a sweeping report that also exonerated the government.</p>
