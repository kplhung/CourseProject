        <p>A man who was installing an M.R.I. machine at New York-Presbyterian Hospital was killed yesterday, apparently after nitrogen he was using leaked from its tank, officials said. Six other people were injured in the incident.</p>
        <p>The worker, Paul Ambrose, 25, of England, died about 11:25 a.m., apparently from asphyxiation, while working in a poorly ventilated trailer  alongside the hospital on 70th Street and York Avenue, said Mayor Rudolph W.

        <p>A man who was installing an M.R.I. machine at New York-Presbyterian Hospital was killed yesterday, apparently after nitrogen he was using leaked from its tank, officials said. Six other people were injured in the incident.</p>
        <p>The worker, Paul Ambrose, 25, of England, died about 11:25 a.m., apparently from asphyxiation, while working in a poorly ventilated trailer  alongside the hospital on 70th Street and York Avenue, said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who arrived at the hospital shortly after the incident occurred.</p>
        <p>Two other workers, after learning that Mr. Ambrose had not left the trailer, went back inside and found him unconscious, the authorities said. The two workers and four other people in the vicinity complained of varying degrees of lightheadedness. They were treated at the hospital and released.</p>
        <p>While the authorities are still investigating the cause of the accident, they strongly suspect that one of the liquid nitrogen tanks that was used while installing an M.R.I. had leaked, Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>''We checked very quickly and there doesn't seem to be any other reported incidents like this,'' he said. ''I think it's going to be a while before we can give you an answer to why it happened.''</p>
        <p>Hospital officials said no patients were in danger because the leak was not in the main building, and the liquid nitrogen tanks have since been been removed.</p>
        <p>Richard Sheirer, the city's director of emergency management, said that nitrogen is used during the installation to cool magnets in the M.R.I. unit, and the tanks are removed after installation is complete. An M.R.I., which stands for magnetic resonance imaging, is a diagnostic tool for doctors.</p>
        <p>''Liquid nitrogen is not deadly in and of itself, but when it's turned into a gas will displace oxygen,'' Mr. Sheirer said. ''So in a closed space, it takes out the oxygen in the air.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ambrose was a subcontractor for GE Medical Systems, the Wisconsin medical technology company hired to install the M.R.I.</p>
        <p>''This is extremely unusual and it's never happened with us before,'' said Charles Young, a spokesman for GE Medical Systems. ''We are doing the best we can to try to find out what could have happened.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Young said that over the last 15 years, the company had installed more than 7,500 M.R.I. systems in hospitals around the world, and had never had a problem with the nitrogen tanks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Young said the workers who had been installing the M.R.I. were trained and had installed the machines in other local hospitals.</p>
        <p>The installation usually takes about four weeks and the workers were just a few days into it, he said.</p>
