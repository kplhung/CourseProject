        <p>As a professional interior designer for 40 years, I was both appalled and appreciative of ''The Secret World of Decorators: A 'Good Eye,' Charging by the Glance'' (Aug. 17). Appalled at the inevitable distrust your readers must feel about our profession as practiced by certain ''designers'' and appreciative because you set forth the acute need for standards and regulations in this field. Ours is the only profession that does not require a license to practice, based on education, training and experience.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a professional interior designer for 40 years, I was both appalled and appreciative of ''The Secret World of Decorators: A 'Good Eye,' Charging by the Glance'' (Aug. 17). Appalled at the inevitable distrust your readers must feel about our profession as practiced by certain ''designers'' and appreciative because you set forth the acute need for standards and regulations in this field. Ours is the only profession that does not require a license to practice, based on education, training and experience.</p>
        <p>At my graduation from the Parsons School of Design in 1948, our graduation speaker was Billy Baldwin, a leader in what was then a highly respected profession, who warned us that we could not consider ourselves truly competent designers worthy of the title until we had at least 10 years of experience. Today, anyone can call himself or herself an interior designer by acquiring a resale number, an entitlement to trade discounts, no questions asked.</p>
        <p>The National Society of Interior Designers has an obligation in this situation, rife with abuses on the part of both the decorator and the public, to undertake a major public education setting forth criteria and standards to meet licensing requirements before anyone can legally acquire the title of interior designer.</p>
        <p>If the national society does not, the public should demand protection from the widespread and blatant deception and malpractice so common today.</p>
