        <p>Two major accounting firms broke rank with other firms yesterday and offered a compromise proposal to impose significant restrictions on the consulting work that accountants can do for their audit clients.</p>
        <p>The proposal, by Ernst &amp; Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers, does not go nearly as far as one that the Securities and Exchange Commission had put forth, but it would represent a victory for Arthur Levitt, the S.E.C. chairman, who seems determined to enact new rules this year.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Two major accounting firms broke rank with other firms yesterday and offered a compromise proposal to impose significant restrictions on the consulting work that accountants can do for their audit clients.</p>
        <p>The proposal, by Ernst &amp; Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers, does not go nearly as far as one that the Securities and Exchange Commission had put forth, but it would represent a victory for Arthur Levitt, the S.E.C. chairman, who seems determined to enact new rules this year.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview last night, Mr. Levitt said the new proposal ''represents a very constructive approach that the commission will seriously consider.''</p>
        <p>Speaking at an S.E.C. hearing, James J. Schiro, the chief executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the new proposal ''would meet the commission's objectives'' while allowing auditing firms to ''provide the services we anticipate our clients will require in the 21st century.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Schiro said he had been ''extremely encouraged'' by the willingness of the S.E.C. staff to talk and entertain the possibility of compromises. Mr. Levitt praised the two firms for working with the commission staff and said he hoped that other firms would be willing to join in the talks.</p>
        <p>Philip Laskaway, the chairman of Ernst &amp; Young, said the proposal would ''address most of the issues of concern'' to the commission while assuring that auditors could do a good job.</p>
        <p>The compromise proposal would bar auditors from performing some -- but not all -- internal auditing functions for companies that they audit. It would also restrict how much work audit firms could do in developing management information systems for audit clients. In general, they could not develop systems that were important in compiling a company's financial reports. The S.E.C. is concerned that auditors not be in a position of auditing work done by their colleagues, fearing that the auditors would be reluctant to criticize such systems.</p>
        <p>The two firms had supported the S.E.C.'s initiative but had criticized some parts of it. Others in the accounting industry had hoped that PricewaterhouseCoopers, in particular, would oppose the S.E.C. position.</p>
        <p>James Copeland, chief executive of Deloitte &amp; Touche and a strong critic of the S.E.C. action, testified against the original proposal yesterday, saying it would reduce the quality of audits by limiting the knowledge and expertise of auditors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Copeland said he would study the new proposal but added that any proposal ''that makes it more difficult for us to access and maintain technology expertise in the age of technology can't be a good idea.''</p>
