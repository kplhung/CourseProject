        <p>If all goes as planned in a complex series of mergers in the last quarter of this year, Craig O. McCaw will control just over 60 percent of the stock of the new satellite company to be created from the merger of the formerly bankrupt ICO Global Communications and Mr. McCaw's Teledesic, according to documents filed yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. McCaw will have to raise at least $2.8 billion in new investments for the London-based company to begin offering voice and data services for mobile phone and computer users in mid-2003, the filing said.</p>
