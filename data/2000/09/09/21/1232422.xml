        <p>William J. Bennett, who has often joined forces with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in assailing violence and vulgarity in popular culture, sharply attacked Mr. Lieberman today, accusing him of retreating from that cause.</p>

        <p>William J. Bennett, who has often joined forces with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in assailing violence and vulgarity in popular culture, sharply attacked Mr. Lieberman today, accusing him of retreating from that cause.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, denied the accusation, arguing that he and Vice President Al Gore had, in fact, been tougher on the entertainment industry than their Republican opponents, and suggested that Mr. Bennett's remarks were motivated by his support for Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>The exchange between two men who called each other friends stemmed largely from a fund-raiser on Monday night in Beverly Hills, Calif., attended by Mr. Gore, Mr. Lieberman and several entertainment executives and stars. At that event, Mr. Lieberman muted his criticism of the industry, a week after he and Mr. Gore proposed new regulation of its marketing of violent and sexual material to children.</p>
        <p>''Al and I have tremendous regard for this industry,'' Mr. Lieberman said Monday night. ''It's true from time to time we will have been, will be critics, or noodges, but I promise you this: We will never never put the government in the position of telling you by law, through law, what to make. We will nudge you, but we will never become censors.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Bennett, the conservative moralist who was secretary of education under President Ronald Reagan and drug policy director for President George Bush, released a statement saying: ''I am deeply disappointed by Senator Lieberman's recent comments to members of the entertainment industry. Senator Lieberman so softly voiced his criticisms about the products of that industry that they were barely audible.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennett said, ''I did not realize that when Joe Lieberman and I were denouncing the filth, sewage, and mindless bloodletting of the popular entertainment industry, calling it what it is -- degrading and dehumanizing -- we were just being 'noodges.' ''</p>
        <p>Saying he was ''disappointed'' by Mr. Bennett's comments, Mr. Lieberman said, ''I wonder whether this is a sign of a campaign that's faltering or kind of anxiously trying to figure out how to regain the momentum.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Bennett, Jeff Kwitkowski, said there was nothing partisan about the criticism, insisting, ''We're not playing sides here.''</p>
        <p>Last week, the Federal Trade Commission reported that the entertainment industry routinely marketed adult material to children. Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman proposed that if the industry did not change its practices within six months, the commission should impose regulations on the marketing of movies, video games and music, and that a new law to that effect should be passed, if needed.</p>
        <p>''The fact is that Al Gore and I, after the F.T.C. report, made the toughest statement,'' Mr. Lieberman said today. ''Where was the Bush-Cheney ticket on the F.T.C. report? They expressed concern, but there was no teeth to anything they said.''</p>
        <p>Republicans contend that Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman have been hypocritical over the issue, criticizing the industry while raising millions of dollars from it.</p>
        <p>Today, for the first time, Mr. Lieberman replied directly to that accusation.</p>
        <p>''Part of leadership,'' Senator Lieberman said, is ''to be willing to stand up to your friends and supporters and say, 'we think you're wrong on this.'</p>
        <p>''I'm looking forward to the day when I see George Bush and Dick Cheney stand up to their friends in the oil industry,'' he added, ''their supporters in the oil industry, and tell them they think they can do better than they are now for American consumers and the American economy, or to stand up to the tobacco industry or the N.R.A.''</p>
        <p>Though he softened his remarks on Monday night, Mr. Lieberman has been a steadfast critic of some elements of the entertainment industry. In testimony last Wednesday before the Senate Commerce Committee, he warned of ''the culture of carnage surrounding our children,'' who, he said, had been focused on by the entertainment media with ''a toxic mix turning some of them into killers.''</p>
        <p>But he has also stressed that while he hoped to cajole and embarrass the industry into changing what it produced, he did not advocate government regulation of content, but only of marketing practices, a point he also made before this campaign.</p>
        <p>In his statement, Mr. Bennett said, ''I'm saddened that my friend Joe Lieberman's powerful, direct criticisms became sotto voce when he was among many of those whose work he had previously criticized.''</p>
