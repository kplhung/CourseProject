        <p>The chairman of a state board overseeing Nassau County's efforts to solve its fiscal crisis issued a stern warning to county officials today: drop the partisan political games or face a state takeover.</p>
        <p>In his first public comments since receiving County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta's four-year fiscal rescue plan last week, Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, reminded county officials that the authority was prepared to take control of the county's day-to-day fiscal operations, a step that all sides hope to avoid.</p>
        <p>''You all know the political process, under normal circumstances, is full of games,'' Mr. Zarb said at a meeting of the board. For instance, he said, no one may want to be the first to propose a tax increase. ''But we don't have time for political games in this process,'' he said. ''This is a crisis, and people are either going to have to speak up or not, and then we'll have to do what we have to do.''</p>
        <p>As the state board began dissecting the budget plan submitted by Mr. Gulotta, Mr. Zarb said he expected county legislative leaders to identify all of the spending cuts or new revenues that it considers unrealistic. Mr. Zarb wants a list of the problems and proposed legislative solutions in time for the board to rule on Mr. Gulotta's plan at its next meeting, on Oct. 2.</p>
        <p>But the Democratic and Republican legislative leaders said that before they could pinpoint any problems, they would need much more detail from Mr. Gulotta, particularly about his $74.5 million in proposed budget cuts through 2004 and the tentative contract agreements he has reached with three county law enforcement unions.</p>
        <p>''We have our work cut out for us,'' said Judith A. Jacobs, the presiding officer of the Nassau County Legislature and the leader of its Democratic majority. ''But we need the cooperation of being given the proper documents to do a proper analysis. Otherwise, it is going to be impossible. We can't act on rumor and innuendo; we have to act on fact.''</p>
        <p>Peter J. Schmitt, the leader of the Republican minority, said that ''big chunks of the budget'' raised questions because Mr. Gulotta had not provided enough detail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta, a three-term Republican who is proposing layoffs of more than 350 workers and a series of property tax increases to bring the county back from the brink of bankruptcy, said in an interview that he would immediately provide the data the legislators need.</p>
        <p>''I'm prepared to work in order to come up with alternatives if there is some phase of the budget that has been submitted that doesn't stand up to muster or that is questionable,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But at a public meeting of the state oversight board in the morning and at a later closed meeting with Mr. Gulotta and the legislative leaders,  Mr. Zarb warned that the county was fast running out of time to remedy the county's estimated $143 million deficit next year and the more than $300 million cumulative shortfall in the following three years.</p>
        <p>In May, Gov. George E. Pataki offered a $100 million bailout of Nassau, one of the nation's wealthiest counties, if it could make more than $270 million in cuts over the next four years. Mr. Gulotta submitted his 2001 budget proposal and a multiyear plan on Friday, two minutes before the midnight deadline. The county must pass a budget by Oct. 30, but Mr. Zarb would like one sooner.</p>
        <p>''Should, for any reason, the system falter, and the county executive and the Legislature not complete this task as defined, then that assistance from the state is in jeopardy,'' he said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zarb said that he had expected  Mr. Gulotta to provide more details in his plan, specifically on spending cuts in the first years, 2001 and 2002.  But he would not say whether he would immediately reject any items in Mr. Gulotta's plan.</p>
        <p>In questions to Mr. Zarb, however, some board members identified several problems with Mr. Gulotta's plan. They asked, for example, how his proposed pay raises for the county police -- more than 20 percent for officers and detectives, and more than 30 percent for county correction officers -- would allow $20 million in savings that Mr. Gulotta expects from the department next year, even if concessions he has won from the police unions are taken into account.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs, the Democratic leader, told Mr. Zarb that she had the same concerns about the police contracts, and that her caucus and the members of her fiscal staff had not seen them yet. She also said Mr. Gulotta's plan to cease sharing $50 million in sales tax revenue with the county's towns and cities was ''wishful thinking,'' because it would require state authorization, which was unlikely.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs said she and her staff would examine whether Mr. Gulotta had proposed all the cuts possible. But, she said, it is looking more and more as if the county will have to ''raise our taxes'' above what Mr. Gulotta has proposed.</p>
        <p>She said that legislative committee hearings would begin on Monday, and that she planned to take the unusual step of making county department heads take an oath before testifying.</p>
        <p>''We all know they are working at the will of the county executive,'' Ms. Jacobs said. ''People might be inclined, you know, not to tell us the truth. In these crisis times, the truth is the only way to go here.''</p>
