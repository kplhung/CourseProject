        <p>FOR once, real estate experts are speechless.</p>
        <p>''I'm at a loss to characterize this market,'' Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate, said this week. ''It's kind of like a tornado, where one house is blown to smithereens and the next one remains intact. There might be two apartments that we thought were similar: one will sell immediately for more than the asking price, and the other one will sit on the market for four months. I can't explain it.''</p>

        <p>FOR once, real estate experts are speechless.</p>
        <p>''I'm at a loss to characterize this market,'' Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate, said this week. ''It's kind of like a tornado, where one house is blown to smithereens and the next one remains intact. There might be two apartments that we thought were similar: one will sell immediately for more than the asking price, and the other one will sit on the market for four months. I can't explain it.''</p>
        <p>Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a large appraisal company, is also mystified. In the last month, he said, ''the market has been inconsistent: one apartment sells instantly, and there's very little activity on another.''</p>
        <p>Over all, the experts stress that the current market is still strong -- it's just that the frenzy has disappeared. ''The overheatedness is gone,'' said Alan J. Rogers, chairman of Douglas Elliman, the city's largest residential real estate brokerage. ''The crazy bidding wars are gone.'' During the summer, he said, prices appear to have stabilized.</p>
        <p>This week, Clark Halstead, of the Halstead Property Company, said that there are now more properties on the market -- perhaps 10 percent more -- than there were last March, one of the hottest months for apartment buying in New York history. Some sellers are putting their co-ops on the market, he said, because ''in their wisdom, they've decided to get out while the getting is good.''</p>
        <p>He paused. ''And that means it's a great time to buy.''</p>
        <p>In addition, brokers report that while a lot of people are looking, some are choosing to wait longer before signing a contract. Others are deciding to rent -- though the rental market may be at a peak -- until prices fall, said Deborah B. Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York.</p>
        <p>''Many of my clients are telling me they're afraid to buy at the top of the market,'' said Mark E. Zimmerman, a real estate lawyer at a Midtown firm.</p>
        <p>It wasn't always so. ''In March, people were agreeing to terms that I, as their attorney, was telling them not to agree to,'' Mr. Zimmerman said. That desperation is gone, he added. But there is still buyer's anxiety, or the fear that if a deal isn't made, the buyer won't be able to find something else.</p>
        <p>These are the days of mixed signals: people don't want to pay the peak price, but they don't want to lose out, either.</p>
        <p>Experts advise apartment hunters to use the new breathing room to research a purchase thoroughly, resulting in less buyer remorse, or the feeling of being pressured into either buying the wrong apartment or paying too much for the right one. Last spring, second thoughts ended in a string of broken deals.</p>
        <p>Buyers worried that the market may fall after they move in can protect themselves by buying an apartment with an unusual, sought-after feature, said Mr. Miller, the appraiser. ''Historically, apartments with unique features tend to be less volatile,'' he continued. ''Look for outdoor space, a view, a well-done renovation.''</p>
        <p>Other experts advise the opposite: to find a rare bargain, they say, look for an apartment that has a flaw. Overlooks an air shaft? Has no elevator? ''In this market, anything that is remotely perceived to have a flaw may sit on the market,'' Mr. Peters said. So make an offer.</p>
        <p>Just recently, a couple were worried about having just bought a walk-up downtown, said Stuart Saft, chairman of the New York Council of Co-operatives and Condominiums. He added, ''I told them they paid less because of it -- and if the market goes up, they'll make quite a profit.''</p>
        <p>Anyone who has fallen in love with an apartment but wonders if it is overpriced should pay close attention to similar apartments sold in the same building or nearby. Prices have soared until this spring, and  though this summer saw a tapering off of the hysteria, prices are still high. Thus, buyers should concentrate on the most recent sales, brokers said.</p>
        <p>The old rules still apply. Buyers should take time to sound out the building's financial health, Mr. Saft said. ''If the board has raised the maintenance 10 percent every year -- in these times of relatively low inflation -- you might ask why.''</p>
        <p>A buyer's accountant or lawyer can help evaluate the underlying mortgage. Is it disproportionately large, based on the number of units? What is the interest rate? When will the mortgage come due?</p>
        <p>Finally, bank on a good neighborhood, Mr. Saft said. ''If the market goes down,'' he noted, ''properties in a marginal neighborhood will suffer first.''</p>
