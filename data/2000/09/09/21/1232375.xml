        <p>Vice President Al Gore accused pharmaceutical companies today of gouging the elderly, pointing to the examples of several people he said were having problems paying for their medicine. But he did not repeat a personal anecdote about prescription drugs that Republicans have sharply ridiculed: the one about his mother-in-law, who, he said last month, paid three times as much for her arthritis medication as he did for the same drug for his dog.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has since said he based the anecdote on a Congressional study rather than on any actual bills paid by his mother-in-law, Margaret Ann Aitcheson, who lives with his family at the vice president's residence in Washington.</p>
        <p>Though Gov. George W. Bush's campaign has seized on news accounts casting doubt on the anecdote's accuracy, Mr. Gore's aides have insisted that the overall point -- that drug companies are gouging the elderly -- was valid.</p>
        <p>Republicans have kept the matter alive, saying the anecdote demonstrated that Mr. Gore makes up stories.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore's Republican rival, kept the heat on today, saying in an interview with Reuters that Mr. Gore had a tendency ''to make up facts to make his case.'' Mr. Bush added, ''The idea that he would make up facts about a family member confirms what I have said in the past, that he'll say anything to be the president.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, at a rally in a park here this morning, devoted much of his speech to the problems people on Medicare face.</p>
        <p>''Why should seniors be charged a much higher price than anybody else in America and anybody else in the world?'' he asked. ''Drug companies are running up record profits while seniors cannot afford the medicines that their doctors prescribe.''</p>
        <p>He then mentioned several people, including Florence Sykes of New Hampshire, Shirley Kendall of Connecticut and Jacqueline Johnson of Missouri, as burdened by the cost of prescription drugs. ''Now these are the people that I'm fighting for,'' he said. ''And these are the people that are your parents and your grandparents and, in some cases, you yourselves.''</p>
        <p>That was essentially the point he made last month at a town-hall meeting in Tallahassee, Fla., when he mentioned his mother-in-law.</p>
        <p>The Tampa Tribune gave this account of the meeting: ''After hearing from several retirees about having to choose which medications to buy, Gore suggested the pharmaceutical industry should lower prices. As an example, he offered the plight of his mother-in-law, who spends $108 a month for a drug called Lodine, which helps relieve the pain of arthritis. Gore said his 14-year-old black Labrador retriever, Shilo, also suffers from arthritis and he has a veterinarian's prescription for Lodine. The difference? It costs less than $39 a month to fill the dog's prescription for what Gore said is the exact same drug. 'Don't you think that ought to be changed?' he asked as the crowd applauded.''</p>
        <p>The Boston Globe reported on Monday that Mr. Gore's remarks were based on figures from a Congressional report, not on his family's actual drug bills, and the matter has nipped at Mr. Gore's heels all week.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the Gore campaign said the report that Mr. Gore had cited put the wholesale price of Lodine, the arthritis drug for humans, at $1.20 per capsule and Etogesic, the one for dogs, at 42 cents. The Lodine for Mrs. Aitcheson cost $2.13 per capsule, while Shiloh's Etogesic cost 92 cents per capsule, the campaign said. The campaign did not specify the dosage for humans or for dogs.</p>
        <p>A check by The New York Times of several pharmacies and veterinary clinics in Washington found a price disparity between Lodine and Etogesic capsules roughly similar to that given by Mr. Gore. But the capsules were different sizes. For Lodine, the cost ranged from $1.81 to $2.29 per 300-milligram capsule. For Etogesic, the prices were 80 cents to 96 cents per 150-milligram capsule. By the milligram, Lodine and Etogesic are much closer in price than Mr. Gore's anecdote suggests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, was inundated again today with questions about the vice president's mother-in-law. Asked why Mr. Gore had not mentioned her today as he cited personal stories, Mr. Lehane said: ''The issue is not about him, the issue is about the American people, and that's the point of this. The Bush campaign has spent two years trying to find an issue. Apparently they think dogs is their issue.''</p>
        <p>A reporter interrupted, saying, ''No, they think hyperbole is the issue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehane said: ''Well, we'll see. I think the American people are going to be a lot more concerned about who's offering them a real prescription drug benefit.''</p>
        <p>The campaign was eager to move on to other subjects. Mr. Gore said today in an interview with Fox News that on Thursday he would address the increase in the price of heating oil, no doubt affording him the opportunity to discuss Mr. Bush's ties to the oil industry. ''The profits of the big oil companies have skyrocketed just at the time when the American people have been paying these gigantic price increases,'' Mr. Gore told Fox. ''I'm going to be making a major policy speech tomorrow outlining a specific course of action.''</p>
