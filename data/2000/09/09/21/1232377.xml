        <p>Editorial urges Congress and transportation officials to promote Amtrak's high-speed rail service as means of alleviating air traffic congestion; notes that 18 of the 20 most congested airports nationwide are in cities on designated high-speed rail corriders (M)</p>

        <p>On days when gridlock paralyzed Newark International Airport this year, Continental Airlines resorted to putting some of its short-flight passengers on Amtrak trains. Such pragmatic improvisation made sense, but also raises the question why anyone would choose to fly from Newark to Baltimore or Providence in the first place. At a time when the nation's air traffic system is strained to its very limits, it is a question gaining added urgency.</p>
        <p>Congress could enhance Amtrak's ability to ease the burden on the nation's congested skies and highways by passing the High Speed Rail Investment Act before it adjourns next month. The bill would enable Amtrak to issue $10 billion in bonds over the next decade for capital expenditures in designated high-speed rail corridors. States would provide some matching funds and bondholders would be paid in tax credits, at a cost to taxpayers of $3.3 billion over 10 years.</p>

        <p>On days when gridlock paralyzed Newark International Airport this year, Continental Airlines resorted to putting some of its short-flight passengers on Amtrak trains.

At a time when the nation's air traffic system is strained to its very limits, it is a question gaining added urgency.</p>
        <p>Congress could enhance Amtrak's ability to ease the burden on the nation's congested skies and highways by passing the High Speed Rail Investment Act before it adjourns next month. The bill would enable Amtrak to issue $10 billion in bonds over the next decade for capital expenditures in designated high-speed rail corridors.

        <p>Though it had its best summer ever this year, and says it will attain operational self-sufficiency by 2003 as required by Congress, Amtrak is partly to blame for the continued skepticism facing rail travel. Its failure last fall to launch the Acela Express service between New York City and Boston on schedule deprived high-speed rail boosters of a working success to justify investment in other high-speed corridors. Amtrak did cut the trip down to four hours from five, but delayed the introduction of the sleek new trains that will travel at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. That service is now expected to begin within the next two months and should cut the trip down to three hours, the length at which downtown-to-downtown train service becomes preferable to negotiating congested airports, as evidenced by Amtrak's service to Washington. Amtrak commands twice as large a market share on that route as it does on the longer run to Boston.</p>
        <p>Eighteen of the 20 most congested airports nationwide are in cities on designated high-speed rail corridors. The time has come for Congress and transportation officials to promote high-speed rail service as a means of alleviating air traffic congestion.</p>
