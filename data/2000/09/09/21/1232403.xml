        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy signed a two-year contract with the Board of Education yesterday that allows him to quit at any time, technically a departure from previous practice. In another change, the contract allows the board to fire Mr. Levy without a long hearing process.</p>
        <p>The contract also provides Mr. Levy with a housing allowance of up to $120,000 a year, even though he owns his apartment on the Upper West Side. He asked for the stipend because previous chancellors had lived free in a board-owned town house in Brooklyn Heights.</p>

        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy signed a two-year contract with the Board of Education yesterday that allows him to quit at any time, technically a departure from previous practice. In another change, the contract allows the board to fire Mr. Levy without a long hearing process.</p>
        <p>The contract also provides Mr. Levy with a housing allowance of up to $120,000 a year, even though he owns his apartment on the Upper West Side. He asked for the stipend because previous chancellors had lived free in a board-owned town house in Brooklyn Heights.</p>
        <p>The board plans to rent out the town house and use the proceeds for the stipend. It will also reimburse Mr. Levy for any taxes he has to pay on the additional income. His annual salary will be $245,000 a year, an amount that was agreed on when he was appointed in May.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy's predecessor, Rudy Crew, was not allowed to terminate his contract at will, lawyers familiar with the agreement said. Instead, he could simply choose not to renew his contract after it expired.</p>
        <p>The contract states that if Mr. Levy quits, he would collect salary and benefits for at least another three months, if he gives three months' notice. If the board were to end the contract, it would owe Mr. Levy up to a year's salary.</p>
        <p>When the board voted last winter not to renew Dr. Crew's contract, it bought out the remaining six months. It also agreed to let him collect a city pension, even though he was three months away from being eligible.</p>
