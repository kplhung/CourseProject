        <p>A Columbia University graduate student who was convicted of kidnapping and raping a 20-year-old student he met on the Internet, and who then won a new trial in an appeal last year, is scheduled to be retried before the original trial judge, whom defense lawyers have accused of  bias against their client.</p>
        <p>The two sides are expected to meet Wednesday in the courtroom of the judge, William A. Wetzel of State Supreme Court in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Paul Callan, a lawyer for the defendant, Oliver Jovanovic, said the case should be assigned to ''someone who hasn't heard the evidence and hasn't developed preconceptions about the case.'' He said he planned to ask Judge Wetzel to withdraw.</p>
        <p>A retrial before the original judge is the normal practice, said David Bookstaver, spokesman for the court. If the judge refuses to step aside, the trial will almost certainly go forward under his oversight.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Judge Wetzel oversaw the trial in which Mr. Jovanovic was accused of torturing and raping a Columbia student he had befriended in an Internet chat room. The student charged that Mr. Jovanovic tied her to a bed in 1996 and tortured her for more than 20 hours. Mr. Jovanovic was convicted of sexual abuse, kidnapping and assault.</p>
        <p>The Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court overturned the conviction and harshly criticized Judge Wetzel for misusing the state's rape shield law. The judge invoked the law to prevent the defense from submitting for evidence four e-mail messages that the woman had sent to Mr. Jovanovic expressing her interest in sadomasochism. The rape shield law is intended to prevent the sexual histories of rape victims from being dredged up in a trial.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 23, 2000, Saturday  An article on Thursday about the second trial of Oliver Jovanovic, a Columbia University graduate student, on charges that he attacked a woman he met on the Internet in 1996, misstated one conviction that was overturned. At his first trial, Mr. Jovanovic was convicted of having kidnapped, sexually abused and assaulted the woman. He was not convicted of rape.</p>
