Settles Fraud Case With 15-Year-Old Student  The Securities and Exchange Commission accused a 15-year-old high school student of orchestrating a scheme to increase the prices of nine obscure, low-price stocks he had bought by sending numerous upbeat messages to investing chat rooms on the Internet, earning almost $273,000 in illegal gains.</p>
        <p>The teenager, from Cedar Grove, N.J., settled with the S.E.C. by agreeing to pay back the money he made plus interest, for a total of $285,000. Regulators said he was the first minor to be sued by the S.E.C. [Page A1.]</p>

        <p>Sprint Issues a Profit Warning  Sprint said that its core operation would fail to meet analysts' earnings expectations for the third quarter. The company added that the core unit would grow at its slowest rate since the company issued a tracking stock for its wireless division, Sprint PCS, almost two years ago. As for the wireless unit, the company said it would add about 800,000 subscribers this quarter, about 100,000 fewer than many analysts had expected. Investors dumped shares of the tracking stock, sending them down $7.81, to $33. Shares of Sprint's main stock fell $1.50, to $26.81. Market Place. [C14.]</p>
        <p>Federal Executive Faces Scrutiny  A top executive of the federal agency that guarantees pensions improperly steered $40 million worth of contracts to a minority-owned company, Congressional investigators are set to testify this morning before a joint meeting of two Senate committees. But the executive's boss said his own inquiries found nothing even mildly inappropriate. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Oil Prices Climb Above $37 a Barrel  The price of crude oil climbed amid increasing concern about the effect of the rising price on the world's economy. In New York, oil for October delivery jumped as high as $37.80 a barrel but gave up some of its gains late in the day, ending up 69 cents at $37.20. [C13.]</p>
        <p>Nasdaq Up as Other Gauges Slump  A flurry of afternoon buying lifted technology stocks and the Nasdaq composite index, but other major gauges slumped. The Nasdaq rose 31.80 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,897.44.

        <p>Auditors Propose Tighter Rules  Two large accounting firms broke rank with other firms and offered a compromise proposal to impose significant restrictions on the consulting work that accountants can do for their audit clients. The proposal, by Ernst &amp; Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers, does not go nearly as far as one that the Securities and Exchange Commission had put forth, but it would represent a victory for Arthur Levitt, the S.E.C. chairman, who seems determined to enact new rules this year.

        <p>Trade Deficit Widens to a Record  The United States trade deficit widened to a record $31.9 billion in July from $29.8 billion in June as demand for autos, oil and Chinese toys and clothes pushed imports to their highest level ever, government figures showed. [C12.]</p>
        <p>For Drug Prices, It's All in Location  When it comes to pricing for prescription drugs, the makers engage in what economists call ''third-degree price discrimination.''
