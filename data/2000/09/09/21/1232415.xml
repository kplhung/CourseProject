        <p>After my mother-in-law died nine months ago, my family found itself among the 2 percent of Americans required to pay an estate tax. Suddenly we are among those whom President Clinton and Al Gore tag as ''very rich.''</p>

It is a leap to equate all the people required to pay estate taxes -- those whose assets exceed $675,000 -- with the very wealthiest Americans.

        <p>After my mother-in-law died nine months ago, my family found itself among the 2 percent of Americans required to pay an estate tax. Suddenly we are among those whom President Clinton and Al Gore tag as ''very rich.''</p>
        <p>But my wife's parents hardly lived an elite life. It is a leap to equate all the people required to pay estate taxes -- those whose assets exceed $675,000 -- with the very wealthiest Americans. As Gene Sperling, the president's economics adviser, has noted, half of all estate-tax revenues come from the top one-tenth of 1 percent of estates -- the assets of the truly wealthy. I suspect the rest of the families are much like my wife's.</p>
        <p>Elsa and Peter emigrated to New York from Germany in the 1930's as newlyweds. They came with few possessions and even less money. They worked first in a joint endeavor, sweeping a movie theater together for minimum wage. Elsa graduated to cleaning houses and then to working as a hospital phone operator. Peter became a sales clerk. By 1940, they had entered the lower middle class, occupying a two-bedroom, fourth-floor apartment in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Since the eventual value of their assets put them in the ranks of the exceptionally rich -- or so the sound bites would imply -- the next chapter in this story might be expected to feature my in-laws starting an enormously successful company. In fact, Peter remained a sales clerk until his death in 1989 at 87, and Elsa retired from 40 years of answering phones. She died in the same fourth-floor apartment the couple had first occupied 55 years before. In their lives, they owned one car, a 1960 Dodge. Their daughter (my wife) worked from the time she was 16.</p>
        <p>By living frugally, Peter and Elsa managed to put away a few dollars every month, investing in what they considered to be safe stocks. (AT&amp;T was their largest holding.) When my father-in-law died, the savings were a cushion for his wife, but not even on the radar screen of the estate tax threshold.</p>
        <p>His widow, then approaching 80, was satisfied to have the cushion to provide for contingencies (read: nursing home). And near the end of her life, when it was clear that she wouldn't outlive her assets, she was proud she would be leaving money to her daughter and grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Then the stock market took off, and now my wife is about to give Uncle Sam a big chunk of Peter and Elsa's lifetime investments -- more than a third of everything over $675,000. (The tax is graduated, with a top rate of 55 percent.)</p>
        <p>If my in-laws had been among the really rich, they would have had a coterie of tax lawyers setting up trusts to shield their heirs from a portion of the tax bill. Instead, like most people with middle-class lifestyles, they had a plain-vanilla approach to financial planning.</p>
        <p>Most children and grandchildren who must forfeit part of an inheritance are from similarly middle-class families where assets arose from hard work and steady savings -- family values that shouldn't be penalized.</p>
