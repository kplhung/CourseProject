        <p>The advertising war over prescription drugs escalated this week: the Republican National Committee broadcast a biting new commercial in 17 states, and the Gore campaign quickly responded.</p>
        <p>PRODUCERS -- Cold Harbor Films for the Republicans, The Campaign Company for the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The Republican advertisement features a notebook that is ostensibly comparing the Bush and Gore prescription drug plans. Under the Gore column, ''Charges Seniors $600 Big Government Access Fee Annually.'' Under the Bush column, ''Seniors Choose Coverage.'' The advertisement summarizes all its accusations against Gore, then cuts to the Democratic candidate himself in a television set, while the words appear, ''Gore's Rx Plan? PrescriptionForDisaster.com.'' As the advertisement ends, Mr. Gore is speaking with the sound turned off, but he appears to be saying, ''For you.''</p>
        <p>The Democratic advertisement opens with the picture of a Washington Post analysis of a Bush television commercial, saying it ''misrepresents'' Mr. Gore's policy on prescription drugs. It then cuts to images of the elderly with Mr. Gore, and with health care providers, while the words ''The Facts'' appear on the screen, buttressing what the narrator says. ''Al Gore covers all seniors through Medicare, not an H.M.O.,'' one screen says. The advertisement also shows Mr. Bush, then cuts to elderly people talking to what is apparently intended to be an H.M.O. bureaucrat. The words on the screen: ''Bush forces seniors to go to H.M.O.'s and insurance companies. ... They have no choice.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT</p>
        <p>THE REPUBLICAN AD -- Narrator: ''On prescription medicines, compare: Al Gore will charge seniors a new $600-a-year government access fee. George Bush opposes Gore's $600 fee. Gore's plan: When seniors turn 64, they must join a drug H.M.O. selected by Washington or they are on their own.  Bush's plan: Seniors choose, and it covers all catastrophic health care costs. Gore's plan doesn't and has a government H.M.O. and a $600 fee. A prescription for disaster.''</p>
        <p>THE GORE AD -- Narrator: ''Newspapers say George Bush's prescription drug ad misrepresents the facts.  In fact, Al Gore's plan covers all seniors through Medicare, not an H.M.O. Under Gore, seniors choose their own doctor and doctors decide what drugs to prescribe. George Bush forces seniors to go to H.M.O.'s and insurance companies for prescription drugs. They have no choice. And Bush leaves millions of middle-class seniors with no coverage. Al Gore -- the only prescription plan that gives all seniors coverage and choice.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY</p>
        <p>THE REPUBLICAN AD -- The ''government access fee'' the Bush campaign talks about is the estimated premium for a year's worth of prescription drug coverage in the year 2009 -- eight years after the Gore plan takes effect. The premium in the first year is $25 a month, or $300 a year. It is impossible to compare it with Mr. Bush's, because his plan makes few commitments on premiums, deductibles or copayments. But Democratic analysts assert that the cost to beneficiaries under Mr. Bush's proposal would be significantly higher.</p>
        <p>The accusation that people are ''forced,'' under the Gore plan, to join a ''government H.M.O.'' is misleading. The Gore plan is voluntary; the elderly are free to get their prescription drug coverage through retiree plans, through H.M.O.'s, through Medicare or to waive coverage altogether. The new drug benefit would be provided through the Medicare program. The ''government H.M.O.'' is apparently the pharmaceutical benefit managers, essentially middlemen who administer these benefits in the private sector and would also do so for Medicare. The Bush plan, many analysts say, would actually rely more heavily on H.M.O.'s and other private health plans.</p>
        <p>THE GORE AD -- This is essentially a defensive advertisement, responding to the accusations of the Republicans. But it also makes a few accusations of its own -- that the Bush plan would force seniors to go to H.M.O.'s and insurance companies for drug coverage. While the Bush plan would encourage more involvement by private health plans in Medicare, Mr. Bush has said that people could stay in the traditional government program and still have the ability to get drug coverage; the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, would be required to offer a ''high option'' plan that includes drugs, although the details are not yet clear.</p>
        <p>The accusation that the plan would leave behind ''millions of middle-class seniors'' is partly based on the fact that the initial thrust of his plan would involve aid to states to help low-income elderly.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The Republican advertisement is appealing to two powerful fears: The fear of ''big government'' intruding into private health care decisions, and the fear of H.M.O.'s doing the same thing. The ''big government'' argument is a traditional line of attack against Democrats, although, of course, Medicare is, itself, a big government program and a very popular one. The attack against ''Big Government H.M.O.'s'' in the Gore plan may be a simple attempt at inoculation. Mr. Bush's plan envisions a greater role by H.M.O.'s and other private plans in Medicare, and Republicans have been bracing for a Democratic assault against it.</p>
        <p>Democrats, meanwhile, are offering themselves as guardians of Medicare, portraying the Republicans as bent on privatizing the system. With a month and a half to go to Election Day, the advertising debate is already reminiscent of the last two big health policy struggles: over Medicare restructuring in 1995-96, and over national health insurance in 1993-94.</p>
