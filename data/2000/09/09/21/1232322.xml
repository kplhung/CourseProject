        <p>THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER &amp; CLAY  By Michael Chabon  639 pages. Random House. $26.95.</p>
        <p>One night in 1939 in Brooklyn, Sammy Clayman's mother ''burst into his bedroom, applied the ring and iron knuckles of her left hand to the side of his cranium, and told him to move over and make room in the bed for his cousin from Prague.'' Thus began the partnership between Sammy and Josef Kavalier, in a meeting terrifically auspicious not only for these two future comic book auteurs but for Michael Chabon, the wizard who conjured them.</p>
        <p>With ''The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay,'' Mr. Chabon has fashioned a big, ripe, excitingly imaginative novel and set it in the world of his grandfather, a New York City typographer at a plant where comics were printed. The book's world is also one of impending crisis, with World War II looming and Joe's Jewish parents and brother still in Czechoslovakia, from which they urged Joe to escape. With Houdini as his hero and the Holocaust on the horizon, Joe quickly becomes acclimated to America (''Do you like gum?'' ''I feel I must learn to.'') and ready to use one of its homegrown art forms as a hedge against futility, an expression of defiance, a repository of dark humor and even a weapon of war.</p>
        <p>In loving if sometimes windy detail, since his great book is buried inside a larger and more meandering one, the prodigiously talented author of ''Wonder Boys'' leads readers into the world of Sam and Joe's pop collaboration. ''In 1939 the American comic book, like the beavers and cockroaches of prehistory, was larger and, in its cumbersome way, more splendid than its modern descendant,'' he explains, and proceeds to show us why. From the imaginations of Kavalier, the newly Anglicized Clay and their comrades (''ink-smirched young men, drinking, smoking, lying around with their naked big toes protruding from the tips of their socks'') spring a wide array of superheros, some more viable than others. One early creation, Radio Wave, is supposed to transmit himself through the air in his quest to right injustice. Unfortunately, ''it was soon apparent to Sammy that once they were wise to him, all the crooks in Radio Wave's hometown need simply turn off their radios in order to thrive unmolested.''</p>
        <p>In an exchange that captures the extravagantly playful intelligence at work here, Mr. Chabon describes what happens when Kavalier and Clay dream up a nocturnal moth-based comic-book superheroine and present her to their boss, Shelly Anapol:</p>
        <p>'' 'Those are very large breasts, boys.' ''</p>
        <p>'' 'We know it, Mr. Anapol,' said Sammy.''</p>
        <p>'' 'But a moth, I don't know, it's not a popular insect. Why can't she be a butterfly? There must be some good names there. Red, uh, what? Red Dot . . . Bluewing . . . Pearly . . . I don't know.' ''</p>
        <p>'' 'She can't be a butterfly,' said Sammy. 'She's the Mistress of the Night.' ''</p>
        <p>'' 'That's another thing: we can't say ''mistress.'' Already I'm getting 50 letters a week from priests and ministers. A rabbi from Schenectady. Luna Moth. Luna Moth.' The look of incipient nausea had come into his eyes and slack jaw. They were going to make themselves a pile with this.''</p>
        <p>The team's biggest pile (most of which is appropriated by Anapol, in a book as savvy about the business of comic books as it is about the aesthetics) comes from the Escapist. Described as ''Houdini, but mixed with Robin Hood and a little bit of Albert Schweitzer,'' the Escapist is the character who sends Hitler reeling in ways that thrill the authors as much as they alarm Anapol. ''One of these days you're going to go too far,'' Anapol complains about Joe's drawings of wartime violence. ''Somebody is going to get hurt.''</p>
        <p>''Somebody is getting hurt already,'' Joe replies, with the carefully understated gravity that permeates this story. Even when Mr. Chabon is slipping deftly from realistic narrative into wittily hyperbolic comic-book-ese, as he does to take part in the characters' bursts of creativity each time a new character is invented, the book's essential seriousness and thematic heft are never diminished.</p>
        <p>In a cameo-studded book (Salvador Dali at a party, Orson Welles praising the Escapist) that echoes ''Ragtime,'' just as it sometimes suggests John Irving in fanciful mode, Mr. Chabon tells a bustling, convoluted story in an eloquent, exceptionally precise voice. (Dictionary-busters like ''susurrant,'' ''nystagmus'' and ''psittacosis'' readily turn up.) Joe's love affair with Rosa Luxemburg Saks, a surrealist with ties to a Fifth Avenue department store, is interspersed with Sammy's covert romance with a hunky actor named Tracy Bacon. When he brings Bacon home to meet his mother, Sammy is described as having ''the world's largest piece of trayf in tow.''</p>
        <p>Integrated into these New York events is the grim shadow of Joe's family in Europe, with his efforts to rescue his brother constituting a major theme of the story. Joe draws the Escapist largely as a means of raising money for little Thomas Kavalier's own escape. But history intrudes on Joe's brotherly devotion in ways that underscore the metaphorical value of the book's escapist thread. ''The true magic of this broken world,'' Mr. Chabon writes hauntingly, ''lay in the ability of the things it contained to vanish, to become so thoroughly lost, that they might never have existed in the first place.''</p>
        <p>Especially impressive about ''The Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay'' is its success in reaching for big settings (the top of the Empire State Building), big creative leaps (''Citizen Kane'' plays a role here) and big historical relevance without strain. Early in the book, in Prague, that mighty figure of Hebrew lore, the golem, is physically made part of Joe's escape from peril. Later on, in the duo's comic book heyday, the golem becomes a prototype for their Nazi-defeating superhero.</p>
        <p>And at last, when the characters' personal dramas have played out and led them to a Levittown-like suburban setting, and one of the cousins has ''allowed the world to wind him in the final set of chains, and climbed, once and for all, into the cabinet of mysteries that was the life of an ordinary man,'' the book's single overriding image can be seen in a new light. Years after the war and the reign of the Escapist, Rosa tells Joe: ''In 1954, I don't think the golem makes you such an idiot anymore.''</p>
        <p>BOOKS OF THE TIMES  Correction:  April 19, 2001, Thursday  A thumbnail sketch on Tuesday about the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, ''The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay'' by Michael Chabon, referred incorrectly in some copies to the original surname of a title character, as did a correction in this space yesterday. (The name was also incorrect on Sept. 21 in a review of the book.) The character is Samuel Louis Klayman, not Clayton or Clayman. In the novel he changes his name to Sam Clay and is also referred to as Sammy Clay.</p>
