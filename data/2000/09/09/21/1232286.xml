        <p>It keeps Spanish hours, lures patrons from the restaurant next door and offers modern and refinished vintage furnishings. Homework, right, a new store opened by Laser Rosenberg, an interior designer, is next to a restaurant named Ammo. Mr. Rosenberg opens his store at 11 a.m., then closes it at 3 p.m. to see clients. Come 7 p.m., and the rush to dine at Ammo, Mr. Rosenberg opens again, and stays open until 11. In addition to his own work, like two pillows covered with 1970's fabrics, left ($78 for small and $98 for large pillows), Homework sells products by other American and European designers. At right are, foreground, an Ultrasuede pillow by Angela Adams ($375)and a white lacquered wood table by Siegel Arts of Brooklyn ($600). Homework is at 1153 North Highland Avenue (Lexington Avenue); (323) 466-1153.</p>
