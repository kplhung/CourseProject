        <p>PATTON'S first rule of war -- get the other poor blankety-blank before he gets you -- doesn't work with ragweed. It's too prolific, and a single plant's lightweight, allergenic spores, as many as one million a day, blow too far in the wind to let you solve your watering, itching and sneezing problems in your own backyard. Samples of ragweed pollen have been collected 400 miles at sea and 2 miles high, the National Institutes of Health says.</p>
        <p>But that doesn't mean giving up. One of Patton's other rules does apply: Know your enemy.</p>

        <p>PATTON'S first rule of war -- get the other poor blankety-blank before he gets you -- doesn't work with ragweed. It's too prolific, and a single plant's lightweight, allergenic spores, as many as one million a day, blow too far in the wind to let you solve your watering, itching and sneezing problems in your own backyard. Samples of ragweed pollen have been collected 400 miles at sea and 2 miles high, the National Institutes of Health says.</p>
        <p>But that doesn't mean giving up. One of Patton's other rules does apply: Know your enemy.</p>
        <p>To help with identification, the Plants Database of the federal Department of Agriculture (plants .usda.gov) gives profiles of more than 20 ragweed varieties, along with many other plants. Under common ragweed, the site has links to several picture displays, notably those from the Weed Science Society of America, showing ragweed as a seedling, a young plant and a mature plant.</p>
        <p>A good text and picture site is from the Oklahoma State University Cooperative Extension Service. You may not need herbicide advice for alfalfa, but there are close-ups of ragweed stages (www.agr.plantsoil .okstate.edu/alfalfa/webnews /common%20ragweed.htm).</p>
        <p>A page on ragweed from the University of Tulsa (bio44.utulsa.edu /homepages/levetin/ragweed.htm) gives a scientific description of the common ragweed plant (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), which it calls the most important cause of allergenic rhinitis and pollen asthma in North America. Two species of ragweed, it notes, account for more hay fever than all other plants together. Pollen release normally occurs in midmorning, it says.</p>
        <p>A thorough account of ragweed, complete with literary references, was compiled by Larry W. Mitich (ext.agn.uiuc.edu/wssa/subpages /weed/10-1.htm). Why ragweed acquired a beautiful generic name like Ambrosia, which means food for the gods, is not known, he writes. He quotes an earlier speculation that whoever first used the word ''may have had the equine god in mind, for horses are very fond of this species.''</p>
        <p>Hay fever, or allergic rhinitis, affects more than 15 percent of the population, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Its page of advice (www.allergy.mcg.edu/patients /index.html) explains the various forms of rhinitis, which can be seasonal or permanent and can be caused by many substances besides pollen, including mold spores, dust mites, animal dander and certain foods. Treatment options include avoidance, medication and allergy shots.</p>
        <p>You may not be able to avoid ragweed entirely, but the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has a short page on prevention strategies (www.niehs.nih.gov /airborne/prevent/ragweed.html).  Another important government site on allergies, titled Something in the Air, from the National Institutes of Health, is at www.niaid.nih.gov /publications/allergens/full.htm.</p>
        <p>Asthma can be a killer and can be aggravated by many of the same things that cause hay fever. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (www.aafa.org) is a comprehensive online resource for adults and children. For harder science, a collection of abstracts of original papers, editorials and correspondence about asthma from The New England Journal of Medicine is at www.nejm.org/content/collections /asthma.asp.</p>
