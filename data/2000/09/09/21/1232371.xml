        <p>When Erin O'Connor suggested last week that beauty is boring, the actual term she used was unprintable French gutter slang. If hers was a remark unexpected from a model, it should be noted that Ms. O'Connor in no way typifies the breed.</p>
        <p>For starters, there are her looks. Unlike the certifiably gorgeous stick figures who Richard Avedon once complained have faces as nuanced as pie plates, Ms. O'Connor has a complex and unconventional beauty. With her high-bridged and prominent nose, her milky complexion, her full lips and almost exaggeratedly long neck she bears more than a passing resemblance to Jacqueline de Ribes, the French noblewoman and fashion designer. And in fact, Ms. O'Connor, 22, has the kind of looks that are often termed aristocratic, whatever that might mean, although she is from a working-class family in Birmingham, England.</p>

        <p>When Erin O'Connor suggested last week that beauty is boring, the actual term she used was unprintable French gutter slang. If hers was a remark unexpected from a model, it should be noted that Ms. O'Connor in no way typifies the breed.</p>
        <p>For starters, there are her looks. Unlike the certifiably gorgeous stick figures who Richard Avedon once complained have faces as nuanced as pie plates, Ms. O'Connor has a complex and unconventional beauty. With her high-bridged and prominent nose, her milky complexion, her full lips and almost exaggeratedly long neck she bears more than a passing resemblance to Jacqueline de Ribes, the French noblewoman and fashion designer. And in fact, Ms. O'Connor, 22, has the kind of looks that are often termed aristocratic, whatever that might mean, although she is from a working-class family in Birmingham, England.</p>
        <p>It's well known that all models are discovered either while shopping or at an airport baggage carousel. As for Ms. O'Connor, she was spotted in a London department store in 1996, and was soon thereafter cast by Tom Ford for a Gucci runway show.</p>
        <p>Since then she has worked nonstop -- not just on the runway, which might be expected given her coat-hanger shoulders and air of languid remove -- but in editorial collaborations with a Who's Who of fashion photographers, in spreads for Vogue, Bazaar, Elle and such hipster magazines as I.D. and The Face. More important, both to Ms. O'Connor's bank account and in terms of expanding beauty ideals, she has done campaigns for Chanel and Armani, and is the face of Jean Paul Gaultier perfume.</p>
        <p>Caught backstage at the tents before the Oscar de la Renta show Tuesday, Ms. O'Connor was philosophical about her success. ''I am not considered a beautiful person,'' she said. Seated beside a makeup table, her arms wrapped around her knees, she added that ''faces with character can be so much more beautiful, and I don't say that in a vain way.'' After all, she noted, ''there are plenty of women in the world with pale skin and very slim figures and big noses. Maybe it's freeing if they can see pictures of someone like me.''</p>
        <p>All told, it was a rough week for reptiles. First, there was a front page article in this newspaper about some nutty Floridians who make a living putting alligators into half nelsons. More worrying still for anyone with a soft spot for snouted cylindrical creatures with pea brains and scaly hides was the proliferation during Fashion Week of former alligators now turned into Hermes Kelly bags, Ralph Lauren car coats, Calvin Klein trousers and Cynthia Rowley skirts.</p>
        <p>And anyone not seen sporting alligator was probably dressed in the pelt of another lizard. Anna Wintour of Vogue was spotted in a white belted knee-length python coat. The socialite Blaine Trump turned up for a round of shows wearing an alligator Ralph Lauren jacket. Kate Betts, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, preferred her crocodile in the form of sexy Manolo Blahnik stilettos, dyed blue. They were by no means alone.</p>
        <p>Luckily, animal rights campaigners did not stage sneak attacks, as they did during the February showings of Michael Kors's and Oscar de la Renta's collections for fall. (Mr. de la Renta now makes public appearances shadowed by a bodyguard.)</p>
        <p>''We always try to defend the least popular animals,'' Dan Mathews, media director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said by phone, before tonight's PETA party at Spa, whose hosts are to be Sandra Bernhard and Todd Oldham. The theme of the party is summed up by buttons the group had made up for the occasion: Animals Are Not Fabric.</p>
        <p>Another, possibly more effective form of antipelt propaganda was suggested by a venture capitalist attending some shows. Maybe the animal rights people could get  fashionistas to change, this man suggested, ''by playing up the symbolic aspect of dressing as a coldhearted snake.''</p>
        <p>''They just send me all these nice clothes,'' said Kristin Davis, the actress who plays an unctuous, marriage-crazed art dealer in ''Sex and the City.'' Seated in the front row alongside Milla Jovovich at Mr. Kors's show, Ms. Davis was wearing a red silk shirt, a skirt with a geometric pattern and lizard stilettos.</p>
        <p>There was nothing out of the ordinary about that. She is, to quote Ray Davies, a dedicated follower of fashion. What seemed odd, however, was that only a short while earlier she had been spotted in the front row of Ralph Lauren's show, dressed head to toe in garments of his.</p>
        <p>''I'm a very quick change,'' said Ms. Davis, explaining that she had raced to her Upper West Side apartment between shows to switch outfits. ''It's not hard since I'm only going to shows that I like,'' she explained. ''I mean, I'm not going to be like Cher or anything, checking into bathrooms to change.''</p>
