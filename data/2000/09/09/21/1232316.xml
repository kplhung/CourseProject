        <p>China is gone. There will be no replay of the 1996 Summer Games final, no replay of the 1999 World Cup final. And the new American coach, April Heinrichs, will not exactly wax sentimental at not presiding over a rematch.</p>

        <p>China is gone. There will be no replay of the 1996 Summer Games final, no replay of the 1999 World Cup final. And the new American coach, April Heinrichs, will not exactly wax sentimental at not presiding over a rematch.</p>
        <p>''You've got to be kidding,'' Heinrichs said. ''I am standing on the shore giving a wave. Thank God they're gone.''</p>
        <p>Heinrichs's farewell salute should not be taken as an insult to China. Heinrichs knows she escaped two rugged opponents at the very same time tonight. The American women advanced to the semifinals of the second Summer Games soccer tournament for women by surviving Nigeria, by a score of 3-1 and with no apparent broken limbs.</p>
        <p>At the very same time, China was being knocked off by Norway, 2-1, which means that the United States and Norway, the two most bitter foes in women's soccer, have advanced to opposite semifinals. The Yanks meet Brazil on Sunday in Canberra; Norway meets Germany on Sunday in Sydney.</p>
        <p>China is always the future -- in population, in production, in geopolitics, and maybe even in soccer. In the very short run, however, China will not be standing in the way of the Americans in the finals, as it did in the manic University of Georgia stadium in 1996, and as it did in the rocking Rose Bowl in California in 1999. There is a new script.</p>
        <p>The Americans keep coming back. They do not appear to be as fearsome as in 1996 and 1999 when they had two major advantages -- screaming national crowds and the greatest female player who has ever lived, Michelle Akers, now retired from international play because of too much stress on her weary body.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if she is retired, but I was happy when I didn't see her,'' said Ismaila Mabo, the Nigerian coach.</p>
        <p>Only a year ago, Akers scored two goals as the Americans routed Nigeria, 7-1, in Chicago, but more to the point, Akers showed the way by separating opponent from ball by whatever means were necessary.</p>
        <p>Now there is no more Akers stalking her prey. Carla Overbeck, the captain, recovering from Graves' disease, resides on the bench, shouting instructions that can be heard in the gigantic but relatively empty Melbourne Cricket Ground. The United States is not the team it was. On the other hand, there are the teams of the future.</p>
        <p>''All I know is that in 1999 we lost, 7-1, and today it was 3-1,'' Mabo said. ''Perhaps the next time we play, it will be a win. From what I saw tonight, we played better than the U.S.A.''</p>
        <p>He had the right to say that because Nigeria forced the action with aggression and speed. ''After 30 minutes, it looked like we had all that time and space,'' Heinrichs said about the view from the bench. ''But none of us were in the position of having our legs ripped off.''</p>
        <p>Nigerian women come in hard and fast, with cleats flying. They sent Tiffeny Milbrett sprawling with a sore wrist and they dumped Brandi Chastain, and Heinrichs pulled Christine Lilly and Mia Hamm before they got hurt. And, Nigeria showed growing sophistication for attack. ''With very little funding from their federation, they are one of the six best teams in the world,'' Heinrichs said.</p>
        <p>''They're kind of a wild team,'' said Julie Foudy. ''It's always a little unsettling to play them. You have a lot of space. They tackle hard, but sometimes they make mistakes.''</p>
        <p>Nigeria took the play to the United States early, but the Yanks went ahead on a corner kick in the 26th minute. Hamm fired past the goal mouth, Foudy headed the ball on goal, and Chastain volleyed the goal with her foot.</p>
        <p>Six minutes later, Lilly fired a shot that seemed destined to clear the goal mouth but was deflected by Perpetua Nkwocha. It could have been scored an own goal, but Lilly got credit for it.</p>
        <p>Three minutes into the second half, Nigeria's most celebrated player, Mercy Akide, turned Kate Sobrero, split two other defenders, and flicked the ball past Siri Mullinix. Afterward, Ifeanyichukwu Chiejene performed a series of back flips that could have earned her a gymnastics medal in far-off Sydney.</p>
        <p>The United States scored again in the 56th minute on Shannon MacMillan's screeching line-drive free kick over the wall and over the hands of the goalkeeper. And although Nigeria scattered bodies and kept the pressure on, it could not score.</p>
        <p>Now the Yanks are in the semifinals, and they still haven't played in the Olympic city itself. ''We're having a great time in Canberra,'' Foudy said. ''We were in Sydney for the opening ceremony, and it's a lot of chaos. We're happy the way it is. We'll get there.''</p>
        <p>The final is in Sydney. The Yanks have no guarantee they will be there, but Nigeria is beaten back and China is gone. Not a bad night's work.</p>
