        <p>MARRE MOEREL, a fresh-faced, pigtailed, 34-year-old lighting designer, walked through the industrial hangar where Cappellini, the Italian furniture manufacturer, was having its press preview during the Milan furniture fair last April, greeting peers and smiling nonstop.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moerel, who looks more like an Olympic swimmer than an ex-art student, was on top of the world. Cappellini, the Vatican of design houses, had just signed her and her lamps to a three-year contract. To a young designer, it was an answered prayer.</p>
        <p>''Their collection is so immaculate, the most progressive,'' she said last month, sitting in the kitchen of her Hester Street apartment in New York (the shower was in the kitchen, too). What Ms. Moerel discussed next is the part of design that never gets talked about -- not what's new, what's now, but what's the deal: in this case, a few thousand dollars, a 3 percent royalty on sales and no promises to take what you do in the future.</p>
        <p>''Basically you can't live off of it,'' she said. Ms. Moerel's monthly expenses are $2,000. She works as an artist's assistant to pay her bills.</p>
        <p>The lamps will be produced to order; all bets are off on how many that will be. Marcel Wanders's Shadow collection, which Cappellini's New York showroom said does ''very well,'' sells 50 lamps a year here. Ms. Moerel periodically thinks about becoming a sculptor again. ''A gallery would only take 50 percent, instead of 97,'' she said.</p>
        <p>To judge by the buzz, design is the hot topic right now -- it's got its own vodka-sponsored events, its own young fashionable audience pushing into the openings at stores.</p>
        <p>''I'm watching the art world of the 1980's take shape in the design community,'' said Tony Whitfield, chairman of the product design department at Parsons School of Design. With few exceptions, though, young independent designers are the 21st century's new starving artists, hard pressed to translate their talents into careers with designs that will be manufactured, marketed or sold with any success. ''The media engine is producing design stars,'' Mr. Whitfield said, ''but if you examine their livelihoods, you'll find they're not congruent.''</p>
        <p>Design's popular image resides in renegade figures like Philippe Starck. The tattooed Mr. Starck is in Minneapolis today presenting his vision of inexpensive housewares to the Target Corporation. Or Michael Graves -- Target has sold millions of dollars' worth of the architect's merchandise since introducing it last year. Both designers received a fee, plus less than 3 percent royalties. Or Karim Rashid, whose 1996 plastic Garbo trashcan for Umbra, retailing for approximately $7, is a 1.5 million-unit bestseller. Mr. Karim got no design fee, but a royalty of roughly 3 percent.</p>
        <p>Because of the buzz, and the new ubiquity of design awareness in corporate America -- a k a jobs -- enrollment in design programs is up at the fine art graduate schools.</p>
        <p>''Kids, youth culture, exist with design in a way they never have before,'' said Peter Stathis, who heads a design department at Cranbrook Academy of Art. ''It was an invisible profession. Now there is much more awareness from even parents that this is a career option.''</p>
        <p>And the student is changing, too.</p>
        <p>''In the past, it was a young male who had mechanical aptitude,'' Mr. Stathis said. ''Design is much more about the control of culture now. There are more women than ever, and over the last two years, a change in nationality -- from 65 percent American and European to 60 percent Asian. The Westernization of the world is taking hold, and students want to be close to the culture that's setting the tone of trends globally.''</p>
        <p>But having the ideas is the easy part, it turns out. Getting their designs out of the studio and into your house is the problem many young designers resist tackling or fail to solve. Independence has its price.</p>
        <p>David Metzger's Brooklyn business, Design This, exhibited 10 basic wood furniture pieces in New York last year to much acclaim.</p>
        <p>With cost-effective manufacturing lined up in Romania to produce the minimal designs with a maximum of craft, the designer took large orders: 60 pieces from one store alone. Seeing the volume, the manufacturer got cold feet and backed out. Mr. Metzger, a cabinetmaker, executed a few individual pieces himself, refusing the bulk orders. It cost him $60,000, out of his own blue-jeaned pocket, to get the collection to the fair. He broke even.</p>
        <p>The designs themselves are now up for sale: Mr. Metzger is looking for licensees. He is also looking for employment. His annual income has been $50,000 for 10 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Metzger, 34, giggles with incredulity when you mention how hot design is, or the great parties. ''Everybody sort of wants to be a furniture designer now,'' he said. ''But it's difficult to do. It's a weird thing. I've been independent for 10 years, and I look at succumbing to corporate America as a failure.'' Mr. Metzger acknowledged that a company like Crate &amp; Barrel could effectively make the designs inexpensively, in Indonesia, but that the level of quality in the products would be lower than his intentions for them.</p>
        <p>GRANGER MOORHEAD, 31, a Yale-trained architect, and his brother, Robert, 27, a Rhode Island School of Design graduate in industrial design, are now designing furniture together in the Canal Street loft where the younger Mr. Moorhead also lives. The Moorheads exhibited their first two products -- a folded-felt stool and a rubber hanging lamp -- at the New York fair in May, as a way of running up their flag. Ray Kennedy, director of Herman Miller for the Home, an influential visitor to young designers trying to break out of anonymity, took a hard sniff at the Moorheads' tiny booth but has not made a move to pick the products up. A contract with Cappellini or Herman Miller can be a step onto the ladder toward work with companies like Target.</p>
        <p>Granger's architectural commissions, with Robert's assistance, pay the bills. The Moorheads haven't developed their designs with manufacturing or a customer in mind, though like young designers' standard heroes, the Eameses, they would like them to be accessible, even affordable.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I've been very practical about that,'' Robert Moorhead said. ''My direction has never been with an end result in mind. It's been more of an artistic exploration, discovering what materials have to offer, and trying to express that.''</p>
        <p>Without making the calls, the wait for a break could be long.</p>
        <p>''I talked to a hundred companies in the United States,'' Mr. Rashid said, recalling the start of his design business in 1993. ''Letters, phone calls, going to visit. I got one client.'' His office now has 22 employees and billings of over $1 million. He has, by his count, executed 900 projects in seven years, including Garbo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rashid isn't interested in manufacturing his designs, either, but has no problem in getting them produced. His advice: ''Young designers tend to chase companies who are established as design companies, like Cappellini,'' he said. ''Go to companies who are unknown for design, visit the factory, see what the weaknesses are. Starting working with them -- you can do critical things, and grow together.''</p>
        <p>David Weeks's lighting designs were well received at the New York furniture fair five years ago. His business, which now grosses $150,000 annually, has had moderate success with commissions like the lamps at the newly renovated Brasserie and with retail sales at stores like Troy.</p>
        <p>''It hasn't really been a living until the last year or two,'' said Mr. Weeks, 32, sitting with his wife, Georgianna Stout, a partner in 2 x 4, a New York design studio.</p>
        <p>Now, the business is hitting a ceiling. Mr. Weeks still makes the lamps by hand, as he did when he started, subcontracting some of the manufacturing to outside companies. He produces several hundred lamps a year. He also answers the telephone and does his accounting at night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weeks is reluctant to actively look for a business partner or capitalization. He understands the potential value of a licensing arrangement with a large company (he met with George Kovacs last week) but is torn by the loss of control and equates that with personal integrity.</p>
        <p>''It's been a very instinctual business,'' he said. ''I'm not one to get my investors organized and run with a product. I mean, it should happen. It probably will in the next year.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weeks recently diversified, designing a chair. A retailer has approached him about producing it. The fee: $3,000, which would be an advance on future royalties. He has formed Butter, a second company, with Lindsey Adams, a fellow designer, to try mass-marketing their inexpensive clip-on shade. It is being sold at Urban Outfitters for $25. Butter has shipped 900 in three months, but ''we have more bills than money right now,'' Mr. Weeks said.</p>
        <p>OTHER young companies, like Blu Dot in Minneapolis, have established themselves surely -- and quickly -- by drafting a business plan as a part of their design strategy. They also don't design what can't be inexpensively produced, which made them instantly attractive to companies like Crate &amp; Barrel and Target.</p>
        <p>''Design is 30 percent of it,'' said John Christakos, a partner. ''How do you build it, how do you ship it, how do you service it -- that's the other 70 percent. Practicality is the key word. We knew that we would have to be smart about the pieces we designed and the way they were built.'' Introduced at the New York furniture fair in 1997, Blu Dot had sales of $5 million this year -- a rare success.</p>
        <p>Though the star system lights the sky over the design scene, it may be that the independent young designer is already a thing of the past, an antiquated romantic figure.</p>
        <p>''To say it's vanity is to belittle the pride of your work,'' Ellen Lupton, a curator with the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum and its recent Triennial, said in defense of the importance of designers' independence historically. ''To be able to control your product -- its quality, the ownership of the design -- is very valid. The Eameses are associated with their work for Herman Miller, but they did it from their own studio.''</p>
        <p>Many students graduating now are taking corporate jobs, as in-house designers for both big and small companies.</p>
        <p>''I have friends who went independent immediately,'' said Pearce Lashmett, 28, design director of Nanz Custom Hardware in New York, who graduated from Parsons last year. ''It seems kind of naive. I'm designing hardware, overseeing graphics. I'm learning how to bite into the market and get it done.'' His  eventual independence is a five-year plan, Mr. Lashmett said.</p>
        <p>''Design as a kind of craft is going away,'' said Mr. Stathis at Cranbrook. ''A lot of these boutique practices are becoming an anachronistic model for producing design in America. It's not necessarily a bad thing. Design is maturing. Designers need to, too.''</p>
        <p>His new puppy playing under the table, the summer evening turning to night, Mr. Weeks recalled his decision to become a designer, and the career that he thought it might be.</p>
        <p>''Let's just make beautiful objects and the people will come,'' he said. ''That's what you think.''</p>
        <p>Apparently it doesn't always work that way.</p>
