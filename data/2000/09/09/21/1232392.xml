        <p>In a lawsuit over New York City's use of pesticides to control West Nile virus, a lawyer for a coalition of environmental groups argued yesterday that using the chemicals in heavily populated areas violated federal and state environmental laws.</p>
        <p>After showing a videotape of spray trucks emitting plumes of Anvil, a pesticide, over sidewalks in Harlem, Karl S. Coplan, the lawyer, told Judge John S. Martin Jr. of Federal District Court in Manhattan that spraying the chemicals had violated federal laws.</p>
        <p>Judge Martin heard final arguments yesterday on a motion from the coalition to stop New York City from spraying until the matter can be decided in a trial.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the city, Inga Van Eysden, defended the spraying, arguing that the pesticide had been approved for mosquito control by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and that the city's use of them had the support of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
        <p>Judge Martin made no ruling in the case yesterday.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs, represented by the Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic at the Pace University School of Law, filed suit on July 20. A week later, Judge Harold A. Baer Jr. denied their motion for an emergency order to halt the spraying of Anvil, a common pesticide used by the city.</p>
        <p>The city continued to use the pesticide through the summer. Insecticides have been sprayed in all five boroughs and in Westchester and Rockland Counties, on Long Island and in Connecticut and New Jersey. The spraying is to continue until cold weather ends the mosquito season.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs argued in hearings before Judge Martin this week that the city created a public panic over the mosquito-borne virus, which killed 7 people last year and has sickened 11 this year. The city records far more cases of diseases like influenza and hepatitis, Mr. Coplan said, ''and nobody is calling this an emergency.''</p>
        <p>The suit claims that spraying the insecticide violates two state environmental laws as well as the federal Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs toxic substances that present an ''imminent and substantial endangerment'' to health or the environment.</p>
        <p>Questioned by the judge yesterday about balancing the risks of pesticide use against the risks of West Nile infection, Mr. Coplan said the spraying was prohibited by those laws ''even if you're doing it to save a life.''</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs presented three witnesses Monday who told of suffering several ill effects from the spraying.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Robert S. Hoffman, the director of the city's poison control center, testified yesterday that the concentration and amount of pesticide sprayed were ''far too small to be of concern.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Hoffman said the center had received about 300 complaints this year reporting symptoms of pesticide exposure, which he added was not significantly higher than the number received in 1998, before any spraying began.</p>
