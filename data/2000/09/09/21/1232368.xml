        <p>A school voucher initiative on the California ballot this fall would, once fully implemented, give at least $2.6 billion in taxpayer money to families -- most of them affluent -- whose children already attend private schools, according to an academic study released today.</p>
        <p>The initiative, Proposition 38,  would make all the state's students eligible for a $4,000 voucher that could be used to defray private-school tuition. While the measure is intended, in part, to help low-income parents flee failing schools, the report by Policy Analysis for California Education -- a collaboration of professors at Stanford University and University of California at Berkeley -- suggests that the primary beneficiaries may be wealthy private-school students. Even some voucher advocates have criticized the initiative for not limiting the vouchers to impoverished families or struggling schools.</p>
        <p>''This does not expand choice to more families,'' said Luis Huerta, a co-author of the report. ''It's essentially tax relief for the well off.''</p>
        <p>While the voucher costs less than the $6,313 California spends to educate each public-school student, private-school enrollment would have to more than double to 1.5 million before the state would break even on the initiative -- that is, before the money saved by students leaving the system would make up for the vouchers given to children already in private school. Current private schools report only 32,000 vacant seats, though more schools would probably be created if the initiative passed.</p>
        <p>The report said, ''It's likely that the most disadvantaged children -- those from low-income families with minimally educated parents -- would be the ones left behind in mediocre public schools.''</p>
