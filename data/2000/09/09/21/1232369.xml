        <p>The fashion crowd gathers and regathers each day to inspect the emperors' new clothes, and as of yesterday morning, the midpoint of the spring 2001 collections, there were just two boss designers, Ralph Lauren and Daryl Kerrigan, and they had a lot to say about how women will be dressing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lauren cut to the chase by throwing out color. No tulip-time pinks or screaming roadhouse aquas for him. The clothes he showed yesterday in SoHo were all in black and white or brown and white, and the only hint of color that appeared on the runway was the orange in the beads peeking out from the neck of Mr. Lauren's long-sleeve T-shirt as he took his bow. He wore black and white. His family wore black and white. It was Ralph noir.</p>

        <p>The fashion crowd gathers and regathers each day to inspect the emperors' new clothes, and as of yesterday morning, the midpoint of the spring 2001 collections, there were just two boss designers, Ralph Lauren and Daryl Kerrigan, and they had a lot to say about how women will be dressing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lauren cut to the chase by throwing out color. No tulip-time pinks or screaming roadhouse aquas for him. The clothes he showed yesterday in SoHo were all in black and white or brown and white, and the only hint of color that appeared on the runway was the orange in the beads peeking out from the neck of Mr. Lauren's long-sleeve T-shirt as he took his bow. He wore black and white. His family wore black and white. It was Ralph noir.</p>
        <p>''I did so much color before, this was the only way to go,'' he said in the postshow crush. And did anyone on his staff raise a doubt? ''Oh, everyone,'' he acknowledged. ''They said, 'What are you doing?' ''</p>
        <p>The absence of color was not what really set the collection apart. It was the absence of blather, the lack of what might be expressed typographically as ''#####'' -- that is, static. Mr. Lauren took a line with this collection, and stuck to it, sending out lean suits and sleeveless dresses in white leather etched in black; soft, knife-pleated skirts with simple shell tops; a languid V-neck jersey dress with a wide, low-slung cinch belt, and dressy-casual evening separates in lace or chevron-striped silk.</p>
        <p>In a season crammed with references to this vintage style and that editorial look, Mr. Lauren chose to take himself out of the fray, and the upshot was a collection that, from cut to simplicity of line, needed no excess logic or artificial noise to express what could be said with a clean, clear ''!''</p>
        <p>To say that the women in Ms. Kerrigan's superb Daryl K show on Tuesday night looked like gladiators as they came out in raw-looking tunics with leather belts and leggings of sequins and ruching gives not quite the right impression. It implies a male-dominated world, and Ms. Kerrigan is one designer who knows how young women today want to dress -- with feminine wiles but also strength.</p>
        <p>This came through in a mutton-sleeve denim jacket smocked eccentrically in the back and worn over a hard brown suede mini with a rust petticoat, and in the almost military braids of silver sequins than ran over the sloping shoulders of a pale pink cotton tunic dress. But the attitude was summed up best, perhaps, in a much-gathered top worn by Maggie Rizer over a fierce little skirt of metallic leather. Ms. Kerrigan's feat was to connect the easy girlishness of the 1980's to the mean here-and-now.</p>
        <p>Betsey Johnson's show on Tuesday night was hilarious: 29 Playboy bunnies, and her grown-up daughter, Lulu, skipped and grinned under the hot lights. One has never seen such a display of teeth -- and what little feet bunnies have. Not those size-10 models' clydes, and none of that business of walking like a trained poodle, with one foot hooking robotically in front of the other. The bunnies walked naturally. Oh, sure, they'd get to the end of the runway where the photographers were waiting and do the human equivalent of a cherry on top of a sundae -- look tempting -- but they were just being themselves.</p>
        <p>Before the show, Hillary Alexander, a fashion reporter for The Daily Telegraph of London, confronted a photographer who tried to get some leering shots of the bunnies  as they were dressing. ''I said, 'Look, here,' Ms. Alexander recalled, '' 'We don't do that sort of thing anymore backstage.' '' She laughed. ''He said: 'Listen, I'm the Playboy photographer. This is what we do.' ''</p>
        <p>And, in a way, Ms. Johnson understood that. She put them in naughty nighties, cute little bustiers over flouncy skirts and in such all-girl favorites as sundresses and sheaths. Of course, one felt that the bunnies were upstaging Ms. Johnson's designs, and that was a problem. But not such a big one.</p>
        <p>Nicole Miller has a knack for knowing which way the fashion compass is pointing. If girlishness is in the air, she comes up with lanky T-shirt dresses slit at the shoulders and gathered loosely below the waist with chain belts. Her show on Tuesday had a kind of honky-tonk edge, a toughness evoked in mixes of black and purple, low-slung pants, slithery charmeuse in Art Deco prints, and stilettos with Lurex anklets. There were sweet pansy prints in chiffon, too, but Ms. Miller isn't making clothes for wallflowers.</p>
