        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The New York City Landmarks Commission should have designated the Aalto rooms a landmark years ago. These conference rooms are a thrilling masterpiece of world-class architecture -- one of the great treasures of our city and of the post-World War II era. The idea that they could be demolished or even moved from a glorious location overlooking the United Nations and the East River is a travesty. Too bad that foreigners at the Finnish Consulate care more about preserving a great interior landmark than do New York City elected officials.</p>
        <p>The rooms should be easy to save.  All the Landmarks Commission has to do is exercise its responsibility under the regulations and look at the case law designated for New York interiors. The space meets all the criteria for an interior landmark.</p>

        <p>The New York City Landmarks Commission should have designated the Aalto rooms a landmark years ago. These conference rooms are a thrilling masterpiece of world-class architecture -- one of the great treasures of our city and of the post-World War II era. The idea that they could be demolished or even moved from a glorious location overlooking the United Nations and the East River is a travesty.

        <p>Perhaps the commission hesitates to make the designation because the owners are averse to the idea. They can make more money by turning it into office space. But the commission's job is to act in the long-term public interest, not the short-term interests of individual owners. New York City's economic development relies on its attraction as a cultural, business and tourist center, which is intricately involved with landmark preservation. We all can enjoy the Four Seasons restaurant and Radio City Music Hall, which were designated against the consent of the owners of the buildings in which they are. Why not the Kaufmann Conference Center?</p>
