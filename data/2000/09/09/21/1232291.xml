        <p>SOME people here call it ''taste slippage,'' the irrational craving that sometimes overtakes expatriates in Egypt to fill their homes with lamps made from papier-mache camels, recycled-glass pyramids, mirrors shaped like minarets and framed hieroglyphics on papyrus.</p>
        <p>Ethnic reproductions, whether kitschy or craftsy, fortunately never tempted Michel Pastore, a Swiss potter turned fabric maker and decorator, and Sylva Nasrallah, a Lebanese fashion designer. Partners in a clothing and home furnishings business here called Nagada, the two have instead managed a quirky kind of fusion that hints simultaneously of the Orient and of Europe and borrows architectural forms from the Far East and Egyptian village life.</p>
        <p>In the homes that they have designed and furnished, Mrs. Nasrallah and Mr. Pastore embrace pared-down simplicity. The same is true in their geometrically cut clothing, wall hangings, upholstery, linens, lamps and bedding, all fashioned from simply designed Egyptian cotton. Their designs are not primitive so much as calming, an antidote to this dusty, cacophonous city.</p>
        <p>The two have carved out a particular niche. Most modern design in the Middle East tends toward the overwrought: lots of marble floors, gilded furniture, ornate chandeliers and reception rooms crammed with small tables loaded with figurines.</p>
        <p>''Our aesthetic goes much further than what is in our own environment,'' said Mrs. Nasrallah, a Beirut-born dynamo of Armenian heritage who came to Egypt to escape Lebanon's civil war.</p>
        <p>''What I realized over time is that you need to go to the roots of things,'' she added. ''A lot of people say, 'Your designs look Japanese.' Others say they look South American. But these countries all meet at the beginning -- look at the similarities of the ancient jewelry and pottery. When you make clothes inspired by tradition, they always meet up with other traditions.''</p>
        <p>Her design ethic married well with that of Mr. Pastore, a puckish white-bearded artist who joined forces with her five years ago to create Nagada. He, too, is a transplant to Egypt, and has lived for 30 years with his family, Robinson Crusoe style, in a sprawling mud brick compound constructed bit by bit in a desert oasis on the outskirts of Faiyum, about two hours southwest of Cairo. It is shaded by date palms and suffused with the scent of hibiscus and roses.</p>
        <p>''I can't say what comes from Europe and what comes from Egypt,'' Mr. Pastore said. ''I can't isolate one from the other, and I don't want to. What I believe, deeply, is that if you are creative, you are creative and you have to let it come.''</p>
        <p>Their creative union, like the living spaces and clothing they design, owes more to serendipity than to a master plan. They met through a mutual friend at a time when Mr. Pastore was struggling to revive production of traditional Egyptian hand-loomed cotton and Mrs. Nasrallah was scouring dusty Egyptian markets for interesting fabrics to use in her dress designs.</p>
        <p>The chemistry was right. Now, Mrs. Nasrallah's husband, Ramzi, manages the financial end of Nagada. The store's line of dinnerware and pottery, hand-decorated with imaginary animals and fanciful figures, is supplied by Mr. Pastore's longtime partner, Evelyne Porret, who runs a pottery school in their Faiyum home. And Mr. Pastore, the jack-of-all-trades in the enterprise, designed the Nasrallah family's airy and eclectic home in a 1907 apartment house on an island in the Nile, in central Cairo.</p>
        <p>It all began, though, in Nagada, one of the oldest inhabited settlements in the world. In this weaving village in Upper Egypt, the peasants had for generations produced a simple zigzag design on local cotton using hand looms that were little changed from the times of the Pharaohs.</p>
        <p>By 1990, after political tensions between Egypt and Sudan dried up the traditional market, no one was buying the primitive primary-color Nagada fabrics anymore. Mr. Pastore, recruited by friends who worked in a Canadian-financed program to help revive Egypt's impoverished south, installed himself in the village and coaxed the weavers to teach him their craft -- wordlessly, since his Arabic was minimal.</p>
        <p>Working within the limitations of the hand looms, operated by weavers on the ground in front of their homes, he brought new inspiration to Nagada based on old designs: feathery symbols resembling single stalks of grain; repeated pyramid shapes filled in with subtle striping; muted pinstripes of mauves, blues and grays.</p>
        <p>The Nagada fabric evokes classical Middle Eastern tapestry design -- the simple geometric motifs of Coptic weaving from the early centuries of Christianity and the bold lines of Islamic embroidery -- but does not mimic it. ''My idea was to find the richness of traditional design and make it modern and relevant,'' Mr. Pastore said. ''For me, the idea was to be modern in the sense of primitive.''</p>
        <p>As their business, on the third floor at 8 Dar El Shefa Street, in the Garden City neighborhood of Cairo, has become a place of pilgrimage for expatriates, diplomats and hip young Egyptians (who purchased 7,000 items last year), Mr. Pastore, 57, and Mrs. Nasrallah, 39, have ventured for variety beyond the Nagada village fabrics. (They have also set up a site on the Internet, www.nagada.net, to help promote their wares outside Egypt. In the United States, information about Nagada products is available by e-mail from: xs99@po.cwru.edu.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Pastore and Mrs. Nasrallah now occasionally garnish their clothes and linens with panels of Indian and Chinese silk. But they never choose imported fabric that screams India or China, just as their own cotton does not necessarily connote Egypt.</p>
        <p>That aversion to a stylized Orientalism comes through in Mr. Pastore's interior designs. For the Nasrallahs' 2,700-square-foot Cairo apartment, a typically sprawling space in its wealthy neighborhood, he used color, staggered ceiling heights, Nagada fabric and a bit of whimsy to create a comfortable home in which the Middle East plays just one note.</p>
        <p>The overpowering height of the ceilings, 15 feet, made Mrs. Nasrallah and her husband feel they were living in a tower. To humanize the dimensions, Mr. Pastore lowered the ceilings in the corridors, dressed them with cotton in a muted geometric pattern that evokes a Caucasian carpet, and added wood beams. To scale down the expanse of wall in other rooms, he painted the uppermost few feet in dark colors or broke up the space by painting minaret-shaped silhouettes along the walls at eye level.</p>
        <p>In one renovated bathroom, Mr. Pastore playfully borrowed from Egyptian village architecture, creating a roomy octagonal shower stall that ascends to a dome punctured with holes for venting and light. It looks like a traditional village house, built for summer coolness and winter warmth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pastore has no problem with modernity, however. The Nasrallahs' kitchen is brought down to family size by a steel grid stretching across the room to hold spot halogen lights.</p>
        <p>''When Michel designs a space, he wants you to think everything has always been there,'' said Mrs. Nasrallah, whose lattice-work wooden Egyptian furniture and collection of carved wooden doors now fit seamlessly into the apartment. ''It's space, light and colors. Then the objects are integrated. Nothing should stick out and shout.''</p>
        <p>In the house that Mr. Pastore and his family built in the Faiyum oasis, he also took his cues from the environment. Originally a set of four simple mud-brick rooms facing a central courtyard, the walled compound now encompasses pottery workshops and a lush garden of bougainvillea, hibiscus, flame trees, poinsettia and wild roses.</p>
        <p>Water from a nearby lake, visible as a ribbon of blue against the backdrop of mauve desert hills, feeds a bathing pool and a stream lined with reeds and filled with water lilies. Date palms dot the property.</p>
        <p>It was not always like this. The original houses had been built in 1967 by Ms. Porret, who is also Swiss, and her former husband. For years they stood empty. When she returned with Mr. Pastore and their two small children, in 1970, they found what they call ''a house in a desert of stones.''</p>
        <p>As they renovated and added on, the family lived a rustic life. The village, far from the center of Faiyum, had no running water or electricity for 10 years. They built when they had money and according to their needs and fancies. ''We saw that the village houses had palm trees in the courtyard, and we loved that,'' Ms. Porret recalled as she walked the winding pathway through the gardens of her backyard. ''So when we started building, we built around the palm trees that we found on the property.''</p>
        <p>And they made their own bricks. ''We built according to concrete needs,'' Mr. Pastore said. ''It was not anything terribly intellectual.''</p>
        <p>At first they enthusiastically planted everything they thought might provide shade for them and a habitat for birds. Just about everything but eucalyptus and cactus died. A covered bridge, salvaged intact, stretches from the top of one building to another. Corn grows in pockets of the garden, which is finally a colorful jumble of plants. Mud brick benches, covered with pillows and inlaid with bits of pottery, run along the inside of the courtyard.</p>
        <p>Like Nagada, it is a work in progress. ''I never begin a project with an idea that it must be this or that,'' Mr. Pastore said. ''I work totally in the present -- from present to present.''</p>
