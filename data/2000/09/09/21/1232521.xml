        <p>KOPPELMAN - Dorothy. The American Jewish Committee is profoundly saddened by the death of a treasured friend and generous benefactor, Dorothy Koppelman. Dorothy and her husband Julius have been longtime members of the AJC family, serving on our national Board of Governors, National Leadership Council, Horizon Society, and national Advisory Board of our Institute on American Jewish-Israeli Relations, for which they established an endowment in honor of their 50th wedding anniversary. Equally active in her local AJC chapter, she served as a Vice President and Trustee of AJC's Central New Jersey Chapter and was honored in 1995 with their Philip Forman Human Relations Award. A devoted wife to Julius for more than 56 years and a loving mother and grandmother, Dorothy was also an educator who made time to nurture her passion for the well-being of the Jewish people, emphasizing not only Holocaust remembrance but Jewish vitality and identity through learning. She supported, in word and deed, those causes nearest to her heart, and did so with a quiet elegance and grace that were her trademarks. Her legacy of goodness and compassion will long be remembered. We send our deepest condolences to Julius, their four daughters and their families, and all who grieve her passing. Bruce M. Ramer, President David A. Harris, Excutive Director Shulamith Bahat, Assoc. Exec. Dir.</p>
