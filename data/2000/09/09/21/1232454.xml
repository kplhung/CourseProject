        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Choosing a Salary or Tuition'' (Sept. 7), about young programmers who are forgoing college: Clearly it's too late to tell young programmers jumping into the high-tech world about the nonacademic benefits of college, like learning social skills and meeting people outside your own socioeconomic group. All that's left is to appeal to their economic and professional ambitions.</p>
        <p>The thrust of programming management for the last 20 years has been toward reducing the ''black art'' of the 60's to an ordinary craft, with fungible drones in cubicles doing one job at a time, like design, coding or testing. The impetus has not so much been economic as it has been an effort (with mixed results) to control the quality of the software being produced.</p>

        <p>Re ''Choosing a Salary or Tuition'' (Sept. 7), about young programmers who are forgoing college: Clearly it's too late to tell young programmers jumping into the high-tech world about the nonacademic benefits of college, like learning social skills and meeting people outside your own socioeconomic group.

        <p>The thrust of programming management for the last 20 years has been toward reducing the ''black art'' of the 60's to an ordinary craft, with fungible drones in cubicles doing one job at a time, like design, coding or testing.

        <p>If young people knowingly decide to start out as the tradesmen of the future, that's quite all right. But they should know that the surest route to advancement (in what they might contemptuously refer to as the ''old paradigm'') has been formal training. I don't care to buy a product from a company whose chief information officer hasn't studied ''irrelevant'' required courses like configuration management, compiler theory, numerical analysis and (most irrelevant of all to a geek) a course on ''people skills.''</p>
