        <p>A Broadway Romantic  Borrows Brazilian Rhythm  Christine Andreas  Cafe Carlyle</p>
        <p>Change can seem glacial in the staid world of New York cabaret. That's why eyebrows were raised at the recent announcement that Barbara Cook, who had traditionally opened the Cafe Carlyle's fall season, had defected to Feinstein's at the Regency. But in booking Christine Andreas as a replacement, the Carlyle has selected the most obvious candidate from the next generation of Broadway sopranos, over whom Ms. Cook looms as an artistic godmother.</p>
        <p>If Ms. Andreas, who performs at the Carlyle (35 East 76th Street, Manhattan), through Oct. 14, comes from the same unabashedly romantic tradition as Ms. Cook, her musical personality is very different. High-strung and a bit skittish, she embodies the eternal ingenue, projecting a bursting eagerness and trusting vulnerability. For her engagement at the Carlyle, she has boldly expanded her accompaniment from a single piano to a quartet led by the gifted pop-jazz pianist and arranger Lee Musiker, whose settings give many of the songs a Brazilian flavor.</p>
        <p>A lyric soprano who can float a dreamy melodic line like milkweed drifting over a field of daisies, Ms. Andreas has a high, sweet voice with a fast-pulsing vibrato that conveys the hint of sob. If she isn't entirely comfortable with the tricky Brazilian rhythms percolating below her, the purity of her voice carries her safely over most of her show's rougher spots.</p>
        <p>The most successful numbers are ballads like Antonio Carlos Jobim's ''How Insensitive,'' Billy Joel's ''And So It Goes'' and ''Storybook'' (her signature song from ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'') that play into her image of a beautiful dreamer newly awakened to the reality that life may not bring the fairy tale ending she had always imagined.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare and Standards  In Experienced Hands  Dame Cleo Laine  Feinstein's at the Regency</p>
        <p>In 1964 the British singer Dame Cleo Laine recorded a groundbreaking album, ''Shakespeare and All That Jazz,'' that featured settings of Shakespeare's poetry by her husband, John Dankworth. You might think that after all these years Mr. Dankworth's iconoclastic hybrids of classic literature and relaxed pop-jazz were little more than period curiosities. Well, think again.</p>
        <p>At the opening night show of a two-week engagement that runs through Saturday at Feinstein's at the Regency (Park Avenue and 61st Street), Dame Cleo and a quartet led by Mr. Dankworth brought back four of them: ''All the World's a Stage,'' ''If Music Be,'' ''Where the Bee Sucks,'' and ''Shall I Compare?'' And the only word to describe both the songs and Dame Cleo's relaxed, insightful performances is triumphant.</p>
        <p>These numbers, along with Mr. Dankworth's Mozartian gloss, ''Turkish Delight,'' a showpiece for the tight skittering vocal harmonies between her voice and his reeds, occupy that slippery terrain where jazz meets art song. But as Dame Cleo performed them, the poetry, resting lightly on Mr. Dankworth's breezy melodies came alive. And the precisely pitched and timed coordination of Dame Cleo's voice and the reeds dazzled.</p>
        <p>Time seems almost to have stood still for Dame Cleo. In her early 70's she remains a double-barreled talent: a phenomenal technician whose coloratura embellishments occasionally soar above high C, and a theatrical interpreter who infuses lyrics with a calm overarching wisdom.</p>
        <p>By slowing up ''Tea for Two,'' and setting it to a slinky pop-jazz beat, she turned that Vincent Youmans ditty into a future honeymooner's playfully dreamy sexual invitation. Best of all was a luscious understated interpretation of that great autumnal ballad ''When the World Was Young,'' in which the singer's attitude of poised self-acceptance trumped any lurking self-pity.</p>
