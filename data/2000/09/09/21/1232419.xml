        <p>LUXEMBOURG: FUEL CONFERENCE  European Union transport ministers met for emergency talks to try to stop fuel price protests that have spread across the Continent in the past three weeks. The ministers were considering appealing to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to produce more oil. They were also considering making a call for a unified fuel tax.</p>

        <p>LUXEMBOURG: FUEL CONFERENCE  European Union transport ministers met for emergency talks to try to stop fuel price protests that have spread across the Continent in the past three weeks. The ministers were considering appealing to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to produce more oil. They were also considering making a call for a unified fuel tax.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: CONCORDE'S RETURN  France's civil aviation authority said it had granted clearance for an Air France Concorde that is stranded in New York to rejoin the rest of the company's fleet, grounded in France. After a Concorde crashed outside Paris on July 25, killing 113 people, authorities grounded the jets as a safety precaution. But before the plane can return, Air France must still get approval from countries the jet would fly over on its journey back.</p>

        <p>ITALY: INVESTIGATION IN SICILY  The police in Sicily arrested 16 businessmen as part of an inquiry into a suspected collusion between partners in a local business cooperative and the Mafia to secure public tenders illegally. Magistrates are also investigating two Sicilian politicians belonging to the local branch of the governing Democrats of the Left party in connection with the scheme.</p>

        <p>CANADA: FISHING ACCORD  Indian fishermen began removing lobster traps from New Brunswick's Miramichi Bay after agreeing to a deal to end a simmering dispute over fishing rights. The Mi'kmaq Indians from the Burnt Church band say they are fighting for their traditional right to harvest lobsters year-round, recognized in a Supreme Court ruling last year. The government maintains the ruling also reaffirmed its right to impose conservation measures in the area. Under the new agreement, federal fishery officers and native fishermen will gather to count lobster traps, and traps without tags from the Burnt Church reserve or the federal government will be removed.</p>

        <p>SIERRA LEONE: DELAY ON U.N. FORCE  The United Nations Security Council delayed until Dec. 31 enlarging the peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, now limited to 13,000 troops, because not enough soldiers have been pledged by member nations and because the United States is unlikely to get money from Congress to pay for its share of the bill until the end of the year. The Council plans to raise the number of peacekeepers to 20,500.</p>

        <p>BURUNDI: NO CEASE-FIRE  A summit meeting aimed at consolidating a fragile peace deal in Burundi ended in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, with no cease-fire accord but an appeal by mediators for all sides to cease hostilities. Although the mediator, Nelson Mandela, had persuaded most of Burundi's political parties to sign a peace deal last month, the two main armed Hutu rebel movements were not involved in talks until this week. A communique issued after the meeting, which included the presidents of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania, called for all sides to sign a cease-fire within 30 days.</p>

        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: GOVERNMENT ACCUSED ON AIDS  The head of the Anglican Church, Archbishop Njongonkulu Ndungane of Cape Town, said history would rank the lack of action against AIDS as ''as serious a crime against humanity as apartheid.''  President Thabo Mbeki and Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang insist that poverty and other diseases besides H.I.V. cause AIDS. Government figures show that a tenth of the population was infected with H.I.V. at the end of 1999.</p>

        <p>SOUTH KOREA: U.S. TROOPS TO STAY  President Kim Dae Jung and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen agreed that their nations must maintain a strong military alliance despite the easing of tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula. Currently there are 37,000 American troops stationed in the South. Meanwhile, Red Cross officials from both Koreas began talks to plan more reunions for families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>

        <p>MYANMAR: LAUREATE'S NEW TRAVEL PLAN  The pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will make another attempt to travel today, her National League for Democracy party said. The move is almost certain to provoke another confrontation with the military, which stopped the 55-year-old Nobel Peace laureate outside Yangon when she tried to leave last month and returned her home nine days later.</p>

        <p>JAPAN: BANKER COMMITS SUICIDE  The new president of Nippon Credit Bank, Tadayo Honma, 60, committed suicide in an Osaka hotel, the police said. Mr. Honma was appointed to revive the ailing bank on Sept. 1 in a deal to transfer it from the state to a consortium led by Softbank Corporation. The state took over the bank in 1998 after it collapsed because of bad loans.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: TALKS RESUME  After much indecision about whether peace talks would indeed be held or suspended, a senior Israeli and a senior Palestinian negotiator met in what the Israelis described as a ''businesslike'' session. On Tuesday, Mr. Barak had halted the talks scheduled for this week, only to renew his commitment to them by the evening.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: EPIDEMIC DECLARED  Health authorities declared West Nile virus infection an epidemic, saying the mosquito-borne illness has killed 13 people in Israel this summer and infected thousands more. The virus has been around in Israel for decades, but had not been seen in the Western Hemisphere until last year, when it killed seven people in New York City.</p>
