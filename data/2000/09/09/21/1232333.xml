        <p>Minijam, Innogear's Springboard module for Handspring's Visor, allows the handheld device to store and play MP3 files; also has an e-book reader and a picture viewer; photo (S)</p>

        <p>The promise of Handspring's Visor is its ability to easily morph into something other than the standard Palm device. To utilize the Springboard slot on the back of the unit, a developer could create a module that could turn the Visor into anything from a cell phone to a game player.</p>
        <p>One of the first of these Springboard modules is an MP3 player from Innogear called the Minijam, which was released last week. What is supposed to make Springboard modules so useful is that little needs to be done other than plugging them into the Springboard slot. While that is true of the Minijam -- it has some preloaded music covering most popular genres -- to take full advantage of it, MP3 files need to be downloaded to a computer and then copied to the Minijam. It is not a painful process, but you need to know the terminology and inner workings of the MP3 world. If you don't know about skins and rippers, some time spent reading MP3 FAQ's would be helpful to get the fullest enjoyment from the Minijam.</p>

        <p>One of the first of these Springboard modules is an MP3 player from Innogear called the Minijam, which was released last week. What is supposed to make Springboard modules so useful is that little needs to be done other than plugging them into the Springboard slot. While that is true of the Minijam -- it has some preloaded music covering most popular genres -- to take full advantage of it, MP3 files need to be downloaded to a computer and then copied to the Minijam. It is not a painful process, but you need to know the terminology and inner workings of the MP3 world. If you don't know about skins and rippers, some time spent reading MP3 FAQ's would be helpful to get the fullest enjoyment from the Minijam.</p>
        <p>The Minijam comes in two colors, graphite and ice, and two memory sizes, 32 and 64 megabytes.</p>
        <p>You can also buy memory cards to increase storage, up to 128 megabytes, which translates to about two hours of stored music. Since the cards are about the size of postage stamps and can be purchased separately, you can carry an entire music library around and not take up a lot of space.</p>
        <p>Although the main function of the Minijam is to play MP3 files, it also has an e-book reader from Peanut Press and a picture viewer from Album-to-Go. Books and photos can be stored on the Minijam and viewed through the Visor. There are also two megabytes of extra memory for moving any application or files off the Visor. For example, one popular entertainment guide takes up to 500 kilobytes of memory for each of the five cities currently available. Moving it to the Minijam leaves room for applications that are used more often.</p>
        <p>The 32-megabyte Minijam sells for $199; the 64-megabyte model is $259.</p>
