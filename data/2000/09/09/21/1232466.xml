        <p>According to the analysis, which is based on the Nielsen Hispanic Index, WABC's ''Eyewitness News'' had an estimated 253,000 viewers in that age group, WNBC's ''Newschannel 4 at 6'' had an estimated 193,000 of those viewers and WCBS's ''News 2 at 6'' had an estimated 65,000 viewers.</p>

        <p>The ratings mark the second time that WPIX has beaten all three major networks in the 18- to 49-year-old group, which is highly prized by advertisers.</p>

        <p>Correction:  September 27, 2000, Wednesday  A report in the Metro Business column on Thursday about the high ratings of Univision's Spanish-language newscast among viewers 18 to 49 years old misidentified the network's New York affiliate. It is WXTV, not WPIX.</p>
