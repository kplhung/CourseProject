        <p>I AM a big defender of the dress. Suffering from three children, a dog, two cats and a suicidal streak that prompted me to agree last week to become a class mother, I am grateful to any single article of clothing that takes less than 30 seconds to put on but is efficient enough to function as an entire outfit.</p>
        <p>Make that an entire identity. With a mere dress, you can transform yourself into a businesswoman, a carpooling mom, an Audrey Hepburn wannabe or a princess.</p>
        <p>Although I personally favor the royalty option (I like to wear bottle-green velvet and carry a scepter to Waldbaum's) I have found that owning just the right casual dress is more directly applicable to my lifestyle.</p>
        <p>But which dress is the right dress? I sought advice from Dr. Jane Hegland, an assistant professor of clothing, textiles and fashion merchandising at New Mexico State University.</p>
        <p>I figured that since her doctoral dissertation had explored the ritualistic aspects of dressing for the prom, she should have no trouble advising someone who just wanted an incentive to get out of pajamas on Monday.</p>
        <p>Early in the conversation, I established a baseline. ''I don't want the same one everyone else is wearing,'' I said.</p>
        <p>''Of course not,'' Dr. Hegland said. ''But getting dressed is a constant tension between conformity and individuality. You don't want to go too far to the edge and somehow communicate that you don't understand the rules, but you want to add your own individual flair.''</p>
        <p>We agreed that maybe what I wanted was a vintage dress, a well-sewn vestige of an earlier era that would clearly label me as an individual of superior taste. I wouldn't know a Bonnie Cashin coat from a turn-of-the century opera cloak. But thanks to a recent surge in the popularity of vintage clothing, I should have no trouble getting an education online, where a simple search for ''vintage clothing'' turned up 92,400 matches on the Google search engine.</p>
        <p>Considering that both Hollywood starlets and the woman sitting next to me at last week's PTA meeting are snagging vintage Pucci on e-Bay,  why shouldn't I get lucky, too?</p>
        <p>But when I found myself squinting dubiously at thumbnail photos of dresses like the ''late 1940's swing dress with ruffled collar and cuffs'' for sale for $22 at Vintagevixen.com, all I could think was, I'd look like Ma Walton in that.</p>
        <p>Then another source gave me a lead. ''Do you remember a dress, back in the 1970's -- it was universally flattering, it tied at the shoulder, with a band that went over the top of the bosom and then smocked under it?'' asked Christina Lindholm, a fashion historian who heads the department of fashion design and merchandising at Virginia Commonwealth University. ''I had one in navy.''</p>
        <p>Although my notes indicate that Ms. Lindholm continued to describe this once-popular style in great detail, the last words I heard clearly were ''universally flattering.'' It was vaguely familiar. Didn't my childhood neighbor, Mrs. Nilles, wear that dress to a block party when I was in junior high?</p>
        <p>It was a tantalizing enough lead to send me to a couple of dozen more online shops, with merchandise that ranged from vintage couture to frowsy flowered housedresses that even Ma Walton would have torn up to make cleaning rags.</p>
        <p>I was intrigued by items like the men's polyblend white disco shirt, $19.50 at Rustyzipper.com, the 1920's kidskin flapper shoes, $125 at Hemlockvintage.com, and the Dolce and Gabbana satin purse for $85 at Buffaloexchange.com. But no 1970's sundress that always came in a solid color, with three contrasting bands of color across the bottom and an applique of a lotus flower.</p>
        <p>Not everyone recalls that particular dress. As Anne Hollander, a dress historian and author of ''Feeding the Eye: Essays'' (Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux, 1999) told me: ''Universally flattering comes and goes.''</p>
        <p>That made me wonder whether the dress would look hopelessly dated even if I did find it. The problem, Ms. Hollander said, was that I wouldn't be able to examine it closely online, much less try it on.</p>
        <p>''I think buying vintage items online could really be a mistake,'' she said, ''because it's very hard to figure out the general flavor, how it well it wore,'' she said. ''If you are going to buy it online but can't touch it, then really look at the way the seams have worn and how the back looks.''</p>
        <p>As a last resort, I tried Fashiondig.com, which operates an online mall that has about a dozen vintage clothing shops. ''If you have a fashion dilemma to solve, just Ask Janet -- she may have the answer you are looking for,'' the site invited. So I clicked on Ask Janet and sent an e-mail message to the site's co-founder, Janet Pytowski.</p>
        <p>In less than a day, Ms. Pytowski responded: ''The dress you're describing was a comfortable, popular dress worn during the hippie era. The Young Edwardian label (they made reproduction Victorian clothes) made a version of this sundress. Sally Struthers wore it on 'All In the Family.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Pytowski, a video producer who has collected a library of fashion videos dating to 1984, suggested that I post a classified advertisement on the site's My Closet area. Placing an advertisement is currently free but will cost $4.95 a month beginning next month, she said.</p>
        <p>Did I want to look like Sally Struthers? Well, at least the actress wore it when she was playing Gloria Bunker Stivic, not when she was doing those television commercials for a list of mail-order technical schools that included both high-school equivalency studies and firearms repair.</p>
        <p>To place an advertisement, I had to specify an amount I would be willing to pay. ''With a one-of-a-kind piece of clothing, how do I know what it's worth?'' I asked Ms. Pytowski, stalling for time.</p>
        <p>''You have to decide what it's worth to you,' she said.</p>
        <p>Under ''price,'' I typed, ''Negotiable.''</p>
