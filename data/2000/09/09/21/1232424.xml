        <p>This town of 15,000 people gives many mixed messages to the brown-skinned men -- welcomed as workers but shunned as neighbors -- who line up in front of the 7-Eleven at a central intersection looking for day work.</p>
        <p>But there was nothing ambiguous about the message delivered Sunday night when  two white men picked up two laborers, took them to a secluded, abandoned factory in Shirley and then hit one in the back of the head with a crowbar and slashed the other's neck and wrists with a knife.</p>
        <p>The victims escaped, flagged a car on the nearby Long Island Expressway, received medical help and are expected to recover.</p>
        <p>The violence was hardly routine, but the situation is one faced across the region from  Brewster, N.Y., to Montclair, N.J., where poor Hispanic migrants, many of them undocumented workers, are increasingly conspicuous outsiders amid the affluent bustle of suburban life.</p>
        <p>Interviews with people here about the immigrants in town turned up no small amount of uneasiness and sometimes hostility, but there was more confusion and sympathy than anger.</p>
        <p>Of those people interviewed in the parking lot of the 7-Eleven or outside the boarded-up Bald Hill Market, where a vigil for the workers was held in the rain Tuesday night, most said that the workers were simply trying to earn a living and support their families.</p>
        <p>Most condemned the attack, while several struggled to resolve the current tensions that have torn the town apart.</p>
        <p>''When I heard about the migrant workers, and another incident of bias crime, I had a very nauseous feeling in my stomach,'' said Yolanda Lucas, a psychiatric rehabilitation worker who was waiting in a van in the parking lot yesterday.</p>
        <p>''They get in the car, trusting people,'' said Ms. Lucas, who is black. She advocated making it illegal to pick the workers up at the corner.</p>
        <p>But recognizing that the workers have to feed themselves as well, she suggested that the people who pick up the day workers should have to register or show their licenses before hiring anyone, ''so that people would know where they are.''</p>
        <p>A man who owns his own landscaping service but insisted on not being identified by name said he had hired a few immigrants.</p>
        <p>''As long as they're working, they're no problem,'' said the man, who lives in Holbrook but works in Farmingville. ''I can see if people in Farmingville believe that if they're not working they should go back home or to a factory and not mess up the look of Farmingville.''</p>
        <p>Jack Scheckner of Mount Sinai, who directed an English as a second language program for 22 years in Freeport, called the attack ''very cruel and vicious.''</p>
        <p>''I think it's a sin, a real shame, that these people be mistreated,'' he said. One solution, he said, would be a central place, other than a store's parking lot, where employers could find help without causing traffic problems.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scheckner would also like to see the government curb the number of immigrants. But he added, ''No one should rightfully take the law into their own hands and punish somebody just because they are different.''</p>
        <p>Local governments have tried several ways to regulate immigrants, first with a law limiting the number of tenants per apartment in the Town of Brookhaven, which includes Farmingville, and then with a proposed bill in the Suffolk County Legislature in support of filing a federal suit to force the Immigration and Naturalization Service to move against illegal immigrants.</p>
        <p>The bill, which failed to pass earlier this month, will not be reintroduced, its sponsor, Joseph Caracappa, a Republican County legislator from Selden, said through a spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Paul J. Tonna, the presiding officer of the Suffolk County Legislature, said he and his wife, Carol, had pledged $2,000 as a reward for information about the attack. Bill Fairchild of Crimestoppers of Suffolk County said his unit had received about 20 tips about the attack.</p>
        <p>A podiatrist from Farmingville, Bernadette Garcia, said she would volunteer if there was a hiring center  where immigrants could congregate and where employers could register for them. ''The problem lies with the employers,'' she said. ''The people who pick them up treat them like day slaves.''</p>
        <p>''They have to give back,'' she said of those who hire the workers. ''It's not fair for them to earn $50,000 for a job and give the migrant workers $25 a day. It's just not right. Somebody has to oversee it.''</p>
        <p>Hugh Duncan, an insurance agent and teacher in Farmingville, said Huntington had the right idea -- immigrant workers needing work there gather in a fenced-off lot that does not obstruct traffic. ''A lot of people who are complaining, they hire them,'' he said. ''They're hypocrites.''</p>
        <p>Outside the closed Bald Hill Market, Luisa Machado, an assistant manager at a liquor store, said workers should gather there to be hired. ''There is just so much hatred here, it's horrible,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''They're not hurting anybody,'' she said of the workers. She worries that there may have been earlier, more lethal attacks that no one heard about. ''I just hope they haven't done it to anyone else,'' she said of the attackers.</p>
        <p>Nearby, Chris Volpe, a retired law enforcement officer in Farmingville, said he wanted to move away from his town, where he is disturbed by seeing 35 men living in one house and where he does not like seeing 20 foreign-born people playing basketball at the nearby playground on weekends.</p>
        <p>''These people come here demanding protection, and they don't pay taxes,'' he said. ''I never see anybody harass the people. Nobody hates these people, because they're good people, God-fearing people. But what's happening is not natural. You cram 35 people into a house, and it's not a good thing. It's not a healthy thing.''</p>
        <p>Sal Lucchese of Ronkonkoma, who works for a propane company, was ordering some food at the Lucky Fortune Chinese Restaurant nearby. ''Send them back to their country,'' he said. ''These people come to this country illegally. People are taking advantage of them. They're lucky if they make minimum wage.''</p>
        <p>Sam Costanza, who works for the Long Island Rail Road and was picking up food at a local restaurant, said: ''I don't believe in violence in any way, shape or form. What did it prove? Did it scare anybody?''</p>
        <p>He added that he had seen men lined up for work again this morning.</p>
