        <p>YOU know they've gotten a BlackBerry when they stop calling.</p>
        <p>No matter that the tiny keyboard on the BlackBerry, a wireless e-mail device, requires a kind of thumb-typing nobody learned in high school. Or that reading messages on a pager-size screen while driving is a health hazard. For a fast-growing group of BlackBerry fans, getting and sending text messages while away from home and office beats verbal contact any day, all day.</p>
        <p>''It teaches you that most of the time on the phone is small talk,'' said Tom Scott, chairman of the Nantucket Nectars juice company, who like many recent BlackBerry converts said his phone bills had gone down. ''I don't like dealing with the cell phone. It always goes in and out. I'm always worrying that I'm getting cancer. And honestly sometimes I would just rather talk to less people than more people.''</p>
        <p>Members of the BlackBerry cult won't ask how you are in their electronic communiques. Nor are they very likely to give you their full attention when you are in their physical presence, since the messages flashing on their pager-size screens demand a quick glance, and perhaps a response. But they will return your e-mail almost immediately, no matter where they are.</p>
        <p>Which is more important?</p>
        <p>The answer may not matter. The BlackBerry is the forerunner of a set of tools that offer constant contact without the need to actually talk to anyone. About a million Americans use a wireless e-mail service, with BlackBerry leading the pack, according to the Yankee Group, of Boston, a telecommunications consulting firm.</p>
        <p>In recent months, the BlackBerry has become much coveted by America's business professionals, who are increasingly judged by how accessible they are to colleagues and clients. A key draw: unlike cellular phone calls, which require a clear distraction of attention, BlackBerrys allow users to do two things at once.</p>
        <p>Internet executives rave about watching messages roll in while they conduct other business. Along with higher salaries and concierge service, BlackBerrys headed a list of demands submitted by junior analysts at Salomon Smith Barney to their superiors last spring. Even lawyers, notoriously slow to embrace e-mail in the office, have become enthralled by the BlackBerry.</p>
        <p>''I've heard colleagues say that when they've had the poor taste to return e-mails from their bedrooms, it hasn't been a welcome gesture,'' said David Grais, a partner in the law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher in New York. ''It definitely makes you more of an e-mail junkie.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Grais uses his BlackBerry to receive messages when he's out of the office and when he's not. ''If I'm two floors away and I get a call, my secretary knows I can always be reached,'' he said. ''It's completely indispensable.''</p>
        <p>It is harder to see why ordinary consumers would crave such continuous connection, or be willing to pay for it. Research in Motion, or RIM, the Canadian company that makes the original BlackBerry models ($349 and $399) and a slightly larger version ($499), has marketed its $40-per-month e-mail service to corporations, and about 5,000 companies now pay for employees to use it.  Individuals can buy the BlackBerry online, and RIM said it would soon be available in retail stores like Staples. America Online has announced plans to make its e-mail and instant messaging service available through BlackBerry-like gadgets. And Earthlink, the nation's second-largest Internet service provider, is conducting a pilot test with BlackBerrys.</p>
        <p>''I can't tell you what motivates people to want e-mail on their hip when they leave home,'' said Roland Wilcox, a senior product manager at Earthlink. ''But they do, and we want to provide it to them.'</p>
        <p>The BlackBerry will soon face more competition, most notably from cellular phones, which allow users to talk and type messages with one device and are the mobile e-mail method of choice among Europeans and Japanese teenagers.</p>
        <p>Because the cellular network in the United States is a patchwork of often incompatible standards, the BlackBerry, which uses a wireless data network built for two-way messaging, has so far been able to provide better coverage and lower prices here than most phone services. But even as this country's wireless providers find ways to weave their networks together, it is unclear whether Americans will take to typing with the cell phone's number pad, which requires two presses of the 2 key to enter the letter B, for instance.</p>
        <p>The BlackBerry's QWERTY keyboard and its calendar and address book features have also pitted it against the wireless models of the Palm and the Handspring Visor personal digital assitants. The Palm and the Visor require users to log on to collect e-mail, while the BlackBerry receives e-mail automatically whenever it is on. And since the smaller version uses a AA battery that lasts about two weeks with continuous use, users tend to keep it turned on.</p>
        <p>The BlackBerry's biggest competition comes from Motorola, whose new T900 is a sort of stripped-down BlackBerry that is considerably less expensive. Last week, Motorola introduced the P935, a model aimed  at the BlackBerry's core corporate market.</p>
        <p>But for now, the BlackBerry is at the forefront of a shift in communications reminiscent of the introduction of the cellular phone in the early 1980's, except that it is happening much faster, and with an added dimension. Wireless e-mail changes the nature of e-mail itself, making for a shorter, jerkier exchange not unlike a typical cell phone call. But it also alters communication as a whole, because people can now choose to send e-mail all the time rather than call.</p>
        <p>More than perhaps any other electronic device, the BlackBerry also gives its users the sense of being in many places at once. Users say the ability to send e-mail while waiting in line for lunch, or eating it, is one of the BlackBerry's chief appeals. But for those not toting around a palm-size conduit to the rest of the world, it may seem like a drawback.</p>
        <p>Already, there is a BlackBerry backlash. The devices are banned at the staff meetings of Loudcloud, an Internet company based in Sunnyvale, Calif. ''Staff meetings are not worth holding if everybody is there thumb-typing,'' said Ben Horowitz, Loudcloud's chief executive.</p>
        <p>A vice president of a major investment bank, who declined to be identified, complained that colleagues at another bank were distracted by the devices.</p>
        <p>''You go to meetings and it's hard to get those guys to focus because they're all pecking away,'' he said. ''In a small enough meeting it becomes obtrusive if you're playing with it. If it's six or seven people, you can get away with it.''</p>
        <p>James Katz, a professor of communications at Rutgers University, recently saw a student scrolling through his BlackBerry messages in the back of a class he was teaching on telecommunications policy. It seemed apropos for Mr. Katz to send him a message with his own BlackBerry. But the professor said the incident reinforced a lesson borne out in his own research.</p>
        <p>''People are going to be spending more time in a mental space different than their body space,'' Mr. Katz said. ''You're able now to more subtly engage in these antisocial behaviors than you could before. And if you're not entertaining, people will tune you out for this other world.''</p>
        <p>Still, at a time when what Mr. Katz and his colleagues call ''perpetual contact'' is becoming a standard expectation, some BlackBerry aficionados say the device offers a more humane way to make it happen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scott, the juice company executive, recently needed to reach an employee who was taking a day off to attend a religious ceremony. ''I could've called his cell phone, but I didn't want to bother him,'' Mr. Scott said. ''With this thing you don't have to interrupt someone. They can wait five minutes or whatever it is and answer on their own time.''</p>
        <p>Hoai Ta, the senior director of information technology at Broadvision, a Silicon Valley company that offers BlackBerrys to all employees, said he took his with him even on weekend fishing trips.</p>
        <p>''Every so often I pull it out, to see, do I have a message from my boss?'' Mr. Ta said. ''Being in touch, staying on top of things is better for me. Otherwise I have to deal with the problem later on anyway, and there's the perception that you're not acting fast enough.''</p>
        <p>Not everybody considers that a good trade-off. Kim Smith, 32, said her fiance, Jonathan Guerster, an avid BlackBerry user, sometimes ''almost crashes when we're driving.''</p>
        <p>''There's definitely a lack-of-focus issue,'' she added. For instance, during conversations about getting married and buying a house, Mr. Guerster ''may from time to time decide to start doing e-mails,'' Ms. Smith said. ''It's annoying.''</p>
        <p>On the way to Nantucket, Mass., where the couple recently bought a house, Mr. Guerster sends e-mail from the nine-seater plane until the BlackBerry stops working. On the way back, he holds it in his lap waiting for his connection to click in, Ms. Smith said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Guerster, a venture capitalist, conceded a certain BlackBerry addiction, but he said the ability to send e-mail as thoughts popped into his head had made him more productive and more focused because he no longer had to keep lists in his head.</p>
        <p>Still, he said, he is glad the BlackBerry doesn't work on Nantucket. ''I like to be able to get out of range,'' he said.</p>
        <p>How long that will last, however, is unclear. Ms. Smith had heard that Mr. Scott, among others, had begun to petition RIM to extend its coverage area to the island. ''I hope it doesn't work,'' she said.</p>
