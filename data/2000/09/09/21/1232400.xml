        <p>George W. Bush has been trying mightily to present to the nation an image of a more diverse, more inclusive Republican Party. But it's not an easy sell because his is a party with more than its share of troglodytes.</p>
        <p>So this week, even as Mr. Bush was sending his own message by happily and comfortably kissing Oprah on the cheek, a pro-Republican television ad by an independent group in Missouri was featuring a white woman complaining that she had to ''act fast'' and get her son out of a public school that had ''a bit more diversity than he could handle.''</p>
        <p>The Associated Press noted that the ad is running in Kansas City, where a bitter battle over school desegregation is being fought.</p>
        <p>The ad maker tried to have it both ways by sending viewers a loud message that a vulnerable white youngster was being exposed to the danger of too much diversity, while at the same time insisting -- off-camera -- that the word ''diversity'' did not refer to anyone's ethnic background.</p>
        <p>I find that kind of not-so-subliminable poppycock to be rat funny.</p>
        <p>The 60-second ad was the work of a conservative commentator and activist named Richard Nadler, who created an independent group called the Republican Ideas Political Committee. His goal, Mr. Nadler told me in an interview, is to elect Republican candidates to office.</p>
        <p>The ad is narrated by a woman who says: ''Back in 1994, Ralph and I started an educational savings account for the kids. Our Julie attended public school. She was an honors student and the captain of the debate team. Our accounts helped put her through college.</p>
        <p>''But when Jason started hanging  with the wrong crowd, we had to act fast. We didn't want him where drugs and violence were fashionable. That was a bit more diversity than he could handle.''</p>
        <p>The woman emphasized the word ''diversity.'' She went on to say that she and her husband sent Jason to a private school ''where the moral expectations are higher.''</p>
        <p>Viewing the ad, it is very difficult to avoid the feeling that its real message is that school integration has gone too far.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nadler said the word ''diversity'' referred only to the drugs and violence mentioned in the narrator's previous sentence. I asked him why -- especially in the midst of a controversy over school integration -- he would choose to use that word in a context that, at best, would cause confusion.</p>
        <p>''Because,'' he said, ''being a conservative rather than a liberal I don't genuflect every time I hear 'diversity.' On the contrary, I think it's frequently used as a code word for lack of standards.''</p>
        <p>A description of the ad was contained in a front-page article in The Washington Post on Tuesday. The article infuriated Mr. Nadler. ''I woke up this morning,'' he said, ''and discovered I was the number one racist in the nation because some [expletive] at The Washington Post said I was.''</p>
        <p>For the record, The Washington Post did not accuse Mr. Nadler of being a racist. But a number of professional observers have found the ad to be problematic. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, said in the Associated Press article: ''Instead of making a case for parental choice it appears to make the case against diversity.''</p>
        <p>Whatever Mr. Nadler's motivations, his ad was potentially embarrassing to Mr. Bush and the national Republican Party. In addition to undermining Mr. Bush's efforts to promote diversity within the party, it comes just a week after it became widely known that the word ''rats,'' in large white capital letters, had been inserted into a Republican Party ad attacking Vice President Al Gore on the issue of prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush quickly disavowed Mr. Nadler's ads. Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Texas governor, said: ''We talked to the governor about that. His thought is that it is an inappropriate message and the ad should not air.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''We think that diversity is a strength of America's public school system. It's a strength of our country.''</p>
        <p>I called Mr. Nadler and asked if Governor Bush's objections would lead him to pull the ad. He said: ''Probably not. But we'll see.''</p>
