        <p>FIRST there was a twinge, then tightness, then a screaming, hot pain. Finally, Inger Miller had to face the moment of reckoning. She got down in the starting blocks last week and tried to burst out of them. She couldn't.</p>
        <p>How could fate be so cruel? Last Friday Miller told her coach, John Smith, that she would have to give up her spot in the Olympic 100 meters. Train for four years, wait for four years, and it comes down to this? Why here? Why now?</p>
        <p>''That's the thing,'' Miller said yesterday. ''These things aren't in your hands, you're not in control of this kind of stuff. That's what you have to contend with. And it's hard. You have these goals set, you know what you're capable of doing, you see the potential that you have. Then it doesn't come to fruition at the pinnacle of your career or of your season and that's the Olympics. It's difficult.''</p>
        <p>She was left to hope she could run in the 200 meters or the 4x100 relay later in the Olympics.</p>
        <p>Some disappointments take place in a great spotlight, on center stage. But most of the agony takes place in more anonymous corridors of Olympic venues.</p>
        <p>Here, a woman judo player writhed in agony in the hallway leading from the arena to the dressing rooms. Her wrist appeared to be broken and her shoulder was out of place.</p>
        <p>There, Karim Bare of Niger and Farkhod Oripov of Tajikistan came all the way to Australia to swim in one race. One heat with three competitors. On Tuesday they were disqualified for false starts. The person who did swim -- Eric Moussambani of Equatorial Guinea, who only began swimming competitively in January, barely finished and became an Olympic folk hero.</p>
        <p>Here we see disappointments come in bunches: two, three, four times a day. We celebrate the highs but the reality is that there are only three medals -- gold, silver and bronze. Everyone else is left to take comfort from being an Olympian, from coming close.</p>
        <p>In the course of a United States sports week, disappointment comes and goes. There's always the next game; there's usually a hefty check to deaden the pain.</p>
        <p>For Olympians, however, the Games represent one chance that must last until the next one rolls around in four years. And who knows what will happen in four years.</p>
        <p>Wednesday marked the fourth consecutive day I covered someone's upset, someone's frustration, someone's dream that was supposed to happen but didn't.</p>
        <p>On Sunday at the velodrome, Chris Witty attempted to become the second Olympian ever to medal in the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. She fell short.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Jimmy Pedro, the world judo champion at 73 kilograms (160.6 pounds), was the favorite to win the United States first Olympic gold medal in the sport. Pedro was knocked out of gold medal contention in his first match, then lost a chance for any medal at all. At the end of the day, Pedro was in tears. Why here. Why now?</p>
        <p>On Tuesday Jenny Thompson, so brilliant in relay races -- the only women to win seven gold medals in swimming -- was also in tears, after failing yet again to win her first individual medal. She finished fifth.</p>
        <p>Now on Wednesday, Inger Miller had to pull out of the 100 meters. Why here? Why now?</p>
        <p>Miller and Thompson offered similar observations about their disappointment.</p>
        <p>Thompson said, ''I have to remember that swimming is not the most important thing in the world.''</p>
        <p>Miller said: ''It really is not the end of the world. There's another Olympic Games and there's world championships next year.''</p>
        <p>If anyone knows how fragile an Olympic athlete's world is, it is Maurice Greene. Greene and Michael Johnson were primed for a 200-meter duel during the United States Olympic track trials. The race came off, but Greene and Johnson each were injured and failed to qualify for the 200 here. On Wednesday in a crowded news conference at the Sydney media center, Greene, the cocky 100-meter sprinter, stood on a podium with Ato Boldon, Jon Drummond and Curtis Johnson cracking jokes, making light of the pressure.</p>
        <p>Curtis Johnson, who finished second to Greene in the 100 at the trials, then distanced himself from the high-jinx. He said that Greene, for all his talk, was affected by his adversity at the trials.</p>
        <p>He said if you listened carefully to Greene, you would notice a change.</p>
        <p>''I think he realizes that nothing is guaranteed,'' Johnson said. ''That's why today he said, 'We'll see,' as opposed to 'I'm going to do this, do that, whatever.' ''</p>
        <p>On Wednesday Miller said her father, the former Olympic sprinter Lennox Miller, tried to find a way to comfort her. ''He said to me, 'I wish there was something I could say to you that would make it all better.' But there isn't. I have to go through my own disappointments.''</p>
        <p>Miller. Thompson. Witty. Pedro. They reinforce in dramatic ways what we already know: Dreams are so fragile. They also make the point that the key to surviving punctured hopes lies not so much in keeping dreams from falling apart, but in finding a way to put them back together after they shatter.</p>
