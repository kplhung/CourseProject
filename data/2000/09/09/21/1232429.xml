        <p>When the city, with no warning, canceled the food stamps of a 39-year-old Bronx father with AIDS in the summer, a lawyer tried two techniques to get the benefits restored: she wrote a letter to a top official at the Division of AIDS Services and Income Support, and she made a legal demand for a hearing on behalf of the man and his teenage son.</p>
        <p>The letter went unanswered, the lawyer, Cynthia Knox, recalled yesterday, and by the time of the scheduled hearing date, weeks later, the man had died of his disease, having had to fight in his final days for something as basic as food.</p>
        <p>This week, a federal judge ruled that the city ''chronically and systematically'' delayed and terminated benefits to thousands of people with AIDS, and he opened a new avenue of redress, placing the city's AIDS agency under federal authority for three years.</p>
        <p>No one knows exactly how the federal monitoring will work. The city, which is appealing the ruling, contends that the order is ''vague'' and ''confusing'' about the role of the federal magistrate judge appointed to oversee the city agency.</p>
        <p>But advocates like Ms. Knox, who testified during the bench trial in the class-action lawsuit -- Henrietta D. v. Giuliani -- say that federal oversight will bring swifter remedies to more AIDS clients, in part because the city will face stiff penalties if its agency remains unresponsive. And lawyers in other recent class-action lawsuits against the city's welfare operation say that monitoring by a federal court has sometimes been helpful in forcing the city to meet its legal obligations.</p>
        <p>Michael Hess, the city's corporation counsel, has criticized the decision, issued Tuesday by Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. of Federal District Court in Brooklyn. ''New York City provides more money and more services for AIDS-related people than any other city in the nation,'' Mr. Hess said.</p>
        <p>Leonard Koerner, the chief of appeals for the city's legal department, said that a conference would be needed ''to determine how the magistrate views her obligations under the opinion.'' He added, ''We believe that the opinion is vague as to the obligations that both parties have in front of the magistrate.''</p>
        <p>Cheryl L. Pollack, the federal magistrate judge appointed by Judge Johnson to oversee the city agency, declined through her law clerk to say how she planned to handle the task. But lawyers with experience in such cases said that typically a court-appointed overseer was instrumental in hammering out an agreement on what steps the city would take to fix the systemic problems, and how to verify that the rules were being followed by city caseworkers.</p>
        <p>''This is not rocket science,'' said Marc Cohan, director of litigation for the Welfare Law Center, which has been involved in three class-action lawsuits that won the appointment of special masters or other judicial oversight. ''What it requires is for the city to roll up its sleeves, give instructions to workers, put quality control and accountability in place: something the city is loath to do, particularly because it has a philosophy of deterrence and denial of benefits.''</p>
        <p>''The judge,'' Mr. Cohan added, ''was basically saying the law requires you to take certain steps, but you don't have procedures in place to do that.''</p>
        <p>Judge Johnson's decision is the latest in a series of cases in which lawyers for the poor have successfully argued in court that the Giuliani administration illegally denied benefits to those entitled to receive them. In Reynolds v. Giuliani, for example, a federal judge who found the city had illegally denied emergency food stamps and Medicaid to needy welfare applicants recently rejected the city's contention that the problem was fixed, and demanded better monitoring.</p>
        <p>In another case, Morel v. Giuliani, a special master required the city to put in place procedures to ensure that people continued to receive benefits until a ruling in a fair hearing. A fair hearing is a state-administered process required by law to give recipients of benefits a chance to contest the city's decision to cut them off.</p>
        <p>In the current case, the magistrate judge, in addition to levying fines and ordering fixes, may order any other creative sanction she chooses if she sees recurrent violations.</p>
        <p>AIDS organizations around the city will work out a method of categorizing complaints and funneling them through the plaintiffs' lawyers to Judge Pollack, said Armen Merjian, a staff lawyer for Housing Works, which brought the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>''One of the virtues of this decision is that the magistrate judge is empowered to hand out penalties, without the plaintiffs' lawyers having to go back to court to file a separate contempt motion,'' Mr. Merjian said.</p>
        <p>Steven Banks, deputy attorney in charge of the Legal Aid Society, has seen the limitations as well as the benefits of such sanctions, however. The city has paid more than $5 million in fines for leaving homeless families to sleep overnight in an office, for example, and has been found in contempt of court for failing to fix the problem. City officials in the Dinkins administration even faced a judge's order to spend the night in the office themselves -- with limited effect.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Banks said, ''as a practical matter, relief from the court becomes a reality for individual class members rather than just rights that remain on paper when you can seek a monitor's immediate intervention rather than having to go back to court.''</p>
