        <p>Indoor volleyball has changed dramatically since the last Summer Olympics. Sets are now played to 25 instead of 15, and a team can score on every exchange, not just when it is serving.

        <p>Indoor volleyball has changed dramatically since the last Summer Olympics. Sets are now played to 25 instead of 15, and a team can score on every exchange, not just when it is serving. A specialist defensive player, called a libero, is now part of the action and wears a different-colored shirt from his teammates.</p>
        <p>But one aspect of the game has remained the same since the last Olympics: the American men's team is struggling, and after this afternoon's 25-15, 25-20, 25-23 loss to Yugoslavia, its chances of reaching the quarterfinals are increasingly poor.</p>
        <p>''I'm probably more disappointed in me than I am in the team,'' said Coach Doug Beal, who also coached the 1984 Olympic team, which won the first of two consecutive gold medals. ''I just have to do a better job of getting them to believe in themselves.''</p>
        <p>The Americans are 0-3. They suffered a surprising loss to Argentina in their opening game and have lost, more predictably, to Russia and Yugoslavia. They have two games left, and if they are to reach the quarterfinals, they must win their remaining two preliminary games against South Korea, and much more dauntingly, Italy.</p>
        <p>They must then hope that Argentina, which is 2-1 after losing to Italy in straight sets today, loses its final two games against Russia and Yugoslavia. If and only if all that happens, the Americans will still be at the mercy of the tie-breaking system, which favors the team that has won the highest percentage of sets.</p>
        <p>The Yugoslavs, who were also 0-2 before today, were considerably sharper, particularly on defense and on attack from the outside. The Americans led, 21-20, in the final set shortly after a rare Yugoslav timeout. But at 23-23, Goran Vujevic's spike ricocheted off the American block and fell to the floor. On the next point, a spike by the American outside hitter, John Hyden, went long, and the Americans were 0-3.</p>
