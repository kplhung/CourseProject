        <p>''He makes things happen out there,'' Torres said of Scott Gomez after the Islanders skated to a 1-1 tie last night in an exhibition game with the defending Stanley Cup champions at Nassau Coliseum.

        <p>The rookie Raffi Torres was too busy concentrating on earning a spot on the Islanders to pay that much attention to the fellow across the ice wearing No. 23 for the New Jersey Devils. But for Torres, he was impossible to ignore.</p>
        <p>''He makes things happen out there,'' Torres said of Scott Gomez after the Islanders skated to a 1-1 tie last night in an exhibition game with the defending Stanley Cup champions at Nassau Coliseum. ''I watched him for two shifts, maybe. I'd like to think I could play like him. And that he's of Hispanic heritage makes watching him that much more fun, too.''</p>
        <p>Torres, the second pick in the 2000 entry draft, and Taylor Pyatt, a first-rounder from last year's draft, are looking to beat the odds in making the Islanders. Both are left wings on a team top-heavy with left wings with National Hockey League experience. This season, the Islanders do not have the luxury of allowing young players time to overcome their mistakes.</p>
        <p>''All you can do is try and work hard every day,'' said Torres, who had an assist on Zdenos Charas' game-tying goal 7 minutes 54 seconds into the third period as time ran out on a power play. ''It can be a little intimidating going out against the best players in the world, but once you're on the ice, it equals out.''</p>
        <p>The Devils, whose main focus in the preseason is remaining healthy, took a 1-0 lead on a power-play goal by Henrik Rehnberg at 10:42 of the first period off a pass from Patrik Elias.</p>
        <p>The Islanders, who were just 3 of 26 on the power play in two preseason losses, went 0 for 7 last night. Coach Butch Goring insists the special teams must improve if the team is to go anywhere this season.</p>
