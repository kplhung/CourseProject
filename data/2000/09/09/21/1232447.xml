        <p>When it was over, midfielder Tab Ramos, an original member of the MetroStars, sat at his stall in the team's Cotton Bowl locker room and just relaxed. Ramos did not seem all that excited about the team's qualifying for the Major League Soccer semifinals for the first time with tonight's 2-1 victory over the Dallas Burn.</p>
        <p>''I feel good, but really, after the type of regular season we had, we really expected to win this series,'' Ramos said after the MetroStars eliminated the Burn on the strength of two goals by forward Clint Mathis and a tenacious defense.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars advance to play either the Chicago Fire or New England Revolution, who play Friday night in Chicago. The semifinal series will probably open Tuesday -- in Chicago if the Fire wins, at Giants Stadium if the Revolution prevails.</p>
        <p>Mathis continued his torrid offensive work against Dallas. He scored a league-record five goals in his last visit here, and his two tonight gave Mathis nine goals against the Burn in four games as a MetroStar this season. He also had one for the Los Angeles Galaxy before being picked up by the MetroStars in the May dispersal draft.</p>
        <p>''They're just one of those teams where everything clicks for me,'' Mathis said.</p>
        <p>On Mathis's first goal, forward Adolfo Valencia controlled the ball in tight quarters and passed to Roy Myers, who quickly crossed it to the right to a charging Mathis. Not breaking stride, Mathis volleyed the ball past the diving goalkeeper Matt Jordan, just inside the left post.</p>
        <p>Mathis had another scoring chance in the 77th minute; he broke free, but Jordan stuffed him.</p>
        <p>Jordan was not as lucky three minutes later. Mathis took a perfect lead pass from Valencia, and his left-footed kick was blocked by Jordan. But the ball bounded back off Mathis's chest, and he put it past Jordan.</p>
        <p>''Teams are so concerned about Adolfo that it has created a lot of chances for Clint,'' MetroStars Coach Octavio Zambrano said. ''But to his credit, he is a great finisher. If he gets the chance, he usually finishes it.''</p>
        <p>The second goal seemed to assure the MetroStars of victory. But the Burn got a break when MetroStars defender Mark Semioli was called for a penalty against midfielder Antonio Martinez. That set up a penalty kick, and forward Ariel Graziani easily hit the net's right corner past the diving Paul Grafer.</p>
        <p>About 11 minutes were left to play, counting injury time, but Dallas never threatened again.</p>
        <p>Grafer, recently promoted from the Long Island Rough Riders, won his second straight playoff game as a MetroStar, by identical scores.</p>
        <p>Tonight he twice made exceptional stops against midfielder Jason Kreis. The first, on a header, came in the 62nd minute, when Grafer deflected the ball over the crossbar. In the 80th minute, Grafer dived to his left to keep Kreis from scoring.</p>
        <p>''I haven't had much time to think about it, because things have been happening so fast for me,'' Grafer said. ''But when I do think about it, it's been a surreal experience for me. Right now, though, I'm just trying to concentrate on playing the best I can.''</p>
        <p>The last time these teams met here, it was a 10-goal game. But tonight, defense prevailed.</p>
        <p>''We've been playing total team defense for the last few weeks,'' defender Mike Petke said. ''Not just the defenders back there.</p>
        <p>''Everybody. And you can see the difference it's made.''</p>
        <p>The MetroStars got the game's first scoring chance, but midfielder Mark Chung's left-footed shot in the fourth minute was deflected by Jordan as it rocketed toward the net.</p>
        <p>A minute later, Myers lost a shoe in an exchange near the MetroStars' net. Then he was carried off on a stretcher in the 10th minute after a collision with a Dallas player, his left leg strapped down. Almost as soon as he reached the sideline, though, Myers was testing the leg. Soon he was back in the game.</p>
        <p>For about a 15-minute stretch, starting in the 14th minute, Dallas kept the offensive pressure on the MetroStars. As the ball stayed mostly in the Burn's scoring zone, one attempt after another was denied. Some luck was involved. Forward Aleksey Korol got underneath his open shot from about 18 feet and watched it sail into the stands.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars then began to neutralize the Dallas offense, even exerting some offensive pressure. Defender Steve Jolley was just high with a shot in the 31st minute.</p>
        <p>''We sometimes make things too hard,'' Zambrano said. ''If we had played as well in the first half, we probably would not have had as tough a time.''</p>
