        <p>Henry Threadgill is a powerful composer and uses the brute force of instrumentation to turn his music in different directions. And each time he changes direction, he retains the best ideas of his last band.</p>
        <p>In the early 80's with his seven-piece band that he called the Sextett, he used cello, trombone and two drummers to intimate both early jazz and chamber music. In the early 90's with Very Very Circus, he banished the string bass, doubled up on tubas as well as drums and added an electric guitar to give the music's crosshatched lines more bite. In the mid-90's with Make a Move, he kept tuba and guitar but added accordion and harmonium to make slower, more dolorous music.</p>

        <p>Henry Threadgill is a powerful composer and uses the brute force of instrumentation to turn his music in different directions. And each time he changes direction, he retains the best ideas of his last band.</p>
        <p>In the early 80's with his seven-piece band that he called the Sextett, he used cello, trombone and two drummers to intimate both early jazz and chamber music. In the early 90's with Very Very Circus, he banished the string bass, doubled up on tubas as well as drums and added an electric guitar to give the music's crosshatched lines more bite. In the mid-90's with Make a Move, he kept tuba and guitar but added accordion and harmonium to make slower, more dolorous music.</p>
        <p>He presented his new band, Zooid, in its premiere at the Knitting Factory on Friday night, and there was not quite as much of a stylistic leap as he has conditioned us to. The new instrument in this sextet is the oud, played by Tariq Benbrahim. He used it almost as a rhythm-section instrument: he repeated needling riffs that anchored the pieces, sometimes in tandem with the acoustic guitar of Liberty Ellman.</p>
        <p>The accordion, played by Tony Cedras, and the tuba, played by Jose Davilla, were still in place; those elements and the replacement of an electric guitar with an acoustic gave the music an early-20th-century flavor, somewhere around Kurt Weill, tango and marches.</p>
        <p>There was a cropped feeling to the music: the musicians were given short lines, and the music was at least two-thirds composed. But underneath all the Europeanisms is an interpretation of American funk. Somewhere in an omnivorous career, Mr. Threadgill has learned James Brown's orchestral trick of having each musician contribute in a small way to a cooperative rhythm, with pockets of space among the mesh of parts.</p>
        <p>Zooid's pieces, I'm happy to say, are a good deal shorter than those of Make a Move, and they're restless, of indeterminate key. Each piece fooled the ear many times as oud, guitar, accordion and Mr. Threadgill's flute or saxophone -- all playing lines -- seemed about to settle into lovely euphony, only to move on to more irresolution after a bare second of agreement. The musicians kept joining together though at specific moments in the compositions; this gave the music a sweet-and-sour flavor.</p>
        <p>The addition of the oud is the major textural change in this band, but it was hard to hear because of Friday night's mix. Though Mr. Threadgill's new drummer, Dafnis Pietro, executed his tricky rhythmic assignments beautifully, the other players still seemed a bit uncomfortable with the new music. Mr. Threadgill's chord changes are unusual, and there is a great, swelling drama in his work that asks improvisers to rise to the occasion and be expressive. (The composer, on alto saxophone, is an exemplary soloist for his own music: concise, witty and able to manage his improvisations so they slowly grow in urgency.)</p>
        <p>Everything wasn't quite coming together the first time out, but the little-known Mr. Ellman and Mr. Pietro, in time, could make this music grow.</p>
