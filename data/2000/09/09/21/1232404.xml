        <p>ANN RICHARDS, the former governor of Texas, tells a revealing story about running for re-election against George W. Bush in 1994. He had accused her of being soft on crime because she supported probation for nonviolent  small-time offenders (to make room in prisons for violent felons). So she worked hard to prove her toughness.</p>
        <p>She lost anyway, for many reasons, and has since turned philosophical. ''Everybody assumes George Bush is going to be tough on criminals; I have to prove that I'm going to be tough,'' said Ms. Richards, quoted in ''Madam President,'' by Eleanor Clift and Tom Brazaitis (Scribner, 2000). ''You see the difference?''</p>
        <p>Yes, there is a big difference. The former governor's remarks are about the double standards of politics, and there happen to be many of them. They are a part of political life. Big time, as Dick Cheney might put it. Because they exist big time in American life, and politics is anything but isolated.</p>
        <p>So women, presumed concerned about the ''soft'' issues of children, education and welfare, have to prove their bona fides on crime and the military. Men, presumed good on those guy issues, have to prove they can be sensitive. If women in politics have children, they'd better show they aren't shortchanging them for their career. Is there a man in politics who has had to prove his job doesn't interfere with parenting?</p>
        <p>It doesn't stop there. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman has to convince non-Jewish voters that he can be fair about the Mideast; traditionally liberal minority candidates have to prove they care about crime. Men can't sound weak or indecisive. Women can't seem overly aggressive.</p>
        <p>And a man running against a woman can't step over the invisible line separating assertiveness from hostility. Which brings us to Representative Rick A. Lazio, who has been criticized for being a bit nasty to Hillary Rodham Clinton in last week's Senate debate. He's the victim of sexism, of a double standard, he has since complained.</p>
        <p>''You can't make a point forcefully if you're a man and the person you are making a point with is a woman,'' he said on Tuesday. ''I just think that that's sexist.''</p>
        <p>Yes it is; Mr. Lazio should be able to treat a woman just as he'd treat a man who was opposing him. Of course some say he was the one being sexist, and that he would never have confronted an assertive male opponent as he did Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>That is how it is and how it will be until more women get into politics and the public gets used to it. But we are not there yet. So both Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton have to tolerate the indignities of unfairness, just as everybody else does.</p>
        <p>The most intriguing insight to emerge from last week's debate is not that we live with double standards, but that Mr. Lazio doesn't accept the rules of engagement. Problem is, the public does. And he has to get his votes from the public.</p>
        <p>THE public is made up of people like Sondra Mitchell, of Oakdale on Long Island, who talked about the Senate race last night as she waited for a train in Pennsylvania Station. She'd been undecided, she said. But then she started to think that Mr. Lazio was too conservative. ''And I also did not like the way he attacked her with the paper in the debate.''</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Walsh of Huntington disagreed. ''I'm a female and I do not think he was bullying her,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But a new New York Times/CBS News Poll of 1,066 likely voters, conducted from Sept. 14 (the day after the debate) through Sept. 19, clearly reflected disapproval of Mr. Lazio among suburban women. Mrs. Clinton had a 9-point margin (48 to 39), with 12 percent undecided. That makes it a very close race, since historically, most of the undecided voters go the challenger, and campaigns become increasingly volatile as Election Day approaches.</p>
        <p>We do know that many of those polled were critical of Mr. Lazio's negativity, especially suburban women. Mrs. Clinton drew 11 points more from the suburbs -- Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland -- than she did in a June poll, with most of the increase coming from women.</p>
        <p>In the current poll, Mr. Lazio gets 48 percent of the suburban vote, to 43 percent for Mrs. Clinton. But among suburban women, she got 54 percent to Mr. Lazio's 38 percent. In June Mr. Lazio drew 50 percent of the suburban vote to Mrs. Clinton's 32 percent; among suburban women, it was 43 percent for him to 36 percent for her.</p>
        <p>So, many women seem to be saying they do not like to see a woman subjected to rough-and-tumble campaigning. ''We ought to be held to the same standard,'' said Mr. Lazio, who may be learning that candidates play by rules the public writes.</p>
