        <p>THE superhero sits brooding and unshaven in a musty armchair, his costume in tatters, his great muscles sagging, his spirit lost to despair. Many a time he has been recruited for computer and video games. And on many of those occasions, the game in which he was to appear vanished before the curtain rose. It is his history. It is his curse.</p>
        <p>This character and his brethren  should be perfect material for electronic games, but the superhero genre has a troubled legacy. The computer games that died on the vine include Superhero, from Psygnosis; Champions, from Hero Software; Guardians: Agents of Justice, from MicroProse; and The Indestructibles, from Bullfrog. And when superheroes do surface, typically on video game consoles and using comic-book characters, they appear in fighting games that rarely do justice to the earthly complexities of being a demigod.</p>

        <p>THE superhero sits brooding and unshaven in a musty armchair, his costume in tatters, his great muscles sagging, his spirit lost to despair. Many a time he has been recruited for computer and video games. And on many of those occasions, the game in which he was to appear vanished before the curtain rose. It is his history. It is his curse.</p>
        <p>This character and his brethren  should be perfect material for electronic games, but the superhero genre has a troubled legacy. The computer games that died on the vine include Superhero, from Psygnosis; Champions, from Hero Software; Guardians: Agents of Justice, from MicroProse; and The Indestructibles, from Bullfrog. And when superheroes do surface, typically on video game consoles and using comic-book characters, they appear in fighting games that rarely do justice to the earthly complexities of being a demigod.</p>
        <p>Game makers seem undeterred by the high failure rate. Infogrames recently announced plans for a Superman game, and Irrational Games is working on Freedom Force for release next year.</p>
        <p>Leading the charge with an exuberant yell is Activision's Spider-Man for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64. This novel action game from Neversoft (the developer of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater) offers challenge, charm, humor and an unusually open vision of how a character moves through a game world.</p>
        <p>In most games, movement is limited: you can go only where the game designers allow you to go. But such limits, though necessary, can leave the player feeling that a location doesn't derive from the real world but has been tailored specifically to serve as an obstacle.</p>
        <p>I rarely had that feeling in Spider-Man. It is the least fettered of games. The world is your oyster. No rooftop is so high, no ledge so distant, no section of pipe so out of the way that you cannot reach it. Spider-Man jumps and swings across vast abysses, crawls on walls and ceilings in 34 levels set indoors and out-of-doors -- the latter a misty sea of Manhattan rooftops and cranes that recalls the classic game Killing Cloud. In my game, Spidey was even able to take refuge in a building under construction by nestling, upside-down, at the junction of two girders as bullets from a marauding helicopter rained on the other side. It was strangely satisfying.</p>
        <p>The only limits are his health, his supply of webbing and, occasionally, a meter at the top of the screen that measures the progress of the villain he is tracking. (More than once, I also wound up getting tangled in rooftop TV antennas, which made me feel more like one of the superhero wannabes from the movie  ''Mystery Men'' than the real thing.) To be sure, the levels are populated with enemies who can be caught in Spidey's web or punched and kicked into submission, but in many levels that's necessary only if you make a pit stop to collect supplies.</p>
        <p>You usually won't have much time to enjoy the scenery. The game hits its stride early on with a run of kinetic levels: an invigorating climb up the outside of a condemned skyscraper, a brisk pursuit of a taunting supervillain and a series of rooftop dashes to escape the police. (While Superman and Batman typically enjoy alliances with law enforcement, Spider-Man is often on the outs. Here, he's been framed for a theft.)</p>
        <p>Delightfully, this openness of structure survives into the early confrontations with ''bosses,'' the supervillains that Spider-Man faces at the end of each of the game's six chapters. In most games, each boss has an Achilles heel that the player must first identify and then batter at every opportunity. But in Spider-Man, the villains have inflexible styles of attack that can be turned against them. For instance, Rhino has a devastating charge, but only a limited ability to redirect it once he's moving, and a battleground laden with electrical transformers and explosive barrels calls for finesse.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Spider-Man is endearingly faithful to the comic books and cartoons that helped inspire the game. It swears its allegiance in the watercolorlike backdrops, the character voices (many provided by graduates of Spider-Man cartoons), the picture-perfect comic-book covers that grace each of the six chapters, and the spider symbol that heralds new scenes. (The game also raises the same question in my mind as the cartoons: Given that Spider-Man is traveling across the top of New York City, where he is finding an anchor for those sustaining threads he launches skyward as he swings from building to building?)</p>
        <p>Also authentic, and delightful, is the game's simple but robust sense of humor. Everyone's a comedian, and the sense throughout is that Manhattan is just a lavish playground for the entertainment of superhero and supervillain alike. Especially fun are the sequences involving a toothy enemy named Venom, who calls the hero Spider-Wuss. One of his attacks is a bear hug. (Spider-Man suggests a breath mint.) And while I'm not a fan of non-interactive animations -- on the principle that games shouldn't take control away from the player -- one such animation midway through their first meeting is a classic of its type. Venom escapes by breaking through the glass wall of an apartment building. The player can't see much of what follows within but can hear the combatants' crashing progress.</p>
        <p>''Ooo, toe, toe, toe, ow!'' Spidey says, moaning. A door crashes open, and a woman shrieks. ''Sorry, lady,'' Venom rumbles. ''Didn't see a thing.'' Then they burst out of the other side of the building and back into the fray. I was laughing so hard I dropped the controller.</p>
        <p>The controls may initially seem elaborate, with combinations of buttons allowing Spider-Man to perform special maneuvers, like creating ''Web spikes'' that add power to his punches or singling out specific locations for his sticky threads. But they are introduced gradually, and by the time you have to use them, you have probably learned how.</p>
        <p>If I have a complaint, it is the game's inconsistency. At one point, the game goes underground and exchanges some of its novelty for action-game conventions. There is a fighting level: Spidey has to hold off a horde of reptilian attackers atop a speeding subway train. There are at least a couple of Tomb Raider-like levels, with much running and throwing of switches. There is also a puzzle and a maze with a villain's lair at the end. These are not bad designs, and the action-oriented puzzle in the lair is especially grueling, but they don't fully capitalize on Spider-Man's special abilities. Lara Croft could perform many of these tasks as easily as Spider-Man.</p>
        <p>But this game is such an advance from its predecessors that this shortcoming seems little more than a hiccup. Spider-Man is the first good superhero game I've played in a decade. It might even be the first great one and could educate developers in what a superhero game could and should be.</p>
        <p>It should also banish any notion of a curse. Our down-and-out superhero is back in action -- hitting the  weights, bending over a sewing machine to mend his costume and airing out that musty armchair.</p>
        <p>In his eyes, a gleam of hope.</p>
        <p>Spider-Man, from Activision; developed by Neversoft for Sony PlayStation, $39.99; and developed by Edge of Reality for Nintendo 64, available during the holidays for $49.99; for all ages.</p>
