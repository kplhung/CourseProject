        <p>IT started optimistically enough: find Olympics Web sites that appeal to children and are as exciting as watching Marion Jones run the 100 meters. But Olympic endeavors can have many a slip. Like the Russian gymnast who went whirling off his pommel horse on Saturday  during a preliminary competition, the online sites are often disjointed and perform below expectations.</p>
        <p>A dream Olympic site should probably include a map of Australia, the history of the Olympics, profiles of athletes, event schedules, explanations of the sports and motivational bits about what it takes to be the best in the world. Sites should also offer more than an encyclopedia or book on the Olympics can -- they should be interactive in a meaningful way.</p>

        <p>IT started optimistically enough: find Olympics Web sites that appeal to children and are as exciting as watching Marion Jones run the 100 meters. But Olympic endeavors can have many a slip. Like the Russian gymnast who went whirling off his pommel horse on Saturday  during a preliminary competition, the online sites are often disjointed and perform below expectations.</p>
        <p>A dream Olympic site should probably include a map of Australia, the history of the Olympics, profiles of athletes, event schedules, explanations of the sports and motivational bits about what it takes to be the best in the world. Sites should also offer more than an encyclopedia or book on the Olympics can -- they should be interactive in a meaningful way.</p>
        <p>The first and most obvious stop was the children's section of the official site of the Sydney 2000 games, www.olympics.com/eng/kids. The site is studded with advertisements and animations that make the content seem almost like an afterthought. It is organized into four groups: sportzone, worldzone, greenzone and technozone, which offer virtual games and information with educational themes about sports, world culture, ecology and the technology behind the games.</p>
        <p>Millie the echidna, Olly the kookaburra and Syd the platypus, the Olympic mascots (what would the  games be without mascots?) are prominently featured.</p>
        <p>Especially intriguing are greenzone, which has a section on the Olympic-size mound of garbage generated by the games, and technozone, which asks older children to research and design their own venues for the sports they choose.</p>
        <p>The sportzone includes the Kids' Guide to Sports, which is both appealing and useful. The swimming link, for example, features an animated platypus swimming freestyle and a simple, easy-to-read explanation of the sport itself. There are also links to more information, like the rules. Sportzone is appealing to younger children, but it is also cluttered with advertisements.</p>
        <p>Sportzone, and the rest of the official site, is also packed with virtual games. The game at the swimming link requires players to beat the clock to dress a cyclist, an equestrian and a hockey goalie in the proper gear. There is also a trivia quiz.</p>
        <p>While the official site is amusing, animated and informative, to get to the basics, such as a history of the Olympics and maps, it's easier to go somewhere where they are clearly marked on the home page.</p>
        <p>That is what you will find at the Copernicus Educational Gateway to the summer games (www.edgate .com/summergames/inactive). There are sections on Olympic history and facts about Australia, and interviews with athletes.</p>
        <p>Copernicus is offered by the Learning Network, an educational company. The Copernicus site, while well researched and free of direct advertising (though sponsorship is prominent), is not as exciting as that animated swimming platypus.</p>
        <p>A less cluttered Olympic site is provided by the educational publisher Scholastic (www.scholastic.com /olympicgames). The site includes an interactive world map with pop-up boxes studded with Olympic facts about each country. While the map is entertaining, country names are not indicated unless you actually click on the country, and the facts about each country often seem relentlessly negative or trivial. Children can discover which country boycotted which games and why, or learn that the Irish Republican Army once caused a bicycle race pile-up.</p>
        <p>Scholastic also offers a Pen Pals Down Under feature that allows correspondence with Australian students. In an audio greeting, one Australian student admonished Americans ''not to win too many medals.''</p>
        <p>No Olympic tour on the Internet would be complete without a stop at the television sites. The CBS Kids' Zone (olympics.sportsline.com/u /kids/olympics/2000/index.html) has scanty offerings. It has an interactive game called Grab the Gold, interviews and sports facts. The information is suited to the youngest Olympic fans.</p>
        <p>NBC, the network that spent $704 million to broadcast the summer games, uses its space on the Web, naturally, to promote itself at www.nbcolympics.com/kids/index .html. It also promotes the ''Scholastic at the Olympic Games'' television show. Most of the educational content for children on the NBC site is provided by Scholastic.</p>
        <p>There are also plenty of interactive games, and just like the real thing, they come courtesy of sponsors. Children (or adults) can play the I.B.M. Basketball One on One game, the Visa Long Jump game and the Budweiser Boxing Battle.</p>
