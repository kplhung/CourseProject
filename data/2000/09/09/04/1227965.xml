        <p>The WorldCom Corporation is in advanced talks to acquire Intermedia Communications Inc., a telecommunications operator, for almost $3 billion in cash and stock, executives close to the negotiations said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Intermedia, based in Tampa, Fla., has been an extremely attractive takeover target because it has a 54 percent stake in Digex Inc., a so-called Web hosting company, which provides storage for corporate Web sites, monitoring their performance and providing Internet connections. It is viewed as the crown jewel of Intermedia, which sells basic phone services to businesses and government agencies and basic Internet connections.</p>
        <p>According to executives close to the deal, WorldCom entered negotiations with Intermedia last week after talks between Intermedia and Global Crossing, the telecommunications company based in Hamilton, Bermuda, broke down. A third suitor, Exodus Communications Inc., offered to acquire Digex, based in Beltsville, Md., directly for close to $8.5 billion in stock but was rebuffed by Intermedia.</p>
        <p>In July, Intermedia, based in Tampa, Fla., put its Digex stake, which it paid $150 million in cash for in July 1997, up for sale.</p>
        <p>According to the executives, WorldCom is negotiating to pay about $39 a share for Intermedia and take on nearly $3 billion in Intermedia's debt. That would represent about a 70 percent premium to Intermedia's closing price on Friday of $22.88.</p>
        <p>The executives cautioned that the deal could still fall apart and that Digex could quash the deal.</p>
        <p>A purchase of Intermedia would be WorldCom's first significant deal since its proposed merger with the Sprint Corporation collapsed because of opposition from antitrust regulators. WorldCom controls UUNet, an Internet backbone, and has Web hosting services, but acquiring Digex would allow it to expand its operations in Web hosting, which is becoming an increasingly competitive business.</p>
