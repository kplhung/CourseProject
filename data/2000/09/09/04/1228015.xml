        <p>Trying to end questions about his willingness to debate and to turn the tables on his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush today announced a schedule of three hand-picked debates that he would do, only one of which is guaranteed to be broadcast on the three major networks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush pointedly challenged Vice President Al Gore to meet him on these chosen dates and terms, with the first debate on Sept. 12. And he tried to turn Mr. Gore's response into a referendum on the vice president's credibility.</p>
        <p>''My opponent has said he will debate anytime, anywhere, and he has already accepted the debates that I am accepting today,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It's important for the American people to be able to trust the next president to keep his commitments, and therefore I take Al Gore at his word that he will be there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's proposal was a rebuff to the Commission on Presidential Debates, which was created by both parties and has supervised the presidential debates since 1988. That agency had proposed three debates, all to be broadcast on the major networks, a plan Mr. Gore has accepted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who made his announcement at a hastily called news conference on the lawn of the governor's mansion this afternoon, said he would debate Mr. Gore on a prime-time edition of NBC's ''Meet the Press'' on Sept. 12, on ''Larry King Live'' on CNN on Oct. 3, and in St. Louis on Oct. 17. The last debate, at Washington University, was the only presidential commission debate accepted by Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The talk-show debates would last 60 minutes each, compared with 90 minutes for the commission debates.</p>
        <p>At his news conference, Mr. Bush played video clips of Mr. Gore in appearances with Tim Russert on ''Meet the Press'' in July and on ''Larry King Live'' in March in which he said he would be happy to appear in debates on their shows. As the videos played, Mr. Bush stood at a lectern tapping his foot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who learned of Mr. Bush's offer at a campaign appearance in Philadelphia, instantly rejected it. His aides said that the commission debates were the only ones likely to be carried by all the major television networks and seen by the broadest television audience possible.</p>
        <p>Another Gore aide said that Mr. Gore would agree to the CNN and NBC sessions -- but only if he also agreed to the three commission debates. ''We've already accepted these,'' Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman, said of Mr. Bush's CNN and NBC debates. ''We have no problem with these. We just want to make sure we do the three presidential ones.''</p>
        <p>While the day's posturing was ostensibly over debates, it was also an attempt by both campaigns to make a statement about the opponent's character.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides have been suggesting that Mr. Bush is afraid of a prime-time confrontation, raising the question of whether he is up to the presidency. Mr. Bush was trying to plant the idea today that Mr. Gore is not a man of his word.</p>
        <p>Gore aides also said that Mr. Bush was deliberately trying to shrink the audience because unless there was blanket coverage, viewers would likely stray to other programming.</p>
        <p>''Unless these debates are road-blocked, you don't get the kind of viewership you do with the commission debates,'' said one aide, noting that Mr. Bush's proposal for the NBC debate would bump up against popular shows like ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and ''NYPD Blue.''</p>
        <p>It was not clear how much exposure the noncommission debates proposed by Mr. Bush would get. Donald L. Evans, Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, said that NBC and CNN had offered to make their videotape available to other networks.</p>
        <p>An official of another network said it was ''highly unlikely'' any network would broadcast a full debate that carried the branding and identity of a competing news organization.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for CBS News, Sandy Genelius, declined to say if the network would broadcast a ''Larry King Live'' debate. ''The candidates are obviously wrestling with how to serve the American public, and once they work that out, we'll then figure out how we can best serve the American public,'' Ms. Genelius said.</p>
        <p>Asked about the Gore campaign's reaction to Mr. Bush's debate proposal, Karen P. Hughes, his director of communications, said, ''We'll be there and we'll see if Al Gore will keep his word.'' She added, ''After eight years of prevaricating, after eight years of 'no controlling legal authority' and of debate over what the meaning of 'is' is, the American people deserve a president who will keep his word.'' Ms. Hughes said she saw no reason why the networks would not agree to broadcast all three debates as a public service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who was beginning a 24-hour Labor Day tour in Philadelphia, said, ''I'm very disappointed in this reaction because what's needed is to respect the rights of the American people, to see the debates on all the networks in prime time.''</p>
        <p>Of the commission debates, Mr. Gore said: ''It is a bipartisan, nonpartisan tradition, and it's not about Governor Bush, it's not about me, it's about the American people and giving the American people the chance they deserve to make an informed judgment as to who they want to be the next president.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides replied that President Clinton had rejected some of the commission's proposals in 1996.</p>
        <p>On Monday, The New York Times reported that Bush aides were resisting the commission, because they did not want to commit to three sessions broadcast in prime time on the three major networks. But the next morning, Mr. Bush told reporters that he was not afraid of prime time. ''I want as many people to watch our debates as possible,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the case of the one commission debate that Mr. Bush accepted, it was not clear what the format would be. Mr. Evans said that still had to be negotiated and that all the campaign had accepted was the St. Louis site.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush today also said his campaign would agree to two vice-presidential debates, one in Winston-Salem, N.C., sponsored by the debate commission and another one in a forum yet to be decided.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is generally considered  by political strategists to be a weaker debater than Mr. Gore and his aides had been angling for different formats. On Friday commission officials told aides to Mr. Bush that they would not revise the locations of schedules for the forums because the work was too far advanced.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he had selected the three formats because they would be varied and because he wanted one debate on the West Coast. ''This will give the American people an opportunity to see the candidates in a wide range of locations and formats,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As the debate over debates has simmered, Mr. Bush has appeared on the defensive, looking like he was seeking a better format for himself. He and his aides were clearly trying to turn the tables and use the struggle over debates to go after Mr. Gore's character and make him look untrustworthy. After Mr. Bush's news conference, Ms. Hughes reminded reporters that Mr. Gore had said he would debate anytime and anywhere. ''We take him at his word,'' she said.</p>
        <p>And on CNN, before Mr. Bush's news conference, Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, also noted that the vice president had been accepting numerous debate offers. Mr. Fleischer said, ''I predict to you, they're going to change their position all of a sudden again.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush issued his challenge hours before flying to Chicago, where he planned to begin the Labor Day kickoff of the general election campaign. Polls show the race to be a dead heat or else give Mr. Gore a slight lead. The debates are considered an important forum that could well help undecided voters make up their mind.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and his senior advisers had been saying for weeks that they wanted to explore options beyond those proposed by the bipartisan debate commission, because they felt that there could be other debates of equal or greater value to voters.</p>
        <p>But one adviser conceded tonight that in selecting debates that would be moderated by the journalist Tim Russert in one case and the talk-show host Larry King in another, Mr. Bush was guaranteeing that he would take questions from people who had quizzed him before, and with whom he felt familiar.</p>
        <p>One Republican strategist in Washington said that by spurning two of the three commission debates, which would be more structured, Mr. Bush was showing ''that he's concerned about filling the full two-minute answer'' in a debate with formal time parameters.</p>
        <p>''Larry will bail him out,'' said the strategist, referring to Mr. King. ''Larry will keep it moving.''</p>
        <p>But several of Mr. Bush's advisers said that while journalists were sure to deride Mr. Bush's decision, most voters would care only about the fact that Mr. Bush was debating and would find all the noise surrounding the negotiations to be meaningless.</p>
        <p>''We're not stupid. We've been looking at this,'' said one adviser. ''Nobody knows who the commission is.''</p>
