        <p>Curtis Martin wanted to do more this season, wanted to squeeze more power and strength from his compact body to fill the chasm in the Jets' offense created by the departure of receiver Keyshawn Johnson. He had run in the stairwell of his Florida condominium in preparation for this season and then had the best preseason of his career.</p>
        <p>Today, the Jets gave their fans and opponents a glimpse of what post-Johnson life will look like in a 20-16 victory over the Green Bay Packers, and it looked an awful lot like a Martin highlight reel.</p>
        <p>While Vinny Testaverde took the first half to shuck the rust that enveloped him from spare preseason action in his return from an ankle injury, Martin propelled the Jets. He finished with 110 yards and a touchdown rushing and caught a team-high 6 passes for 34 yards, including a 3-yard catch for the game-winning touchdown.</p>
        <p>But with the Packers rallying in the second half behind Brett Favre -- and with the Jets frequently self-destructing under the weight of penalties and dropped balls -- the Jets needed a spectacular 61-yard reception by Dedric Ward to set up the winning touchdown with 3 minutes 30 seconds to go and a leaping interception by safety Victor Green with 1:08 remaining to preserve Martin's gem.</p>
        <p>That had Al Groh earning his first victory as the head coach and Testaverde weeping from the emotion of his comeback from the left Achilles' tendon injury he sustained in last season's opener.</p>
        <p>''I said this game had the potential to be one of those games that creates a team for the rest of the season,'' Groh said. ''This is one, but a significant one for us, more than just the win. There was an opportunity for our players' will to crack.''</p>
        <p>Was there ever. Testaverde was worried about how he would perform after having so little work during a preseason when he was hampered by a jammed left big toe, and his timing suffered early.</p>
        <p>On the third play of the Jets' first drive, Testaverde expected receiver Wayne Chrebet to cut to his left. Instead, Chrebet ran straight and Darren Sharper picked off the pass, returning it to the Jets' 4-yard line. The Packers scored on the next play on a pass from Favre to Tyrone Davis to take a 7-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Testaverde completed only 11 of 25 passes for 82 yards in the half, so the Jets turned repeatedly to Martin. Of the 15-play drive that culminated in his 2-yard touchdown run to even the score late in the first quarter, Martin was in on 11 plays. And when Martin missed the last drive of the half because he had sprained his left knee, the Jets could not pound the ball into the end zone on three plays from within 11 yards, and settled for John Hall's 23-yard field goal.</p>
        <p>Even Martin, who spoke frequently during training camp of wanting an expanded role from his already enormous load, was not expecting so much attention. ''We've been talking about me catching the ball more this year,'' he said. ''I was surprised, but I believe I was ready for it.''</p>
        <p>The Jets, though, did not look ready in several areas for stretches of the game.</p>
        <p>Twice they found themselves in the end zone with apparent touchdowns, only to have one -- a 7-yard reception by Chrebet -- called back because of a trip by tackle Jason Fabini and another brought back because Ward bobbled the ball as he ran through the end zone. The Jets also had 10 penalties for a total of 75 yards. Twice Hall missed long field-goal attempts and twice the Jets settled for field goals instead of touchdowns.</p>
        <p>But the Jets' defense -- which had been questioned for several shaky preseason performances -- repeatedly kept the Packers out of the end zone. They took Antonio Freeman out of the game, holding him to three receptions for 59 yards, and forced the Packers to kick three field goals, even as Favre, who had elbow tendinitis in the preseason, slowly worked back to form. In all, the Jets held the Packers to 211 yards.</p>
        <p>That was enough to give Testaverde time to find his groove, and he found it with Ward, who is charged with being the No. 2 receiver now that Johnson has gone to Tampa Bay. Testaverde finished 23 for 44 for 261 yards, and the most spectacular completion came on the play that ultimately won the game.</p>
        <p>With the Packers leading, 16-13, midway through the fourth quarter after yet another field goal, the Jets took over at their 26-yard line. Three plays later, Ward streaked down the sideline. This was the same play on which Testaverde had hit Chrebet for a 75-yard touchdown in the preseason against New Orleans. On that play, Testaverde hit Chrebet over the middle. This time, he saw Ward going down the sideline. He hit him in stride at the 30-yard line and Ward ran toward the end zone. He was pushed out at the 2. After two runs, Martin peeked around a defender to grab Testaverde's 3-yard touchdown pass that gave the Jets their final lead.</p>
        <p>Testaverde talked later about how the emotion of his comeback -- coupled with memories of his father, who died in February 1999 -- sent him weeping from the field. He sat at his locker and cried after the game.</p>
        <p>''I felt kind of silly bawling in front of my teammates,'' Testaverde said. ''It hit me all at once. Getting the win, feeling the presence of my father, wishing he was here, all those things made it emotional and made it special.''</p>
        <p>But the Jets needed one more special play to secure the victory. With the Packers driving with less than two minutes to play, the Jets were backing up. On second-and-3 at the Jets' 35, Favre threw to the right sideline. Green leaped and grabbed the ball at the 9, robbing Bill Schroeder of a possible touchdown. ''It was a good throw,'' Green said. ''But it was a better catch.''</p>
        <p>And it was a better victory for a team beset by so many questions entering the season.</p>
        <p>''I believe we had character building last year,'' Martin said of the Jets' 8-8 season. ''This year, this game, showed the result of that character building. I'm not saying we're there. But we're on our way.''</p>
