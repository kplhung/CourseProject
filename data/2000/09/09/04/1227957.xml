        <p>The term ''downtown dance'' takes on a whole new meaning with the ''Evening Stars'' dance week that opens on Sunday in an outdoor theater at the World Trade Center Plaza. True, the kind of avant-garde dance that is usually meant by the term, created in lofts and studios south of 14th Street, will be represented in the new series. But the six ''Evening Stars'' programs include an impressive range of uptown stars and styles.</p>
        <p>That is not surprising, given that the project is the brainchild of Liz Thompson, executive director of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, the producer of the festival. Ms. Thompson has had a long relationship with dance at its most glittering and most funky, from early days as a performer and a fan of the free New York Dance Festival, now defunct, in Central Park to the directorship of the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, from 1979 to 1989. The Pillow was founded by Ted Shawn, who championed eclectic dance programming. And at the Central Park festival, held in the Delacorte Theater, one could often see ballet and modern and ethnic dance on the same night.</p>

        <p>The term ''downtown dance'' takes on a whole new meaning with the ''Evening Stars'' dance week that opens on Sunday in an outdoor theater at the World Trade Center Plaza. True, the kind of avant-garde dance that is usually meant by the term, created in lofts and studios south of 14th Street, will be represented in the new series. But the six ''Evening Stars'' programs include an impressive range of uptown stars and styles.</p>
        <p>That is not surprising, given that the project is the brainchild of Liz Thompson, executive director of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, the producer of the festival. Ms. Thompson has had a long relationship with dance at its most glittering and most funky, from early days as a performer and a fan of the free New York Dance Festival, now defunct, in Central Park to the directorship of the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, from 1979 to 1989. The Pillow was founded by Ted Shawn, who championed eclectic dance programming. And at the Central Park festival, held in the Delacorte Theater, one could often see ballet and modern and ethnic dance on the same night.</p>
        <p>The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, a service organization for artists and a presenter of dance and visual arts in downtown Manhattan for 25 years, has maintained a grass-roots approach while changing with the neighborhood it was formed to serve. ''People were running away from downtown when L.M.C.C. was founded by David Rockefeller and the Chase Bank,'' Ms. Thompson said in a recent interview. ''The new downtown renaissance has allowed a festival of this magnitude to come into being.''</p>
        <p>The council has traditionally provided artists with technical, company redevelopment and grant-writing assistance and full-production stagings. It provides work space to resident artists, among them the dance duo Eiko and Koma, in raw space on the 91st floor of Building One at the World Trade Center, where there will be an open house on Sept. 23 and 24. Today the council also sponsors a digital media showcase program called Thundergulch. And with the ''Evening Stars'' week, it is moving into dance production in a bigger and more wide-ranging way.</p>
        <p>''Evening Stars'' opens with the companies of Ronald K. Brown and Rennie Harris, two hot young modern-dance choreographers. In the dizzyingly varied ''Jazz Riffs'' on Sept. 11, tap will be represented by the Silver Belles, a company of veteran female dancers, and the stylish Young Hoofers. There will also be Broadway jazz dance by Bob Fosse performed by ''A Few Good Men Dancin','' and the avant-gardist Jane Comfort and her company will perform hip-hop-inspired work.</p>
        <p>The company of the downtown-dance pioneer Trisha Brown performs on Sept. 13 in a program that includes a sneak preview of a new piece with a jazz score by Dave Douglas that will be performed live. Ballet will be represented by the vibrant and adventurous American Repertory Ballet of New Brunswick, N.J., on Sept. 14, with the Parsons Dance Company holding the fort for modern dance on Sept. 15. The festival closes the next night with ''. . . And Rising Stars,'' a hyper-eclectic mix of ballet and new modern dance. The performers include Gillian Murphy and Marcelo Gomes of American Ballet Theater and dancers from the San Francisco Ballet and the modern-dance troupes of Ellis Wood, the rollicking Irish-flavored Sean Curran Company and RhythMEK, a new group of former Alvin Ailey principals, who will dance a new piece by Donald Byrd.</p>
        <p>''Shawn lives!'' Ms. Thompson said mischievously of the Pillow founder.</p>
        <p>The criterion was ''just good and interesting work,'' she added. ''I think we have to establish ourselves and a body of work so that we can introduce more and more adventurous dance, gently, over time. Trisha is world-renowned now but considered avant-garde. American Repertory Ballet is a regional company that has gone through some changes. It will be interesting to see them in New York. David Parsons is a crowd pleaser. We open with a dynamic double-header. And 'Jazz Riffs' and 'Rising Stars' explore different aspects of dance.''</p>
        <p>The ''Evening Stars'' festival came into being last year when the Port Authority, which owns the World Trade Center, was looking for a way to make attractive use of the plaza while it was being refurbished. ''People of vision at the Port Authority saw this as an opportunity to bring world-class artists here and they got excited about that,'' Ms. Thompson said. This year the festival presented three weeks of music, theater and dance in June but added a new all-dance week for this month.</p>
        <p>A special stage has been erected, facing out from Church Street and framed by soaring skyscrapers. Next year Ms. Thompson hopes to expand dance to three weeks and to offer open daytime rehearsals that can be watched by passers-by and those grabbing a lunchtime sandwich outdoors.</p>
        <p>''I've tried to build new audiences wherever I've gone,'' Ms. Thompson said. ''This is a realization of a dream. The plaza is one of the most democratic places. It's a clean, fresh space for dance that attracts so many people: 45,000 people work in the Trade Center buildings. Thousands pass through daily. Tourists, people going out for lunch, people on their way to the PATH trains. Some are C.E.O.'s. Some do back-office work.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Thompson envisions her audiences experiencing everything from chance encounters to planned and affordable outings for entire dance-savvy families. And if all goes as planned, some who are new to dance will fall in love with the art and follow the companies as they perform at uptown theaters. ''Different people find beauty and meaning in a vast array of forms,'' Ms. Thompson said. ''Now it is my passion and pleasure to try to open paths for people to see with new eyes what they may not necessarily have grown up with or be accustomed to.</p>
        <p>''This is a wonderful way for a diverse audience to see a very diverse program,'' she added. ''Just pray it doesn't rain.''</p>
