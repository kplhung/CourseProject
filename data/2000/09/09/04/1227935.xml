        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Al Gore's promise of universal health care for children by 2005 (news article, Aug. 30) won't reach its goal unless he publicly addresses the issue of health care coverage for immigrant children. Welfare ''reform'' drastically altered the availability of health and hunger assistance for legal immigrants.</p>
        <p>In 1997, one in five children in the United States was an immigrant or lived in an immigrant family. But children who entered the country legally after 1996 and undocumented children are not entitled to health care except in emergency cases. Also, under welfare reform, immigrant women are denied prenatal care, a policy that jeopardizes not only the life of the mother but also that of an American citizen-to-be.</p>
