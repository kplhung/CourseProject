        <p>For New York moviegoers weary of long lines, sticky floors and poor sight lines, the two huge new theaters facing each other on 42nd Street near Eighth Avenue -- a block once home to several theaters with X-rated movies -- are a welcome improvement. They offer comfortable stadium seating, clean surroundings and the latest digital sound technology. Together, they have 38 screens and more than 8,100 seats.</p>
        <p>But for analysts who follow the movie theater industry, those two costly new movie houses, the Loews Cineplex 42nd Street E-Walk and the AMC Empire 25, are examples of an industry in deep trouble.</p>
        <p>Longstanding distribution practices force them to compete with each other for films, and there are just not enough hits to go around, especially during a lackluster summer like the one just ending. Since theater companies do not allow any film to be shown at more than one site in a single ''film zone,'' which usually encompasses an area of three to five square miles, the Loews multiplex theater that opened in the basement of the Virgin Megastore on Broadway and 46th Street just four years ago is relegated to showing movies well past their prime.</p>
        <p>After AMC opened a popular 24-screen theater in Dallas in 1995, developers and theater companies began building gigantic multiplexes at a frenzied pace. In five years, the number of movie screens in the country has grown to more than 37,000 from slightly fewer than the 28,000 that most analysts agree is the maximum number of screens that can exist profitably.</p>
        <p>As companies open large, luxurious megaplexes -- which generally have at least 14 screens and always offer stadium seating -- they often find themselves taking business away from older, smaller multiplexes (sometimes run by the same companies), which lack the most up-to-the-minute amenities. Often stuck with long-term leases, the companies have not been able to close unprofitable theaters fast enough.</p>
        <p>''It was a mass suicide,'' Sean J. Egan, the managing director of Egan-Jones Ratings Company, a bond-rating company in Wynnewood, Pa., said of the building spree. ''They see their competitors putting up new attractive theaters, so they think that to be competitive they have to do that, too.''</p>
        <p>In recent months, the publicly traded theater companies have watched their stock prices plunge. Bond ratings have plummeted. A few companies, like Carmike Cinemas, a chain based in Columbus, Ga., and Edwards Theater Circuit of Newport Beach, Calif., have filed for bankruptcy protection. Others, like Regal Cinemas and United Artists, are having trouble honoring their loan commitments. AMC Entertainment, for example, cut administrative costs by $20 million last year, in part by dismissing more than 100 people.</p>
        <p>Most recently, Loews Cineplex, the nation's fourth largest movie theater chain and the dominant company in New York, said on Aug. 25 that it might default on its debt payments.</p>
        <p>''This is somewhat of a universal problem for the industry,'' said Dick Westerling, a spokesman for Regal Cinemas in Knoxville, Tenn., which has new megaplexes at Battery Park City in Manhattan and in Brooklyn Heights and will open a theater on Staten Island next month. ''We've had a heavily leveraged scenario that has accompanied the overbuilding,'' Mr. Westerling said. ''And to have a future, you had to build. It's a challenging time for all of us in exhibition.''</p>
        <p>Despite these industrywide problems, more new megaplexes are being built in New York and elsewhere in the country because of competitive pressure or commitments that predate the theater industry's overbuilding and steep financial reversals. Loews Cineplex, for example, plans to open a 14-screen theater on 34th Street and Eighth Avenue in about 18 months. In Ontario, Calif., two new megaplexes run by Edwards Theater and AMC face each other across a parking lot.</p>
        <p>The theater-building boom began during flush times for the movie business. In the 1990's, box-office grosses were steadily increasing, financing was cheap and there was clearly a need to improve the moviegoing experience. Many of the cramped older multiplexes had been incorporated into shopping centers almost as an afterthought, merely to draw evening traffic. Audiences were grumbling about inconvenient show times, sold-out showings and tiny screens. There was concern that more affordable home entertainment equipment would keep people from leaving their living rooms.</p>
        <p>At first, theater companies that opened cinemas in new, underserved markets did very well, said David H. Allen, a media and entertainment analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''All the big players were getting returns on their capital of 20 or 30 percent,'' he said. ''It was like minting money.''</p>
        <p>The industry expected its new theaters to be popular, but it had not expected a major change in moviegoing habits: as megaplexes proliferated, people began to bypass the older multiplexes closer to their homes and to travel farther to go to the newer megaplexes.</p>
        <p>''We knew from the outset the broad geographic appeal that a megaplex would have,'' said a spokesman for AMC, Richard J. King, ''but we did underestimate the effect they would have on the older multiplexes. We were a little surprised by the pace.''</p>
        <p>Besides cannibalizing revenues from their own multiplexes, theater companies cut into their revenues by having so many screens in each megaplex.</p>
        <p>With many screens, a theater can show widely anticipated movies like this summer's ''The Perfect Storm'' or ''The Patriot'' in several auditoriums at once, staggering starting times and making it unlikely that anyone will be turned away. But that means a film will have a shorter life in the theater because most people who want to see it will catch it during the first two weeks of its run, when a larger percentage of the proceeds goes to the film studio, not to the theater company.</p>
        <p>''It's in their best interest for a film to be under their roof for eight weeks,'' Jeffrey S. Thomison, an analyst for Hilliard Lyons, a securities firm in Louisville, Ky., said of the theater companies.</p>
        <p>Compounding the industry's problems was a disappointing summer at the box office. Paul Dergarabedian, the president of Exhibitor Relations, a Los Angeles company that monitors box office performance, estimates that gross box office revenue from this summer's movie season, which ends today, will be 7 percent lower than last summer's: $2.7 billion, compared with $2.9 billion.</p>
        <p>Although some movies attracted large audiences, none generated the excitement of last year's ''Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.''</p>
        <p>''To fill that many seats,'' Mr. Dergarabedian said, ''you have to have a marketplace that's really psyched up, that's excited not only to see the movie they came out to see, but to see another movie next week.'' But instead of building momentum through the summer, attendance has been dropping, he said.</p>
        <p>AMC officials acknowledge that the absence of a box office stampede has hurt its Empire 25 on 42nd Street, the company's first theater in New York City, more than its competitor across the street, although they say both theaters are doing well.</p>
        <p>The AMC spokesman, Mr. King, said his company's interest in Times Square dated to the early days of the neighborhood's revival, long before the Loews Cineplex E-Walk was contemplated. But AMC's complicated project took many years to complete, in part because it involved the renovation and relocation of a 1912 theater. The Empire 25 opened in April, five months after the E-Walk.</p>
        <p>''We were disappointed to find that we wouldn't have that trade area to ourselves,'' Mr. King said. After encountering competition, AMC decided to dedicate the top floor of its new theater to art-house films, a market sector that has also had a slow summer.</p>
        <p>Loews has 128 screens in New York (83 of them in Manhattan alone), and 40 percent of its shares are controlled by Sony Pictures Entertainment, the movie studio. The theater company has more clout with movie studios than its competitors do and often gets first crack at the most anticipated films. As of July 31, E-Walk was the 12th-highest-grossing theater in the country, said Daniel Marks, the executive vice president of ACNielsen EDI, which tracks box office returns. (Mr. Marks said AMC's Empire 25 was too new to be ranked.)</p>
        <p>Mr. King said he expected AMC to get more top films eventually. ''A newcomer doesn't get full allocation immediately,'' he said. ''Normally, it takes one or two seasons.''</p>
        <p>Theater companies are taking  steps to straighten out their financial problems, including closing unprofitable theaters, renegotiating bank loans and slowing the pace of construction.</p>
        <p>Moviegoers are likely to notice some of their efforts, including more advertising before the movies start, kiosks selling movie paraphernalia in theater lobbies and more ads on popcorn bags and everywhere else that theater companies can think of.</p>
        <p>''We're all exploring ancillary revenue streams,'' said Mr. Westerling, the spokesman for Regal Cinemas. ''People will become more creative.''</p>
