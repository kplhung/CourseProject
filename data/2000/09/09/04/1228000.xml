        <p>Five people were arrested yesterday near the United Nations headquarters in scuffles that appeared to have been aimed at the Iranian delegation to the Millennium Summit, one of the largest gatherings of national leaders, which begins today.</p>
        <p>About 4:15 p.m., Abdul Reza Eskandari, 44, who had a Swedish passport, was arrested near 53rd Street and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive for throwing plastic bags of yellow paint at the motorcade of the Iranian president and prime minister, the police said. Mr. Eskandari was charged with disorderly conduct, Officer Theresa Farello said.</p>
        <p>At 5:55 p.m., two men threw yellow paint in the lobby of the United Nations Plaza Hotel, at 44th Street near First Avenue. The men, Mohammed Reza, 44, and Sedigh Hamid, 42, who is from England, also shouted racial epithets, the police said. .</p>
        <p>The president of Iran, Mohammad Khatami, had been scheduled to stay at the hotel, officials said.</p>
        <p>In another incident, a man running down 44th Street threw yellow paint at the hotel. A police officer grabbed the man, identified as Akbar Parizanani, 44, and both fell to the ground. The officer was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center with minor injuries, and the suspect was arrested and taken to Bellevue because he appeared to be emotionally disturbed, the police said.</p>
        <p>Another man, Hojjat Hassany, got into a scuffle with several people at 44th Street and Second Avenue, and was arrested and taken to Bellevue for evaluation. The police, who did not release the charges against the suspects, later closed 44th Street to pedestrians and let people enter the hotel only in groups of 10.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 7, 2000, Thursday  An article on Monday about arrests of protesters in advance of the Millennium Summit at the United Nations, including that of a man accused of throwing yellow paint at the Iranian delegation's motorcade, misstated the starting day of the meeting. It was yesterday, not Monday.</p>
