        <p>The Internet music start-up MP3.com has been on the losing side of a legal battle with the record industry ever since a federal judge decided in April that it had violated the copyrights of the major record companies by creating a central database of CD's to allow users to listen to music from their own collections on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan is set to rule this week on whether MP3.com willfully broke the law or started the service in good faith. Based on that decision, the damages he awards Universal Music Group -- the only one of the five major companies that has not reached a settlement with the company -- could range from $200 to $750,000 a compact disc.</p>
        <p>But no matter what happens in this round, MP3 hopes to turn the tables on Universal, a unit of the Seagram Company, in the final phase of the trial, which will determine how many of the 4,740 of Universal's copyrights in question the company will actually pay damages on.</p>
        <p>Michael Robertson, chief executive of MP3.com, and Edgar M. Bronfman Jr., co-chairman of Seagram, have both testified in the trial.</p>
        <p>In a brief that centers on perhaps the touchiest copyright issue in the music industry, one that has nothing to do with the Internet, MP3.com's  lawyers dispute the validity of nearly all of Universal's sound recording copyright registrations because the  company designated them ''works for hire,'' a concept that, they argue, has no legal basis, and that remains a subject of contention between artists and record companies.</p>
        <p>Copyright experts said that the argument could fail to have an impact on how much MP3.com has to pay. But even so, the music industry might be the worse for having aired in court a question to which it has so far preferred to avoid obtaining a clear yes-or-no verdict.</p>
        <p>''In my view at the end of the day most sound recordings don't qualify as work-for-hire,'' said Peter Jaszi, a law professor at American University. ''And that's something that recording companies would like to avoid having too many courts say too authoritatively. I don't know that this is a knock-out argument for MP3, but from a tactical standpoint it raises the stakes in an interesting way.''</p>
        <p>The ''work-for-hire'' terminology is the subject of a storied battle between music artists and record labels dating to 1978, when the federal copyright law was revised to set the term of a copyright grant at 35 years, after which the rights revert back to their original author. The legislation also identified nine categories of works, including audio-visual works and ''works for hire,'' for which the authors would never recapture the copyright.</p>
        <p>The record companies, which would like to control their copyrights for as long as possible, have argued that sound recordings fall under the work-for-hire category. But musicians contend that they are not ''hired'' by a record label, and that they are more like book authors, whose right to regain the rights to their works is not disputed.</p>
        <p>The controversy reached its highest pitch late last year, when the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group representing the major record companies, succeeded in lobbying Congress to add sound recordings to the categories of works whose original authors could never reclaim their copyright. The group argued that it was merely a technical correction to the existing work-for-hire provision, and it was passed without hearings as part of a budget bill on Nov. 25, 1999.</p>
        <p>But after a surge of protest from outraged artists, Congress is expected in the next few weeks to pass legislation rolling back the statute to its original form, with language agreed on by the recording industry trade group and several groups representing artists.</p>
        <p>That may make this a particularly unwelcome moment for a high-profile court decision regarding whether sound recordings qualify as works made for hire.</p>
        <p>''Assuming this legislation passes, and I have to think it will pass, we're back to the argument of whether sound recordings are works made for hire,'' said Jay Cooper, a Los Angeles music lawyer who represents a large group of artists. ''And I don't think they want that decision out there.''</p>
        <p>The recording industry trade group and Universal's lawyers declined to comment, citing continuing legislation.</p>
        <p>Copyright experts noted that, regardless of language used in any copyright registration, virtually all recording contracts include language in which the artist assigns all rights to the record label, so that Universal's ownership of its sound recordings would not be in question even if Judge Rakoff deems them not to be works for hire.</p>
        <p>But Jeffrey Conciatori of Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe, MP3's lawyer, said that Universal had not provided the contracts in the 51 boxes of documents it turned over to MP3.com during the trial's course.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Conciatori and his team can prove that the copyright registrations are invalid -- even if the copyright itself is not -- MP3.com would not be subject to the statutory damages set out in federal copyright law. Or, if Universal settles with the company during the two months that the judge has allotted for discovery on these issues, the work-for-hire point will be moot.</p>
        <p>In their brief of August 16, MP3.com's lawyers laid out several other challenges they plan to make to the validity Universal's copyright registrations, including the rights that the label asserts to recordings made before 1972, the first year that sound recordings were protected under federal copyright law. At issue is whether compact discs of pre-1972 recordings qualify as new works. Other areas of dispute include copyright ownership of works produced by foreign authors and whether Universal supplied evidence to prove its ownership of the copyrights owned by companies it has acquired or merged with.</p>
