        <p>In ''Bush and Gore Stake Claims to Federal Role in Education'' (news article, Aug. 30), you say there is no evidence that the public is paying more attention to education this year.

That put education way ahead of health insurance (17 percent) and tax cuts and strengthening moral values (both 16 percent).</p>

        <p>We have found that on a surprising number of issues, from gun control to balancing work and family, parents are remarkably unified. One's identity as a parent taps into deep emotional concerns. Candidates who succeed in speaking to voters on issues that matter to them as parents, and education is clearly a prime example, will find that they have struck a responsive chord that could well swing the election this fall.</p>
