        <p>Things were so different at Cave Spring High School in Roanoke, Va. Tiki Barber knew he was the best player on the football field then, which usually meant that every other player chased him around.</p>

        <p>Things were so different at Cave Spring High School in Roanoke, Va. Tiki Barber knew he was the best player on the football field then, which usually meant that every other player chased him around.</p>
        <p>Barber again believes he can beat anybody. When Barber, the Giants running back, took a handoff from quarterback Kerry Collins in the first quarter today, he ran nearly as far as he could to the right side of the field and stared at a mountain of Arizona Cardinals. Barber stopped, turned and cut back across the field. Collins provided one block and Barber squeezed into the end zone for the game's opening score, a 10-yard touchdown. ''You believe that you're better,'' Barber said. ''I'm going to beat this guy on this play, no matter what I do.''</p>
        <p>Barber did and, because he scored two dramatic touchdowns today, helped the Giants to a 21-16 victory.</p>
        <p>Barber conceded that the boundless confidence he now displays was sapped two years ago, when he was in a season-long slump after a good rookie season. He lost his starting job and, worse, his self-assurance. His talent alone could not get him by.</p>
        <p>Barber has regained his confidence, and more.</p>
        <p>''I'm not surprised one bit,'' Barber said. ''I knew I was going to have a big game, and I'm planning on having 15 more, hopefully 18 more.''</p>
        <p>Barber added a 78-yard touchdown run to finish with 144 yards on 13 carries, his second 100-yard game as a professional. He also had 3 receptions for 25 yards and 3 punt returns for 18 yards.</p>
        <p>Later, Barber was not humble, but he also was not boasting after rushing for two distinct but impressive touchdowns. He was the perfect complement for Ron Dayne, the Giants' first-round pick and the other half of the running back platoon.</p>
        <p>As Barber was running across the field for that first touchdown, he said, he could sense the Arizona players hoping someone else would catch him. It was a hot and muggy day, and nobody was prepared for Barber's improvisation.</p>
        <p>''I came to a decision it was going to be me getting negative-3 yards or doing some things I used to do in high school and trying to go back the other way,'' Barber said.</p>
        <p>Offensive lineman Lomas Brown said: ''Tiki's not afraid to do that. He's fearless.''</p>
        <p>The first score made his second touchdown run seem almost routine. With the Giants at their 22-yard line, the defense shifted left and Barber knew what was next. Giants guard Ron Stone and tackle Luke Petitgout opened a gaping hole on the right side, and Barber sped through. He beat Arizona cornerbacks Tom Knight and Aeneas Williams, with Knight failing to make a leaping tackle at the Cardinals' 25-yard line.</p>
        <p>Barber recalled feeling everyone in the stadium looking at him and not wanting to fall short of the end zone.</p>
        <p>He left leaving the Giants' final touchdown for Dayne. The two call themselves thunder and lightning  and combined for 222 yards. They could not be any more different. While Barber showed his ability to slice through defenses, Dayne bashed his way through. He had 78 yards on 23 carries, a 3.4-yard average, modest but effective numbers.</p>
        <p>''It's like a little lineman coming at the guys,'' Brown said of the 5-foot-10-inch, 253-pound Dayne. ''He's going to take a toll on them. All we have to do is stay on our guys because we know we have a bruiser behind us or we have this little sprinter.''</p>
        <p>A fourth-quarter drive epitomized Dayne's style. He carried 6 times for 36 yards, including a 7-yard run through the right side for a touchdown and a 21-3 Giants lead. Barber had 4 carries for 27 yards on that drive and waited to hug Dayne after the touchdown.</p>
        <p>''It's fun watching him because he's so different than me,'' Barber said. ''When he makes some guys miss or runs over a guy, I wish I could do that. But at the same time, I bet he wishes he could run 78 yards for a touchdown.''</p>
        <p>Dayne admitted that he was nervous at the start of his first regular-season professional game, but he eased into a comfort zone by the second half. He agreed that he was more assertive than he had been in the preseason. ''I feel I played pretty good, too,'' Dayne said.</p>
