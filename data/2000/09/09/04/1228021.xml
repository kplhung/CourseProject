        <p>Amid the curious on-lookers, Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati arrived at Arthur Ashe Stadium as grownups last night, with budding bags beneath their eyes and hardly a giggle left in their old souls.</p>
        <p>It was not 1991. And they were not the two innocent teenagers who unabashedly gambled on the lines and captivated the crowd during their epic semifinal at the United States Open that year.

        <p>Amid the curious on-lookers, Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati arrived at Arthur Ashe Stadium as grownups last night, with budding bags beneath their eyes and hardly a giggle left in their old souls.</p>
        <p>It was not 1991. And they were not the two innocent teenagers who unabashedly gambled on the lines and captivated the crowd during their epic semifinal at the United States Open that year. Innocence vanished long ago, and in its place stood two survivors who have found peace in their lives.</p>
        <p>So, Seles and Capriati were not on the court to stage a re-enactment.</p>
        <p>They just wanted to find the game that is within them now, and come up with a victory. With her familiar two-fisted strokes that have not changed with time, a precise Seles continually cracked balls into the corner pockets of the court while Capriati chased them in vain.</p>
        <p>With plenty of attention, but without any drama, Seles advanced to the quarterfinals with relative ease, 6-3, 6-4.</p>
        <p>''Everyone kind of expected it to be like this epic match of '91,'' said Capriati, who was 15 when she lost to Seles in that mesmerizing three-setter. ''That's history. It's a new day and age. It's completely different now.''</p>
        <p>There was no buzz created by sixth-seeded Seles's quick work of the 15th-seeded Capriati. The marquee matchup ended quietly. The real drama was unfolding elsewhere -- in the men's draw, of all places. As Week 1 of the Open closed last night, the men were finally receiving a fair share of the attention.</p>
        <p>Inside the packed Grandstand Court, where fans were sitting in the aisles and chanting for the underdog, Max Mirnyi, a five-set theater production was unfolding. After 4 hours 6 minutes of elapsed match time, an exhausted Mirnyi and Magnus Norman were left sprawled on the court on the last point.</p>
        <p>Wobbly from exhaustion, but feeding off adrenaline, the third-seeded Norman ripped a backhand passing shot across the court and just beyond a lunging Mirnyi. Finally, it was over. Norman collapsed to his knees to celebrate his 3-6, 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4, 7-6 (9) comeback to advance to the Round of 16 while Mirnyi stared up at the night sky from his back.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't matter how you win,'' Norman said. ''Obviously, it was a great match, one of the most thrilling I've ever been a part of. It could have gone either way.''</p>
        <p>No one exhaled until it ended. Afterward, the drained fans were hoarse from their screams, but elated by the kind of match the Open had been lacking for a week. In one rain-soaked evening, incredible matches were breaking out all over the grounds on the men's side of the tournament. Although the weather left several matches hanging in the balance as suspensions were announced about 11 p.m., there was plenty of tension between downpours.</p>
        <p>Through two torturous rain delays, about a half-dozen unsettling thoughts whirled around the head of Marat Safin. His focus was in decline, his serve was on the blink, his attention span was. . . . Wait, now where were his socks?</p>
        <p>In the middle of the locker room, as the rain poured outside, a sweat-soaked Safin realized he didn't have clean clothes in his duffel bag. At that moment, a daylong scavenger hunt began for Safin. While searching for a solution to the sudden slide in his game, he was also hunting down Jeff Tarango for a fresh pair of socks, then Nicolas Kiefer for a new shirt and shorts.</p>
        <p>''I don't think that the people, they will like it if somebody smell on the court,'' Safin explained in his hearty Russian accent. ''I just forgot my socks in the hotel.''</p>
        <p>It was an absent-minded day for the sixth-seeded Safin.</p>
        <p>Instead of securing his third-round match on Day 7 of the Open yesterday, Safin lost his concentration and allowed a two-sets-to-none lead on Sebastien Grosjean slip away. Now, the crowd was intrigued.</p>
        <p>In an instant, Safin was staring at a match locked up at 4-4 in the fifth set when a rain delay of 1:19 minutes arrived.</p>
        <p>Then, after 28 minutes of play, Safin was ahead by 5-4 in the fifth-set tie breaker when another cloudburst stopped play for 1:40.</p>
        <p>Finally, five minutes after play began again inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, a match that began at 11 a.m. ended at around 5:30 p.m. when Safin watched a forehand by Grosjean bound wide.</p>
        <p>A relieved Safin had escaped his third-round scare, 6-4, 7-6 (3), 1-6, 3-6, 7-6 (5).</p>
        <p>''I was like this on the floor,'' said Safin, smiling as he folded his hands in prayer. '' 'Please, please, please, go out, out, out.' ''</p>
        <p>Anything seemed possible last night, except a flashback to 1991.</p>
        <p>If the match between Seles and Capriati fell flat of expectations, there were other dramas during the day and night to fill the void.</p>
        <p>Still, Seles and Capriati did prove one thing: maturity agrees with them.</p>
        <p>''I think this is probably the happiest I've seen Jennifer,'' Seles said. ''I think her boyfriend has had a good influence on her. She's really happy. I think her relationship with her family is fantastic. I think she's found some peace. I remember last year when we played again, and did the press conference, she broke down. I think she's changed a lot in a year. It's great to see that.''</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>JAN-MICHAEL GAMBILL could not pull off his second victory in two days. He lost last night to THOMAS JOHANSSON, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (1). The 14th-seeded NICOLAS KIEFER advanced to the Round of 16 by ending the run of SJENG SCHALKEN, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4. And the 12th-seeded JUAN CARLOS FERRERO held off ROGER FEDERER, 7-5, 7-6 (6), 1-6, 7-6 (6) to get by his third-round match. . . . ARANTXA SANCHEZ-VICARIO, seeded ninth, lost to the eighth-seeded NATHALIE TAUZIAT, 6-3, 6-2, in the Round of 16. . . . Top-seeded MARTINA HINGIS was among those playing matches when play was suspended by rain. She led 11th-seeded SANDRINE TESTUD, 6-2, 1-0.</p>
