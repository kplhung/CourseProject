        <p>It has been a dream come true, Jim Edmonds said, to play for the St. Louis Cardinals. The fans pack the park, wear the colors and adore the players. The team wins, Edmonds produces and everybody is happy.</p>
        <p>''It's unbelievable coming to work here every day and being a part of something like this,'' Edmonds said.</p>
        <p>For the third day in a row, the Cardinals beat the Mets on the game's final pitch. Two of the game-winners were home runs by Edmonds, who smashed a high fastball from Rick White into the right-field bullpen today to give St. Louis a 4-3 victory in 11 innings. The Mets remained a half-game behind the Braves, who lost to the Astros, 9-3.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals bounced in unison as they swarmed around Edmonds at home plate. The Mets, who managed only five hits, were frustrated.</p>
        <p>''For Edmonds to hit them both is even worse,'' White said. ''He's more of an 'I'm-the-hero' guy instead of just, 'We won.' He likes to appease himself more than his team.''</p>
        <p>Edmonds was dogged by that reputation before joining the Cardinals in a trade from Anaheim this spring. He has said the label is unfair, a creation of the media, and he did not take White's criticism seriously.</p>
        <p>''That's pretty unfortunate that a guy who doesn't have any idea who I am or anything about me would say something that silly,'' Edmonds said.</p>
        <p>White had not gotten over the home run after the game, and said he will think about it until he meets up with his family on Monday in Cincinnati, where the Mets play the Reds. Another reunion should lift the Mets' spirits: John Franco, out with a sore left pectoral muscle, could be available on Monday after an encouraging bullpen session today.</p>
        <p>The Mets need Franco, who probably would have been pitching in the ninth inning Friday, when Pat Mahomes gave up the game-winner to Edmonds. The Mets could have used Franco today in the eighth inning, when Turk Wendell and Dennis Cook failed to protect a 1-0 lead.</p>
        <p>The Mets scratched one run off Rick Ankiel today and got seven shutout innings from Glendon Rusch, who tired in the 98-degree heat. But Wendell allowed a leadoff walk and a single in the eighth, and Cook came in to face a pinch-hitter, Placido Polanco.</p>
        <p>Franco has not allowed an earned run since June 21, but Cook has been erratic. His third pitch to Polanco was a hanging slider, and Polanco ripped it into the left-field bullpen for a three-run homer that gave the Cardinals a 3-1 lead.</p>
        <p>''My slider's definitely a feel pitch,'' Cook said. ''I had a real good one the other day. Today, I threw some good ones. The one he hit wasn't real good at all.''</p>
        <p>The ineffectiveness of Wendell and Cook wasted what might have been Rusch's best effort of the year. Rusch kept the Cardinals off balance with his changeup, allowing only four singles over seven innings. No Cardinal got past first base as Rusch struck out seven and walked none.</p>
        <p>As usual, Rusch was given meager run support, but scoring has been especially difficult for the Mets recently. They have batted .198, scoring 18 runs in eight games, since pounding Randy Johnson and the Arizona Diamondbacks on Aug. 25.</p>
        <p>''We've been through it before,'' said Mike Piazza. ''Everybody wants to be the one guy that gets us over the hump. Bubba had a great day today. Unfortunately, no one else could help him out.''</p>
        <p>Piazza was referring to right fielder Bubba Trammell, making his first start since Aug. 15, who knocked in all three Mets runs with a 2-for-4 performance. With two outs in the ninth, Trammell belted a two-run, game-tying homer off Dave Veres, a right-hander.</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine had left-handed options on the bench, but he stuck with Trammell, a right-handed power hitter, and watched him deliver.</p>
        <p>''If there's one time that you think about hitting a home run, that'd be it,'' Trammell said. ''I was trying to drive the ball.''</p>
        <p>Trammell's other hit today was the Mets' first off Ankiel, a rookie left-hander they had never faced. Ankiel overpowered the Mets with a mid-90's fastball and a curveball that tumbled in 20 miles an hour slower. He worked three perfect innings to start the game, striking out six.</p>
        <p>At that point, Ankiel and Darryl Kile had pitched the equivalent of a perfect game over two days; Kile retired the last 18 Mets to bat on Saturday, and Ankiel the first nine today.</p>
        <p>But after walking two batters in the fourth, Ankiel walked Jay Payton with two outs in the fifth. He had Payton picked off first, but Payton slid safely into second, eluding the tag of second baseman Fernando Vina. Payton scored when Trammell looped a curveball into center for the game's first run.</p>
        <p>Mike Bordick also had two hits and Edgardo Alfonzo had one, but the rest of the Mets' bats were dormant for another day.</p>
        <p>''The bad news is we haven't hit for the last week or 10 days,'' Valentine said. ''The good news is, we're going to hit a lot.''</p>
        <p>First baseman Todd Zeile discounted the way the Mets had been defeated in the three games here, saying that a loss is a loss, and walking off the field at the end because of a game-winning hit makes no difference.</p>
        <p>But it may make a difference to the Cardinals. These two teams could meet next month in the post-season, and this series has emboldened St. Louis. ''It gives us a little hope that if we ever run into them in the playoffs,'' Edmonds said, ''we'll have a chance.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>TODD ZEILE left the game with a muscle cramp in his right calf, but said he expected to play on Monday. . . . MIKE PIAZZA was lifted after grounding into a double play in the 10th inning; Manager BOBBY VALENTINE did not want to wear him down. . . . The Mets will promote three or four more players from Class AAA Norfolk on Tuesday: infielder/outfielder JOE McEWING, infielder JORGE VELANDIA and at least one pitcher -- BOBBY M. JONES or GRANT ROBERTS, or possibly both.</p>
