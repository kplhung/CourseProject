        <p>IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS  The Everyday Interactions That Get Under the Skin of Blacks and Whites  By Lena Williams  268 pages. Harcourt. $22.</p>
        <p>It's not easy being white. Consider, for instance, the plight of a white reader of Lena Williams's ''It's the Little Things,'' a popular exploration of how racial prejudice in America affects even the most casual social transactions. According to the black people (including herself) Ms. Williams quotes, we white folks smell like dogs when we're wet, generally look a lot older than our age (unlike blacks, who look younger since, as the saying goes, ''black don't crack'') shamelessly coddle our misbehaving children (unlike black parents, who come down hard on children ''showing out in public'') and, of course, can't dance, party, cook or jump. White women go around flipping their long, straight manes in public, which annoys surrounding blacks, who are sensitive about their hair, while in locker rooms across the land, white men cower in corners when black men undress.</p>

        <p>IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS  The Everyday Interactions That Get Under the Skin of Blacks and Whites  By Lena Williams  268 pages. Harcourt. $22.</p>
        <p>It's not easy being white. Consider, for instance, the plight of a white reader of Lena Williams's ''It's the Little Things,'' a popular exploration of how racial prejudice in America affects even the most casual social transactions. According to the black people (including herself) Ms. Williams quotes, we white folks smell like dogs when we're wet, generally look a lot older than our age (unlike blacks, who look younger since, as the saying goes, ''black don't crack'') shamelessly coddle our misbehaving children (unlike black parents, who come down hard on children ''showing out in public'') and, of course, can't dance, party, cook or jump. White women go around flipping their long, straight manes in public, which annoys surrounding blacks, who are sensitive about their hair, while in locker rooms across the land, white men cower in corners when black men undress.</p>
        <p>A white reader of ''It's the Little Things'' seemingly has only two choices: either to kowtow to all the genial mau-mauing here or to get defensive and, thus, confirm what the black people Ms. Williams quotes also seem to think -- that white people are close-minded, arrogant and often just plain dumb.</p>
        <p>''It's the Little Things'' grew out of an article that Ms. Williams, a longtime reporter and now a sportswriter for The New York Times, wrote for this newspaper in 1997. The article provoked such intense reaction, particularly to the business about whites ''flipping and flopping and slinging'' their hair, that Ms. Williams expanded her investigations into this book, which is clearly modeled on Deborah Tannen's megabest seller, ''You Just Don't Understand.'' Ms. Tannen explored misunderstandings between the sexes that she ascribed to different male and female linguistic styles; Ms. Williams aims to chronicle ''the racial slights and indignities'' that occur between the races -- the everyday kinds of ''little things'' that wouldn't get mentioned in more formal racial discussions sponsored by government or academia.</p>
        <p>For several months Ms. Williams traveled around the country participating in and sometimes mediating mixed-race focus groups. Although ''It's the Little Things'' purports to expose remarks, gestures and assumptions that offend Americans on either side of the racial divide, black voices and views predominate here. Ms. Williams acknowledges that ''blacks appeared more willing than whites to speak openly and honestly about their racial attitudes -- perhaps because we feel we have less to lose. Whites who shared their thoughts and opinions did so, for the most part, only with the assurance of anonymity.''</p>
        <p>A few of those anonymous whites pipe up in this book to register resentment at affirmative action, at the O. J. Simpson verdict and at blacks who talk back to movie screens, but even then Ms. Williams or her black interviewees have the last rectifying word. ''We are a vocal people,'' Ms. Williams asserts in answer to the complaint about chattering movie theater audiences.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Williams correctly notes, blacks have necessarily been studying white behavior for centuries. But from the evidence of this book this hard-won experience has not necessarily generated wisdom. Ms. Williams's interviewees spout off a lot of racial generalizations and summon up all manner of stray anecdotes and gut feelings to back up their essentialist convictions. Even when these remarks seem true -- as they often do -- those truths are well known and rarely provoke more thought. Here's a sampling of the kinds of observations and musings, all made by black interviewees, that compose much of the book: ''We all know that once whites get in, they want to take over. They want to be in charge, whether it's our fraternities, sororities or our churches.'' ''Whites act as though they got all their jobs because they were qualified. For years whites got jobs because their dad played golf with the boss or their mother belonged to the same bridge club as the boss's wife.'' Ms. Williams does little to synthesize the remarks she has elicited from others and weighs in herself with comments like: ''Deep down, many whites truly feel that most blacks look alike.''</p>
        <p>Since ''It's the Little Things'' deals with people's perceptions rather than realities about race, the book doesn't have to trouble itself over the accuracy of these remarks. And since hardly anyone Ms. Williams quotes brings up the issue of class, neither does she, although a recognition of class differences would have been a welcome corrective to the prevailing impression here that all white people are well-connected and that all black people belong to an undifferientated mass. (''An American Story,'' the new memoir by the black journalist and lawyer Debra Dickerson, offers a smart, nuanced counterpoint to the strange silence about class in this book -- as does much of the great African-American fiction and autobiography of the 20th century, from Ralph Ellison to Malcolm X to Toni Morrison.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams's relentless depiction of the vast incommensurability of blacks and whites makes even their most modest social interactions seem as fraught with incomprehension as a lunch for Captain Kirk and the Klingons. In the pages of this book blacks seem at once utterly different from whites yet not at all differentiated from one another. Yet the sociologist Orlando Patterson -- from whom on any single page of his works one learns more about race in America than in this entire book -- observes in ''The Ordeal of Integration'' that Afro-Americans (his term of choice) are quintessentially American in their values and traditions but have as much intragroup heterogeneity as the many European-derived variations of white Americans.</p>
        <p>The biggest problem with ''It's the Little Things'' is the paucity of its argument. Ms. Williams offers no tips to bridge the racial divide she highlights, beyond her suggestion toward the book's end that we all lighten up. Given that the quality of the insights found here don't rise above the level of your average Internet chat room, one wonders what the point of this book is, beyond what one wag noted some years ago when blacks first began to earnestly squeeze toilet paper and hysterically suffer from heartburn in television commercials: foolishness is the birthright of blacks and whites alike.</p>
