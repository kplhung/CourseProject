        <p>When the computer system I.B.M. built to report results at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta malfunctioned, the proud computing giant learned the hard way what it is like to stumble with the whole world watching.</p>
        <p>Now, with the Summer Olympics set to begin this month in Sydney, Australia, and I.B.M.'s 40-year run as a technology supplier for the Olympics set to end in December, Big Blue is pushing hard to make sure it brings home some public relations gold.</p>
        <p>The International Business Machines Corporation, which decided two years ago to end its involvement in the Games, intends to use television and the Internet to widely advertise its role as the 2000 Olympics' chief provider and integrator of information technology. The centerpiece of the campaign will be the official Olympic Games site it has set up to handle a projected six billion user visits during the games, 10 times the traffic during the 1998 Winter Olympics.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. is also setting up Internet stations called Surf Shacks in Sydney. Athletes in the Olympic Village will be able to go online with more than 60 I.B.M. personal computers; the public's Surf Shack, on a barge docked in Sydney's harbor, will also show off I.B.M.'s voice recognition technology.</p>
        <p>The most crucial audience, though, may be the 1,000 or so major customers I.B.M. will entertain in Sydney. The visitors, including executives from telecommunications, transportation, finance, health care and computer services companies, will be shown the full range of I.B.M.'s Olympics products and services at an executive briefing center. The hoped-for payoff is the chance to discuss problems in their businesses that I.B.M. might solve for them. ''It's very strategic marketing,'' said Elizabeth Primrose-Smith, the I.B.M. vice president in charge of sports sponsorships. ''We've found it's very helpful for them to see us in action.''</p>
        <p>The technology challenge in Sydney is akin to creating a huge, transitory multinational business almost from scratch under the pressure of immovable deadlines.</p>
        <p>Olympic officials said that the Sydney Olympic Committee would spend more than $100 million on information technology and communications and receive donated goods and services from I.B.M. and others worth several times that amount.</p>
        <p>In addition to building the official Web site, and systems that handles scoring, and link results to background data about the athletes and the events and distribute results, I.B.M. is involved in such diverse activities as accreditation, accommodations and management of the athletes' medical records.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. is not doing all the work itself. The accreditation system, for example, has been subcontracted to the Sema Group, a British-French technology services company. But I.B.M. is the overall systems integrator, and its Tivoli products will manage the entire infrastructure.</p>
        <p>The company has deployed about 850 computer technicians, who, among other things, have written 12.4 million lines of code and who weeded out 4,000 bugs in the first six months of the year. On-site equipment testing began last September, and three major technology rehearsals were scheduled for this summer.</p>
        <p>''That's three more than we had before Atlanta,'' said Craig A. Lowder, an I.B.M. spokesman.</p>
        <p>The work is winning praise from some technology managers who had a front-row seat on the Atlanta problems. ''It's my impression they've got everything right this time,'' said Klaus Sprick, vice president for technology at Deutsche Press-Agentur, a German news agency that found I.B.M.'s data feeds ''totally unreliable'' in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>I.B.M.'s Atlanta humiliation was magnified because the system that failed was the one delivering scores, times and other results to the news media, so the problem was widely reported. The news agencies and newspapers that had paid for the data service were furious. Ridicule was heaped atop the anger when reports spread that some information passed along included such nonsense as tied final scores in basketball and boxers listed as two feet tall.</p>
        <p>Though I.B.M.'s corporate pride suffered, the company's quarterly earnings, issued during the Games, beat expectations and I.B.M.'s shares jumped.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. said its market researchers found that potential customers did not seem put off, either.</p>
        <p>Both I.B.M. and the International Olympic Committee say that the problems in Atlanta had nothing to do with I.B.M.'s decision to end its association after the Sydney games. I.B.M. had been an Olympic sponsor and technology supplier since 1960, but its role had steadily expanded since 1993.</p>
        <p>By 1998, when it came time to negotiate life after Sydney, I.B.M. was basking in praise for its successful role in the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, and wondering how much longer it wanted to spend ever-increasing amounts on the Games. Though I.B.M. issues no accounting of its Olympics spending, analysts estimated that it invested about $100 million in Nagano. Because the Summer Games are bigger, it was certain to end up with much higher expenses for Sydney -- perhaps double, the analysts said. If it was to continue, it wanted more cash from the local organizing committees to offset the costs.</p>
        <p>But the International Olympic Committee felt that putting so much of the technology in I.B.M.'s hands was leading to needlessly expensive technical solutions. It also wanted to handle sponsorship of Internet-related products and services separately from the rest of information technology so that is could raise more money.</p>
        <p>''We told them the Internet isn't available exclusively at any price,'' said Michael R. Payne, the committee's marketing director, adding that the two sides disagreed over whether the Internet was a medium or a product category that should be covered by the information technology contract. ''We would love to have I.B.M. involved in some aspects as part of a consortium, as in Barcelona'' in 1992, he added, ''but they're saying that's not in their interests.''</p>
        <p>The man on the spot in Sydney is Thomas E. Furey, who has worked at I.B.M. for 37 years and who got his first Olympics challenge soon after Atlanta when he was assigned to investigate why things had gone so wrong.</p>
        <p>One problem was that the Atlanta Operating Committee's technology staff had run the project, making it hard for I.B.M. and other technology vendors to deal directly with the sports organizations and other end users. It did not help that I.B.M.'s own services group, which did much of the project management work for the Atlanta committee, was at the time independent from the rest of I.B.M., Mr. Furey said.</p>
        <p>The Games also came as the industry was moving from mainframe to PC-based computing and lacked many of the tools, like Tivoli, that were later developed to manage distributed computing systems where processing jobs are spread over many smaller computers supported by larger servers.</p>
        <p>Given the job of overseeing Nagano and then Sydney, Mr. Furey insisted that I.B.M. get more control over the deployment of technology and more time for testing. ''We also lowered the threshold of risk,'' he said. ''We didn't use any bleeding-edge technology.''</p>
        <p>Rather than trumpeting new products, I.B.M. marketers are emphasizing that many of the Internet applications being deployed at Sydney are already being used by customers in e-commerce.</p>
        <p>After I.B.M. announced its withdrawal from Olympic sponsorship, the International Operating Committee signed up Sema to take on, through 2008, the bulk of the software and systems work I.B.M. is doing in Sydney. Gateway will replace I.B.M. as hardware vendor for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.</p>
        <p>Much of the work for the 2004 Summer Games in Athens will not be parceled out until after an International Olympic Committee meeting in December, Mr. Payne said.</p>
        <p>''Based on what we read and hear about the I.O.C.'s future direction, our role probably will prove unique,'' Mr. Lowder, the I.B.M. spokesman, said. ''No single company has ever been responsible for as much technology as we have at Sydney, and it doesn't look like any one will be again soon.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 8, 2000, Friday  An article in Business Day on Monday about the role of I.B.M. in supplying technology for the Olympic Games referred incorrectly to the organization that hired the Sema Group, a British-French company, to replace I.B.M. in providing software and systems work after the Sydney Games. It was the International Olympic Committee, not the International Operating Committee.</p>
