        <p>Highlights and lowlights from the weekend.</p>
        <p>LOU TO LETTERMAN  Not only did South Carolina's 31-0 victory over New Mexico State give Lou Holtz his first victory after 11 losses as the Gamecocks' head coach, but it also snapped the nation's longest losing streak at 21 games. The new title-holder? The alma mater of the talk show host David Letterman, Ball State, which was handled by Florida, now ranked No. 8, by 40-19, for its 18th consecutive defeat.</p>
        <p>WHO ARE THESE GUYS?  John Navarre, Michigan's redshirt freshman quarterback, went from clipboard carrier to starter nine days ago when Drew Henson injured a foot. Navarre proved that the Wolverines, now No. 3, were in good hands by tossing four touchdown passes to tie a school record and completing 15 of 19 passes for 265 yards in a 42-7 victory over Bowling Green.  On the first play ofthe game, U.C.L.A. quarterback Cory Paus sprained a ligament on the top of his throwing shoulder. Enter Ryan McCann the next series. Two weeks ago he was demoted from the starting job; Saturday he was thrown in against Alabama, then ranked No. 3. What did he do? McCann was 14 of 24 passing for 194 yards and a touchdown to help the Bruins shatter the Tide's national championship ambitions, 35-24.</p>
        <p>THE HIGHLIGHT REEL  - Michael Vick threw for 186 yards and 2 touchdowns and rushed for 101 yards and 2 more touchdowns, including an elegant and effortless 63-yard gallop as Virginia Tech, now No. 10, walloped Akron, 52-23.</p>
        <p>- Eric Crouch ran for 3 touchdowns and passed for another and Dan Alexander rushed for 208 yards and 2 touchdowns as No. 1 Nebraska warmed up for Notre Dame next Saturday by running over San Jose State, 49-13.</p>
        <p>- Air Force rolled up 583 yards on the ground as five running backs gained at least 50 yards and seven Falcons scored touchdowns in a 55-6 drubbing of Cal State Northridge.</p>
        <p>- Romaro Miller threw for 302 yards and 3 touchdowns and Deuce McAllister scored 3 touchdowns as Mississippi, now No. 19, defeated Tulane, 49-20. Their efforts put them in the Ole Miss record books with the most beloved Rebel of them all, Archie Manning. It was Miller's third career 300-yard game, tying Manning's school record, while McAllister's three visits to the end zone gave him 27 career touchdowns to pass Manning.</p>
        <p>THE QUOTE BOARD  From the Low Country  ''Well, if you can't run the football, you have to throw it. And if you can't catch it when you throw it, you have some problems.'' - Penn State coach Joe Paterno after the Nittany Lions lost to Toledo, 24-6, to fall to 0-2.</p>
        <p>From the High Country  ''I guess there's a new sheriff in town.'' - Colorado State quarterback Matt Newton after his 327 passing yards and 4 touchdown strikes powered a 28-24 victory over then-No. 23 Colorado.</p>
