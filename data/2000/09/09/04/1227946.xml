        <p>Noon, Wednesday, Aug. 30. The ''Page 1'' meeting for Bloomberg News is in full swing at a conference room in Bloomberg's Midtown Manhattan headquarters. Linked by Webcams and video screens, editors in Europe and the United States chew over the day's hot news, discussing what stories belong on Bloomberg's main screen.</p>
        <p>And like any good editor in chief, Matthew Winkler, a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal who has led Bloomberg News since it was founded a decade ago, is not satisfied.</p>
        <p>''This needs to be overhauled,'' Mr. Winkler said as he looked at an article about Royal Philips Electronics with a confusing lead sentence. On another article, he explained, ''I'm not a big fan of this word 'robust' because it means whatever you want it to mean. Do we mean growing demand, increasing demand? Then why don't we say that?''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the meeting was solidly in the tradition of the daily conferences that newspapers use to discuss what articles to publish. There was just one difference. Every report that Mr. Winkler commented on was already out on Bloomberg's 144,000 workstations, a staple of trading floors around the world. These first-version wire stories needed work to meet Mr. Winkler's standards of clarity and style, but they were accurate and on hot topics. So they were posted, whatever their imperfections, awaiting further updating and more editing.</p>
        <p>Welcome to the world of financial news services, the most hotly competitive place in journalism today. With 950 reporters and 79 bureaus, Bloomberg competes to break news with Dow Jones, Reuters and Bridge News along with newspaper Web sites, dozens of smaller Internet sites and even gossipy chat rooms.</p>
        <p>The race never ends, moving with the sun from Asia to Europe to the United States, and at any moment fortunes in trading profits are staked on the speed and accuracy of the news that Bloomberg and its competitors provide.</p>
        <p>It is a fast-growing, lucrative business, but the pressure to be first is not without cost. Ten days ago, Bloomberg committed a spectacular blunder, falling for a fake news release and publishing a report that caused shares in Emulex, a California communications equipment company, to plunge 55 points in minutes.</p>
        <p>The release, which came over Internet Wire, a service that distributes company news, said in suspiciously vague terms that Emulex's chief executive had resigned and the company would restate its earnings. Bloomberg reported the release as fact, even though it was unable to confirm with Emulex that the report was real.</p>
        <p>The hoax was quickly discovered, and Emulex stock regained its value within hours. On Thursday, Federal prosecutors charged Mark S. Jakob, a 23-year-old California man, with securities fraud for the hoax. But Emulex investors who panicked and sold their shares as the stock plunged are unlikely to recover their losses. One angry investor has now sued Bloomberg and Internet Wire, saying he lost $15,000 as a result of their recklessness.</p>
        <p>Still, Bloomberg will continue to use information from PR Newswire and Business Wire, the leading news  release wires, as well as Internet Wire, without verifying its authenticity in most cases, Mr. Winkler said. Financial news services and other media organizations get press releases 15 minutes before they are distributed to the general public, fueling a furious competition among the news services to rewrite them for their subscribers during their window of exclusivity. Given the sheer crush of news releases, wire services do not generally verify their authenticity, a task impossible under current competitive pressures. Traders watch for news intently and react almost instantaneously to news, creating intense pressure on the financial wires to be first with headlines and stories. To keep up, Bloomberg has a team of seven people who monitor news-release wires full-time at its bureau in Princeton, N.J.</p>
        <p>The job has grown harder, said Brian Rooney, a Bloomberg editor. The number of releases has soared the last two years, largely because of the growing number of public companies and start-ups looking for publicity, Mr. Rooney said. ''You end up with just a lot more releases to sort through,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winkler said the hoax has caused Bloomberg to toughen its standards on using information from news releases, even those from PR Newswire and Business Wire. If the releases have unusual information, Bloomberg reporters will now be required to confirm that they are real before using them. For example, if a company reported earnings of 60 cents a share and analysts expected earnings of 58 cents, that would not be unusual. But if the release reported earnings of 20 cents, a reporter would confirm the accuracy of the release with the company.</p>
        <p>''If anything on those releases is remotely a surprise, yes, we're calling them,'' Mr. Winkler said. ''It doesn't matter who's saying it's kosher. We're still going to ask the rabbi to bless them.''</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Winkler also insisted the new policy would not slow Bloomberg. ''We don't intend to sacrifice speed in any way,'' he said. Reporters would have to be better prepared to reach company public relations officers immediately.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, some public relations firms say they want the news-release wires to institute uniform security standards to lessen the risk of another hoax. The news wires should be careful in dealing with news-release wires that do not have strict security, said Tim Johnson, managing director of the San Francisco office of Golin/Harris International, a public relations agency that represents about 450 clients worldwide.</p>
        <p>''We are careful with every release,'' said David Armon, senior vice president of PR Newswire. His company conducts a credit check and calls back companies to verify that they are represented by the public relations firm that says it represents them, he said. Still, PR Newswire cannot vouch for the factual accuracy of its releases, he said. ''As long as the attribution checks out, the clients are allowed to say pretty much what they want to say.''</p>
        <p>Internet Wire says it has tightened its security policies since the hoax.</p>
        <p>Still, Bloomberg's long-term growth is unlikely to be hurt by the hoax. Thanks to the explosion in financial markets, Bloomberg has 17 times as many subscribers as it did a decade ago. The company, which charges more than $15,000 annually for a subscription to its workstations, will have revenue of more than $2 billion this year, and Bloomberg's journalistic ambitions are swelling alongside its financial resources. The service has added almost 200 reporters the last eight months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winkler said the hoax is a chance for Bloomberg to improve its standards and encourage its reporters to think more critically about unexpected news. ''This event to me is an opportunity for us to get to a much higher level,'' he said. ''What I'm trying to do after last week is to try to get people to think.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Winkler is intensifying efforts to have reporters prepare for events they know are coming, like earnings releases. If a release is unusual, reporters will be able to react immediately, confirming the authenticity of the release.</p>
        <p>Still, Bloomberg may not be able to put the hoax in the past as quickly as it would like. An Emulex shareholder who says he lost $15,000 as a result of the hoax sued Bloomberg and Internet Wire on Thursday in federal court in New York, arguing they recklessly disseminated misleading information about Emulex.</p>
        <p>Bloomberg and Internet Wire declined to comment on the suit, which seeks class-action status. Floyd Abrams, an expert in First Amendment law, said the plaintiffs face an uphill battle. The First Amendment protects honest mistakes in news gathering, and information about a publicly traded company is by definition of interest to the public, he said.</p>
        <p>''I would say Bloomberg would have a powerful defense, and the only circumstances they would not is if they knew what they were publishing was false,'' he said.</p>
