        <p>So just how do you get to be an ''It girl?''</p>
        <p>''By having 'It' bigger and better and more fabulously than others,'' said Kristina Stewart, the society editor for Vanity Fair, which features ''The 'It' Parade'' as the cover article of its September issue. And if you generate a little controversy, too, well then so much the better.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart said she began choosing women with ''It'' some months ago, when she ''dumped a big stack of contender photos'' on the desk of the editor of Vanity Fair, Graydon Carter. They and several other editors then ''dished for the better part of an afternoon,'' she said, before choosing 14 women who ''dance on the tables'' and ''change the chemistry of a room just by entering it.''</p>
        <p>Among them: the cover subject Gwyneth Paltrow (the ''uber 'It' Girl,'' according to Ms. Stewart), scions of wealthy and well-known families, including Patricia Herrera, daughter of the fashion designer Carolina Herrera, and self-made ''Its,'' like Cecilia Dean, a magazine editor who also teaches at the Parsons School of Design (''Who needs money when every designer wants to dress you?'' the magazine asks.)</p>
        <p>Was Vanity Fair besieged by public relations representatives? No, said Ms. Stewart, who noted that ''It'' women are so in demand that they use public relations people to decline invitations, not get them. ''The girls we chose all had to be arm-wrestled into being in the feature,'' she said.</p>
        <p>That may be. But Vanity Fair has received some criticism.</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, an article by Gabriel Snyder in The New York Observer noted that the magazine's seekers of ''It'' hadn't had to go very far -- or even to leave their building -- in their search for Ms. Herrera, who works for the magazine, or in finding Plum Sykes, a ''bon vivant'' who works for Vogue, a sister publication of Advance Publications' Conde Nast unit. Ms. Sykes's table-top dancing was said to have recently resulted in the destruction of 350 champagne glasses at a Manhattan restaurant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Snyder never actually uttered the word nepotism, though he implied it. And he quoted Aimee Bell, Vanity Fair's senior articles editor, who said that the omission of Ms. Herrera and Ms. Sykes would have been a ''disservice'' to the ''scholars of 'It-girldom.' ''</p>
        <p>But Entertainment Weekly's managing editor, James W. Seymore Jr., was not so diplomatic. In a letter sent to Mr. Carter, he said that Vanity Fair had engaged in ''imitation'' and ''misappropriation'' in publishing its story, which he said was ''very, very similar'' to an ''It List'' cover that Entertainment Weekly runs annually about ''the 100 most creative people in entertainment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Seymore's letter was reported in The New York Post, which printed much of it verbatim. Ms. Stewart called it a ''thinly veiled publicity stunt,'' and noted that The Vanity Fair article was nothing like the one in Mr. Seymore's magazine, which focuses on people who are prominent in the entertainment industry.</p>
        <p>''Our feature didn't even mention Hollywood,'' she said. ''It concerned itself only with society.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Seymore was out of town last week, and Sandy Drayton, an Entertainment Weekly spokeswoman, declined to comment further.</p>
        <p>''Jim's letter stands on its own,'' she said.</p>
