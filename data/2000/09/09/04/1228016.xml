        <p>The game's first play and its last one caused the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to shiver.</p>
        <p>Nearly every play in between, though, shook the New England Patriots.</p>
        <p>The first play: Tampa Bay fumbled the game's opening kickoff at its own 28, leading to a field goal by the Patriots. The final play: With a second remaining in the game, and New England at the Tampa Bay 22 with a chance to win, the Patriots' final pass by Drew Bledsoe, who was under siege, fell harmlessly out of the end zone without a Patriot even close to making the catch.</p>
        <p>So Tampa Bay won this scramble, 21-16, in a lopsided 5-point victory in front of a crowd of 60,292 at Foxboro Stadium. New England scored its field goal after the game's opening turnover, scored on a 66-yard punt return by Troy Brown in the second quarter and scored on a 39-yard pass play with 3 minutes 1 second left. Other than that, the Tampa Bay defensive line dominated the New England offensive line.</p>
        <p>Bledsoe was hit so many times that his head was probably still ringing after the game. On most plays, he would barely gather the ball from center before a Buccaneer was in his face. Tackle Warren Sapp, defensive end Marcus Jones, linebacker Shelton Quarles and the blitzing cornerback Ronde Barber were among those causing problems. Bledsoe was sacked six times.</p>
        <p>''Emotionally, I'm beat up,'' said Bledsoe, who was sacked six times. Physically, he looked beat up, too.</p>
        <p>''We were talking to him all day, telling him it was going to be a long day,'' said Buccaneers defensive end Chidi Ahanotu. ''He said, 'Yeah, yeah, you're right, it's a long day.' When you can pin your ears back and let it fly, well, you like games like that when you can just hound the quarterback.''</p>
        <p>Sapp, the All-Pro, said he read in a newspaper before the game that he had been handled during the preseason. Sapp was hot.</p>
        <p>''I mean, that upset me so much, I couldn't eat breakfast,'' Sapp said. ''I was sick to my stomach. But we came out and showed what we do. We get after the quarterback and get him, and that's the ultimate prize. We're a team unit -- somebody strikes a match and then everybody pours gas on it.''</p>
        <p>The Patriots were a pitiful 4 of 17 (24 percent) in third-down conversions. They gained more yards on kickoff and punt returns (118) than they did rushing (88). Bledsoe was 26 of 39 for 216 yards with a touchdown pass to wide receiver Terry Glenn and no interceptions. Even on his touchdown pass, Bledsoe barely stood upright long enough to get it off. He was crushed once again by the Tampa Bay defense just as he lobbed the ball into the end zone.</p>
        <p>A relatively immobile quarterback and a leaky offensive line was matched against a fierce pass rush and a menacing defense.</p>
        <p>''We had some trouble on pass protection,'' said Bill Belichick, who lost in his first regular-season game as the Patriots' head coach.''They mixed it up some but kept us off balance. They did a good job.''</p>
        <p>And the Tampa Bay offense did just enough, scoring 14 second-quarter points to lead by 14-10 at halftime. Fullback Mike Alstott scored on a 5-yard run and wide receiver Reidel Anthony scored on an 8-yard pass from quarterback Shaun King. On that play, King acted like he was going to spike the ball but threw it into the end zone instead, a fake-spike play like the one the former quarterback Dan Marino performed a few seasons ago against the Jets.</p>
        <p>Then the Buccaneers scored the only points of the third quarter when Alstott started inside and then bounced outside for a 3-yard touchdown run. That play made it 21-10 with 3:09 left in the quarter.</p>
        <p>The score was set up by a forced fumble -- Buccaneers linebacker Derrick Brooks on Patriots running back Kevin Faulk -- at the New England 24. The ball was recovered by safety John Lynch.</p>
        <p>''I was in the right spot,'' Brooks, who made a game-high 15 tackles, said of the fumble. ''I wanted to be physical and finish my tackles, because I had seen that some of their backs have a tendency to put the ball on the ground. Fortunately, we got it.''</p>
        <p>It looked like Tampa Bay would cruise from there, but Bledsoe to Glenn gave New England a chance, and the last play of the game could have turned the affair upside down.The Tampa Bay defense would not let that happen.</p>
        <p>''If our defense can dominate like that we will be something,'' King said.</p>
        <p>King (12 of 24, 167 passing yards, 1 touchdown and no interceptions) made big plays, too, especially by converting seven third-down passes. He completed four passes to Keyshawn Johnson for 64 yards, and Johnson opened passing lanes for others.</p>
        <p>''We did what we were supposed to do,'' Johnson said, ''and we came out and won.''</p>
        <p>Tony Dungy, Tampa Bay's coach, said: ''Those third-down plays Shaun made were plays we weren't making throughout last year.''</p>
        <p>Now the Buccaneers have more team balance, but make no mistake, its defense rules.</p>
        <p>'' I know we're going to improve,'' Ahantou said. ''But I don't think we've ever been this far along as a defense at this point in the season.''</p>
        <p>That's enough to shake up the rest of the league.</p>
