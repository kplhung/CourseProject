        <p>As Internet companies try to find more efficient ways to acquire customers, a subtle shift is taking place in the balance of power between retailers and the major Web portals they have relied on to send them business.</p>
        <p>Whereas portals like Yahoo, AOL.com  and the Microsoft Network once held almost singular sway over where their users went to buy flowers, music or other goods, recent data indicate that this influence -- though still significant -- is being challenged by shifting Internet traffic patterns.</p>
        <p>A study to be released this week by the Internet audience measurement service Nielsen/NetRatings confirms this trend, finding that the portals are losing their dominant position as the source of traffic for e-commerce companies.</p>
        <p>A year ago, the portals were the top source of referrals for 54 percent of all e-commerce sites, the study found, compared with 46 percent of e-commerce sites today. The leading referral site, Yahoo, was the top source of traffic for 30 percent of e-commerce sites last July, but only 18 percent of Internet retailers this summer. The data for the survey was based on 809 sites tracked by Nielsen/NetRatings.</p>
        <p>Sean Kaldor, vice president for e-commerce for Nielsen/NetRatings, said retailers were seeking out partnerships with types of Internet companies other than portals. Moreover, the study found a new category of sites is gaining influence in the referral arena: sweepstakes and lottery sites, like Iwon.com, Freelotto.com and Gamesville.com, in part because those sites offer partners an alternative business model.</p>
        <p>According to the study, less than 1 percent of referral traffic to e-commerce sites came from sweepstakes or game sites in July 1999, but by July 2000, that figure was nearly 8 percent. Mr. Kaldor said these sites were gaining influence partly because they generally offered partners a ''pay per click'' advertising model, in which a retailer pays the referring site only for customers who click on a link to the retailer's site, at a rate of about 40 cents a referral.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaldor acknowledged that there were drawbacks to relying on sweepstakes sites to refer customers. Users of lottery sites tend be in lower income brackets, and it is not clear whether visitors referred from these sites -- who sometimes earn points for clicking on retailers' links -- ever become long-term customers.</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Kaldor said the sweepstakes sites bear watching.</p>
        <p>''If the trend continues,'' he said, ''they do pose a serious threat to the traditional portals.''</p>
