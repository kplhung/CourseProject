        <p>Old cotton mills and warehouses that stockpiled cargoes from the Mississippi River as far back as the 1830's are being transformed into art galleries, artist studios, lofts, hotels, cafes and restaurants in an expanding hundred-acre area of some 50 blocks.

        <p>All around the National D-Day Museum, which landed here on June 6, an invasion of art is refashioning New Orleans's once forlorn warehouse district into a chic enclave of culture and condominiums.</p>
        <p>Old cotton mills and warehouses that stockpiled cargoes from the Mississippi River as far back as the 1830's are being transformed into art galleries, artist studios, lofts, hotels, cafes and restaurants in an expanding hundred-acre area of some 50 blocks. A museum of Southern art is rising near a former German brewery that tells the story of the victory over Hitler, and another large conversion is turning an old industrial building into artist studios, antidotes to the crime that long plagued the derelict warehouse district, sandwiched between the French Quarter and the Garden District.</p>
        <p>While it began as a renewal district bounded by Poydras Street and Howard Avenue from the Convention Center Boulevard to Magazine Street, by some definitions its western boundary has been pushed back close to the Superdome, almost doubling its territory and taking in much of the business district.</p>
        <p>''It was skid row,'' said Donna Perret, director of Galerie Simone Stern, one of the early arrivals. She recalled warily walking the district's streets. ''I had a guard to make sure I wasn't mugged and could get to my car,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Now gallery hopping in the warehouse district is joining the city's traditional infatuations with dining and jazz. In an open-house program called ''Art for Art's Sake,'' the galleries, about 20 sprinkled around the spine of Julia Street, stay open late on the first Saturday of each month. Thousands of revelers converged on the district on Aug. 5 for the sixth annual White Linen Night, featuring gallery receptions and (this being New Orleans) street music and cash bars, culminating in a party at the Contemporary Arts Center, a converted pharmaceuticals warehouse that became a home for visual and performing arts programs in 1976.</p>
        <p>There was ample cause for celebration, said Patricia Gay, executive director of the Preservation Resource Center, a private nonprofit organization that has been guiding the revival from an 1832 town house on Julia Street. ''Whatever we do, we end up having a party,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But there is nothing frivolous about much of the art on display. One prime showcase, the Arthur Roger Gallery on Julia Street, featured the patterned paintings of Robert Gordy, the fanciful sculptures and paintings of Ida Kohlmeyer and the work of the Shreveport sculptor Clyde Connell, known for her totemic figures. It also recently showed giant granite monoliths sculptured by Jesus Bautista Moroles of Rockport, Tex., who was featured in a show of Hispanic artists at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1989.</p>
        <p>Many industrial districts, from SoHo to the downtowns of Newark, Pittsburgh and Cleveland, can claim degrees of revivals sparked by arts projects. But the comeback here seems at least partly attributable to a commercial debacle: the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition nearby at the riverfront. The scandal-tainted fair, with accusations of improprieties, including kickbacks, lost $130 million when expected crowds failed to materialize. But by forestalling other development while drawing architectural talent to the city, the flop appears to have planted seeds for  today's preservation and redevelopment.</p>
        <p>''Even though the fair was an economic failure, it revitalized the district,'' said Lea Sinclair Filson, director of public relations for the ultra-luxurious Windsor Court Hotel downtown, not far from the district. (In 1998 Conde Nast Traveler called it the best hotel in the world.)</p>
        <p>She and her husband, an architect, recently moved into a warehouse they renovated. ''It brought locals back to the river, like a renaissance,'' she said. ''We have fond memories of the world's fair.''</p>
        <p>Success, when it came, seems to have priced out many artists. ''We never went through the loft phase,'' said Ms. Gay, contrasting the New Orleans experience with that, say, of New York, where artists colonized cheap manufacturing lofts, only to be priced out by the gentrification they engendered.</p>
        <p>Still some artists have taken up residence in the warehouse district, which abuts (some would say encompasses) another historic district, Lafayette Square. ''We just sort of discovered it,'' said Ellen Pincus, a jeweler whose work in silver and gemstones is on display in Ariodante, a crafts gallery on Julia Street. She and her boyfriend, who both moved here in February from Chicago, pay $920 a month for a one-bedroom apartment in a converted cotton mill on Poeyfarr Street. She said they would like more space but find the rents steep.</p>
        <p>Still, she said, they love the warehouse district and the opportunities. They were promptly put on a jury for the independent film festival at the Contemporary Arts Center.</p>
        <p>''In Chicago I couldn't have gotten on a jury,'' she said. ''It's like they were thanking us for just showing up. It's very bizarre here, actually.'' But best of all, she said, she sold some earrings to the novelist Anne Rice, who has a house in the Garden District.</p>
        <p>Two other big openings in the warehouse district are set for next year: the Ogden Museum of Southern Art of the University of New Orleans, housing one of the largest such collections in the nation, and  Louisiana ArtWorks, a 78,000-square-foot complex of ateliers and demonstration studios for artists inside the preserved shell of the old Bradford Furniture Store, put up before World War I.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile the Ogden, being built around 1,200 works donated by the philanthropist and businessman Roger H. Ogden, has opened a temporary site two blocks away on Julia Street. One recent exhibition featured artists' views of daily life in the South during World War II, a show intended to mesh with themes at the D-Day museum.</p>
        <p>The Ogden's new director, J. Richard Gruber, who came from Atlanta, where he was founding director of the Morris Museum of Southern Art, said the gallery scene was already more concentrated here than in Atlanta and benefited particularly from the strong emotional draw of the D-Day museum.</p>
        <p>Clearly the biggest sign of the turnaround is the D-Day building, a reconstruction of the Weckerling Brewery. Built in 1887, it has been expanded to 70,000 square feet at Magazine Street and the former Howard Avenue, which was recently renamed Andrew Higgins Drive in honor of the New Orleans shipbuilder who produced the war's crucial 20,000 invasion boats. With its stark wartime artifacts and mixed-media exhibitions, the museum has proved so popular, particularly with World War II veterans and their families, that it issues timed-entry tickets to ease the flow of 1,300 visitors a day.</p>
        <p>A second phase of construction is expected to expand the museum's scope to the Pacific war, with the opening of a 5,000-square-foot exhibition scheduled for Dec. 7, 2001.</p>
        <p>But the boom has its downside. ''We recently lost two artists because someone bought the building,''  said Ms. Perret, the gallery director. ''They had to leave.''</p>
        <p>Still, this is a far cry from the problems of old, as remembered by Beverly Gianna, vice president for public affairs at the Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau. It was not so long ago, she said, that the population of the warehouse district numbered two, both of them living on the street. Now, she said, some 5,000 people have moved in.</p>
        <p>Ms. Perret of Galerie Simone Stern noted that ''crime is down because people are stabilizing the neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>''It's more than a patina,'' she said. ''It's settled. It's going to stay.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Perret said she found the warehouse district more alluring even than the somewhat larger French Quarter that remains the city's biggest tourist draw. ''I love the Quarter like a village,'' she said. ''But there's an energy here.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 11, 2000, Monday  An article in the arts pages on Monday about a culture boom in the warehouse district of New Orleans misstated a previous title of J. Richard Gruber, director of the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, and referred incorrectly to his former museum. Mr. Gruber was founding director of the Center for the Study of Southern Painting at the Morris Museum of Art, not founding director of the Morris Museum of Southern Art.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the location of the Morris Museum. It is in Augusta, Ga., not Atlanta.</p>
