        <p>When General Motors announced last month that Carl C. Icahn was buying its stock, Wall Street analysts quickly surmised that he saw potential in the Hughes Electronics Corporation, the satellite-television unit.</p>
        <p>General Motors, which acquired Hughes Aircraft in 1985, has sought ways in recent years to unlock the value of the fast-growing unit, whose coveted satellite TV operation known as DirecTV is expected to have 10 million subscribers by year-end. Early on, G.M. issued a Hughes tracking stock, which reflects the performance of the unit.</p>
        <p>This year, the company distributed more Hughes stock to shareholders. But the moves have done little to appease Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Icahn, who is known for identifying undervalued assets and who recently made a $600 million profit on his Nabisco holdings, has raised investors' expectations.</p>
        <p>In an interview last week, Harry Pearce, vice chairman of General Motors, said the company was considering an outright sale of the company, a merger, or partnerships and joint ventures with other companies.</p>
        <p>''We clearly believe that the market is not properly valuing the company,'' Mr. Pearce said. ''We are carefully evaluating the different options.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearce declined to name Hughes suitors but outlined the three types of businesses that G.M. considered likely partners: direct broadcasters and competitors of DirecTV, media companies and Internet or broadband concerns.</p>
        <p>General Motors, however, has several issues to sort out before a deal can be brokered, and any announcement is probably months away.</p>
        <p>One problem is that an outright sale of Hughes could create a big tax liability. General Motors bought Hughes for $5.3 billion in cash and stock, and some analysts suggest that it could fetch $60 billion today.</p>
        <p>Second, General Motors gets a credit rating boost by owning Hughes, a valuable asset, and analysts say it would be unlikely to take any action that would jeopardize that rating. They note that a lower rating would adversely effect its robust consumer lending business, which accounted for 26 percent of G.M.'s profit last year.</p>
        <p>Most stock analysts expect General Motors to do some type of an equity transaction, a merger or stock exchange perhaps, with a cash component. Mr. Pearce, too, was quick to point out that ''cash is king.''</p>
        <p>But the automaker must decide what stock -- media, Internet or otherwise -- it is willing to accept in any transaction.</p>
        <p>The most logical partner, according to stock analysts, would be a media company. They point to renewed interest from Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation, the media giant that held discussions with Hughes earlier this year, according to people who were briefed on the talks. Hughes' DirecTV would give Mr. Murdoch the distribution he desires in the United States. But the News Corporation is taking public Sky Global Networks, a satellite service for pay television, Internet and data services, and it is not clear how much Mr. Murdoch could offer and whether General Motors would be willing to accept Sky Global stock.</p>
        <p>People who have been informed about the various discussions said that General Motors is also mulling some type of combination with several other media companies, including Disney, Viacom, and NBC, a unit of General Electric.</p>
        <p>Marc Nabi, who follows satellite communications companies for Merrill Lynch, said an acquirer might have to offer $60 billion for the Hughes assets. But he warned that the acquirer or partner that Hughes prefers might not be the one G.M. would pick.</p>
        <p>''If I were a betting man, I think General Motors wants to let Hughes think about it and come to them with an idea,'' Mr. Nabi said. ''It will go to the highest bidder.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn has not discussed his wishes but has simply notified G.M. that he is seeking to buy at least $15 million in G.M. stock, and no more than 15 percent of the company. News of his interest pushed up both G.M.'s stock and the Hughes tracking stock. G.M.'s shares closed the week at $73.125, well off its recent high of $94.625 in April. The Hughes shares, G.M.'s class H, closed at $34.813, also well off their $47 high point earlier this year.</p>
        <p>From a strategic point of view, Mr. Pearce said Hughes is grappling with whether it should align itself with one company or strike alliances with several content providers. ''We see competing approaches,'' he said. ''We're trying to sort that out.''</p>
        <p>G.M. also has to decide whether nonmedia partners would make more sense for Hughes. It could try to merge with a competitor like Echostar Communications, which would expand the customer list but might raise antitrust questions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearce did not discount the possibility of a merger between Hughes and Echostar. Satellite makers now compete with cable and telecommunications operators to provide Internet access to homes and businesses. As such, they should be able to argue that cable and telecommunications companies are the competition, not each other, he said.</p>
        <p>Hughes could even opt to merge with an Internet company -- an approach considered less likely. Hughes is developing new satellite programs that it hopes will create two-way transmission not only with television sets, but also with personal computers and other devices. So becoming a bigger part of the online revolution is not out of the question.</p>
