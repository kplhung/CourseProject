        <p>Vojislav Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer, was fired from the Belgrade University law faculty in 1974 for defending a senior professor jailed for criticizing the government. In 1989, when Serbia's new leader, Slobodan Milosevic, tried to co-opt intellectuals and offered to rehire those fired then, only Mr. Kostunica refused.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Kostunica, a moderate nationalist, anti-Communist and democrat, is trying to take Mr. Milosevic's job as Yugoslavia's president in elections later this month. He is the most serious opposition candidate ever to challenge Mr. Milosevic, and polls suggest that Mr. Kostunica, now 56, ought to be able to win.</p>
        <p>It is an election being closely watched by Washington and NATO, which bombed Yugoslavia for 78 days last year over Kosovo and have labored since to push Mr. Milosevic out of office.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Milosevic, who has been indicted for war crimes, this election has turned into a battle for his political survival. He called it nine months early to shore up his international legitimacy, but now he may be forced to steal votes in order to prevail.</p>
        <p>''In some sense, it's a matter of life and death for him,'' Mr. Kostunica said in a long interview here. ''It's why I hesitated in the beginning. I thought Milosevic must have considered everything very carefully, but I overestimated the rationale in his decision. Now I think he miscalculated, and I'm sure he did not expect my candidacy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, who describes himself as a generally pessimistic man, now senses ''a feeling of victory in the air.'' He said: ''This is the moment -- people can't keep living, or surviving, like this. Individuals come up to me and say, 'Save us,' and they are sincere. And they say, 'I'm hungry.' People know that if Milosevic stays in power they will go on living like this. It's an important feeling. But it frightens me, too.''</p>
        <p>Why? ''It's frightening because the stakes are so high for him,'' Mr. Kostunica said slowly. ''Milosevic will do everything he can to win in the first round,'' even if it risks popular anger over fraud, sets off a new round of opposition demonstrations and undermines the renewed democratic legitimacy he seeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica is one of four major candidates. If no one wins more than 50 percent of the votes on Sept. 24, there would be a second-round runoff between the two top finishers on Oct. 8. In a free and fair, head-to-head race with Mr. Milosevic, all the polls show, Mr. Kostunica (pronounced, kosh-TOON-itza) is almost sure to win.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kostunica is not convinced that Mr. Milosevic will allow himself to be beaten or has any intention of handing over power peacefully. He expects widespread vote stealing and even raises the possibility that Mr. Milosevic will postpone these elections by creating some military ''emergency,'' Mr. Kostunica believes.</p>
        <p>This skepticism about the election results -- no matter the vote -- is widespread, and is among the opposition's greatest problems. While some 35 percent of voters in the polls back Mr. Kostunica compared to some 25 percent for Mr. Milosevic, about 16 percent back other candidates and 24 percent say they will not vote or are undecided. But more than 45 percent say they expect Mr. Milosevic will remain in power after the elections in any case.</p>
        <p>''People are fatalistic about the way they see these elections,'' Mr. Kostunica concedes. ''Our biggest challenge is to convince people that their vote, which does not require too much investment from them, can change Serbia.'' Mr. Milosevic, on the other hand, with state television and a disciplined party behind him, will try to keep turnout low, while seeking to win with high and uncheckable vote totals from Kosovo itself, refugees from Kosovo in southern Serbia, the army and the police, Mr. Kostunica said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic's campaign is concentrating on his defense of the Serbs against the united might and perceived injustice of the West, his administrative competence, his work to rebuild the country after the bombing and his promises of stability and development. His slogan is ''Under the flag of freedom, for Yugoslavia.''</p>
        <p>Even a Milosevic defeat would not suddenly change Yugoslavia, Mr. Kostunica cautions. With Montenegro's government boycotting the election, Mr. Milosevic's coalition should retain control over the federal Parliament, as they continue to run Serbia, the larger of Yugoslavia's remaining two republics since the country all but disintegrated in the 1990's. And with the opposition still divided on the local level, despite American pressure to unite, the ruling parties could win back some cities they lost in 1996.</p>
        <p>''This the moment when the first step will be made,'' Mr. Kostunica said. ''What's problematic is that the first step is the presidential elections, where Milosevic is running, and so where it's the easiest, it's also the hardest.''</p>
        <p>For the Yugoslavs, Mr. Kostunica's virtues are many: a reputation for modesty, honesty and principle; a belief in democracy and the rule of law; a career untainted by any previous cooperation with the Milosevic regime; a clear patriotism and sense of nationhood; and a nuanced but sharply critical stance toward the United States and the Western countries that bombed Yugoslavia last year.</p>
        <p>His main campaign poster plays on his incorruptibility, saying: ''Who can look you straight in the eyes? Kostunica.'' It is a quiet commentary on the accusations often made against other opposition leaders like Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement and Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party, who are seen as having been tarnished by their past associations either with Mr. Milosevic or the West.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica's patriotism, his criticism of the war-crimes tribunal at The Hague as a political instrument, his support for Serbs in Kosovo and his skepticism toward the West made him a good choice for a democratic opposition accused over and over again by Mr. Milosevic of being traitors in the pay of Washington and the NATO countries that bombed Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>It was easy for the regime and state television to attack Mr. Djindjic and Mr. Draskovic, who was filmed kissing the hand of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, for being Western lackeys. But it can only accuse Mr. Kostunica of being allied with them -- of shaking the hand of the man who kissed the hand of Dr. Albright.</p>
        <p>As the federal information minister, Goran Matic, said: ''The West picked Kostunica because he could look like a genuine Serbian candidate. But he is the candidate of Madeleine Albright, and Milosevic is the candidate of the people of Yugoslavia, and they will vote for the man who defended them.''</p>
        <p>There have been a few personal attacks. The Radical Party leader, Vojislav Seselj, has insinuated that Mr. Kostunica is somehow unmanly because, although married, he has no children and is very fond of his two cats. ''I think it's just silly,'' Mr. Kostunica said. ''A friend told me that when he heard the story about the cats he realized they couldn't find anything else.''</p>
        <p>State-controlled news media have also made contradictory charges that Mr. Kostunica, who was once pictured with an assault rifle in Kosovo, is too nationalist, but also that he intends to break up Serbia, since he is supported by Muslim parties in Sandzak and opposition parties in Vojvodina that seek greater autonomy.</p>
        <p>In the interests of unity, Mr. Djindjic and the other opposition leaders threw their support to Mr. Kostunica; only Mr. Draskovic refused to join the united opposition, naming his own presidential candidate, the Belgrade mayor, Vojislav Mihailovic, whose presence in the race will make it nearly impossible for Mr. Kostunica to win in the first round.</p>
        <p>In a rally Friday night kicking off his campaign, Mr. Kostunica vowed to defend Yugoslavia and bring it back into Europe; promised generosity and no revenge toward the regime and its servants; and pledged his ''word of honor'' to ''try to change this state of ours for the better in accordance with God's and human laws, and to never let power change me.''</p>
        <p>A rather shy and reserved man, he seemed almost overwhelmed by the response to his words.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, despite his criticism of Western arrogance and hypocrisy now, is a believer in democracy and the rule of law. He translated ''The Federalist Papers'' into Serbo-Croatian in 1981, and was a member of a committee to defend freedom of speech in the early 1980's, when the post-Tito regime cracked down on advocates of nationalism ranging from Franjo Tudjman in Croatia and Mr. Seselj in Serbia to Alija Izetbegovic in Bosnia and Adem Demaci in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>He helped found the Democratic Party in 1989, when, as he said, ''I lived in that democratic air. But my picture of the West was rather idealistic. I haven't changed my values or pro-Western attitudes despite my criticism of the United States during the war; I see it as defending the West from itself, insisting on original democratic and liberal values.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, he thinks there must be a counterbalance to American power, that the tribunal in The Hague is an instrument of American political goals rather than a model of legal justice, and that Washington too often insists on supporting politicians, like Biljana Plavsic and Milorad Dodik in Bosnia, who do not have realistic support in the larger population.</p>
        <p>He thinks that Washington has helped Mr. Milosevic remain in power first by supporting him and then by attacking him and punishing all Serbs with bombs and sanctions, making the country hostages in ''a private war.''</p>
        <p>Tactically, of course, it is also important for Mr. Kostunica to keep his distance from Western oral and financial support for the opposition here and for his own candidacy. He has set up his own campaign structure, separate from the alliance operation Mr. Djindjic runs, to protect himself from too much Western taint. And Mr. Kostunica has criticized the Americans for setting up a Belgrade embassy in exile in Budapest to assist Serbia's democrats, saying that such a goal is a ''kiss of death for all truly democratic and patriotic forces in Serbia.''</p>
        <p>Still, he says, he wants Yugoslavia to rejoin Europe and the West, ''and I'm prepared to take steps to ensure it.'' Handing over Mr. Milosevic to The Hague, however, would not be a priority, he said.</p>
        <p>''Everyone in this country is in need of some stability and peace,'' said Mr. Kostunica. ''That's my message to the state apparatus, the army and the police, who need it, too. They also don't see a clear future if nothing changes here, and many of them are also tired of all this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica finds it hopeful that ''someone who has never been part of the Communist nomenklatura appears to have a chance'' to take the country into a different future. ''I sometimes have a vague, irrational feeling that if it happens, it would be a form of justice,'' he said quietly.</p>
        <p>''It would be a validation of the beliefs that our families had for the last 50 years, and it would be some sort of God's justice.''</p>
