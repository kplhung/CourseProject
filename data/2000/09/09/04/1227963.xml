        <p>THE holiday weekend signals the start of a peak season for sports fans, who can finally supplement their baseball-only diets with smatterings of professional football, basketball and hockey.</p>
        <p>Web sites like Viacom's CBSSportsline.com, Disney's ESPN .com and the News Corporation's FoxSports.com cheer the approach of autumn, as well, as fans increasingly flock to their personal computers to trade gossip, scores and injury reports.</p>
        <p>A year ago, many of those sites also promoted new online stores, figuring that fans would snap up jerseys, caps and other sports goods while checking up on their teams. Forget the fact that those media companies had almost no experience in retailing: this was during the high-water mark for e-commerce, when the mere mention of the term was enough to send an Internet company's stock soaring.</p>
        <p>Twelve months later, these so-called ''sports content'' sites are putting as much distance as they can between themselves and their e-commerce experiments. They have seen the misery visited on electronic retailers by investors, and they have seen, first hand, the reasons Wall Street turned a cold shoulder to Web merchants. It is costly, difficult work, offering few prospects for profit in the short term.</p>
        <p>Which is not to say that the sports sites are eschewing e-commerce altogether. Rather, many of them are taking a new approach to selling goods online, one that gives content sites a way to glean the benefits of e-commerce while avoiding the headaches such an effort can cause.</p>
        <p>The newest strategy is to place the site's store in the hands of an outside company -- in industry terms, outsourcing. This approach has not only given sports sites a reliable source of revenue and a way to keep fans on their sites, but it has also given rise to a new category of behind-the-scenes e-commerce companies that analysts said may be better positioned for long-term success than some of the more well-known e-tailers.</p>
        <p>''This gives the sports content guys an easy way to monetize their traffic,'' said Shawn Milne, e-commerce analyst for E*Offering, an online investment firm. ''And it lets them get back to what they do best.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milne said the leading company providing such services to sports-related sites was Global Sports Interactive, which created and runs the online stores of the Sports Authority and Group Rallye's Athlete's Foot, among other retailers. More recently, it has begun to do the same for FoxSports.com, with other sites to follow, executives said.</p>
        <p>Michael Rubin, the chief executive at Global Sports, says the company handles all aspects of the store for the clients, including customer service, orders and returns. In exchange, it keeps roughly 92 percent of the site's revenue. ''All of my partners are making money on e-commerce,'' Mr. Rubin said, ''while everybody else is out there spending their brains out on marketing and building the infrastructure.''</p>
        <p>One reason for the company's success, he continued, is that it operates in a highly fragmented market. ''This is a $50 billion market, and the biggest retailer is Sports Authority, which has $1.5 billion in sales,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''So there's really no one with the critical mass to do e-commerce successfully on their own.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, he said, sporting goods stores sell 85 to 90 percent of the same inventory. So instead of many companies building Web sites, call centers and warehouses filled with the same 90,000 items, Global Sports operates a central warehouse carrying those items. It also has a single call center in which representatives handle each store's customers separately. And the fact that Global Sports operates anonymously -- customers have no idea that they are not actually buying from the Web site they are on -- means that it can avoid the marketing costs that have sunk other e-commerce companies.</p>
        <p>But such anonymity also carries a degree of risk for the Web sites, analysts said. If their customers have problems, the Web site's reputation suffers, rather than that of Global Sports. Jon Richmond, who oversees FoxSports.com as president of the News Corporation's digital media group, said that risk was small.</p>
        <p>''We've been pretty vigorous about testing and checking their approach so they maintain quality standards for us,'' he said, adding that Fox Sports had just rolled out its online store with Global Sports last week, ''so it's a little early still.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Richmond said that the two companies shared information on customer satisfaction, ''so we'll know what's happening there.''</p>
        <p>''And Global Sports isn't doing this just for us,'' he said. ''They're doing it for Kmart, Sports Authority and others who'll demand that they stay vigilant about things like customer service and fulfillment.''</p>
        <p>Other behind-the-scenes e-commerce companies have found increasing demand among sports content sites, as well. EFanShop.com, for one, recently created a store for MSNBCsports.com featuring licensed sports goods with the logos of professional and college teams.Marc Andres, eFanShop's chief executive, said sports content sites were ideally suited to such impulse purchases as team jerseys and caps, ''because no one really wakes up in the morning to say, 'I think I'll buy a Chipper Jones jersey,' '' he said. ''They do it while they're checking scores.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Andres said eFanShop relied on distributors or vendors to ship 75 percent of its products directly to consumers, and kept the other 25 percent in a fulfillment center that is run by SameDay, a company that specializes in shipping and handling e-commerce orders.</p>
        <p>Peggy White, MSNBC's vice president for business development, said she was approaching the company's Fan Shop, as it is called, as an experiment that could lead to stores in other areas of the site. ''If there's a context for it -- say, a book review, and we want to give someone the opportunity to buy the book -- we could do it.''</p>
        <p>The sports section of the site is an obvious place to start, she said. Some 20 percent of MSNBC.com's visitors head to the sports section of the site, and sports merchandise lends itself well to so-called contextual selling, in which sites offer goods related to the stories on the site.</p>
        <p>The two most-visited sports content sites, CBSSportsline.com and ESPN.com, have also abandoned their in-house electronic commerce strategies, but they have taken different paths. In December, CBSSportsline sold its e-commerce business to MVP.com, which operates its own online sporting goods store, in addition to stores of corporate partners. For the right to operate the CBSSportsline store, MVP.com agreed to pay $120 million in cash over 10 years, said Michael Levy, CBSSportsline's chief executive.</p>
        <p>ESPN.com shut down its store last month, and will reopen it in mid-December. But unlike other sports sites, it will create an online sports mall where different sporting goods stores will sell their goods to customers. John Skipper, the general manager of ESPN.com, would not name the stores that will participate in the mall, but if they include all the leading sporting-goods stores, that is likely to mean that Global Sports will essentially be selling goods on ESPN.com's behalf.</p>
        <p>Whatever the case, Mr. Skipper said he was relieved to be free of e-commerce. ''We're good at creating sports content, aggregating a large audience and working with marketers to sell goods to those people,'' he said. ''We don't have expertise in figuring out what jerseys or caps to buy. Retailing is a high-risk business anyway. You exacerbate that risk by not being good at it.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 7, 2000, Thursday  The E-Commerce Report column in Business Day on Monday about sports Web sites that sell merchandise misstated the date for the reopening of ESPN.com's online store. It is mid-September, not mid-December.</p>
