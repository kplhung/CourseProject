        <p>She was a great achiever, living out the theme of success. This element could not be missed by anyone who looked. There was the Harvard medical education, followed by prestigious professional appointments. There was romance. An interlude in the Virgin Islands. There was money.</p>
        <p>These are now simply snapshots of a past that seems incompatible with the present, relics mistakenly plucked from the wrong photo album.</p>
        <p>When she appeared in Superior Court in Morristown, N.J., last Tuesday, she was the face of failure -- gaunt and abject. One of her lawyers told the judge that she was only dimly aware of why she was even there.</p>
        <p>Dr. Idella Kathleen Hagen liked to be at the center of things, and now she was at the center of an entirely unbidden world. On Aug. 26, Dr. Hagen, 54, was arrested and charged with the unimaginable -- murdering her parents, Idella Hagen, 92, and James Hagen, 86 -- apparently by suffocating them in their twin beds in their Chatham Township, N.J., home. For some time, she had been living in their basement and helping to care for them. They were frail, but the authorities do not interpret this as a mercy killing. They are unsure what it was.</p>
        <p>Inexplicable crimes cry out for texture and context, the specific dominoes that tumbled against one another to produce the unforeseen. But there are only inconclusive clues. Dr. Hagen had recently had to confront stifled expectations. She spoke to people about money shortages, though it appears she still had significant resources.</p>
        <p>Her lawyers said they were preparing a defense based on her questionable mental state. They suggested that she was severely depressed, tormented by unknown demons and wearied by lack of sleep and food. The police said she answered the door disheveled and in a rumpled nightgown. They said that when they got there, the parents had been dead for days, while their daughter continued to carry on in the house.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hagen is being held in the Morris County Jail and has not talked publicly about her predicament. The following picture of her was pieced together from documents and interviews with people who know her.</p>
        <p>It was in Chatham where she began, just as it was in Chatham where it all came crashing down. She grew up there as an only child. Her father was an optician. His work, and the ophthalmologists he intersected with, tickled an interest in medicine. In high school, she had a summer job with a doctor.</p>
        <p>She graduated from Chatham High School in 1963. The summation under her yearbook picture was: ''Her ways are the ways of pleasantness.'' Her biography disclosed that she was a graduate of Barbizon Modeling School and ''partial to a green Impala.''</p>
        <p>''She was either going to be an airplane stewardess or was going to have a modeling career,'' said Millicent Seemar of Chatham, a friend and classmate who described Dr. Hagen as a ''sweet, kind, pretty girl who was very tall and carried herself nicely.''</p>
        <p>She attended Douglass College, the women's college at Rutgers, where she met Peter A. Cook, a graduate student at Rutgers from Bedforshire, England. They were married in 1969.</p>
        <p>Much of their life together was compromised by the punishing demands that went with the training of a doctor. She graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1973, and became the first woman appointed a urology resident at Massachusetts General Hospital. She taught surgery at Harvard Medical School, and in 1982 became the chief of the urology division at Rutgers Medical School, since renamed Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and part of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''I think we came to an understanding that her principal emotional relationship was with medicine rather than with me,'' Mr. Cook said. Their marriage lasted 10 years. There were no children. Mr. Cook is now a statistician and lives in Brookline, N.H.</p>
        <p>In 1983, at a dance club at the Jersey Shore, Dr. Hagen met William Tyrrell, an industrial engineer who worked at Motion Systems, a small industrial components maker in Eatontown, N.J. The following year, they were married. It was also his second marriage, and he had two sons with his previous wife.</p>
        <p>Over the next few years, Dr. Hagen's life began to trace a new arc. She worked very hard. She was a woman in what was largely a man's specialty. And like so many doctors, she grew disenchanted with the direction of medicine under the penny-conscious strictures of managed care. Mr. Tyrrell said she would lament about how lawyers were driving doctors out of medicine. ''She felt a whole lot of people were involved in medical decisions who shouldn't be,'' he said. ''Instead of providing care to people, she was dancing to some of the tunes that insurers and whatnot played.''</p>
        <p>In 1986, Mr. Tyrrell said, she buckled under a heavy depression. She was hospitalized for several weeks. The consensus was that she suffered from bipolar disease, or manic depression. She was put on medication, Mr. Tyrrell said, and resumed her career without any obvious affects.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Tyrrell, he and his wife had talked about making a sharp change in their lives. They had taken vacations to St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands and had built a vacation house. On and off, they had pondered buying a business there.</p>
        <p>In 1987, they discovered the Villa Olga, a small hotel and restaurant in St. Thomas that had once been the Russian consulate. Mr. Tyrrell said they acquired a long-term lease on the property for about $600,000 from Richard Doumeng, the general manager of the Bolongo Bay Beach Club. Mr. Doumeng said that his impression was that the inn was more Mr. Tyrrell's dream than Dr. Hagen's, though Mr. Tyrrell said they shared it equally.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hagen converted to part-time status at the medical school and the couple moved to St. Thomas. They renamed the hotel the West Indies Inn. At a cost of several hundred thousand dollars, they enlarged it to 19 rooms from 8. For a while, things went well. Then fate dealt them several bad hands.</p>
        <p>In 1989, Hurricane Hugo ravaged the island, badly damaging the inn. But they remained open as they repaired it. Next came the Persian Gulf war and a jittery stock market, which disrupted many travelers' vacation plans. A number of airlines, including Eastern and Pan American, collapsed. The couple had guests who couldn't get flights to the island. Grudgingly, they gave up.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Mr. Tyrrell returned to New Jersey and resumed work as operations manager at Motion Systems. She stayed in St. Thomas to try to sell the lease. She remained for about a year, at which point Mr. Doumeng took it back. In the end, Mr. Tyrrell said, they wound up losing about $250,000.</p>
        <p>Though they kept their St. Thomas home, the couple resurrected their New Jersey life. They bought a clapboard house in Rumson, on the Shrewsbury River. Dr. Hagen began doing unpaid research at Robert Wood Johnson, using rats to develop a treatment for bladder cancer.</p>
        <p>But in many ways, she was dispirited. ''She quit medicine and we had to quit the hotel business,'' Mr. Tyrrell said. ''She had to be an achiever to do what she had done. When an achiever isn't achieving, they aren't as happy.''</p>
        <p>In the way that many marriages do, theirs began to unravel. They were both stubborn. ''She made sure she was the center of attention in some cases, and that didn't sit well with some people,'' Mr. Tyrrell said. If a waiter was unresponsive, she would make it clear what she thought of his inattentiveness. One time at the conclusion of a sailboat race in which they participated in St. Thomas, Mr. Tyrrell said, she had a heated argument with another competitor. After he got her into their car, he said that she was so irritated that she bit his hand.</p>
        <p>The event that clinched it came the day in 1995 that he climbed on his motorcycle to visit a friend. A few blocks from their home, he halted at a stop sign and then drove on.  He had limited vision in his left eye, the residue of a childhood bicycle incident. He didn't see a car coming from his left. It hit him, and a number of ribs were broken. His left leg was mangled.</p>
        <p>As he lay in the hospital, he faced an impossible decision. The doctors could try to save his leg, but that could mean years of operations that might prove fruitless. Or they could simply amputate it right away.</p>
        <p>His wife, Dr. Hagen, was adamant that he keep the leg, he said. ''At one point, she said to me, 'I'm not going to let anyone cut your leg off,' '' he recalled. ''I said, 'Nobody is going to tell me what I can or can't do.' ''</p>
        <p>He was not eating. He was losing a pound a day. He decided to have the leg amputated. She was enraged. This drove him to the breaking point. ''I said, 'Nuts to this,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>He never returned home. When he left the hospital, he checked into a motel. He declared their marriage over.</p>
        <p>It took more than a year for them to reach a divorce agreement, slowed perhaps by a stroke of bizarre behavior.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hagen was aware that her husband liked to visit a go-go bar near his office with co-workers. It irked her. ''She felt it was demeaning,'' said Bernard Hoffman, her divorce lawyer. ''And she was still hoping for a reconciliation.''</p>
        <p>On a Friday in September 1996, she called the place and told them that she was going to do a birthday dance on the bar for her husband. His birthday was actually in May. The bar alerted the police. She dressed in a go-go outfit and drove over. The police handcuffed her and arrested her in the parking lot. Her husband was not there. Charges against her were dismissed, but she has a lawsuit pending against the Eatontown, N.J., police, contending that they violated her civil liberties.</p>
        <p>A medical history turned over in conjunction with the suit showed that she suffered from a thyroid condition and from bipolar disorder. It said that she was taking lithium.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyrrell was earning more than $200,000 a year. She was earning nothing. Under the terms of the divorce agreement, Dr. Hagen received alimony of $65,000 a year for three years. Payments were to begin by Aug. 15, 1997. She would continue to be covered under Mr. Tyrrell's health insurance plan for the same three-year period.</p>
        <p>According to court papers, the couple had net assets of $1.6 million, most of them acquired during their marriage. Of the marital assets, she left with $780,000 and he got about $405,000. He took the Rumson house, and she took the St. Thomas one. Coupled with her prior assets, Dr. Hagen as a newly divorced woman was worth a little over $1 million.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hagen shuttled back and forth between St. Thomas and her parents' home in Chatham Township. She stopped doing research. She had an apartment built in the basement of her parents' house.</p>
        <p>She seemed to struggle for a sense of self. Everything had melted -- two careers, two marriages. She began to worry about money, more, it appears, than she had reason to.</p>
        <p>It is true that of her assets of more than $1 million, much was not liquid. It included the St. Thomas house, valued at $280,000, two Killington, Vt., condominiums of minimal net value, and retirement accounts worth more than $550,000.</p>
        <p>But she had no children. She seemed frugal. Though her alimony and health insurance were supposed to have ended by Aug. 15 under the terms of her divorce, Mr. Tyrrell said the payment schedule had been altered; she is still receiving alimony and is still covered by his insurance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook, her first husband, said she called him recently, ostensibly to discuss some possessions from their marriage, but it was clear to him that she really wanted to talk about her problems. She did not sound despondent to him, but she spoke of stresses. ''She said she was going to have to start supporting her parents,'' he said. ''She made some allusions to her parents' retirement money, about it being finite, and that unless she sold the house she was going to be in trouble.''</p>
        <p>A person familiar with Dr. Hagen's financial holdings, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that he talked with her a couple of months ago and that she was concerned about keeping up her parents' expenses, but she had not cashed in any assets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyrrell said he, too, had spoken to her recently. ''She had concerns about money, but I don't think they were founded,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Real estate agents in St. Thomas said that she put her house there up for sale on June 22 at the appealing price of $319,000, but abruptly removed it from the market three weeks later.</p>
        <p>The house does not appear to have been visited recently. Weeds have sprung up in the hand-laid blue-rock retaining walls. The water in the small dip pool is colored with algae. Inside the house, a floor lamp is on its side. Liquor bottles are stacked below the circular stairs, and detritus covers the floor.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hagen had no more career, but it is unclear why she did not seek to revive one. ''What do the astronauts do after they go to the moon?'' Mr. Tyrrell said. ''A number of them have had problems. It was hard for her to live in the aftermath of what she had achieved so early.''</p>
        <p>Then on a Saturday morning, she called the Chatham Township police. She told them who she was. She said that her parents were dead.</p>
