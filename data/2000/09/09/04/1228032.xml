        <p>Gov. George W. Bush kicked off a heated political debate when he declared that 2 of the Army's 10 active divisions were ''not ready for duty, sir.'' Had he wanted to highlight the complexities of measuring military readiness, however, he could have looked closer to home.</p>
        <p>The 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard -- nominally under the governor's command --  has the lowest ranking for wartime readiness that the Pentagon gives, according to military officials. It has been that way for the last three years.</p>
        <p>But just as the Pentagon disputes that its active-duty forces are not ready for combat, the 49th Guard division's case reveals a far more difficult question about the overall state of the American military today. It involves an arcane, sometimes subjective readiness accounting system that can be misleading and is not easily reduced to the sound bites of a presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Bush and his running mate on the Republican ticket, Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary, who has joined heartily in the criticism, do not dispute that the American military is technologically advanced, highly trained and well equipped.</p>
        <p>The real question, and one that the candidates on both sides have only glanced on, is how the next administration intends to prepare its forces, and for what and where.</p>
        <p>''It's not if you're ready,'' as a senior military officer at the Pentagon put it, ''it's what you're ready for.''</p>
        <p>The difficulty in assessing the state of today's military is that the  Pentagon's system for measuring readiness ultimately measures only one thing: fighting a major ground war with air and naval support. Any units doing anything else -- and thus not preparing for that worst case -- can run afoul of the system's subjective but merciless readiness classifications.</p>
        <p>And so the two divisions cited by Mr. Bush -- the 10th Mountain and the 1st Mechanized Infantry -- were briefly classified as unready for war last fall, not because they suffered from budget cuts and low morale, as Mr. Bush suggested, but rather because large parts of the divisions were keeping peace in Bosnia and Kosovo, according to Army and Pentagon officials.</p>
        <p>''The idea that it counts if you're training to fight Saddam but doesn't count if you're actually deploying deterring Milosevic or containing conflict in the Balkans is a strange artifact of our national military strategy, and makes little sense,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington who has informally consulted for the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>For the 49th, Governor Bush's own division, the meager readiness rating it holds may not be the best indicator of its ability to conduct military operations. According to the Pentagon's system, the 49th is unfit to fight a war. Since March, however, nearly 700 men and women of the 49th, including its headquarters company and most of its commanders, have overseen the American sector of NATO's peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and, by all accounts, doing it well.</p>
        <p>Next year, the 49th is sending roughly 300 more combat troops to Bosnia. In October, the Texas Air National Guard is sending Governor Bush's old unit, the 111th Fighter Squadron, to patrol the so-called no-fly zone over southern Iraq, where American pilots are routinely responding to Iraqi antiaircraft fire with air strikes.</p>
        <p>It is the sort of combat the unit never saw when Mr. Bush trained as a fighter pilot in the Texas National Guard during the Vietnam War.</p>
        <p>Of course, the Pentagon's accounting system serves a purpose, which is to prioritize dollars for the armed services and their combat units. The system's ratings are based on the national military strategy, which since Mr. Cheney was secretary of defense has called on the military to be prepared to fight and win two major regional wars -- in, say, the Persian Gulf and Korea -- at nearly the same time.</p>
        <p>On that scale, the Pentagon's latest quarterly readiness report to  Congress, issued last week, concluded that ''most major combat and key support forces are ready to meet assigned taskings, although there are force readiness and capability shortfalls that increase risk in executing operations.''</p>
        <p>John Hillen, a former Army captain who has been a defense policy adviser to the Bush campaign, said,  ''These things are so eminently capricious and fungible that the readiness ratings are not really significant.''</p>
        <p>''If you were a lawyer,'' Mr. Hillen said, ''you could say that, technically, both sides are right.''</p>
        <p>Under the two-war situation, the Army would need all 10 of its active divisions, supplemented by units from the Army Reserve and the National Guard, to satisfy the war plans. That is the standard by which the divisions are measured for readiness, but it is one that ignores how the Army is using its forces today and how it is likely to keep doing so, whoever is elected in November.</p>
        <p>The oddity of the readiness measuring system is that forces involved in actual military operations score lower under it. After the Persian Gulf war in 1991, several Air Force squadrons returned home only to be classified as unready since they had not been doing the training that had to be checked off to qualify as ready. Never mind that those squadrons had just returned from waging one of the most successful air campaigns in history.</p>
        <p>As long as the Army is keeping peace in Bosnia or Kosovo or conducting exercises in Kuwait or fighting fires in the Western United States, those units will not be doing what it takes to meet the system's highest standards for the war plans. After an extended peacekeeping mission, for example, it can take months for units to regain the highest level of readiness.</p>
        <p>''You face very different scenarios in a peacekeeping mission,'' said one  Army officer involved in monitoring readiness. ''You're not going to move, attack and defend the way you have to in the war-fighting mission. Those are skills that have to be practiced over and over again until they're almost subconscious.''</p>
        <p>The Army, like the other services, has begun to address the problem by relying more heavily than ever on the National Guard and Reserves. But because the Army's eight Guard divisions are not, for now, in the nation's war plans, they have received a lower priority when it comes to financing for equipment and training. The Army does not expect them to be at the highest level of readiness.</p>
        <p>Still, the 49th slipped to the lowest level three years ago because of  shortages in training time, equipment and personnel, officials in Texas and Washington said. (Even though he is commander in chief of the Texas National Guard, Mr. Bush has little impact on the 49th's readiness, since the state provides only 5 percent of the Guard's budget.)</p>
        <p>Even so, the 49th's deployment to Bosnia has freed another division to concentrate on the war mission. By the time the 29th Infantry Division from Virginia takes over the American sector in Bosnia, almost all the American troops in Bosnia will be reservists, compared with 25 percent today.</p>
        <p>The Army has gone even further, proposing to include the Guard divisions in the war plans. That would relieve the strain on the active divisions, but it could cost billions since the Guard divisions would have to bring themselves up to a higher level of readiness.</p>
        <p>So far in the campaign, neither Mr. Bush nor his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, has proposed ways to address the fundamental problems, at least as measured by the accounting system. Mr. Bush has proposed increasing the modernization budget by $20 billion to design and build new weapons systems, and raising pay and benefits by $1 billion, or nearly $750 for each person in uniform. Mr. Gore, too, has proposed increasing benefits for the troops.</p>
        <p>While those address other problems, like increasing morale or creating new weapons, they do little to fix the problems outlined by Mr. Cheney this week. Workaday needs like spare parts and training rarely transfix Congress.</p>
        <p>And no one in either campaign has talked about the easiest solution. If the next administration decided to change the national military strategy, concluding that two major wars were not very likely to happen at once, the question about whether forces are ready would disappear.</p>
        <p>''You can fix the problem,'' Mr. Hillen said, ''by changing the way you measure it.''</p>
