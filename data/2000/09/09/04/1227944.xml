        <p>One United States team was strongly placed when playoffs began here today at the World Team Championships, but another was in a close battle.</p>
        <p>The open team won its qualifying group by a large margin on Saturday and had the right, within limits, to select its playoff opponent. Its choice was Argentina, and after 32 deals, the midpoint of the match, the Americans led by 28 imps.</p>
        <p>Most of the eight matches were relatively close at the midpoint. One exception was the favored Italian team, which had won its qualifying group and built up a lead of 40 against Australia. Another was a match in which England trailed by 46 against Belgium after choosing that country as its opponent.</p>
        <p>These were the midpoint scores in the other open matches:</p>
        <p>Brazil led Indonesia by 14</p>
        <p>Norway led Russia by 35</p>
        <p>Iceland led the Netherlands by 28</p>
        <p>Poland led France by 17</p>
        <p>Sweden led Austria by 8</p>
        <p>In the women's teams, the Americans had also headed their qualifying group. They selected Scotland as their opponent and led by 5 at the midpoint.</p>
        <p>These were the midpoint scores in the other women's matches:</p>
        <p>Germany led Japan by 100</p>
        <p>China led England by 41</p>
        <p>South Africa led Austria by 22</p>
        <p>Canada led Sweden by 65</p>
        <p>Poland led Norway by 16</p>
        <p>France led Taiwan by 8</p>
        <p>Israel led the Netherlands by 22</p>
        <p>One of the six Texans representing the United States in the women's teams is Joan Jackson, who as South brought home a difficult slam on the diagramed deal from a qualifying-stage match against Brazil. The bidding requires some interpretation.</p>
        <p>The two no-trump response was natural and forcing, not denying a four-card major. Three clubs by South would have been Stayman, and the actual three-diamond bid promised a 6-card club suit. Robin Klar, North, showed a heart stopper, and South then showed spade shortness. Four clubs showed a club fit, and four diamonds was a key-card request. The response promised two key cards together with the club queen, and South settled in six clubs.</p>
        <p>It appears that South is due to lose a heart trick as well as the club ace, but Jackson found a solution. She won the spade lead in dummy and led the club queen, which was permitted to win. The club jack was led, and after winning with the ace East shifted to a diamond. South won with the ace and cashed all but one of her remaining trumps. The position was then this:</p>
        <p>Diagram</p>
        <p>On the lead of the last trump West was under pressure. She gave up a heart, as did dummy. Then the lead of a heart to the ace allowed Jackson to cash two spade winners, squeezing East in the red suits to make a well-played slam. The technical name for this was a guard squeeze: West had to preserve the diamond jack to prevent a finesse in that suit, making it clear to declarer that a heart finesse was not needed.</p>
        <p>In the replay Mildred Breed, the American West, defeated the same contract by leading a heart and the Americans gained 16 imps.</p>
