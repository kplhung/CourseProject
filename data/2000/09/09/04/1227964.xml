        <p>Abbey National, Britain's second-largest mortgage lender, has won a bidding contest to acquire Scottish Provident, an Edinburgh-based mutual life insurer for about $:2 billion, or $2.9 billion, executives close to the deal said today.</p>
        <p>British mortgage lenders are increasingly looking to diversify their businesses into other sectors as competition has brought down margins in their traditional mortgage and savings lines of business.</p>
        <p>Abbey National's bid beat offers by Royal London and Liverpool and Victoria, ending a five-month auction for the Scottish life insurance concern, the executives said.</p>
        <p>Abbey National hopes to use its  extensive branch network to sell Scottish Provident's products, as well as those of Scottish Mutual, a life insurer it acquired in 1992.</p>
        <p>Executives close to the deal said Scottish Provident would sell its 38 percent stake in Aberdeen Asset Management before it was sold to Abbey National.</p>
        <p>Analysts have estimated that Aberdeen could be worth as much as $:400 million, or $585.6 million.</p>
        <p>As part of the deal, Aberdeen will still manage Scottish Provident's funds under contract, the executives said.</p>
