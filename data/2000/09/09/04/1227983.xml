        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: SCHOOL PROJECTS TO START  The first emergency projects financed by New Jersey's historic $8.6 billion school construction legislation are due to get under way this fall, state officials said. Initial work will include fixing roofs and wiring. Some expansion and construction could begin this year, but schools must wait until at least next summer for bigger projects, which the state must review, said Dave Mortimer, assistant commissioner in the Department of Education. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed legislation on July 18 to begin the state's largest wave of school building ever.  (AP)</p>

        <p>KEANSBURG: WATERS CLAIM 2  One man disappeared in Raritan Bay, and another man's body was found in the Delaware River yesterday, the authorities said. The first man, whose identity was withheld, was aboard a friend's boat a mile off Keansburg, when he jumped into the 6-foot-deep water at 12:55 a.m. and vanished, the Coast Guard reported. A search was suspended yesterday after nearly 10 hours. The body of the second man, Gilson Vidal DeSouza, 24, a carpenter from Brazil, was found in 15 feet of water at 10:20 a.m., about 50 yards from where he had disappeared in the Delaware River Saturday afternoon, said the State Police. The police said Mr. DeSouza and five friends were in waist-deep water in Ewing Township, north of Trenton, when they came to a 10-foot-deep channel he was unable to cross.  (NYT)</p>

        <p>BRONX: WASTE PERMIT REJECTED  An administrative law judge has temporarily blocked a permit from the State Department of Environmental Conservation that would have allowed a New Jersey company to build a barge-to-rail trash transfer station in Hunts Point. In her Aug. 25 ruling, Judge Helene G. Goldberger found that the department failed to require the company to explain how it would prevent odors and air pollution. She ordered the department to review the granting of the permit. The company, American Marine Rail of Englewood, N.J., seeks to ship up to 5,200 tons of trash per day. (NYT)</p>
        <p>ALBANY: ENERGY GROUP INVESTIGATED  Three government agencies are investigating a regional energy trading cooperative, the Independent System Operator, to find out if sales under its auspices have contributed to higher bills for some New Yorkers. The State Public Service Commission, State Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are looking into the cooperative, one of the utility-pricing organizations created in the wake of deregulation. The cooperative has drawn attention because of wide price fluctuations in deals it has sponsored.  (AP)</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: CALLS TO STOP TELEMARKETERS  Residents are inundating a state agency with phone calls and e-mail messages in an effort to stop annoying phone calls to their homes. The calls are in response to a new law that allows the public to contact the State Department of Consumer Protection and get on a ''no call'' list. Starting in January, it will be illegal for businesses doing phone solicitation in Connecticut to call people on the list.</p>
