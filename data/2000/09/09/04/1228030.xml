        <p>Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri dealt a crushing electoral blow to Lebanon's Syrian-appointed government in final parliamentary voting today, early results showed, sweeping all of Beirut's seats and gaining a powerful majority of backers in Parliament.</p>
        <p>In a modern, extravagantly financed campaign the likes of which this traditionally clan-dominated city had never seen, thousands of supporters of the swashbuckling multibillionaire swarmed into the streets to vote in overwhelming numbers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hariri's campaigners were clustered on street corners throughout the city all day, clad in blue, green and tan T-shirts bearing his visage. Twelve hours of criss-crossing the city turned up only four workers in orange T-shirts distributing cards for his Sunni Muslim rival, Prime Minister Salim al-Hoss.</p>
        <p>Official vote totals are to be announced on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''Eighteen of eighteen.'' Salim Diab, Mr. Hariri's campaign manager, said in his headquarters an hour after the polls closed, indicating they had won all the seats contested, as supporters danced and cheered outside.</p>
        <p>While the voting in one of the bitterest campaigns ever here was far from eliminating Syria's hold on Lebanon -- since all of the major figures here, not least Mr. Hariri himself, have ties to Damascus -- it appears to have drastically altered the political status quo.</p>
        <p>In essence, Mr. Hariri defeated the two men handpicked as Lebanon's leaders two years ago by Bashar al-Assad, the untried 34-year-old heir to Syrian power, during his internship here in preparation for assuming the mantle of his father, Hafez al-Assad, who had run both countries with wily, ruthless skill.</p>
        <p>President Emile Lahoud, the Maronite Catholic former military commander whom the young Mr. Assad chose to be president in 1998, detests Mr. Hariri and mounted a strong campaign with all the government's resources against him, including hours of denunciation on the state-run television station.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Hoss, the prime minister and a political fixture for decades, lost his seat in Parliament despite efforts by Syria to gerrymander Beirut into three electoral districts and guarantee his victory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoss, an academic who has been prime minister during some of Lebanon's darkest days, is widely regarded as a decent and honest man, unusually immune from corruption but totally ineffective.</p>
        <p>The conventional political wisdom here was that tradition -- along with Syria's desire to see a number of possibly contending Sunni Muslim  leaders -- would make safe the seats of Mr. Hoss and of Tamman Salam, the son of the late Saab Salam, the longtime zaim, or leader, of Beirut's major family and a former prime minister, himself.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Beirut newspapers have reported in recent days that both the Syrians and the powerful interior minister, Michel Murr, had warned Mr. Hariri that an ''immoderate'' victory would only cause more friction.</p>
        <p>But, in what many analysts see as the most significant measure of Mr.  Hariri's victory, both Mr. Hoss and Mr. Salam, according to the early results, were swept away in the landslide.</p>
        <p>It is a stunning political turnaround. Only a month and a half ago, political pundits here were writing that President Lahoud was hoping for a two-thirds majority in Parliament so that the Constitution could be amended to extend his six-year term, which expires in 2004.</p>
        <p>Instead, with the battering the government took in last week's round of elections -- with 41 of 63 seats going to the opposition -- and today's voting for the 128-seat body, he is faced with the prospect of either accepting, or trying to find a way around naming, his sworn enemy, Mr. Hariri, as prime minister.</p>
        <p>In addition to the 18 seats Mr. Hariri appeared to have won in Beirut -- along with another seat he gained in a backroom deal with the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah on Friday -- he is expected to be supported by 23 winning candidates on the joint Amal-Hezbollah ticket in southern Lebanon and at least a dozen more from the Bekaa region in today's voting.</p>
        <p>The 1989 Taif agreement that helped end the 15-year civil war here says that the president must appoint the prime minister with the support of a simple majority of Parliament. And the removal of Mr. Hoss and Mr. Salam from the political scene puts President Lahoud and the Syrians in a further bind. Under the unwritten National Accord here, the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim and the alternative pool of prominent candidates is now sharply reduced.</p>
        <p>As prime minister between 1992 and 1998, Mr. Hariri built a series of showy projects, including a rebuilding of the graceful old city center, a ruined battleground called the Green Line during the civil war. But President Lahoud, who in his inaugural address denounced all Lebanese politicians as a class, accuses him of corruption and driving the country into overwhelming debt.</p>
        <p>And in the last two years, conditions have only gotten worse with debt service now outrunning government revenue, unemployment rising and the young and educated fleeing. Mr. Hariri's comeback is based both on this rising economic discontent and on his own carefully crafted campaign, the cost of which the leading Lebanese newspaper An Nahar estimated at $50 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diab, the former prime minister's campaign manager, said that Mr. Hariri's operation had 8,000 workers on the streets of Beirut today, along with roughly 3,000 cars and taxicabs to ferry voters to the polls. There were even ambulances to take sick people out to vote.</p>
