        <p>A Brooklyn man has been arrested  and charged with attacking four young women as they jogged or walked alone in Park Slope and nearby neighborhoods over the weekend, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Michael Bowden, 30, was arrested in a surveillance operation quickly organized by the police to catch the attacker before he struck again, said Capt. Timothy V. Horner, a Brooklyn detective commander.</p>
        <p>Captain Horner said that in each attack, Mr. Bowden pulled a 1986 Volvo near an unaccompanied woman in her 20's and tried to pull her into the car. All the women managed to break free, the police said. They said that one victim was sexually abused before she escaped and that three were placed in choke holds.</p>
        <p>The four attacks occurred between 8 p.m. Friday and 11 a.m. Saturday, the police said. The attacker struck in Park Slope and Prospect Park on Friday night, and in Park Slope and Windsor Terrace on Saturday morning.</p>
        <p>After the police noticed a pattern, detectives from the 78th Precinct detective squad and the borough-wide Special Victims Squad traced the license plate number supplied by a victim to a Volvo that had been loaned to Mr. Bowden by a relative, Captain Horner said.</p>
        <p>Detectives were assigned to four surveillance points in neighborhoods that Mr. Bowden was known to frequent, and a description of him and the Volvo was broadcast to officers on patrol citywide.</p>
        <p>At 10:45 p.m. Saturday, Officers Robert Carlson and James Halleran pulled over the Volvo on Fulton Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant and arrested Mr. Bowden without incident. He was charged with several counts of attempted murder and unlawful imprisonment, one count of sex abuse and one count of robbery stemming from the theft of $2 from one of the women.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowden, of 1118 Lincoln Place in Crown Heights, had no record of violent or sexual crimes, the police said. He was arrested three times between 1987 and 1994 on charges of drug possession and sale and served time in prison at least once, for a 1994 conviction for selling marijuana, the police said.</p>
        <p>Captain Horner said the police were investigating whether Mr. Bowden tried to force other women into his car besides the four who reported being attacked. ''We only know of these four incidents, but there could have been more,'' he said. ''We're looking for anybody who possibly has more information.''</p>
