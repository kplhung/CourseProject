        <p>After touring a secret nuclear submarine base on Russia's Pacific coast, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson indicated today that he would support a Kremlin request for help in building a high-security storage site for nuclear fuel from decommissioned Russian subs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson and other American experts, including Assistant Secretary of Defense Ted Warner, were given broad access to the naval base at Petropavlovsk, on the Kamchatka Peninsula, where roughly 20 submarines already are docked and awaiting dismantling.</p>
        <p>The Russian Navy has asked the United States to assume half the cost of building a $200 million floating dry-dock that would store radioactive reactor casings and nuclear fuel. United States law allows for such aid, but only when it can be clearly shown to benefit American national security.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview today from Anchorage, a stopover on his return flight to Washington, Mr. Richardson said he believed the site was needed to protect Russian reactor fuels from the dangers of terrorist theft and so-called insider sales by Russians desperate for money.</p>
        <p>''It's going to take some hard work,'' he said, to convince the Congress ''that this is a worthy project; that it makes sense to defuel and decommission these nuclear subs on the basis of nonproliferation. But we think it makes sense to make this a priority.''</p>
        <p>A senior Energy Department official said the Russian Navy had made a convincing case that it lacks the money to dismantle and defuel the subs by itself. Nor do the 20 submarines appear sufficiently seaworthy to be towed to the nearest port, at Vladivostok, where another American-built site could accommodate the fuel and reactor parts.</p>
        <p>''The navy says that if you try to tow these subs, they'll break apart and we'll end up with reactors on the bottom,'' that official said. ''And nobody wants that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson's Kamchatka stop concluded a weeklong swing through the former Soviet Union that was largely devoted to promoting nuclear nonproliferation and improving good will with his Russian counterparts. Americans on the trip have said they are impressed with the openness of the Russians, who have escorted them through an atomic weapons plant and, today, a nuclear sub base, despite obvious tensions in the American-Russian relationship.</p>
        <p>Most recently, some Russian military leaders have stopped barely short of accusing the United States or other NATO powers of sinking the Russian submarine Kursk and killing 118 Russian sailors, in a covered-up collision.</p>
        <p>''The signal thing about this trip today was the degree to which the navy was willing to come forward and say, 'We have a huge problem and all our historic concerns about secrecy, we're going to drop,' '' the senior Energy Department official said. ''In contrast to the back-and-forth with the Kursk, this was like night and day.''</p>
        <p>In Kamchatka, the vessels marked for dismantling range from older attack submarines armed with torpedoes to more modern boats designed for launching cruise missiles.</p>
        <p>American officials said many date from the 1980's and have been lying fallow, rusting at their piers, during much of Russia's decade-long history as an independent state.</p>
        <p>Under the proposal outlined today, the American money would help build an interim storage site for reactor parts and fuel, while the Russians would pay for dismantling the remainder of the subs. The reactor fuel, which the Russians say is pure enough to be used in nuclear weapons, would be shipped to a plant in the Ural Mountains for reprocessing into fuel for nuclear power plants.</p>
        <p>The reactor casings would remain at the submarine base indefinitely, until Russian can choose and build a permanent waste-disposal site for radioactive materials. The United States, which also lacks a permanent waste-disposal site, keeps its own nuclear waste at interim storage facilities like the one contemplated in Petropavlovsk.</p>
        <p>Separately, the Kremlin announced today that the two nations have signed a treaty committing each government to dispose of 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium, either by converting it to nuclear-reactor fuel or by immobilizing it in a nuclear-waste disposal site.</p>
        <p>The treaty, which was signed in Moscow on Aug. 29 and in Washington on Friday, would abolish enough plutonium to manufacture thousands of nuclear weapons. Both sides agreed to remove at least two tons of plutonium from circulation each year, beginning no later than 2007, and to seek help from other nations to double that figure.</p>
        <p>The United States will spend about $4 billion to carry out its obligations under the treaty. Russia will spend about $1.7 billion, and the United States has promised to help Moscow secure international loans to help pay that cost.</p>
