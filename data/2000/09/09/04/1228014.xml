        <p>It is now 23 matches and counting, but Venus Williams didn't know much about her winning streak until a reporter mentioned it to her last week.</p>
        <p>After showing a trace of vulnerability in her third-round match Friday against Meghan Shaughnessy, the third-seeded Williams eliminated Magui Serna, 6-2, 6-2, in 53 minutes yesterday to advance to the quarterfinals. Her victory came after she waited around the National Tennis Center for more than five hours during two rain delays and wound up playing yet another late-afternoon match.</p>

        <p>It is now 23 matches and counting, but Venus Williams didn't know much about her winning streak until a reporter mentioned it to her last week.</p>
        <p>After showing a trace of vulnerability in her third-round match Friday against Meghan Shaughnessy, the third-seeded Williams eliminated Magui Serna, 6-2, 6-2, in 53 minutes yesterday to advance to the quarterfinals. Her victory came after she waited around the National Tennis Center for more than five hours during two rain delays and wound up playing yet another late-afternoon match.</p>
        <p>''It was pretty disappointing,'' Williams said. She passed the time by nibbling on food every hour. ''I'll never get away from this place,'' she said with a laugh.</p>
        <p>Not that she wants to do so anytime soon. ''In the first couple of rounds I was not playing well,'' Williams said. ''But I feel more warmed up and in a groove, more ready to compete.''</p>
        <p>After struggling with her serve in the third round, Williams was much more efficient yesterday, winning 74 percent of her first-serve points. She also had 24 winners to Serna's five.</p>
        <p>The last match Williams lost was to Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, in the quarterfinals at the French Open. But Williams will not get a rematch because the eight-seeded Nathalie Tauziat defeated Sanchez-Vicario, who was seeded ninth, in straight sets.</p>
        <p>''It has never been one of my goals to have a winning streak, so this is nice,'' said Williams, whose streak includes her run to the Wimbledon title.</p>
        <p>Williams was clear about one goal,  not wanting to partake in a battle of the sexes. After John McEnroe said that any male college player or senior player could beat Venus or her sister, Serena, a volley of words ensued, prompting Donald Trump to propose a $1 million match between either sister and McEnroe.</p>
        <p>''I think that back in the '70's, Billie Jean King did it the right way,'' Williams said, referring to King's match in the Astrodome against Bobby Riggs. ''Right now I'm just really focusing on trying to win this U.S. Open more than anything, just have a good result here, just competing with the women.</p>
        <p>''At some later date,'' Williams added, ''I'll be ready to think about competing with men. At this point, I'm ready to just play the Open.''</p>
        <p>Richard Williams, her father, already said that neither she nor Serena would participate anyway.</p>
        <p>''I knew Richard was a smart guy and this only reinforces that fact,'' McEnroe said yesterday. ''Richard knows it's best to keep his daughters away from Johnny Mac.''</p>
        <p>As an aside, McEnroe added, ''By the way, Trump's offer was a good start.''</p>
        <p>A Garden Exhibition</p>
        <p>The Women's Tennis Association Tour will sever its 29-year affiliation with Madison Square Garden after this year and hold its year-end championships in Munich.</p>
        <p>The Chase Championships, a weeklong event beginning Nov. 13 this year, will move to Germany and begin three weeks earlier, in October 2001.</p>
        <p>The Garden's contract with the WTA was up after this year, and while the Garden made a bid to renew the deal, the WTA made an agreement with Munich tournament officials worth about $1 million more in prize money.</p>
        <p>''It was disappointing,'' said Joel Fisher, senior vice president of MSG Sports. ''We would have loved them back. We made what we felt was a very fair offer, but we couldn't go any further and we had to make the correct business decision. They felt they had a better offer.''</p>
        <p>This will not mean the end of women's tennis in the Garden. Fisher said the Garden was negotiating to establish an annual exhibition with six of the top women's players at about the same time in November, but for fewer days.</p>
        <p>''I do feel that in the end it will work out well,'' Fisher said. ''We're pretty far along in our discussions and agreement. We're proceeding forward as if we were having an event. I think we're going to start asking players now.''</p>
        <p>Officials at the Garden are trying to negotiate with International Management Group, which works with several top players, including Venus and Serena Williams, Lindsay Davenport and Monica Seles.</p>
        <p>While Seles will play the coming Chase Championships in New York, she will not play in them next year in Munich because she has not played a tournament in Germany since being stabbed by a fan during a crossover in a Hamburg tournament in 1993.</p>
        <p>Madison Square Garden's proposed replacement event will be an exhibition because the WTA season will have already ended. Fisher said he hoped the top players would be attracted by the prize money and the opportunity to play in the Garden.</p>
        <p>''That's what the draw will be,'' he said. ''We feel the responsibility for the fans in New York, and we think that major women's tennis is on a real upswing. It's bittersweet, but it's also very exciting, and a new opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Lee Hits the Town</p>
        <p>Hyung-Taik Lee, the surprise fourth-round opponent of Pete Sampras today, went on an afternoon escapade through Flushing's Korean section yesterday after he practiced  at the National Tennis Center. At two restaurants, owners and staff showed him respectful attention.</p>
        <p>When Lee, 24, a qualifier from Seoul, South Korea, walked into the Korean-owned sushi restaurant Nam Sam, the owner quickly called up her friends, who soon arrived en masse to get Lee's autograph. After hors d'oeuvres there, Lee and his coaches went down Northern Boulevard to Kum Kang San to eat Korean barbecue.</p>
        <p>Lee, who was ranked No. 182 in the world entering the Open, is the first Korean man to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam. In 1981, a Korean woman, Duk Hee Lee, advanced to the fourth round of the United States Open before losing to Hana Mandlikova.</p>
        <p>Lee was ranked No. 182 in the world entering this Open. In 1995 the Korean Sung-Hee Park surged to No. 57 in the WTA ranking, but she advanced only as far as the second round in a Grand Slam event.</p>
